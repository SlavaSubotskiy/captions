2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,000
How do we recognize those teachers

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,450
that You might call fraudulent from the real ones?

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,890
It’s so difficult because they all seem to be able to

5
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:20,009
inspire us in certain ways and give us experiences.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,090
How do we know who is teaching something that’s true

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,650
and who is being deceptive?

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,410
First and foremost thing is:

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,010
anybody who lives on your earnings is not a guru.

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,210
A guru will never live on the earnings of his disciples.

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,050
But here there are people who have big palaces,

12
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,810
bought aircrafts and cars and this.

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,450
I mean, this is something one should understand. It’s so,

14
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,810
so open to you to understand.

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,850
I mean, I cannot understand more obvious thing that this one is

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,570
that it’s a parasitic living.

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,370
And you cannot have a parasites as your gurus.

18
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,050
They can be parasites but not your gurus.

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,010
That’s one of the things. And if you can…

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,330
I mean, you can retain some people, you know?

21
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,490
If you want because you are rich people, you can retain some.

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,490
That’s a different point. But you cannot have them as gurus.

23
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,810
Guru has to be a higher personality, you see?

24
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,490
Now you have seen Christ was such a great incarnation.

25
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,690
He didn’t take any money from anyone.

26
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,250
He was a carpenter’s son and He used to do carpentry Himself

27
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,130
and He lived like a modest man.

28
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,450
He never lived with big cars and big houses. It’s not necessary

29
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,330
because such a person is Himself, He is a very big king, you see,

30
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,570
like a big emperor.

31
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,570
He doesn’t need anything, an emperor doesn’t need anything

32
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,410
because nothing can give him comfort

33
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,210
except that He Himself is in complete comfort.

34
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,650
So such a person doesn’t want anything.

35
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,050
So you must see that such a person has no needs of comfort at all.

36
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,890
He can sleep on the grounds, he can sleep anywhere.

37
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,970
Now, in this life,

38
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,410
I should say I come from a quite a wealthy family

39
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,890
or married to another wealthy man, you can say that way,

40
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,930
according to your own relative ideas.

41
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,290
But to Me,

42
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,610
I can sleep anywhere. I have no problem.

43
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,090
I have no problem of food,

44
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,930
no problem of sleeping anywhere, no comfort.

45
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,610
And I find it is beyond My self-respect

46
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,490
to live on the earnings of others. It’s not proper.

47
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,890
But you are My children;

48
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,370
supposing now you bring a flower to Me or something, it’s all right.

49
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,050
But I can’t have a palace out of your money and all those things.

50
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,810
It’s absurd, absolutely absurd!

51
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,810
So this is one thing one should know that it pampers our ego,

52
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,090
that we can purchase our guru,

53
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,410
we can purchase our Self-Realization.

54
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,690
You see, this is a very subtle pampering.

55
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,730
And that’s how people accept, you see?

56
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,210
They don’t want to accept a person who says,

57
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,010
“You cannot offer anything.”  It’s too much for them.

58
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,810
Or maybe that, secondly, could be that people think

59
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,810
that if you pay something then you get attached to it,

60
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,730
you go through it whatever it is.

61
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,130
Say you have paid for a ticket

62
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,050
and you find that the whole play is horrid, you can’t bear it,

63
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,730
but you have to go through it because you have paid for it.

64
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,330
That’s a human nature, you see?

65
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,850
That’s a human nature. I have seen that they do it.

66
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,690
And that’s what it works out.

67
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,010
But this is very gross level, I’m telling you.

68
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,970
But another should be that in these modern times it is promised

69
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,650
that you will become prophets.

70
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,410
You have to become prophets.

71
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,010
So you must see have you become prophets out of these?

72
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,850
Is... easiest is to see the disciples of this man,

73
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,050
any XYZ who says he is a guru.

74
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,490
Now what is happening to the disciple? Is he a free person?

75
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,490
Has he got any knowledge?

76
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,330
Has he got any mastery?

77
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,730
What has he achieved by being with that person?

78
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,050
Now, you have seen here there are Sahaja Yogis.

79
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,410
One better than the other!

80
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,130
You talk to them, they are knowledge.

81
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,850
Some of them have met Me only for, say, eight day or so.

82
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,210
They have become knowledge.

83
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,450
So what have they achieved you should say.

84
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,450
What is their style of life, their pattern of life, how they behave?

85
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,010
And there cannot be any privacy about it,

86
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,450
you see, like mafia -

87
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,930
you don’t tell that and you don’t say that

88
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,330
and you shouldn’t do that.

89
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,490
Of course, in Sahaja Yoga

90
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,450
the truth is exposed gradually,

91
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,450
but it is not like this that if you give some money, nobody knows.

92
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,170
Everybody knows everything in Sahaja Yoga, you see?

93
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,930
Now supposing we have to build an ashram, say for example.

94
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,650
All right, you build your ashram, you collect your money,

95
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,690
do what you like and know about it. I have nothing to do with it.

96
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,490
Also among yourself you should know how you got the money,

97
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,970
how you spent it, what is the expense and all that.

98
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,690
Because ashram you can pay for

99
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,290
but not for your Realization.

100
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,930
And this is one thing is very important,

101
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,570
that what you get out of it is important,

102
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,410
that you should become a prophet.

103
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,170
Have you become a prophet?

104
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,530
Then, thirdly, you must know that if you are going from one to another,

105
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,010
what we call guru shopping business; that means you have not found it.

106
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,930
Otherwise, you would just settle down.

107
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,330
But some people are so weak that they do settle down with one

108
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,370
and are finished with them.

109
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,290
You must always see the people

110
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,250
who go to these gurus, what have they got.

111
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,850
Have they got their transformation?

112
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,850
Because this is the age of transformation.

113
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,250
Mataji, what about teachers or gurus who produce miracles?

114
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,530
You go to a guru

115
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,890
who materialize something out of the air and say, “This is divine”.

116
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,410
That’s a very serious question.

117
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,330
This is all jugglery. It’s all jugglery.

118
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,770
And also, you see, now supposing somebody says,

119
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,490
“I produce a diamond”.

120
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,290
Now these people come from India.

121
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,290
Why don’t they solve the financial problem of India?

122
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,010
Secondly, you see, at every point they can be challenged.

123
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,090
You should say that, "Then, all right"...

124
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,930
One gentleman came to Me; he said that, “He gave me a diamond.”

125
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,930
I said, “Why you? How many diamonds you have?”

126
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,410
He has said, “Hundreds.” Then I said, “Why did he give you?

127
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,250
He should give to your driver who hasn’t got a diamond”.

128
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,130
You see, that is what it is. So it is all jugglery.

129
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,090
You should see those who materialize,

130
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,210
what have they given you?

131
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,690
They have to give you something eternal.

132
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,330
If they talk about God,

133
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,170
God is not going to give you diamond.

134
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,130
Which God has given diamonds to people?

135
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,570
Have you heard of anyone giving diamonds? No!

136
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,570
So you should ask for something which is the highest,

137
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,810
which is the supreme most.

138
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,570
Now the fourth thing, which is very important,

139
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,010
that whatever experiences you get -

140
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,610
for example, some people start just like jumping,

141
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,970
some start shouting, some start behaving like animals.

142
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,330
And they say, “Oh, that’s what is coming out.

143
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,050
You are taking out, you see.”

144
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,170
They feel very bad, they get horrible diseases,

145
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,810
they get into troubles and they get into pains

146
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,010
and all sorts of things and contortions.

147
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,530
They say, “Now, your subconscious is coming out”.

148
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,890
Nothing has to be brought out. That’s one thing you must know.

149
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,970
The subconscious, as I told you, is on the left hand side

150
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,650
and the supraconscious on the right hand side.

151
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,370
What you have to do is to ascend in the center and come up.

152
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,410
Above your head is the super-consciousness

153
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,370
and when you become that,

154
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,210
then you develop collective consciousness.

155
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,170
So those who want you to become like frogs again,

156
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,250
you must know that you are not going to become frogs anymore.

157
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,250
That’s not anyway evolution.

158
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,090
The evolution has to go higher,

159
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,170
not becoming frogs or earthworms, you see?

160
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,730
And if you start crawling, it is simple mesmerism.

161
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,010
Anybody mesmerizes can do these tricks, you see?

162
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,570
It’s simple mesmerism.

163
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,970
And then to believe that now you are surrendered and all that

164
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,690
is all nonsense, you see?

165
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,210
It has no meaning to Realization.

166
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,850
In Realization, you just become the master.

167
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,010
You become the master of it.

168
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,250
There are many people in this country who came

169
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,330
and lured you by their talks also,

170
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,610
talking big about Brahma, Atmatattva, this, that and everything.

171
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,090
That is not the way you can,

172
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,330
that is what is just the pendulum moving

173
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,170
from Christian sermon to Hindu sermon

174
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,850
and from Hindu sermon to Islamic sermon,

175
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,130
from there to the Rabbi sermon.

176
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,090
You see, it goes on like that, you see? That’s not the way.

177
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,330
You have to rise higher within yourself.

178
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,970
And that’s why those who lecture about these things

179
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,930
are really sometimes can be very, very dangerous.

180
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,130
And so many have died of cancer, this, that.

181
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,370
I don’t know what to say that people who go to these people

182
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,490
get into very bad troubles and suffer so much.

183
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,010
And then on top of that when all this happens,

184
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,410
they say, “You must suffer.”

185
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,290
That’s a very good excuse, “You must suffer”.
You must pay to suffer.

186
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,170
Pay money to suffer.

187
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,530
And then people go on suffering.

188
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,010
Now one thing I have to tell you that Christ has suffered for us.

189
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,970
We don’t have to suffer anymore.

190
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,570
Those who deny His sufferings, will have to go for suffering.

191
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,330
All right, have it! But He suffered for us.

192
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,010
There is no need for us to suffer anymore.

193
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,170
When He is awakened within us,

194
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,530
He takes away all that is our ego means our karmas,

195
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,250
our superego, that is our conditioning, completely removed,

196
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,650
and you become one with the Divine.

197
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,090
There is no need for anybody to suffer

198
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,010
and this idea of suffering is all nonsensical.

199
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,170
You should not suffer at all.

200
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,170
Good!
