00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,841
Shri Mahavira Jayanti Puja 28 mei 1991, Gidgegannup, Perth, AustraliÃ«

2
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:10,601
Today we are going to celebrate the

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,160
birthday of Mahavira.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,320
Mahavira is the incarnation of Bhairavanath,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,360
or you call Him as Saint Michael.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,200
Now these two saints as you know

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,840
one as the Gabriel, Hanumana,

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,200
and another is Saint Michael.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,080
One is placed on the Pingala Nadi

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,000
and another one, Saint Michael, on the Ida Nadi.

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,080
So,

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,600
Mahavira

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,440
had to go through

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,680
lots of search.

15
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,960
Of course He was a

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,760
angel, but came as human being

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,800
and He had to find out

18
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,560
the thing of the left side,

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,600
and how the left side acts.

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,400
It's a very complicated thing, left side,

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,440
is much more complicated than right side.

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,960
On the left side we have also seven nadis,

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:08,160
and these seven nadis are placed one after another.

24
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,800
They are described in books and given different names to them.

25
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,440
Now these seven nadis that are on the left side,

26
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,640
as you know, they cater to our past.

27
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,520
Say for example, every moment becomes a past.

28
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,160
Every present becomes a past.

29
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,080
Then we have past of this lifetime,

30
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,480
and also we have past of our previous lives.

31
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,200
Then all the past is built in within us

32
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,600
since our creation.

33
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,160
So all the psychosomatic diseases, as you know,

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,000
are only triggered by

35
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,440
the entities that appear

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,520
from the left side.

37
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,920
For a person, supposing he is suffering, say, from liver trouble

38
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,600
and suddenly he's attacked from the left side,

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
specially Mooladhara,

40
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,480
or any left side, left Nabhi,

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,680
because Mooladhara is the only one that is connected

42
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,880
with the left side, Ida Nadi,

43
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,160
and the right side PingalaNadi is connected with Swadisthana.

44
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,040
So the problems of Mooladhara

45
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,360
are really beyond the reach of human beings,

46
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,760
and when it is attacked,

47
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,400
any one of these chakras on the left-hand side,

48
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,280
then psychosomatic diseases

49
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,760
occur into human beings.

50
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,440
As I have told you many-a-times, now this is the center,

51
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,880
this is the another center, left and
right, they are on top of each other.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,280
And using the right side too much,

53
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,760
goes up to a point and suddenly something happens

54
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,960
on the left, triggers.

55
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,560
So all diseases, say even diabetes,

56
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,760
is due to the psychosomatic efect.

57
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,200
A person who is very hard-working, thinks too much,

58
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,640
very right-sided,

59
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,480
suddenly something happens,

60
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,480
maybe also he might inherit that diabetes

61
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,200
because of the past, and it triggers

62
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,280
and you get this psychosomatic problem.

63
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,080
Now this psychosomatic problem

64
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,800
is only cured if you know what's the problem of the left side is.

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,920
So Mahavira went quite deep on to the left side.

66
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,040
Why I said it's difficult the left side is, because

67
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,960
when you start moving on the left side

68
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,600
the movement becomes linear of course,

69
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,520
but it moves downward,

70
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,240
while the movement on the right side moves upward.

71
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,840
So the movement goes down like that,

72
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,680
and then it coils up,

73
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,360
forms coils,

74
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,560
and you go on moving with it

75
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,120
so you are lost in the coil.

76
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,000
But the other one moves upward

77
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,680
and the coils are not so many,

78
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,880
and because it is upward it's easy to get out of it.

79
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,240
So those people who go to the left,

80
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,280
by any chance, by thinking too much about their past,

81
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,640
crying about themselves and always complaining,

82
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,480
are more difficult than the people on the right side.

83
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,400
But the right side people are troublesome to others,

84
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,040
while the left side people are troublesome to themselves.

85
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,960
That's how this left side

86
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,120
was to be found out properly, was done by Mahavira.

87
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Of course He knew also, I think, all about it.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,720
So He has mentioned practically,

89
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,480
in details, lots of things that can happen to a person

90
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,720
who goes to the left side.

91
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,840
He gave the idea of hell.

92
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,680
He also described seven types of hell.

93
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,240
I mean it's so horrible that I don't want to tell you

94
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,520
what is hell is,

95
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,680
horrifyingly cruel,

96
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,560
horrifyingly joyless

97
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,520
and horrifyingly so repulsive that

98
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,160
you hate yourself when you understand

99
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,200
you have committed this mistake,

100
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,920
you have committed this pap,  this

101
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
sin;

102
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,080
and then what is the result,

103
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,240
what you get - the punishment part.

104
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,160
Mahavira worked it out everything,

105
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,480
He has given in all details what sort of punishment

106
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,000
is due to a human being who tries to be left-sided.

107
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,120
Also He has given about the person who is right-sided,

108
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,000
but not to that extent

109
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,560
because He had to deal with the combination,

110
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,080
but mostly with the left side.

111
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,280
As I have told many people before and here also I perhaps maybe,

112
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,440
that there is a soul that is

113
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,400
made out of the causal bodies

114
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,040
of all the five elements.

115
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,240
The causal, say for example, of the earth is fragrance.

116
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,400
So this

117
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,760
soul which is made of the five causal bodies

118
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,080
and your centers,

119
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,760
plus we can say, also

120
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,800
it has got the control over the parasympathetic,

121
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,760
it sits on the spinal cord from outside

122
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,480
and activates the parasympathetic nervous system.

123
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,480
So it has a connection with every center.

124
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,640
Now this is the soul when we die,

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:04,040
with the Kundalini and our Spirit goes into the sky

126
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,960
and it is the soul that guides now

127
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,560
the movement of our being, whatever is left now

128
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,040
into a new being and that's how it works out.

129
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,080
So everything that we have done so far

130
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,920
is recorded in that soul.

131
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,760
When you were asking Me, "Mother, we see some sort of

132
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,280
round, round things, you see, lying together.

133
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,720
What is that?"

134
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,640
I told you this is our, this is a dead soul.

135
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,440
And now they have found out what I have told them.

136
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,440
Because, you see, when a person dies

137
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,440
his soul shows you - like even now you can see,

138
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,680
round, round things:

139
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,440
there could be many, there could be one, a string -

140
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,080
and they saw it under a microscope when I told them,

141
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:12,480
that the soul within us is reflected on the cell,

142
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,400
which is the reflector of every cell.

143
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,560
So the part of the cell which is the reflector,

144
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:30,320
which is placed on one side of the cell

145
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,880
also has this soul reflected,

146
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,880
and the main soul which is on the back

147
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,560
controls that

148
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,720
reflected soul which looks after every cell.

149
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,000
Now they have found out that there is in that reflector

150
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,760
this kind of seven loops,

151
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,160
seven loops because it sits on the eight â

152
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,720
seven chakras and the Mooladhara.

153
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,120
Now what He found out that, when people die

154
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,000
then some of the souls

155
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:30,440
are born again just after few days,

156
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,560
and these people are just very ordinary type of people,

157
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,960
that's how He brought in a kind of category.

158
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,880
So they are - the people who have died -

159
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,880
they are of a category, one category,

160
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,800
where they exist for a very short time

161
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,440
in the collective subconscious

162
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:04,840
and then they take their rebirth.

163
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,320
They are very ordinary people,

164
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,000
aimless, useless people.

165
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,720
But there are some souls when they die,

166
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,120
they just hang in the air

167
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,240
and they are just waiting to find out somebody

168
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,000
who will fulfill their desires

169
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,720
which are not yet fulfilled.

170
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,400
Like there's a drunkard and a drunkard,

171
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,440
can join another human being who's living,

172
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,400
who would like to drink.

173
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,000
So once he starts getting this...

174
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,960
So once it starts

175
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:24,440
getting into the habit of drinking,

176
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,600
some of these souls can just jump on that person,

177
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,520
and when they jump on that person

178
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,560
they can make him a real drunkard.

179
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,400
I remember of a lady who was a very short, petite person,

180
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,880
came from Cuba,

181
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,400
in America when I went first,

182
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,240
and she told Me that she's very sick of herself.

183
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,680
And her husband told Me that she can take

184
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,320
one whisky bottle, full, neat sometimes.

185
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,520
Looked at her, such a little thing. I said "How can she do it?"

186
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:07,440
So, I put a bandhan on her and I saw a huge big Negro

187
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,400
standing behind her.

188
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,400
So I said, "Do you know some Negro?"

189
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,440
Immediately she jumped on Me. She said,

190
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,320
"Mother, You see that one?

191
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,520
You see that one, that's the one drinks, not me."

192
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,880
Of course I cured her

193
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,960
and after that she gave up drinking completely.

194
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:32,360
So whenever you start getting into a habit in a bad way,

195
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,040
you lose complete control of yourself

196
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,640
and a spirit sits on you, and it controls you.

197
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,600
And when it controls you,

198
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,480
you do not know how to get rid of any habit.

199
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,160
That's why it's difficult to get rid of habits.

200
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,040
Now in Sahaja Yoga when the Kundalini rises what happens

201
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,520
that these spirits, these dead spirits

202
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,760
leave you and you become all right and you give up.

203
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,200
That's how it works.

204
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,440
I would say that all this Mahavira did not tell,

205
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,400
nor did He find out all these things,

206
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,640
because He was not a scientist, I think, or I don't know why.

207
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,880
But what He has talked about is the hell.

208
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,680
And He has said that if you do this kind of thing

209
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,760
in your lifetime, then what kind of a hell you'll get,

210
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,080
and He has described the hell in a very,

211
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,520
I should say, openly and in a very detailed manner.

212
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,440
And it's really horrible to know

213
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,360
that a human being who thinks no end of himself

214
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,120
ultimately will get to that kind of a hell

215
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,880
and some are permanently doomed to be there.

216
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,200
But as incarnations take birth,

217
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,120
also these devils, some of them

218
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,000
who are completely doomed to live in hell,

219
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,800
also take their birth.

220
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,520
And when they take their birth, they try to trouble us,

221
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,840
and they can take birth as, as you know, as our gurus

222
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,600
and things. And everything is happening now,

223
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,600
you find it how these people are taking their birth

224
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,080
and how they are misleading us.

225
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,680
How they are using the left Swadisthana

226
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,240
or we can call it the left side

227
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,240
just to immobilize us completely.

228
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,000
So when a person is possessed, as you must have seen,

229
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,960
a person gets possessed he cannot feel vibrations -

230
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,120
there are all kinds of symptoms about such a person.

231
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,920
But in Sahaja Yoga what do we do

232
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,720
is to take the name of Mahavira,

233
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,040
because Mahavira runs all the way, all the way on the Ida Nadi

234
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,200
and comes and stays here onto the -

235
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,200
we can say the point which is for our superego.

236
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,080
And it sees, controls, works out, cleanses

237
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
and does all that is required

238
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,480
to put a person right after Sahaja Yoga.

239
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,680
So we have to be really very thankful to Him

240
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,600
for doing this kind of work which is very filthy and dirty;

241
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,360
because these people don't mind even

242
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,480
sitting in the bathroom, like that you can say,

243
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,360
or sitting with everything and meditating.

244
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,000
They can do anything, they are very dirty people,

245
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,400
absolutely dirty.

246
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,080
When they become tantrikas they try all kinds of dirty things,

247
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,760
and with that they actually create a problem

248
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,240
between themselves and the God.

249
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,880
Say they'll go to a temple of a Goddess

250
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,440
and start misbehaving with a woman there,

251
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,600
so the Goddess will disappear;

252
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,080
and once the Goddess disappears in that area,

253
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,560
they call all these bhoots from the left side.

254
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,880
So now we have all these souls which are lying, hanging in the air,

255
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,760
trying to come back

256
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,280
to a conscious thing and to possess someone.

257
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,280
Plus these, we have these masters of the left side

258
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,640
who know how to catch hold of these people

259
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,960
and put them on somebody,

260
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,960
or to remove from them someone and to put somebody else.

261
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,000
So it's a continuous process,

262
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,200
and this makes a person absolutely mad and good for nothing.

263
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,560
Now when we know all this,

264
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,560
still we get caught up on the left side.

265
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,080
Sahaja Yogis do get caught up.

266
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,520
That's why I think this Mahavira Jayanti

267
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,760
is a very, very great day for us to observe.

268
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,360
Now why was He called Mahavira?

269
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,440
Because only a person like Him - Vir means a person who is brave,

270
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,800
who is chivalrous - because only He could do this.

271
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,120
So only He could enter into the being fully

272
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,880
and could kill or you can say destroy

273
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,040
those horrible rakshasas, devils,

274
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,560
all these negative things that come to us.

275
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,440
Now as you know we use left side very much

276
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,840
for so many negativity that is torturing us;

277
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,720
but if there is no help,

278
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,680
say, from Mahavira we cannot do it.

279
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
We  call the name of Mahavira -

280
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,840
you could call Him Saint Michael, you can call Him by any name,

281
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,240
but Mahavira because He was a human being.

282
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,600
All this works out because of Him

283
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
and He is such a great identity.

284
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,840
He, Himself took a birth as a human being.

285
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,880
Difficult for saints to take birth as human being.

286
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Moreover, you see, the

287
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,600
whole concept

288
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,840
of hell and all that is described

289
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,320
in any scripture is a fact: it exists.

290
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,800
And if you try to go in there, you see,

291
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,760
when I try to go there and to find out,

292
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,600
I just go off to sleep sort of thing. In My sleep I find out

293
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,080
all the things that are happening about a person,

294
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,480
how much he's caught up, what he's done.

295
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,600
It's a - not a easy thing to do with the conscious mind.

296
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,920
You have to take to the subconscious

297
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,800
and you have to go into sushupti, in a deeper sleep

298
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,280
to see what's happening in the left side.

299
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,640
It's a very funny situation, I think,

300
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,720
and for Sahaja Yogis also to enter in it, I would not advise it.

301
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,880
But one should get rid of the problems of the left side

302
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,040
with the help of Mahavira.

303
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,760
When this chakra is caught up what you find is a big

304
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,040
lump of bone coming out on the right side.

305
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,360
So you have to take the name of Mahavira

306
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,480
just to remove that pressure from the left side.

307
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,480
Now many people do not even know why they suffer:

308
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,320
Why should they suffer when they have done nothing wrong?

309
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,480
Because they are possessed.

310
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,680
Now even the viruses and all these things

311
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,040
like psychosomatic troubles, like cancer -

312
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,320
all, I would say the incurable diseases

313
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,280
are there because we are triggered into the left side,

314
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,760
and that's why we are suffering from these diseases

315
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,480
which are not curable.

316
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,600
So we have to thank really very much Mahavira

317
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,120
who has given us this power

318
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,960
to remove our left-sided problems,

319
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:01,040
who has given us this light in our hand,

320
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,320
which He Himself vibrates

321
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,920
and He, Himself tries to throw some light

322
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,480
on the obscure things - about Me also.

323
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,640
Because of Him only

324
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,720
we can get cured

325
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,640
of so many physical and mental troubles.

326
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,920
You know that the left side can be easily cured

327
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,200
if you use three-candle treatment.

328
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,040
That shows Mahavira is only fond of light,

329
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,960
He doesn't like darkness.

330
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,000
And His idea is, I think that way,

331
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,080
is to now fully go all the way

332
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,040
to clear the left side as far as possible,

333
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,240
to help Sahaja Yoga to be established

334
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,320
in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there,

335
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,120
lot of it.

336
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,600
So He is working it out, everywhere,

337
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,760
and the psychosomatic diseases and all these diseases

338
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,120
also we can work it out with candle light and all that,

339
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,280
with three-candle we can do this treatment.

340
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,480
So we have to be very thankful to Him

341
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,200
that He has achieved this kind of entry

342
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,360
into the left side and has found out for us

343
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,720
what sort of problems exist on the left side.

344
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,480
It's such a nice thing that we have got today the chance

345
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,880
to celebrate His birthday here

346
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,200
in a place which is really very much loved by Him.

347
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,200
Now we may say that Mahavira is sometimes seen

348
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,200
as a person who is naked.

349
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,200
So it happened that He had gone in a jungle to meditate

350
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,320
and to find out about the left side

351
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,600
and when He got up, you see,

352
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,080
He got caught up in one of the bushes

353
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:14,160
and He had to torn off half part of that.

354
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,920
When that half part was torn off,

355
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,200
then He came out of those bushes and He was all right,

356
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,880
but at the same time Shri Krishna appeared there on the scene

357
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,560
as a little boy from a village

358
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,680
and He said that "I'm a poor man,"

359
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,080
this little boy said, "I am a poor person, I have nothing with Me.

360
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,000
You are a king. You can always get your clothes.

361
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:46,440
Why don't you give Me Your, this half cloth that You have?"

362
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:53,360
And, they say so that it was given to this boy

363
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,760
and who ran away.

364
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,560
He was nobody else but Shri Vishnu.

365
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,880
And this, you see, Vishnu took away that cloth

366
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,480
and of hardly for about two seconds or three seconds

367
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,440
because He was a king you see,

368
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,360
and He hid Himself with leaves

369
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,680
and He went to His palace and got dressed.

370
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,400
But imagine, the people, how negative they are.

371
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,400
They just walk without clothes - Jainies.

372
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,800
They have, you see, all kinds of taboos

373
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,520
against all the worms, everything.

374
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,600
It's said, these people have started,

375
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,680
that if you do not respect these little, little animals,

376
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,400
like you can a, even serpent

377
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,880
or any animal which is troublesome and bad,

378
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,960
but is a living thing, so it's to be preserved.

379
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,880
Now these Jains are mad.

380
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,720
I told you that they have gone to such a limit of vegetarianism

381
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,120
that they try to save even the bugs,

382
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,400
put the bugs in a hut,

383
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,840
and the hut has got a brahmin there.

384
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,120
Now these bugs suck the blood of this brahmin

385
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,880
and once the brahmin is

386
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,240
completely, I mean I should say, sucked in

387
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,320
by these bugs, they fall on the ground.

388
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,160
Then they allow the brahmin to come out

389
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,480
and they give him a lot of dakshina, means

390
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,720
they give him money as a reward

391
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,640
for helping the bugs to suck his blood.

392
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,960
This kind of vegetarianism is there.

393
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,680
Beware of vegetarians. You see even Hitler was a vegetarian

394
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,720
so you can imagine what sort of a vegetarianism it is.

395
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,720
All these fads of vegetarianism and all that

396
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,960
are not at all required,

397
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,000
and that's what Mahavira showed in His life,

398
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,040
that it is not at all important to bother about food,

399
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,040
what they should eat.

400
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,880
See, the whole theory of this vegetarianism has gone

401
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,400
to such a nonsensical limits that I have told people

402
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,200
that we should give up vegetarianism, completely.

403
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,320
Now also see the juxtaposition of what He wanted to do.

404
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,880
If you do not eat proteins you cannot fight bhoots.

405
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,080
A person who has bhoots in him must eat a lot of proteins,

406
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,120
not carbohydrates but proteins, so that

407
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,320
it can fight those left-sided enemies.

408
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,640
But here it is they have to be vegetarians.

409
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,080
Now imagine they have left-sided enemies within them

410
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,920
and they want to be vegetarians.

411
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,400
Finished. How will they fight it?

412
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,960
So all this is all we should say is pre-planned

413
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,880
by the person who tries to, sort of say is -

414
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,960
we can say like that, you see, a person

415
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,440
who tries to remove the -

416
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,080
or we can say that the person who tries to make the,

417
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,720
these lower animals live,

418
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,480
rather than human beings, you see they're oppressors.

419
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,400
This is the stupid thing they do.

420
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,280
Must know that I cannot give Realization to these worms

421
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:32,360
and to these fishes, or even to chickens.

422
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,640
We require human beings.

423
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:43,600
So all this has happened because of human beings

424
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,640
going in juxtaposition of whatever is said.

425
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,280
Like Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,"

426
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,600
and I've yet to come across a Christian

427
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,160
who is not a Sahaja Yogi, without adulterous eyes,

428
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,200
whether it's a woman or a man.

429
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,960
So we go just the opposite of what we have been taught.

430
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,200
In the case of same thing happened that Mahavira,

431
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,520
what He tried to do was absolutely killed

432
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,480
by these people who are trying

433
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,480
to make this vegetarianism as a big religion.

434
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,240
Also another thing was that this vegetarianism

435
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,760
came into Jainism through one fellow called Neminath

436
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,320
who was a tirthankar at the time of Shri Krishna.

437
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,160
He was to be married. In those days they were married,

438
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,480
not only but they were eating all kinds of meats

439
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,440
and so many lambs and goats came for the wedding of this man

440
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,640
so he felt that - uparati we call it, this:

441
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,280
he didn't like it, he was disgusted, he was frustrated with that.

442
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,880
With that frustration what did he do?

443
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,680
He said, "I will not eat meat."

444
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,880
And that's how vegetarianism started among Jainies.

445
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,320
And that's how it's still going on,

446
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,440
and these Jainies I find are the
joyless people, absolutely joyless.

447
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,240
They're so much fond of money, they run after the money

448
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,800
and they go on behaving in such a peculiar way

449
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,960
that you can't understand, I mean they are

450
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,560
human beings but the way they behave you can't

451
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,240
understand them, they're not normal people.

452
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,960
So we realize that despite all that Mahavira worked out,

453
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:45,600
still the people are supposed to be His disciples,

454
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,760
they are Jains, and they are like this.

455
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,360
So what we have to do now is to understand

456
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,000
that in Sahaja Yoga we'd better not do something of that kind.

457
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,445
Whatever you are told, you have to understand why it is so,

458
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:02,175
you know the modus operandi,

459
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:04,480
you know each and everything about Sahaja Yoga.

460
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,280
You know the whole subject

461
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,040
so it's not proper for you to in any way,

462
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,560
to succumb to any such arguments

463
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,440
or any such big, big talks or big, big

464
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,880
advertisement and take to something that is wrong.

465
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,120
It's very important.

466
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,000
We are Sahaja Yogis and we understand the balance.

467
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,640
Of course I always say that Westerners for example,

468
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,480
maybe Australians also,

469
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,360
should take more to carbohydrates because they eat a lot of meat.

470
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,400
So they can take to carbohydrates,

471
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,080
but that doesn't mean vegetarianism by any chance.

472
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,120
I mean, to compensate.

473
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,840
And in India I always say they must take to more meats,

474
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,760
as will do, do them good.

475
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,440
But then by no means I say that you just eat meat and nothing else.

476
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,920
But a balance has to be found out,

477
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,720
and once you strike it

478
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,760
then you'll be surprised that you'll feel so relaxed, so much better,

479
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,200
so much enlightened

480
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,960
and the vibrations will flow much better than normally.

481
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,600
So for food, you have to be careful.

482
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,520
Same about with clothes

483
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,200
that you shouldn't go mad after a suit all the time

484
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,560
whether it's hot or cold or indifferent.

485
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,240
What you have to do is to wear something that will suit you.

486
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,400
Now for example, in a climate like this

487
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,120
you may require a suit or something to cover yourself,

488
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,600
but supposing you are in Ganapatipule

489
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,280
or some place like that where it's not so cold

490
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,160
or so hot, maybe it's dry.

491
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,520
So what sort of a dress you should wear which is comfortable,

492
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,600
that should be found out. And whatever you find out

493
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,000
that this is such a comfortable dress for us,

494
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,920
you'd better do it.

495
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:55,520
Because what I have seen in many - you see, it's a thing that

496
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,560
whenever I tell you something,

497
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,840
don't take it to the extremes

498
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,760
and don't take a little bit of it.

499
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,360
But when I tell you this thing, you must understand

500
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,640
that whatever is good for you,

501
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,480
whatever is your temperament, whatever is aptitude,

502
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,120
you have to take something that will nourish that,

503
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,240
that will improve you and give you a balance.

504
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,680
So to balance yourself, if you think of Mahavira

505
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,440
you must think also of Shri Hanumana,

506
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,520
both these things are important.

507
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,440
It's not easy to tell all about Mahavira in this short lecture,

508
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,800
but I think I have quite connected Him now with Sahaj,

509
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,400
and you must have seen to it that how important He is

510
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,840
and what an important role He plays.

511
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,200
So May God bless you.

512
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,760
Just start thinking about Mahavira I just,

513
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,160
it's impossible to keep into the conscious mind,

514
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,440
it's just going into the left all the time.

515
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,880
Because I just in the car thought I'd better think about Mahavira

516
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,600
and since then it's all going towards the left, it's so difficult.

517
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,160
But it will work out.

518
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,120
May God bless you!

519
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,520
Terrible thing this left side is.

520
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,960
I think if you have any problems you must ask Me also,

521
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,840
because this is the only time

522
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,880
when we can talk about things.

523
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,520
If you have any problems you can ask Me, about left side:

524
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,840
how to correct it,

525
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,480
how to work it out, anything. Please ask Me.

526
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,440
Because you always get this problem.

527
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,600
What's it? Can't hear.

528
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,960
A yogi asks about the feeling

529
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,480
of pins and needles and the left heart

530
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,000
Now heart as I told you is the reflection of God Almighty,

531
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,960
which is the Spirit.

532
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,880
So we have two types of heart troubles as I told you before also.

533
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,800
One is, is when you have a overactive life, right-sided,

534
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,000
and the left-sided is the lethargic heart

535
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,920
when you get angina and all that.

536
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,800
Now in your case, your case where you feel

537
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,880
there is something pricking you,  that means it's a possession.

538
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,880
If the hands are, sort of pins and needles

539
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,480
then it's kind of possession.

540
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,520
But it can be cleared out.

541
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,960
Any other question?

542
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,840
Can You say something about left Nabhi, Mother?

543
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,760
That's a different area, though

544
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,840
left Nabhi comes from the relationship

545
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,960
between a wife and a husband mostly.

546
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:59,440
But a wife who is a complaining type, is very sort of a,

547
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,880
all the time grudging,

548
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,760
very nervous and bothers the husband,

549
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,920
frightened and all sorts of things that they do.

550
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,840
You see just sometimes they do it just to trouble the husband,

551
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,000
but sometimes basically

552
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,480
they are very left-sided, possessed women.

553
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:27,840
And these possessed women give you this left Nabhi.

554
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,880
Any woman who feels the left Nabhi,

555
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,800
she must immediately understand that there's some sort of

556
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,960
a horrible thing in her being which has to go out.

557
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,800
So for left Nabhi you must take to three candle treatment

558
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,880
and try to respect your husband, try to be kind to him.

559
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,880
Because these spirits can also dominate,

560
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
you know, not that, they can make you very sly,

561
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,000
they can also dominate, they have a way of dominating.

562
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,880
So in any case it looks as if a woman

563
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,840
might look to be right-sided,

564
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
but actually she's suffering from left Nabhi

565
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,760
and she's extremely dominating.

566
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,840
In the same way, if the husband is not a good man

567
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,920
and he tortures the wife and she feels unhappy about it

568
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,880
and she's sorry about it,

569
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,760
then also she catches the left Nahbi.

570
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,960
So in both cases one has to understand

571
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,960
that you get your joy,

572
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,800
the source of joy is your Self, your own spirit.

573
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,960
It doesn't depend on your husband or anyone,

574
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,920
you are single that way.

575
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,960
So you shouldn't worry about your husband,

576
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,760
you shouldn't think how he treats you,

577
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,920
you shouldn't bother at all about him.

578
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,920
But what you have to think is that "After all, I'm his wife,

579
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,800
I should support him, I should help him.

580
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,000
Whatever way he is,

581
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,880
let him be as he is,

582
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,880
because he won't get corrected even if I tell him.

583
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,760
So the best thing is I'd better not tell him anything.

584
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,560
Let him do whatever he likes."

585
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,000
And you clear out your left Nahbi with the candle.

586
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,560
That's the way.

587
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,480
All right, we'll get the children to wash My feet now.

588
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,880
It's so very difficult, left side is still there. I'm just...

589
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,560
Hello.

590
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,000
You all get to come here to wash My feet â all right?

591
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,480
So beautiful!

592
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,400
Mantras

593
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,400
Ganesha Sthuthi

594
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,880
Who knows all the Ganesha Sthuthi to be sung?

595
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,400
Or you know Atharva Sheersh?

596
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,800
Because Ganesha is the One, you see,

597
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,760
who is sitting on Mooladhara,

598
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,800
and it is He who is the One who puts you onto the left side.

599
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,800
He throws you all the time.

600
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,840
And it is Mahavira who tries to save you and to correct you.

601
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,400
So there are two forces working.

602
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,520
Take this.

603
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,920
He says he has got the names of Bhairavanath,

604
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,760
so itâs very good.

605
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,800
So you can come and wash My hands,

606
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,840
those who are leaders here.

607
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,640
Leaders! Big joke about them!

608
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Somebody should come here to put all the things.

609
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,480
Who can do it?

610
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,000
Now what â somebody?

611
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,600
One by one you can come and put the water in.

612
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,440
Just put the water.

613
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,480
No, no, not the â¦ You have to do it.

614
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,440
Now, one by one, come along.

615
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:46,560
First of all is the honey. Call him.

616
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,480
Take that one. This other one. â¦

617
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,600
We need you again. â¦

618
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,880
Be careful. It should not touch your fingers â¦

619
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,640
What is, this is clean?â¦

620
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,560
I thought it was â¦

621
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,520
From Melbourne, somebody can come â¦

622
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,560
What is that?

623
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:58,400
These are the Ida Nadi names.

624
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,400
Unmarried girls.

625
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,480
With this finger you do like that, on both the sides.

626
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,480
Debbie, come and do it.

627
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,480
Yes, itâs all right.

628
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:41,560
Just beyond that. Just put the line like that.

629
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:38,480
This side. Itâs to be done like this.

630
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:43,520
And on the back.

631
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:49,480
You then have to put it under My, on the sole.

632
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,600
You can move all the things.

633
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,440
Are you doing on this side as well?

634
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,520
Also down there. You have to complete as well.

635
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,480
Thatâs all done.

636
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:29,560
To the line, up to the line you have to do the same thing.

637
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:36,400
Whole thing up there. Yes. All right. And more.

638
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,600
Just to the line, you just do that.

639
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,480
Thatâs good.

640
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,400
Still complete it.

641
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,400
Yes, correct. Yes, thatâs it.

642
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:26,480
I mean, whatever youâve put, more of that.

643
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:32,480
Thatâs it. Thatâs correct.

644
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,840
Now, I mean, extra that you have on My fingers â

645
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,560
on My toes, just take it out.

646
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,400
Now, can you get some married ladies also?

647
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:24,000
Too much. With your hands, take it out.

648
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:28,880
Thatâs better. Take this also.

649
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,560
Be careful. Donât spoil the line. Donât spoil the line.

650
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:41,400
This line you should not spoil.

651
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:49,480
Yes, be careful. Itâs all right.

652
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,880
Thereâs so much to be done.

653
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:30,440
Thereâs a sari here. Just wipe your hand on this â¦.

654
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,560
Now, what you can do is to get the sari.

655
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,480
Brought the sari?

656
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,480
Take it down there. All right.

657
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,920
Call one of them, who are other assisting, in front.

658
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,640
The girls have to sit here.

659
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:09,400
Yes, this one â¦ Give it to her, with a â¦

660
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:17,560
You can take that coconut.

661
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,600
Bangles.

662
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:52,440
You see, there are small and big.

663
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,440
because itâs two-and-a-half â¦

664
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,440
Better let them come now.

665
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,560
They have to come.

666
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,520
You have to do the sari.

667
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:35,000
Now you have to organise these flowers, under My feet,

668
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,880
but all the white under My feet,

669
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,600
ones on the side â¦

670
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:54,600
So you put all the white, and Iâll put My feet afterwards.

671
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:19,520
Now the light colors, like pink.

672
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:45,440
Leaders â¦

673
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:08,480
Namaskar â¦

674
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,480
May God bless you all. May God bless you.

675
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:40,560
See how everything is quiet.

676
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:42,920
Just before Aarti it started raining,

677
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:48,400
and now see â¦ beautiful. All right.
