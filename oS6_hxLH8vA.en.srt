1
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:50,253
Now, we are starting a New Year,

2
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:58,116
and I wish you all a very happy and
prosperous New Year.

3
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:18,163
In this wish of Mine I also wish you a very
deep growth in Sahaja Yoga.

4
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:36,569
Now you all are Sahaja Yogis and you all
have to become masters in Sahaja Yoga.

5
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:48,414
For becoming masters in Sahaja Yoga I am
sure you are doing meditation, introspection

6
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:56,136
and all kinds of Sahaja Yoga rituals,
I should say.

7
00:10:00,878 --> 00:10:11,240
In this New Year, I’ll think there is
greater chance

8
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:17,177
for you to do much better,

9
00:10:17,895 --> 00:10:25,684
because all those years of ordeals are
over.

10
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:40,553
We are now entering into the New Era. I say
now the Satya Yuga is established.

11
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:52,594
In the beginning you may not feel
the atmosphere

12
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:58,735
of Kali Yuga being cleared out completely.

13
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:05,889
Of course, gradually you’ll find that’s all
clearing out

14
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:13,875
and all the people who are dangerous
for your spiritual life,

15
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:24,523
for your national life, for your family
life, will have to take back their way;

16
00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:28,281
they cannot be successful here.

17
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:43,250
Now the Sahaja Yogis have to decide how far
they will spread Sahaja Yoga all over.

18
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:47,702
How many people can get into Sahaja Yoga?

19
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:54,422
There should be many more waiting for you
this year,

20
00:11:54,623 --> 00:12:01,422
and maybe this year, if you all decide to
work it out, I am sure

21
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:09,788
you can get lots of people who will be
saved from the curses of Kali Yuga.

22
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:17,914
This is going to be your vow on the New
Year day,

23
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:25,266
that now we are going to start Sahaja Yoga
in a new way,

24
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:29,639
in a bigger way, in a more dynamic way.

25
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:37,743
For that, first thing is needed is your
Sangha Shakti, that is your collectivity.

26
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:45,063
This collectivity has to be extremely well
built-in, well made,

27
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:50,795
well understood and absolutely loveable.

28
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:58,375
This is not difficult in Sahaja Yoga,
because practically all your jealousies,

29
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:08,107
all your baser ideas have been completely
washed out by your Kundalini.

30
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:15,047
She has transformed you, you are different
people; you are very, very different.

31
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:23,835
Not only that, but you have now understood
yourselves.

32
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:29,875
You are knowing your Self. And all those
who know their self

33
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:33,564
cannot fight with each other.

34
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:42,725
Because this Self is the reflection of one
person,

35
00:13:42,926 --> 00:13:50,960
of one Deity, of one God. And so how can
you fight?

36
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:58,725
When He is within your heart, how can you
fight with each other?

37
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:02,703
When He, otherwise you’ll be fighting
with yourself.

38
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:07,297
It would be very, very stupid to do that.

39
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:15,756
So all the fights and all the funny things
that you have been thinking about

40
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:21,842
will of course disappear, no doubt. But
you’ll become very dynamic.

41
00:14:22,043 --> 00:14:26,280
You’ll be amazed at your dynamism. Just you
have to rise;

42
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:32,350
just you have to expect your Self
to manifest.

43
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:39,149
You can become very, very collective,
progressive

44
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,779
and you can create many Sahaja Yogis.

45
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:52,641
You have been given Realization; you have
been given the knowledge of Realization;

46
00:14:52,842 --> 00:15:00,586
whatever was possible has been done
for your health and prosperity,

47
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:10,178
but now it’s your duty to repay to
the Divine by your creative methods.

48
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:13,764
You have to be very creative.

49
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:22,031
You'll find so many people in this world
are full of lots of problems,

50
00:15:22,232 --> 00:15:28,663
which you have got out of it. But you can
help them.

51
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:33,662
You don’t need any help because you are
yourself full of power –

52
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:40,790
power of Divinity within you. This Divine
power should be used.

53
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:46,704
It’s not given just to be rusted. This
power has to be used.

54
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,955
Otherwise what’s the use of becoming
powerful?

55
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:55,987
Supposing we have electrical power here,
and it doesn’t even give light,

56
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,807
so what’s the use of having electrical
power?

57
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:05,900
So the power that you have is for
the emancipation of human beings.

58
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:16,104
It is for you to raise the Kundalini
of people – you can do it.

59
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:19,291
One person can do it for thousands!

60
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:25,792
And I hope now you take up this
responsibility upon yourself.

61
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:31,848
This would be the greatest blessing for
you, for Sahaja Yoga

62
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:39,801
and for the whole world. Because in My
vision, we have to change the whole world.

63
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:43,746
I don’t know in My lifetime if I can
achieve it or not.

64
00:16:43,947 --> 00:16:47,534
But if you people really join hands with Me,

65
00:16:47,735 --> 00:16:53,348
with full effort, it will work out.

66
00:16:53,549 --> 00:17:02,840
Firstly I hear many people don’t go
to meditation, into collective meditation.

67
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:10,770
They do not join together. It’s surprising
after so many years of work I’ve done –

68
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:16,528
thirty years I’ve been working, and there
are some, some people

69
00:17:16,729 --> 00:17:23,487
who take Sahaja Yoga for granted. You don’t
understand your responsibility.

70
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:27,965
You have to meditate collectively.

71
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:33,088
Whenever there is collective meditation
you must join that.

72
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:41,502
You can also start something in your areas,
a collective meditation.

73
00:17:41,703 --> 00:17:47,752
And it will work out. Many people who are
in Sahaja Yoga

74
00:17:47,953 --> 00:17:51,588
are now meditating, I can make them out.

75
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:55,987
I know who are the ones who are meditating
and who are not.

76
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:59,848
It’s not difficult to make it out. And then
you come out

77
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:05,403
with other problems like my mother’s,
father’s, uncle’s – this thing.

78
00:18:05,604 --> 00:18:11,590
There’s no need to worry about that. Even
if you are a realized soul,

79
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:18,807
and when you are connected with the Divine,
even your own wish will be fulfilled.

80
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:27,090
But it does not. Why? Because you still do
not understand what you have become.

81
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:33,635
You first try giving Realizations to others.
See what joy you feel.

82
00:18:33,836 --> 00:18:39,106
Tremendous joy. This joy you cannot get
in anything else.

83
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:43,994
Whatever you may buy, whatever you may
have,

84
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:48,574
you cannot get this joy of giving
Realization.

85
00:18:48,775 --> 00:18:54,246
And you will be so very happy; not because
you expect anything,

86
00:18:54,447 --> 00:19:01,051
you want anything, nothing of the kind –
but only thing is pure joy –

87
00:19:01,252 --> 00:19:08,823
pure joy of creating great Sahaja Yogis.
This is what you are there.

88
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:18,028
This is what the Divine wants you to do.
Not just to take advantage of Divine power:

89
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:23,090
“Cure my father, cure my mother, cure
my sister… ”

90
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:27,621
or else, “I haven’t got properties…” Then
somebody says,

91
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:34,371
“My husband ill-treats me…” or some wife
says that… so the husband says this...

92
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:37,792
It’s going on and on and on. Forget it!

93
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:41,738
You are now above everything, above all
these things.

94
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:47,168
And you have become absolutely powerful,
believe Me.

95
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:52,776
If you haven’t used your power, then how
will you know what powers you have got?

96
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:57,653
It’s as simple as that. Those who have
used it

97
00:19:57,854 --> 00:20:02,770
go on telling Me what miracles they had,
what things have happened to them,

98
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:08,838
how they were protected, whatever they
wanted – how they got it.

99
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:15,934
But see, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot be
hypocritical. If you have hypocrisy,

100
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:19,323
Sahaja Yoga knows, the Divine knows
you are a hypocritical.

101
00:20:19,524 --> 00:20:24,715
It is for your good, for your growth you
have to be in Sahaja Yoga.

102
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:29,090
It’s not for somebody else that you are
doing it, but for yourself.

103
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:36,567
When people are that powerful I am
amazed, how they easily they can get cured.

104
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:41,620
But they must meditate, and they must join
collective meditation.

105
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:46,299
Most of the people don’t join collective
meditation. I am surprised.

106
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,688
I know, sometimes, say in Delhi, there is
no sufficient space,

107
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:56,736
so people have to come twice, either
Saturday or Sunday;

108
00:20:56,937 --> 00:21:00,138
some of them have to wait outside –
doesn’t matter.

109
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:04,502
But going for the collective meditation,

110
00:21:04,703 --> 00:21:10,900
you’ll be amazed that Divinity is flowing
there. Vibrations are flowing there.

111
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:18,469
I am there. It’s not that you are just
going there just as a ritual.

112
00:21:18,703 --> 00:21:26,664
Problem is you people don’t realize that you
have to be responsible for Sahaja Yoga,

113
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:33,877
responsible for giving Realizations
to others and attend

114
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:41,227
all the programs you have of meditation.

115
00:21:41,428 --> 00:21:45,768
With collective meditation you get
all right.

116
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:52,342
All your problems are solved if you go to
the collective meditation regularly –

117
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:58,979
I promise you! But the problem is you won’t
go; you will write letters to Me,

118
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:04,313
you want to meet Me. This is not going
to help.

119
00:22:04,514 --> 00:22:09,557
You may come and trouble Me like that, or
do something like that, but doesn’t help.

120
00:22:09,758 --> 00:22:19,500
What helps that you help yourself. Next
year is going to be a great year for you.

121
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:26,562
In the West now I was surprised how things
are spreading fast.

122
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:36,188
In Russia the people are so deep – so deep.

123
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:43,532
Once they get Realization, they understand
the value of Realization.

124
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:49,314
They are so humble, and so deep, they don’t
want anything.

125
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:54,861
They’ve never desired for anything. Though
they have gone through horrible

126
00:22:55,062 --> 00:23:02,110
problems of communism, and now this
reaction to that.

127
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:11,197
Despite that, all these five countries
which I call as ‘real’

128
00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:18,484
Divine countries, because the way they have
accepted it.

129
00:23:19,094 --> 00:23:22,836
They are poor according to the modern
standards,

130
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:27,812
but from their heart they are very,
very rich.

131
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:34,328
From their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,
they are very, very rich.

132
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:40,860
And their scientists are so well qualified.
In every type of thing now,

133
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:48,314
there is one scientist who has come
to India and who has discovered a method

134
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:53,658
by which you can see all the chakras, and
the Kundalini

135
00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:59,744
and the obstructions and everything –
something he can show you.

136
00:23:59,945 --> 00:24:07,760
While our scientists are busy opposing Me.
Little knowledge is very dangerous.

137
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:11,688
They don’t want to see what I am doing and
how I am doing it.

138
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:17,986
They just want to criticize Me – all
so-called intellectuals.

139
00:24:18,187 --> 00:24:20,360
Especially in Maharashtra,

140
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:24,822
the intellectuals – I think they are
something has gone wrong with their heads.

141
00:24:25,023 --> 00:24:30,643
They cannot understand Sahaja Yoga. Just
beyond them.

142
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:37,041
What has happened to them I don’t know,
but they just can’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

143
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:42,643
And these Maharashtrians are so busy with
their rituals.

144
00:24:42,844 --> 00:24:46,649
Four o’clock in the morning they’ll get up,
take their baths, do this,

145
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:51,768
then start doing their Pujas, this, that.

146
00:24:51,969 --> 00:24:56,407
Now somebody got sick, so his wife writes
to Me,

147
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:59,969
“We didn’t go to any temple, we didn’t do
any rituals,

148
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,204
still my husband has got sick.” Imagine.

149
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:07,955
As if doing by that you mean you are
a Sahaja Yogi.

150
00:25:08,156 --> 00:25:12,486
If you are a real Sahaja Yogi, then nothing
can happen to you.

151
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:16,580
But you have been just under wrong
impression.

152
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:22,011
Whether you go to temple, or whether you go
to wrong places

153
00:25:22,212 --> 00:25:29,355
and do all kinds of rituals – it has never
helped anyone.

154
00:25:29,556 --> 00:25:35,964
So first you have to empty yourself. If you
are already filled with these ideas,

155
00:25:36,165 --> 00:25:41,501
these age old ideas, and you are still
carrying on with them,

156
00:25:41,702 --> 00:25:43,886
how can the Divine be filled?

157
00:25:44,087 --> 00:25:50,355
If there’s a pot already full of water or
anything – you cannot fill it.

158
00:25:50,556 --> 00:25:58,306
So you have to empty it completely. Empty
yourself, empty your mind.

159
00:25:58,507 --> 00:26:06,894
It’s possible through Sahaja Yoga if you can
take your Kundalini beyond Agnya chakra.

160
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:12,480
By not reacting! Reaction is the worst
thing,

161
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:18,503
because reaction comes through your Agnya,
as I told you the other day,

162
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:27,298
and it is due to your conditioning or due
to your ego.

163
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:32,355
So some people react because of their
conditioning,

164
00:26:32,556 --> 00:26:41,683
and some people react because of their ego.
So why should you react to anything?

165
00:26:41,884 --> 00:26:46,589
Why don’t you enjoy – by not reacting.
You just watch.

166
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:53,823
See how beautifully they have made
beautiful flowers – just enjoy it.

167
00:26:54,024 --> 00:26:58,284
What is the need – some will find some
faults, somebody will say

168
00:26:58,485 --> 00:27:01,423
this should not have been there, how did
they manage this,

169
00:27:01,624 --> 00:27:09,026
all kinds of nonsensical things. The joy
of its creation is there.

170
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:14,612
And you should be able to see it, feel it,
enjoy it.

171
00:27:14,813 --> 00:27:19,891
Then you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise
you are not.

172
00:27:20,092 --> 00:27:25,986
If you are a reacting type, you cannot be
a Sahaja Yogi.

173
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:30,494
This is a degree – Sahaja Yoga is –

174
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:36,782
I think there are so many various styles
of Sahaja Yogis.

175
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:44,097
Somebody is just minor, somebody a little
plus, somebody’s like that.

176
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:50,009
But the depth of the Sahaja Yogi is

177
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:55,894
to be measured by the way he keeps joyous
and happy.

178
00:27:56,095 --> 00:28:01,097
Goes on criticizing others, go on getting
angry with others,

179
00:28:01,298 --> 00:28:06,149
all these things are going on, and he
thinks he’s a Sahaja Yogi.

180
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:13,940
In our Divine University we have no
degrees, we don’t give you certificates,

181
00:28:14,142 --> 00:28:17,065
you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you have got
your Realization.

182
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:23,032
If the Kundalini has burst opened here –
it’s all right, you are a Sahaja Yogi.

183
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:29,765
But that Sahaja Yogi may not be a real
Sahaja Yogi.

184
00:28:29,966 --> 00:28:36,563
It only depends when you are joyous and you
are anxious

185
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:42,392
to give Realizations to others. You want
to share your Realization,

186
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:49,063
you just don’t want to keep it to yourself.
If that is not your condition,

187
00:28:49,264 --> 00:28:53,249
then you are still not a full Sahaja Yogi.

188
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,475
You should find out how many people you
have given Realization.

189
00:28:57,676 --> 00:29:03,704
It’s very important. Because next year, as
I’ve said, is a very important,

190
00:29:03,905 --> 00:29:09,234
very, very important year.

191
00:29:09,435 --> 00:29:19,728
In that year I would like to see all of you
going round and giving Realization.

192
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:26,925
While I’ve seen all these other false gurus
who are getting exposed one by one.

193
00:29:27,785 --> 00:29:35,837
If you see their attitude, anywhere you
meet them – once I was travelling

194
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:40,272
by plane and there was a lady sitting next
to Me, she was so hot.

195
00:29:40,473 --> 00:29:44,649
So I asked her, “What guru do you follow?”
So she told Me the name.

196
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:49,429
She said “He’s very good, this guru is
the best” … this and that.

197
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,993
Such heat coming from her body! I never
said anything,

198
00:29:54,194 --> 00:30:00,837
but I was amazed how this lady was proudly
talking about her guru

199
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:08,845
who is such a bad man – and without knowing
Me, I was just a stranger to her.

200
00:30:09,046 --> 00:30:13,038
But Sahaja Yogis don’t talk about it.

201
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:19,272
You should talk to your neighbors, you
should talk in your circle.

202
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:28,696
Like, we have in India so many customs when
we meet people:

203
00:30:28,897 --> 00:30:32,882
Like in India we do haldi kumkum
in Maharashtra.

204
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:37,883
They will never talk to those women who
come for haldi kumkum about Sahaja Yoga.

205
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:41,780
They won’t even have My photograph.

206
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:45,163
If they want, they can do it. But they
are -

207
00:30:45,364 --> 00:30:50,039
I don’t know what are they frightened
about. It’s a very good chance.

208
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:56,321
You have any dinner, you have any public
meeting, anything.

209
00:30:56,522 --> 00:31:00,624
They won’t talk about Sahaja Yoga.
It’s very surprising.

210
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,764
They don’t want to talk about Sahaja Yoga

211
00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:07,219
that, “We have got this through Sahaja
Yoga.”

212
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,946
So how will Sahaja Yoga spread?

213
00:31:11,147 --> 00:31:18,360
One has to understand you all should find
out how much responsible you have been

214
00:31:18,561 --> 00:31:23,532
for getting into Sahaja Yoga. Of course,
you are all protected,

215
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:33,289
you are all blessed, everyone has got
whatever they wanted. Most of them.

216
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:39,835
But how many of them are returning
this debt?

217
00:31:40,036 --> 00:31:45,539
How many are working to give Realization
to others?

218
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:55,196
This is a debt on you. But if your
attention is haphazard,

219
00:31:55,397 --> 00:32:04,061
if your attention is not clear, is not
nirmal,

220
00:32:04,262 --> 00:32:14,516
then you are involved into all kinds
of things like the tentacles of an octopus.

221
00:32:14,717 --> 00:32:17,249
You become like an octopus,

222
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:22,313
you go on getting attached to this,
attached to that, attached to that.

223
00:32:22,514 --> 00:32:30,764
You have to be a free bird. All these
attachments that you have

224
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:39,454
are going to take you nowhere. You should
be only attached to Sahaja Yoga

225
00:32:39,655 --> 00:32:45,202
and should be conscious that you have known
yourself.

226
00:32:45,403 --> 00:32:52,149
If you can just understand your value,
your level,

227
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:57,514
I can tell you – we can change the whole
world!

228
00:32:57,715 --> 00:33:01,286
We have such a good heritage in this
country;

229
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:05,194
we have such good culture in this country.

230
00:33:05,395 --> 00:33:11,373
I have seen the problems of America and
other places, we don’t have these problems.

231
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:16,551
At least they’re not so prevalent.

232
00:33:16,752 --> 00:33:21,669
But only the thing that we have to do

233
00:33:22,324 --> 00:33:26,264
is to know you are a Sahaja Yogi.

234
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:32,045
Like a tree – when it grows, it knows
it’s a tree.

235
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:38,256
It knows it has to produce roots, it has
not come up ‘like that’.

236
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:45,069
It has not been brought up just like
a stick, no.

237
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:52,545
It has to do something. In this world
everything has to do something.

238
00:33:52,746 --> 00:33:57,239
But then what about Sahaja Yogis? It’s such
a rare thing to happen

239
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,748
that you have got your Realization. So
where should we waste our attention?

240
00:34:02,949 --> 00:34:10,014
Why should we neglect our meditation? Why?
We have to grow, we are a different people.

241
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:16,075
We are a different race altogether in this
world. We are realized souls.

242
00:34:16,276 --> 00:34:22,615
There were hardly any number during
the time of Christ, practically nil.

243
00:34:22,816 --> 00:34:28,895
And even before that I was surprised that
in China and other places,

244
00:34:29,096 --> 00:34:36,879
in one age there used to be one guru – one
master. While you are so many masters,

245
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,825
but you don’t want to use your power
as a master.

246
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:46,850
Why not the women use it also? I find women
are more lethargic

247
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:51,691
than men are in Sahaja Yoga. They should
show – I am a woman Myself,

248
00:34:51,892 --> 00:34:56,106
single-handed I’ve done all this work;
and why shouldn’t you do it?

249
00:34:56,307 --> 00:35:02,319
Because it’s a tremendous task to transform
people all over the world.

250
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,959
But it’s very easy for you – if I can
do it, why can’t you do it?

251
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:17,686
But put your complete attention to it that:
‘We are going to work out Sahaja Yoga,

252
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:21,967
not for ourselves, but for the betterment
of humanity.’

253
00:35:22,168 --> 00:35:27,044
We need it, we need it very much.

254
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:33,537
Your compassion, your love, is all being
wasted

255
00:35:33,738 --> 00:35:39,606
if you just think about yourself,
your family – what’s the use?

256
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:43,686
People do that even before Realization.

257
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:50,403
So what is the use of completely getting
attached to your families,

258
00:35:50,604 --> 00:35:56,458
attached to all other things? You should
get attached to the whole world!

259
00:35:56,659 --> 00:36:02,239
You belong to the whole world now, you are
no more individualistic.

260
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,780
No more! Now, as I said, it’s a drop
has become the ocean.

261
00:36:08,981 --> 00:36:16,256
Identify yourself with the ocean. Ocean is
the lowest, if you have seen,

262
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:22,356
lowest so much that the zero point starts
from the ocean.

263
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:28,756
Ocean is so humble. It’s the lowest point –
it lives,

264
00:36:28,957 --> 00:36:32,606
but all the rivers flow into it.

265
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:39,850
And the ocean does the work of throwing
clouds in the sky.

266
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:48,098
And these then burst and become rain
falling to the same ocean.

267
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:54,463
They come back to the same ocean. So those
who are humble

268
00:36:54,664 --> 00:36:58,293
will attract more Sahaja Yogis.

269
00:36:58,494 --> 00:37:03,309
Those who are kind will attract much more
Sahaja Yogis.

270
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:08,660
So it is important to see that you change
your temperament.

271
00:37:08,861 --> 00:37:14,651
If you try to show off, nobody is going
to be impressed by you.

272
00:37:16,682 --> 00:37:23,746
If you think you are something very great,
nobody is going to look at you.

273
00:37:23,947 --> 00:37:33,691
Be very humble, kind, generous – also very
joyous person.

274
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:38,323
Now imagine a Sahaja Yogi going in a group
and telling them,

275
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:45,237
“See, my mother is sick, my father is dying
and this thing is happening,

276
00:37:45,438 --> 00:37:53,223
but I am doing Sahaja Yoga.” So people will
say, “Why do you do Sahaja Yoga then?

277
00:37:53,424 --> 00:37:57,465
You go and cry and weep and sit down
there!”

278
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:05,512
If he’s really doing the Sahaja Yoga, no
sickness can come, no trouble can come.

279
00:38:05,713 --> 00:38:10,971
It is a fact. Try to understand.

280
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:17,973
With you only these people who are
supposed to be there, they will rise.

281
00:38:18,174 --> 00:38:24,284
But no use having identification with
people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

282
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:27,846
They may be your relations, they may be
anything. No use,

283
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:31,643
because you are at a different level, they
are at a different level.

284
00:38:31,844 --> 00:38:37,160
Either try to raise their level, or have
nothing to do with them,

285
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:42,816
because they will pull you down. They will
not see your height,

286
00:38:43,017 --> 00:38:49,151
they have no eyes to see, they have no ear
to hear,

287
00:38:49,352 --> 00:38:55,816
and they have no feelings of any kind.
If they have seen how you are changed,

288
00:38:56,017 --> 00:39:03,550
how your life is changed, they would have
gone absolutely head-long into Sahaja Yoga.

289
00:39:03,751 --> 00:39:09,395
But if they are not, that’s not your job.
You shouldn’t bother about them.

290
00:39:09,596 --> 00:39:13,965
If they come to Sahaja Yoga, well and good,
otherwise they are no your relations.

291
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:18,814
In no way they are related to you. How will
you relate Sahaja Yoga to them?

292
00:39:19,015 --> 00:39:22,995
How will you explain anything to them?
It’s going to be impossible

293
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:26,033
to talk to these people.

294
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:32,926
So what I have to tell you today is that
our family which is Sahaja Yoga,

295
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:40,035
is large, it’s spread in 86 countries, and
it’s doing very well.

296
00:39:40,236 --> 00:39:44,909
But what we have to see – that you do
belong to that ocean,

297
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:49,254
to the great families of Sahaja Yoga.

298
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:55,533
But it is for you to increase the size
of this.

299
00:39:55,744 --> 00:40:01,512
You have to increase, you have to talk
about it, and you have to change people.

300
00:40:01,713 --> 00:40:10,816
This is your responsibility. You were not
given Sahaja Yoga just for nothing,

301
00:40:11,017 --> 00:40:17,207
you have to produce greater Sahaja Yogis,
better Sahaja Yogis;

302
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:22,393
and you yourself meditate, not only
meditate

303
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:28,473
but also attend all the collective programs
as far as possible.

304
00:40:28,674 --> 00:40:33,955
I am happy the way you have stayed on and
have come here.

305
00:40:34,156 --> 00:40:42,941
It has rained – still you are here and you
still are enjoying the Divine bliss.

306
00:40:43,142 --> 00:40:49,018
I again and again bless you from my heart,
and I want you to have

307
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:54,332
that Shuddha Iccha which is the Kundalini,

308
00:40:54,533 --> 00:41:02,574
want you to have that Shuddha Iccha that is
the pure desire,

309
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:08,926
not only to become Sahaja Yogis but
to create more Sahaja Yogis.

310
00:41:09,127 --> 00:41:15,025
That is actually your pure desire. You may
not have recognized it,

311
00:41:15,226 --> 00:41:21,035
but unless and until you fulfill that
desire,

312
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:25,822
you can never be a good Sahaja Yogi.
It’s to spread Sahaja Yoga

313
00:41:26,023 --> 00:41:33,713
in every level, in everywhere, with every
one – that you can do it.

314
00:41:33,914 --> 00:41:39,223
And it will spread very well, and so many
people can be saved.

315
00:41:39,424 --> 00:41:45,582
So many people who are just lost
in the maya of stupidity

316
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:48,682
will be back on the right path.

317
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:53,457
How much good you are going to do for them
you just think.

318
00:41:53,658 --> 00:41:57,939
If Me alone has brought so many Sahaja
Yogis,

319
00:41:58,142 --> 00:42:05,410
why can’t you also try and get more Sahaja
Yogis? This world needs Sahaja Yoga.

320
00:42:05,611 --> 00:42:09,301
The whole problem – whenever I see
newspaper, I think, ‘Oh God,

321
00:42:09,502 --> 00:42:13,457
if these people were Sahaja Yogis, there
would have been no problem’.

322
00:42:13,658 --> 00:42:19,455
But I find that still people are roaming
about, and going round and round,

323
00:42:19,656 --> 00:42:25,260
I don’t know, as if they have no brains or
they’ve no understanding

324
00:42:25,468 --> 00:42:31,540
that ‘where is this world going?’ and
‘Who’s going to save this world?’

325
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:38,549
I am not here to tell you what you should
do in your private life.

326
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,867
But you yourself should know to keep
yourself cleansed

327
00:42:43,068 --> 00:42:46,586
and beautiful, what you have to do
to yourself.

328
00:42:46,787 --> 00:42:51,244
Some people are so superficial that it
doesn’t go into their heads.

329
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:54,838
Sahaja Yoga just doesn’t go into their
heads – very, very superficial.

330
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:00,150
So forget them. I don’t think they can
be saved. So forget them,

331
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:04,723
they cannot enjoy. They are worried about
some nonsensical things always.

332
00:43:04,924 --> 00:43:09,908
So with such people you need not – but
there are still so many people,

333
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:17,308
at least I think 80% people, who are
seeking and you should give them help.

334
00:43:17,509 --> 00:43:20,919
This is one thing, is the desire of your
Mother

335
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,866
that you should now take up Sahaja Yoga
upon yourself

336
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:28,950
and go on telling about this to everyone
who comes.

337
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:38,111
I mean I don’t want cheap popularity, but I
do want Sahaja Yogis to be made everywhere.
