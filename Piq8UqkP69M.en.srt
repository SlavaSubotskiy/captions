1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,200
I am happy that you all have adjusted yourselves

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,440
in this small space.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,520
When there is love and understanding,

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,840
little space can occupy many hearts.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,120
But, when there is no large heart

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:33,120
then whatever one may get is never sufficient.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,480
Today, we are going to worship Shiva Tattva within us,

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,200
principle of Shiva.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,200
For all Sahaja Yogis it's very important,

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,960
because Shiva is the ultimate we have to achieve.

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,600
Shiva is represented in our Spirit,

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:07,040
so to become Shiva is the ultimate aim of everything else.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,120
The rest of it is all created,

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:20,360
like Vishnu Tattva and Brahmadeva,

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,280
just to create human beings, to evolve them

16
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:32,520
and then ultimately lead them to Shiva.

17
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,040
That's the ultimate.

18
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:47,760
But human beings get so involved into the Brahmadeva's Tattva

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,560
that even to get into Vishnu Tattva is difficult.

20
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,440
They get involved into the five elements which have created

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,200
that is the outermost being within us.

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:13,440
All the chakras have the outermost, we can say just the vessel,

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:21,600
but the desire to be the spirit

24
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,440
is of primal importance in Sahaja Yoga.

25
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:35,440
So we have to see inward towards ourselves as Sahaja Yogis,

26
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,360
do we have that desire entirely?

27
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:48,080
Or we have still many desires hanging around?

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,040
See the greatest problem is of the Nabhi chakra,

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,320
whether it is in the East or the West.

30
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:07,320
Some people still have hankering for the baser search of food,

31
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,680
which is very surprising, even in Sahaja Yoga,

32
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,200
of nabhi chakra.

33
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,640
Then, still some people have sense of possessions and money quite a lot.

34
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,520
And subtler and subtler they grow,

35
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,640
still the detachment doesn't develop within them.

36
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,480
It becomes subtler. As you grow subtler,

37
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,400
the attachment becomes subtler and difficult to get out,

38
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,240
specially people who come up as leaders in Sahaja Yoga

39
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,440
or closer to Sahaja Yoga

40
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,600
are always under attack.

41
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,560
They are attacked

42
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,120
maybe by their husbands, wives,

43
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,800
brothers, sisters, sons, children, something like that.

44
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:14,920
And that makes it worse

45
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,800
because all such leaders who are attacked

46
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:29,280
try to displease all the deities by small things here and there.

47
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,600
The whole behaviour has to be understood

48
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,880
that you have become a subtler person

49
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,080
and you are rising higher,

50
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,280
so naturally the negative forces are going to attack you.

51
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,720
Always the front line is under attack,

52
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,400
not the back line.

53
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,160
So those who are in the front are always under attack

54
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,520
and they have to be very careful

55
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,120
as to how they are behaving.

56
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,280
For if there is a sly person,

57
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,080
he will become sly, but subtler sly.

58
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,000
He will not just become the other way round.

59
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,320
His slyness will become subtler.

60
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:21,160
If he is a miserly fellow, then he will become miserly in a subtler way.

61
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,680
Or say, if he is an ego-oriented fellow,

62
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,080
then he becomes ego-oriented in a subtler way.

63
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:34,040
But to get rid of these things within you,

64
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,560
you have to go to the other side of it.

65
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,720
Say if you are miserly, you become absolutely generous,

66
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,440
give up everything that you have.

67
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Don't be calculating,

68
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,800
don't talk of money, don't worry about money.

69
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,520
If you are extravagant, indulgent too much,

70
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,400
you should go the other way round.

71
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,920
Unless and until you become juxtaposition,

72
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,480
you cannot get rid of these things.

73
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,360
Like if you are hot-tempered man, very hot-tempered,

74
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,560
then become so mild

75
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,280
that even if somebody beats you, it's all right.

76
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,560
Whatever one says it's all right.

77
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,040
That's how you get rid of your habits

78
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,400
which become subtler and subtler.

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,320
There's another way of dealing with it, being alert.

80
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,720
When you are alert, you start seeing yourself

81
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,320
as a separate person with the habits that it has,

82
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,840
and then you start understanding why you are behaving.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,720
Oh I understand, I knew you before,

84
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,000
ten years back, before my realization.

85
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,120
I know mister, you are like this,

86
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,040
and then take the juxtaposition against that personality

87
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,080
and just shoot it off.

88
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,800
Like a person who is a negative, left-sided person.

89
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,320
Whatever you may do for that person,

90
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,240
he will become subtler and subtler.

91
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,600
Suddenly, if it's a girl,

92
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,680
she will start just crying for nothing at all and feeling miserable.

93
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,480
If it's a boy, if he thinks about, analyses

94
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:17,200
he will become analyzer of Sahaja Yoga, in a subtler way.

95
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,000
Then what they should do is to stand before the photograph

96
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,840
and see the reflection, that's the other one who died.

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,080
And just try to make fun of that

98
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,720
or shout at it, depends on.

99
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,360
If it is an aggressive stuff,

100
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,560
it's better to make fun, because it's stupid.

101
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,040
And if it is the one who takes aggression, then shout at it,

102
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,040
what do you mean, by taking aggression like this.

103
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,720
All these things, you see, are keeping you away from reality.

104
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,560
Your being has to be cleansed.

105
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,560
With your help only I can do it.

106
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,800
Many people say, "Mother, You are all powerful."

107
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,480
All right, I am and I can do everything.

108
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,080
But only thing I cannot surpass 'your' freedom. That's a fact.

109
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,720
I cannot cross over your freedom.

110
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:24,120
And when I cannot cross your freedom, 'you' have to cross that.

111
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,840
If in your own freedom, you come inside,

112
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,840
then I will bestow upon you all the blessings.

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,160
But if you want to stand outside

114
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,800
I am not the one to put you inside with a pistol.

115
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,440
No, that's not the way it will work out.

116
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,160
This is one hurdle that Sahaja Yogis must know

117
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,480
that at every moment you are free, and freer, and freest.

118
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,840
The more free you become, the worse is your situation

119
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,000
as far as the facing of the negativity is concerned.

120
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,040
Say there are four persons around you.

121
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,920
They will be first attacked.

122
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,000
Naturally you can understand the front line is always under attack,

123
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,040
not the back side.

124
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,840
Though according to the law, it should be the back side

125
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,800
because all these horrible

126
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,160
negative forces should come from the back.

127
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,000
But they are very clever.

128
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,560
They know that the back sometimes

129
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,240
drop off by themselves;

130
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,000
there is no need to go that side.

131
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,960
They try the front line.

132
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,520
And those who think they are in charge and responsible

133
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,320
have to be very careful as to how they behave,

134
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,840
how they are responsible, how they work it out.

135
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,120
If they are keeping their old habits

136
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,200
at a subtler level or they are just fighting it.

137
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,800
It's very important.

138
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,640
And this is how intelligently you can manage yourselves.

139
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,200
Then once you become detached,

140
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,040
go from all these things, only at mental level.

141
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,080
The spiritual level I'll look after you.

142
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,560
At mental level, you must come to logical conclusion that

143
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,280
"I have to fight this nonsensical stuff.

144
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,600
I have to be alert about this nonsense that exists within me."

145
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,680
Shiva Tattva is innocent, absolutely innocent it is.

146
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,040
It is very powerful and extremely innocent.

147
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,840
And the secret to achieve it is only just to please, just please.

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,360
If you please Shiva, then you may be a rakshasa or anything,

149
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,160
He grants all kinds of boons.

150
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,040
But to a rakshasa He can only grant

151
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,040
the boon of longevity, of long life.

152
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:05,840
But to a saint, He'll grant the Satchitananda state.

153
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,560
So even if He grants anything to a rakshasa,

154
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,560
one should not ask questions about it.

155
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,480
He can give you longevity - what does it matter,

156
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,400
even if he lives for thousands of years and earn nothing out of it;

157
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,400
he'll never get your realization.

158
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:32,760
So to a saint, He gives that eternal longevity

159
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,440
which comes through Spirit.

160
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,560
This is the blessing of Shiva Tattva.

161
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:54,560
While Vishnu Tattva, He gives ascent to a saint

162
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,400
and light of wisdom to see

163
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:07,440
and understand everything in collective consciousness

164
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:16,160
and to a rakshasa He gives death, He kills.

165
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:25,600
So for people who are not so deep,

166
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,200
it seems that why should Shiva give any blessings of longevity

167
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,400
to a rakshasa.

168
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:42,200
These are the characters of these different deities.

169
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:50,720
Now for example, if a rakshasa wants to live long,

170
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,520
he goes to Shiva, pleases Him

171
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:01,160
by praising Him, singing songs to Him, by asking His blessings,

172
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,400
by doing tapas for Him, talking about Shiva's innocence

173
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,840
he gets longevity.

174
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,320
Sometimes,

175
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,960
these rakshasas are better on the earth than in the subconscious.

176
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,160
They can be horrid.

177
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,760
They can gather some more bhoots

178
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,280
to torture human beings.

179
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,520
So it's better to keep them in the eyes of Vishnu.

180
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:37,600
He manages them better here than to send them into the subconscious.

181
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,360
But Shiva's style is very different from that of Vishnu's style.

182
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,160
You have to have all kinds of styles

183
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,320
because you know there are so many permutations and combinations

184
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,840
in human beings.

185
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,440
If you have one style,

186
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,640
what will you do with the other style of human beings?

187
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,840
So the style of Vishnu is

188
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,680
that if you are trying to be funny,

189
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,080
He plays tricks and puts you right.

190
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,800
Say, a Sahaja Yogi

191
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,240
He is not interested - Vishnu - so much interested in other people,

192
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,600
but in Sahaja Yogis. If Sahaja Yogi tries to be funny;

193
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,680
say he wants to drink wine, all right, He says, "Drink wine."

194
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,800
He drinks the wine, and then he gets sick somewhere,

195
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,680
his cars falls off, or he is insulted somewhere.

196
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,840
Something happens to him, he is punished so badly

197
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,640
that he says, "Oh God, what have I done?" That's Vishnu tattva.

198
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,120
But Shiva is the other way round.

199
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,040
If you see Shiva's style is this; that if you drink,

200
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,320
He just disappears from your heart.

201
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,080
You have a heart attack and you die.

202
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,680
He also kills.

203
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,400
One kills directly in a positive way, He definitely kills;

204
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,640
the another one by recession.

205
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,760
If Shiva disappears, how can you exist,

206
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,280
that's one way. Second way is that,

207
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,680
those who are born with Shiva tattva

208
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,520
like our Sainath was - Shirdi Sainath,

209
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,960
or people like that;

210
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,720
even the Devis sometimes can do that.

211
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,680
They drink away all the wines of the world, all the poisons of the world.

212
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,680
Like Shiva did that.

213
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,920
So when Sainath found that so many people were smoking

214
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,720
this tobacco,

215
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,800
he smoked all the tobacco of the world.

216
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,120
He tried to smoke everything in Maharashtra

217
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,400
so that nobody should get it.

218
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,800
That's the style of Shiva to take all the poison into Himself.

219
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,320
And to absorb all the poison within Himself.

220
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,240
He can deal with the most difficult things;

221
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,240
so the one dealing comes through the brain.

222
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,520
Because Virata is in our brain, acts through the brain.

223
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,240
So He plays tricks on you.

224
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,840
And that appeals to us because we can see that He's killed someone.

225
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,560
So we think 'very nice Mother, You have punished that person'.

226
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,800
But Shiva Tattva gives you the problems

227
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,000
which normally you cannot see,

228
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,560
but works out in a short time like that.

229
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,480
Like heart troubles

230
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,640
or a person who has a very poor Shiva Tattva

231
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,640
can have all the incurable diseases of the world.

232
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,480
There nobody is killed, but every minute the person is suffering.

233
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,560
That is the way Shiva corrects.

234
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,400
In us when Shiva Tattva is awakened

235
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,240
our priorities change absolutely.

236
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,400
I see now that those who have come, say,

237
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,040
to India from the west

238
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,040
have changed quite a lot in their priorities, but still

239
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,840
there is not so much change as it should be.

240
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,120
They're of course thousand times better

241
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,840
than their fellow beings who are not realized souls.

242
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:38,440
But still, attachment to things, attachment to money is quite a lot.

243
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,800
This detachment must work out.

244
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,800
See things are not correct in people and the alertness is not there.

245
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,480
To give a very, very gross example of this, I will tell you that,

246
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,120
a gentleman, say, came and he was told that you have to give,

247
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,040
say, eleven rupees for puja. He said,

248
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,640
"On principle we are not supposed to give."

249
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,840
So I mean, you are only paying even on principle

250
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,320
you are only paying for your food and lodging, not for puja.

251
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,840
The other side of it they will not even see

252
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,720
that Mother is spending so much for us extra

253
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
for which we are not paying.

254
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,320
It's not all found. Like the other day, I said

255
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,080
that people are now asking Me to pay for this,

256
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,200
then tomorrow they will say pay for our house rents. It was so.

257
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,840
It was such a condition, once upon a time in London when I started the ashram.

258
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That they asked for all the utensils in the ashram,

259
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,120
I paid for the rent, paid for everything.

260
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,920
Ultimately they said we don't have an ironing board, please send us.

261
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,400
From that, it's not so bad now, I mean, of course.

262
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,360
But still, if they have to pay 5 rupees for taxi,

263
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,680
they will think that, "Oh we have to pay for taxi - Mother is supposed to pay."

264
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,000
But if I pay

265
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,720
7000- 8000 rupees for you to go to Haridwar, that's all right.

266
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,680
That's good. That nobody wants to find out, how Mother is paying for us.

267
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,320
how Mother is paying for us.

268
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,520
It's surprising and this disturbs Me very much

269
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,880
that what is your attitude towards that.

270
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,320
The pleasing should be done with full heart.

271
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,680
Say if you have to buy any presents for your friends, or anything,

272
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,320
you don't mind spending money for that.

273
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,640
But for puja you have objections.

274
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,920
For your laundry you used to pay always, I mean

275
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,400
I have seen the laundry bill, I was amazed how much money was spent.

276
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,720
But 21 Rupees, the principle was involved,

277
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,280
imagine. Look at it.

278
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,360
If you look at it, you will be shocked at yourselves.

279
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,040
That shows despite all this, you have got your realization.

280
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,400
See the generosity. It's very, very - you see, it's very gross.

281
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,520
It's very gross.

282
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:22,520
So the detachment from this gross life must go away.

283
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,000
But an ordinary villager understands better because he is innocent.

284
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,400
He is innocent. Because you are not innocent.

285
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,920
That's why you see everything from your mind.

286
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,280
You think about it.

287
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,400
How much have we paid, how much this is, this that, this that.

288
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,680
But an innocent villager even if he has four annas,

289
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,880
he would like to do something,

290
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,920
"Mother - that's all I have."

291
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,840
We have a parable in the Bible.

292
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,120
And this is what it is. One should see our detachment starts

293
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,040
at a very baser level of money.

294
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,720
You need not have any friends,

295
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,080
what is the need to give  to any friends?

296
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,360
What are these friends for?

297
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,440
Except for Shiva Tattva, what other friend you need?

298
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:27,640
Think of it, without God, what is your life?

299
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,280
So the detachment must start. The priorities must change

300
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,800
and you must know that God is the One who is your Friend,

301
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,360
who is your Father, who is your Mother,

302
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,640
who is to be worshipped, there is nothing else.

303
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,160
Tana, mana, dhana, everything is for God.

304
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,440
Of course, I don't want anything from you, you know that.

305
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:54,120
But that should be the attitude of a person.

306
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,720
So the first - this attitude comes in a person.

307
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,280
Of course, in Sahaja Yoga, you have a great advantage

308
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,880
that those who have developed this attitude

309
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,040
have been helped so much materially

310
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,680
that you find the proof of it immediately.

311
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,520
The proof is there and those who do not take to this kind of a thing

312
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,840
suffer. So the proof is there.

313
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:39,480
I must give you an example of a - goldsmith.

314
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,280
I had given him something to be made for the Puja.

315
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,000
A lot of gold was given, everything.

316
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:52,760
And still, stupidly, he tried to make money out of that.

317
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,160
And he got cancer and he died.

318
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,960
I didn't do anything. But I knew he had made money, I knew that all.

319
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,760
I knew lots of things, I didn't say anything to him, nothing, never

320
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:16,720
never even mentioned. He got cancer and he died, he is no more.

321
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,000
Because Shiva Tattva disappeared.

322
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:26,400
This was for a puja, the money of the saints,

323
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,520
something was to be made and he should not have done it.

324
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,120
The proof is just there.

325
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,760
Now, those who knew him got a fright of their lives,

326
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,200
"Oh God, now no more of this from us at least."

327
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,800
But those who have been surrendered about their money part also,

328
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,160
not that I take anything from them nor I want anything from you.

329
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,560
But, still the attitude I am saying is different,

330
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,520
they have gone out, they have made money,

331
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,200
they are very rich, they are very well to do, they are all right.

332
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,120
They get so much blessings - everything.

333
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:14,920
This is the first Nabhi chakra. We should start by putting Shiva.

334
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,280
Every attachment can be attacked with Shiva Tattva

335
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,680
because Shiva Tattva is brilliant like a diamond, brilliant.

336
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,920
Every facet can be cleansed out, very simply

337
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,320
through our Kundalini awakening and through our alertness

338
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,760
and what after that you can see there are other attachments we have.

339
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:49,720
This is friendship, sympathies, friendships.

340
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,440
Sympathies always go to a person

341
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,960
who is in need or something like that.

342
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,640
You have no sympathies, have tortured so many people.

343
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,600
The other way also could be that you hate someone too much,

344
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,560
you love someone too much, some sort of a thing like that.

345
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:14,480
So detachment comes that you do not hate nor you love anyone.

346
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,400
You leave it to God.

347
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,400
That's the kind of a detachment that you leave it to God.

348
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,360
God, please that's His decision. I am not going to judge.

349
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,120
Only thing I judge them on Kundalini and I awaken their kundalini.

350
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,960
If it works out well and good, if it doesn't work out, all right.

351
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,520
So we have detached yourselves,

352
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,200
from the responsibility of judging others.

353
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,280
Only your judgment is on Kundalini, if it works out, all right.

354
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,160
But, you are just like a barometer that's all,

355
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,800
or like a machine that cures. You are not involved into it.

356
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,040
So this involvement into personal lives and personal relationships

357
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,000
like mother, sister, brother every sort of a nonsense

358
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,000
must be taken up.

359
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,920
Now say, if your mother is not all right,

360
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,480
you must just get after her and see that she is put right.

361
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,680
That's very important; mother has to be all right.

362
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
If she's not all right,

363
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,080
then you tell her, "I'm not going to eat food from your hand", finished.

364
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,040
You get your vibrations, all right.

365
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,720
You tell her that "You better take to realization otherwise

366
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,200
I will not have anything to do with you. I'm just going to see,

367
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,360
talk to you and go away."

368
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,080
Show that detachment to her. Be strong.

369
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,160
You must cure your mother. Very important

370
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,560
because mother is a part of Sahaja Yoga,

371
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,800
it's very important. But many people I have seen

372
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,320
just do not know how to resist. You must protest;

373
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,000
go on protesting one after another

374
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,040
because that's the greatest thing you are doing for your mother.

375
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,280
What else can you give it to her?

376
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,120
Anything you give the whole world has no meaning

377
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,120
except correcting your mother for a better life,

378
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,640
an eternal life, life of God.

379
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,560
Then your wife

380
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,960
your wife is a very dangerous situation.

381
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,840
If your wife is negative, she will go on

382
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,240
putting into your head things which will work out at a odd time

383
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,160
and you will be amazed how you slipped out

384
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,080
these things and how you said these things.

385
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,600
Why should you have done it

386
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,800
why did you do this.

387
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,960
But the wife is to be told that,

388
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,160
"You have to behave yourself; you have to get all right,

389
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,040
nothing doing. And there is no compromise.

390
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
You be in another room, I will be in another room.

391
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,240
You should get well. I am not going to help."

392
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,160
Because that is even much more dangerous

393
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,720
because you know if the woman is catching

394
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:04,720
then there are very serious diseases developed in the Mooladhara.

395
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,760
So you have to be strict with your wife.

396
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,080
You should make her, you should tell her,

397
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,840
"I'll not eat any food with your hands.

398
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,160
I'll have nothing to do, I'll not talk to you,

399
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,080
I'll just come and sleep in another room.

400
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,360
You better not touch my clothes.

401
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,600
If you don't listen to me then I have nothing to do with you

402
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,200
or better I'm your husband.

403
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,560
Whatever dharma I follow you have to follow me,

404
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,240
if you don't want to listen to me,

405
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,840
then I have nothing to do with you."

406
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,800
The wife can also do the same with the husband.

407
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,360
Gradually showing indifference

408
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,520
in a way that he understands that it doesn't bring love.

409
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,520
That's how women corrected men long time back.

410
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,320
Nowadays, of course women, if you give them something,

411
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,520
they are get pleased.

412
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,960
Even if there is a keep,

413
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,600
as long as they are giving diamonds to the wife

414
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,240
she is quite pleased with the keep.

415
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,520
Still in India it's not accepted.

416
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,000
But I have seen in the west nobody minds,

417
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,280
if the husband has ten keeps doesn't matter

418
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,160
as long as he is giving you the money, all right, nobody minds it.

419
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,040
That's very funny.

420
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,960
So wife's relation, mother's relation, husband's relations,

421
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,880
close relations must be corrected.

422
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,240
Now children must be guarded.

423
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,320
You shouldn't allow your children to go away to the wrong things.

424
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,080
If they are doing wrong things, they are not coming to Sahaja Yoga,

425
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,640
you are duty bound;

426
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,120
you should say, I'm not going to pay you any money, nothing doing.

427
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,320
I'll not see your faces, if you do not take to Sahaja Yoga.

428
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,200
What else are you going to give to your children, but God?

429
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,600
You can do it. All can do it.

430
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:06,040
But one should know 'I' need not do it.

431
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,320
So many people say

432
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,800
that, "Mother, Your husband is not so much a Sahaja Yogi."

433
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,840
It's all right. I know where to bring him in;

434
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,240
I know when to bring My children in;

435
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,000
because if they were in everybody would have said,

436
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,360
"They have floated a family enterprise."

437
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,240
As long as they are out of it, it's a very good idea

438
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,000
specially in India.

439
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,280
So best thing is if they oppose Me, I keep all of them out,

440
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,560
My brothers. Imagine My own brothers, My own - I mean,

441
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,600
they all have tremendous respect for Me, no doubt.

442
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,120
Even My brothers said that

443
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,720
Thank God You are staying in my room now,

444
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,800
so the vibrations will be very good for me.

445
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,480
What do You think of my vibrations?"

446
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,400
Everything he says, but he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

447
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,080
I have given realization to all of them, everything is there,

448
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,440
but they are not Sahaja Yogis - apart of this.

449
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,080
Otherwise they will be in charge of money, you see.

450
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,160
What money you get. Now come along

451
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,760
this is the money we have, all problems.

452
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,360
With all these relations around, you don't know.

453
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,800
Somebody will go and say, "Shri Mataji said so."

454
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,960
"Oh, that's the daughter of Mataji  has said so." - That becomes so.

455
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,160
I don't want all these pressures on My head.

456
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,280
That's the best way; I wish our politicians understand that;

457
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,040
never have your relations around.

458
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,880
That's the best way to administer.

459
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,440
If you have your relations around,

460
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,720
then you will never do right things.

461
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,760
Or even if you do right things, your relations will spoil it.

462
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,040
So all those who are Sahaja Yogis must know

463
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,880
that you should not try to help your relations

464
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,920
in a way that they take advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

465
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,000
Like, if you are a Sahaja Yogi,

466
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,400
then you bring your mother and make her sit in front of Me.

467
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,040
First correct her vibrations,

468
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,560
put her right and then bring her.

469
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,000
Correct my father, correct my mother is not Mother's responsibility,

470
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,400
it's your own.

471
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,960
When they are all right, then as you bring flowers to Me,

472
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:40,160
bring your relations as a very good present from your family.

473
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,800
That's a much better thing than to be like this that

474
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,160
I have to clear. If one is a Sahaja Yogi,

475
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,640
all his three generations up and down,

476
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,600
this side and that side have to cure that is done.

477
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,720
Like Malhotra made Me do.

478
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,360
So one should detach from these family ties

479
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,680
and these emotional imbalances we have, emotional problems we have

480
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,160
by understanding that the only thing that these people should have

481
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,280
is Sahaja Yoga.

482
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,200
And some people should not be in Sahaja Yoga

483
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,040
like as I said - My own husband, and My daughter and My relations,

484
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,080
I'll keep them out.

485
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,160
All such people if there are any,

486
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,560
you should not also have them anywhere near Sahaja Yoga.

487
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,680
You should be discrete to find out.

488
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,440
Although, all these, My relations are very dharmic people,

489
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,960
extremely dharmic, very good.

490
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,120
Very self-respecting, all qualities they have got - everything.

491
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,680
Ready made, but they are not in Sahaja Yoga.

492
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,960
So none of you can say so-body said so, so one said so.

493
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,480
It has to be Mother has to say.

494
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,840
This detachment has to come, it takes time.

495
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,120
Especially with Indians,

496
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,560
all the time they are worried about their children, mother or father

497
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,400
on and on and on and on and on.

498
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,600
See years together, my son, my daughter, my son, my father –

499
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,640
all the time.

500
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,600
Now by God's grace

501
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,520
so many have got rid of all their responsibilities somehow,

502
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,600
through Sahaja Yoga, or whatever it is,

503
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,160
so they are now they have settled down with themselves,

504
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,880
because you have your own responsibility.

505
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,960
So this detachment must be brought

506
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,240
those who are coming to Sahaja Yoga,

507
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,840
that we are here to get Sahaja Yoga blessings.

508
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,080
We are going to be blessings, with that pride.

509
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,720
You should be in the family, all right.

510
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,160
If you want to have Sahaja Yoga, you have it.

511
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,080
But not to force them on Sahaja Yoga,

512
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,760
but you can force Sahaja Yoga on them,

513
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,760
the stage has come that you have to talk about Sahaja Yoga to them.

514
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,200
In the beginning I used to say, "Don't talk to them."

515
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,720
But those who are useless,

516
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,920
if they are not to be brought in Sahaja Yoga,

517
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,000
tell them, "You are not good for Sahaja Yoga, better not ask."

518
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,000
Then they will come.

519
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,320
Some people you should show complete indifference,

520
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,000
"you are incapable, you are no good, you are too materialistic."

521
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,880
Then that person would say, "I will prove that I am"

522
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,600
All these detachments take place

523
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,400
and then the detachments are at Nabhi chakras,

524
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,000
will rise up to your emotional side in your Heart chakra.

525
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:47,680
And then you have to have the detachment even of a

526
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,400
kind of a collectivity that we think is collectivity.

527
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:59,360
I call the fraternity of the bhoots, not collectivity.

528
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:06,160
Always all the useless Sahaja Yogis will form a group

529
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:13,960
and they will have a very strong objection

530
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,440
to everything that is sensible.

531
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,200
And they will have suggestions for everything.

532
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:27,000
There has to be no suggestions at all.

533
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,320
There are no alternatives, because Shiva is absolute.

534
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,800
Once what is said is said, you just do it and see - that's the best.

535
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:45,480
Alternatives will be second best or third best or maybe useless.

536
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,240
But there is no alternative for Shiva Tattva.

537
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,240
I'll give an example, I told Delhi people that you organise say,

538
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,680
program for seven days outside with other people.

539
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,160
It was sensible because I knew it was to rain. It has to rain also.

540
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,760
Rain can be stopped, but it was to rain for all the other villagers, you see.

541
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,600
We cannot stop it only for Sahaja Yogis.

542
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,560
Of course, Sahaja Yogis are important so I said,

543
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,360
"Let them be with other Sahaja Yogis."

544
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,920
Now they started an alternative, only thinking,

545
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,840
that you see they won't be comfortable. And I mean it was good,

546
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,600
but on a other level that they will not be comfortable

547
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,760
with Sahaja Yogis, another level.

548
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,480
But there has to be understanding if Mother has said it

549
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,440
it must be done - whatever it is.

550
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,080
Even if She says, "You kill somebody", you have to kill.

551
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,000
Keep it like that to that extent.

552
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,840
Keep to the maximum,

553
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,120
Even if She says, "You have to die", you should die.

554
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:59,040
If She says, "All  right, you tell lies."

555
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,040
Go on, "I'll tell lies."

556
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,840
Like Radhaji, She said, "What is my punyas, what is my papas.

557
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,760
I'm His wife. What can I do, whatever He tells Me."

558
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,680
That is Shiva Tattva.

559
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,120
When it is awakened you see it at least recognizes Shiva in Me.

560
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,880
And it sees that this is Shiva Tattva.

561
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,120
It understands because at Shiva Tattva you don't commit any sins,

562
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,400
you are sinless.

563
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,920
When you are the Spirit, you are sinless; there is no sin in you.

564
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,960
If, supposing according to human understanding

565
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,120
if Shiva leaves a person dies, then it's sinful. Why to leave anybody.

566
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,280
It's sinful, isn't it? For all common purposes,

567
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,920
common understanding will think that it is sinful for Shiva to leave

568
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,920
the person and make the person die.

569
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,560
For example, a lady dies, her children are left behind,

570
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,680
then one can blame Shiva for that

571
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,120
"See now You went away and these children are now without a mother

572
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,160
or without a father", or something like that.

573
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,160
Because Shiva is sinless; whatever He does is sinless.

574
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,560
So whatever you do is sinless

575
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:25,160
the idea of sin is finished because who commits sin is your ego.

576
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,280
Ego commits sin.

577
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,480
But if you have no ego, there's no sin

578
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,360
because you are not doing anything.

579
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,720
You stand in Akarma. Say the sun is shining and shining sharp

580
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,360
and somebody wants to stand in the sun then he gets burns.

581
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,360
It's not the fault of the sun, the sun is shining

582
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,480
that's the job of sun.

583
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,400
Whatever is the job of the Shiva, He is doing it. He's not sinful.

584
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,920
It's our mental attitude makes us think, this is sin, this is not sin.

585
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,800
But when we have ego, we are committing sins.

586
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,760
If you ask a tiger,

587
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,600
"You are committing a sin because you are eating a cow."

588
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,920
He will say, "I never knew what a sin was.

589
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,560
I don't know what sin is."

590
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,440
It's a story when some missionaries

591
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,480
were going away from a village, you see.

592
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,280
So the villagers - poor, innocent villagers, they got up to thank them.

593
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,880
They said, "Thank God, when you came here you told us there is sin.

594
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,680
We didn't know what sin was."

595
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,840
Innocent people, they don't know what is sin.

596
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,840
Because Spirit is innocent, it has no sin.

597
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,080
It obeys the other source of innocence.

598
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,480
So there is no sin for a person who is innocent.

599
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,840
For Shiva, there is no sin whether He wants to give

600
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,520
His blessings to a rakshasa

601
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:05,440
or to a saint. There is no sin for Him because He is bholenath.

602
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:12,920
He is beyond sin. Whatever He does, He is beyond sin

603
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,080
because ego cannot envelope Him. There is no ego.

604
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,960
Because we have ego we commit sins.

605
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,080
Once ego is finished we are no more there, so who commits sins?

606
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,680
When we are not there, who is committing the sin?

607
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,240
Shiva can't commit sins, so we are the Shiva

608
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,160
so we cannot commit sins.

609
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,320
So all these ideas of giving alternatives

610
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,720
at the mental level is also wrong.

611
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,160
I give - anything I say, immediately there will be ten suggestions.

612
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,280
I try all these tricks with you.

613
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:58,760
Because you are used to conferences, you see.

614
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,520
So I said, "All right, Subramanian, what do you have to say about it?"

615
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,480
Because after all, Lord Subramanian is there. Must ask him.

616
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:16,560
Then I ask Venugopalan, then I'll ask Maureen

617
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:21,320
all these people. Now what do you have to say?

618
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,320
And then they give their suggestions.

619
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:35,400
But if you see in the conference of all the Divine Deities,

620
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:42,080
there is no suggestion, no suggestion, no alternative.

621
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,760
No alternatives to your Mother's ideas, nothing.

622
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,000
Absolute. It's absolute. Nobody gives any suggestions to Me;

623
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:58,560
Never. No question.

624
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,080
They won't listen to you, they won't listen to anyone.

625
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:11,040
There's no question. Such harmony; complete obedience.

626
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,520
And not only they are fixed with their qualities.

627
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,040
They are told that you have to do it, they'll do it.

628
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,880
This is the difference.

629
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,560
They try. Sometimes it appears, you see.

630
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,000
If I say all right, go this way and you will find the place

631
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,400
but you won't find.

632
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,440
So then you will say, 'See Mother You said to go this

633
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,680
and that's why we went this way and we didn't find the church.'

634
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,600
Now there it is not that I'm saying that you will find the church,

635
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,920
it is I am trying to see what you think.

636
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,400
I am telling you My own tricks, all right, so be careful.

637
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:01,440
I'll tell you all, go this way, now you didn't find the church, I'm sorry.

638
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,520
I should not have told you. Or you shouldn't have gone that way.

639
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,160
But that's not true. I must tell you, that's not true.

640
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,600
What I'm trying to see what you are saying about this.

641
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,280
Now if you are clever, you would say,

642
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,200
"I went there, I didn't see the place, but I saw something else, Mother

643
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,200
that's the reason You sent me there. Now I know why You sent me there."

644
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,080
That's it. Then I know that he is Sahaja Yogi. But if you say:

645
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,680
"Oh I went there because I thought I will find this thing,"

646
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,120
"but, it was not there, and 'You' sent me, 'You' sent me"

647
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:41,800
Finished. If you say that, You said so and it happened

648
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,080
or I did say, no doubt. But what I said was just to play a trick on you.

649
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,160
Because one of the natures of your Mother is Mahamaya;

650
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,320
so be careful. How you react

651
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,480
is very important for Me to see how far you have gone.

652
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,440
This is one of the ways you are judged.

653
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:05,400
But for a villager, it's a different thing if you see.

654
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,320
If I tell him: "Now if you want Me

655
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,360
to go to that village, see, take the cart,

656
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,080
or take the bullock cart this way; we'll take it."

657
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,920
But there will be a ditch. So I'll get it.

658
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,280
So he will say, "Mother, I'm sorry, you got it.

659
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,160
I could have avoided it.

660
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,040
See. So he takes the responsibility upon himself.

661
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,920
He takes everything upon himself.

662
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,040
Because you asked Me so I had to go that way

663
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,360
but I could have avoided it if I was there careful.

664
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,560
So this is the difference you know, not to put the responsibility.

665
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,000
It's a common human nature is to put responsibility on somebody else.

666
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,520
Best is to put on Mother

667
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:59,480
But in that you lose all your punyas.

668
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,040
So the responsibility is mine, I must have done some mistake.

669
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,080
I must have done some mistake somewhere

670
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:13,280
or else maybe that Mother wants me to learn something in this.

671
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,120
Every time you do something, I tell you something,

672
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,040
it's just for you to learn something. I don't have to learn anything.

673
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,200
If you think that way that I have to learn something now you know.

674
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,200
So you have to learn something.

675
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,000
And that is what if you understand; then a kind of a detachment

676
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,800
will build in you and a surrender.

677
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,320
You will be amazed that you will be so much

678
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,320
relieved of nonsensical headaches

679
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,200
that you have and the burdens you carry.

680
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:50,320
If you understand that the whole joke,

681
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,040
the whole work, the whole drama is done by Mother

682
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,400
and I am just playing into it. It's so simple.

683
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:04,280
That is to be understood.

684
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,000
And the enjoyment lies in that.

685
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,080
Not in judging or finding alternatives.

686
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,560
You try it. Those who have tried it have enjoyed it very much.

687
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,000
And so many things. Every minute, I'll give you an example of that.

688
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,760
I'll give you an example of Gregoire

689
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,840
last time I went to his house.

690
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,480
He tortured My life for his wife.

691
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,280
When will she have her delivery, how will she have,

692
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,840
who is going to stay with her?

693
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,200
Morning till evening, he had one talk.

694
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,280
All right, I said, "Something will be done.

695
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,320
You can have this lady to stay with you."

696
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,560
And then, "How will I go to India?" I mean, "I" was so important.

697
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,480
Then he didn't realize it at that time,

698
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,800
he thought it was so important to do that.

699
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,920
Ultimately quite before going I told him,

700
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,480
"Gregoire, you troubled Me too much this time."

701
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,880
" But it's all right." Then he said, "I'm sorry."

702
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,360
Then he telephoned Me one day saying,

703
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,360
"Mother, my wife is in for abortion.

704
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,240
She has gone to the hospital, there is no chance." I said, "Forget it.

705
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,840
You go back to the hospital, she will be all right."

706
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,200
He went to the hospital and they said, "It's a miracle."

707
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:17,520
"She's perfectly all right, there's no problem. She's all right."

708
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,000
So it came into his head, as he told Me.

709
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,280
Oh, Mother is looking after it, why should I worry.

710
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,320
Why should I worry? This is first thing.

711
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:31,040
Then, the child was born earlier than time.

712
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,400
And he came to Me.

713
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,800
So also I convinced him, what I say

714
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,680
what I do, you know that.

715
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,680
That I look after you.

716
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,160
But when you take up responsibility upon yourself and start thinking about it,

717
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,360
then I cannot help.

718
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,560
So just know that leave it to God.

719
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,400
It's all for your good, for your 'hitha'

720
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,480
Everything is for your 'hitha'.

721
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:03,160
Whatever it is, sometimes I have to shout at you, sometimes I have to

722
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,440
correct you, sometimes I have to tell you that, "Don't come here."

723
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,680
Some people who touch Me, you see, can give me horrible sensations,

724
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,480
then I say, "You just don't come here. You don't stand before Me,

725
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,880
get out from here." That helps them.

726
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,320
But if they stand there, the bhoots will never leave

727
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,320
because the bhoots want to trouble Me.

728
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,960
So this point if you understand, you will get completely detached

729
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,800
and will know that for our good, for our betterment

730
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,000
we must keep Mother pleased and

731
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,800
these things if we do by displeasing Her,

732
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,880
we are going to be finished.

733
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,800
Now to understand this, what you need - not age, not position,

734
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:50,320
not your qualifications, nothing - you need a wise mind.

735
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,400
Deep personality.

736
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,560
I've seen very young people are so sensible

737
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,200
their parents are stupid, absolutely stupid people.

738
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,600
So you just need a wise, deep personality to do it

739
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,280
and that you should try to develop.

740
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,200
That comes only sticking onto Shiva tattva,

741
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:13,160
which is a solid thing, which is Shiva, Achara

742
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,840
which doesn't move, absolute.

743
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,920
It is not relative, it's not relative at all

744
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,880
it's not related to anything, absolute. That gives you the depth.

745
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:30,000
That depth which is required to settle down, to go deep.

746
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,800
Shiva is your guru. Guru is the one that gives you the gravity

747
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,680
to go straight down deep into it.

748
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,920
That is very important. And all this

749
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:01,040
I hope with the puja today

750
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,960
we'll try to settle you

751
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:09,640
into that great principle of Shiva.

752
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,680
Let your attention, every particle of your attention be filled,

753
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:29,360
sparkled and rejoice by that blessing of Shiva tattva.

754
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,000
I bless you all! May God bless you!

755
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:44,000
So to begin with, we are going to worship the Devi first of all,

756
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,520
and then the Shiva.

757
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,440
So first we will hav Ganesha's Avahanam

758
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,560
means we have to establish Shri Ganesha. That is important.

759
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:01,320
And then, after that we have to say the names of Vishnu,

760
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:05,040
whatever – because these names have to be said

761
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,720
which are the ascending names.

762
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,000
And after that

763
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:18,880
we will be having the location and everything described where we are doing it,

764
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,160
why we are doing it, the puja.

765
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,640
Then we’ll worship Devi.

766
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,080
We take 108 names of the Devi.

767
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,200
I think you all should remember these 108 names by heart.

768
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:36,120
Have you got it printed – the Devi’s names? Gavin?

769
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:42,800
Have you got copies? You have got them?

770
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,440
Have you got these with you? You have booklet?
