1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:02,759
Shri Mataji: All right, start it.

2
00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:05,649
[Warren Reeves gives an introduction of 8.5
minutes.]

3
00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:07,100
Shri Mataji: Good evening.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,180
Audience: Good evening.

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:15,180
Shri Mataji: Today is the last day, when I
have to go. And you can understand a mother

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,240
who has so many children, she has to go from
one to another; she has the expectation to

7
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:40,039
meet her children and she has the concern
and the longing for whom she has so much love.

8
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:59,780
That's very difficult to express those feelings:
like waves as if they are taking out something

9
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:08,909
from you.

10
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,909
I do not know really how to thank you all.
Without you I cannot enjoy anything. As I

11
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:25,049
told you, even I may be the Capitalist and
I may have all these powers, so-called, I'm

12
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:32,430
a complete Communist, I can't enjoy it alone.
I have to share it with you. At the very outset,

13
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:45,869
I would like to thank Mr. Sig Paulsen for
making it available for Me, this beautiful

14
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,320
church. And you all that I could manifest
My love, could have a rapport with you, whom

15
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:09,930
I have known before. I'm meeting you again,
thanks to him.

16
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:16,930
I have to thank Betty, specially. She has
been so earnest. She wrote to Me letters,

17
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:26,750
she telephoned to Me again and again. Oh,
she took so much trouble to see that I come

18
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:36,940
to Houston. She has made these four days,
fantastic visit for Me. You all have to thank

19
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:46,960
her for what she's done, it's a very, very
great thing that she thought of you all and

20
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:56,700
of sharing her joy with you all. She got her
realization in Australia. It's a chain of

21
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:05,910
thanking, for which I have to thank Doctor
Warren who came to India for his realization,

22
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:14,450
and I got stuck to him... He was running every
moment and he got his realization.

23
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,200
Then we have other people here from India.
Nirmala Modi has come all the way, she's a

24
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:33,200
very wise Sahaj yogini. And then we have Hugo,
you know he came all the way. Went to Japan

25
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:46,980
from Australia, bought these equipments and
he's come to New York, then to Houston. Think

26
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:56,530
of them, how much they feel responsible that
they should communicate truth to you and that

27
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:05,690
they should arrange this beautiful program.
Warren's wife has also come here. We have

28
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:15,400
also, another American, Michael, who is helping
a lot.

29
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,400
The best of all, I would say is one of my
eldest sons, is Mr Gavin Brown. Who had something

30
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:31,430
to do with Houston. And when I wanted him
to put some money for American tour, I don't

31
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:39,430
know why, he put it in Houston Bank. I said,
"Why Houston of all the things? I may never

32
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,570
go there."

33
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:48,100
He says, "No Mother, Houston is the place."
Still the money is lying in the Bank here,

34
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:55,100
for next years program perhaps. He has worked
very hard and he's going to stay on here.

35
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:03,460
He's a quiet person. But he knows a lot about
Sahaj Yoga. He knows it thoroughly. He'll

36
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:11,710
tell you each and every thing: How to cure
you chakras. How to feel all right.

37
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:20,830
Now today, on this day, I'm going to tell
you about the Spirit. I have told you about

38
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:29,250
the seven chakras, about the three nadis,
the three channels, that are within us. And

39
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,320
today I want to tell you about the nature
of the Spirit.

40
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:46,700
The Spirit resides us in our heart. It's the
reflection of God Almighty. In Sanskrit language:

41
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,680
this aspect of God which is all-pervading
and is the first and the last, is called as

42
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:12,510
Sadashiva, is the Father, who does not incarnate.
We say Yahova, you can say, or the God who

43
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:23,220
does not incarnate. This great aspect which
encompasses everything ultimately and also

44
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:39,660
manifests everything, is reflected within
our heart as the Spirit. This aspect is just

45
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:48,250
the witness aspect. It witnesses the play
of its power, the Primordial Power, the Holy

46
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:58,780
Ghost, to see what is created by Her. He's
the only enjoyer of the game. He sees the

47
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:09,860
game, the leela, the fun. She organizes everything,
it is She who gets divided into three powers,

48
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:17,590
it is She who creates the whole universe,
it is She who gives us this evolution, it

49
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:24,669
is She who makes us human beings and it is
She who has to make us the higher human being.

50
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:31,550
That's the Holy Ghost, the Primordial Holy
Ghost and the reflection of that is this Kundalini

51
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,360
within us.

52
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,360
These two have to meet. They are separated;
the Spirit within you and the Holy Ghost within

53
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:49,120
you have to meet. That is the Yoga, that's
the union.

54
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,780
The seat of the Spirit is on top of your head
here, but He resides in human beings in the

55
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:02,780
heart; of course it comes out also and watches
you. It is not in our conscious mind, it resides

56
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,530
and watches the whole field. [DEL: In San-
] In Gita He's called as Kshetragya, the one

57
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:16,320
who knows the field, the knower of the field.
He knows everything, He watches; He's just

58
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:23,320
watching, where we go, what we do, what compromises
we make, how we run after our seeking, how

59
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:32,210
we go to falsehood, what we do; everything
it is watching. The Holy Ghost is the one

60
00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:39,339
which receives the information and records
everything in itself but the information is

61
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:46,339
given by the deity who is the seed or the
spirit of Jesus Christ who is sitting down

62
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:54,029
there, Ganesha.

63
00:08:54,029 --> 00:09:01,029
The Spirit itself is Sat-Chitt-Ananda. He
exists in the state of truth. Now we do not

64
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:20,689
know what truth is. People say, "God is Love,
God is Truth." Now what is the truth? The

65
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:32,619
truth is this all-pervading power. And this
all-pervading power is the nature of the Spirit,

66
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,980
which gives you the absolute knowledge; now
mark it; absolute knowledge. For example,

67
00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:00,589
if you have to say, "What is the shape of
this ...?"

68
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:07,589
You will say, "It's a pyramid." All right,
but is it a good thing to have a pyramid for

69
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:17,670
a church or not? There could be hundred opinions
on that.

70
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:25,399
But if you ask Me, or ask any Sahaj yogi,
they said, "Yes, it has to be a pyramid."

71
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:32,399
Why? Because in a pyramid there is a coefficience
and you feel the vibrations. It's absolutely,

72
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:46,100
absolute knowledge. That's the truth you know.

73
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:53,100
You want to know if a person is fake or not.
You just put your hands like this and ask

74
00:10:55,149 --> 00:11:02,149
a question, "Is he true?" Your vibrations
will stop, you may even get blisters, if you

75
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:12,329
ask such a question about someone. So you
do not know through your mental activity.

76
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:19,529
A person may look very nice, as I told you,
he may behave in such a manner, that you'll

77
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:26,529
feel, "Oh, what a fine man he is." Is such
and such person is a realized soul or not?

78
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:34,110
How will you know? You'll just put your hands
towards that person and you'll start getting

79
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:41,110
the vibrations from that person; you'll enjoy
them. Only after realization only we can really

80
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:47,490
enjoy other person - really enjoy.

81
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:54,490
One day I was in Calcutta and staying in a
hotel on My way to Singapore, and there was

82
00:11:54,829 --> 00:12:01,829
a very great soul who came to see Me. And
he just sneaked into the room. See, sometimes

83
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:08,489
it happens that some of these great souls
who live in Himalayas and all that, they come

84
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:15,489
in. And he just saw Me and he fell at my feet.
And there were at least five, six Sahaj yogis

85
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:24,540
staying in other rooms and suddenly they felt
tremendous cool, joy falling on them, a cold

86
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:34,470
shower like thing. And they all came running,
one after another.

87
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:41,329
"What's happened, what happened?" And he was
at My feet. They opened the door and they

88
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:47,850
said, "Oh, Mother!" "Mother, how did you come?"
"Oh, Mother!" And then they started feeling

89
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:54,850
him. He was enjoying Me, I was enjoying him.
And they were all enjoying him.

90
00:12:55,689 --> 00:13:02,689
You don't have to tell whether a person is
true or not. There is no mental deduction,

91
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:10,999
it just happens. You start feeling. Even children
are like that, even small children. If they

92
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,929
are realized souls, immediately they'll say,
"This is this and this is this," finished.

93
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:22,569
There's no compromise, how can you compromise?
That's what I told you yesterday that Christ

94
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:29,569
never compromised. He'd never compromised.
How can you compromise with darkness if you

95
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,449
are light?

96
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:42,449
So the first thing you are, you are the truth.
The Spirit tells you what is the truth. It

97
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:53,309
tells you everything about everything. It
is the truth; the knowledge that is pure is

98
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:09,420
the truth. As I told you, Gavin Brown, when
he got his realization, he said, "My father

99
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,999
has not telephoned" and he put his hands there
and he got a burning here and when they telephoned,

100
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:18,819
he found out that his father was down with
bronchitis, and I told him the exactly the

101
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:25,819
same thing. Now a person who came to Me the
other day who had multiple sclerosis - is

102
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:36,759
a very serious disease according to doctors,
but according to Me it is not. And everybody

103
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:42,329
told Me the same centers he was catching.
Of course because I have been in the medicine,

104
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:49,329
I have been in the medical college, I know
these chakras means what. And he told Me that

105
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:57,910
he had this problem. Even if he not told Me,
I would have known that he had this problem.

106
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:04,910
Everybody will see the same centre is catching.
So, you are the truth. Then after some time

107
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:14,670
you cannot bear untruth. You cannot bear falsehood,
I mean, we also are like that, I tell you.

108
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,589
For example, if I tell you that, "You come
along here there's a very nice chair for you."

109
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:30,549
Now you don't see any chair there. "Oh you
sit down, it is there, believe Me, imagine

110
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:35,179
there's a chair." I mean, nobody would accept
that, will you?

111
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:36,699
You don't see any chair. "There is any.-"

112
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:41,199
"No, no, but the imaginary, there is one,
I have placed it, you can't see, I have made

113
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,449
it invisible. You see you just see, you sit
down you'll get it." All right you sit down

114
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:51,049
there, and you sit in that position and after
some time you start getting the pain.

115
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:57,819
"Where's the chair, how do I get the pain."

116
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:04,819
That's what Warren told you, it's very practical.
You immediately know that this is not the

117
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:13,249
way.

118
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:20,249
Now the first centre is very important, is
of the innocence, which gives you the magnetic

119
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:33,519
powers. In the sense not only that you are
attractive but, I mean you attract people,

120
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,569
but magnetic means that you know whether you
are moving to the north or to the south. Birds

121
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:46,569
have this power in them, birds have. That's
how they fly from one place to another. Because

122
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:55,069
they can feel the magnet within. And a person
who is pure at that point, he never gets lost

123
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:59,689
because he knows which side he's moving. I
mean, I have that power, I have never had

124
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:06,559
a problem like that. I move either to the
left or to the right, or to forward. And My

125
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,959
husband who is dealing with shipping, he says,
"I have never met a better navigator than

126
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:10,380
my wife."

127
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:17,380
And it's so spontaneous, I mean, I don't have
to think, I know for definite that you are

128
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:24,289
moving in the wrong direction or in the right
direction. Even the material movement I mean

129
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:30,720
to say. All of them have experience, they
have great drivers and they have got all the

130
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,620
maps and everything. And immediately I know
that you are going on the wrong direction

131
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:43,620
because the magnet immediately turns round.
So the magnet is placed within you there,

132
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:51,919
but it is to be awakened. When it is awakened,
these deities when they're awakened, you become

133
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,630
the truth. Like the light that comes in, you
start seeing everything as far as your feelings

134
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:07,630
are concerned, your experiencing is concerned.
So you become the truth.

135
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:14,190
Now one may say, "How truth could be love?"
That's a very common question. Truth cannot

136
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:21,190
be love because, I mean, if you tell somebody
something that is truth, he may not like,

137
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:28,419
and he may be unhappy and it may not be dear
to him, and he might be very, very worried

138
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:30,909
about it.

139
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:37,909
Manu said, long time back that, "You should
speak the truth and you must speak the things

140
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:44,940
which are dear to others." "Satyam vadet,
priyam vadet."

141
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,240
People said, "It's not possible, it's an absurd
situation, how can you do it?"

142
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,700
So Krishna has put something in between, he
said, "Satyam vadet, hitam vadet, priyam vadet."

143
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:03,700
You say something that is the truth, always
say the truth, and say something hitam, means

144
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:13,429
for the pleasing of your Spirit. That's the
condition. And ultimately that becomes a very

145
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:26,240
dear thing. In the beginning one may not like
it, but ultimately, this will be very much

146
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:35,519
liked, this truth. So all these three he has
put together and said that, "You have to speak

147
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:42,250
the truth, the truth has to be pleasing to
the Spirit, and ultimately, the person is

148
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:49,070
going to enjoy it."

149
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:56,070
So the truth is: everything is illusion, except
for the Divine Love of God that is all-pervading

150
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:10,500
which you can feel through your Spirit. This
power has got telecommunication, it has got

151
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:23,100
all that you have created in the science,
it can coordinate and cooperates. It has got

152
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:32,929
all the angels and all the great souls to
help it and to look after you. And the top,

153
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:42,630
topping the whole thing is the quality that
loves, it loves you. So it doesn't come to

154
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:54,299
you like a sword, it gives you the time to
improve, to judge yourself, to rise, to grow,

155
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:06,509
just as a mother would look after her child,
forgive mistakes, see that the child rises

156
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:18,309
and grows into complete manhood. So it is
love and the love that is so powerful is the

157
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:31,120
truth; and it never fails, it never fails.

158
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,600
For example you might think now, a man like
Sadat has died. [Ed: Anwar el Sadat was assassinated

159
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,559
on 6 Oct 1981, the day before this talk.]
"Mother how do you explain?" I mean, you never

160
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:45,559
die, that's one thing you do not know. He
can be born again, he would be born in such

161
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:53,159
a condition where he'll be much more effective.
He has himself died at the top of his glory.

162
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:05,100
I mean for him, he's a martyr. If you see
from his angle, everywhere in the whole world,

163
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:14,179
"Sadat." Sa-dat, it's a big name too. But
supposing he had fallen in his glory and all

164
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:23,990
that, then he would have died, then God would
not have been just to him, I would say. But

165
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:31,009
he died in all his glory and he can be born
again. And he can take a position from where

166
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:40,809
he can do much better work, in the name of
God, in the field of God because now we don't

167
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:48,320
have to do any more work, otherwise in any
other field.

168
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:55,320
We have had enough of trains, we don't want
any more now. We have had enough of plastics,

169
00:22:56,769 --> 00:23:03,769
now we have mountains. We have got too much
of butter around, too much of food, everything

170
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:11,830
bit too much, I mean the house becomes a junk.
In any field we have overdone things. We have

171
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:19,679
exhausted this Mother Earth. Now what do we
have to do? Only in one field and the field

172
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:27,279
that is of God's work you have to do it. But
first you have to get connected and then do

173
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:34,279
the God's work. And that connection is only
through your spirit, when you become absolute

174
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:41,360
and you have the truth within you as a built-in
awareness. Is the awareness that becomes the

175
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,169
truth.

176
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:54,169
So the first quality of the spirit is that
you become the truth, that you know the truth,

177
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:05,019
that you take a stand on the truth. Look at
Christ. He had nothing to do with women like

178
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:14,830
Mary Magdalene, I mean, nothing to do, I mean,
He was virtue. He was innocence. But when

179
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:26,299
He saw people were stoning her, He took up
a stand. He took up a stand. You have to take

180
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:32,610
up a stand, stand on the truth. And he said,
"Those who have not committed any sin can

181
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:39,610
throw, and you can throw the stone at Me".
And nobody did. He did this because He was

182
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:48,570
standing on the truth. He took a whip and
whipped those people who were selling in the

183
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:57,080
temple of God. At the age when he was a little
boy, he went and argued with learned people.

184
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:07,440
Such people have no fear of anything. What
is there to fear? When you are standing on

185
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,440
the truth, what is there to fear? Truth is
such a light that it gives you complete picture

186
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:19,350
of the whole thing.

187
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:26,350
There's nothing to fear. Your Father, He is
compassion, He's ocean of compassion. And

188
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:38,720
He's ocean of love and ocean of forgiveness.
And He is now within you. Who is more powerful

189
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:50,200
than Him? It's very easy for many human beings
to say, "Oh, we don't believe in God." You

190
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:57,200
believe it or not, He's there. Those who say,
"We don't believe," it is better that they

191
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,330
should come and get their realization and
understand that there is very little time

192
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:09,330
left for such kind of nonsensical statements.
I mean you can at the most say that, "I've

193
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:16,710
not felt God so far and I'm open, if I feel."
But on what basis do you deny? What basis

194
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:28,690
have you got to say that, "We don't believe
in God"? Not only, after realization you can

195
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:35,929
prove God, but you can show His miracles.

196
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:42,700
The second thing, the nature of Spirit is
that He's chitta, He's the attention. He's

197
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:49,700
the attention means when you become spiritually
enlightened your attention becomes enlightened.

198
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:58,009
Now enlightenment, what we understand of these
lights is that the lights are falling here,

199
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:05,009
and we can see things, that's all. But this
attention which is being enlightened, acts,

200
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,840
it works, it has got loops, it has got weapons,
it works. You have to see for yourself how

201
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,570
your attention works.

202
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:33,570
Today there was somebody who went and told
one of the Sahaj yginis that "I was sitting

203
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:40,759
there and I was getting all negative thoughts
and was feeling horrible in my hands and I

204
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,860
don't know why it was happening in the program."

205
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:50,860
So she said, "Here you have come to pay attention
to Mother and to Her work and pay attention

206
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:58,769
to your Spirit. But if you are paying attention
to all the rest of the people here, then you

207
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:01,679
are going to catch them."

208
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:08,679
Is a very simple thing, "Where is your attention?"
Ask this question. This is a very common question

209
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:15,539
in an Indian home, a mother will ask the child,
"Where is your attention?" The basis of Indian

210
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:22,539
life is chitta nirodh, is to fix your attention
in a proper way. Where is your attention?

211
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:35,100
Is it on your Spirit? Or is it on somebody
else, like, "My brother is sitting here, my

212
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:42,710
mother is sitting there, oh, that woman is
very bad, she's jealous of me," all this nonsense.

213
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:49,710
Where is your attention? When you get realized
then you start seeing through the window of

214
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:59,899
the Spirit, your position changes. As you're
looking at Me now, then you come back here

215
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:06,899
and start looking at you this way. Till you
are realized you are sitting before Me, but

216
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:18,440
once you are realized you come here and see
others from there, that's your fort. Nobody

217
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:27,700
can touch you there. From there you see others,
your attention is detached.

218
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:37,309
So the attention becomes enlightened after
realization. You pay attention to anything,

219
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:44,809
it works. It does work, no doubt, you try.
Those who have got realization should try

220
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:54,999
this. Try your attention, but attention has
to be pure. You have to purify your attention,

221
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:04,210
and the best way to purify it is to keep your
Agnya Chakra open. When this centre is open

222
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:11,429
which is the centre of Christ, which I have
shown that it can only open through the Lord's

223
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:18,429
Prayer after realization. When you open that,
then you are in that state where your attention

224
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:30,710
is divine. And you'll be amazed how things
work out, even the smallest things, the material

225
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:41,730
things, the useless things and the great things,
and the subtle and subtlest, and how you start

226
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:49,990
growing. So the growth is to be achieved by
purifying your attention, and to purify this

227
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:59,820
attention is to keep your Agnya Chakra open
and be in thoughtless awareness. You watch

228
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:07,299
something, you don't think about it. Zen said
the same thing but I think people didn't understand,

229
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:13,029
you see, before realization it's like telling
about colors to a blind man. Zen said the

230
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:20,029
same thing, you watch a thing without thinking
about it. They created patterns which didn't

231
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:27,529
mean anything, which you see it without thinking.
But that's only possible after realization.

232
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:35,119
So the thinking process minimizes and you
start witnessing.

233
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:42,119
The higher state than that of attention is
that you jump into nirvikalpa samadhi, into

234
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:51,610
the state of doubtless awareness. Now it is
not doubtlessness because you've argued it

235
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:58,610
out or anything. But is a state where you're
doubtless about things. I mean the way you

236
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:06,139
speak, the way you behave, the way your attention
is, you can make it out that "I'm doubtlessly

237
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:14,210
there." The discrimination becomes so sharp
that you can just say, "This is so and so

238
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:18,019
and so," there's no fanaticism about it.

239
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:25,019
As I told you this morning that if a blind
man cross over something and says, "Oh there's

240
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:33,509
a snake here," and he believes it's a snake,
he believes that it's a snake, that's fanaticism.

241
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:38,980
Because he has no eyes to see and he believes
it's a snake, he says, "Oh, there is a snake

242
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,330
here, I believe!"

243
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:46,490
But a person who has eyes sees, "No it's a
rope, it's just a rope." And he says, "No,

244
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:52,190
it's not, it's a rope." But he has eyes and
when he says with his eyes, which can see

245
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:59,190
that, that it's a rope, he means it, the truth
- then he's not a fanatic. But he's standing

246
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:07,990
on the truth. This subtle difference people
don't understand. Fanaticism comes through

247
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:19,860
blindness and the truth comes through realization.
And at any cost you'll not give up the truth,

248
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,279
any cost.

249
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:32,279
Now when I started My work in 1970, somehow
I knew all about these fake gurus and fake

250
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:40,850
people, I knew about it. And in My first lecture,
we had about, must be having about two, three

251
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:49,919
thousand people, it was a very huge hall and
I told the names of all these fake people

252
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:58,490
and who they were in previous lives and what
they did, by names. And everybody was amazed

253
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:05,799
at Me, they were frightened. There was a Maharajah
who was a friend of My husband and all that,

254
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:12,060
and he came and told Me that, "Oh, I'm so...
I'm very frightened for you."

255
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,610
I said, "Why?"

256
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:20,610
He said, "These people are horrid. They mean
money, they mean their whole earnings out

257
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:28,750
of it. How did you say these things openly
and you took their names? They will shoot

258
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,530
you."

259
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,270
I said, "Let them shoot. I'll see who shoots
Me."

260
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:38,700
They said, "You see they will prosecute you."

261
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:45,700
I said, "Let them prosecute." So many years
have passed, nobody has dared to say that

262
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:53,990
I'm telling the lies.

263
00:34:54,700 --> 00:35:01,700
There is no fear. You love, but you don't
love satanic people, you don't love Satan.

264
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:10,150
The Satan who has spoiled the Kundalini of
people, who has spoiled all the chances of

265
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,540
their getting realization, as a mother do
you think I should say, "They are very good

266
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:22,540
people"? I'm not a political figure and I'm
not seeking elections. Cannot be a compromise!

267
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,020
That's what happens to you also.

268
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:37,020
But by your own self-esteem, by your own glory,
people see, "Here is the leader." And you

269
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:52,970
become the leader of the people. You can,
there is nothing to be frightened of. There

270
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:04,690
should be no half-way, as Christ, as he read
it out to you, that lukewarm people he spits

271
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:12,730
them out of the mouth. If you are hot, if
you are devils, we'll fight you; if you are

272
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:22,730
cold, you're my children. But lukewarm people
are static, because all kinds of forces are

273
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:28,010
pulling, there's no progress of any kind.
You come, you come, negative, positive, they

274
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:35,010
are pulled this way, that way. There cannot
be compromise with truth. And then you will

275
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:46,640
see you will have the real collective force,
the real blessings of God, in every way. You

276
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:57,110
don't have to worry about money, you don't
have to worry about anything, it all works

277
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:04,110
out, everything works out. You can't believe
it how much it works out.

278
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:12,450
I will tell you about these Australians: Australians
were finding it very difficult to get a place

279
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:19,810
to have an ashram, and one day, frantically
one of the girls telephoned to Me, "Mother,

280
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:25,760
we cannot have a place now, we don't know
where to go, we have sold our houses, we've

281
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,970
no place to go to."

282
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,840
I said, "Don't you worry, tomorrow, you'll
get it." And she was surprised how I told

283
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:37,840
her, "Tomorrow you'll get it." After telephoning
and all that, she went home and she received

284
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:45,380
a call... I mean there was a call from a...
estate agent.

285
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:52,380
When they went to see him next day he said,
"There's an ashram available, would you like

286
00:37:54,080 --> 00:38:00,880
to have it?" At a very cheap rate, they got
a beautiful house for the ashram.

287
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,540
In London, we had a some sort of a small ashram
and they were finding it very difficult for

288
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:11,540
all these people to live there, because they
wanted to live together. They said, "Mother,

289
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,910
we must have some more rooms and some more
place."

290
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:20,170
I said, "All right you just pray, it will
work out." You won't believe, we had started

291
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:25,500
a co-op in London, and they said it will take
eight years to get a room out of this co-op.

292
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:32,500
That's London speed, just the opposite of
American. And within a month's time, we got

293
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:40,480
a huge house, huge house with fifteen bedrooms
and two big halls and we didn't know what

294
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,470
to do with it, and at such a cheap rate that
for the whole week, only seventy pounds were

295
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:53,350
to be paid. But then the Sahaj yogis went
and settled down there because in London we

296
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,900
have in thousands.

297
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:01,900
Then they said, "Mother what about for others?"
And within fifteen days we got a huge big

298
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:11,140
hotel with all carpets and with all curtains
and everything provided for, cutlery, crockery,

299
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:21,590
anything you say was there. Every thing - only
for ninety pounds a week, for at least twenty

300
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:33,380
people to live very happily and big rooms
each and big halls. Just we got it. You won't

301
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:41,940
believe but it has happened just before Warren's
marriage and we didn't know where they are

302
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,990
going to stay, all of these who were coming
to get married here, and they had a nice honeymoon

303
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:53,990
in that hotel. They didn't have to pay anything
for it. Yes, it works out. Krishna has said,

304
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,560
"Yoga kshema vahamyaham." You get to your
yoga first, he never said, "Kshema yoga,"

305
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,330
he said, "Yoga kshema vahamyaham." You get
your realization, you get your yoga and then

306
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:11,580
the kshema, the well-being works out.

307
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:17,720
Everything is organized then for you, you
are on the stage, everyone works for you,

308
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:24,720
believe Me, it happens that way. What is there
to hanker after, what is there to ask for,

309
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:31,510
I mean you ask for one thing, you get thousand,
you don't know what to do with them. I don't

310
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:36,280
know really- I don't know with Myself, I don't
know what to do , the way, I'm quite generous,

311
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:43,280
I mean I try to give away so many things but
still My house, oh God! You can't imagine,

312
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:51,410
you can't imagine. In their wedding I gave
fifty-one saris, fifty-one, thinking that,

313
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:56,850
"Now I'll some rest from these saris." Again
I went back, they are still there. I don't

314
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:02,920
know now what am I to do, I brought now some
to America to give away and all that, you

315
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:09,920
just give and you get, everything, you get
fed-up!

316
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:19,150
But only thing that I always, I have been
asking for are the seekers, where are they

317
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:27,640
lost? Where are they? That's something still
there, they are to be saved. Because as I

318
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:38,600
told you Christ is going to come back with
eleven destructive powers and there's going

319
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:45,600
to be no questioning, no realization, just...
All the negative forces will be killed and

320
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:55,790
those who enter into the kingdom of God will
reside in the kingdom of God, will reside

321
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:06,860
there, the residents, the citizens. As He
said, "If you want money, I'll give you gold.

322
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:19,550
But I look after those who hanker after Spirit."
You enter through the door and He eats with

323
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:30,160
you, He shares with you. For a realized soul
the highest human beings are the seekers.

324
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:42,180
You may be any king or anything, what does
it matter, there are so many roaming about.

325
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:49,270
But a seeker is the thing in the eyes of God
as the highest human being, who has to become

326
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,350
a super-human being.

327
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:58,350
So your attention is filled, so many of these
miracles, you cannot imagine how many have

328
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:11,350
taken place with Sahaj yogis. One can write
such a big book. So the attention becomes

329
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:19,910
pure. You just can't see bad things happening,
I mean, you just don't like it, I mean, I

330
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:26,800
feel like vomiting sometimes the way things
are, sometimes. The things that you enjoy

331
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:33,800
normally become absolutely garbage, you just
don't like it, the whole, the priorities change.

332
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:46,830
You become automatically virtuous, I don't
have to tell you, "Be virtuous," you'll just

333
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:52,770
become, and you start enjoying your virtues
and virtues of others. You start enjoying

334
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:59,770
other people because attention becomes collectively
conscious. Our central nervous system is our

335
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,480
attention but this central nervous system
becomes collectively conscious, becomes.

336
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:20,590
You are not bothered; somebody has cancer,
it's all right, "I'll try to cure you." You

337
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:27,590
are not afraid you'll get cancer, nothing,
you are never afraid of it. "I'll try."

338
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,070
You put your hands like this, like that and
the fellow says, "Oh I'm feeling very much

339
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:35,380
better, I don't know, what have you done to
me?"

340
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:42,380
"Nothing." The attention becomes so effective,
so powerful; it does tremendous things and

341
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,440
the attention among yourselves has a rapport.
They all move like the several drops in an

342
00:44:54,710 --> 00:45:01,710
ocean, in a wave of love, it's so beautiful.

343
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:09,140
The white men came to India long time back
as this or that, but when they came with Me,

344
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:17,580
you should see, we have some films how the
Indian villagers, you see, took them to their

345
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:25,060
heart, danced with them, fed them, loved them,
it's so sweet. And they write to them, it's

346
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:33,710
so beautiful, there's no artificial, it's
not just a feeling, "I love you, you love

347
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:40,710
me," it's not there. It's just the enjoyment
of the company of other realized souls. We

348
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:49,530
talk of big things, "Oh, we are all brothers
and sisters," it's all talk, talk, talk, talk,

349
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:55,450
talk. Then you just become, you forget your
color, you forget your nationality, you forget

350
00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:02,450
everything, you just feel, "Oh, thats a Sahaj
yogi." It's a very different plane into which

351
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:13,290
you arrive where you feel so happy, joyous,
the whole thing is a fun.

352
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:19,840
And when it comes to helping, all of them
come together. When they find a negative force

353
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:26,840
is coming, all of them come together. There
is never a discussion among them, never. They

354
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:31,960
try to pull him out. They tell him, all of
them will tell by their own ways and method

355
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:37,320
that, "This is wrong, this is wrong." It's
such a combination, I never have to tell them.

356
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,580
I don't have to tell them that, "I'll give
you some lessons now," for example, "How to

357
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:45,720
carry on among yourselves," nothing, they
just manage.

358
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:51,680
Not only that but a person will say, "Now
see," A will say to B, "See I'm catching on

359
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,530
my Agnya, will you please help me there."
That means, "I'm ego."

360
00:46:56,530 --> 00:47:02,940
And the other fellow he'll say, "I'll... I'll
try." They just help each other, without feeling

361
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:09,940
bad, there is no remorse of anything, there's
no heart burning, no jealousy. What a relationship

362
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:19,280
is established like one finger doesn't have
jealousy with the other. You have no jealousies

363
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:26,280
with the other cells of the same primordial
being. There is no need even to talk of love,

364
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:34,460
you are in love. Everybody can see that your
love. It's really worth seeing how we become

365
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:43,390
so much adaptable, so much silent and happy
people, when our attention becomes collectively

366
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:54,680
conscious, because that's the real source
of joy. And the greatest quality of the sSirit

367
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:06,360
is that you're pure joy. It's pure joy. We
talk of unhappiness and happiness, sorrow

368
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:16,520
and ecstasy and all these words. But joy is
pure, it hasn't got the duality, it's one,

369
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:22,050
single, absolute.

370
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:29,050
I'm leaving you and My heart is wrenching.
The joy is seeing that. Seeing that this Nirmala

371
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:44,130
is wrenching, bleeding. The joy is seeing
and when I go, this feeling, I will think

372
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,820
and I'll think of you and the joy will be
again repeated. That joy of oneness, even

373
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:08,820
in separation the oneness I feel it, the concern.
Which cannot be expressed in words, that silent

374
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:20,590
pulling of your heart - that is also joy.
Joy is absolute, it comes through seeing.

375
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:38,590
You see it and you get the joy. Joy is the
quality when you gradually move from the brain,

376
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:50,670
the attention first goes into the brain, specially
in the West, is the brain first, takes place,

377
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:57,300
means you become the attention, I'm sorry,
you become the truth. Means you start feeling

378
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,850
in the hands, you understand, then you see,
"Yes, it is so and this person has got this

379
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:07,020
trouble, so he must be having arthritis if
he's catching on this, yes true." You start

380
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:14,020
tallying, finding out and monitoring it and
again, again verifying it and you are satisfied

381
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:14,590
with it.

382
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:21,590
So the attention first is nothing but starts
achieving the truth. It's trying to feel the

383
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:37,900
truth but it's dry, at that stage, it'sdry
- in the West, specially, because we are differently

384
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:48,440
made in the West. Then we read the book, "Advent,"
we like it and we see all these things and

385
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:54,610
knowledge and everything you like, you want
to listen to the t- My speech and all that.

386
00:50:54,610 --> 00:51:01,610
You all like it. Is the knowledge because
you see the truth, the knowledge - that's

387
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:10,730
the gift of the brain. Is the central path
as I can say "the awareness." Then you feel

388
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:19,380
your chitta, your attention which is enlightened,
and you're blasted with it. You see the miracles

389
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:25,220
happening, "That's happening..." you are just
blasted.

390
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:32,220
Then the third thing happens; is the joy:
that you are in joy all the time. You cannot

391
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:41,880
keep serious for more than two minutes; it's
very difficult to keep serious. The sense

392
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:52,770
of humor is so beautiful, you never use vulgarity
or hurting things or personal remarks, but

393
00:51:53,990 --> 00:52:00,990
the whole thing is so beautiful. When you
speak, people feel the flowers throwing their

394
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:12,410
fragrance at you. Every action that you do
creates joy, ripple of joy. Every movement

395
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:22,020
you do, every vision you see, gives you joy.
That time you feel perfected. When you see

396
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:36,920
a picture which is beautiful, immediately
you go into thoughtless awareness, and the

397
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:44,520
complete joy of that creation starts dropping
on you, you just feel the joy. Then you become

398
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:51,720
silent, you don't speak... much, you don't
think, you become the joy, ananda. That's

399
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:08,090
the perfect state in which you should be.
It's so beautiful that you want to be there

400
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,310
all the time.

401
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:22,310
This joy is the movement of your ocean of
love. Is the beautiful movement of the clouds

402
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:44,580
that you see. It's fantastic, you just get
drenched into it and you do everything for

403
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:56,090
love's sake and you don't think you're doing
it for love's sake, you do not feel that way,

404
00:53:56,090 --> 00:54:02,760
you just do it because it's so joy-giving,
that it is the greatest thing. You may have...

405
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:09,750
anything in the world will not be that much
joy-giving as this joy of the Spirit which

406
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:16,750
you become. You never feel lonely, you are
never bored. Whether you are alone or with

407
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:26,000
anyone, you are in joy. One should understand
that if you get your Self-realization or if

408
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:34,280
somebody says that they are giving you to
some positive lines, you should know, "Are

409
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:41,280
you peaceful within you? Are you joy?" Forget
about the collective consciousness, is your

410
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:54,220
health all right? That's the minimum of minimum.
The whole system changes. I just say that

411
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:09,870
all of you should achieve that state of joy
by the time I come here next year. And I hope

412
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:18,690
you grow into it, by taking up a stand on
the truth, grow into it. You progress into

413
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:29,120
it. It's so wonderful and so beautiful and
that's what your Father wants you to have.

414
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:37,230
He's the most generous Father; He can't enjoy
His kingdom unless and until He has given

415
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:44,230
it to you, that He has made you sit on His
throne. That's the greatest joy that He wants

416
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:52,680
to have and that's what you should achieve,
that's what you should have, that's your right

417
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:58,970
to have.

418
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:05,970
This is what is Self-realization - you become
just the master. You don't have to consult

419
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:16,040
anyone, you know it. You have to just consult
your Spirit through your vibratory awareness,

420
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:27,690
and you know it. These are the blessings of
Self-realization into which you have to grow

421
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:39,810
and as you grow you start manifesting your
powers: you can raise the Kundalini, you can

422
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:46,890
give realization at the very outset. Imagine
the Kundalini moves under your finger, nobody

423
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,610
can believe it but it has happened now.

424
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:57,510
Even very, very great saints, you see, there
is a very great saint who is more than hundred

425
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:04,510
and eight years of age, and he asked Me, "Mother,
I have spent thousands of years to get these

426
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:09,530
vibrations and these people have got it without
doing anything."

427
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:15,820
I said, "What did you... why did you do it,
who asked you to do it? You should have taken

428
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,960
it easy, you would have got it."

429
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:24,960
He's a very sweet fellow, but because he's
got it through his effort, see he has that

430
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:31,410
feeling that, "I've got it through my effort."
You'll never get it through effort, I tell

431
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:35,110
you. When you are finished with your effort
you just get it...

432
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:41,000
[murmurs of laughter from the Audience.]
Shri Mataji: ...maybe in an abstract way,

433
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,080
or maybe-
Yes! When Buddha was tired, finished, fagged-out,

434
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:52,080
then he got his realization. When you stop
your efforts then only you will get your realization.

435
00:57:53,810 --> 00:58:00,700
"So why to boast of your efforts?" I told
him. He's a very powerful man because he's

436
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:07,700
done lots of things and he always goes on
a big, very big tiger and because he's hurt

437
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:17,730
himself, he says that people have beaten him,
so he's hurt himself so he always uses a tiger.

438
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:26,730
And he's a man with the idea that he has these
powers, that powers. So when I went to see

439
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:31,390
him, I knew that time because he told people
that, "Mother has come, so you go and see

440
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:37,430
Her..." and all that and I knew he was there
so I went to see him. When I went to see him,

441
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:42,970
we had to climb about three miles, one had
to walk up, and I was walking up and when

442
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:49,650
I reached there it was raining and I got completely
drenched. And this fellow is supposed have

443
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:56,650
powers over the rain. And he was so angry
when I went there he was sitting on a little

444
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:06,410
seat of his made of some stone. He was doing
like this, like this, very angry. So I didn't

445
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:10,270
say anything, I went inside his cave and sat
down there in that drenched condition.

446
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:17,270
So he came down and he said, "Mother, did
you do this to kill my ego?"

447
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,620
I said, "What? I didn't do anything. What
did I do?"

448
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:26,630
He said, "This rain wouldn't listen to me."

449
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:33,630
I said, "Now, don't be angry," I said, "Sit
down. Haven't you bought a sari for Me, and

450
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:40,480
you are a sanyasi, I won't take a sari from
a sanyasi, [son?]. You have got a sari for

451
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,090
Me, isn't it? So I have to get drenched, otherwise
I will not take sari from you." And the whole

452
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:52,090
temper melted away, whole temper melted away.
Then I said, "It was necessary the water to

453
00:59:54,460 --> 01:00:01,460
flow over My body so that all the plains around
you becomes beautiful, is vibrated with water."

454
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:10,000
But he is a very great soul I must say, because
he doesn't talk to Me like ordinary human

455
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:17,000
beings talk. His style is different because
he recognizes, he knows who I am. Is a very

456
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:26,440
different thing, and a day will come when
you will also rise, you will rise and grow

457
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:33,440
and grow and there will see the glory of this
great new age, new generation... into the

458
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:46,410
complete newness of the being.

459
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:51,690
Today I was going to tell you about certain
diseases that one has and how to control them

460
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:58,690
and I would suggest that we have a book - are
you going to sell it to everyone?

461
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,530
Yogi from the side: There's a few of them
Mother.

462
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:08,210
Shri Mataji: We don't have many. So we would
say those who have been coming for all the

463
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:14,710
four lectures should buy the book. We are
sorry we don't have many books but we hope

464
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:21,710
to send you these books later on and is a
very good book in which you can see what imbalances

465
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:29,690
can work out, like how you get diabetes, how
you get kidney trouble, blood pressure and

466
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:36,690
then how you have to balance your liver, and
how to look after the security and all these

467
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:46,580
things are written in that book at length.
Quite a knowledgeable book I should say.

468
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:54,210
I took the writer... I should say I really
tortured him. And everyday I used to see him

469
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:04,550
coming up pulling his ears, you see, that,
"I don't know what mistakes I'm going to do."

470
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:11,160
And every time he would come, I would say,
"Now, Gregoire you have to be sweet as well.

471
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:17,910
It's not that sweet, you are still a scholar,
you have to be a Sahaj yogi. And a Sahaj yogi

472
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:24,710
is different from a scholar so you write this
book in such a manner, in such a way that

473
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:31,710
it is sweet, it's loving, it's kind," and
I've tried really to curb it down, curb it

474
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:34,780
down.

475
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:41,780
But he had written two chapters of his scholarliness,
all the scholarliness that he had, and it

476
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:50,270
was like a... really a big boulder before
you when you enter into that book. So one

477
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:56,990
day I told him. "These two chapters, let us
put it at the end of the book," and he really

478
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:57,790
collapsed.

479
01:02:57,790 --> 01:03:03,580
He said, "Mother, how can You do that to me,
it's too much."

480
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:06,670
I said, "But why, what's the problem?"

481
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:11,680
He said, "These two chapters are the ones
which introduce the book and how can we do

482
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:15,340
it? I mean, it's in the beginning and how
can You put it at the end?"

483
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:21,170
I said, "Gregoire, while correcting the book,
I saw to it that these chapters have nothing

484
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:28,170
to do with the beginning, so you put them
at the end."

485
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:34,950
And he, when he placed them there he said,
"Oh the book has become wonderful." And then

486
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:40,080
he told Me, "It's a very good play of Mother
in this, that the intellectuals are never

487
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:47,080
satisfied with the reading once, and they
would like to go into the intellectual rumination.

488
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:54,330
Like the animals you see, like cows when they
eat, then they take it back and again eat

489
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:59,290
it, like that, So is better to put these two
chapters for them."

490
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:01,110
I said, "Now you are not angry with Me?"

491
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:03,490
He said, "No, this is a very good thing."

492
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:10,140
But these two chapters definitely prove that
he's a very learned man. And I told him, "Gregoire,

493
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,250
when did you read all these books that you
have quoted?"

494
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:17,990
He said, "Mother, you'll be surprised, these
quotations just came to me... I never, I never

495
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:19,110
read them."

496
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:19,580
I said, "You never read them?"

497
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:25,130
"Yes, yes, I had read them before, sometimes
I must have read them, but at the right time,

498
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:29,290
I got the right quotation."

499
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:35,690
He's now coming to Los Angeles, he is a diplomat
in the Swiss government and he's coming all

500
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:42,690
the way from Rome to Los Angeles, and he's
a very dynamic person, I'm looking forward

501
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:51,020
to My visit to Los Angeles. If you have any
friends there or anything you can write to

502
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:57,410
them, you can take the address from here so
that they can come and see Me. We have now

503
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:02,570
booked all our days, I am sorry and still
we'll contact somebody from Unity Church,

504
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:09,120
but all the days are booked. It's all right,
and the people can come in any case wherever

505
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,830
you have the programs.

506
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:19,830
Anything else you want you can write to Me.
I'm sorry I can't write to you because every

507
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:27,190
day I work, like this the way I've been working
here: morning, the workshop, evening, the

508
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:36,610
lecture. It has been on and on for years together
now. So, I do write sometimes, but I don't

509
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:43,920
have so much time, but somebody will answer
you. Any question, any problem, anything,

510
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:50,880
please write to Me. I'll be very happy to
receive letters from you and there are so

511
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:57,880
many people who are sorting them out and looking
after it, so you will have an answer no doubt.

512
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:05,340
Please get My address also from the ashram
address from these people. Anything that you

513
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:12,440
want you can ask for it. Even sitting down
here I know your attention, it will work out.

514
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:21,860
Gradually you will change and your asking
will be different and different and different.

515
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:29,220
May God bless you to blossom into the beauties
of your Spirit, so that you glorify your Father

516
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:41,070
and He feels glorified with His gracious love
towards you.

517
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:47,090
Thank you very much.

518
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:52,960
Today, if you want you can just put your hands,
if you had put your hands you would have got

519
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:59,960
the vibrations. I am sure there are some new
people today and they should also feel their

520
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:08,140
vibrations on top of their heads; they might
be feeling already the Cool Breeze, just take

521
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:15,140
out your shoes and you'll feel it. On top
of your head.

522
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:31,620
The tapes are with the Unity Church here,
you can buy them. We have also sending twenty

523
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:32,140
one tapes.

524
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:34,390
[Warren next to Shri Mataji]: They're already
being copied.

525
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:41,390
[Shri Mataji]: They are being copied. We have
so many tapes in London and you can buy from

526
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:49,140
the gentleman, we don't have to bother about
money part, I mean, we are not bothered. Only

527
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:55,770
thing, as he must, they must have told you,
a little problem with our trustees, that you

528
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:59,560
have to just say that we have the copyright,
that's all. We are not bothered as to what

529
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:06,080
you charge and what you do it. So you can
buy the tapes as you like and you can listen

530
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:13,080
to them 
and enjoy them.

531
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:16,660
How many have come for the first time today?

532
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:20,060
[Warren whispers]: Quite a few.

533
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:24,029
[Shri Mataji]: Now just take out your shoes
please.

534
01:08:24,029 --> 01:08:28,270
[FV VIDEO ENDS 77 minutes]

535
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,660
[edit] Transcript begins here

536
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:37,940
Now today, on this day, I'm going to tell
you about the spirit. I've told you about

537
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:38,339
the seven chakras, about the three nadis,
the three channels, that are within us. And

538
01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:40,740
today I want to tell you about the nature
of the spirit.

539
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:44,140
The spirit resides in our heart. It's the
reflection of God Almighty. In Sanskrit language,

540
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:46,160
this aspect of God which is all-pervading
and is the first and the last, is called as

541
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,310
Sadashiva, is the Father, who does not incarnate.
We say Yahova, we can say, or the God who

542
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:48,080
does not incarnate. This great aspect which
encompasses everything ultimately and also

543
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:55,080
manifests everything, is the reflection within
our heart as the spirit. This aspect is just

544
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:08,680
the witness aspect. It witnesses the play
of its power, the Primordial Power, the Holy

545
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:11,830
Ghost, to see what is created by Her. He's
the only enjoyer of the game. He sees the

546
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:14,460
game, the Leela, the fun. She organises everything,
it is She who gets divided into three powers,

547
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:19,200
it is She who creates the whole universe,
it is She who gives us this evolution, it

548
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,770
is She who makes us human beings and it is
She who has to make us the higher human being.

549
01:09:22,770 --> 01:09:26,810
That's the Holy Ghost, the Primordial Holy
Ghost and the reflection of that is this Kundalini

550
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:28,279
within us.

551
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:35,279
These two have to meet. They're separated.
The spirit within you and the Holy Ghost within

552
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:39,890
you have to meet. That is the Yoga, that's
the union.

553
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:42,180
The seat of the spirit is on top of your head
here, but it resides in human beings in the

554
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:49,180
heart; of course it comes out also and watches.
It is not in our conscious minds, it resides

555
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:56,650
and watches the whole field. Infact, in Gita
he is called as Kshettranjan, the one who

556
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:56,690
knows the field, the knower of the field.
He knows everything, He watches; He's just

557
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:56,730
watching, where we go, what we do, what compromises
we make, how we run after our seeking, how

558
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:56,770
we go to falsehood, what we do; everything
it is watching. The Holy Ghost is the one

559
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:56,810
which receives the information and records
everything in itself but the information is

560
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:56,840
given by the deity who is the seed of the
spirit of Jesus Christ who is sitting down

561
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:56,890
there, Ganesha.

562
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:56,890
The spirit itself is Sat Chit Anand. He exists
in the state of truth. Now we do not know

563
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:57,740
what truth is. People say "God is Love, God
is Truth." Now what is the truth? The truth

564
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:03,200
is this all-pervading power. And this all-pervading
power is the nature of the spirit, which gives

565
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:08,800
you the absolute knowledge; now mark this;
absolute knowledge. For example, if you have

566
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,820
to say what is the shape of this, you'll say
it's a pyramid. All right, but is it a good

567
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:13,470
thing to have a pyramid for a church or not.
There could be hundred opinions on that. But

568
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:15,310
if you ask Me, or ask any Sahaja Yogi, they'll
say, "yes, it has to be a pyramid." Why? Because

569
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:16,160
in a pyramid there is a coefficient and you'll
feel the vibrations. It's absolutely, absolute

570
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:19,480
knowledge. That's the truth you know. You
want to know if a person is fake or not. You

571
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,260
just put your hands like this and ask the
question, "Is he true?" Your vibrations will

572
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,590
stop, you may even get blisters, if you ask
a question about it. So you do not know through

573
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:24,720
your mental activity. A person may look very
nice, as I told you, he may behave in such

574
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:25,550
a manner, that you'll say, "Oh, what a fine
man he is." Is such and such person is a realised

575
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:26,500
soul or not? How will you know? You just put
your hands towards that person and you'll

576
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,720
start getting the vibrations from that person;
you'll enjoy them. Only after realisation

577
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,770
only we can really enjoy other persons, really
enjoy.

578
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:36,360
One day I was in Calcutta and staying in a
hotel, on My way to Singapore, and there was

579
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:36,610
a very great soul who came to see Me. He just
slipped into the room. See, sometimes it happens

580
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:43,360
that some of these great souls who live in
the Himalayas and all that, they come in.

581
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:46,260
And he just saw Me and he fell at my feet.
And there at least five, six Sahaja Yogis

582
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:46,610
staying in other rooms and suddenly they felt
tremendous cool joy falling on them. A cold

583
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:46,860
shower, I think. And they all came running,
one after another. "What happened, what happened?"

584
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:47,710
And he was at My feet. They opened the door
and they said, "Oh, Mother!" "How did you

585
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,110
come?" "Oh, Mother!" And then they started
feeling it. He was enjoying Me, I was enjoying

586
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:49,360
him. And they were all enjoying him.

587
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:52,770
You don't have to tell whether a person is
true or not. There is no mental deduction.

588
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:54,050
It just happens. You start feeling, even children
are like that. Even poor children. If they're

589
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:54,300
realised souls, immediately they'll tell,
this is this and this is this, finished. There's

590
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:54,320
no compromise, how can you compromise. That's
what I told you yesterday that Christ never

591
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:54,330
compromised. He never compromised. How can
you compromise with darkness if you're light?

592
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:54,340
So the first thing you are, you are the truth.
The spirit tells you what is the truth. It

593
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:54,360
tells you everything about everything. It
is the truth; the knowledge that is pure is

594
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:54,380
the truth. As I told you, Gavin Brown, when
he got his realisation, he said, "My father

595
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:54,390
has not telephoned" and he put his hands there
and he got the burning here and he telephoned,

596
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:54,410
he found out that his father was downed with
bronchitis, and I told him exactly the same

597
01:10:54,180 --> 01:11:00,250
thing. Now a person who came to Me the other
day who had multiple sclerosis, is a very

598
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:04,280
serious disease, according to doctors. But
according to Me it is not. And everybody told

599
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:04,530
Me the same centres were catching. Of course
because I have been in the medicine, I have

600
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:04,580
been in the medical college, I know this chakra
means what. And he told Me that he had this

601
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,690
problem. Even if he not told Me, I would have
known that he had this problem. Everybody

602
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:11,670
will see the same centre is catching, so you
are the truth. Then after some time you cannot

603
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:11,920
bear untruth. You cannot bear falsehood, I
mean, we also are like that, I tell you. For

604
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:11,920
example, if I tell you that you come along
here, there's a very nice chair for you. Now

605
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:12,410
you don't see any chair there. "Oh you sit
down, you sit there, believe Me, imagine there's

606
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:13,070
a chair." Nobody will accept that, will you?
"We don't see any chair." "There is a chair."

607
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:13,850
"No, no, but imaginary, there is one, I have
placed it, you can't see it, I have made it

608
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:14,970
invisible, you see. You just sit down on it."
Alright you sit down, and you sit in that

609
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:15,220
position and after some time you start getting
the pain. Where's the chair, how do I get

610
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:15,220
the pain. That's what Warren told you, it's
very practical. You immediately know that

611
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:15,220
this is not the way.

612
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:15,220
Now the first centre is very important, is
of the innocence, which gives you the magnetic

613
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:15,220
power. In the sense not only that you are
attractive but, I mean you attract people,

614
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:21,560
but magnetic means that you know whether you
are moving to the north or to the south. Birds

615
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:22,530
have this power in them, birds have. That's
how they fly from one place to another. Because

616
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:22,930
they can feel the magnet within. And the person
who is pure at that point, he never gets lost

617
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:23,180
because he knows which side he's moving. I
mean, I have, I have never had a problem like

618
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,230
that. I move either to the left or to the
right, or to forward. And My husband who is

619
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,230
dealing with shipping, he says, "I've never
met a better navigator than my wife." And

620
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:23,460
it's so spontaneous, I mean, I don't have
to think, I know for definite that you are

621
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:23,720
moving in the wrong direction or in the right
direction. Even the material movement are

622
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:23,970
(inaudible). All of them have it, even they're
great drivers and they have got all the maps

623
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:24,150
and everything. And immediately I know that
you are going on the wrong direction because

624
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:24,340
the magnet immediately turns round. So the
magnet is placed within you there but it is

625
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:25,200
to be awakened. When it is awakened - these
deities when they're awakened - you become

626
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:31,480
the truth, like the light that comes within,
you start seeing everything as far as your

627
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:37,910
feelings are concerned, your experiencing
is concerned. So you become the truth.

628
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:38,160
Now one may say how truth could be love. That's
a very common question. Truth cannot be love

629
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:38,300
because, I mean, if you tell somebody something
that is truth, he may not like, and he may

630
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:38,440
be unhappy and it may not be dear to him,
and he might be very, very worried about it.

631
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:38,590
Manu said long time back that you should speak
the truth and you must speak the things which

632
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:38,830
are dear to others. "Satyam vade, priyam vade."
People said it's not possible, it's an absurd

633
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:38,830
situation, how can you do it? So Krishna has
put something in between, he said, "Satyam

634
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:38,830
vade, hitam vade, priyam vade." You say something
that is the truth, always say the truth, and,

635
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:38,960
saying something, hitam means for the pleasing
of the spirit. That's the condition. And ultimately

636
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:38,960
that becomes a very dear thing. In the beginning
one may not like it, but ultimately, this

637
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:38,960
will be very much liked, this truth. So all
these things he has put together and said

638
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:44,180
that, "You have to speak the truth, the truth
has to be pleasing to the spirit, and ultimately,

639
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,730
the person is going to enjoy it."

640
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:47,180
So the truth is everything is illusion, except
for the Divine of God that is all-pervading

641
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:47,610
which you can feel through your spirit. This
power has got telecommunications. It has got

642
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:47,860
all that you have created in the science.
It can coordinate and cooperate. It has got

643
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:47,940
all the angels and all the great hosts to
help it and to look after you. And the top,

644
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:48,250
toppng the whole thing is the quality that
is love, is love. So it doesn't come to you

645
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:48,670
like a sword, it gives you the time to improve,
to judge yourself, to rise, to grow. Just

646
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:49,070
as a mother would look after her child, forgive
mistakes, see that the child rises and grows

647
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:49,490
into complete manhood. So it is love and the
love that is so powerful is the truth; and

648
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:49,910
it never fails, it never fails. For example
you might think now a man like Sadat has died.

649
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:50,510
"Mother how do you explain?" I mean, you never
die, that's one thing you do not know. He

650
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:50,760
can be born again, he would be born in such
a condition where he'll be much more effective.

651
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:50,780
He has himself died at the top of his glory.
I mean, for him, he's a (inaudible). If you

652
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:50,810
see from his angle, everywhere in the whole
world, Sadat. Sa-dat, it's a big name too.

653
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:50,830
But supposing he had fallen in his glory and
all that, then he would have died, then God

654
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:50,860
would not have been just to him, I would say.
But he died in all his glory and he can be

655
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:50,890
born again. And he can take a position from
where he can do much better work, in the name

656
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:50,920
of God, in the field of God because now we
don't have to do any more work, otherwise

657
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:50,940
in any other field. We have had enough of
trains, we don't want any more now. We have

658
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:50,970
had enough of plastics, now we have mountains.
We've got too much of butter around, too much

659
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:51,000
of food, everything abit too much, I mean
the house becomes a junk.

660
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,010
In any field we have overdone things. We have
exhausted this Mother Earth. Now what do we

661
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:51,040
have to do. Only in one field and the field
that is of God's work you have to do. But

662
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,070
first you have to get connected and then do
the God's work. And that connection is only

663
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,090
through your spirit, when you become absolute
and you have the truth within you as a built-in

664
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:51,120
awareness. It's the awareness that becomes
the truth. So the first quality of the spirit

665
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:51,140
is that you become the truth, that you know
the truth, that you take a stand on the truth.

666
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:51,170
Look at Christ. He had nothing to do with
women like Mary Magdalene, I mean, nothing

667
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,200
to do, I mean, he was virtue, he was innocence.
But when he saw people were stoning her, he

668
01:11:53,200 --> 01:12:00,200
took up a stand. He took up a stand. You have
to take up a stand, stand on the truth. And

669
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:40,760
he said those who have not committed any sin
can throw, and you can throw the stone at

670
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
me. And nobody did. He did this because he
was standing on the truth. He took a whip

671
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and whipped those people who were selling
in the temple of God. At eight, when he was

672
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
a little boy, he went and argued with learned
people. Such people have no fear of anything.

673
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
What is there to fear?

674
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
When you are standing on the truth, what is
there to fear? Truth is such a light that

675
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
it gives you complete picture of the whole
thing. There's nothing to fear. Your Father,

676
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
He is compassion, He's ocean of compassion.
And He's ocean of love and ocean of forgiveness.

677
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
And He is now within you. Who is more powerful
than Him? It's very easy for many human beings

678
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
to say, "Oh, we don't believe in God." You
believe it or not, He's there. Those who say,

679
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
"We don't believe", it is better that they
should come and get their realisation and

680
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
understand that there's very little time left
for such kind of nonsensical statements. I

681
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
mean you can at the most say that I've not
felt God so far and I'm open, if I feel. But

682
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
on what basis do you deny, what basis have
you got to say that you don't believe in God?

683
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Not only after realisation you can prove God,
but you can show His miracles.

684
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
The second thing, the nature of spirit is
that he's chitta, he's the attention. He's

685
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
the attention means when you become spiritually
enlightened your attention becomes enlightened.

686
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Now enlightenment, what we understand of these
lights is that the lights are falling here,

687
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and we can see things, that's all. But this
attention which is being enlightened, acts,

688
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
it works, it has got loops, it has got weapons,
it works. You have to see for yourself how

689
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
your attention works.

690
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Today there was somebody who went and told
one of the Sahaja Yogis that, "I was sitting

691
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
there and I was getting all negative thoughts
and feeling horrible in my hands and I don't

692
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
know why it was happening in the program."
First he said, "Here you have come to pay

693
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
attention to Mother and to Her work and pay
attention to your spirit. But if you're paying

694
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
attention to all the people here, then you're
going to suffer." It's a very simple thing,

695
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
where is your attention? Ask this question.
This is a very common question in an Indian

696
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
home, a mother will ask a child, "Where is
your attention?" The basis of Indian life

697
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
is chitta nirodh, is to fix your attention
in a proper way. Where is your attention?

698
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Is it on your spirit? Or is it on somebody
else, like, "My brother is sitting here, my

699
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
mother is sitting there, oh, that woman is
very bad, she's jealous of me," all these

700
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
nonsense. Where is your attention? When you
get realised then you start seeing through

701
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
the window of the spirit, your position changes.
As you're looking at Me now, then you come

702
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
back here and start looking at you different.
Till you're realised you are sitting before

703
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Me. But once you're realised you come here
and see others from there, that's your fort.

704
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Nobody can touch you there. From there you'll
see others, your attention is detached.

705
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
So the attention becomes enlightened after
realisation. You pay attention to anything,

706
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
it works. It does work, no doubt, it fact.
Those who've got realisation should try, try

707
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
your attention, but attention has to be pure.
You have to purify your attention, and the

708
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
best way to purify it is to keep your agnya
chakra open. When this centre is open, which

709
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
is the centre of Christ, which I've shown
that it can only open through the Lord's Prayer,

710
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
after realisation. When you open that, then
you are in that state where your attention

711
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
is divine. And you'll be amazed how things
work out, even the smallest things, the material

712
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
things, the useless things and the great things,
and the subtle and subtlest, and how you start

713
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
growing. So the growth is to be achieved by
purifying your attention, and to purify this

714
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
attention is to keep your agnya chakra open
and be in thoughtless awareness. You watch

715
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
something, you don't think about it. Zen said
the same thing but I think people didn't understand,

716
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you see, before realisation it's like telling
about colours to a blind man. Zen said the

717
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
same thing, you watch the thing without thinking
about it. They created patterns which didn't

718
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
mean anything, which you see it without thinking.
But that's only possible after realisation.

719
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
So the thinking process minimises and you
start witnessing.

720
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
The higher state than that of attention is
that you jump into Nirvikalpa Samadhi, into

721
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
the state of doubtless awareness. Now it is
not doubtlessness because you've argued it

722
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
out or anything. But it's a state where you're
doubtless about things. I mean the way you

723
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
feel, the way you behave, the way your attention
is, you can make it out that "I'm doubtlessly

724
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
there." The discrimination becomes so sharp
that you can just say, "This is so and so

725
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and so," there's no fanaticism about it. As
I told you this morning that if a blind man

726
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
cross over something and says, "Oh there's
a snake here," and you believe it's a snake,

727
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you believe that's a snake, that's fanaticism.
Because he has no eyes to see and you believe

728
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
it's a snake, he says, "Oh, there is a snake
there, I believe." But to a person who has

729
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
eyes, he knows it's a rope, it's just a rope.
And he says, "No, it's not, it's a rope."

730
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
But he has eyes and when he says with his
eyes, he can see that, that it's a rope, he

731
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
means it, the truth, then he's not a fanatic.
But he's standing on the truth. This subtle

732
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
difference people don't understand. Fanaticism
comes through blindness and the truth comes

733
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
through realisation. And at any cost you'll
not give up the truth, any cost.

734
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Now when I started My work in 1970, somehow
I knew all about these fake gurus and fake

735
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
people, I knew about them. And in My first
lecture, we had about, must be having about

736
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
two, three thousand people, very huge hall,
and I told the names of all these fake people

737
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and who they were in previous lives and what
they did, by name. And everybody was amazed

738
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
at Me, they were frightened. There was a Maharajah
who was a friend of My husband and all that,

739
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and he came and told Me that, "Oh Mataji,
I am very frightened for you." I said, "Why?"

740
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
He said, "These people are horrid, they mint
money, they mint their whole earnings out

741
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
of it. How did you say these things openly,
(inaudible), they will shoot you." I said,

742
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
"Let them shoot. I'll see who shoots Me."
They said, "You see they will prosecute you."

743
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
I said, "Let them prosecute." So many years
have passed, nobody has dared to say that

744
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
I'm telling the lie.

745
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
There is no fear. You love, but you don't
love satanic people, you don't love Satans.

746
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
The Satan who has spoiled the Kundalini of
people, who have spoiled all the chances of

747
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
their getting realisation, as a mother, do
you think I should say they're very good people?

748
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
I'm not a political figure and I'm not seeking
election. Cannot be a compromise. That's what

749
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
happens to you also. But by your own self-esteem,
by your own glory, people see, "Here is a

750
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
leader", and you become the leader of the
people. You can, there is nothing to be frightened

751
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
of. There should be no half-bakes, as Christ,
as he read it out to you, that luke-warm people

752
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
he spits them out of the mouth. If you're
hot, if you're devils, he'll fight you; if

753
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you're cold, you're my children. But luke-warm
people are cunning, because all kinds of forces

754
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
are pulling, there's no progress of any kind.
You come, you come, negative, positive, they're

755
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
pulled this way, that way. There cannot be
compromise with truth. And then you would

756
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
see you will have the real connecting force,
the real blessings of God, in every way. You

757
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
don't have to worry about money, you don't
have to worry about anything, it all works

758
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
out, everything works out. You can't believe
it how much it works out.

759
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
I'll tell you about these Australians: Australians
were finding it very difficult to get a place

760
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
to have an ashram, and, one day, frantically
one of the girls telephoned to me, "Mother,

761
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
we cannot have a place, now we don't know
where to go, we've sold our houses, we have

762
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
no place to go to." I said, "Don't you worry,
tomorrow, you'll get it." And she was surprised

763
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
how I told her, "Tomorrow you'll get it."
After telephoning and all that, she went home

764
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and she received a call, I mean there was
a call from a estate agent. When they went

765
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
to see him next day he said, "There is an
ashram available, would you like to have it?".

766
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
At a very cheap rate, they got a beautiful
house for the ashram.

767
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
In London, we had some sort of a small ashram,
they were finding it very difficult for all

768
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
these people to live there, because they wanted
to live together. They said, "Mother, we must

769
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
have some more room and some more place."
I said, "Alright you just pray, it will work

770
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
out." You won't believe, we had started a
co-op in London, and they said it will take

771
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
eight years to get a room out of this co-op.
That's London for you, just the opposite of

772
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
America. And within a month's time, we got
a huge house, huge house with fifteen bedrooms

773
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and two big halls and we didn't know what
to do with it, and at such a cheap rate that

774
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
for the whole week, only seventy pounds were
to be paid. But then the Sahaja Yogis went

775
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and settled down there because in London we
have in thousands. Then they said, "Mother

776
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
what about for others?" And within fifteen
days we got a huge big hotel with all carpets

777
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and with all curtains and everything provided
for, cutlery, crockery, anything you say was

778
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
there. Everything, only for ninety pounds
a week, for at least twenty people to live

779
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
very happily and big rooms each and big halls.
That we got it. You won't believe that it

780
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
has happened just before Warren's marriage
and we didn't know where they're going to

781
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
stay, all of these who were coming to get
married here, and they had a nice honeymoon

782
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
in that hotel. They didn't have to pay anything
for it. Yes, it works out. Krishna has said,

783
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
"Yoga kshema wahamyaham." You get to your
yoga first, he never said, "Kshema yoga,"

784
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
he said, "Yoga kshema wahamyaham." You get
your realisation, you get your yoga and then

785
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
the kshema, the well-being works out.

786
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Everything is organised then for you, you're
on the stage, everyone works for you, believe

787
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Me, it happens that way. What is there to
hanker after, what is there to ask for, I

788
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
mean you ask for one thing, you have thousands,
you don't know what to do with them. I don't

789
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
know, really, I don't know with Myself, I
don't know what to do , the way, I'm quite

790
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
generous, I mean, I try to give away so many
things but still My house, oh God! You can't

791
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
imagine, you can't imagine, in their wedding
I gave fifty-one saris, fifty-one, thinking

792
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
that now I'll some left from these saris.
Again I went back, they're still there. I

793
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
don't know, now what am I to do, I brought
now some to America, to give away and all

794
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
that, you just give and you get, everything,
you get fed-up.

795
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
But only thing that I always have been asking
for are the seekers. Where are they lost,

796
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
where are they? That's something still there,
they are to be saved, because as I told you

797
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Christ is going to come back with eleven destructive
powers and there's going to be no question,

798
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
no realisation, just... All the negative forces
will be killed and those who enter into the

799
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
kingdom of God will reside in the kingdom
of God, will reside there, the residents,

800
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
the citizens. As he said, if you want money,
I'll give you gold. But I look after those

801
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
who hanker after spirit. You enter through
the door and he eats with you, he shares with

802
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you. For a realised soul the highest human
beings are the seekers. You may be any king

803
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
or anything, what does it matter, there are
so many roaming about. But a seeker is the

804
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
thing in the eyes of God as the highest human
being, first to become a super-human being.

805
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
So your attention is (inaudible), so many
of these miracles, you cannot imagine. How

806
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
many have taken place with Sahaja Yogis, can
write such a big book. So the attention becomes

807
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
pure. You just can't see bad things happening,
I mean, you just don't like it, I mean, I

808
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
feel like vomitting sometimes, the way things
are, sometimes. The things that you enjoy

809
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
normally become absolutely garbage, with the...
don't like it, the whole, the priority is

810
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
changed. If you become automatically virtuous,
I don't have to tell you, "Be virtuous," you

811
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
just become, and you start enjoying your virtue
and virtues of others. You start enjoying

812
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
other people because attention becomes collectively
conscious. Our central nervous system is our

813
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
attention but the central nervous system becomes
collectively conscious, becomes. You're not

814
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
bothered, somebody has cancer, it's alright,
I'll try to cure it. You are not afraid you'll

815
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
get cancer, nothing, you're never afraid of.
I'll try, you'll put your hands like this,

816
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
like that. That fellow says, "Oh I'm feeling
very much better, I don't know, what have

817
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you done for me?" Nothing. The attention becomes
so effective, so powerful, it does tremendous

818
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
things and attention among yourselves has
a rapport. They all move like the several

819
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
drops in an ocean, in a wave of love, it's
so beautiful.

820
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
The white men came to India long time back
as (inaudible), but when they came with Me,

821
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
if you see, we have some films, how the Indian
villagers, you see, took them to their heart,

822
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
danced with them, fed them, loved them, it's
so sweet. And they write to them, it's so

823
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
beautiful, there's no artificiality, it's
not just assuming, "I love you, you love me",

824
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
it's not that. It's just the enjoyment of
the company of other realised souls. We talk

825
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
of victims, "Oh we are all brothers and sisters,"
it's all talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. Then

826
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you just become, you forget your colour, you
forget your nationality, you forget everything,

827
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you just feel, oh, as a Sahaja Yogi. It's
a very different plane into which you arrive

828
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
where you feel so happy, joyous, the whole
thing is a fun. And when it comes to helping,

829
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
all of them contribute. When they find a negative
force is coming, all of them come together.

830
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
There is never a discussion among them, never.
They try to pull him out. They tell him, all

831
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
of them will tell by their own ways and methods
that this is wrong, this is wrong. It's such

832
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
a combination, I never have to tell them.
I don't have to tell them that I'll give you

833
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
some lessons now, for example how to carry
on, among yourselves, nothing, they just manage.

834
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Not only that but a person will say, "Now
see," A will say to B, "I am catching on my

835
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Agnya, will you help me there." That means,
"I'm ego." And the other fellow will say,

836
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
"Alright I'll try" They just help each other,
without feeling bad, there's no remorse of

837
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
anything, there's no heart burning, no jealousy.
What a relationship is established like one

838
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
singer doesn't have jealousy with the other,
she has no jealousy with the other cell of

839
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
the same primordial. There's no need even
to talk of love, you are in love. Everybody

840
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
can see that you love. It's really working
how you become so much adaptable, so much

841
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
silent and happy people, when our attention
becomes collectively conscious, because that's

842
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
the real source of joy. And the greatest quality
of the spirit is that you're pure joy. It's

843
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
pure joy. We talk of unhappiness and happiness,
sorrow and ecstasy and all these words, but

844
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
joy is pure. It hasn't got the duality. It's
one, single, absolute.

845
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
I'm leaving you and My heart is wrenching.
The joy is seeing that. Seeing that this Nirmala

846
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
is wrenching, bleeding. The joy is seeing
and when I go, this feeling, everything and

847
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
outlook of you and the joy will be again visible.
That joy of oneness even in separation the

848
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
oneness I feel, it's such a joy..., that cannot
be expressed in words, that silent (inaudible)

849
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
of your heart, that is also joy. Joy is absolute,
it comes through seeing, you see it and you

850
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
get the joy. Joy is the quality when you gradually
move from the brain, the attention first goes

851
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
into the brain, especially in the West, it's
the brain first, takes place. Here it becomes

852
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
the attention, I'm sorry, you become the truth.
You start feeling in the hand, you understand,

853
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
then you'll see, "Yes, it is so and this person
has got this trouble, so he must be having

854
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
arthritis, he's catching on this (inaudible)."
You start tallying, finding out and monitoring

855
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
this and again verifying it and you are satisfied
with it. So the attention first is nothing

856
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
but start appealing this truth. It's trying
to feel the truth but it's blocked at that

857
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
stage, it's trying. In the West, special,
because we are differently made in the West.

858
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Then you read the book "Advent", you like
it and you see all these things and knowledge

859
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and all the things you like and you want to
listen to My speech and all that. Your life

860
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
is (inaudible) knowledge because you're seeing
the truth, the knowledge. That's the gift

861
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
of the brain, is the central path as I just
said, the awareness. Then you feel your chitta,

862
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
your attention which is enlightened, and you're
blasted with it. You see the miracles happening,

863
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
that happening, you're just blasted.

864
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Then the third thing happens; is the joy,
that you are in joy all the time. You cannot

865
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
be serious for more than two minutes, it's
very difficult to keep serious. The sense

866
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
of humour is so beautiful, you'll never use
vulgarity or hurting things or coarser remarks,

867
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
but the whole thing is so beautiful. When
you speak, people feel the flowers throwing

868
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
their fragrance at you. Every action that
you do creates joy, ripple of joy. Every movement

869
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you create, every rhythm you speak it gives
you joy. That time you feel perfected. When

870
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you see a picture which is beautiful, immediately
you go into thoughtless awareness, and the

871
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
complete joy of that creation starts blossoming,
you just feel the joy. When you become silent,

872
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you don't think much, you don't think, you
become the joy, anand. That's the perfect

873
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
state in which you feel peace, it's so beautiful
that you want to be there all the time. This

874
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
joy is the movement of your ocean of love.
It's the beautiful movement of the clouds

875
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
that you see. It's fantastic, you just get
drenched into it and you do everything for

876
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
love's sake and you don't think you're doing
it for love's sake, you do not see that way,

877
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you just do it, because it's so joy-giving;
that it is the greatest thing, you may have

878
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
anything in the world will not be that much
joy-giving as this joy of the spirit within.

879
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
You'll never feel lonely, you're never bored,
whether you're alone or with anyone, you are

880
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
in joy. One should understand that if you
get your self-realisation or if somebody says

881
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
that they're giving you some positive mind,
you should know, are you peaceful within you,

882
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
are you joy; forget about the collective consciousness,
is your health alright? That's the minimum

883
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
of minimum. The whole system changes. I just
pray that all of you should achieve that state

884
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
of joy by the time I come here next year.
And I hope you grow in it by taking up a stand

885
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
on the truth. Grow into it. You progress into
it. It's so wonderful and so beautiful and

886
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
that's what your Father wants you to have.
He's the most generous Father; He can't enjoy

887
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
His kingdom unless and until He has given
it to you, that He has made you sit on His

888
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
throne. That's the greatest joy that He wants
to have and that's what you should achieve,

889
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
that's what you should have, that's your right
to have.

890
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
This is what is self-realisation - you become
just the master. You don't have to consult

891
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
anyone, you know it. You have to just consult
your spirit, through your vibratory awareness

892
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and you know it. These are the blessings of
self-realisation, into which you have to grow

893
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and as you grow you start manifesting your
powers. You can raise the Kundalini, you can

894
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
give realisation at the very outset. Imagine
the Kundalini moves under your fingers, nobody

895
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
can believe it but it has happened now. Even
very, very great saints, you see, there is

896
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
a very great saint who is more than hundred
and eight years of age, and he asked Me, "Mother,

897
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
I have spent thousands of years to get these
vibrations and these people have got it without

898
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
any (inaudible)." I said, "Why did you do
it, who asked you to do it? If you'd taken

899
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
it easy, you'd have got it." He's a very sweet
fellow, but because he's got it through his

900
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
efforts he has that feeling that, "I've got
it through my efforts." You'll never get it

901
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
through effort, I tell you. When you're finished
with your efforts you just get it, maybe in

902
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
an abstraction, or maybe...Yes, when Buddha
was tired, finished, fagged-out, then he got

903
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
his realisation. When you stop your efforts
then only you'll get your realisation. So

904
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
why to boast of your efforts, I told him.
He's a very powerful man because he's done

905
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
lots of things and he always goes on a big,
very big tiger and because he's hurt himself,

906
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
he says that people have beaten him, so he's
hurt himself so he always uses a tiger. And

907
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
he's a man with the idea that he has this
power, that power. When I went to see him,

908
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
I knew that because he told people that Mother
has come, so you go and see Her and all that

909
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and I knew he was there so I went to see him.
When I went to see him, we had to climb about

910
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
three miles, one has to walk up, and I was
walking up and when I reached there it was

911
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
raining and I got completely drenched. And
this fellow is supposed powers over the rain.

912
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
And he was so angry when I went there he was
sitting on a little seat of his made of some

913
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
straws. He was doing like this, like this,
very angry. So I didn't say anything, I went

914
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
inside his thing and sat down there in that
drenched condition. He came down and he said,

915
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
"Mother, did you do this to kill my ego?"
I said, "What, I didn't do anything. What

916
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
did I do?" He said, "This rain wouldn't listen
to me." I said, "Now, don't be angry, sit

917
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
down. Haven't you bought a sari for Me, and
you are a sanyasi, I won't take a sari from

918
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
a sanyasi now. You've have got a sari for
Me isn't it? So I have to get drenched, otherwise

919
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
I will not take a sari from you." And the
whole temper melted, whole temper melted away.

920
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Then I said, "It was necessary the water to
flow over My body so that all the plains around

921
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you become beautiful, is vibrated with water."
But he is a very great soul I must say, because

922
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
he doesn't talk to Me like ordinary human
beings talk. His style is different because

923
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
he recognises, he knows who I am. He's a very
different being, and a day will come when

924
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you will also rise, you'll rise and grow and
grow and there we'll see the glory of this

925
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
great new age, new generation into the complete
newness of the (inaudible).

926
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Today I was going to tell you about certain
diseases that one has and how to control them

927
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and I would suggest that we have a book, are
you going to sell it to everyone? We don't

928
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
have many. So we would say those who have
been coming for all the four lectures should

929
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
buy the book. We're sorry we don't have many
books but we hope to send you these books

930
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
later on and it's a very good book in which
we can see what imbalances can work out, like

931
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
how you get diabetes, how you get kidney trouble,
blood pressure and then how you have to balance

932
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
your liver, and how to look after the security
and all these things are written in that book

933
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
at length. Quite a knowledgeable book I should
say.

934
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
I took the writer, I should say I really tortured
him. And everyday I used to see him coming

935
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
up pulling his ear, you see, that I don't
know what mistakes I'm going to do. And everytime

936
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
he would come, I would say, "Now, Gregoire
you have to be sweeter. It's not that sweet,

937
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you're still a scholar, you have to be a Sahaja
Yogi," and a Sahaja Yogi is different from

938
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
a scholar, he writes his book in such a manner,
in such a way that it's sweet, it's lovable,

939
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
it's kind and I've tried really to curb it
down, curb it down. But he has written two

940
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
chapters of his scholarliness, all the scholarliness
that he has, and it was like the really big

941
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
boulder (inaudible) enter into that book.
So one day I told him. "These two chapters

942
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
let us put it at the end of the book," and
he really collapsed. He said, "Mother, how

943
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
can you do that to me, it's too much." I said,
"But why, what's the problem?" He said, "These

944
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
two chapters are the ones which introduce
the book and how can you do it, I mean, it's

945
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
in the beginning and how can you put it at
the end." I said, "Gregoire, while correcting

946
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
the book, I saw to it that these chapters
have nothing to do with the beginning, so

947
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
you put them at the end." And he (inaudible),
"Oh the book has become wonderful." And then

948
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
he told me it'a a very good play of Mother
in this, that the intellectuals are never

949
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
satisfied with the reason why, and they would
like to go into the intellectual rumination.

950
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Like the animals, you see, like cows when
they eat, then they take it back and again

951
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
eat it, like that. It's better to put these
two chapters for them. I said, "Now you are

952
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
not angry with me?" He said, "No, it's a very
good thing." But these two chapters definitely

953
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
prove that he's a very learned man. And I
told him, "Gregoire, when did you read all

954
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
these books that you've quoted." He said,
"Mother, you'll be surprised, these quotations

955
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
just came to me, and I never, I never read
them." I said, "You never read them?" "Yes,

956
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
yes I've read them before, sometime I must
have read them, but at the right time, I got

957
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
the right quotation."

958
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
He's now coming to Los Angeles, he is a diplomat
in the Swiss government, and he's coming all

959
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
the way from Rome. (inaudible), and he's a
very dynamic person, I'm looking forward to

960
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
My visit to Los Angeles. If you have any friends
there or anything you can write to them, you

961
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
can take the address from here so that they
can come and see you. We have now booked all

962
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
our dates, I'm sorry and still we'll contact
somebody from Unity Church, but all the days

963
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
are booked. It's alright, the people can come
in any case whenever you have the program.

964
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Anything else you want you can write to Me.
I'm sorry I can't write to you because everyday

965
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
I work, like this the way I've been working,
morning, the workshops, evening, the lecture.

966
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
It has been on and on for years together now.
So, I do write sometimes, but I don't have

967
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
the time, but somebody will answer you. Any
question, any problem, anything, please write.

968
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
I'll be very happy to receive letters from
you and there are so many people who are sorting

969
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
them out and looking after this, you will
have an answer no doubt. Please get My address

970
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
also from the ashram address from these people.
Anything that you want you can ask for it.

971
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
Even sitting down here I know your attention.
It will work out. Gradually you will change

972
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
and your asking will be different and different
and different.

973
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,010
