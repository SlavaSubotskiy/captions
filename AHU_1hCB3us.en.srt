1
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:36,260
When we say we are seeking, we must know that
we are a special category of people. People

2
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:50,820
were seeking before also. They were seeking
power, money, possessions, affluence, every

3
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:01,449
sort of thing. Still they are not satisfied
- those who have got it. And so those who

4
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:14,810
are seeking the truth are the highest, highest
of all in the evolution. They are the ones

5
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:26,549
who are going to jump into that higher state
which is called as self-realization.

6
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:36,500
If you are not seeking, then nobody can force
seeking on you. It cannot be done. Even by

7
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,240
force, if you take somebody to the beautiful
lake of nectar of God's love and even if you

8
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:56,100
force the person to drink it, it is you who
has to enjoy it and unless and until you have

9
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:03,740
the seeking, you will not have the sensitivity
to enjoy that nectar. And truth is what it

10
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:12,240
is. We cannot change it, we cannot organize
it, we cannot transform it. It is, it has

11
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,000
been, it will be.

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And what is the truth? The truth is that God
loves us, that His divine power of love is

13
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:36,620
all-pervading, is everywhere, that this power
is acting all the time - it is a living power

14
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:46,159
of a living God - and that this power does
all the things that we call as living work

15
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:53,939
of God. A flower is transformed into a fruit
by this power. This body we get out of that

16
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,709
power. From amoeba to this stage we have come
out of that power. The whole world is created

17
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:08,709
out of that power. In everything that power
resides and works out, sorts out, co-ordinates

18
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,129
things for us. Above all, it is the love of
God. It's the compassion of God.

19
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:24,129
We human beings have not got the comprehension
of His love; we try to see Him through our

20
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:35,010
own angles, through our short sight, through
our blinkers that we have got. He is the ocean,

21
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:42,359
ocean of love. All the oceans put together
cannot be compared with that ocean of love,

22
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:49,359
that ocean of forgiveness, an ocean of complete
well-being for us. Only thing, we have to

23
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:58,629
jump into it. We have to enter into His kingdom.
That is what one has to do. When it is accomplished,

24
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:10,319
then you are just there. You are looked after.
That is the domain of God I am talking about

25
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:19,969
and there, when you enter in, as a by-product,
all kinds of well-being are blessed upon you,

26
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:28,080
just they are bestowed upon you. You just
get them automatically. But this happening

27
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,080
also is not our doing. This also is the doing
of God. He has arranged us in this way that

28
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,690
you can see in the chart - this is the life
tree - or you (can) say the tree of life as

29
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,460
described.

30
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:50,590
And this is the one that is within us already
placed. All these centers, which are subtle

31
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:57,590
centers, are expressed outside as gross centers.
When this residual force of Kundalini, which

32
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:09,180
people must have explained to you, from that
sacred bone or sacrum rises and pierces through

33
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:16,380
all these centers, it enlightens all of them
one by one. By that enlightenment only, you

34
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:23,030
get your physical well-being, your mental
well-being, your emotional well-being and

35
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:30,030
ultimately, your spiritual well being. That
means you become the spirit. Once you become

36
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,400
that absolute, the absolute, then all relativity
drops off. We actually live in a relative

37
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,730
world which is false, which is not true.

38
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:45,730
This power has its own telecommunication.
It's so tremendous that it is unbelievable

39
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,620
that such a power exists around us and we
are not aware of it. We are not aware of many

40
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,250
things. We are not aware that this Mother
Earth is moving with such a tremendous speed.

41
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,750
We are standing on top of that; nothing happens
to you. We are not aware of the gravity. We

42
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:09,750
are not aware of many things because God is
so kind, so gentle and so thoughtful that

43
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:17,740
He wants us to live happily as human beings.
So He doesn't want us to hear some things

44
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,960
which are not good for us, for our ears, so
He makes the frequency of these things so

45
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,960
sharp that we can't hear with these ears.
Some of them, He makes them so low that you

46
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,080
can't hear. Only what you can hear and enjoy
He makes you hear.

47
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:43,080
But we in our freedom have done a lot of wrong
to ourselves, to each other, to our society,

48
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:50,150
to the whole world. Once we realize, this
freedom is nothing but is our ego, our ego,

49
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:01,610
which has created this problem for all other
people. Then we have also another thing where

50
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:09,970
we get conditioned, which creates the superego.
Now in our activity, which is the right side

51
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,090
sympathetic nervous system, we accumulate
this horrible thing called ego, because when

52
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:21,090
we act, we think we are doing it, we are in-charge.
We are not. He is in charge. We are really

53
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,740
doing nothing. What are we doing?

54
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:34,740
Like the people ask me, "Mother how can you
cure everything so easily?" It's simple. How

55
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,130
do you make a flower into a fruit? To us,
we take it for granted. We are not bothered

56
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:47,130
to find out, but can you do it? It's so difficult.
Can you do it? We can't. But if it is God's

57
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,930
power, it can do it. So if you also have the
God's power flowing in you, which will happen

58
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,940
to you as soon as you get your realization,
you can do it; anybody can do it.

59
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,800
It's very simple. Like any instrument, when
it is put to the mains, it starts acting and

60
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,580
then we can see that it is an instrument.
Otherwise it looks like some funny stuff here.

61
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,080
It has to be put to the mains. The instrument
is ready, but within us these two things,

62
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,240
called the ego and superego as a result of
our activity and as a result of our conditioning,

63
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:30,240
are accumulated in our brain. These two are
to be sucked in. That's very important because

64
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:38,019
when they grow, these two elements - or two,
we can, say balloon-like structures - they

65
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:45,019
make a very strong gap filled with calcium
and you become an egg. Another becomes an

66
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:56,889
egg. Third person becomes an egg. You develop
your I-ness - I am this, I am that. All kinds

67
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:05,750
of misidentifications start coming on us.
When this is to be sucked, what should we

68
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:15,120
do? That's the question. What are we to do?
To raise the Kundalini. As I said, it is a

69
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,430
living process and you cannot do any living
work - so just can't do it. It is as simple

70
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,590
as that. You yourself can't do it.

71
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:32,110
But somebody who is enlightened, who is the
light, can enlighten another light, because

72
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:37,980
that light is ready, just ready, but you need
an enlightened light to enlighten that light.

73
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,120
Once that light is enlightened, that light
can enlighten another light. But the problem

74
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,150
is when the light which is enlightened tries
to say that "You are to be enlightened," immediately

75
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:53,550
you hit that person. You don't like it because
ego is there, which is ignorance. That's how

76
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:59,370
people like Christ were crucified. What wrong
did He do to people except that, see, He said,

77
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,360
"I am the light?" It's true. He was the light.
No doubt that He was the son of God. It's

78
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,250
true, He was the son of God which you can
prove - on vibrations. By this Sahaja Yoga,

79
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:17,250
you can prove it what He was. He was that,
but that time people killed Him. Why? Only

80
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,400
because He said, "I am the light," and that
you were to be enlightened by Him.

81
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:28,380
You allowed him to live only for four years,
and when He was killed, when He was crucified,

82
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,200
you took advantage out of that and made all
kinds of artificial things out of it. He could

83
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,420
not explain many things which He talked. He
could not say anything. On the cross He said,

84
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,810
"It has been accomplished." What has been
accomplished? Nobody thinks about it - what

85
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:51,400
has been accomplished. So we have to take
reference from other people, those who have

86
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:57,380
been deeper than us, who have gone into it,
who have found out certain things about Christ.

87
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:03,510
And they say that Christ accomplished the
greatest thing, the greatest feat, because

88
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:10,510
He was nothing but Omkara. He was nothing
but the vibrations. That's why He had no body

89
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,940
and only He could accomplish it. And what
did He do? Is to accomplish Himself on this

90
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:22,089
cross where we have this ego and superego.

91
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:24,589
Of course they say that He said he died for
our sins. How did He die for our sins? We

92
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:31,589
say that He died for our sins. We accept it,
yes, because Churches are telling, people

93
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:38,610
are telling, Bible is telling. But how? He
suffered for us. Then why are we suffering?

94
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,240
But when He said, "You are to be born again,"
we don't pay any attention to that. For that

95
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,040
you have found out an escape. You take your
child to the church and they put some water

96
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,430
artificially and you accept, "All right, we
are born again."

97
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,670
I met people who are certified born again.
They quarrel with me and fought with me for

98
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:06,430
nothing at all. I said, "How are you born
again? If you are born again, that means an

99
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:12,940
egg becomes a bird. Have you become something
different? Is there any transformation in

100
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:19,940
you? How do you believe? Why are you so self-opinionated?
If you are born again, what happens to you?

101
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,500
What happens to you? What is born again in
you?" Born again is nothing but the Kundalini

102
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:32,500
awakening, which rises on top of your head
and here is the seat of your Spirit. Of course,

103
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,810
it resides in your heart, but the seat of
the Spirit is here, and once it touches that

104
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:44,480
seat, immediately you start feeling that subtle
thing which is all-pervading within you. For

105
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,540
the first time you feel this cool breeze of
the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost is nothing but

106
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:57,540
the power of God, the power of His love, which
is called as Adi Shakti in Sanskrit language.

107
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:03,930
We don't have to accept anything else from
outside, any dictionary we don't have to accept

108
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:09,990
to give answers to things, to mysteries that
we have been suffering all these days. Once

109
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:16,990
this cross, which is between the ego and superego
is enlightened, Christ is awakened there.

110
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:29,810
He sucks in both these things, your karmas,
your actions and your conditionings, your

111
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:37,089
sins. It is sucked in. There is no more for
you to suffer. Why do you want to suffer?

112
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:42,250
Some people have started another theory that
we must suffer if we have to go to Christ.

113
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:49,130
Why? Did He not suffer for you sufficiently?
Did He not do that? He has done it, then why

114
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:55,730
suffer? Be joyous that He established himself
there at that point. In the Hindu scriptures,

115
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:02,160
He is called as Maha Vishnu. But if I tell
this to them that this was Christ, they won't

116
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,120
believe Me. If I tell this to Christians,
they won't believe Me.

117
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,670
They don't want to believe it because for
them Christ is their contract. They have a

118
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,020
contract with Christ, as if they are the contractors
of Christ. Nobody dare say anything about

119
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:19,520
Christ. It's only they who are the Christians,
and they who are the Hindus, they who are

120
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,500
the Sikhs, they who are the Muslims and they
don't know anything about reality. Just fighting

121
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:32,500
morning till evening in the name of God, the
One who is the ocean of love, compassion and

122
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:40,520
bliss. They are so disturbed, so upset, so
violent that one can easily see there is nowhere

123
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:50,310
the blessings of God. There is no blissful
state. There is no peace in them. Because

124
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:56,529
there is no peace within, how can you have
the peace without?

125
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,110
And this is what it is that one should understand
- that in the name of God, many things have

126
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:06,610
been done which are absolutely against it.
They are anti-God activities because if you

127
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:13,110
become a fanatic, you are anti-God, absolutely
anti-God. You have to see that God exists

128
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:20,110
for the whole universe. Nobody can take His
contract and can organize it. When I say this,

129
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,589
of course there will be people who are interested
in things with which they are identified.

130
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:32,260
They want to carry on with that kind of identification;
maybe they get some money out of it, maybe

131
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,270
some sort of a name or something free.

132
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:40,820
But what is most important is your Spirit.
Why identify with anything else but your own

133
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:46,230
spirit? You cannot get money out of it. No.
The joy of Spirit is the reward of Spirit.

134
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:53,230
Why do you want money? Why do you want fame
for it? Why do you want anything of these

135
00:15:53,350 --> 00:16:00,080
worldly things that are so transitory, temporary,
will finish off? Why not ask for something

136
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,290
that is eternal? Why not ask for the eternal
life of Spirit? And that if you ask, it is

137
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:11,050
at your door steps, you can get it. It's very
simple and easy. When you say it is simple,

138
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,470
people can't understand. They think, "How
can it be? You have to stand on your head

139
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,970
for one life then you have to stand on one
leg for one life." That's the idea they have

140
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:25,730
got about Christ. There is no need to do that
- Christ has done it for you. Believe me,

141
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,519
He has done it.

142
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,290
So now, how to understand it is simple? In
this room, say, there are so many lights and

143
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:39,529
we all can see each other. The room is enlightened.
But what did you do? You just switched on

144
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:45,580
one switch, very simple. If you ask anybody,
"How do I put the light on?" I just put. There

145
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:51,110
is a light there. Just switch on. That's how
you get the light. But for a person who has

146
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:56,720
never seen electricity, it must be a wonder.
How just switching on light, so simple. It

147
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,029
is not in a way. It is made simple for you,
but there is a big organization behind it.

148
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:08,510
There is a big history behind it and there
are so many people who are working it out.

149
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:15,510
There is a big machinery. In the same way,
whatever looks so simple to us is tremendous,

150
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:17,640
is great.

151
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:24,640
But God Almighty with His care and tenderness
doesn't want you to know anything about it.

152
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:32,100
Forget it. You just jump into it. You just
enter into the kingdom of God and enjoy the

153
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,150
bliss, that's all. Why do you want to bother
about these things? Of course, as we are very

154
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:43,820
thought-oriented, people want to know about
it. That's why one has to talk about these

155
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:50,820
things. But best is to get your enlightenment
first and then talk of it.

156
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:00,120
It's a headache to talk about the electricity
and about its history, where it enters and

157
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:05,750
the problems they have had and then after
all these when you have tumbled down, fallen

158
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,850
down, everybody hit each other, kicked each
other, then say, "All right, now it's very

159
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,190
simple. Just put on the light." It's better
to be other way round, that I say, "All right,

160
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,530
put on the light, and then we'll talk about
it."

161
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:24,580
I am so happy to see so many people in Cambridge
today, really very happy because I have been

162
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:31,140
here before also. But we had no response.
I was surprised. Here where there are many

163
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,230
false gurus are working out their tricks.
People have collected thousands of pounds

164
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:43,179
from this place, Cambridge, which is the seat
of learning. Here so many educated people

165
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:48,950
live, intelligent people live - have been
befooled completely and have been pampered.

166
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:55,929
Their ego has been pampered. They have gone
into such trips which are very dangerous.

167
00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:02,929
We had somebody from Cambridge in Sahaja Yoga,
very well educated person, got into epilepsy,

168
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:10,220
going to such a horrible fellow. Lost all
his money, everything, bankrupt and also epileptic.

169
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:17,610
Educated, very well educated, first class
boy, ruined for his life. But why it happens

170
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:26,190
to us, we must think. Why we are enamored
by such people? Because we believe in the

171
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:33,049
superficial thing; because it is being advertised
in such a way. These people come with a circus

172
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:37,260
because they have to attract you. They have
to attract you for their purses. They have

173
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,880
to attract you for their own powers because
they want that people should be dominated

174
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,320
by them because they can extract money.

175
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Their interests are very low, base and we
don't see it. We don't understand it. They

176
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,140
pamper our ego. They talk of big things, "We
are going to make you a minister. We are going

177
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:04,140
to do this." We say, "All right." We follow
all this nonsense. Imagine. This ego is such

178
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:12,240
a tricky thing. It plays tricks not only with
others but plays with yourself also. It cheats

179
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,890
you. The so-called intelligence of the ego
can cheat you and that's how many people are

180
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:22,920
lost. Those who are seekers of ages are lost
because these horrible satanic forces know

181
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:29,920
how to play the trick, how to play the trick
with you and how to take you to their own

182
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,470
domain of satanic forces by which they could
extract all your blood.

183
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:42,940
I am so sorry when I hear that these things
have been happening all over. But in the places

184
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:49,179
where there has been the seat of love, the
Goddess Saraswati reigns, where people educate

185
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:56,179
themselves, all these thing have come slowly
and settled down. There are other things also

186
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:01,640
which are very dangerous. Like people who
are, call themselves, psychologists. They

187
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,799
can be very dangerous people. They are unauthorized.
They have no idea about the psyche. They don't

188
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:12,910
know that psyche also has another side, which
is the right side, which is the ego.

189
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,250
They can be very dangerously placed - person
like Freud. I don't know how people believe

190
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,290
in him. In England, there are so many Freudians.
I am surprised because I used to think that

191
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:28,610
at least English are the wisest among all
the Europeans. But more than the place where

192
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:34,660
he was born and worked out in Vienna, there
are more in England. It is most surprising,

193
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:40,980
what has happened to our wisdom. Even logically
we can see that he was a hopeless case. First

194
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,140
of all, he had bad relations with his mother.
Can you imagine? He had no sublimity of any

195
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:52,400
kind. He was worse than an animal. And secondly
that he died of cancer in such a miserable

196
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,510
condition. And he was nothing but a miserable
personality. How can you follow a man like

197
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:04,510
that blindfolded because he suggested that
you are a sex point. All your relations are

198
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,710
based on sex. There is nothing sublime. Now
see where is the sex point. It is the last

199
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:15,770
- here there is the red - and here resides
the innocence. This first center, which is

200
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:21,210
the innocence within us, is the child within
us, is looking after the Mother Kundalini

201
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:26,390
that you have. She is your Mother. Everybody
has their own Mother settled down in their

202
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:31,169
sacrum bone, so sweetly, waiting for an opportunity
to get this realization. She is going to give

203
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:36,600
you your second birth and she is going to
work it out and this innocence of yours which

204
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,540
you may kill any amount, it's still there
and they attack that innocence.

205
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:46,400
Today I find in all the western countries
there is a big attack coming on their innocence,

206
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,380
on the children. They do not understand that
there is - sex has nothing to do with your

207
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:58,770
evolution. It is not important for your evolution.
Of course a married sex which is a sensible

208
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:04,830
sex, which has a sanction with the collective,
is very important, no doubt, for the society

209
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:09,110
and everything. But here if you play about
with your sex, it's a dangerous game. It gives

210
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:16,110
you all kinds of diseases; it gives you impotency,
all sorts of other problems and worst of all,

211
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:21,660
insecurity in the whole atmosphere especially
for the children.

212
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,260
This is what it is. We have not been able
to use our brains. Use your brains. God has

213
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,030
given you brains, come to logical conclusion.
Like the Mayor yesterday asked me, "What do

214
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:36,610
you do with them?" I said, "First I will bring
them to logical conclusion." See what should

215
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:43,610
we expect. We have known that Christ has said
that, it is written, "Thou shall not commit

216
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:52,280
adultery." I say, "Thou shall not have adulterous
eyes." Are we Christians aware of these warnings?

217
00:23:53,100 --> 00:24:00,059
Not to have adulterous eyes, just the opposite
we have. So that the eyes should be clean.

218
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:07,059
There should be no lust in our eyes. It is
to be at that point, not at the eye level,

219
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:13,789
not at the brain level. It is at that point
and it should reside there. There is placed

220
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:19,429
your innocence, because innocence guards you
against all wrong doings, all wrong things

221
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:24,000
that you do with your sex, and that's how
you get into troubles and you have problems.

222
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yesterday we had people there, many people
came and as the radio fellow has told me that

223
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:37,370
you better talk about how you cure people.
They will be very much interested. I told

224
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:44,340
them all how it happens and we did cure so
many people there, of many problems and so

225
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:50,880
many things can be cured and if you want , you
can get My tape to know about them, how it

226
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,049
happens and what chakras give you this. But
in short I'll tell you how we develop problems

227
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:56,650
within ourselves.

228
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:03,650
Now one thing I would say, that when I am
discussing this, human mind is so funny that

229
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:09,090
immediately they start reflecting upon themselves.
Firstly they will feel guilty. "Oh, I have

230
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:13,150
done this". Immediately they will start thinking
that, "I have got cancer," or, "I have got

231
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:18,559
leukemia," or "I have got that." So if I tell
you about the symptoms, it can be very critical.

232
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,450
There is a very interesting book I read long
time back when I was a child, "Three Men in

233
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,380
a Boat." I am sure all of you must have read
it. It's a very interesting one. In that a

234
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:34,380
character of one gentleman who said that never
read Materia Medica, the book about medicine.

235
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:42,299
Once he read it and he thought he had every
disease, every disease except for housewife's

236
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:52,970
knee and the doctor was amazed when he told
he has this disease, he has that disease.

237
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:58,000
He said, "Why not a housewife's knee?" He
said, "Because I am not a housewife." Otherwise

238
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,710
he had practically every disease and he wanted
a medicine for that. doctor was - that time

239
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:08,470
doctors were wiser I think, he didn't want
to take money out of him - so he said, "All

240
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:13,880
right, I have given you the medicine but you
have to take it when you go away from here.

241
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:20,880
Go to your bedroom and then you can take this
medicine." He went home and opened that and

242
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:26,970
there was nothing but a paper, and on the
paper it was written, "You are the greatest

243
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:33,970
fool I have ever come across. Never read Materia
Medica again and you are absolutely healthy."

244
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,120
So when you start telling them how the diseases
are caused, also people can start thinking,

245
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,020
"Oh, I must be having this trouble and that
trouble." Nothing of the kind. Please don't

246
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,960
think like that. I am just telling you because
you should not go into it again and it should

247
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,110
not happen to you in future, not in the past.
And those who have had problems also can be

248
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:01,450
cured. It's not difficult. It can be cured.
When you get your enlightenment, you can cure

249
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:05,169
people. You can also cure. It's not difficult.

250
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:12,020
So, now we start from the imbalances that
we have. For example, a human being has another

251
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:17,700
funny habit - is to go to extremes. If you
tell him, now in the Newspapers or, say, in

252
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:24,700
the TV it appears that your legs should be
like this, the measurement of the legs appear,

253
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,110
or the measurement of the body appears, all
the ladies will try to be that, to become

254
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:38,100
like the form that is given. But why? It is,
it might be some sort of an enterprise that

255
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:44,090
people are trying to sell something just to
make you thin or fat or whatever it is and

256
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,110
that's why they are publishing these things.
Why just you go into it headlong? May not

257
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:54,620
be required at all for you. Now when they
do it, they do it so much, so much overdo

258
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,980
it that they develop really the problems which
never existed in them .They were normal people

259
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,220
and suddenly they become sick people.

260
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:09,220
So in this way, we have so many extremes we
go to. For example, we are people who are

261
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:15,539
right-sided and left-sided as you can see
here, the people who are emotionally very

262
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:20,880
rich and who go to the emotional extremes
and the people who are more mentally rich

263
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,880
and who go to the mental side more. Those
who have any desire and just work with their

264
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,880
desires and weep for it and they are the most
unhappy and the most miserable people - I

265
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,630
couldn't get this and I couldn't get that
- they are the left-sided people. The right-sided

266
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:45,270
people are that "Why did he get that?" "I
must also get it." Such aggressive people

267
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,380
are right-sided.

268
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,299
Now the people who are on the left hand side
think of their past, "I was so very happy.

269
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:55,750
Now I have married this wretched man and I
am very weak." The man will say, "I have married

270
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:59,799
this wretched woman," or some sort of a thing.
They go on worrying about themselves for nothing

271
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:04,030
at all and making themselves miserable. So,
we have two types of people. The another,

272
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:08,710
one extreme case we can say, is Hitler. Hitler
was the one who was so aggressive. He used

273
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:15,710
his aggressive policies. He got people who
were dead who were aggressive and used them

274
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,100
to entice, to become aggressive. They could
not see through. They could not understand

275
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,270
that they are not a special race and they
became such racists which one can't understand

276
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:29,730
with Human understanding that how can there
be a race superiority when God has created

277
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:35,360
all of us. It's nonsense. It's absolute nonsense.
It has no meaning, no basis. It's not natural.

278
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,480
God has created everybody separately in a
different way but this kind of a thing comes

279
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,440
into the mind. Then you are identified with
certain ideas on the right hand side that

280
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,830
you are an aggressive person.

281
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,780
On the left hand side, as I told you, a person
makes himself miserable because he thinks

282
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:55,010
of the past, but on the right hand side, the
people make others miserable and aggressive

283
00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:00,179
sort of. Both sides are wrong. You have to
be in the center, neither in the future, nor

284
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:04,860
in the past. So how to be in the center is
the problem. By saying it or by brain-washing

285
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,280
it, it cannot happen. For that the Kundalini
has to rise but you have to keep the balance.

286
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,620
You shouldn't go to the extreme of anything.

287
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,909
You should not become identified or clubbed
with something which is not normal. We should

288
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:24,909
treat it with normalcy about it. Like if you
ask a person now, "You have to do Hatha Yoga"

289
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,570
There is a new system that has started, Hatha
Yoga, without knowing what this Hatha Yoga

290
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,250
is. What was the basis of Hatha Yoga? There
are Ashtangas and all these things have to

291
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:40,230
be done. I have seen people doing only that
little part of it, the Vayayama, which is

292
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,890
so indiscriminate, which has no sense as to
what chakras are catching, where is the Kundalini,

293
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:48,780
what is the problem. Such people can develop
heart problems, tremendous heart problems

294
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:55,110
they can develop, and they can be extremely
negative people because though they appear

295
00:30:55,110 --> 00:31:00,340
to be very positive, they can be very, very
dry. They can develop divorces. They can be

296
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:05,110
very aggressive. A time will come when they
will have no emotions. Even when their own

297
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:11,360
child dies, they will not feel it. They can
be very, very dry. Now we don't see that dryness

298
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,250
in the back. We do not see that that we are
not feeling the emotions of another person.

299
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:21,780
We do not think that that is important.

300
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,830
Left-sided people are the other way round,
as I told you. But when they go to the extreme,

301
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:31,740
first they go into their subconscious. In
this they see what had happened and they think

302
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,330
of their previous lives and all that and then
they can go into the collective sub-conscious

303
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:40,070
if they go on pressing it too much. Or some
of the people who are interested in their

304
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,679
purse, all such base things, can entice them,
can hypnotize them, completely hypnotize them

305
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:47,080
and push them on to the left side.

306
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:54,080
Now cancer develops on the left side. Leukemia
develops from the left side. Multiple sclerosis

307
00:31:55,159 --> 00:32:02,140
develops from the left side. I haven't seen
one patient who has come to me, who is having

308
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:09,140
cancer, having leukemia or multiple sclerosis
who is a right-sided person. And ultimately

309
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:16,610
they can be epileptic, or they can become
lunatic or schizophrenic. All those things

310
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,320
can happen to them.

311
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,710
The right-sided person, on the contrary, will
get a heart attack. He'll get a heart attack.

312
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:29,200
Definitely he'll get a heart attack, if he
goes too much with it. But first of all he

313
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,799
might develop a liver, very bad liver, hot
temper with it. He may develop a pancreas

314
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,870
trouble that could be the diabetes. He could
develop the spleen trouble which could be

315
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:46,870
a kind of a leukemia which comes out of speediness
but it has to triggered by the left side so

316
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:54,299
it is between the - first the anemia and all
that will happen and ultimately he can get

317
00:32:54,309 --> 00:33:00,370
leukemia after that. And many children also
become patients of leukemia because their

318
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:06,960
parents are speedy. Extremely speedy people
get leukemia because they are all the time

319
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,740
acting on emergency. Simultaneously, they
are working on various things like, you are

320
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,049
driving, you are eating, you are listening
to the radio - horrid news. Early in the morning

321
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:21,789
you see in the newspaper, all horrid thing
are there. They will never give a good news.

322
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:25,330
You'll be amazed. We have been trying to tell
people that we have found out solutions to

323
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:30,929
many things - please publish at least one
line, half a line - but they would not.

324
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:34,750
But if there is a calamity somewhere, a horrible
thing happened, early in the morning, you

325
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:39,700
open the newspaper, it's the only thing that
is talked of. You become so much upset that

326
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,640
emergencies that... Then you have your breakfast,
you have to catch the train, you have to rush

327
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,070
up, you rush up, then you find that your train
is delayed, you start shouting. Specially

328
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:54,659
you all get worked up. Ultimately what happens
is that your spleen goes out of gear. It becomes

329
00:33:54,659 --> 00:34:00,330
crazy. When it becomes crazy - it's a speedometer
- it controls our speed and you become so

330
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:06,929
speedy that nothing can fit into you and the
speed of the production of red blood corpuscles

331
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:11,980
is so much increased that they become malignant.
But of course the triggering, as I said, comes

332
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,919
from the left side.

333
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:20,919
So sometimes the right side can create a condition
for the left side to act - can also be just

334
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:31,010
the left side can work out. If a person is
affected, say, by a position, if he lives

335
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:38,010
near a funeral place or some place where there
is a cemetery or in the churches also you

336
00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:44,820
have all the dead bodies there - I mean it's
something I can't understand. People don't

337
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,270
know about that. Why to put in the churches,
the dead bodies?

338
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:55,669
I mean, normally, anybody who dies must be
cremated except for the realized souls. Realized

339
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:59,940
souls are to be buried. It's a simple thing,
because they give fragrance to the Mother

340
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,800
Earth, they give fragrance to everyone. But
if you bury a person who is not a realized

341
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,099
soul - supposing he is an evil genius - you
know about this that the souls wander about.

342
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:15,730
And I have lived, since I have come to London,
always near a church. I have found all these

343
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:20,030
souls coming up in the night and they are
horrible things and we walk over them. They

344
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:25,070
are sleeping there and we trod on them. It's
a wrong thing. People have no idea as to how

345
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:29,760
to deal with the dead and that's how people
have also created a double problem. The cemetery

346
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,760
is in the city. The center of the city, there
will be a cemetery. All children are going

347
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,250
there. Everybody is going there. Pregnant
women are going there and these busy bodies

348
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:46,070
can attack you. It's a fact. They exist. There
is no doubt about it. Even the doctors say

349
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:52,810
that there are proteins which they call as
Protein 52 and Protein 58, like that, and

350
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:57,970
these are the proteins which invade us, our
being by which cancer is triggered. And what

351
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:02,810
they say that this comes to us from an area
which is built within us since our creation,

352
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:06,810
means from collective sub-conscious. But,
I mean, they cannot put it together as I am

353
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:10,830
putting it because they see things from outside
(and) I see things from inside.

354
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:17,060
Now when I tell about this, people don't like
it but it's a fact. You should not play about

355
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,960
with spirits. These spiritualists, these charismatics
and this sect and that sect..., Penticostals

356
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,570
are nothing but possessions and these possessions
can be horrible and most of the lunatics and

357
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:32,400
all these people are with possessions. You
must have seen a woman walking. Suddenly she

358
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,609
becomes blank. Her eyes are open, nothing
wrong with her. Doctors can't cure. She can

359
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:43,609
be easily cured if you can remove the possession
from her. These are all horrible things, which

360
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,460
can ruin your life and you do not understand
why doctors cannot understand because they

361
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,380
don't understand that there can be spirits.
They don't want to accept it. You can't see

362
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,470
the spirit until and unless you become a Spirit.

363
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:02,609
That is the problem, is that in English language
there are three meanings of the word spirit.

364
00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:09,040
One is the Spirit that is Atma. Another is
the spirit which is dead and the one that

365
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:15,250
you drink is also spirit. So you can understand
how can you have three words, which are just

366
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:20,970
opposite each other meaning the same? Now
I am praying (to) the Spirit which is in the

367
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:25,750
heart, which is the reflection of God almighty.

368
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:32,750
But this Spirit, unless and until it is awakened,
no use talking about it. Better have it done

369
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:40,170
so that you know how beautiful you are, how
God has created you with such beauty, care,

370
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,480
and you are all there intact. Nothing is missing.
You don't have to worry about it. You just

371
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,720
don't have to think about it. "Oh, Mother,
how can I be? I have done this. I have done

372
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,190
that." Please don't think. First thing that
I always say before starting the program,

373
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:56,609
before the demonstration of it or before the
manifestation of it, that first of all say

374
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:03,609
in your heart of hearts, "Mother, I am not
guilty." That's one thing, this idea that

375
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,660
you are guilty, is absurd. It has no meaning
at all. It is not even a speck in that Ocean

376
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,830
which cleanses you.

377
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,859
So you don't have to say that - that, "I am
guilty." Please, for heaven's sake, all of

378
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:21,440
you have to say that in your hearts before
we start any program further. Because how

379
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:28,440
can you be guilty? As He is the compassion
- you can't imagine what compassion He has.

380
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:37,130
He is forgiving. He is complete forgiveness.
At that time if you have to feel guilty, you

381
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:44,430
really insult His power of forgiveness. So
we should not feel guilty about anything.

382
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:48,470
Whatever has happened has happened. Forget
the past, doesn't matter. It is a very important

383
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:53,470
time, important moment you have arrived. The
time of resurrection has come. The time of

384
00:38:53,470 --> 00:39:00,470
blossom has come. You have to become the truth.
It has to work out and it will work out. May

385
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:02,650
God bless you all.

386
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,780
I would request you, if you have any questions,
you can ask me questions. But don't ask irrelevant

387
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:13,260
questions and, you see, offensive questions.
That's very wrong because, you see, I have

388
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:19,950
nothing to get out of you - nothing I tell
you - except that little politics about it

389
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:23,500
that I am a Capitalist in the sense that I
have all the powers within myself and I am

390
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:29,210
a Communist because I can't live without sharing
it. That's the problem and that's why I am

391
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:34,070
here and so people should not ask questions
which are offensive for nothing at all.

392
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:39,030
If you want to get it, you can get it. I cannot
force you as I have told you in the very beginning.

393
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:46,030
It cannot be forced. I cannot promise you.
I am sure it will work out, if you little

394
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:51,310
bit co-operate with me. So be kind to yourself
and be open. You need not have blind faith

395
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:56,920
about me, not at all, not at all, but you
should be open to receive. If it works, well

396
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,130
and good. If it doesn't work we'll see it
the next time, doesn't matter. I am going

397
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:08,130
to be in London at least for three years more.
I hope so. May God bless you all.

398
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:25,599
Now please ask me some questions.
Q. When you say that spiritualists ....spirits

399
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:35,770
are wrong..is it wrong for someone who knows
the secret to try and do something about it

400
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:48,339
....what is so wrong with it?
Shri Mataji: You see the spirits are the dead

401
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:58,099
spirits, are the people who belong to another
country. They belong to another state. All

402
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:02,780
right? They are in the subconscious area.
If you start allowing them to walk into our

403
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:08,070
lives, there will be many who will come around
as immigrants, you see. And you don't know

404
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:15,070
what they are up to and they will attack you.
Moreover, those people who are realized souls

405
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:22,750
or of higher nature never stay back. They
know that this is over and we should go back.

406
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:28,510
Moreover, it is our responsibility also to
see that we do not trouble them. I mean, we

407
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:33,640
have used them; they have lived with us. Now
we should give them their freedom. By keeping

408
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:40,030
them around, we torture them. We trouble them.
And sometimes they can be very, very troubled.

409
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:46,270
Even if they are good people, we really trouble
them. Let them go. That's not the time that

410
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:50,760
they should be here and they will be back
again. Why trouble them? It is because you

411
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,180
are identified with them.

412
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:56,930
Now about sickness, people say that for sickness,
I have known people who are spiritualists,

413
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:01,750
who try to cure. But what they do is to remove
one spirit and put another one into it. If

414
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:08,190
a person, say, he is a person who is wasting
money, say in horse riding, so if you remove

415
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:12,790
him from there, he'll become an alcoholic.
If not, he'll start beating his wife. Because

416
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:16,720
there is no transformation, you see. There
is a gap always if you ....so it is better

417
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,660
not to have some sort of a screw there which
is always to be replaced by something else.

418
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:28,180
So these spiritualists, also those who try
to heal, are just giving you relief in the

419
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:32,480
physical being. Physical being is not so important.
It is part of it but we are not only physical

420
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,280
beings. We are also mental beings and emotional
beings. If you try to be only physical being,

421
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,470
do everything only for the physical side,
then you forget the spirit. And the spirits

422
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:47,680
get angry with you. So you are three of these
things which are to be integrated through

423
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:54,650
your spiritual ascent. All right? So that's
why in any case that kind of a work is of

424
00:42:54,650 --> 00:43:01,650
no help in any way to ask because ultimately
we have to see to the general good of everyone

425
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:02,799
.

426
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:07,310
I have seen spiritualists who have been acting
as spiritualist end up their lives very miserably,

427
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:14,270
most of them. Not only that but whenever they
are in a program you get tremendous heat from

428
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,290
them. All those people who have tried such
tricks... I'll give you a very good example

429
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:22,000
of Doctor [unclear: Lang or Land Side B 11:35],
who was, who died - late Doctor [Unclear:

430
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,839
Land or Lang] International Curative Centre
was in London, I don't know if it is still

431
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:30,089
existing or not. I came to know about it because
so many people in India suffered from that

432
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:35,660
curative center. And they came to me. I had
no idea. Now this gentleman died long time

433
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,150
back and his spirit entered into a soldier,
not into his son, but to a soldier in Vietnam

434
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:45,540
or something. And this soldier, now they write
all this story, I mean they are very frank

435
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:50,869
and honest - I must say they are not hiding
anything. So this gentleman came to England

436
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:55,359
and told the son that I am the father and
he told him secrets where things are and all

437
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:59,089
that and he convinced him that he was the
father. He said that you open a clinic with

438
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:03,530
this name - Late Doctor [Unclear: Land or
Lang] International Curative Centre.

439
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:10,530
Now what they used to do, you see, he got
hold of many doctors who were sort of unhappy

440
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:16,640
or some sort of thing or those who were lingering
behind. So, he used those spirits and what

441
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,480
he did by using those spirits, he used to
write a letter, which I have seen myself,

442
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,829
in many cases, that at this time, at this
hour, we will enter into your body. I mean,

443
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:31,329
they frankly told. They didn't say that "We
are going to do anything divine, and we'll

444
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:35,300
enter into your body and when we enter into
your body, then what will happen, that you'll

445
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:40,070
start shaking. Don't be worried. It is we
who are in you, and once it happens," - it

446
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:43,869
would happen after three months or four months
but they would give exact timing - "and then

447
00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:45,369
you'll feel better."

448
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:50,760
Now these people who came to me suffered from
tremendous nervous trouble. And out of all

449
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,710
these who came, even one percent I could not
cure - one percent. They were such gone cases.

450
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:02,260
They had a miserable old age and I still know
of a lady; she just lays down in her bed and

451
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:08,290
goes into tremors and things and nobody can
help her. I haven't got time to pay so much

452
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:14,720
attention to one individual only. So it's
a miserable case. Every time I go there, she

453
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,040
meets me. I put her right. Again she goes
back to her bed (and) again she gets ill.

454
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:27,040
It's a very long process. I am not here to
cure you, I must tell you very frankly, but

455
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:33,250
to give you realization. But as a by-product
of that, you all get cured. That's it. Just

456
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,540
as a by- product of that, you get cured.

457
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:40,109
Moreover, you must understand that God is
the source of all common sense. He will only

458
00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:45,579
cure such lamps which will be His lights later
on because we don't look after lamps which

459
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:51,849
are gone cases. So they can be born again.
But God looks after those people who can give

460
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:58,060
His light to all. Of course, many people get
cured. I have seen in London, the first wave

461
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:02,349
of Sahaja Yoga started - we have thousands
of them they got cured. But out of them very

462
00:46:02,349 --> 00:46:06,380
few really took up Sahaja Yoga and helped
others. They just forgot. Of course, they

463
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,220
have tremendous respect for Me. When I go
to India; they all fill the hall and all that

464
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,890
is there. But they are doing nothing for Sahaja
Yoga. They are not doing anything curing for

465
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:18,369
others. They are not raising their Kundalini.
They are not giving realization.

466
00:46:18,369 --> 00:46:24,020
It's really... sometimes I feel that so many
people have been cured, so much God has done

467
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:28,609
for them, but they don't understand why God
has done it for them . It is to give it to

468
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:31,450
others. You don't have to do so much for Sahaja
Yoga. You don't have to pay a single pi [short

469
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:35,240
form of Paise]. Nothing is needed. Only thing
is, God has given you this power. All right,

470
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,960
just give it to others. That's all. It's very
simple. And you feel so happy. You are so

471
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,640
employed by God that you do not feel bored
at all. It's such a wonderful thing.

472
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,990
But one must accept that if He has been kind
to us we have to be kind to others. It will

473
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:57,990
just automatically work, no doubt. It works.
I know people get cured, no doubt about it.

474
00:46:58,339 --> 00:47:02,960
Any other question please? Yes, please - little
loudly....can you say loudly, please?

475
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:09,960
Q. Why is the picture sitting on the table
lying next to you?

476
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:19,670
Shri Mataji: Why? You don't like it? It's
a question really something I can't understand.

477
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:36,030
You see, if I am something, if this picture
is My true picture, then why not have it?

478
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:41,640
All the pictures you have of Christ are not
His own. Very few people have seen Him and

479
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:47,300
also there is no one who has taken His picture.
Actually, when I see the pictures of Christ

480
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,109
I get a shock. I said, "How can this be Christ?"
I mean, this miserable creature cannot be

481
00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:55,940
Christ at all, but you don't mind having all
these things around.

482
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:01,910
Even the cross that you have can be horrible,
made of plastic, made of this, made of that.

483
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:07,790
That gives horrible vibrations to you. You
don't know anything about it. With this picture,

484
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:13,619
you'll be surprised, the person who first
got realization got through this picture.

485
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:18,030
In this picture there are vibrations. When
you will get realized, you will know that

486
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:22,400
only this picture has that vibration because
the real thing it is - thank God that science

487
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,130
has given us the real thing. If there were
cameras before, we would have had pictures

488
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:31,520
of all those great people. Because there were
no photographs they said, "Better not have

489
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,280
any pictures." Because all the pictures were
imaginary, done by people who wanted to have

490
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:43,280
some money. With this picture, many people
have been cured. All right? Especially in

491
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:49,460
Australia, a miracle happened. That's how
media took me over.

492
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:56,460
There was a lady, a friend of a very big journalist
and a businessman there who was in coma and

493
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:04,220
doctors said she has got a brain trouble and
she cannot come back to her normal condition.

494
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:10,240
There is a damage in her brain and she is
dying. Then everybody had given up hopes and

495
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,300
there was one Sahaja Yogini and she said,
"All right, you just allow me to put this

496
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,030
photograph under her pillow." And you'll be
surprised: she came to consciousness next

497
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:21,550
day. By the time I reached there, she was
very conscious. So all the media was there

498
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:26,050
to receive me in Australia. I was surprised
because media is the last which attends to

499
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:33,050
anything that is real. I was Myself aghast
to see them there. But it's one thing, no

500
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,690
doubt, and it's really true and it happened
and now that woman is walking about. You can

501
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:42,480
write to her and find out. So this is what
it is.

502
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,890
It's a very good thing that has happened that
we can take pictures now because I think,

503
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:53,890
I cannot meet everyone in this world but they
can at least see my picture. People get cured

504
00:49:56,819 --> 00:50:00,960
by this picture. What's wrong? Supposing your
picture was like that, I would like to put

505
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,910
it there. But is it like that? That's the
point. You see some people say, "Why you are

506
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:09,609
doing it?" I say, "Better you do it. I would
like to retire." Actually, today my husband

507
00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:13,589
was very angry with me. He said, "Why are
you there on Saturdays? Why don't you come?"

508
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:17,930
I said, "Now it has been advertised too much.
I just can't come." He is not, he wants me

509
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,980
there for some purpose and he was not very
happy about it.

510
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,480
So I would be very happy if you could sit
down here and do the job. You see, I'll be

511
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:31,140
very happy. I'll retire. But you can't do
it. And why to feel bad if I can do it? Because

512
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:35,640
you can do many more things that I cannot.
For example, I can't drive, I don't know how

513
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,950
to write a check, I don't know anything that
you know. So many things there are that I

514
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:45,619
do not know. You'll be amazed. I am so simple
that people can call me a rustic woman because

515
00:50:45,619 --> 00:50:51,880
I don't know many things that you know. But
I know one thing: that is awakening of your

516
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:58,880
Kundalini, and then another thing is that
this photograph also knows you somehow.

517
00:51:06,339 --> 00:51:13,339
Yes please?
Q; How did you discover such a quick way of

518
00:51:21,609 --> 00:51:27,329
self realization?
Shri Mataji: Must be something about Me, sir.

519
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:34,030
You better find out. It's true. It's true.
But something about Me, definitely. You see,

520
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,900
whatever our education is, you have come to
us with wisdom and all that, it has come to

521
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:42,069
us through other English writers and western
writers. But if you really go into the literature,

522
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:48,990
you will know that it is already prophesized.
Even William Blake has prophesized absolutely

523
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:54,319
about Sahaja Yoga. He said that God of men
[men of god?] will become prophets and they

524
00:51:54,319 --> 00:52:01,319
will have powers to make others prophets.
But who reads Blake? No one;they read Freud.

525
00:52:02,859 --> 00:52:09,859
He's described to such a detail about Sahaja
Yoga that sometimes I am amazed. No Indian

526
00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:13,839
seer has seen that what William Blake has
seen.

527
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:20,839
But our mentality is funny because once he
had his exhibition; I went to see his exhibition

528
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:25,250
and people were looking at nude women that
he had painted. He was innocent. He didn't

529
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:31,140
paint any nudity; he just painted women without
any dress, just the body. But they were looking

530
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:38,140
at the nude women. So, look at our mentality.
Looking at William Blake also we praise him

531
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:43,550
because he has painted women without dress.
He was innocent.

532
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:49,890
It has to be done. The time has come. At the
beginning of life, I know there were hardly

533
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:56,890
one or two people, but today is the time,
a time where many have to become. As you know,

534
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:03,359
on the tree of life there were few flowers.
Now there has to be many flowers because the

535
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:10,359
blossom time has come and it has to be simple.
But supposing it is simple, must you not accept?

536
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:17,470
It's like my grandmother saying, "I don't
believe you can go to moon. How can it be

537
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:23,270
possible?" It's like that. It's a jet age.
If there is speed outside, if the tree is

538
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:28,380
growing outside too much, something must have
grown inside: the roots. And this is the knowledge

539
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:35,109
of the roots which you do not know, which
you should know, how it has grown, what it

540
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:39,130
is sucking. All right? If it is so, why not
have it?

541
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:44,329
I mean, if I say there's a diamond, will you
refuse it? You'll say, "All right, if it's

542
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:51,329
diamond then let us see." It's more than all
the diamonds put together. It's true. It is

543
00:53:56,619 --> 00:54:03,619
very simple to understand if you see God's
point of view. This creation has to have a

544
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:09,329
meaning. And you are going to give it the
meaning. If it doesn't work out, this creation,

545
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:16,329
it is going to destroy, because human beings
are going to be destroyed. You can see that.

546
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:24,910
You can see around what is the situation is.

547
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:33,550
Q: [Unclear Side B 22:57]
Shri Mataji: It's a little confused question

548
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:21,630
because, you see... but I understand what
you are trying to say, that people are seeing

549
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:26,839
it through now because they are intelligent.
They are seeing through and it has reached

550
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:31,290
a certain culminating point, you see. All
these philosophies have reached certain culminating

551
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:36,550
point and they are seeing that, what is the
result. Now the time has come for them to

552
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:41,359
see the result of all their mental projections
we have had about everything. So people are

553
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:45,349
thinking that there must be an answer to all
this. Whatever we have done may have been

554
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:51,079
little wrong or something has been more linear.
It is not expanding us and it is not giving

555
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:55,940
us what was promised to us. So they are thinking
about it and they are going down to find out

556
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:01,220
the answers. That's why there is a seeking,
no doubt. But it is also the plan that they

557
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:04,660
should be here, that they should be on this
earth at this time.

558
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:09,720
All, so many things have worked out. But the
reason is that there is confusion today. In

559
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:14,180
this confusion only, you are going to find
it out. If you were not confused, if you were

560
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:18,470
sure that you are doing the right thing and
you have done whatever is right which was

561
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:23,450
before this, then you would not have thought
of it. But just now people are seeing that

562
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:28,250
we are relatively living: "This is also right.
This is also right." How can that be? If right

563
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:33,089
is one then it should be one. So people are
thinking about it. They are seeking. In this

564
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:37,790
seeking they might do mistakes. And people
might do many mistakes like going to wrong

565
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:42,200
gurus, might spend money for it, may become
bankrupts, might go to drugs, might do this

566
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:48,869
punk rock... all kinds of things. They are
nothing but expression of that feeling within

567
00:56:48,869 --> 00:56:51,599
that there is something beyond.

568
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:58,430
It's true that this confusion has led to this
seeking. No doubt about it. Because they are

569
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:03,170
all challenged. These philosophies are challenged.
Everything is challenged. And people see that

570
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,559
it has given no result. Our forefathers did
the same; we are doing the same. What's the

571
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:13,380
use? We have to reach somewhere. For example,
Jung has talked of universal unconsciousness

572
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:20,380
much before I came. They have prepared the
stage for Sahaja Yoga, I should say. All right?

Side B 25:51].

574
00:57:33,569 --> 00:57:40,569
Shri Mataji: Oh, now don't ask about them.
What do you think about him? What have they

575
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:50,680
done? What good have they done to you? In
general, there is one principle you must apply

576
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:59,410
to all of them. On the gross, anybody who
is interested in your money is not your guru;

577
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:09,150
he is a parasite, on the gross. In the subtle,
anybody who doesn't manifest your powers has

578
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:17,000
no powers of his own. These two you apply
to every guru and don't ask Me individual

579
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:24,200
question. The one who is interested in Rolls
Royce, I mean if you think him to be a guru,

580
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:38,470
I must say this is something surprising. Very
surprising. It's a [not clear: sounds like

whether you have anything in your faith which

584
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,380

Do you have any Apostles? Side B 27:46]

585
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,730
Shri Mataji:. It's again confused, my child,
but doesn't matter. Let's see now...they had

586
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:38,730
a hot air on their head. Did you say so? When
was it? Where was it written? You saw it in

587
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:45,910
pictures?
Reply : In the scriptures. [unclear: Pentecost

588
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:52,099
Side B 27:53]. He sent out twelve men to do
his work.

589
00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:54,440
Shri Mataji: Yes, it's all right. Now, I'll
tell you what. You see, hot air will come

590
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,690
out of everybody's head now. Even you are
sitting here. Because there is heat within

591
00:59:56,690 --> 01:00:03,690
you. First the hot air will come out. You
see, Christ tried to give them realization

592
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:08,079
but they didn't believe Him. Believe me that
they never believed Him till he got His resurrection.

593
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:13,829
No, till they got His resurrection you see.
Till He got his resurrection, they were still

594
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:19,579
like this you see, little half baked, not
fully there. And that's why the hot air came

595
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:19,950
out .

596
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:25,130
You will see now, gradually as you'll settle
down in Sahaja Yoga, when you will be fully

597
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:29,319
equipped, when your vibrations will flow well,
it will be cool breeze. Otherwise, hot air

598
01:00:29,319 --> 01:00:33,569
comes out. You see, with people who have...
most of you will first have hot air, no doubt

599
01:00:33,569 --> 01:00:37,829
about it because there is heat within you.
Now, I will tell you people very frankly about

600
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:44,829
it that when it is hot, say for example take
Helium, Helium is a gas - you know that. When

601
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:52,290
it is hot, all the molecules in it fight within,
revolt against each other. They are absolutely

602
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:57,500
volatile. But when it cools down, they become
collective and they move in a collective way.

603
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,859
Even in science it has been shown and it is
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost which has

604
01:01:00,859 --> 01:01:06,190
been described in the Bible also. So it should
be a cool breeze because even the Apostles

605
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:10,890
that Christ had, they did not get their realization
fully because they were doubting Him. Not

606
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:15,990
doubting, I would say they did not have that
faith till they saw He was resurrected. And

607
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:22,990
after resurrection to have faith was rather
wrong, isn't it? Untimely, I should say.

608
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:30,390
I can understand that. That time, you see,
this was not there. I mean, to talk of realization

609
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:35,730
itself in that country was something so out
of the blue. They were fishermen, not Cambridge

610
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:40,990
students, and you could not explain to them.
But still they were simple people and they

611
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:45,230
were honest, no doubt about it. But to their
honesty, they could not understand how...

612
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:50,160
what this man is saying about self-realization
or of second birth, you see. And so they doubted

613
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:55,890
- was all right at that time. But today it
is not all right because once you get realization,

614
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:58,770
you see for yourself. All right?

615
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:05,770
Q: [Unclear: also had this experience after
the resurrection Side B 30:10]

616
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:11,349
Shri Mataji: You see, they had faith with
Him. But I wouldn't say they got realization,

617
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:16,640
except for John, I would say; but others,
I am not very sure. Because the way they write

618
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:22,819
about His works, it's something an outsider
writes, you see. It's just a ... not a person

619
01:02:22,819 --> 01:02:27,109
who is innate. You see, when they write, that's
not there, I find. But the worst of all I

620
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:30,790
feel is about St. Paul who should not be there
at all. He had nothing to do with Christ.

621
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:34,510
I can't understand why he is there because
according to Sahaja Yoga standard, he was

622
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:38,549
a supra-conscious personality. I don't know
why he put them there because he saw a cross

623
01:02:38,549 --> 01:02:42,869
or he did all this. He was the one who was
killing all the Christians to begin with and

624
01:02:42,869 --> 01:02:46,480
then suddenly, I don't know how - it was a
Roman trick perhaps to put him there - I don't

625
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,250
know why but somehow I cannot explain it.

You see, the other day only one lady saw a

get an experience. Supposing you are taking

LSD, they come and see Me. They just see lights

too much time of others. All right? Now leave

636
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:40,040

it. You see, we should see what have we got

637
01:03:40,099 --> 01:03:45,240

dogmas - what have you got? You see, what

638

are we going to achieve out of it? Just think
of it. What is the use? You have to get the

639
01:03:54,809 --> 01:03:57,780
reality. Why discuss all these things? We
have so many clergies here who have been studying

640

Their heads are off now. This dogma, that

it. Just get the reality first then we'll

Shri Mataji: Of course, that you will be in

644
01:04:17,319 --> 01:04:22,490
meditation. You cannot meditate; you get into
meditation. That is the most meditative state.

645
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:25,799
Now, so I will tell you what happens to you,
all right? Let me talk on that. That's a better

646
01:04:25,799 --> 01:04:29,650
question, a very good question.

647
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:36,650
First when the Kundalini rises - all right?
- you won't feel anything, most of you won't

648
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:44,010
feel anything, but some of you may feel. You
may feel heat in the body. You may feel kind

649
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:50,190
of a, some people might feel the throbbing
in the back in the spinal cord, might feel,

650
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:54,780
little, not much. It's not very painful or
anything. Don't be frightened of anything.

651
01:04:54,780 --> 01:05:00,109
Then it will rise. Some of you might feel
the rising, because if there are obstructions

652
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:04,069
you can feel the rising. If there isn't any
obstruction, if you are not misidentified,

653
01:05:04,069 --> 01:05:09,960
if you are not extremist, if you are in the
center, normally it shoots off in the split

654
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:10,710
of a second.

655
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:16,420
When it shoots off, what do you feel is, you
feel a cool breeze coming out of your head.

656
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:22,660
But normally, as I have seen, people are complicated.
There are complications in the physical, mental

657
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:28,190
or emotional being. People are not so balanced.
Mostly they have liver problems or such things

658
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:33,260
like that. You might get heat coming out.
First the heat comes; quite a lot of heat

659
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:37,480
might come. When the heat disappears, then
you start feeling the cool coming and you

660
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:42,829
feel very nice inside. Then the bliss starts
coming. You start feeling absolutely relaxed

661
01:05:42,829 --> 01:05:47,950
and you feel in your hands the cool breeze
is coming. But first of all you feel on the

662
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:52,670
head. You should feel yourself. Nobody is
going to certify it for you. There is no falsehood

663
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:56,309
about it. It's a thing that you have to feel
it.

664
01:05:56,309 --> 01:06:03,309
And once it happens to you then you can develop
it. Because though the Kundalini at the first

665
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:10,819
shot comes out but then She tries to look
after your different organs if they are sick,

666
01:06:10,819 --> 01:06:17,400
your mind if it is overloaded, or anything
that is wrong it creates a balance [unclear

667
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:21,980
Side B 34:42]... So you have to just know
how to reestablish it yourself because it

668
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:26,369
is your own. Everything is your own. It's
- you can think like this that this light

669
01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:33,369
is your own. It is your own lamp. I just have
come because I have got the flame in Me, perhaps.

670
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:39,740
Then I put the lamp. Your light is enlightened.
Now you look after your light. It's your light,

671
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:46,200
it's everything yours. The power is yours.
It's your mother. It's your own spirit. And

672
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:51,200
then you work it out. Unless and until you
work it out, you will not know whether it

673
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:56,510
is true or not.

674
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:59,770
You have to work it out. Now you should not
be identified with anything, that's one thing

675
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:05,940
is true; because you have not seen the reality
so far. Say, for example, Mr X says, "This

676
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:11,579
one says so." All right, must have said it
but he is not here. Today he is not here;

677
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:16,829
it is I who am sitting here. All right? So
it is better that what I am saying you better

678
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:20,829
receive it because it's nice to live with
the past. Like, people want to believe in

679
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:26,059
the past because it is easy to handle the
past, or live with the future because it is

680
01:07:26,059 --> 01:07:29,829
easy, or live with somebody who has written
a book or something he had done to us. But

681
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:35,290
why not believe in yourself that so far you
have not got anything of your own and I am

682
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:39,069
saying that you have to get it of your own.

683
01:07:39,069 --> 01:07:43,859
That's the main point I am trying to say,
that you must not believe into anything till

684
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:49,430
you have found it yourself within your self.
That's what it is. And if you are identified

685
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:52,799
with other things which you have been doing
- most of the people who have paid to some

686
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:57,290
Guru or some thing, get very much identified
with them. But what have they given you? Have

687
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:02,299
they given you any powers? Nothing. Can you
feel another person? In collective consciousness,

688
01:08:02,299 --> 01:08:07,329
you should be able to feel another person.
After realization, immediately you can start

689
01:08:07,329 --> 01:08:13,190
feeling another person and yourself. Immediately
you can feel, but you need sensitivity which

690
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:17,020
we lack quite a lot in the Western world because
the [unclear sounds like 'light is very small'

Side B 36:36].

692
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:21,440
But in India I have seen people get realization
(and) immediately they start feeling it like

693
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:27,469
that. It's very easy to cure Indians, I must
say, but difficult to cure Western people.

694
01:08:27,469 --> 01:08:32,609
They are very complicated, ego-oriented, over-read,
all that is there. But once the Western get

695
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:38,980
it, they settle down much faster, much better,
much deeply than Indians do. It's like if

696
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:43,920
you have the teeth, you don't have the food;
and if you have the food, you don't have the

697
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,849
teeth. It's a funny combination, this world
is.

699
01:08:50,289 --> 01:08:57,289
All right, let's have it. Now see what sort
of thing you work out in Cambridge. All right?

700
01:08:57,599 --> 01:09:02,759
So all of us should forget all about these
things. Be honest to yourself and fair to

701
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:07,559
yourself. So far, by doing all these things
you haven't found yourself. Accept this fact.

01:09:07,559 --> 01:09:14,559
I have nothing to gain out of you. I haven't
even written a single line, a book, nothing.

703
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:24,859
So you must know that it is your own. I am
just like a banker who is cashing your checks.

704
01:09:27,049 --> 01:09:33,799
Better have them cashed, for which you don't
have to pay anything. You don't have to put

705
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:38,939
in any effort, nothing. But once you are realized
then you will know what is to be done. But

706
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:40,499
first get your lights on.

707
01:09:40,499 --> 01:09:46,789
All right, now just co-operate with me as
I tell you, without much questioning. I am

708
01:09:46,789 --> 01:09:53,789
not going to tell you anything horrid nor
am I going to trouble you by anything. It

709
01:09:54,919 --> 01:09:56,209
is your own blessing just waiting at your
door step. Can you believe Me now? If you

710
01:09:56,209 --> 01:09:56,459
can believe only this much that I am genuine,
it will work out. May God bless you.

711
01:09:56,219 --> 01:09:56,469
All right, now put your hands towards Me and
if it is not very inconvenient, please take

712
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:56,489
out your shoes because this Mother Earth also
helps us. It's better to take out your shoes;

713
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:56,510
it helps. If you are sitting on the ground,
it's all right. You have to touch your Mother

714
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:56,630
Earth with your feet so if you can take out
your shoes easily, it will work out faster.

715
01:09:56,439 --> 01:09:56,689
Moreover, it is a very tight thing on the
feet. Now this is the question of language

716
01:09:56,489 --> 01:09:56,739
of hands which is an international language
always, but this is the language where the

717
01:09:56,530 --> 01:09:56,780
hands get enlightened and the hands have to
speak. As Mohammad Sahib has said it clearly,

718
01:09:56,579 --> 01:09:56,829
"At the time of resurrection, your hands will
speak". So, your hands have to speak and that's

719
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:56,880
how we have to see how our hands will be speaking.

720
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:56,909
So these centers which are shown here are
represented in your fingers. So, these are

721
01:09:56,699 --> 01:09:56,949
five, six and seven, this side left and right.
Once these centers are enlightened, then you

722
01:09:56,749 --> 01:09:56,999
can feel yourself and feel others. To begin
with, we do not understand what it is because

723
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,050
it is too great a thing. But once we start
using it, we are amazed how we start transforming,

724
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:57,110
how things start happening to us.

725
01:09:56,869 --> 01:09:57,119
All right, now just put your hands straight
like this. Sit comfortably. Be comfortable.

726
01:09:56,909 --> 01:09:57,159
If you have anything tight, please make it
a little loose. It's better. Not that it makes

727
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:57,209
any difference; it's very subtle. But why
I am asking you because attention goes there

728
01:09:57,010 --> 01:09:57,260
if it is something tight. On the waist also
if there is something tight you see the attention

729
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:57,309
is gone. Make yourself comfortable. That's
the main point, be comfortable so that for

730
01:09:57,099 --> 01:09:57,349
a while you could be with yourself comfortably.
If you are wearing any big malas and all that,

731
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:57,409
please take it out. It's better. It's heavy.
Anything like that, please take it out. It

732
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:57,449
will help us. Just first get yourself realized
and then you start understanding.

733
01:09:57,239 --> 01:09:57,489
Now, after this I have to tell you one more
thing that you have to keep your eyes shut.

734
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:57,550
The reason is that when the Kundalini rises
above this which it wants to pierce through,

735
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:57,590
at that time it presses this point and the
pupils go into dilatation first before it

736
01:09:57,389 --> 01:09:57,639
is piercing it and that's why, if the eyes
are open and the Kundalini is passing through,

737
01:09:57,439 --> 01:09:57,689
She may stop. So please keep your eyes shut,
that's all. Just keep your eyes shut till

738
01:09:57,489 --> 01:09:57,739
I tell you to open them. And if you have spectacles
and all that, you can also keep them safe

739
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:57,800
because you don't have to see Me anymore till
I ask you to open your eyes. So it's better

740
01:09:57,599 --> 01:09:57,849
to keep so that you don't have problems of
your spectacles.

741
01:09:57,639 --> 01:09:57,889
Now close your eyes. Now don't open your eyes
as I requested you. Please don't open your

742
01:09:57,689 --> 01:09:57,939
eyes, that's all. Because this is just the
opposite of hypnosis. In hypnosis, they make

743
01:09:57,729 --> 01:09:57,979
you open your eyes and put their eyes into
your eyes and do all these things. What's

744
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:58,030
happening? Now, no gesticulations, nothing
abnormal has to be done. Whatever has to happen

745
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:58,070
will happen within. Nothing abnormal thing
has to be done. Nobody has to jump, shout

746
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:58,110
or scream - that's all nonsense. You are not
to do anything like that, not to turn your

747
01:09:57,909 --> 01:09:58,159
necks or anything. Just keep quiet. If you
cannot keep quiet, it's better that you go

748
01:09:57,959 --> 01:09:58,209
out for the time being. But just keep quiet.
That's very important not to disturb others.
