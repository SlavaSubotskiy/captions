because it doesn't give any success

that was wrong.'

that but they are still running after making money
有些人不那样想 但他们仍在追逐金钱

If you are ignorant

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:19,440
then you'll be amazed how you are
helped from within and without
那么你将惊讶 你如何从内在和外在获得帮助

259
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,480
It's a terrible power that works

260
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,080
this thoughtless awareness

261
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,520
So those who do not meditate

262
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,080
cannot go very much far with
the advantage of Sahaja Yoga
不会因着霎哈嘉瑜伽的好处而走得更远

263
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,320
One should try to meditate

264
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,640

thoughtless awareness

265

So what happens to you

If you are in thoughtless awareness

We meditate in the school in the evening

276
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,080
Imagine these small children can say that

connection with the Divine

281
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,120
Without the connection of the Divine

282
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,760
what's the use of doing Sahaja Yoga

I know the people who are meditating

Is a very important point which you should reach

Looking at anything

289
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,320
if you are thoughtlessly aware
若你们是无思虑的意识状态

290
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,320
then you really become reflective about it

Just works out that way

you start achieving it more and more

295
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,240
I've talked so much about meditation before

296
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,920
but today when I see all these candles burning

I think they are all meditative

298
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,240
They are all in meditation
它们都在冥想状态

299
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,600
and that's how they're burning
它们就是那样在点燃着

300
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,120
In the same way

301
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,320
Sahaja yogis who meditate, I know

302
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,840
And those who don't, I know
而那些没有冥想的 我也知道

303
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,240

why the problems are there
若他们有问题 我也知道问题的原因所在

304
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:54,680
Main thing is your connectio with the Divine
is only possible , when you meditate

305
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,160
and become thoughtlessly aware
进入无思虑的状态才能实现

306
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,360
That's the point where Divine works
那是上天力量在这个点起作用

307
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:12,120
it helps you , It comes to your help in such way
在这个点它会帮助你
上天就是以这样的方式帮助你的

308
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,200
that you don't know
how you have achieved it
你都不知道自己是怎样成功的

309
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:24,640
So thoughtless awareness is the first
point all of you should achieve
所以,无思虑的状态是你们首先应该达到的

310
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,000
Very important
这非常的重要

311
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,160
After that we can achieve something else
那之后 我们可以达到其他阶段

312
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,160
but the first step is thoughtless awareness
但是第一步是无思虑的觉醒

313
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:43,160
It's very important to
become thoughtlessly aware
达到无思虑的觉醒非常重要

314
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:49,640
because then there are no thoughts
coming from the left or right
因为随后便不会再有来自左右脉

315
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,400
from the (past) or the future
来自过去和将来的思维

316
00:28:52,680 --> 00:29:00,200
Just in the present you are there
It's something you all have
你就在当下 这是你们所有人都拥有的（状态）

317
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,080
It's not that I'm saying that to you
这并非因为我是这么跟你们说的

318
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,320
but all of you have this
而这的确是你们所有人都拥有的

319
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,360
but steady yourself

320
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,720

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,120
at thoughtless awareness
在无思虑的觉醒状态

322
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,800
How long - that's not the point
能有多久,那不重要

323
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,400
The point is once you've touched it
重点是 一旦你达到它

324
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,000
you'll go on touching it
你就将持续达到它

325
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,960
Many people meditate but their
thought process is going on
许多人冥想 但他们的思想却忙个不停

326
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,360
They are not thoughtlessly silent

327
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,360
Now this is the one point
which is very important
现在这是非常重要的一点

328
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,053
If you have to grow
若你要成长

329
00:29:41,331 --> 00:29:47,089
you should be absolutely in connection
with the Divine,through thoughtless awareness
你绝对应在无思虑状态中与上天连接

don't have to call anyone
你不必祈祷,你不必呼唤任何人

331
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:54,781
nothing , it just works because it is within you
什么都不用,它就是那么有效 因为它就在你之内

332
00:29:55,053 --> 00:30:00,200
All these thoughts are bombarding
from both two sides in your mind
所有这些思想都从你大脑的左右两边不停地轰炸你

333
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,880
These thoughts that are coming
那些出现在你头脑中的思维

334
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,840
to you have no meaning with you

335
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,760
They do not substantiate you yourself

336
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,120
you are an ocean
你自己就是一个海洋

337
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:18,760
And you have to get into that
state of thoughtless awareness
你必须进入那无思虑的觉醒状态

338
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,960
It is always described in all the great books
这种状态在一切伟大的著作中通常都有所描述

339
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,600
but not so clearly as I am telling you
但却没有我告诉你们的这样清楚

340
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,974
I don't say
我不是说那些

341
00:30:29,189 --> 00:30:33,456
that some of you do not get thoughtless
awareness so they are good for nothing
未达到无思虑状态的人一无是处

342
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:34,526
- no
不是那样

343
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:42,080
But please try. You can all get into
that state of thoughtless awareness
但请尝试一番 你们全都可以进入无思虑的觉醒

344
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,360
even for a second ,if you get it
即便是一秒 若你们这样想

345
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,400
it's a very good idea
那是个不错的主意

346
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:54,263
Then you go on increasing that second
然后你可以继续延长那一秒

347
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,600
I think is a reflecting mind
我想这是一种反映式的大脑

348
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:10,120
When you look at something ,you
do become thoughtlessly aware
当你看到什么 你便变得无思虑

349
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:21,400
and then your mind reflects to
the depth of what you see
然后你的大脑反映出你所见到的深度

350
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,480
That's how you all will become

really very creative Sahaja yogis
极富创造力的霎哈嘉瑜伽士的方式

352
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:39,120
What I find that this state of thoughtless
awareness is not established by many
我发现 并没有太多人建立了无思虑的觉醒状态

353
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,920
which is not good
这并不好

354
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,897
Today, on this day of Diwali I would say
今天在光明节这个日子 我要说

355
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:50,320
that you enlighten yourself with
thoughtless awareness
你们要通过无思虑的觉醒来开悟你们自己

356
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,800
It is not difficult, it's within you
这并不难 它就在你们内在

357
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,920
because thoughts are coming
from this side and that side
因为思虑是来自这边和那边

358
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,600
And they are not the waves of your brain, no

359
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,360
just your own reactions

360
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,501
But in case you meditate in the
real sense of the word

361
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,160
then you'll get into that thoughtless awareness

362
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,680
which is a very important point

363
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,080
And all these nonsensical thoughts

364
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,640
which are of no use to you will disappear

and you'll grow very well

'Mother, we don't get that state'

Try. Try that

370
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,200
I don't believe you cannot get it

All of you can get that thought
that 'I can get it'
你们所有人都可以有这个心念"我能达到"

372
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,520
And you will get it

373
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,960
In that, you don't have to
discard anything
