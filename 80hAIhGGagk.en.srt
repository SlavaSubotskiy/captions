1
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:33,950
Today you all have decided to have the puja
of Adi Shakti.

2
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:42,130
There’s a difference between doing the puja
of Kundalini Shakti or Adi Kundalini and Adi

3
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,130
Shakti.

4
00:00:43,130 --> 00:01:00,480
The difference is like this, on one side the
Kundalini is reflected in you by Adi Kundalini.

5
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:08,380
The second side is the power of Adi Shakti
which is Paramchaitanya.

6
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:20,240
So in totality if you see, it has two sides:
one is Her power as Paramchaitanya and also

7
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:30,990
reflection in human beings as Kundalini.

8
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:38,920
The third work that Adi Shakti had to do was
to create this whole universe.

9
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:48,270
To begin with, as you have seen yesterday
also, how the cosmos was created and then

10
00:01:48,270 --> 00:02:00,490
how this special planet of Mother Earth was
created.

11
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:10,040
Now what I have told you about Adam and Eve
we have found out said by also John in his

12
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,640
Gnostics book.

13
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,410
It is very surprising.

14
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,230
They’ve always told you that Christ must
have told you many things but they are not

15
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,880
in the Bible.

16
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:30,790
So if you understand that this Adi Shakti
came as a serpent, the Adi Kundalini part

17
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:48,900
of Her, and told the Adam and Eve, especially
Eve, that she should ask for the fruit of

18
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,280
knowledge to be eaten.

19
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:59,560
And the reason I gave you is exactly the thing
there; that the Mother power, the feminine

20
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,870
power didn’t want Her children to live like
animals without understanding what is the

21
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:14,330
knowledge of the higher realms, not giving
them chance to rise higher through their freedom

22
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:22,480
and then to higher and higher awareness.

23
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,710
It was the concern of the Mother.

24
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:34,630
So there were two types of worlds were created:
one was the Divine and another one started

25
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,710
evolving.

26
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:44,620
To look at it looks very tremendous task thousands
of thousands, billions and billions of years,

27
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:55,570
have passed for this kind of a work to be
done.

28
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:03,870
But if you see in modern age we are going
to the moon, at such a small, with such a

29
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:14,079
small effort and also with, with such a little
time you reach there.

30
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,320
Nobody could think that we ever be there.

31
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,730
All this is happened through the human brain.

32
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,949
Now what is the human brain after all?

33
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:35,720
Human brain is not at all anywhere near the
brain of the [Bharat?] nor is this used fully,

34
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,729
it’s not used fully.

35
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:44,259
It’s very little bit is used by human beings,
by which they have achieved this kind of a

36
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:45,669
flight to moon.

37
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:50,099
Of course there was no purpose in it, I don’t
know why they are doing it.

38
00:04:50,099 --> 00:05:00,889
But they did it.

39
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:04,270
So the whole nature was created by Her.

40
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:12,289
Whatever you see today around yourself is
all created by Her, is all Her work that is

41
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:13,289
there.

42
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:20,600
You’ll be amazed, just now I said I was
going to wear a very heavy sari and I said

43
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,490
it’s very hot so better change to a simple
sari so I changed and when I came out I found

44
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,400
it has become cooler.

45
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:41,360
So the nature knows everything and who informs
the nature is this Paramchaitanya.

46
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,180
Paramchaitanya was never that active which
has started since My birth, I should say,

47
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,409
when Krita Yuga started.

48
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:56,199
At this time you had to have your realisation.

49
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:02,069
That was decided by the Divine collectivity
you can call it.

50
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:08,520
All the Gods, Goddesses, all of them decided
to put this work on somebody who thought,

51
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,270
whom they thought to be very capable.

52
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:21,009
So They said We all will be with You, entirely
with You, all Our powers will be with You

53
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:29,189
but You take up this job now in this Kali
Yuga to transform human beings.

54
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:37,129
In a way human beings are more difficult than
animals because they have their own freedom

55
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:43,409
and they have been given this freedom to achieve
their final freedom.

56
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:51,270
In their freedom, the way they behave, is
something very surprising how they go completely

57
00:06:51,270 --> 00:07:00,719
out of control and try to do things which
are so destructive.

58
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:05,999
Of course in Kali Yuga it was predicted in
India but I think they could not predict what

59
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:11,469
would happen in America or what would happen
in the Western countries where people have

60
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:21,409
freedom just to destroy themselves and they’re
finding new methods of destroying themselves.

61
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:32,680
This tendency cannot be curbed, cannot be
stopped by Adi Shakti or by God Almighty because

62
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,340
you have been given the freedom to ruin yourselves,
spoil yourselves and to go to hell.

63
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,590
That cannot be controlled by any Divine power.

64
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,870
Divine power also respects your freedom.

65
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:57,580
So the Divine collectivity thought, are We
going to completely ruin the creation of Adi

66
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,800
Shakti.

67
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:09,289
Are We going to completely destroy whatever
She has created and then re-create something

68
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,639
better, this was the discussion going on.

69
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:21,639
And most of Them were so fed up with the human
beings, especially with the Western freedom

70
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,740
that They said these people want help.

71
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:33,719
And why should We give them the Heavens, it’s
not proper.

72
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,830
So first thing Adi Shakti did was to create
a seeking in them.

73
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:45,830
She created it, this desire to seek.

74
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:52,720
And so these people belonging to this culture
which was so destructive started seeking.

75
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,760
And when the seeking started, also, as usual
in the market there were many others who came

76
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,230
forward to demand [answers/substance?] to
their seeking.

77
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:08,730
They had to go to various cults and things
and false people and all that because they

78
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,540
had no way to know.

79
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:24,550
But if they had read some books of enlightened
people like Kabir, like Nanak, even Gnostics,

80
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:31,570
their scriptures, anything like that, they
would have understood what is the truth and

81
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,829
where to find it and how to find it.

82
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:48,450
It is a big struggle I find between the people
who are seekers and those who are not at all

83
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,450
seekers.

84
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,899
They don’t want to know and they can never
be seekers.

85
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:59,199
I can assure you that some of them will never
think of seeking.

86
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,901
They’ll get possessed, they’ll have diseases,
they’ll have earthquakes, they’ll have

87
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:10,290
anything, they will never seek.

88
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:16,430
Even if they get diseases, they’ll say “Oh,
we are martyrs, we’re doing great work”.

89
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:23,389
Such stupidity has come into their heads that
they think that by doing these wrong things,

90
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:27,440
we are going to be saved.

91
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,970
And this stupidity comes through perverted
brains.

92
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,620
And this perverted brain acts when people
are free to use.

93
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:46,009
I just don’t know why don’t they see around
and see for themselves what is happening.

94
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:52,250
So to expect that the whole world will go
to Heaven is absolutely not possible, it’s

95
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,420
not possible, it cannot.

96
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,120
They have tried all kinds of things.

97
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,139
I’ve seen people ah drugs, alcohol, this,
that.

98
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:10,680
There is one fellow who got his PhD on writing
how he reached spirituality through drinking

99
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,980
and they gave him PhD for that.

100
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:21,130
So even at the helm of affairs in the universities,
I don’t know how such stupid people came

101
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,140
up, from where, out of which creation.

102
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:32,160
It’s impossible to understand how could
they think that this kind of destruction will

103
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,589
lead them to their salvation.

104
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:36,640
They see it everyday.

105
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,690
They watch it everyday.

106
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,420
They know it, it’s happening but still they
cannot listen.

107
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:52,100
But those who are seekers are so ardently
seeking that they will all have to be given

108
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,980
their self-realisation.

109
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,570
Now this is of course My job I agree.

110
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,889
I have come on this earth for that job.

111
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,510
I am suppose to do it.

112
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:10,630
I am trying my level best and no incarnation
has lived like I have lived for so many years

113
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:19,449
and such compassion of Mine which really makes
Me think that I feel we have to have many

114
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:27,610
more sahaja yogis, we have to have big salvation.

115
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:37,480
With that compassion and with that love, one
can take to any measures, anything.

116
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,800
I do not think those who are not seekers will
achieve it.

117
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,350
Now why is it some are seekers and some are
not?

118
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:52,910
One may say that Adi Shakti if She has created
all the human beings, all of them should have

119
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,259
seeking.

120
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:00,319
Because in freedom, they have lost their way.

121
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:03,250
They are seeking something else.

122
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,839
And they think they’re right.

123
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,390
They have a right to think that they are right.

124
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,491
Even a stupid fellow, even a mad person thinks
he's right.

125
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:17,200
If you tell him that you are mad, he’ll
say, you are mad.

126
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:26,630
And this seeking though put into them, they
are not yet capable, so many of them, of achieving

127
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,959
it in the proper way.

128
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:38,630
Because for that one has to surrender, not
one’s freedom, not one’s intelligence

129
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,960
but the ego that has developed in human beings.

130
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,709
With this ego even I’ve seen people who
are possessed, they want to keep their ego

131
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:55,029
intact and through the ego they want to use,
to use the possessions.

132
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:56,029
Can you imagine?

133
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:59,800
There are possessions of negative forces.

134
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:10,319
Such people want to keep that intact so that
they can use it for their own purpose.

135
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:14,980
They don’t hate it, they don’t want to
get rid of it.

136
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,920
But they want to keep it just because they
can use this possessions for their use.

137
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,670
So the category of seeking is much less there.

138
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:34,750
But there are many who are no where near seeking
who are really what we call them the evil

139
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:41,210
people and they never want, never never would
want that this world should change.

140
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,509
Our media is dominated by these evil people.

141
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,920
They don’t want world to change.

142
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,610
They don’t want to show anything that is
good.

143
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:56,480
They don’t want to see the point what is
going to help, what is benevolent for human

144
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
beings.

145
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:10,110
So on one side, we see
such collective search, collective negativity.

146
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,520
Another side we find seekers who are real
seekers.

147
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,800
There are some we can call as half-baked and
some are pseudo seekers.

148
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:35,269
If there, and in the name of seeking, if they
have done we can say some sort of a sacrifice

149
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:40,029
for them, they are very great.

150
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:47,350
Also they get involved with people who are
claiming.

151
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,540
Because I have never claimed anything, they
are not impressed by me.

152
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,160
I’ve not changed my dress.

153
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,709
I live like a housewife.

154
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:57,820
So they are not impressed by me.

155
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,939
I have not developed two [horns??] to show
something great about myself so they won’t

156
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:04,430
be impressed.

157
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:11,470
But on the other side if you see, this is
maya, this is Mahamaya where Adi Shakti you

158
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,980
see does everything like human beings do,
everything.

159
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,180
You won’t be able to find out that She is
Divine.

160
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:26,360
My family people could not find out till I
started this work, none of them, except for

161
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,620
my father and mother.

162
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:37,100
Nobody could find out that I had any powers.

163
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:46,550
Such insensitivity to Divine can be created
by Mahamaya power of Adi Shakti, which is

164
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:52,160
very important, otherwise you cannot judge,
you cannot understand.

165
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:59,970
Despite that, I’ve many times misjudged
people because they know how to camouflage

166
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,240
for a little while.

167
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,510
But then I discover.

168
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:15,060
If the seeking is ardent and they are seeking
really the truth, they will find it, they

169
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:19,959
will find it, no doubt because the whole creation
is for them.

170
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,589
The whole universe is for them.

171
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,660
All Dieties are for them.

172
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,290
All angels are for them.

173
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,730
They are all looking out for them.

174
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:39,770
This is important that we have so many sahaja
yogis.

175
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:46,170
Nobody had so many sahaja yogis in their lifetime.

176
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,970
Because we have to have channels.

177
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:56,900
I have to have channels and these channels
have to be very clean, have to be beautiful,

178
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,880
innocent and benevolent.

179
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:15,230
If only they surrender to this fact that we
are here for as the instrument of God Almighty

180
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:30,220
and that we have to give benevolence to others,
I tell you at least 70% of work is done.

181
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:41,990
But even if they have got realisation, like
an egg comes out of the shell, some of the

182
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:53,160
birds still carry the part of the egg and
some of them are not even grown up to be birds.

183
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,200
Now we have to judge ourselves.

184
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,820
We have to understand ourselves.

185
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:08,630
Another thing you know that, I’m a very
mild person, very mild.

186
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,100
People think I’m very forgiving.

187
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,140
I know everyone, not that I don’t.

188
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:20,540
But I allow alright, go ahead, as far as you
can go.

189
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,390
Experience is the only way a human being can
understand, no doubt.

190
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,760
If you tell him something, he will never understand.

191
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:36,050
Experience of self-realisation has made you
understand but again, I would say, that we

192
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:42,640
cannot give realisation to the whole world,
we cannot.

193
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,170
They’re like stones, absolutely horrible
people.

194
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:54,490
Whatever is happening is that those who are
false are getting exposed.

195
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:59,220
And everybody is noticing that that they are
getting exposed.

196
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,950
This exposure of course will save them from
these horrible people.

197
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:11,560
But I don’t know if they will come to Sahaja
Yoga or if they would take their realisation.

198
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:19,500
This I’m telling you because now I to have
experience of human beings and all these years

199
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:28,120
I have been working, I have seen that there
are people and people and people.

200
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:37,670
Out of them the seekers are extremely proud
of their seeking.

201
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:42,570
So some of them don’t want to give up their
seeking, it's, it’s kind of a job.

202
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,570
You can call it a hobby, they are seekers.

203
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:56,450
Now they have a certificate of being a seeker,
they wear funny dresses, have funny houses,

204
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,940
funny hair, everything, recluses they could
be, aggressive, anything, we are seekers.

205
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,580
They take a certificate upon themselves, we
are seekers.

206
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,820
This is another quality of seekers also.

207
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:17,440
They, for them it’s a kind of lifestyle,
they're seekers and wherever they have to

208
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,880
go, they will go for seeking, they’ll go
to 10 places, or 20 places.

209
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,920
Every time they have argued with me, Mother
there must be some more ways of, yes maybe,

210
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:35,500
I don’t know of any, you can know.

211
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,490
Now the main job of Adi Shakti today is to
give realisation.

212
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,440
That’s My main job.

213
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:51,060
All the rest is looked after, is already managed
I should say is like a computer.

214
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,520
I don’t have to work it, it’s a reflex
action.

215
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,990
Whatever is happening is in a reflex action.

216
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:05,600
I don’t have to worry about these things,
whether ah like people might say that, “Mother

217
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,260
I prayed to you and how is it you helped me
so much?”

218
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,680
It’s all reflex action.

219
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,900
That time maybe that thought may come to me,
thought, but it’s reflex action.

220
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,380
I really don’t do anything.

221
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,370
Actually, I’m a [Shria??].

222
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,740
Not doing anything whatsoever.

223
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:31,210
The laziest person you could think of is Me.

224
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:42,610
Really because if there's a complete organisation
working for Me why should I, why [there is

225
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,410
nothing necessary].

226
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:57,200
But one thing is there, I’m witnessing and
when I’m witnessing that acts on the reflex,

227
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,730
that works out, the Paramchaitanya.

228
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:13,390
Because if that is the power of the Adi Shakti
then whatever I witness gets reported to that

229
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,400
power.

230
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:23,120
It’s the other way round, like see we have
electricity power somewhere so something goes

231
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,210
wrong here, it is not reflected to that power.

232
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,850
It is not.

233
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,850
Something goes wrong, it finishes off here
and here.

234
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:39,700
But the other way round that if I witness
something wrong, I don’t have to do anything,

235
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:48,000
I just witness, I’m just watching, the whole
thing acts through this tremendous power of

236
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,860
Paramchaitanya.

237
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,790
Now this power you do not know.

238
00:23:54,790 --> 00:24:02,730
You know Kundalini, you know all about charkas
there, this, that, but this power of Paramchaitanya

239
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:15,520
is in every particle in you, every atom.

240
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:33,610
And it acts in such a manner that it directs,
it pushes you, it takes you to the path of

241
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,610
benevolence.

242
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:40,530
Sometimes people say, “Mother I wanted to
see to buy this shop, I couldn’t get it"

243
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,530
and all that.

244
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:45,270
It is for your benevolence you didn’t get,
thank God.

245
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:52,100
After 10 days they’ll come and say, thank
God I didn’t get it.

246
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:59,800
So gradually through experience, you start
understanding that you don’t have to worry.

247
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,920
If you are lost on the way, normally people
get very upset but sahaja yogis don’t, oh

248
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:12,230
very nice, must be something here that God
has brought us.

249
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:17,600
This action is like then changes.

250
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:29,760
I would say the person who is overactive,
starts thinking now, surrender, Islam, surrender.

251
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:41,120
Give this problem to this Paramchaitanya and
it works.

252
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:54,650
Such tremendous things have happened in this
world just by bandhans that it is unbelievable

253
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,840
how these things are happening.

254
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:07,710
Even supposing you find there are so many
murders, this thing has happened, that has

255
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,710
happened.

256
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:17,170
This is also just to express presence of Paramchaitanya,
it’s prutha, it’s working out.

257
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,890
The way it works.

258
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,650
Prutha means the one which is done.

259
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:35,170
Then you start realising that this power you
can achieve through your Kundalini.

260
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:43,300
So when your Kundalini rises, that is also
a reflection of Adi Shakti.

261
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:49,550
Like we can say, we see one part of moon,
the another part we don’t see.

262
00:26:49,550 --> 00:27:00,490
In the same way this power when rises within
you and touches this Paramchaitanya, then

263
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,340
you become empowered by that.

264
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:09,170
That’s how you are sahaja yogis.

265
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,580
But you are not God.

266
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:20,130
The incarnations can say, “Í am God”.

267
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,330
You are not incarnations.

268
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:35,940
But none of the incarnations have ever said
that they are Adi Shakti, cannot.

269
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:44,030
This power of Adi Shakti which we call Paramchaitanya
is the power that loves you, has complete

270
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,260
control of the nature.

271
00:27:46,260 --> 00:28:00,430
It understands, it thinks, it knows everything,
everything about you, it knows.

272
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:09,960
It works in every angle in every walk of your
life.

273
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:21,460
It is with you entirely as if supposing you
fall into a river which is flowing fast and

274
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:31,250
you cannot swim anymore, you cannot use your
hands anymore, you start flowing with it and

275
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:38,090
then you realise that flowing with it is a
better thing than to try to get out of it.

276
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:44,550
But just flowing with it, just enjoy all the
nature around you.

277
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,550
You don’t get drowned.

278
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:49,820
On the contrary, you feel you are elevated.

279
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:56,670
And you’re flowing with it, then you understand,
what am I to do about something, whether it’s

280
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:02,320
done by Paramchaitanya for me.

281
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,710
But that it should be given to your Kundalini
which has worked it out, has put you onto

282
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:18,820
that shore, has put you onto that beautiful
Heavenly Kingdom of God.

283
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:24,610
Thus, you understand there are two things
that have happened: that first, your Mother,

284
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:30,000
your Kundalini which is within you, which
is your own Mother, which has been with you

285
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,460
throughout, has given you this birth.

286
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:40,730
And then it has taken to that power, which
power you can use yourself.

287
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,190
You are empowered by that.

288
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,100
You’ll be amazed how this power helps.

289
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:57,060
I mean, you see, I shouldn’t say that you
can have all the powers, I shouldn’t say

290
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,060
that.

291
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,660
But today you see they were complaining about
somebody, immediately I told the name of the

292
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,660
person.

293
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,650
Now you’ll say, how I knew.

294
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,360
I just know.

295
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,503
That’s all I can say.

296
00:30:08,503 --> 00:30:10,910
I just know.

297
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:15,610
Supposing you are dealing with carpets, alright,
so you know what pattern is this, what pattern

298
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:23,140
is that, from where it has come, everything,
you know, isn’t it.

299
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,650
If you are there, you know everything.

300
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:34,510
If this power is everywhere, one has to know
everything, the connection is such.

301
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:39,940
If you want to know, you can know anything.

302
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:51,750
So they have called also Buddha as Avalokiteshvara
that He sees all the lotus How does He see,

303
00:30:51,750 --> 00:31:08,620
Avalokiteshvara, because His ego what we call
is the paramaego, Mahatahamkara, knows everything,

304
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:15,750
while your ego doesn’t know anything.

305
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:25,310
Because it doesn’t know anything, you are
enveloped by it.

306
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:33,000
If he had known, if the ego had known what
is the truth, you’ll be free person absolutely

307
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
free.

308
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,290
But you don’t want to surrender your ego.

309
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:44,270
You don’t want to allow yourself to flow
into the river as Tao, [??] we say.

310
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:51,150
No you don’t want to enjoy, you want to
have your own speciality.

311
00:31:51,150 --> 00:32:00,740
Individuality is very different from having
a kind of a ego within yourself that I am

312
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,690
this, I am that.

313
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:12,000
So this differentiation must start, after
realisation, in the light of realisation,

314
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,600
you should start seeing.

315
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:22,440
Now the first and foremost thing is to tell
your ego to sit down, keep quiet, you don’t

316
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,620
want.

317
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:29,950
And also in the modern times it’s a big
fashion you ask somebody, “I don’t know”.

318
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,400
You ask somebody, what’s your name, “I
don’t know”.

319
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,890
He doesn’t even know his name.

320
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:44,660
And to be stupid is a fashion.

321
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,250
To show that you are very stupid they think
they are showing they’re very innocent.

322
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,280
It’s not, it’s a stupidity.

323
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,520
This stupidity, I don’t know which animal
has.

324
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,650
Still I don’t know what is the source of
it.

325
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:01,610
Still I’ll have to find out.

326
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:04,590
Who is the animal that has generated this
stupidity in them.

327
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:10,770
But I know one thing, it is our ego.

328
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:15,380
Ego makes a person absolutely stupid.

329
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:24,450
In Marathi, you see, thank God, language is
so rich, that anybody who starts showing off

330
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:32,210
his ego, they say his climbing on a bush,
there is a little bush and he is climbing

331
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,770
on that.

332
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:46,790
All this ego comes through your own so called
ideas, achievements.

333
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:50,810
But what are these achievements.

334
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:55,780
You don’t know anything.

335
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:01,430
And this is what today I have to tell you
that if anything is working out today, is

336
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:05,680
your surrender of your ego.

337
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,530
If you know how to surrender your ego, you’ll
work it out.

338
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:15,760
Another thing which surprises me sometimes,
in the West specially, that I think that the

339
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,230
women are the power are the Shakti.

340
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:30,179
But in the West I find women are not using
Adi Shakti, no.

341
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:45,519
Firstly, they are still very much possessed
by their emotions and by their ideas and things

342
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,770
like that.

343
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,679
One side is man, who is doing everything.

344
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,460
But even women are very egoistical, very much.

345
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,349
It’s very difficult.

346
00:34:55,349 --> 00:35:04,960
For example, you marry some girl, Western
girl, to somebody, she’ll be very happy,

347
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:12,760
jumping, taking all the presents, congratulations,
wearing all dress, everything.

348
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,369
After 10 days, she’ll come and say, “Mother
I’m confused”.

349
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:19,080
Confused, how?

350
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,630
“I’m now confused”.

351
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,420
You’re confused now or before.

352
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,769
“I’m now confused”.

353
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:26,769
Alright.

354
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:27,769
You return all your ornaments and everything.

355
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:31,859
“No, no then let me think”.

356
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:38,200
This is not the level of a sahaja yogini.

357
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:46,660
Sahaja yogini is the Shakti and she has to
take up challenges, I’ll show you, I’ll

358
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,290
do it better.

359
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:56,460
On the contrary I find them extremely dominating,
I’m amazed, why should Shakti dominate.

360
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,910
If she’s Shakti, she’ll not dominate.

361
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,310
Those who are not will dominate.

362
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:10,480
Like you see you go in India to any collector’s
house, the collector will be humble but the

363
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,020
constable would be dominating.

364
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:21,670
In the same way, I find, this domination business
is very common.

365
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:29,319
And also a kind of a temperament of like a
nun.

366
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:33,359
They’ll dress up like a nun, behave like
a nun.

367
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,710
They won’t smile.

368
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,710
What is?

369
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,740
Are you sahaja yoginis?

370
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,509
Or what are you, are you nuns?

371
00:36:40,509 --> 00:36:41,920
Then better join nunnery.

372
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:48,079
Why I’m telling you while talking about
Adi Shakti so I’m talking about Shakti,

373
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,930
how the Shakti has to come up.

374
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:56,009
I was surprised that women were not spreading
Sahaja Yoga.

375
00:36:56,009 --> 00:36:59,420
Somebody told me that the leaders do not want
women to spread Sahaja Yoga.

376
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,420
This is wrong.

377
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,619
If the leaders say that, it’s not proper.

378
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:14,589
But first of all the sahaja yoginis have to
be real sahaja yoginis because so far I’ve

379
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:21,359
seen anybody is, you try to give any lady,
try to give her the position of a leader,

380
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,150
she just finishes off the thing.

381
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:30,099
Not all, but some.

382
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:45,640
Now the duty of a sahaja yogini is to develop
herself through meditation, through understanding

383
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:54,970
oneself and through self-esteem that I’m
a sahaja yogini, I’m the one who is Shakti,

384
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,579
I’m the potential of that.

385
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,529
I’m the potential myself.

386
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:00,890
What do I do, nothing?

387
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:05,579
I didn’t do like this, I didn’t put this
on, nothing of the kind.

388
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:09,380
I’m nice visiting and talking.

389
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,690
But potential, am I the potential?

390
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:19,549
This is what the sahaja yoginis have to decide.

391
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:27,839
Otherwise, they’re possessed, they're day
dreaming, thinking no end of themselves.

392
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,150
It’s very difficult.

393
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:36,700
I want some nice sahaja yoginis to be the
leaders, I really want.

394
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:44,130
But as soon as they become leader, they are
on a horse, running so fast.

395
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:48,720
So humble downwards.

396
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:57,029
Unless and until there’s a big space in
the pitcher what water can flow into it.

397
00:38:57,029 --> 00:38:59,730
Have a very large heart.

398
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:06,540
Anybody comes to your house, you don’t like
it, don’t want to do anything for other

399
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,920
sahaja yogis, looking after them.

400
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:17,349
It is really again and again I say in the
West, that women have to take up Shakti unto

401
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:18,349
themselves.

402
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:21,770
And Shakti doesn’t mean dominate your husband
and make a fool out of him.

403
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:26,380
No, it means give him powers.

404
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,890
You are the supply of power of the whole family.

405
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,670
And this is our family.

406
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,130
All this is my family.

407
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,960
I’m so concerned about everyone.

408
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,670
Even the little thing I’m bothered about.

409
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:46,219
I’m never satisfied that I’ve done my
job now and I can now tonight I’ll go off

410
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:48,460
to sleep and not think of anyone.

411
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,730
Never.

412
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,240
I’m concerned about this, I’m concerned
about that.

413
00:39:53,240 --> 00:40:03,070
All the time it’s flowing, this power, and
My concern this power that works because My

414
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,130
concern is genuine.

415
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,579
I’m not concerned about Myself, never.

416
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:16,900
You’ll be amazed when I see all these women
doing all kinds of things to themselves, I’m

417
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,900
surprised.

418
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,160
What is needed is the concern.

419
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:29,950
And once you develop that concern, a genuine,
loving, compassionate concern about others.

420
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:34,680
Even about children, I’ve seen that, they
never look after each other’s children.

421
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,150
They never help others.

422
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:42,519
Somebody had to go for taking out the tooth,
she had to carry the child with her.

423
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:44,759
This is true.

424
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:50,859
If you do not have concern, then you’ll
not have collective mind, you’ll not have

425
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:53,470
the collective power.

426
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:59,240
And it’s important that you all should try
to be very collective, look after each other’s.

427
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,499
Now I shouldn’t say this, I was going to
tell it to Cabella ladies, that this house

428
00:41:04,499 --> 00:41:10,710
in Cabella is an ashram and those people who
come from other ashrams, even from Australia,

429
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:14,490
are surprised, that they are all living here
just like a hotel.

430
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:20,470
They’re paying for it, we all pay but we
have gardens, we look after the gardens, we

431
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,210
look after the outside.

432
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,430
Here nobody’s bothered.

433
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:29,170
They’re using everything, not bothered.

434
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:33,869
Surprisingly why when I’m living here, they
are like this.

435
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:39,049
You go to any place in Australia, you go to
America, anywhere, wherever there’s an ashram,

436
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:42,680
they all work on Sundays.

437
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,680
Here I’ve not seen.

438
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,680
They all disappear.

439
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,140
This is your ashram.

440
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,450
You are staying here.

441
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:56,259
And is now today I have to tell this because
I feel that Sahaja Yoga is missing out itself

442
00:41:56,259 --> 00:41:59,670
on their Shaktis.

443
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:05,859
Some of them do not know how to smiling, And
some of them are extremely dominating.

444
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:09,609
I have to tell you this because you are so
important.

445
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:12,650
But for Me, no man would have done this job.

446
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,480
No man incarnation would have done this job.

447
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,440
Christ, he get crucified at a young age, very
nice.

448
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:27,650
Get crucified at such a young age, then another
one takes to poison, another one is killed

449
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,650
by somebody.

450
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:32,029
It’s like that, they all died very young.

451
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:38,049
Nobody wanted to do this work, nobody was,
I mean, they got fed up.

452
00:42:38,049 --> 00:42:39,420
Got fed up.

453
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:44,931
We had Ganeshwara who went into Samadhi at
the age of 23 years, can you imagine.

454
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:48,520
He must have been fed up with the people.

455
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:56,170
Now it is for you people, the ladies, have
to develop that patience of your Mother, that

456
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:02,530
affection, that love and then you will see
how your Shakti will work out.

457
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:06,680
I again and again always have talked about
this.

458
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:14,710
And at Adi Shakti point, I have to say you
are in your family like a Shakti.

459
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:17,940
And you have to be wise, you have to be sensible.

460
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,809
You have to understand your husband.

461
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:21,500
You have to understand your children.

462
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,119
You have to have patience.

463
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,260
On the contrary, they spoil their children.

464
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:34,020
That is to be understood, that you must know
first what is good for their benevolence.

465
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:41,480
Today for example, if I say the children if
they go to a school, they should not be removed.

466
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,730
It is for their benevolence.

467
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,589
What are the people going to gain out of it.

468
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:48,420
So somebody says no.

469
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,440
Alright, get out.

470
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,640
What can you do?

471
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:01,200
Such attachment to your own children shows
you are a powerless person.

472
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:08,190
You must love all the children, you must look
after all the children, you must enjoy all

473
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,970
the children, take interest.

474
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:18,499
But what I find that they are only interested
in their own children.

475
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:20,339
We are a joint family.

476
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:22,770
We live together.

477
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:27,490
We have to share everything.

478
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:31,420
It is something I can’t understand.

479
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:40,690
Say, our, in India, say, if you see 5, 6 children,
all the girls will run after them.

480
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:42,180
All the women will look after them.

481
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:48,529
I mean, it’s such a pleasure to them, to
any children, just to look after them.

482
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:59,020
But this kind of insensitivity to your collective
behaviour is going to also spoil your children.

483
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:10,630
So what you are going to transmit to the whole
world is this Sahaja living and the women

484
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:12,060
make the society.

485
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:17,869
If Indian society is good, the credit goes
to the Indian women and their wisdom.

486
00:45:17,869 --> 00:45:19,299
Men are stupid in India.

487
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,940
They spoil politics, economics, everything.

488
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:32,819
But society is still maintained and they are
very very still say on the right path.

489
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:36,869
This only comes because of the wisdom of the
women.

490
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:42,470
If the women are busy dressing up for hours
together, thinking about their clothes, what

491
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:49,069
they’re going to wear, finished.

492
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:59,980
This is a day of worshipping the Kundalini
who is the Mother.

493
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,230
She is the Mother.

494
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,880
And you are the mother.

495
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,440
You must know each and everything about your
child.

496
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,849
Somebody comes and tells me, “My child is
now a drug addict”.

497
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:12,900
How can that be possible?

498
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,359
In India children, don’t get drug addicts
because all the time the mother is on their

499
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:21,480
head like a hawk.

500
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,089
She knows where he goes, what he does, she
loves.

501
00:46:25,089 --> 00:46:27,849
But she knows, very well.

502
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:34,950
Even when we are in college, even when I'm
married, we went home, my mother would ask,

503
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,039
“Where did you go?

504
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:40,599
Did I not say, come back by 6”.

505
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:41,930
Even when we are married.

506
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:47,869
And we are suppose to tell her.

507
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:49,910
That was the mother’s work.

508
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:55,460
The child where he goes, what does he do,
and then to say children don’t listen to

509
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,460
me.

510
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:02,579
Because why the children do not listen, because
you do not discipline them.

511
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:08,819
Here the atmosphere is very bad agreed, and
the children are very bad, agreed.

512
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:11,250
Everything is there, agreed.

513
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:18,569
But if you are a strong mother in your love,
your children will not wander.

514
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:24,519
See, even now as you know that, all the time
there are all these leaders are hovering around

515
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:26,069
Me, what is there.

516
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:29,900
I have no honey with me or anything but they
are just sitting there, just sitting next

517
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:33,050
to Me, all the leaders.

518
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:41,930
But this is after realisation but My even
all My nephews you see, they would all come

519
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:49,799
and sit next to Me, all My in, daughter-in-laws
they would sit next to Me, they would not

520
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:50,799
leave Me.

521
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:53,759
And people will start saying, what’s wrong
with you, you're all the time sticking on

522
00:47:53,759 --> 00:47:57,299
to your aunt, what is it?

523
00:47:57,299 --> 00:48:08,619
The concern and they understand that it is
for their benevolence you are telling them.

524
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:11,599
But yourself should be alright.

525
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:17,420
As a mother one has to be tolerant, one has
to understand but when you have to tell them

526
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,230
you have to tell them.

527
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:27,190
If you think you can tell them sharply or
maybe in a proper way but the child should

528
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:33,890
know that you love the child and that you
love all the children.

529
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,490
It is very subtle.

530
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:44,079
Like I've seen, once I took a child of one
sahaja yogi with Me to the market, he was

531
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,339
asking "I'll buy this, I'll buy that,[I]’ll
buy that", everything he wanted to buy.

532
00:48:49,339 --> 00:48:52,460
I was wondering What's wrong with this boy.

533
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:57,539
But say if I take my own grandchildren, they
won't buy, nothing.

534
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:00,900
Even if you want to buy two pairs of shoes,
"No, no, no, one is sufficient".

535
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,140
If this will be then only.

536
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,749
They'll never ask for anything.

537
00:49:03,749 --> 00:49:10,079
It's a kind of a self-esteem.

538
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,319
They don't want anything.

539
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:13,460
Same with the wives.

540
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:19,079
Wives never ask for anything from their husband,
nothing.

541
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:20,180
Nothing.

542
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,609
The husband will go on asking, please ask
for something, ask for something.

543
00:49:24,609 --> 00:49:28,369
No, they don't want anything.

544
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:34,579
That is going to be a sahaja yogini mother
and a wife and a shakti.

545
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:38,609
She has no demands.

546
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:42,230
Nothing she's asking for.

547
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:47,109
The one who's a giver, what is she going to
ask.

548
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:53,279
The one who is a supplier, what is she going
to ask.

549
00:49:53,279 --> 00:50:01,010
So I feel sometimes that the left side, the
women side in Sahaja Yoga is a little bit

550
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:03,619
going down.

551
00:50:03,619 --> 00:50:04,700
And they have to come up.

552
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:11,410
First, meditation, the respect of Mother,
teaching the children how to work out Sahaja

553
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:22,940
Yoga, talking to them about Sahaja Yoga and
not only about food, of cleanliness, of being

554
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:29,530
nice to others, how to share things.

555
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:36,029
And telling children about good stories that
you have heard about.

556
00:50:36,029 --> 00:50:40,539
Telling them what is dharma is, talking to
them.

557
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:42,630
Having a rapport.

558
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:49,160
This is what you have to understand to make
Sahaja Yoga very strong.

559
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,559
You are the Shakti of Sahaja Yoga take it
from Me.

560
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:56,819
And you have to work it out that way.

561
00:50:56,819 --> 00:51:00,140
Instead of worrying about small, small things.

562
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:08,150
Some times I receive letters from the ladies,
sometimes, it really pains me.

563
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:15,410
I can't understand how they are sahaja yogis.

564
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:26,180
Our whole system of Sahaja has to be a moral
system that others should see and understand

565
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:32,779
that what we have achieved in our day to day
life.

566
00:51:32,779 --> 00:51:40,239
Adi Shakti works in day to day life, the smallest
things to the highest.

567
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:44,040
And all the time you have to learn, all the
time you have to learn.

568
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,349
Whether you are a leader or not a leader,
all the time you must know what it is you

569
00:51:48,349 --> 00:51:49,920
have to know.

570
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,069
I have not known this, I have not known that.

571
00:51:54,069 --> 00:52:00,069
Unless and until you develop that kind of
an attitude that I have to learn that you

572
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:07,030
humble attitude, that humility, I have to
learn, I have to learn, still I have to learn,

573
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:09,940
this ego will never come.

574
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:14,079
Because of this ego you are satisfied with
yourself, that's the sign of an ego.

575
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:19,829
You don't know how much you are torturing
others, what you are destroying, nothing.

576
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:24,759
But you feel extremely happy with yourself.

577
00:52:24,759 --> 00:52:37,780
Such a happy go lucky personality sometimes
is living on air.

578
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:45,029
What I have done today for somebody else,
how have I talked to somebody else, what have

579
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:47,049
I given to somebody else.

580
00:52:47,049 --> 00:52:52,999
I need not give you presents, there's nothing,
why should I give you presents.

581
00:52:52,999 --> 00:52:56,609
But I give you presents because of My own
satisfaction.

582
00:52:56,609 --> 00:53:04,500
And if I take presents from you, it is for
your own satisfaction.

583
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:14,069
So what we have to do, in what we find satisfaction,
what do we find satisfaction, just think about

584
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:17,660
it, what do we find satisfaction in.

585
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:25,309
My house should be alright, my husband should
be alright, my children should be alright,

586
00:53:25,309 --> 00:53:29,039
my, my, my.

587
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:43,890
Unless and until this my shifts to another
person, you are still in the realm of maya.

588
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:53,579
You have to learn this is to think everyday
or write, all of you should write diaries,

589
00:53:53,579 --> 00:54:06,190
what have I done for others, what have I said
to others, what will make or please another

590
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:07,200
person.

591
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:16,380
Small, small things can make the life so beautiful.

592
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:21,109
And also very big things there are for you.

593
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:27,839
If you do not think, if you do not think you
are very big, all these big things are also

594
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,779
for you.

595
00:54:29,779 --> 00:54:45,839
It's like this, this whole sky can be covered
by one leaf if you see the leaf against the

596
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,480
sky, the leaf shows it’s existence.

597
00:54:48,480 --> 00:55:03,489
In the same way, this whole vision of Sahaja
Yoga can be completely covered by one person

598
00:55:03,489 --> 00:55:16,130
who stands with this great expanse, one person
here and one person there.

599
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:18,880
It's so remarkable.

600
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,359
It's such a lot of Sahaja Yoga.

601
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:28,200
There are people who are here and there and
there, so remarkable that if you take their

602
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:38,599
names also, I just feel I'm drenched into
the ocean of joy.

603
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:44,420
Only one person, then what about you?

604
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:48,339
Why can't we do that.

605
00:55:48,339 --> 00:55:57,559
When Adi Shakti is with you reflected when
all Her powers are with you, how much we can

606
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:05,279
do in this expanse of My vision.

607
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:19,310
I want to have more and more people who will
be of some visions themselves.

608
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:23,849
But not small people who just think of their
children, think of food.

609
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:25,549
No, no, they are not wanted, useless.

610
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:26,759
They will all drop out.

611
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:44,049
I hope you have understood where you are,
what do you have, what is created within you

612
00:56:44,049 --> 00:56:48,420
is this Kundalini which has given you all
the knowledge and everything.

613
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:53,200
But there are so many I know who don't even
know what is this chakra, they don't know,

614
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,589
I mean going to that limit of ignorance.

615
00:56:56,589 --> 00:57:00,049
You have to know all these things.

616
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:13,890
You have to understand what it is because
this is for you, all for you, all this knowledge.

617
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:19,140
And the greatest of all is the faith.

618
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:25,460
Not a faith which is blind but enlightened
faith that you are now one with that Divine

619
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:28,740
power.

620
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,999
This should really settle you completely.

621
00:57:30,999 --> 00:57:42,500
This is I think that this is one of the most
important pujas because so far guru pujas

622
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,430
have been there, so many people have worshipped
those gurus.

623
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:51,049
Or maybe My birthday as you think it be, it's
alright.

624
00:57:51,049 --> 00:58:00,839
But I think to understand your own powers
of Kundalini and your powers that are available

625
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:08,039
to you to the working of Paramchaitanya is
very important.

626
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:13,069
That will give you confidence, that'll give
you compassion, that'll give you a vision

627
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:18,799
and that will make you a very great personality,
a very great personality.

628
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,049
What was George Washington?

629
00:58:21,049 --> 00:58:23,869
They said he was great.

630
00:58:23,869 --> 00:58:25,180
What was Abraham Lincoln.

631
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,990
He was great.

632
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:32,690
But you are all having your self-realisation.

633
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:38,790
You have to think of the whole universe, the
whole expanse unless and until that brain

634
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:48,269
develops in you, I'm sure very sure that the
progress of Sahaja Yoga within and without

635
00:58:48,269 --> 00:58:49,930
will be less.

636
00:58:49,930 --> 00:59:17,990
So understand these powers are with you.

637
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:24,569
You have to utilise them, with humility.

638
00:59:24,569 --> 00:59:30,750
May God bless you.

639
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,299
