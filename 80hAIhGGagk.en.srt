1
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:31,456
Today you all have decided to have the puja
of Adi Shakti.

2
00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:39,636
There’s a difference between doing the puja
of Kundalini Shakti or Adi Kundalini and Adi

3
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:40,636
Shakti.

4
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:57,986
The difference is like this, on one side the
Kundalini is reflected in you by Adi Kundalini.

5
00:00:57,986 --> 00:01:05,886
The second side is the power of Adi Shakti
which is Paramchaitanya.

6
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:17,746
So in totality if you see, it has two sides:
one is Her power as Paramchaitanya and also

7
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:28,496
reflection in human beings as Kundalini.

8
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:36,426
The third work that Adi Shakti had to do was
to create this whole universe.

9
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:45,776
To begin with, as you have seen yesterday
also, how the cosmos was created and then

10
00:01:45,776 --> 00:01:57,996
how this special planet of Mother Earth was
created.

11
00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:07,546
Now what I have told you about Adam and Eve
we have found out said by also John in his

12
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:09,146
Gnostics book.

13
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:10,916
It is very surprising.

14
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:15,736
They’ve always told you that Christ must
have told you many things but they are not

15
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,386
in the Bible.

16
00:02:17,386 --> 00:02:28,296
So if you understand that this Adi Shakti
came as a serpent, the Adi Kundalini part

17
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:46,406
of Her, and told the Adam and Eve, especially
Eve, that she should ask for the fruit of

18
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:48,786
knowledge to be eaten.

19
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:57,066
And the reason I gave you is exactly the thing
there; that the Mother power, the feminine

20
00:02:57,066 --> 00:03:03,376
power didn’t want Her children to live like
animals without understanding what is the

21
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:11,836
knowledge of the higher realms, not giving
them chance to rise higher through their freedom

22
00:03:11,836 --> 00:03:19,986
and then to higher and higher awareness.

23
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:23,216
It was the concern of the Mother.

24
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:32,136
So there were two types of worlds were created:
one was the Divine and another one started

25
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:34,216
evolving.

26
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:42,126
To look at it looks very tremendous task thousands
of thousands, billions and billions of years,

27
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:53,076
have passed for this kind of a work to be
done.

28
00:03:53,076 --> 00:04:01,376
But if you see in modern age we are going
to the moon, at such a small, with such a

29
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:11,585
small effort and also with, with such a little
time you reach there.

30
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:15,826
Nobody could think that we ever be there.

31
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:20,236
All this is happened through the human brain.

32
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:23,455
Now what is the human brain after all?

33
00:04:23,455 --> 00:04:33,226
Human brain is not at all anywhere near the
brain of the [Bharat?] nor is this used fully,

34
00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:35,235
it’s not used fully.

35
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:41,765
It’s very little bit is used by human beings,
by which they have achieved this kind of a

36
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:43,175
flight to moon.

37
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:47,605
Of course there was no purpose in it, I don’t
know why they are doing it.

38
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:58,395
But they did it.

39
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:01,776
So the whole nature was created by Her.

40
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:09,795
Whatever you see today around yourself is
all created by Her, is all Her work that is

41
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:10,795
there.

42
00:05:10,795 --> 00:05:18,106
You’ll be amazed, just now I said I was
going to wear a very heavy sari and I said

43
00:05:18,106 --> 00:05:23,996
it’s very hot so better change to a simple
sari so I changed and when I came out I found

44
00:05:23,996 --> 00:05:28,906
it has become cooler.

45
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:38,866
So the nature knows everything and who informs
the nature is this Paramchaitanya.

46
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:45,686
Paramchaitanya was never that active which
has started since My birth, I should say,

47
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:47,915
when Krita Yuga started.

48
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:53,705
At this time you had to have your realisation.

49
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:59,575
That was decided by the Divine collectivity
you can call it.

50
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:06,026
All the Gods, Goddesses, all of them decided
to put this work on somebody who thought,

51
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:11,776
whom they thought to be very capable.

52
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:18,515
So They said We all will be with You, entirely
with You, all Our powers will be with You

53
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:26,695
but You take up this job now in this Kali
Yuga to transform human beings.

54
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:34,635
In a way human beings are more difficult than
animals because they have their own freedom

55
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:40,915
and they have been given this freedom to achieve
their final freedom.

56
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:48,776
In their freedom, the way they behave, is
something very surprising how they go completely

57
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:58,225
out of control and try to do things which
are so destructive.

58
00:06:58,225 --> 00:07:03,505
Of course in Kali Yuga it was predicted in
India but I think they could not predict what

59
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:08,975
would happen in America or what would happen
in the Western countries where people have

60
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:18,915
freedom just to destroy themselves and they’re
finding new methods of destroying themselves.

61
00:07:18,915 --> 00:07:30,186
This tendency cannot be curbed, cannot be
stopped by Adi Shakti or by God Almighty because

62
00:07:30,186 --> 00:07:36,846
you have been given the freedom to ruin yourselves,
spoil yourselves and to go to hell.

63
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:41,096
That cannot be controlled by any Divine power.

64
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:45,376
Divine power also respects your freedom.

65
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:55,086
So the Divine collectivity thought, are We
going to completely ruin the creation of Adi

66
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:56,306
Shakti.

67
00:07:56,306 --> 00:08:06,795
Are We going to completely destroy whatever
She has created and then re-create something

68
00:08:06,795 --> 00:08:11,145
better, this was the discussion going on.

69
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:19,145
And most of Them were so fed up with the human
beings, especially with the Western freedom

70
00:08:19,145 --> 00:08:23,246
that They said these people want help.

71
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:31,225
And why should We give them the Heavens, it’s
not proper.

72
00:08:31,225 --> 00:08:37,336
So first thing Adi Shakti did was to create
a seeking in them.

73
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:43,336
She created it, this desire to seek.

74
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:50,226
And so these people belonging to this culture
which was so destructive started seeking.

75
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:56,266
And when the seeking started, also, as usual
in the market there were many others who came

76
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:59,736
forward to demand [answers/substance?] to
their seeking.

77
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:06,236
They had to go to various cults and things
and false people and all that because they

78
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:09,046
had no way to know.

79
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:22,056
But if they had read some books of enlightened
people like Kabir, like Nanak, even Gnostics,

80
00:09:22,056 --> 00:09:29,076
their scriptures, anything like that, they
would have understood what is the truth and

81
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:33,335
where to find it and how to find it.

82
00:09:33,335 --> 00:09:45,956
It is a big struggle I find between the people
who are seekers and those who are not at all

83
00:09:45,956 --> 00:09:46,956
seekers.

84
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:51,405
They don’t want to know and they can never
be seekers.

85
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:56,705
I can assure you that some of them will never
think of seeking.

86
00:09:56,705 --> 00:10:01,407
They’ll get possessed, they’ll have diseases,
they’ll have earthquakes, they’ll have

87
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:07,796
anything, they will never seek.

88
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:13,936
Even if they get diseases, they’ll say “Oh,
we are martyrs, we’re doing great work”.

89
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:20,895
Such stupidity has come into their heads that
they think that by doing these wrong things,

90
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:24,946
we are going to be saved.

91
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:31,476
And this stupidity comes through perverted
brains.

92
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:37,126
And this perverted brain acts when people
are free to use.

93
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:43,515
I just don’t know why don’t they see around
and see for themselves what is happening.

94
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:49,756
So to expect that the whole world will go
to Heaven is absolutely not possible, it’s

95
00:10:49,756 --> 00:10:52,926
not possible, it cannot.

96
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:54,626
They have tried all kinds of things.

97
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:59,645
I’ve seen people ah drugs, alcohol, this,
that.

98
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:08,186
There is one fellow who got his PhD on writing
how he reached spirituality through drinking

99
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:11,486
and they gave him PhD for that.

100
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:18,636
So even at the helm of affairs in the universities,
I don’t know how such stupid people came

101
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,646
up, from where, out of which creation.

102
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:29,666
It’s impossible to understand how could
they think that this kind of destruction will

103
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,095
lead them to their salvation.

104
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:34,146
They see it everyday.

105
00:11:34,146 --> 00:11:36,196
They watch it everyday.

106
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:40,926
They know it, it’s happening but still they
cannot listen.

107
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:49,606
But those who are seekers are so ardently
seeking that they will all have to be given

108
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:51,486
their self-realisation.

109
00:11:51,486 --> 00:11:55,076
Now this is of course My job I agree.

110
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:57,395
I have come on this earth for that job.

111
00:11:57,395 --> 00:12:00,016
I am suppose to do it.

112
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:08,136
I am trying my level best and no incarnation
has lived like I have lived for so many years

113
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:16,955
and such compassion of Mine which really makes
Me think that I feel we have to have many

114
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:25,116
more sahaja yogis, we have to have big salvation.

115
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:34,986
With that compassion and with that love, one
can take to any measures, anything.

116
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:40,306
I do not think those who are not seekers will
achieve it.

117
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:43,856
Now why is it some are seekers and some are
not?

118
00:12:43,856 --> 00:12:50,416
One may say that Adi Shakti if She has created
all the human beings, all of them should have

119
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,765
seeking.

120
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:57,825
Because in freedom, they have lost their way.

121
00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:00,756
They are seeking something else.

122
00:13:00,756 --> 00:13:02,345
And they think they’re right.

123
00:13:02,345 --> 00:13:04,896
They have a right to think that they are right.

124
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:07,997
Even a stupid fellow, even a mad person thinks
he's right.

125
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:14,706
If you tell him that you are mad, he’ll
say, you are mad.

126
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:24,136
And this seeking though put into them, they
are not yet capable, so many of them, of achieving

127
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:28,465
it in the proper way.

128
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:36,136
Because for that one has to surrender, not
one’s freedom, not one’s intelligence

129
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:40,466
but the ego that has developed in human beings.

130
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:45,215
With this ego even I’ve seen people who
are possessed, they want to keep their ego

131
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:52,535
intact and through the ego they want to use,
to use the possessions.

132
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:53,535
Can you imagine?

133
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,306
There are possessions of negative forces.

134
00:13:57,306 --> 00:14:07,825
Such people want to keep that intact so that
they can use it for their own purpose.

135
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:12,486
They don’t hate it, they don’t want to
get rid of it.

136
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:18,426
But they want to keep it just because they
can use this possessions for their use.

137
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:23,176
So the category of seeking is much less there.

138
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:32,256
But there are many who are no where near seeking
who are really what we call them the evil

139
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:38,716
people and they never want, never never would
want that this world should change.

140
00:14:38,716 --> 00:14:42,015
Our media is dominated by these evil people.

141
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,426
They don’t want world to change.

142
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:47,116
They don’t want to show anything that is
good.

143
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:53,986
They don’t want to see the point what is
going to help, what is benevolent for human

144
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:54,986
beings.

145
00:14:54,986 --> 00:15:07,616
So on one side, we see
such collective search, collective negativity.

146
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:12,026
Another side we find seekers who are real
seekers.

147
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:18,306
There are some we can call as half-baked and
some are pseudo seekers.

148
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:32,775
If there, and in the name of seeking, if they
have done we can say some sort of a sacrifice

149
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:37,535
for them, they are very great.

150
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:44,856
Also they get involved with people who are
claiming.

151
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:49,046
Because I have never claimed anything, they
are not impressed by me.

152
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:50,666
I’ve not changed my dress.

153
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,215
I live like a housewife.

154
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:55,326
So they are not impressed by me.

155
00:15:55,326 --> 00:16:00,445
I have not developed two [horns??] to show
something great about myself so they won’t

156
00:16:00,445 --> 00:16:01,936
be impressed.

157
00:16:01,936 --> 00:16:08,976
But on the other side if you see, this is
maya, this is Mahamaya where Adi Shakti you

158
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:14,486
see does everything like human beings do,
everything.

159
00:16:14,486 --> 00:16:18,686
You won’t be able to find out that She is
Divine.

160
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:23,866
My family people could not find out till I
started this work, none of them, except for

161
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:28,126
my father and mother.

162
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:34,606
Nobody could find out that I had any powers.

163
00:16:34,606 --> 00:16:44,056
Such insensitivity to Divine can be created
by Mahamaya power of Adi Shakti, which is

164
00:16:44,056 --> 00:16:49,666
very important, otherwise you cannot judge,
you cannot understand.

165
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:57,476
Despite that, I’ve many times misjudged
people because they know how to camouflage

166
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,746
for a little while.

167
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:02,016
But then I discover.

168
00:17:02,016 --> 00:17:12,566
If the seeking is ardent and they are seeking
really the truth, they will find it, they

169
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:17,465
will find it, no doubt because the whole creation
is for them.

170
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:22,095
The whole universe is for them.

171
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:24,166
All Dieties are for them.

172
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,796
All angels are for them.

173
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:31,236
They are all looking out for them.

174
00:17:31,236 --> 00:17:37,276
This is important that we have so many sahaja
yogis.

175
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:43,676
Nobody had so many sahaja yogis in their lifetime.

176
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:47,476
Because we have to have channels.

177
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:54,406
I have to have channels and these channels
have to be very clean, have to be beautiful,

178
00:17:54,406 --> 00:18:00,386
innocent and benevolent.

179
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:12,736
If only they surrender to this fact that we
are here for as the instrument of God Almighty

180
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:27,726
and that we have to give benevolence to others,
I tell you at least 70% of work is done.

181
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:39,496
But even if they have got realisation, like
an egg comes out of the shell, some of the

182
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:50,666
birds still carry the part of the egg and
some of them are not even grown up to be birds.

183
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,706
Now we have to judge ourselves.

184
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:59,326
We have to understand ourselves.

185
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:06,136
Another thing you know that, I’m a very
mild person, very mild.

186
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:08,606
People think I’m very forgiving.

187
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,646
I know everyone, not that I don’t.

188
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:18,046
But I allow alright, go ahead, as far as you
can go.

189
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:22,896
Experience is the only way a human being can
understand, no doubt.

190
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:26,266
If you tell him something, he will never understand.

191
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:33,556
Experience of self-realisation has made you
understand but again, I would say, that we

192
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:40,146
cannot give realisation to the whole world,
we cannot.

193
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:44,676
They’re like stones, absolutely horrible
people.

194
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:51,996
Whatever is happening is that those who are
false are getting exposed.

195
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:56,726
And everybody is noticing that that they are
getting exposed.

196
00:19:56,726 --> 00:20:01,456
This exposure of course will save them from
these horrible people.

197
00:20:01,456 --> 00:20:09,066
But I don’t know if they will come to Sahaja
Yoga or if they would take their realisation.

198
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:17,006
This I’m telling you because now I to have
experience of human beings and all these years

199
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:25,626
I have been working, I have seen that there
are people and people and people.

200
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:35,176
Out of them the seekers are extremely proud
of their seeking.

201
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:40,076
So some of them don’t want to give up their
seeking, it's, it’s kind of a job.

202
00:20:40,076 --> 00:20:45,076
You can call it a hobby, they are seekers.

203
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:53,956
Now they have a certificate of being a seeker,
they wear funny dresses, have funny houses,

204
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:59,446
funny hair, everything, recluses they could
be, aggressive, anything, we are seekers.

205
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:04,086
They take a certificate upon themselves, we
are seekers.

206
00:21:04,086 --> 00:21:07,326
This is another quality of seekers also.

207
00:21:07,326 --> 00:21:14,946
They, for them it’s a kind of lifestyle,
they're seekers and wherever they have to

208
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:18,386
go, they will go for seeking, they’ll go
to 10 places, or 20 places.

209
00:21:18,386 --> 00:21:24,426
Every time they have argued with me, Mother
there must be some more ways of, yes maybe,

210
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:33,006
I don’t know of any, you can know.

211
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:38,996
Now the main job of Adi Shakti today is to
give realisation.

212
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:40,946
That’s My main job.

213
00:21:40,946 --> 00:21:48,566
All the rest is looked after, is already managed
I should say is like a computer.

214
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:53,026
I don’t have to work it, it’s a reflex
action.

215
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:55,496
Whatever is happening is in a reflex action.

216
00:21:55,496 --> 00:22:03,106
I don’t have to worry about these things,
whether ah like people might say that, “Mother

217
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:08,766
I prayed to you and how is it you helped me
so much?”

218
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:11,186
It’s all reflex action.

219
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:16,406
That time maybe that thought may come to me,
thought, but it’s reflex action.

220
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:18,886
I really don’t do anything.

221
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:20,876
Actually, I’m a [Shria??].

222
00:22:20,876 --> 00:22:22,246
Not doing anything whatsoever.

223
00:22:22,246 --> 00:22:28,716
The laziest person you could think of is Me.

224
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:40,116
Really because if there's a complete organisation
working for Me why should I, why [there is

225
00:22:40,116 --> 00:22:41,916
nothing necessary].

226
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:54,706
But one thing is there, I’m witnessing and
when I’m witnessing that acts on the reflex,

227
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,236
that works out, the Paramchaitanya.

228
00:22:58,236 --> 00:23:10,896
Because if that is the power of the Adi Shakti
then whatever I witness gets reported to that

229
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:11,906
power.

230
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:20,626
It’s the other way round, like see we have
electricity power somewhere so something goes

231
00:23:20,626 --> 00:23:24,716
wrong here, it is not reflected to that power.

232
00:23:24,716 --> 00:23:26,356
It is not.

233
00:23:26,356 --> 00:23:29,356
Something goes wrong, it finishes off here
and here.

234
00:23:29,356 --> 00:23:37,206
But the other way round that if I witness
something wrong, I don’t have to do anything,

235
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:45,506
I just witness, I’m just watching, the whole
thing acts through this tremendous power of

236
00:23:45,506 --> 00:23:47,366
Paramchaitanya.

237
00:23:47,366 --> 00:23:52,296
Now this power you do not know.

238
00:23:52,296 --> 00:24:00,236
You know Kundalini, you know all about charkas
there, this, that, but this power of Paramchaitanya

239
00:24:00,236 --> 00:24:13,026
is in every particle in you, every atom.

240
00:24:13,026 --> 00:24:31,116
And it acts in such a manner that it directs,
it pushes you, it takes you to the path of

241
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:32,116
benevolence.

242
00:24:32,116 --> 00:24:38,036
Sometimes people say, “Mother I wanted to
see to buy this shop, I couldn’t get it"

243
00:24:38,036 --> 00:24:39,036
and all that.

244
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:42,776
It is for your benevolence you didn’t get,
thank God.

245
00:24:42,776 --> 00:24:49,606
After 10 days they’ll come and say, thank
God I didn’t get it.

246
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:57,306
So gradually through experience, you start
understanding that you don’t have to worry.

247
00:24:57,306 --> 00:25:03,426
If you are lost on the way, normally people
get very upset but sahaja yogis don’t, oh

248
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:09,736
very nice, must be something here that God
has brought us.

249
00:25:09,736 --> 00:25:15,106
This action is like then changes.

250
00:25:15,106 --> 00:25:27,266
I would say the person who is overactive,
starts thinking now, surrender, Islam, surrender.

251
00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:38,626
Give this problem to this Paramchaitanya and
it works.

252
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:52,156
Such tremendous things have happened in this
world just by bandhans that it is unbelievable

253
00:25:52,156 --> 00:25:57,346
how these things are happening.

254
00:25:57,346 --> 00:26:05,216
Even supposing you find there are so many
murders, this thing has happened, that has

255
00:26:05,216 --> 00:26:06,216
happened.

256
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:14,676
This is also just to express presence of Paramchaitanya,
it’s prutha, it’s working out.

257
00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:18,396
The way it works.

258
00:26:18,396 --> 00:26:22,156
Prutha means the one which is done.

259
00:26:22,156 --> 00:26:32,676
Then you start realising that this power you
can achieve through your Kundalini.

260
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:40,806
So when your Kundalini rises, that is also
a reflection of Adi Shakti.

261
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:47,056
Like we can say, we see one part of moon,
the another part we don’t see.

262
00:26:47,056 --> 00:26:57,996
In the same way this power when rises within
you and touches this Paramchaitanya, then

263
00:26:57,996 --> 00:27:00,846
you become empowered by that.

264
00:27:00,846 --> 00:27:06,676
That’s how you are sahaja yogis.

265
00:27:06,676 --> 00:27:10,086
But you are not God.

266
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:17,636
The incarnations can say, “Í am God”.

267
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,836
You are not incarnations.

268
00:27:20,836 --> 00:27:33,446
But none of the incarnations have ever said
that they are Adi Shakti, cannot.

269
00:27:33,446 --> 00:27:41,536
This power of Adi Shakti which we call Paramchaitanya
is the power that loves you, has complete

270
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:43,766
control of the nature.

271
00:27:43,766 --> 00:27:57,936
It understands, it thinks, it knows everything,
everything about you, it knows.

272
00:27:57,936 --> 00:28:07,466
It works in every angle in every walk of your
life.

273
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:18,966
It is with you entirely as if supposing you
fall into a river which is flowing fast and

274
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:28,756
you cannot swim anymore, you cannot use your
hands anymore, you start flowing with it and

275
00:28:28,756 --> 00:28:35,596
then you realise that flowing with it is a
better thing than to try to get out of it.

276
00:28:35,596 --> 00:28:42,056
But just flowing with it, just enjoy all the
nature around you.

277
00:28:42,056 --> 00:28:43,056
You don’t get drowned.

278
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:47,326
On the contrary, you feel you are elevated.

279
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:54,176
And you’re flowing with it, then you understand,
what am I to do about something, whether it’s

280
00:28:54,176 --> 00:28:59,826
done by Paramchaitanya for me.

281
00:28:59,826 --> 00:29:07,216
But that it should be given to your Kundalini
which has worked it out, has put you onto

282
00:29:07,216 --> 00:29:16,326
that shore, has put you onto that beautiful
Heavenly Kingdom of God.

283
00:29:16,326 --> 00:29:22,116
Thus, you understand there are two things
that have happened: that first, your Mother,

284
00:29:22,116 --> 00:29:27,506
your Kundalini which is within you, which
is your own Mother, which has been with you

285
00:29:27,506 --> 00:29:30,966
throughout, has given you this birth.

286
00:29:30,966 --> 00:29:38,236
And then it has taken to that power, which
power you can use yourself.

287
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:41,696
You are empowered by that.

288
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,606
You’ll be amazed how this power helps.

289
00:29:44,606 --> 00:29:54,566
I mean, you see, I shouldn’t say that you
can have all the powers, I shouldn’t say

290
00:29:54,566 --> 00:29:55,566
that.

291
00:29:55,566 --> 00:29:59,166
But today you see they were complaining about
somebody, immediately I told the name of the

292
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,166
person.

293
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:03,156
Now you’ll say, how I knew.

294
00:30:03,156 --> 00:30:04,866
I just know.

295
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:06,009
That’s all I can say.

296
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:08,416
I just know.

297
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:13,116
Supposing you are dealing with carpets, alright,
so you know what pattern is this, what pattern

298
00:30:13,116 --> 00:30:20,646
is that, from where it has come, everything,
you know, isn’t it.

299
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:24,156
If you are there, you know everything.

300
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:32,016
If this power is everywhere, one has to know
everything, the connection is such.

301
00:30:32,016 --> 00:30:37,446
If you want to know, you can know anything.

302
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:49,256
So they have called also Buddha as Avalokiteshvara
that He sees all the lotus How does He see,

303
00:30:49,256 --> 00:31:06,126
Avalokiteshvara, because His ego what we call
is the paramaego, Mahatahamkara, knows everything,

304
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:13,256
while your ego doesn’t know anything.

305
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:22,816
Because it doesn’t know anything, you are
enveloped by it.

306
00:31:22,816 --> 00:31:30,506
If he had known, if the ego had known what
is the truth, you’ll be free person absolutely

307
00:31:30,506 --> 00:31:31,506
free.

308
00:31:31,506 --> 00:31:33,796
But you don’t want to surrender your ego.

309
00:31:33,796 --> 00:31:41,776
You don’t want to allow yourself to flow
into the river as Tao, [??] we say.

310
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:48,656
No you don’t want to enjoy, you want to
have your own speciality.

311
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:58,246
Individuality is very different from having
a kind of a ego within yourself that I am

312
00:31:58,246 --> 00:32:00,196
this, I am that.

313
00:32:00,196 --> 00:32:09,506
So this differentiation must start, after
realisation, in the light of realisation,

314
00:32:09,506 --> 00:32:12,106
you should start seeing.

315
00:32:12,106 --> 00:32:19,946
Now the first and foremost thing is to tell
your ego to sit down, keep quiet, you don’t

316
00:32:19,946 --> 00:32:22,126
want.

317
00:32:22,126 --> 00:32:27,456
And also in the modern times it’s a big
fashion you ask somebody, “I don’t know”.

318
00:32:27,456 --> 00:32:31,906
You ask somebody, what’s your name, “I
don’t know”.

319
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:36,396
He doesn’t even know his name.

320
00:32:36,396 --> 00:32:42,166
And to be stupid is a fashion.

321
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:46,756
To show that you are very stupid they think
they are showing they’re very innocent.

322
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,786
It’s not, it’s a stupidity.

323
00:32:48,786 --> 00:32:52,026
This stupidity, I don’t know which animal
has.

324
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:55,156
Still I don’t know what is the source of
it.

325
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:59,116
Still I’ll have to find out.

326
00:32:59,116 --> 00:33:02,096
Who is the animal that has generated this
stupidity in them.

327
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:08,276
But I know one thing, it is our ego.

328
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:12,886
Ego makes a person absolutely stupid.

329
00:33:12,886 --> 00:33:21,956
In Marathi, you see, thank God, language is
so rich, that anybody who starts showing off

330
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:29,716
his ego, they say his climbing on a bush,
there is a little bush and he is climbing

331
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,276
on that.

332
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:44,296
All this ego comes through your own so called
ideas, achievements.

333
00:33:44,296 --> 00:33:48,316
But what are these achievements.

334
00:33:48,316 --> 00:33:53,286
You don’t know anything.

335
00:33:53,286 --> 00:33:58,936
And this is what today I have to tell you
that if anything is working out today, is

336
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:03,186
your surrender of your ego.

337
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:08,036
If you know how to surrender your ego, you’ll
work it out.

338
00:34:08,036 --> 00:34:13,266
Another thing which surprises me sometimes,
in the West specially, that I think that the

339
00:34:13,266 --> 00:34:16,736
women are the power are the Shakti.

340
00:34:16,736 --> 00:34:27,685
But in the West I find women are not using
Adi Shakti, no.

341
00:34:27,685 --> 00:34:43,025
Firstly, they are still very much possessed
by their emotions and by their ideas and things

342
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:44,276
like that.

343
00:34:44,276 --> 00:34:47,185
One side is man, who is doing everything.

344
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,966
But even women are very egoistical, very much.

345
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,855
It’s very difficult.

346
00:34:52,855 --> 00:35:02,466
For example, you marry some girl, Western
girl, to somebody, she’ll be very happy,

347
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:10,266
jumping, taking all the presents, congratulations,
wearing all dress, everything.

348
00:35:10,266 --> 00:35:14,875
After 10 days, she’ll come and say, “Mother
I’m confused”.

349
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:16,586
Confused, how?

350
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:19,136
“I’m now confused”.

351
00:35:19,136 --> 00:35:21,926
You’re confused now or before.

352
00:35:21,926 --> 00:35:23,275
“I’m now confused”.

353
00:35:23,275 --> 00:35:24,275
Alright.

354
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:25,275
You return all your ornaments and everything.

355
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:29,365
“No, no then let me think”.

356
00:35:29,365 --> 00:35:35,706
This is not the level of a sahaja yogini.

357
00:35:35,706 --> 00:35:44,166
Sahaja yogini is the Shakti and she has to
take up challenges, I’ll show you, I’ll

358
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:45,796
do it better.

359
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:53,966
On the contrary I find them extremely dominating,
I’m amazed, why should Shakti dominate.

360
00:35:53,966 --> 00:35:57,416
If she’s Shakti, she’ll not dominate.

361
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,816
Those who are not will dominate.

362
00:35:59,816 --> 00:36:07,986
Like you see you go in India to any collector’s
house, the collector will be humble but the

363
00:36:07,986 --> 00:36:11,526
constable would be dominating.

364
00:36:11,526 --> 00:36:19,176
In the same way, I find, this domination business
is very common.

365
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:26,825
And also a kind of a temperament of like a
nun.

366
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:30,865
They’ll dress up like a nun, behave like
a nun.

367
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:33,216
They won’t smile.

368
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:34,216
What is?

369
00:36:34,216 --> 00:36:35,246
Are you sahaja yoginis?

370
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:38,015
Or what are you, are you nuns?

371
00:36:38,015 --> 00:36:39,426
Then better join nunnery.

372
00:36:39,426 --> 00:36:45,585
Why I’m telling you while talking about
Adi Shakti so I’m talking about Shakti,

373
00:36:45,585 --> 00:36:48,436
how the Shakti has to come up.

374
00:36:48,436 --> 00:36:53,515
I was surprised that women were not spreading
Sahaja Yoga.

375
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:56,926
Somebody told me that the leaders do not want
women to spread Sahaja Yoga.

376
00:36:56,926 --> 00:36:57,926
This is wrong.

377
00:36:57,926 --> 00:37:01,125
If the leaders say that, it’s not proper.

378
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:12,095
But first of all the sahaja yoginis have to
be real sahaja yoginis because so far I’ve

379
00:37:12,095 --> 00:37:18,865
seen anybody is, you try to give any lady,
try to give her the position of a leader,

380
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:22,656
she just finishes off the thing.

381
00:37:22,656 --> 00:37:27,605
Not all, but some.

382
00:37:27,605 --> 00:37:43,146
Now the duty of a sahaja yogini is to develop
herself through meditation, through understanding

383
00:37:43,146 --> 00:37:52,476
oneself and through self-esteem that I’m
a sahaja yogini, I’m the one who is Shakti,

384
00:37:52,476 --> 00:37:55,085
I’m the potential of that.

385
00:37:55,085 --> 00:37:57,035
I’m the potential myself.

386
00:37:57,035 --> 00:37:58,396
What do I do, nothing?

387
00:37:58,396 --> 00:38:03,085
I didn’t do like this, I didn’t put this
on, nothing of the kind.

388
00:38:03,085 --> 00:38:06,886
I’m nice visiting and talking.

389
00:38:06,886 --> 00:38:12,196
But potential, am I the potential?

390
00:38:12,196 --> 00:38:17,055
This is what the sahaja yoginis have to decide.

391
00:38:17,055 --> 00:38:25,345
Otherwise, they’re possessed, they're day
dreaming, thinking no end of themselves.

392
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:27,656
It’s very difficult.

393
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:34,206
I want some nice sahaja yoginis to be the
leaders, I really want.

394
00:38:34,206 --> 00:38:41,636
But as soon as they become leader, they are
on a horse, running so fast.

395
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:46,226
So humble downwards.

396
00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:54,535
Unless and until there’s a big space in
the pitcher what water can flow into it.

397
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:57,236
Have a very large heart.

398
00:38:57,236 --> 00:39:04,046
Anybody comes to your house, you don’t like
it, don’t want to do anything for other

399
00:39:04,046 --> 00:39:08,426
sahaja yogis, looking after them.

400
00:39:08,426 --> 00:39:14,855
It is really again and again I say in the
West, that women have to take up Shakti unto

401
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:15,855
themselves.

402
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:19,276
And Shakti doesn’t mean dominate your husband
and make a fool out of him.

403
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:23,886
No, it means give him powers.

404
00:39:23,886 --> 00:39:28,396
You are the supply of power of the whole family.

405
00:39:28,396 --> 00:39:30,176
And this is our family.

406
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:31,636
All this is my family.

407
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,466
I’m so concerned about everyone.

408
00:39:33,466 --> 00:39:37,176
Even the little thing I’m bothered about.

409
00:39:37,176 --> 00:39:43,725
I’m never satisfied that I’ve done my
job now and I can now tonight I’ll go off

410
00:39:43,725 --> 00:39:45,966
to sleep and not think of anyone.

411
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,236
Never.

412
00:39:47,236 --> 00:39:50,746
I’m concerned about this, I’m concerned
about that.

413
00:39:50,746 --> 00:40:00,576
All the time it’s flowing, this power, and
My concern this power that works because My

414
00:40:00,576 --> 00:40:02,636
concern is genuine.

415
00:40:02,636 --> 00:40:06,085
I’m not concerned about Myself, never.

416
00:40:06,085 --> 00:40:14,406
You’ll be amazed when I see all these women
doing all kinds of things to themselves, I’m

417
00:40:14,406 --> 00:40:15,406
surprised.

418
00:40:15,406 --> 00:40:18,666
What is needed is the concern.

419
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:27,456
And once you develop that concern, a genuine,
loving, compassionate concern about others.

420
00:40:27,456 --> 00:40:32,186
Even about children, I’ve seen that, they
never look after each other’s children.

421
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:34,656
They never help others.

422
00:40:34,656 --> 00:40:40,025
Somebody had to go for taking out the tooth,
she had to carry the child with her.

423
00:40:40,025 --> 00:40:42,265
This is true.

424
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:48,365
If you do not have concern, then you’ll
not have collective mind, you’ll not have

425
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:50,976
the collective power.

426
00:40:50,976 --> 00:40:56,746
And it’s important that you all should try
to be very collective, look after each other’s.

427
00:40:56,746 --> 00:41:02,005
Now I shouldn’t say this, I was going to
tell it to Cabella ladies, that this house

428
00:41:02,005 --> 00:41:08,216
in Cabella is an ashram and those people who
come from other ashrams, even from Australia,

429
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:11,996
are surprised, that they are all living here
just like a hotel.

430
00:41:11,996 --> 00:41:17,976
They’re paying for it, we all pay but we
have gardens, we look after the gardens, we

431
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,716
look after the outside.

432
00:41:19,716 --> 00:41:21,936
Here nobody’s bothered.

433
00:41:21,936 --> 00:41:26,676
They’re using everything, not bothered.

434
00:41:26,676 --> 00:41:31,375
Surprisingly why when I’m living here, they
are like this.

435
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:36,555
You go to any place in Australia, you go to
America, anywhere, wherever there’s an ashram,

436
00:41:36,555 --> 00:41:40,186
they all work on Sundays.

437
00:41:40,186 --> 00:41:41,186
Here I’ve not seen.

438
00:41:41,186 --> 00:41:42,186
They all disappear.

439
00:41:42,186 --> 00:41:44,646
This is your ashram.

440
00:41:44,646 --> 00:41:46,956
You are staying here.

441
00:41:46,956 --> 00:41:53,765
And is now today I have to tell this because
I feel that Sahaja Yoga is missing out itself

442
00:41:53,765 --> 00:41:57,176
on their Shaktis.

443
00:41:57,176 --> 00:42:03,365
Some of them do not know how to smiling, And
some of them are extremely dominating.

444
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:07,115
I have to tell you this because you are so
important.

445
00:42:07,115 --> 00:42:10,156
But for Me, no man would have done this job.

446
00:42:10,156 --> 00:42:12,986
No man incarnation would have done this job.

447
00:42:12,986 --> 00:42:16,946
Christ, he get crucified at a young age, very
nice.

448
00:42:16,946 --> 00:42:25,156
Get crucified at such a young age, then another
one takes to poison, another one is killed

449
00:42:25,156 --> 00:42:26,156
by somebody.

450
00:42:26,156 --> 00:42:29,535
It’s like that, they all died very young.

451
00:42:29,535 --> 00:42:35,555
Nobody wanted to do this work, nobody was,
I mean, they got fed up.

452
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:36,926
Got fed up.

453
00:42:36,926 --> 00:42:42,437
We had Ganeshwara who went into Samadhi at
the age of 23 years, can you imagine.

454
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:46,026
He must have been fed up with the people.

455
00:42:46,026 --> 00:42:53,676
Now it is for you people, the ladies, have
to develop that patience of your Mother, that

456
00:42:53,676 --> 00:43:00,036
affection, that love and then you will see
how your Shakti will work out.

457
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:04,186
I again and again always have talked about
this.

458
00:43:04,186 --> 00:43:12,216
And at Adi Shakti point, I have to say you
are in your family like a Shakti.

459
00:43:12,216 --> 00:43:15,446
And you have to be wise, you have to be sensible.

460
00:43:15,446 --> 00:43:17,315
You have to understand your husband.

461
00:43:17,315 --> 00:43:19,006
You have to understand your children.

462
00:43:19,006 --> 00:43:20,625
You have to have patience.

463
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:24,766
On the contrary, they spoil their children.

464
00:43:24,766 --> 00:43:31,526
That is to be understood, that you must know
first what is good for their benevolence.

465
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:38,986
Today for example, if I say the children if
they go to a school, they should not be removed.

466
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:40,236
It is for their benevolence.

467
00:43:40,236 --> 00:43:44,095
What are the people going to gain out of it.

468
00:43:44,095 --> 00:43:45,926
So somebody says no.

469
00:43:45,926 --> 00:43:48,946
Alright, get out.

470
00:43:48,946 --> 00:43:53,146
What can you do?

471
00:43:53,146 --> 00:43:58,706
Such attachment to your own children shows
you are a powerless person.

472
00:43:58,706 --> 00:44:05,696
You must love all the children, you must look
after all the children, you must enjoy all

473
00:44:05,696 --> 00:44:09,476
the children, take interest.

474
00:44:09,476 --> 00:44:16,005
But what I find that they are only interested
in their own children.

475
00:44:16,005 --> 00:44:17,845
We are a joint family.

476
00:44:17,845 --> 00:44:20,276
We live together.

477
00:44:20,276 --> 00:44:24,996
We have to share everything.

478
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:28,926
It is something I can’t understand.

479
00:44:28,926 --> 00:44:38,196
Say, our, in India, say, if you see 5, 6 children,
all the girls will run after them.

480
00:44:38,196 --> 00:44:39,686
All the women will look after them.

481
00:44:39,686 --> 00:44:46,035
I mean, it’s such a pleasure to them, to
any children, just to look after them.

482
00:44:46,035 --> 00:44:56,526
But this kind of insensitivity to your collective
behaviour is going to also spoil your children.

483
00:44:56,526 --> 00:45:08,136
So what you are going to transmit to the whole
world is this Sahaja living and the women

484
00:45:08,136 --> 00:45:09,566
make the society.

485
00:45:09,566 --> 00:45:15,375
If Indian society is good, the credit goes
to the Indian women and their wisdom.

486
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:16,805
Men are stupid in India.

487
00:45:16,805 --> 00:45:20,446
They spoil politics, economics, everything.

488
00:45:20,446 --> 00:45:30,325
But society is still maintained and they are
very very still say on the right path.

489
00:45:30,325 --> 00:45:34,375
This only comes because of the wisdom of the
women.

490
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:39,976
If the women are busy dressing up for hours
together, thinking about their clothes, what

491
00:45:39,976 --> 00:45:46,575
they’re going to wear, finished.

492
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:57,486
This is a day of worshipping the Kundalini
who is the Mother.

493
00:45:57,486 --> 00:45:59,736
She is the Mother.

494
00:45:59,736 --> 00:46:01,386
And you are the mother.

495
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:04,946
You must know each and everything about your
child.

496
00:46:04,946 --> 00:46:08,355
Somebody comes and tells me, “My child is
now a drug addict”.

497
00:46:08,355 --> 00:46:10,406
How can that be possible?

498
00:46:10,406 --> 00:46:15,865
In India children, don’t get drug addicts
because all the time the mother is on their

499
00:46:15,865 --> 00:46:18,986
head like a hawk.

500
00:46:18,986 --> 00:46:22,595
She knows where he goes, what he does, she
loves.

501
00:46:22,595 --> 00:46:25,355
But she knows, very well.

502
00:46:25,355 --> 00:46:32,456
Even when we are in college, even when I'm
married, we went home, my mother would ask,

503
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,545
“Where did you go?

504
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:38,105
Did I not say, come back by 6”.

505
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:39,436
Even when we are married.

506
00:46:39,436 --> 00:46:45,375
And we are suppose to tell her.

507
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:47,416
That was the mother’s work.

508
00:46:47,416 --> 00:46:52,966
The child where he goes, what does he do,
and then to say children don’t listen to

509
00:46:52,966 --> 00:46:53,966
me.

510
00:46:53,966 --> 00:47:00,085
Because why the children do not listen, because
you do not discipline them.

511
00:47:00,085 --> 00:47:06,325
Here the atmosphere is very bad agreed, and
the children are very bad, agreed.

512
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:08,756
Everything is there, agreed.

513
00:47:08,756 --> 00:47:16,075
But if you are a strong mother in your love,
your children will not wander.

514
00:47:16,075 --> 00:47:22,025
See, even now as you know that, all the time
there are all these leaders are hovering around

515
00:47:22,025 --> 00:47:23,575
Me, what is there.

516
00:47:23,575 --> 00:47:27,406
I have no honey with me or anything but they
are just sitting there, just sitting next

517
00:47:27,406 --> 00:47:30,556
to Me, all the leaders.

518
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:39,436
But this is after realisation but My even
all My nephews you see, they would all come

519
00:47:39,436 --> 00:47:47,305
and sit next to Me, all My in, daughter-in-laws
they would sit next to Me, they would not

520
00:47:47,305 --> 00:47:48,305
leave Me.

521
00:47:48,305 --> 00:47:51,265
And people will start saying, what’s wrong
with you, you're all the time sticking on

522
00:47:51,265 --> 00:47:54,805
to your aunt, what is it?

523
00:47:54,805 --> 00:48:06,125
The concern and they understand that it is
for their benevolence you are telling them.

524
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:09,105
But yourself should be alright.

525
00:48:09,105 --> 00:48:14,926
As a mother one has to be tolerant, one has
to understand but when you have to tell them

526
00:48:14,926 --> 00:48:17,736
you have to tell them.

527
00:48:17,736 --> 00:48:24,696
If you think you can tell them sharply or
maybe in a proper way but the child should

528
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:31,396
know that you love the child and that you
love all the children.

529
00:48:31,396 --> 00:48:32,996
It is very subtle.

530
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:41,585
Like I've seen, once I took a child of one
sahaja yogi with Me to the market, he was

531
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:46,845
asking "I'll buy this, I'll buy that,[I]’ll
buy that", everything he wanted to buy.

532
00:48:46,845 --> 00:48:49,966
I was wondering What's wrong with this boy.

533
00:48:49,966 --> 00:48:55,045
But say if I take my own grandchildren, they
won't buy, nothing.

534
00:48:55,045 --> 00:48:58,406
Even if you want to buy two pairs of shoes,
"No, no, no, one is sufficient".

535
00:48:58,406 --> 00:48:59,646
If this will be then only.

536
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:01,255
They'll never ask for anything.

537
00:49:01,255 --> 00:49:07,585
It's a kind of a self-esteem.

538
00:49:07,585 --> 00:49:08,825
They don't want anything.

539
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:10,966
Same with the wives.

540
00:49:10,966 --> 00:49:16,585
Wives never ask for anything from their husband,
nothing.

541
00:49:16,585 --> 00:49:17,686
Nothing.

542
00:49:17,686 --> 00:49:22,115
The husband will go on asking, please ask
for something, ask for something.

543
00:49:22,115 --> 00:49:25,875
No, they don't want anything.

544
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:32,085
That is going to be a sahaja yogini mother
and a wife and a shakti.

545
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:36,115
She has no demands.

546
00:49:36,115 --> 00:49:39,736
Nothing she's asking for.

547
00:49:39,736 --> 00:49:44,615
The one who's a giver, what is she going to
ask.

548
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:50,785
The one who is a supplier, what is she going
to ask.

549
00:49:50,785 --> 00:49:58,516
So I feel sometimes that the left side, the
women side in Sahaja Yoga is a little bit

550
00:49:58,516 --> 00:50:01,125
going down.

551
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,206
And they have to come up.

552
00:50:02,206 --> 00:50:08,916
First, meditation, the respect of Mother,
teaching the children how to work out Sahaja

553
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:20,446
Yoga, talking to them about Sahaja Yoga and
not only about food, of cleanliness, of being

554
00:50:20,446 --> 00:50:27,036
nice to others, how to share things.

555
00:50:27,036 --> 00:50:33,535
And telling children about good stories that
you have heard about.

556
00:50:33,535 --> 00:50:38,045
Telling them what is dharma is, talking to
them.

557
00:50:38,045 --> 00:50:40,136
Having a rapport.

558
00:50:40,136 --> 00:50:46,666
This is what you have to understand to make
Sahaja Yoga very strong.

559
00:50:46,666 --> 00:50:51,065
You are the Shakti of Sahaja Yoga take it
from Me.

560
00:50:51,065 --> 00:50:54,325
And you have to work it out that way.

561
00:50:54,325 --> 00:50:57,646
Instead of worrying about small, small things.

562
00:50:57,646 --> 00:51:05,656
Some times I receive letters from the ladies,
sometimes, it really pains me.

563
00:51:05,656 --> 00:51:12,916
I can't understand how they are sahaja yogis.

564
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:23,686
Our whole system of Sahaja has to be a moral
system that others should see and understand

565
00:51:23,686 --> 00:51:30,285
that what we have achieved in our day to day
life.

566
00:51:30,285 --> 00:51:37,745
Adi Shakti works in day to day life, the smallest
things to the highest.

567
00:51:37,745 --> 00:51:41,546
And all the time you have to learn, all the
time you have to learn.

568
00:51:41,546 --> 00:51:45,855
Whether you are a leader or not a leader,
all the time you must know what it is you

569
00:51:45,855 --> 00:51:47,426
have to know.

570
00:51:47,426 --> 00:51:51,575
I have not known this, I have not known that.

571
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:57,575
Unless and until you develop that kind of
an attitude that I have to learn that you

572
00:51:57,575 --> 00:52:04,536
humble attitude, that humility, I have to
learn, I have to learn, still I have to learn,

573
00:52:04,536 --> 00:52:07,446
this ego will never come.

574
00:52:07,446 --> 00:52:11,585
Because of this ego you are satisfied with
yourself, that's the sign of an ego.

575
00:52:11,585 --> 00:52:17,335
You don't know how much you are torturing
others, what you are destroying, nothing.

576
00:52:17,335 --> 00:52:22,265
But you feel extremely happy with yourself.

577
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:35,286
Such a happy go lucky personality sometimes
is living on air.

578
00:52:35,286 --> 00:52:42,535
What I have done today for somebody else,
how have I talked to somebody else, what have

579
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:44,555
I given to somebody else.

580
00:52:44,555 --> 00:52:50,505
I need not give you presents, there's nothing,
why should I give you presents.

581
00:52:50,505 --> 00:52:54,115
But I give you presents because of My own
satisfaction.

582
00:52:54,115 --> 00:53:02,006
And if I take presents from you, it is for
your own satisfaction.

583
00:53:02,006 --> 00:53:11,575
So what we have to do, in what we find satisfaction,
what do we find satisfaction, just think about

584
00:53:11,575 --> 00:53:15,166
it, what do we find satisfaction in.

585
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:22,815
My house should be alright, my husband should
be alright, my children should be alright,

586
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:26,545
my, my, my.

587
00:53:26,545 --> 00:53:41,396
Unless and until this my shifts to another
person, you are still in the realm of maya.

588
00:53:41,396 --> 00:53:51,085
You have to learn this is to think everyday
or write, all of you should write diaries,

589
00:53:51,085 --> 00:54:03,696
what have I done for others, what have I said
to others, what will make or please another

590
00:54:03,696 --> 00:54:04,706
person.

591
00:54:04,706 --> 00:54:13,886
Small, small things can make the life so beautiful.

592
00:54:13,886 --> 00:54:18,615
And also very big things there are for you.

593
00:54:18,615 --> 00:54:25,345
If you do not think, if you do not think you
are very big, all these big things are also

594
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,285
for you.

595
00:54:27,285 --> 00:54:43,345
It's like this, this whole sky can be covered
by one leaf if you see the leaf against the

596
00:54:43,345 --> 00:54:45,986
sky, the leaf shows it’s existence.

597
00:54:45,986 --> 00:55:00,995
In the same way, this whole vision of Sahaja
Yoga can be completely covered by one person

598
00:55:00,995 --> 00:55:13,636
who stands with this great expanse, one person
here and one person there.

599
00:55:13,636 --> 00:55:16,386
It's so remarkable.

600
00:55:16,386 --> 00:55:17,865
It's such a lot of Sahaja Yoga.

601
00:55:17,865 --> 00:55:25,706
There are people who are here and there and
there, so remarkable that if you take their

602
00:55:25,706 --> 00:55:36,105
names also, I just feel I'm drenched into
the ocean of joy.

603
00:55:36,105 --> 00:55:41,926
Only one person, then what about you?

604
00:55:41,926 --> 00:55:45,845
Why can't we do that.

605
00:55:45,845 --> 00:55:55,065
When Adi Shakti is with you reflected when
all Her powers are with you, how much we can

606
00:55:55,065 --> 00:56:02,785
do in this expanse of My vision.

607
00:56:02,785 --> 00:56:16,816
I want to have more and more people who will
be of some visions themselves.

608
00:56:16,816 --> 00:56:21,355
But not small people who just think of their
children, think of food.

609
00:56:21,355 --> 00:56:23,055
No, no, they are not wanted, useless.

610
00:56:23,055 --> 00:56:24,265
They will all drop out.

611
00:56:24,265 --> 00:56:41,555
I hope you have understood where you are,
what do you have, what is created within you

612
00:56:41,555 --> 00:56:45,926
is this Kundalini which has given you all
the knowledge and everything.

613
00:56:45,926 --> 00:56:50,706
But there are so many I know who don't even
know what is this chakra, they don't know,

614
00:56:50,706 --> 00:56:54,095
I mean going to that limit of ignorance.

615
00:56:54,095 --> 00:56:57,555
You have to know all these things.

616
00:56:57,555 --> 00:57:11,396
You have to understand what it is because
this is for you, all for you, all this knowledge.

617
00:57:11,396 --> 00:57:16,646
And the greatest of all is the faith.

618
00:57:16,646 --> 00:57:22,966
Not a faith which is blind but enlightened
faith that you are now one with that Divine

619
00:57:22,966 --> 00:57:26,246
power.

620
00:57:26,246 --> 00:57:28,505
This should really settle you completely.

621
00:57:28,505 --> 00:57:40,006
This is I think that this is one of the most
important pujas because so far guru pujas

622
00:57:40,006 --> 00:57:43,936
have been there, so many people have worshipped
those gurus.

623
00:57:43,936 --> 00:57:48,555
Or maybe My birthday as you think it be, it's
alright.

624
00:57:48,555 --> 00:57:58,345
But I think to understand your own powers
of Kundalini and your powers that are available

625
00:57:58,345 --> 00:58:05,545
to you to the working of Paramchaitanya is
very important.

626
00:58:05,545 --> 00:58:10,575
That will give you confidence, that'll give
you compassion, that'll give you a vision

627
00:58:10,575 --> 00:58:16,305
and that will make you a very great personality,
a very great personality.

628
00:58:16,305 --> 00:58:18,555
What was George Washington?

629
00:58:18,555 --> 00:58:21,375
They said he was great.

630
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:22,686
What was Abraham Lincoln.

631
00:58:22,686 --> 00:58:24,496
He was great.

632
00:58:24,496 --> 00:58:30,196
But you are all having your self-realisation.

633
00:58:30,196 --> 00:58:36,296
You have to think of the whole universe, the
whole expanse unless and until that brain

634
00:58:36,296 --> 00:58:45,775
develops in you, I'm sure very sure that the
progress of Sahaja Yoga within and without

635
00:58:45,775 --> 00:58:47,436
will be less.

636
00:58:47,436 --> 00:58:50,350
So understand these powers are with you.

637
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:53,240
You have to utilise them, with humility.

638
00:58:53,939 --> 00:58:59,113
May God bless you.
