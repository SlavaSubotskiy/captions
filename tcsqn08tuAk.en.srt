1
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:41,952
Shri Mataji (in Hindi: Sorry I am late, my granddaughter is a little sick

2
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:50,982
and I stayed back to make her better.

3
00:00:52,956 --> 00:00:56,562
First I will speak in English and then in Hindi.

4
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:10,460
Today we are going to worship Rajalakshmi,

5
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:21,111
means the Goddess which rules the kings.

6
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:32,541
It’s a very important thing today to understand

7
00:01:33,764 --> 00:01:38,267
that something has basically gone wrong

8
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:46,856
in the working of our political systems

9
00:01:49,298 --> 00:02:01,063
and why the people have lost their sense of

10
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:11,821
justice, fair play and the benevolence of the people.

11
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:19,696
Where have we gone wrong that this is being lost?

12
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:32,859
It’s not only in India, it’s not only in Japan or in England

13
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:41,923
or any other place where we think there is democracy.

14
00:02:51,383 --> 00:02:59,353
First and foremost thing is that all these countries,

15
00:02:59,553 --> 00:03:04,453
even those who have got their freedom,

16
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:07,802
started following those countries

17
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:12,822
which were supposed to be highty and mighty and very powerful

18
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:20,259
– like America, like Russia, like China, England –

19
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:29,997
without understanding how far they have reached

20
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:36,516
in delivering the goods that they are supposed to do.

21
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:43,859
In any case, in a country like England,

22
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:49,125
you see the monarchy, the way it has been working,

23
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:54,703
is shocking, absolutely shocking.

24
00:03:56,445 --> 00:04:04,992
The way they have acted towards their ministers, like Cromwell,

25
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:14,622
you feel as if some primitive people are trying to manage something.

26
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,083
And the kings so cruel, queens so cruel,

27
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:24,492
so character-less, so irresponsible.

28
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:33,031
They had no character to be kings and queens.

29
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:45,417
There was no surrendering to the Rajalakshmi principle of one’s being.

30
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:51,101
Then of course, it became independent,

31
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:57,250
and even now I find such stupid things they’re doing.

32
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:05,490
Even in France the president has a keep,

33
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:11,078
they run after money, little money here and there.

34
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:18,920
There are people in every country who are really of very, very low level

35
00:05:18,922 --> 00:05:27,770
and who are trying to look after the welfare of the people.

36
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,922
Also if you read the history of Samurai

37
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:37,968
and all those people in Japan you are shocked.

38
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,512
They thought no end of themselves,

39
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:44,913
they had no connection with the public and the way they behaved.

40
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,990
Then you go to the communist countries also the same sort of thing.

41
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:56,513
There also those who came in power

42
00:05:56,515 --> 00:06:03,430
became really like despotic rulers.

43
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,499
Then we have on the other side Mr. Hitler

44
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:11,427
who came, thinking no end of himself.

45
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:17,828
Spain, as you know was ruined by Franco.

46
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,640
One cannot understand how these people without any character,

47
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:30,740
without any higher qualities than the rest of the people

48
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:34,249
can look after their well-being.

49
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,883
It’s impossible!

50
00:06:43,031 --> 00:06:49,989
I should say in our own country we had great kings, very great,

51
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:54,734
because our heritage is great

52
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,429
and we had saints who really ruled the kings.

53
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:08,930
Like Shivaji had a guru who was a great saint, everybody.

54
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,790
Janaka had a guru.

55
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,340
Everybody had a guru.

56
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,920
Even Shri Rama had a guru.

57
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,430
But they were real gurus!

58
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,519
They were the people who really lived the life of saints,

59
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:33,060
they were real saints, inside, outside.

60
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:47,489
And the people also accepted the kings who had spiritual background.

61
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:49,910
Those who respected spiritual people.

62
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:58,970
So, the whole trend in this country was very, very different

63
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,900
till sometime.

64
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:10,260
I don’t know when the English came what happened to them.

65
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,720
The majority of the people didn’t like

66
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,780
the way the English were living, their style, their methods,

67
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,389
they didn’t appreciate.

68
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,910
But these king and queens of different states

69
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,320
they started feeling that they are very sophisticated people

70
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,160
and we should have their culture.

71
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,170
And so many of these queens, modern ones,

72
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:47,060
who smoke, who drink, tell Me that it was taught by their governess

73
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:57,440
who came either from Sweden or from England or from Australia.

74
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,420
And they picked up these things.

75
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,170
Of course the men also thought that we are very backward, you see,

76
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,150
that’s the idea they gave them, “You are very backward people,

77
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:12,020
you don’t know how to smoke, you don’t know how to drink,

78
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,930
you have no ballroom dancing,” this that.

79
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,360
Even our military got corrupted with it.

80
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,990
In the military

81
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,990
is all English style things still going on.

82
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,630
I don’t know when will they stop.

83
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,490
They don’t know anything about our own country.

84
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,460
They’ll know about England,

85
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,120
and you ask them anything about England they’ll know.

86
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,160
The whole education system came through English,

87
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,190
but all about England and western life than about Indian life.

88
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:55,080
Nobody ever cared for Indian things, you see.

89
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,300
Even in medicine same thing happened.

90
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,790
Nobody wanted to listen to any vaidya (ayurveda) or anyone.

91
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:12,610
They thought “Oh, these are useless primitive people, backward!”

92
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,750
So even one country, which was really, I should say,

93
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:29,630
had spirituality ruling in the politics also went down like this.

94
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:35,150
Before independence in this country, I remember,

95
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,770
we had to fight the British,

96
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:45,830
and what patriotism people had at that time.

97
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:51,420
I remember once we had gone to see a hockey match,

98
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,900
and My father always had a national flag on it,

99
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,260
that time it was not national it was congress flag, in the car.

100
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,820
So the soldiers came, they said, “Take down this flag!”

101
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,970
So My driver got down he said,

102
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,290
“You cut my throat first and then you take down the flag!”.

103
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:21,680
We all children joined him and they were shocked, went back.

104
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,120
Such enthusiasm, such patriotism came at that time

105
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:36,800
when we were fighting these people.

106
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,320
But they divided us and created a problem for us.

107
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,480
And you know before we could enjoy any fruits of our freedom,

108
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:54,050
we were fighting, we were divided.

109
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,590
I don’t know whom to blame for that.

110
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,940
If we had not accepted this division,

111
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,800
there would have been no problem.

112
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,010
But they accepted it.

113
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,570
Now, poor Bangladeshi’s are so, so, so poor.

114
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:19,200
If they were one with India, they would have been much better.

115
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,280
And what is Pakistan?

116
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,050
It’s just an empty place, you know,

117
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,900
no industries, nothing.

118
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,390
That’s why they are all the time talking about Kashmir, Kashmir.

119
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,820
They have nothing else!

120
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:37,690
[In] their own country people are having fights, this that, but there’s no growth.

121
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,390
Now they cut out only this India.

122
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:52,640
Now here, after all this happening, you know, any war,

123
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:59,910
any kind of crisis like that, immediately changes the value system.

124
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,700
Not that in the West there were no value systems, there were,

125
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:11,730
but the war completely changed them in the same way in India also.

126
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:17,310
Politicians, those who lost their lives in the fights,

127
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:25,920
or those who stood for something good were regarded as no ideal.

128
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,790
And people took a U-turn, absolutely a U-turn

129
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,590
and they became very self-centred,

130
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,830
only worried about their own personal things, their families,

131
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:45,620
or maybe accumulation of money and

132
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,240
transferring of money from here to Switzerland.

133
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,280
I mean something, I mean I tell you I’ve gone through My life

134
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,310
with the people who were fighting, fighting for freedom.

135
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:04,770
I mean they could not even think of these things.

136
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,410
I know My father, I know My mother, I know their friends,

137
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:13,610
I know so many people who were in our family used to come,

138
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:19,880
so many Sikhs and so many other people, Muslims even.

139
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:25,980
They could not think of taking any money,

140
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:32,310
I mean it was really regarded as very low-level.

141
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:41,700
For what to take?

142
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,020
What is the need?

143
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:51,730
If you are satisfied in your heart of what you wanted, you got,

144
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,820
you’ve got your freedom, now finished.

145
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:00,480
But how these people who were absolutely at the bottom,

146
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,140
who did nothing for the country,

147
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,180
sacrificed nothing for the country,

148
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:16,190
just came up on top and all the good people went down.

149
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:23,760
If you read the history of Shivaji,

150
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,890
or Rana Pratap, or any of them, Shalivahana, anyone,

151
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:35,820
you’ll be surprised how they used to worship Shakti.

152
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,740
All the Kshatriyas used to worship Shakti,

153
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,630
and they would go up to a point and not beyond.

154
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,770
Up to the point till the dharma was there.

155
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,280
That history I cannot repeat it to you.

156
00:15:53,280 --> 00:16:00,390
But in the subtle way, one feels that

157
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:07,800
this partition suddenly changed the attitude of people,

158
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:15,400
or I should say those who were very low-level they came up.

159
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:22,100
I remember I was here at that time, partition time,

160
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:31,910
and I was married and three people came to Me.

161
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,050
I was sitting outside in the garden,

162
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,830
knitting something for My child because I was pregnant.

163
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:43,660
So they came, and they looked at Me and they said,

164
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:49,660
“Can we have one room in your house?”

165
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,960
I said, “Why not, I’ve got it.

166
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,560
It’s a very big house of My father.

167
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,070
I’ll give it to you.”

168
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:03,380
They said, “We need for one or two months.

169
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,380
We are refugees.”

170
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,380
I said “Alright, and it has an outside door,

171
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,460
you need not bother us and there’s also kitchen attached

172
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,760
and a bathroom attached.

173
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,549
You can do whatever you like.”

174
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:15,430
Just I offered.

175
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:20,640
In the evening My brother came, elder brother, and My husband

176
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,490
and both of them were friends and he just started shouting at Me.

177
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,930
These people were in the other room.

178
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,590
“What do you mean by keeping such people?

179
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,590
Who are they?

180
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,130
What will they do?” and this and that.

181
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,910
I said, “What will they do?”

182
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,170
“They may steal something from me!”

183
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:44,480
“So what is there in this house to steal?

184
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,540
They are refugees, look nice people to Me.

185
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,490
I have approved them because of vibrations they’re alright.”

186
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,080
“No, no, no, no, no better throw them away!”

187
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,300
I said, Look at these people [my husband and brother],

188
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:06,530
“Without even talking to them, knowing them, suddenly

189
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:14,610
you are asking them to get out only because they are refugees.”

190
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:19,980
Then I did feel that in this country a new wave had started,

191
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:26,070
that a person is not respected if he has no money,

192
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,400
he’s not trusted if you have no money.

193
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,840
Actually it is the other way round,

194
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,430
those who have money, you better never trust them.

195
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,980
And those who don’t have money are much more honest people

196
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,330
in this country than the people who have money,

197
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:49,170
who are all cheats practically.

198
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,440
So it happened like this and I said,

199
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,380
“No they are going to stay here!”

200
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,030
I put down My foot.

201
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:02,130
I said, “This house My father has given Me

202
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,490
and they are going to stay here.”

203
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:11,700
Poor things they stayed for a month in a very,

204
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,800
I think, must be very much embarrassed.

205
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,910
And while they were there so many Sikhs,

206
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:26,640
that time it was a big organisation – Sikhs and RSS were one,

207
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,330
and they came to My house and said,

208
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,760
“We’ve heard there’s a Muslim staying with you.”

209
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,160
There was a Muslim.

210
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,390
“And we’re going to kill that Muslim.”

211
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,170
I said, “What makes you think there’s a Muslim?”

212
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,770
“We’ve got reports.”

213
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:47,550
I said, “Wrong, there’s no Muslim in the house.”

214
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:53,400
I told him a lie.

215
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,310
So they said, “How are we to believe you?”

216
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,900
I said, “See I’m wearing a thing (bindi).

217
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,760
I am a Hindu lady.

218
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,650
How will I keep a Muslim in my house?

219
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:11,620
We’re all frightened of them and there’s no one like that.”

220
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,960
Somehow or other they believed Me.

221
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,140
I told a complete lie but they believed Me.

222
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:26,680
They had brought lots of those swords, with blood.

223
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:36,590
But I was not afraid and I told them in a very determined manner.

224
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,200
Anybody else in My place would have said,

225
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:48,120
“Alright, alright there is one you can take away.”

226
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:54,400
Then these three persons, who were there, left My house

227
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,950
and one of them is a very famous actress,

228
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,120
another one is a very famous poet

229
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,870
and another one is a very, very famous writer.

230
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,220
And it so happened that

231
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:16,130
they (a charitable organisation) wanted to make a film about young people

232
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:22,200
and I was the chairman of that, vice chairman of that,

233
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,370
and they wanted to call this actress.

234
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:27,810
I said, “Don’t tell her My name.”

235
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:31,040
Because I had lost her completely.

236
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,600
I’d just said let it be wherever they are, let them be.

237
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,520
There’s no, sort of, I never made any enquiries or anything.

238
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,750
“Don’t tell them My name.”

239
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,750
They said “Why?”

240
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:48,210
I said, “For some reason you just don’t tell her My name,

241
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,490
otherwise she’ll be compelled to say yes, which I don’t want.”

242
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,700
So when they went to her and asked her,

243
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,980
she said, “I must get a sari, I must get a chappal,

244
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,410
I must get a purse to match, I must get this,

245
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,120
all this you have to pay, plus so much money you’ll have to pay.”

246
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,280
They said, “Ours is a charitable.”

247
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,810
She said, “Whatever it is.”

248
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:14,370
I said, “Alright, give her whatever she asks for.”

249
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:20,210
Then I went for the opening ceremony and she saw Me

250
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:25,420
and she couldn’t control herself, tears started rolling down her.

251
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,490
Just came and fell at My feet.

252
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:33,410
She said, “How are you here after such a long time?”

253
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:37,480
So they said, “She’s the one who’s making this film.”

254
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
“What?

255
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,960
She’s making this film, why didn’t you tell me?

256
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
My God, my God.”

257
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,990
She couldn’t help it, she was crying, crying, crying, crying.

258
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,540
I said, “Now it’s alright.”

259
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,760
She said, “You take money from me.

260
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,360
I’ll pay for the whole making of the film.

261
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,100
You don’t know this lady.

262
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,490
You don’t know her.

263
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:02,910
What She’s done for me, nobody would do [what] she had done.”

264
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:09,330
She said, “She never told us anything how are we to know?”

265
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,980
Such a change that she, immediately she telephoned to her husband

266
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,980
and to this great poet, they all came running and they all…

267
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:24,720
But a small good gesture of administration:

268
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:31,170
that was My house given to Me by My father.

269
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,940
That time of course My husband and My brother

270
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:42,820
didn’t know how to trust people.

271
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,210
But I trusted them, fully.

272
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:50,590
They were saying, “They will cut your throat.”

273
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,590
“Why?

274
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,900
Why will they cut My throat?

275
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,080
For what?”

276
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,680
All kinds of funny things they were thinking.

277
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,880
And the worst thing I felt was

278
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:10,600
they were afraid because they had no money.

279
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,730
That is the beginning of the end, I think.

280
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:22,160
In our country this struggle for money started after that.

281
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,120
Without money people started suffering very much.

282
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,990
Poor people don’t mind because they are used to it.

283
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,730
Whatever money they have, they eat it and sleep off.

284
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:40,550
There were not also very, very poor people as they are today

285
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,680
but they were poor people no doubt.

286
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,720
But what I realised at that moment,

287
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,880
that the people who have any position or any power or anything

288
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:02,640
are literally frightened of everybody else.

289
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,290
This is the beginning of our downfall.

290
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:13,090
We got frightened.

291
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,180
Those who were in charge got frightened

292
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:26,390
that I may lose my seat or I may lose my money, I may lose my power.

293
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:31,720
That fright kept them absolutely mad.

294
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,770
Supposing I am left with no money.

295
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,500
So what?

296
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,230
What happens?

297
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:48,240
All these thoughts started coming after that partition, I felt it’s everywhere.

298
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,460
While I’ll tell you in My childhood,

299
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,190
My father never used to lock the house, it was a very big house

300
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,430
he never use to lock.

301
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,450
And we had a very beautiful gramophone

302
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,630
will all that horn sort of a thing.

303
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:11,550
And one day one thief came and stole that.

304
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:16,480
So next day we discovered, My father said,

305
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,060
“Poor thing, he was fond of music so he’s taken away doesn’t matter,

306
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,900
but he didn’t take the records now what will he use,

307
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,460
he must have records.”

308
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,111
So My Mother started teasing him,

309
00:26:29,111 --> 00:26:31,240
“Alright you advertise now.

310
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,360
The one who has stolen our gramophone

311
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,350
should come and take the records they are available for him.”

312
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,590
It’s so natural you know.

313
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,770
He just felt [that] we have money after all,

314
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,230
this fellow doesn’t have money

315
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:54,870
and he wants to listen to music you see.

316
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,790
So My father said, ‘Alright’.

317
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,270
Otherwise he was a criminal lawyer

318
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,460
My father knew law very well.

319
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,240
Was not a stupid fool

320
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:11,190
but he couldn’t understand this fellow has only taken gramophone only

321
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,470
without the records.

322
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,470
He said,

323
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:17,680
“he must not have found it, you see it was there kept and all that.”

324
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:24,340
My Mother said, “You better advertise it.”

325
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,290
He was a politician also.

326
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:34,740
So that time, the feeling among the politician was to

327
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,740
how to raise the standard of these people

328
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:47,659
who are not having what we are having.

329
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:56,170
All the people who had money donated lavishly to so many things.

330
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:01,080
I mean in My place there was one Rahbahadur Lakshminarayan,

331
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:08,630
he donated all his money, everything, to a big university.

332
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,930
Most of the things that happened in those days

333
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:16,160
were done by charity people.

334
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,500
I mean they never thought our children should have so much money,

335
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,220
crores and crores and crores.

336
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,950
They never thought like that.

337
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:30,960
Whatever limited money they had they wanted to donate

338
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,850
and do something good for others.

339
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:40,360
So when the Rajalakshmi, Lakshmi that is the one responsible

340
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,080
for looking after the benevolence of the people,

341
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:51,310
when She acts people think that they have,

342
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,800
not even think, they do it, automatically,

343
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,370
that they are there for benevolence.

344
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,380
They don’t have to tell themselves,

345
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:08,190
it’s just that they feel that it is their job,

346
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,990
this is what they have to do, is to look after the people

347
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:17,040
they are to be brought to better levels of life.

348
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:23,610
This is what they think, they don’t think like a party politics,

349
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:33,690
who is coming up, whom to kill, nothing of the kind!

350
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,540
Under the influence of the Goddess of Lakshmi,

351
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:47,520
which rules the political side we can say, the kingdoms and all that

352
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:54,980
– first thing is generosity, first thing is generosity.

353
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:02,880
For example, Mahavira was meditating and while coming out His cloth

354
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,670
– He had one cloth around His body, dhoti and He had covered himself.

355
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:15,090
And the upper cloth just got caught up in the bushes.

356
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,480
So he cut it out and came out with half the cloth

357
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,270
– it was in His own palace.

358
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:25,440
So Shri Krishna wanted to take His test.

359
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,330
He said, “See I have no clothes, I’m just naked.”

360
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,960
He came before Him like a beggar.

361
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,560
“You have this, why don’t you give Me this cloth?

362
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,650
You can go to your palace and wear your dress.”

363
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,870
He said, “Alright.”

364
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:48,580
He took it out and gave it to him.

365
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:52,390
And then He got some leaves and all that, covered Himself,

366
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,380
went to His palace and got dressed.

367
00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:01,460
But now these Jains, you know, they make His statue so big,

368
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,330
insult Him completely

369
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:17,200
by showing all kinds of nonsensical private parts to the details.

370
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:26,279
This is what is, where you have no worshipping of the Goddess.

371
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,690
Goddess is Shri Shobha!

372
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:33,520
She’s the One who decorates you.

373
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,920
She’s a mother.

374
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,510
She decorates you with ornaments,

375
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,560
She decorates you with beautiful clothes, She’s your mother.

376
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,740
She does it!

377
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:52,010
Like, Raja Janaka, He was the king so

378
00:31:52,010 --> 00:32:00,149
He had to wear ornaments, He had to wear beautiful clothes,

379
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:01,700
He had to do everything.

380
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,700
And when Nachiketa went to Him

381
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,980
he was quite surprised that why my guru has sent him to this king

382
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,350
who is wearing all kind of dresses and this and that and

383
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:14,100
he also had a big function of dancing and this.

384
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,930
He said, “He’s not a saint so why my guru touches His feet?

385
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:24,860
He’s a king.”

386
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:32,740
Of course Raja Janaka knew what he was thinking about.

387
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,950
He said, “Why have you come here Nachiketa?”

388
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:38,600
He said, “I’m here to get my Self-realisation.”

389
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,960
He said, “You can take all My kingdom

390
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,550
but not easy to give you Self-realisation.”

391
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:53,560
He said, “Alright, whatever you say I’ll do.”

392
00:32:53,560 --> 00:33:01,700
So He put a big sword on his head and asked him to sleep.

393
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:07,630
He couldn’t sleep at all.

394
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,090
Then they were having a bath,

395
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,770
he said, “Come and have bath in the river.”

396
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:18,090
People came and told that there’s fire and everybody’s running away

397
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,180
and Raja Janaka was in His meditative mood,

398
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,880
He was just sitting quietly.

399
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,580
Nachiketa got a little upset.

400
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,890
Then they said, “The fire is coming here

401
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,659
and all these cloths are going to be burnt.”

402
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:40,990
So Nachiketa ran out to save his things but still He was meditating.

403
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:45,810
Then they came out and Nachiketa found

404
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,279
that nothing that was burnt was there.

405
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,210
It was just an illusion for people.

406
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:58,240
He was amazed.

407
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,779
Then he realised what was wrong with him,

408
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:08,630
that he was doubting the Divine power Itself.

409
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:13,890
The one who was Janaka, who was a king,

410
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:17,840
was not bothered about His own powers, these are what?

411
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,870
Because he is today, this you have to do it.

412
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:25,320
Because I’m married, I have to wear a mangalsutra.

413
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,140
So this is for the parampara, for the tradition style,

414
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:46,100
but inside He was a saint, a very high…high level of saintliness.

415
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:56,900
When this thing happens that you get some position,

416
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:01,600
any power, even in Sahaja Yoga I was surprised.

417
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:09,230
If somebody becomes leader, I don’t know what happens to him.

418
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,230
It is a myth.

419
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,080
There’s nothing like leadership in Sahaja Yoga, nothing like that.

420
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,660
It’s just a myth.

421
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:24,330
But suddenly people jump up.

422
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:30,719
It is ego that gets pampered.

423
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:40,230
But this ego can be easily managed if you worship the Rajalakshmi.

424
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,840
She is the giver of balance.

425
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:58,600
Firstly, She rides on the elephant.

426
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,260
Is not easy for a lady to climb on an elephant,

427
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:07,450
I have done it, it’s not easy.

428
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:10,080
Without fear.

429
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:23,200
And She sits straight with a complete balanced attitude.

430
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,520
And Her blessings are tremendous.

431
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:43,840
The first blessing one gets: the imbibement of dignity.

432
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:49,300
Dignity of a king, dignity of a queen.

433
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:57,820
You are a queen, so you can’t behave like street women.

434
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:08,000
With Her blessing, first of all, you get that dignity.

435
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:17,480
That dignity is full of love, love for others.

436
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,870
That personality emits nothing

437
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:26,930
but love and benevolence for others, nothing else.

438
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:35,280
Wherever She looks, in every glance She blesses people.

439
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,290
She doesn’t expect anything.

440
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:43,660
She is a queen, what can you give to the queen?

441
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:48,220
She’s the highest of all in every way,

442
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,890
what can you give it to Her?

443
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,150
These, all these politicians and all these so-called presidents

444
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,370
of all these countries are beggars.

445
00:37:55,370 --> 00:38:02,510
All the time give me this, give me this,

446
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,910
like greedy people going around are beggars!

447
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:13,350
They are not the people who can rule.

448
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:19,780
Hankering after things.

449
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:26,400
So first thing is the sign, is that such a person has a personality

450
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,469
that just blesses people, thinks of their benevolence,

451
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:39,390
cares for each and every person who comes along.

452
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:49,090
This is a blessing of the Goddess.

453
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:53,430
Then the second blessing of the Goddess

454
00:38:53,430 --> 00:39:00,090
is that you develop a kind of a temperament,

455
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:09,020
which is very dignified, but also very humorous

456
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:15,160
and understanding what other people are like.

457
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,770
There’s a story of a king who was going on a horse

458
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,900
and he met a drunkard.

459
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,250
So you can say

460
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,990
these our drunkard can be compared to our politicians.

461
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,490
So the drunkard stopped.

462
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:36,380
He said, “I want to buy your horse.”

463
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,980
People said, “Do you know what he is?”

464
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,790
“Yeah I know he’s a king.

465
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,790
Alright.

466
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,790
So what?

467
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,790
I want to buy his horse.”

468
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:48,970
He said, “Alright not today, tomorrow we’ll sell the horse to you.”

469
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,030
So went away.

470
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,800
Next day he was called.

471
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,780
So he came with folded hands bent down.

472
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,960
He said, “What, you were the one who was going to buy my horse,

473
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,660
what has happened to you?

474
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,110
I want to sell it to you.”

475
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:14,500
He said, “Sir, the one who wanted to buy is dead.

476
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,230
I am an ordinary person.”

477
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:38,370
Such a personality, such solid personality I should say,

478
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,850
that anybody would have been angry, would have said

479
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:42,890
“Beat this man!

480
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:43,920
Throw him away!

481
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,670
He talks to me like this,

482
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:52,690
behaves like this.”

483
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:58,320
What the king said was remarkable.

484
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:07,209
Because he knew he’s drunk, he knew he’s not in his senses,

485
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:12,130
that’s why he’s talking.

486
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,090
Didn’t get angry with him,

487
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:17,130
he said, “Alright, come along tomorrow, I’ll sell you the horse.”

488
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:21,160
That’s only possible if you have this Rajalakshmi in you

489
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,730
otherwise you would never behave like this.

490
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:31,020
Now what about today’s politicians anywhere?

491
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:35,010
They even shoot people, they kill people,

492
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,300
they arrest them,they put them into trouble I mean,

493
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:50,930
all kinds of things they are doing.

494
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:58,250
Such people have no right to call anybody as criminals!

495
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,970
But we accept!

496
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:05,719
As in Hindi we say, “Aaj kal ka zamana hai aisa.”

497
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:07,540
(Such is todays world)

498
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:16,430
We accept it – all such people as our rulers.

499
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:23,780
Then Rajalakshmi is the one who stands on dharma.

500
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,810
She stands on dharma.

501
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:38,230
If there is some adharmi then she will not bless that person.

502
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:46,130
Adharmi is to be taken out.

503
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:58,670
But if he’s not, then he will go all out to save that person.

504
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:06,240
But if he finds he’s adharmi, he will not.

505
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:13,630
Is a kind of a divine discretion he should have

506
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:21,690
as to whom to be kind and whom to be punishing.

507
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:27,840
That divine discretion should be there in a person,

508
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,130
otherwise you can play into the hands of ten people

509
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:42,020
who are around you, teaching you something, doing something.

510
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:48,760
One day I was in My mother’s place Nandgaon,

511
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,720
and there was one gentleman who impressed our Yogi very much.

512
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,340
I just kept quiet.

513
00:43:55,340 --> 00:44:04,090
He was a big politician and he told Me,

514
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:08,520
“We have to do like this and we have to do.”

515
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,380
I said, “Alright, alright, alright.”

516
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:16,490
Then three, four professors from the university came to tell Me,

517
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:20,280
“Mother, he’s a politician, be very careful.

518
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,900
He’s a very bad man, you be careful about him.”

519
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,320
I said, “What do you know about him?”

520
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,190
They said, “He’s a politician.”

521
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:30,090
I said, “There are so many politicians.”

522
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,710
“But he’s not a good man.”

523
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,890
“But what do you mean?”

524
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:36,610
I said, “Now you sit down and I’ll tell you.

525
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:40,480
This man has eloped with the wife of a Brahmin.

526
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:48,699
He himself is not a Brahmin and this child is from him to her

527
00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:54,110
and how much he has deceived people everything I know.”

528
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,110
They were shocked.

529
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,110
“You know Mother?”

530
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,450
“Of course.

531
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:02,470
I know everything!”

532
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:12,780
“Then why do You allow him to come close to You?”

533
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,310
“Do you think he is close to Me?”

534
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:21,850
I said, “You are sadly mistaken.

535
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:26,330
But it’s nice he’s come to Me

536
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:30,990
because he’s been troubling people too much and I’ll correct him.”

537
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:35,070
While some people thought he was a great achievement we have got,

538
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:38,110
and some of them came to tell Me be careful of this man

539
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:45,250
without knowing what he was.

540
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:50,230
This kind of a divine discretion has to be there.

541
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:54,290
If a king does not have that divine discretion

542
00:45:54,290 --> 00:46:07,190
then he can punish the good and he may help the bad people.

543
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:11,260
But this divine discretion disappears when you are self-centred.

544
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,130
That’s the main point, is a complete detachment

545
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:18,719
about the power should be there.

546
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:20,630
Complete detachment.

547
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:23,880
Why should Rajalakshmi care for anything?

548
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:29,160
What does She get?

549
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,090
But now there are some who’ll pamper a person

550
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:33,570
this, this and that, and then they feel

551
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:39,810
“ah, we’re on top of the world!”

552
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:43,630
They just pamper, pamper and pamper

553
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:51,080
the ego of a politician and he thinks he is a very big man,

554
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:59,110
then in the election he doesn’t understand why he’s on the ground.

555
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:09,850
So with this self-dignity, self-knowledge, you know what you are.

556
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:12,110
Whatever you may tell Me, whatever you may say to Me,

557
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:16,060
I’ll listen, “Alright, alright, alright”,

558
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:23,010
but I don’t accept anything as something great.

559
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:29,420
Because if I am that, what is there to be great?

560
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:35,130
Now supposing this is a lamp here.

561
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:37,320
So is it great or not great?

562
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,430
It is a lamp.

563
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:51,730
So if I’m Adi Shakti, I’m Adi Shakti, So what?

564
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:56,140
If you are a king you are a king so what?

565
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,880
I mean if you are an impostor then you might feel your ego.

566
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,340
But if you are really the king then you won’t feel.

567
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:14,260
If you are under the influence of the Goddess

568
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:19,570
then that is the only thing you enjoy.

569
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:24,480
The rest of it is nothing.

570
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,260
Whether you have diamonds or you have silver

571
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:40,850
or you have anything makes no difference at all.

572
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:46,560
Now how people misuse the scriptures also one should see.

573
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,990
That, Rajalakshmi is sitting on the elephant alright,

574
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:57,110
so they should have all very big cars, you see.

575
00:48:57,110 --> 00:49:03,010
She’s sitting on the elephant because elephant is the highest animal!

576
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:10,430
Is very kind, very forgiving and has such a tremendous memory.

577
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:17,500
That’s why She’s sitting on an elephant.

578
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:24,410
She’s not sitting there to show off.

579
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:30,890
But She’s sitting there to see around, what is happening

580
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:39,540
avalokan, She can see around what is happening, to be at a higher place.

581
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:49,209
That’s why a king is made to sit on a higher pedestal.

582
00:49:49,209 --> 00:49:53,150
But the purpose is not to show off.

583
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:56,209
But the purpose is

584
00:49:56,209 --> 00:50:02,689
that from that state he can see others better,

585
00:50:02,689 --> 00:50:12,709
he can be watchful of others.

586
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,020
If somebody gets a high position

587
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:25,350
then they think they are the owners of that position.

588
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:36,570
This has all come because the brain has gone upside down I think.

589
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:40,680
How can it be?

590
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,600
Logically?

591
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:50,469
Now if you are this throne is given, alright, so with the throne

592
00:50:50,469 --> 00:50:58,820
I sit on this, but this throne cannot give Me anything,

593
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:04,650
I can give something to this throne.

594
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:08,930
The king has to think he is obliging all these things th

595
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:13,650
at he is sitting on them because he is a king.

596
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:18,590
On the contrary he thinks all these things are important because something is lacking

597
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:22,920
in him or what?

598
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,890
And that’s why when they come to do Raj

599
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:31,990
they start gathering things which are useless absolutely,

600
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:39,480
clutter up their houses, homes, everything with something that is useless.

601
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:47,730
All their dignity, everything, is itself a decoration on them

602
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,709
and to show that they are kings.

603
00:51:49,709 --> 00:51:52,040
Of course they are given a crown,

604
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:58,380
they are given a big necklace, they are to wear something here

605
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,380
because they are kings.

606
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:09,130
But these are not actually his decorations

607
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:15,790
but these things get decorated by a king.

608
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:21,510
For example, you get some lanky panky fellow from the street,

609
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:27,860
half starved, who is a beggar, say, for example,

610
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:35,420
and put those ornaments on him and all the dresses of a king.

611
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:41,060
Put him on the stage, everybody may start laughing.

612
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:47,370
Nobody will think that he is a king by any chance,

613
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:50,570
because he doesn’t have that dignity, doesn’t have that face,

614
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,990
he doesn’t have that body, he doesn’t have that mind,

615
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:55,980
he doesn’t have that wisdom.

616
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:59,870
So how is he a king?

617
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:07,219
Like, there was one king who tried to make his shoes of pearls.

618
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:09,790
But he’s so stupid looking, you know,

619
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:13,830
that when I saw the pearls I said,

620
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:19,110
“This is the man only who can think like this!”

621
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:22,230
So stupid he was to look at.

622
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:29,740
And was sure of these pearls being put on his shoes.

623
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:35,910
So there are many such things these days all of these stupid people are doing.

624
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:39,500
There are big, big cartoons coming out

625
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:45,480
and you can see for yourself how stupidly they live.

626
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:51,740
To Me it’s such a difference I tell you.

627
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,870
Such a difference.

628
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:56,700
To them all these things are so important,

629
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:04,080
which if they don’t have they’ll buy and put it.

630
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:13,290
I know of a gentleman who came with a garland to our program,

631
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:21,770
I mean to our dinner, I asked him, “Why are you carrying the garland?”

632
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:27,120
“See after all you see I was garlanded so I’m keeping the garland.”

633
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:31,200
We didn’t know what to do!

634
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,820
We Indians will never take a garland,

635
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:36,760
first of all, anybody gives you they’ll put it, except for the Gods.

636
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,340
They will take it out immediately.

637
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,950
Another lady who came to see Me and she said,

638
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:44,750
“I don’t understand these Indians,

639
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,590
I bought a garland, I put it in my neck

640
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:52,940
so they were all laughing on the street at me.”

641
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:59,670
Now you Indians understand this, how subtle it is, just see,

642
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:03,220
that you can’t put garland, you are not God.

643
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:08,000
You cannot buy a garland (laughing) and put it in your neck and walk out.

644
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,330
Innately you have to be that.

645
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:24,939
So the person who is innately a king has the blessings of the Rajalakshmi.

646
00:55:24,939 --> 00:55:27,840
Then what does She do?

647
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,780
What does She do to such a man?

648
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:35,380
What She does is first

649
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:43,230
his name is written on the hearts of the people whom he rules.

650
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:51,750
She writes it with her own hand.

651
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,330
They adore him,

652
00:55:54,330 --> 00:56:05,700
they admire him and they try to imbibe his qualities within himself.

653
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:13,070
Another blessing of Rajalakshmi is

654
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:23,000
that She grants a particular type of a body,

655
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:31,189
which has a coefficience, which gives vibrations.

656
00:56:31,189 --> 00:56:39,180
They may not be very selfish people

657
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:42,760
to make a big advertisement about themselves,

658
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,030
talking about themselves, this that.

659
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:54,760
But the way they are wherever they are, they show.

660
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:02,969
We had many like these in our times also.

661
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:08,449
Maybe that people didn’t accept them, maybe they are nowhere now,

662
00:57:08,449 --> 00:57:14,060
some new johnnies are looking to be more jumping.

663
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:19,330
But whatever name is written in the heart of the people,

664
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:24,439
are the people who are blessed by this Rajalakshmi.

665
00:57:24,439 --> 00:57:27,830
So what a politician has to understand [is]

666
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:33,420
that he has not to make money,

667
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:43,010
he does not have to have a big show about himself.

668
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:49,780
He does not have to do anything that is like

669
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:54,110
laundering the money from the country.

670
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:57,141
He does not have to kill others who oppose him,

671
00:57:57,141 --> 00:58:01,360
he doesn’t have to shout at those who trouble them.

672
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,290
But what has he to do?

673
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:05,710
He has to remember that.

674
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:14,350
“I am here for the fame of a good man.”

675
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:21,900
He should worry about the fame he will be leaving after his death.

676
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,780
He should see to it that his fame is safe.

677
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:38,209
For example, see Shri Rama who was a king of benevolence, no doubt about it.

678
00:58:38,209 --> 00:58:44,320
But His own wife when somebody challenged that

679
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:49,060
– “She has lived with Ravana and how can She be pure?”

680
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:55,270
He knew that She was pure, still He decided that He will ask Her to go

681
00:58:55,270 --> 00:59:05,280
because to keep the show, to keep the whole image of a king

682
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:10,670
and He sent Her away.

683
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:16,610
But nowadays you find somebody’s brother employed in America,

684
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:22,490
sister employed there and he has made, his uncle has made a big house

685
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:25,340
and his wife has accumulated so much money.

686
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:31,340
It is all going on.

687
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,410
Everybody will talk like that about that person,

688
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:37,010
that he’s just money oriented,

689
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:42,040
he just spends money on nonsensical things and he is just exploiting us.

690
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:49,460
Everybody will talk but nobody will tell him on the face.

691
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:54,689
So what you have to worry is about absolute correct character.

692
00:59:54,689 --> 01:00:00,660
These days this is another point.

693
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:01,660
Every politician

694
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:03,451
must have three, four keeps otherwise he is not a politician.

695
01:00:03,451 --> 01:00:08,910
Like we had Nawabs, we had one Nawab in Lucknow

696
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:10,140
who had hundred and sixty five wives.

697
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:14,760
He thought if he doesn’t have hundred and sixty five,

698
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:20,420
people won’t accept him as a Nawab.

699
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:24,490
So this is another inferiority complex

700
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:27,380
that you should have some women around you

701
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:36,010
so that people will say what a powerful man he is.

702
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:44,380
Now those days are gone now, now Satya Yuga has started.

703
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:53,660
In Satya Yuga I assure you anybody who is not blessed by Rajalakshmi

704
01:00:53,660 --> 01:01:03,130
will have to go to jail or will have to leave the seat,

705
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:08,570
will be thrown away or will be as they say,

706
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:11,110
“Doubly dying go to the waste, dust”.

707
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:14,100
It has to be.

708
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:20,860
They’ll be all exposed, whatever tricks they may try.

709
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:33,650
And they will have the consequence of being artificially the rulers.

710
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:46,020
But a genuineness is the sign that the queen of blessings,

711
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:54,350
the goddess of Rajalakshmi, is residing in that person.

712
01:01:54,350 --> 01:02:04,420
In Satya Yuga it will happen I’m sure.

713
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:08,950
But even in Sahaja Yoga I find people doing politics sometimes,

714
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:11,850
I was amazed!

715
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:17,380
People think politics means keeping groups,

716
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:23,280
making groups, telling things from here to there, there to there.

717
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,810
That shows you lack collectivity.

718
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:36,810
A person who is a Sahaja Yogi will try to cement everyone together

719
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:43,380
because the power lies in collectivity.

720
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:48,669
To break the collectivity for anything

721
01:02:48,669 --> 01:02:57,640
is very dangerous for that person as well as for others.

722
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:03,050
So now you have entered into the kingdom of God,

723
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:09,240
you are now sitting in the court of God Almighty.

724
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:17,199
Here, of course, as courtiers you have to dress up well,

725
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:22,270
sit properly, should take up your seats.

726
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:25,120
You have to be systematic

727
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:29,880
and above board because you are Sahaja Yogis.

728
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,680
You are not ordinary people.

729
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,700
You are special people.

730
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:42,560
How many people in this world are going to be Sahaja Yogi?

731
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:45,949
You are special people,

732
01:03:45,949 --> 01:03:56,780
so try to make yourself such beautiful instruments of Rajalakshmi

733
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:01,650
that people when they will see you they will vote for you

734
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:14,890
and tomorrow you will rule the world.

735
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:20,010
I do not want you to get out of politics or get in politics

736
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:25,870
but you have to first get the blessings of the Rajalakshmi

737
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:28,390
and then only you should understand

738
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:32,620
what’s wrong with our country, what we have to do,

739
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:40,100
what is the purpose, why do we want to become politicians,

740
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:45,800
what we have to do, we have to have plans, what is your project.

741
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:51,940
All these things now put your attention from yourself to outside.

742
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:55,720
Like, that day I received a letter saying,

743
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:00,010
“my father is sick and my mother is sick then my son is sick,

744
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:02,920
and this and that and that and that.”

745
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:08,110
Such people can’t do much.

746
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:10,050
When the war of independence started in India

747
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:13,199
we gave up our studies, gave up our parents, gave up everything,

748
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:16,060
we were very young people.

749
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:17,210
So now you have to know

750
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:23,510
that if you have to really take to politics

751
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:25,870
you have to have the blessings of Rajalakshmi

752
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:30,340
and for that you have to build up yourself

753
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:34,459
with that dignity, with that sense.

754
01:05:34,459 --> 01:07:40,850
I bless you from My heart that in every country such

755
01:07:40,850 --> 01:08:44,029
people

756
01:08:44,029 --> 01:08:49,379
will come up.

757
01:08:49,379 --> 01:10:43,819
May God bless you.
