1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,644
Today is the eighth day of Navaratri,

2
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:15,168
and it is great day for Sahaja Yogis

3
00:00:15,347 --> 00:00:25,684
because it is the most important time period.

4
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:36,458
That is, the seventh centre we have crossed
and we are on the eighth centre.

5
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:44,561
We need not think of the Goddess what She did on the eighth day,

6
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:48,819
we have to think today what we have to do within ourserlves.

7
00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:52,676
After crossing the seventh day,

8
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:57,081
after crossing the seventh chakra

9
00:00:57,617 --> 00:01:03,946
-that is the real ascent in your spiritual ascent.

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,617
What are we to do on the eighth one?

11
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:14,046
It’s so Sahaja that today should be Ashtami,

12
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:21,229
because that is the day the Goddess killed so may evil doers,

13
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:29,319
and devils and Rakshasas. She did it on Her own, alone.

14
00:01:29,518 --> 00:01:35,649
Now these evil forces are manifesting in human beings.

15
00:01:35,947 --> 00:01:39,498
They have spread out. They are within us.

16
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:45,430
So we all have to fight those forces within us.

17
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:52,509
The war is within ourselves, is not without.

18
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:57,152
First when you ascend the seventh chakra,

19
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:01,160
when you are on the eighth step,

20
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:06,829
you have to remember first
you have to fight those forces within ourselves.

21
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:12,386
You are all very intelligent people; bit too intelligent sometimes.

22
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:17,109
So whatever I say you may twist it,

23
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:22,505
and may try to use it in your own intelligence.

24
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:28,378
But it is not in your well-being.
It is not for your ‘hita’, for your good.

25
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:33,664
You want to use it because you think you are intelligent,

26
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:38,993
or maybe that you do not know that you are using it that way.

27
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:42,704
And that is what one has to know

28
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:45,550
that these forces are acting within us.

29
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,034
They act through our intelligence,

30
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,307
they act through our emotions,

31
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:55,144
and they act through our physical being.

32
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:57,621
So we have to be very careful.

33
00:02:59,283 --> 00:03:01,549
When you ascend into Sahaja Yoga,

34
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,155
we have to be very careful with our intelligence,

35
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:08,774
because intelligence has capacity to cheat itself.

36
00:03:08,984 --> 00:03:16,437
And it will cheat us, nobody else.
It is against us, against our own power.

37
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,663
So we have to be alert and see for ourselves.

38
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:24,415
So as soon as you enter onto the eighth step

39
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:27,271
you should start seeing at yourself.

40
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:33,819
Now, for example, when I say the mantra is “I am my own Guru”,

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,502
immediately the intelligence comes
forward to render its services-freely.

42
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:43,815
“Oh! I am my own Guru, why should I listen to anyone?

43
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:48,082
Why should I listen to any leader?
Why should I listen to anyone else who is elder,

44
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:50,011
who understands Sahaja Yoga better?

45
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,563
I am my own Guru!” It is the other way.

46
00:03:53,773 --> 00:03:59,494
Straightforward thing is that:
I am My own Guru. I have to correct myself.

47
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:05,909
I have to use this instrument of light to correct myself.

48
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:09,710
Now the intelligence cheats again:

49
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:14,291
“Mother said that if your feel vibrations, then it’s alright;

50
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:17,869
and I am feeling the vibrations, I am alright”. – Again cheating.

51
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:23,465
You are cheating yourself! What is the reason?

52
00:04:25,549 --> 00:04:29,695
The reason is very interesting.

53
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:35,291
I’ve seen that ordinary human being

54
00:04:36,204 --> 00:04:42,390
– in the West specially – are very much against themselves.

55
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:47,125
Like, I’ll give you an example:

56
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:53,395
You tell somebody that if you have to go to the station,

57
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:57,848
take this road and you’ll go straight to the station.

58
00:04:58,078 --> 00:04:59,868
But immediately he’ll say,

59
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:04,769
“But the problem is that
how can I go straight? My back is towards the station.

60
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:09,570
If I walk straight I’ll go in the opposite direction”.

61
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:13,182
Such stupid things! But they say it, all the time.

62
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:22,101
Now if you tell them that you can sell
your car better if you go to Germany, for example;

63
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,595
but they say, “There’s a problem, may be

64
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:29,761
the Germans may start their war again.

65
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:32,658
May be there is Hitler waiting for me, to kill me”

66
00:05:32,837 --> 00:05:37,877
— Any fantastic problem, that you can’t think of,
can come out of this modern brain.

67
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:42,323
And you are amazed how this man is against himself all the time!

68
00:05:44,438 --> 00:05:52,156
The whole built-up is like that because
before realization you are absolutely disintegrated.

69
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:56,819
Your heart is against your brain,

70
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,700
and your brain is against your liver.

71
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:06,561
This is the reason they have three types of wives;
one is a love affair,

72
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,724
one is a physical life and one a wife.

73
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:18,210
They are so disintegrated
that every cell can have a wife or can have a husband.

74
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:22,021
The nose will want another thing,

75
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,332
and the hands will do something else
and tongue will say something else.

76
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:29,624
When I met the western people,

77
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,225
I had to consult many dictionaries to understand

78
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,806
don’t understand why they behave in such a funny manner.

79
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:40,346
They are all the time against themselves.

80
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,645
So after realization this habit becomes even subtler.

81
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:49,024
So now they use Sahaja Yoga to act against Sahaja Yoga itself.

82
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:53,712
Sahaja is simple, is straightforward.

83
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,333
But they don’t want to have it in that way.

84
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:04,226
They must always do it in such a way that it is absolutely Asahaja.

85
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:09,775
There was a fellow in my house
who was suffering from left side problems.

86
00:07:09,938 --> 00:07:14,125
So I told him that you have to light a lamp

87
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:19,680
and then take out all your badhas every night.

88
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:23,668
And we had a big drum of oil in the house.

89
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:27,025
– He did not eat any food, he did not sleep.

90
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,040
He burnt all that oil in one week’s time.

91
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:37,402
He made all the blankets black, all the wall black,

92
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:40,976
he any burnt all the curtains!

93
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:47,643
When I came back after eight days,

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,200
I said what have you been doing?

95
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:53,644
–And he looked like a real bhoot!

96
00:07:53,804 --> 00:07:59,637
He said “I was driving out the bhoots.”
I said now this is the limit!

97
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:02,354
So he said, “Mother you told me”,

98
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:06,899
I said, “thank god you did not take
beacon light to burn the whole house!”

99
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:10,133
So I have to be very careful when I talk with you.

100
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:13,146
Whenever I tell you one thing, I tell you that

101
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:15,401
the other side of it also immediately,

102
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:19,594
 because I don’t want – if I tell you this side,
you go to the other side, to the other extreme.

103
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,799
So all this kind of this crazy madness, stupidness I’ve seen.

104
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:26,848
And today when I’m going to talk to you about discipline,

105
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:31,005
I must tell you “Discipline has to be Sahaja”.

106
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:34,339
Now what does that mean?

107
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:39,319
– That is first of all “face yourself”.

108
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:44,021
What I find, the western mind,

109
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,220
because of its ego cannot discipline itself.

110
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:51,449
If you tell them you have to discipline
they think I’m creating a military out of you.

111
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:54,068
In a way it ‘is’ a fight.

112
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:57,255
It is a fight with yourself.

113
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,072
But how will you fight if you have no discipline?

114
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:04,060
Now if I say, you have to get up in the morning, take your bath,

115
00:09:04,257 --> 00:09:05,993
and sit down for meditation;

116
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:11,729
in a Sahaja way you have to tell yourself plainly,
“Come along, now you have to get up in the morning”.

117
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:15,795
In a Sahaja way; the way you turn your wheels in your car.

118
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:20,870
So what you do, is to, I think, the whole night you don’t sleep.

119
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,678
May be this could be one extreme,

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,133
is not to sleep.

121
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:28,212
And get up at 2 O’clock,

122
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,216
disturb the whole house-hold,

123
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:32,907
fill your tub, and fill the whole house with water!

124
00:09:33,046 --> 00:09:37,708
And sit down in the water, and you get cold and sick.

125
00:09:38,364 --> 00:09:43,832
It is absurd! Why?

126
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,987
– Because you want to show-off.

127
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:51,205
Or may be you want to hurt yourself. Both things are wrong.

128
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:56,461
Whatever has to be done has to be done in the most pleasurable way.

129
00:09:57,007 --> 00:09:59,927
Either you will not wash the dirt,

130
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:03,907
or you will wash it such that all the cloth will be torn.

131
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:06,107
But today as I see the people

132
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:10,666
—of France, specially, the French Sahaja Yogis,

133
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,280
–I think the discipline is lacking.

134
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:15,736
I’m quite surprised at it.

135
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:22,620
The first thing it hits at is that you cannot manage within

136
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,251
a limited amount,–I mean money-wise.
It hits you at the money point.

137
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:28,524
Like in the room there’s light,

138
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:30,693
nobody will see that it is put off;

139
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,035
there’s also a switch to be put off;

140
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,416
–is a practical thing. I mean one must know.

141
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,916
And the bill is going up for nothing at all.

142
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:42,420
Is an irresponsibility, complete irresponsibility.

143
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:46,328
That it is the money that will be spent,

144
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:48,788
is just a waste; and for us

145
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:52,375
 it is important that we live within sensible means.

146
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,519
First I’ll be dealing with gross discipline.

147
00:10:55,724 --> 00:11:01,172
Now what happens,that if somebody says

148
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,057
why the light is on,

149
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:07,768
immediately they become very abstract, they say “I’m the light”.

150
00:11:08,057 --> 00:11:11,901
Then you should not have lights at all,
there’s no need to have light!

151
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:14,103
Save all the electricity, all the light.

152
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:17,636
You are the Sun, so you need not have any heating!

153
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:21,499
That is the way things are funny.

154
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:27,822
One must understand that
on the gross points we have to disciplined first…

155
00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:33,563
We are living in ‘France, not on Himalayas.

156
00:11:34,446 --> 00:11:36,787
So when you live in France,

157
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:40,537
we have to correct ourselves living in France.

158
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:46,894
Now the second gross point is
that there are many who are not working at all.

159
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:52,013
Is a hippy style life. Or they work for two days or three days,

160
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,513
and the rest of the time what do they do?

161
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:59,267
They say we meditate. Means what?
—they sleep and snore, that’s all.

162
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,325
You don’t need 24 hours to meditate.

163
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,321
You ‘must’ have jobs, all of you.

164
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,107
Regular jobs.

165
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:14,853
So many ladies I’m told don’t take jobs once they marry.
They say “let the husband do job”.

166
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:16,472
It’s very wrong.

167
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:19,110
If you have the child, it’s alright,

168
00:12:19,348 --> 00:12:24,527
for the time being. You all must work every day.

169
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,607
There is no day for when we can rest, really.

170
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:35,400
God created this world in six days and seventh day He rested.

171
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:39,335
But the eighth day what did He do? –

172
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,653
He started giving realization; relentlessly. Working hard.

173
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:48,047
Could you believe at this age of mine,

174
00:12:48,304 --> 00:12:51,459
within last 2 months how much I have traveled?

175
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:56,067
Every night sleeping at about 2 O’clock, getting up at 5 O’clock:

176
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:02,295
I went to America, came back from there, then throughout England,

177
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:06,632
the whole month I was traveling—from north to south,

178
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:11,811
east to west. Next month out to Switzerland, to Zermatt.

179
00:13:12,188 --> 00:13:20,541
Then to Austria, Munich. Then back to London.

180
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,310
then to Italy back to London, had a Puja there.

181
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:28,596
Again back to France. Again back to London.
I’ve to change my house,

182
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:35,798
pack up all the things, go back to India,
go to Hong Kong, go to China, come back.

183
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:41,041
Then look after your Ashrams in India. Six days. Again come back.

184
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:43,164
And then to America…

185
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,669
That’s the thing your Mother is doing at this age.
Last night we slept at 3.30.

186
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,603
But then they told us it’s one hour earlier.

187
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:53,622
So we said alright one hour earlier. So we slept at 2.30!

188
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:56,934
You have to make your body like that,

189
00:13:57,146 --> 00:14:00,848
you see that it can stand all kinds of discomforts.

190
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:04,200
You know in Sahaja Yoga unemployment is not allowed;

191
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:07,436
to take this money from the Government is not allowed.

192
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:12,995
You’ll be surprised; in England
we have maximum unemployment in the whole world,

193
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,206
but there is no Sahaja Yogi is unemployed.

194
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:20,729
Now you must all earn sufficiently to pay for your stay.

195
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:23,368
Nobody should be parasite.

196
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:28,031
Now the young people who are no educated,

197
00:14:28,428 --> 00:14:46,339
who have no other job than that of a labour class
—or we call it as the garbage cleaners

198
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,277
—must take some sort of specialization,

199
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,633
to some kind of a mastery, otherwise people think
that Sahaja Yoga is a group of beggars.

200
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:59,434
Beggars and unemployed and miserable people.

201
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:03,439
But you see, when you become your own Guru,

202
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:10,757
you think that all the Gurus don’t work;
their disciples have to look after them.

203
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:17,087
The Guru sits down in one place,
you see, and the disciples look after.

204
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:20,799
—But not your Guru! Your Guru has to work very hard.

205
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:25,032
So you have to be in the same pattern as your Guru is.

206
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,208
And to hear that “nobody listens,

207
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:33,874
you tell them anything they don’t do any work,
they are lazy-lumps”—is very sad.

208
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:39,110
Some people sometimes say that these are the set of lotus-eaters

209
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:45,334
or some sort of a set of beggars
or lepers who are suffering from horrible diseases.

210
00:15:46,352 --> 00:15:49,875
Then I feel extremely insulted, you know.

211
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,197
You are my children.

212
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,601
How people are going to have respect for you,

213
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:59,379
or for me, if you have no discipline?

214
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:04,153
For French I should say, they should take to “Mauna” means silence.

215
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:11,305
Once they open out their lips, they just go on like a bird,
I’ve seen: all the time chuck chuck chuck…

216
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:15,700
You should exchange with English, who never talk,

217
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,453
they need a bump on the head to talk.

218
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:24,454
You ask them ten questions, and they would not say anything,
they’ll just stare.

219
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:27,529
These two extremes I can’t understand.

220
00:16:28,164 --> 00:16:34,664
Now it’s better to keep quiet, or it is difficult

221
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,213
for us to say something pleasant to others.

222
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,987
So the first mantra should be,

223
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:46,650
“mother teach us some nice things that we can say to others”.

224
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:52,305
“what should I say nice tomorrow, or today—let’s say, today

225
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:58,178
—when I get up. What should I say?
What would give peace to others?”

226
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,270
—But not so.

227
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:07,039
It’s not never the mind thinks,
now, in the morning I’m going to start

228
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:12,793
with a big spoon, hitting everyone, “Get up, get up, get up”.

229
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:16,714
The discipline has to come from ‘within’ yourself.

230
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,936
Nobody has to tell you.

231
00:17:19,393 --> 00:17:22,060
And when somebody tells, you feel hurt.

232
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:29,531
So I don’t know how to tell all this that it goes in the heart

233
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:32,404
and doesn’t remain somewhere in the air.

234
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:37,599
The discipline of within is like fragrance of flower.

235
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:41,864
It gives you complete freedom,
and it gives complete freedom to others.

236
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:47,115
See, I would say, I have certain bad habits or good habits.

237
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:50,785
Supposing I have a key, which is very gross thing: key.

238
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,170
At any cost I will not put it here and there.
I’ll put it at the right place.

239
00:17:56,785 --> 00:18:01,804
So, if the key is missing
I’m sure it is lost by somebody else and not by me.

240
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:06,816
I’m sure about it, because I know myself very well,
I cannot put it anywhere else.

241
00:18:07,134 --> 00:18:12,193
Are you sure about yourself?
Because you are not disciplined, you are not sure.

242
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:14,931
Like I asked somebody “How are you”?

243
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:22,681
The person says, "mmmmm" french style. And Italian style...

244
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:32,264
Confused, I'm confused - Engilsh. Now, what is that?

245
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:37,562
Are you realized or not?

246
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:47,674
They’ve been very kind, you see, to me, they think.

247
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:54,181
Now the time is so short and you are going like this.

248
00:18:57,515 --> 00:19:03,963
What should I feel? So, today is the day when

249
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:11,545
your Mother took out the sword to kill all the enemies,

250
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:18,322
and you have to kill the greatest enemy
within your is indiscipline and irresponsibility.

251
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:25,857
Funny ideas people use to justify
their stupidity and their indiscipline.

252
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:32,127
I know of a Sahaja Yogi who
would never take a bath, –for a year at least.

253
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:34,432
And he was reported to me.

254
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:39,690
And when I asked him, "Why don’t you take bath?",
he said, “I’m detached”.

255
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:46,928
So I said you go and live in Himalayas with this detachment,
you see others are feeling attached.

256
00:19:47,602 --> 00:19:50,836
Other are feeling impossible to live with you.

257
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,756
You have to be kind to others.

258
00:19:53,993 --> 00:20:00,006
You have to neat and clean, is a very
simple thing that I have to tell you now.

259
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:04,252
All these are the signs of inner cleanliness.

260
00:20:05,026 --> 00:20:08,756
So we come to the subtler side.

261
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:14,487
And the subtler side of Sahaja Yoga is extremely simple.

262
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:17,344
Is Compassion.

263
00:20:18,436 --> 00:20:20,551
Is Forgiveness.

264
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:21,869
Is Love.

265
00:20:25,678 --> 00:20:31,563
But the greatest of all is the Service to God.

266
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,223
We are doing the work of God.

267
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,941
How can we be tired?

268
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:43,770
How can we be unhappy?

269
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,243
The dynamic is flowing through us,

270
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:51,013
that Compassion is so fulfilling, that love is so beautifying

271
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:55,715
that how can we not do it?

272
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:59,120
We should run to do it. But we

273
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:05,441
have to know that this love has a “tremendous” urge within itself.

274
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:08,437
For example, if you love someone,

275
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:12,128
if you have a child, how

276
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:17,405
worried you are about that child, how much you work for that child.

277
00:21:17,941 --> 00:21:20,937
If the compassion is manifested,

278
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:25,064
you will see the whole world is created out of that.

279
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:27,822
God has created this universe,

280
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:31,346
this world and you people out of

281
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:35,215
this Compassion only, just His compassion.

282
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:40,136
Somebody asked me one day,
“why did you take this headache upon yourself?”

283
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:42,409
This headache is so nice,

284
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,750
is such a beautiful burden,

285
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:48,242
because there are so many possibilities.

286
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:49,948
So one has to be optimistic.

287
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:52,689
But you will realize when you are optimistic,

288
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:56,093
you give lectures to others but not to yourself that,

289
00:21:56,252 --> 00:22:00,478
“ ‘I’ have to optimistic of improving myself.

290
00:22:00,995 --> 00:22:03,236
Optimistic in my own love.

291
00:22:03,752 --> 00:22:07,291
It’s so rewarding, it’s so joy giving”.

292
00:22:09,752 --> 00:22:16,617
Such people come up very fast, their Kundalini rises very fast.

293
00:22:17,232 --> 00:22:20,656
They don’t use Sahaja Yoga for fulfilling their ego,

294
00:22:20,895 --> 00:22:28,513
but they use Sahaja Yoga for fulfilling their spirituel accent.
It depends on how you want to use it.

295
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:34,131
So today on this day of Ashtami, which is a very powerful day,

296
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:41,127
you assume that power within yourself
that I can fight all these horrible diseases within myself.

297
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:47,603
And for others I'll have
Compassion and Love— I will have not others.

298
00:22:48,071 --> 00:22:53,646
This is the point we miss always.
They think “Mother is giving lectures to others not to me.”

299
00:22:54,004 --> 00:23:00,165
And that Compassion will bring forth the beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

300
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:04,015
There are certain divine laws.

301
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:10,491
And you cannot cross them.
If you cross them, I cannot help you at all.

302
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,248
Now if you say,

303
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:15,502
“That I put chillies in my eyes, they should not burn”,

304
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,902
I can’t help.

305
00:23:17,378 --> 00:23:20,445
Whatever are divine laws you must follow them.

306
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:23,546
Like in France if you drive on the right side, you’ll

307
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:25,639
jump in the river (gauche-french left)

308
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:31,634
Yogi: Gauche is left.
Shri Mataji: No, right.  Yogi: We drive right.

309
00:23:31,892 --> 00:23:34,215
You drive right?
Yogi: English drive left.

310
00:23:34,435 --> 00:23:38,137
So, I was saying that if you in France you drive right.

311
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,563
Then you are in trouble.

312
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,273
Yogi: do you drive right?
Shri Mataji: You drive right?

313
00:23:44,713 --> 00:23:54,710
I see. So here if you drive left, I will be in trouble I must say!

314
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:59,447
Because I don’t understand human laws so well!

315
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:05,845
Like in England different law, in France another law,

316
00:24:06,203 --> 00:24:10,718
 in America another law. Funny people.

317
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:14,096
But in God’s realm, everywhere the same law.

318
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,400
Whether you are in France, or England, or India, same law.

319
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:28,722
Whether on this earth or on the moon, or on the Jupiter, same laws.

320
00:24:29,205 --> 00:24:32,768
Whether in human beings, animals or nature, same law.

321
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:34,990
But you know the law.

322
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:39,931
You are the driver, so you have to be careful.

323
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,223
If the driver does not know driving laws, God save passengers.

324
00:24:44,475 --> 00:24:50,387
So one must know that these are the laws of the divine,

325
00:24:51,062 --> 00:24:53,494
that we have to live with self-respect,

326
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,953
that we have to be chaste, that we have to have dignity,

327
00:24:58,252 --> 00:25:04,003
that we cannot steal money and steal things and be parasites.

328
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:10,284
That we cannot kill others and we cannot beat others 
and say harsh things, they are just the same.

329
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:15,701
And that we have respect,

330
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,356
the respect for all that is sublime.

331
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:24,067
Respect for all the saints that are Sahaja Yogis.

332
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:30,653
And the respect for the leaders who represent you Mother.

333
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:37,153
With all this, we are very different people.

334
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:43,899
We are different race. We are virtuous, 
we are righteous and we are proud to be that way.

335
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:47,767
We are sure of everything. We know about every thing.

336
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:52,424
And we are personified

337
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:58,448
or we are personification of Compassion, of Love of God.

338
00:25:58,786 --> 00:26:02,773
That’s what we are. We are not ordinary people.

339
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:07,071
I asked a child, “Who is our friend?”

340
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:09,472
She said, “Only one”.

341
00:26:10,147 --> 00:26:14,075
I said, “Why?” “Because she is a Sahaja Yogini,

342
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,667
the rest are all ordinary people”.

343
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:20,801
What about the teacher?  “Very ordinary”.

344
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,638
And what about your Headmistress?

345
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:29,769
“She is absolutely ordinary!” 
Then I showed her the photograph of the Prime Minister.

346
00:26:30,653 --> 00:26:34,382
She looked at it and she was quite surprised.

347
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:39,454
She said, “this is even more ordinary than my head mistress”.

348
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:43,613
She said with great disgust,

349
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:47,393
“Mother why do you keep such photographs with you?”

350
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:55,117
That’s what we are. The children understand more than us, isn’t it?

351
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:58,540
Because our brain is against us perhaps sometimes;

352
00:26:58,739 --> 00:27:05,187
over developed brain. So yesterday 
I saw many people having Ekadasha, I was surprised.

353
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:08,758
So I told them just say, “Mother You be in my head”.

354
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:13,036
Because I have no intelligence. I’m too simple.

355
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:18,235
You should all become simple like me. Absolutely simple person.

356
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,342
 That’s very effective!
