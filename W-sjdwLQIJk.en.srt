1
00:00:01,754 --> 00:00:10,889
In Russia the people somehow are very
open-minded.

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,082
Not only that, the scientists specially

3
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:20,000
are very open-minded and were suppressed
very much,

4
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:26,625
so they tried to find out the subtler
things;

5
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:31,318
not only finding out about

6
00:00:31,886 --> 00:00:39,522
chemicals or about some physical properties
of the light,

7
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:44,971
but they wanted to go into the subtler
side.

8
00:00:45,172 --> 00:00:53,758
And they had find, found out already
a great deal of knowledge

9
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:58,700
about the auras – auras around the head,
auras around the body –

10
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:01,823
they had done so much of research

11
00:01:02,024 --> 00:01:06,470
and was accepted all over the world,
their findings.

12
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:09,791
Now this gentleman was a specialist,
I think,

13
00:01:09,992 --> 00:01:13,454
because he’s a very well-known, very,
very well-known person

14
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:16,314
 and he’s holding a very big position.

15
00:01:16,515 --> 00:01:21,240
He was saying that he was, he has to run
150 organizations –

16
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:24,472
very humble and very nice person.

17
00:01:24,673 --> 00:01:31,280
And when he came out with this discovery
I was happy in a way,

18
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:37,677
because scientifically if it is proved,
then nobody can challenge it.

19
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:42,555
He has already written a book with
all the algebraical complications

20
00:01:42,756 --> 00:01:47,958
of what he wanted to prove. And he said
there is a vacuum,

21
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,533
beyond the consciousness there’s vacuum,

22
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:55,473
and in that vacuum only you can know
the reality.

23
00:01:55,675 --> 00:02:00,385
And once all this becomes the reality
it is a science,

24
00:02:00,586 --> 00:02:03,404
and that’s how it is made into science.

25
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:06,374
He showed so many of My photographs,

26
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:10,055
specially the one where lot of energy
is coming out

27
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,333
of My Sahasrara when we are on a boat.

28
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:17,959
So he said, “She is the Source of all
the cosmic energy.”

29
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,935
And that’s what is Adi Shakti is:
She’s the one who creates everything.

30
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:32,412
The whole atmosphere that we know of
is very artificial,

31
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:40,029
but when you understand what She has done...
The first thing She does is to –

32
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,867
in My book also I have written down
about it, but I would like to tell you –

33
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:53,411
that Her first, should say, manifestation
is on the left-hand side.

34
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:57,531
That’s the Mahakali’s manifestation.

35
00:02:57,732 --> 00:03:02,982
So She comes on the Mahakali system,
the left-hand side,

36
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,670
and that is where She created Ganesha.

37
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:15,033
Shri Ganesha is created because His purity,
His innocence

38
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:22,337
and auspiciousness, this had to be created
before She created the universe.

39
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:28,594
So first thing She does is to create
Shri Ganesha, and She settled down.

40
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:32,324
Then She goes up, of course in the body
of the Virata,

41
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:35,497
and then She goes round and goes up

42
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:43,028
on the right-hand side in the other way;
and there She creates all the universes –

43
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:50,353
as you call them, bhuvanas. One universe –
there are fourteen bhuvanas –

44
00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:56,240
means these many, many universes made,
make one bhuvana.

45
00:03:56,441 --> 00:04:01,357
And She creates all these things
on the right-hand side.

46
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:05,988
Then She goes up and then She descends down,

47
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:11,019
creating all the chakras, Adi Chakras
or the peethas.

48
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:18,597
She comes down, makes all these peethas
and then She’s settled as the Kundalini.

49
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,405
But Adi Shakti is not fully the Kundalini,
we can say –

50
00:04:23,606 --> 00:04:30,969
Kundalini is, is a part of it. The rest
of the work is much more than this.

51
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,870
So the, all the, we call it the residual
energy – means

52
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:38,276
after going through all this journey, then
She comes round

53
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:45,380
and She goes as Kundalini. Because of this
Kundalini and the chakras,

54
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:54,454
She creates a area which we call
as the chakras in the body.

55
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:58,163
Now first She creates these chakras
in the head:

56
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:02,362
we call them the peethas of the chakras.
And then She comes down

57
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:09,502
and creates these chakras, which are
in the body of the Virata.

58
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:14,635
Now once this has happened, then She
creates human beings,

59
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:18,849
but not directly: through the evolutionary
process

60
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,856
She goes through, and that’s how
the evolution starts.

61
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:29,673
And then it starts developing from
the minute,

62
00:05:29,874 --> 00:05:38,024
small little microscopic organisms
in the water, and then it starts evolving.

63
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:42,281
So when She creates water and She creates
all the universes,

64
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:48,598
She chooses this Mother Earth as the best
place to play Her evolutionary process,

65
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:53,134
and there She makes this little microscopic
thing.

66
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:57,723
Of course I have written all about it, and
when My book will be released

67
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:03,113
you can see that how first hydrogen, carbon

68
00:06:03,314 --> 00:06:08,906
and oxygen and all of these things were
mixed up and how nitrogen comes into play,

69
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:12,218
and how a living process starts.

70
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:14,629
All this I have done it in My another book

71
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,899
that I am going to write now. I mean,
I have mostly finished,

72
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,956
but there’s some more chakras are to be
dealt with.

73
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:24,673
Now with this happening, you see,
one thing is there

74
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:27,948
that whatever I write, now people
won’t doubt.

75
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:33,835
They will know it’s a scientific fact, and
that’s what whatever I say is a fact.

76
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:43,527
Now to believe in the car… in the, even,
a Mother, Adi Shakti, was impossible.

77
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:46,955
Specially you’ll be amazed that Christian
religion

78
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:50,520
somehow or other avoided the mentioning
of the Mother.

79
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:55,975
Then the Islam, that also avoided
the mentioning of the Mother.

80
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:59,649
There’s completely negation towards
the Mother.

81
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:03,590
But only Indian philosophy had the Mother,

82
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:07,205
and the Indians are actually
Shakti-worshippers.

83
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:13,981
So this is how it was kept up and brought
to this position now,

84
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:20,203
that people have got, people have got
full idea

85
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:26,257
as to Mother Principle that has worked out
everything.

86
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,387
On this Mother Principle in India people
are very sure

87
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:35,194
that it’s the Mother who does everything,
and thus we have in India many,

88
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:42,344
we should say, many swayambus, means things
that are created of the Mother Earth.

89
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:47,636
For example, you know in Maharashtra
we have got Mahakali’s place,

90
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:55,294
Mahasaraswati, Mahalakshmi, and also
we have got a place for the Adi Shakti.

91
00:07:55,495 --> 00:08:00,745
Some people who have been to Nasik must
have seen Chaturshringi.

92
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:08,271
How many people have you been
to Chaturshringi, out of you? – it’s good.

93
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:14,489
So this Chaturshringi represents
the Adi Shakti:

94
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,879
Adi Shakti which is the fourth dimension

95
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,255
of this Power, which gives you the ascent.

96
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:31,136
And ultimately through Mahalakshmi channel
only, you get your realization.

97
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:39,781
All this is a process, all was created
by the power of Adi Shakti.

98
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:45,842
It’s a tremendous task. The previous ones
were not difficult,

99
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:50,679
because there, for nature to create,
was very easy.

100
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,699
The Mother Earth is one with
the Adi Shakti,

101
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,782
the whole atmosphere is one
with the Adi Shakti,

102
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,308
all the elements are one
with the Adi Shakti,

103
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:02,884
so She could create all that without
any difficulties.

104
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:08,452
But when human beings came, they got
their freedom.

105
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:14,083
That’s the only, I should say, the species
which fell into the maya

106
00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:20,854
of thinking and of having the ego in them.

107
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:25,175
With this ego a maya worked on them,
I should say,

108
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:32,151
and they forgot about the Principle that
created this universe –

109
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:37,213
they took it for granted. They felt that
this is their own right that they are there,

110
00:09:37,414 --> 00:09:42,576
this is their own achievement and they are
the owners of everything.

111
00:09:42,777 --> 00:09:47,795
This started working in their minds so much
that they invaded other countries,

112
00:09:47,995 --> 00:09:52,333
they destroyed so many people and they
never felt bad about it.

113
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:55,835
All their lives they have been thinking
about aggressing others,

114
00:09:56,035 --> 00:10:00,007
controlling others and doing all kinds
of harmful things.

115
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:06,666
But they never even thought or never did
any introspection to see

116
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:11,870
that what we are doing is very, very wrong
and it should not be done.

117
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:16,113
Because of the freedom they have, there’s
such a turmoil in this world.

118
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:21,648
And the people who were in charge
of affairs, they were very, very cruel

119
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:28,924
and extremely – had no feelings
for the other people.

120
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:33,423
And this happened so many times in the,
on this earth.

121
00:10:33,624 --> 00:10:38,921
Now Sahaja Yoga has started. Once 
Sahaja Yoga has started,

122
00:10:39,122 --> 00:10:46,914
we have Sahaja yogis who are now receiving
the blessings of the Adi Shakti directly.

123
00:10:47,115 --> 00:10:51,559
But still I must say, among Sahaja yogis
also we don’t have people

124
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,290
whom I would call as very well-matured.

125
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:01,723
They are Sahaja yogis, some of them,
are just because it’s a fashion;

126
00:11:01,924 --> 00:11:05,195
maybe it should be better from their angle,

127
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:10,034
or from their selfish angle or whatever
it is. Is a very wrong thing.

128
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:17,207
If you are in Sahaja Yoga you must know now
you are responsible for the whole world.

129
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:20,901
You are the only people who have
come forward,

130
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:24,388
you are the only people who have achieved
something.

131
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:28,518
And then at this juncture you should behave
in a manner

132
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:34,170
that, that behoves a big saint or
a realized soul;

133
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,960
but sometimes you find them behaving
in such a manner, is shocking sometimes.

134
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:43,941
They have no respect for themselves
or for others,

135
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:47,106
and their whole attitude is very funny.

136
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:51,138
Some of them are money-oriented, some
of them are power-oriented.

137
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:56,026
And those who are power-oriented are more
dangerous, I think, than money-oriented;

138
00:11:56,227 --> 00:12:03,860
because those who are power-oriented try
to bring such bad name to Sahaja Yoga.

139
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:08,532
They are very insulting, dominating and
horrible people.

140
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:15,456
Their whole attitude is to achieve power
in Sahaja Yoga, and they try all tricks

141
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:20,178
to achieve that power. But for some time
they, they look all right –

142
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:25,645
after some time you’ll find they’ll all
disappear from the field of Sahaja Yoga.

143
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:31,463
It’s a very big cleansing process going on. 
You must understand that you have come

144
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:41,789
in the, in the field of very high
consciousness

145
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,579
where you are in contact with the Divine.

146
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,892
Now here if you behave like ordinary people

147
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:54,595
who have no divinity within them, how long
will you continue like this?

148
00:12:54,795 --> 00:13:01,588
So this is very important that you should
try to meditate and evolve yourselves,

149
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:05,903
and become really very good Sahaja yogis.

150
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:10,853
In some places we are very, very lucky. 
In some, some countries we are

151
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:14,137
very, very lucky. But in some countries
I find

152
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:18,938
the people are just deaf and dumb.
They can’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

153
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,791
For My program they do come, and
afterwards just they disappear.

154
00:13:23,992 --> 00:13:29,419
This one I think is also – Sahaja yogis
are responsible for this.

155
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:37,124
The way they go about, the way they want
to do Sahaj work is not Sahaj.

156
00:13:37,325 --> 00:13:41,724
Must be something definitely wrong with
the whole thing, and that’s why

157
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:47,749
it’s not working out the same way as
it is working out in many places.

158
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:53,882
So I have to tell you that all this is
there, that Adi Shakti is there,

159
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,565
and all this has happened through
Adi Shakti.

160
00:13:56,766 --> 00:14:01,163
But now the further work has to be done
through you people

161
00:14:01,364 --> 00:14:06,887
because you are the channels, you are
the one who have to transform people.

162
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:15,729
Now everybody should understand and know
how many people we have given realization.

163
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,973
We have to think about it: what have
we done for Sahaja Yoga?

164
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:24,539
Once I was traveling by plane and I saw
it was so –

165
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,657
met a lady who was sitting next to Me,
and she was so hot, I couldn’t understand.

166
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:32,927
Then she told me she is a disciple
of a guru

167
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:37,215
and very proud of it, and she started
telling Me all about him and things.

168
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:41,657
I was amazed, that look at this woman,
she hasn’t got anything from him

169
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:44,437
and she was just saying, “I have given
so much money to him,

170
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:47,224
I have done this thing to him,” and all
those things.

171
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:51,955
But she had nothing, and despite that she
was talking to Me,

172
00:14:52,155 --> 00:14:54,771
a stranger person, about the guru.

173
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:58,356
But in Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen people are
rather shy.

174
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:02,074
They don’t want to talk about Sahaja Yoga
openly to others,

175
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:07,826
which is a very wrong thing you are doing
because you are responsible for this work.

176
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:12,578
You have been given realization – of course
you were seeking, everything is all right –

177
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:17,187
but all of you must try to give
realizations to others.

178
00:15:17,387 --> 00:15:23,272
I must say that somehow men have been
more dynamic and working it out.

179
00:15:23,473 --> 00:15:28,332
The women in Sahaja Yoga are not yet
coming up to that level as they should.

180
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:32,685
They have to be more sensible about it,
and they have to work it out.

181
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:36,308
They can do it, but only trouble is,
I think they have

182
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:40,966
certain minor problems about which
they are worried.

183
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:44,564
Always I get letters from ladies saying
this is wrong,

184
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:48,425
that is wrong, complaining all the time;

185
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:50,960
when I’m so fed up of their letters now

186
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:56,876
that I think they’re useless to read them
also. So I have to tell you all,

187
00:15:57,077 --> 00:16:01,964
that it is important that men, because
they are dynamic,

188
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:08,284
women should be much more, because they are
shakti and I am a woman.

189
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,287
So I find that the men are more sort of
active and dynamic

190
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:18,886
about Sahaja Yoga, and I don’t know what is
the reason why women are not.

191
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:24,425
They can transform so many people.

192
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:31,376
They can do so much good to others. They
can bring so much love and compassion,

193
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:37,788
because this love and compassion is
a quality of a mother, of a woman.

194
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:42,832
And if the women don’t have that quality,
it’s useless to be a woman.

195
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:48,559
All the time if you are busy about your
useless things

196
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,184
like fashions or faces and all that, then
the time is all wasted.

197
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:57,522
You have a short time now, you’ve got
your realization

198
00:16:57,723 --> 00:17:03,324
and you must decide what have you done
so far, what have you achieved for so far.

199
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:07,176
But I would say that also in Sahaja Yoga
I’ve found

200
00:17:07,377 --> 00:17:13,733
there are all kinds of funny ideas growing
here. Like certain rituals they’ll take up.

201
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:17,485
Then they prescribe certain rituals,
they’ll talk about it.

202
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:23,003
And kind of a power-orientation is there.
They want to oppress others,

203
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:26,553
and they want to take over and frighten
people

204
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:32,785
and behave in such a manner that, as if
they are very good.

205
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:38,776
Some of them start saying that “Mataji
said so. This is Mataji’s ideas.”

206
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:46,650
By their own power-orientation they
manufacture things and talk like that and…

207
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:50,281
But ask them, “How many have you given
realization?”

208
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:54,284
The first thing is, you must determine
is positivity:

209
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:56,786
how many you have given realization?

210
00:17:56,987 --> 00:18:02,156
Is just talking about others, criticizing
others, talking about

211
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:07,075
the defects of Sahaja Yoga, seeing
in the Sahaj Yog;

212
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:11,365
is I would say, is still a very preliminary
things

213
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:15,775
that have happened before, and it should
stop.

214
00:18:15,976 --> 00:18:18,968
Now as it is, once this book is out,

215
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:25,004
all over the world it will be known about
our work; we’ll be not challenged any more.

216
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:33,225
But still we have to see for ourselves that
if we have achieved

217
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:38,284
this kind of recognition then we should
be up to that,

218
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:43,455
our capability should be up to that.
We should not be lagging behind.

219
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:48,885
For example, if you ask some Sahaja yogis,

220
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:52,735
specially Sahaja yoginis, they don’t know
much about Sahaja Yoga,

221
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:57,461
they don’t know about chakras, they don’t
know anything about the deities;

222
00:18:57,662 --> 00:19:01,179
nothing they know – how can they be
Sahaja yogis?

223
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,401
You have to know all about it. Only thing
that you don’t realize,

224
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:12,390
that it’s not outside that you are a Sahaja
yogi but it is inside.

225
00:19:12,591 --> 00:19:18,367
Inside you have to have that kind
of an understanding of the chakras

226
00:19:18,568 --> 00:19:24,301
and of Sahaja Yoga, how it works,
how it helps you.

227
00:19:24,502 --> 00:19:31,254
Now supposing if I’m the Source of that
energy, which you know very well I am,

228
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,478
then you achieve yours also, a kind
of a perfection about

229
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,587
dealing with people and bringing them
to Sahaja Yoga.

230
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:49,183
Is a very important work you have to do,
is to bring Sahaja yogis in Sahaja Yoga.

231
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:54,506
What I find that some people are very much
still lagging behind,

232
00:19:54,707 --> 00:20:00,911
and it’s very surprising that they live
in that country,

233
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:04,851
they are part and parcel of that country
and they are not bothered.

234
00:20:05,051 --> 00:20:09,426
Under these circumstances they’ll be
blamed, that “Why didn’t you do?

235
00:20:09,627 --> 00:20:17,245
Why didn’t you find out the ways and methods
of convincing at least your countrymen?”

236
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:22,163
So Sahaja Yoga at the brink of growth

237
00:20:22,364 --> 00:20:25,205
cannot grow only with one country or two
countries;

238
00:20:25,405 --> 00:20:29,940
all the countries have to be brought
into Sahaja Yoga.

239
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:38,361
All the people that we could call into
Sahaja Yoga will be a very good idea.

240
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:44,211
And then we have books to convince people,
we have to talk to them about it.

241
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:48,531
But what I find about Sahaja yogis,
that once they start

242
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:51,760
spreading Sahaja Yoga also their ego
comes up,

243
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:56,047
and this thing – they are very great Sahaja
yogis, they are great leaders –

244
00:20:56,248 --> 00:21:01,469
all this kind of stupid ideas walk into
their heads, which is wrong.

245
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,987
You have to just think in a very humble
manner.

246
00:21:05,188 --> 00:21:08,365
The more you have, the more you become
humble,

247
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:12,842
 like a tree when laden with fruits,
bends down.

248
00:21:13,043 --> 00:21:16,442
In the same way you have to be very humble.

249
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:20,708
But that humility is sometimes very
difficult,

250
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:24,100
because the culture of the West is not
humble culture –

251
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:31,791
it’s a culture of aggression, culture
of domination. So far they have been,

252
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:35,955
they think because of domination they could
go all over the world,

253
00:21:36,156 --> 00:21:39,163
they could achieve so many things.
What have they achieved?

254
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:43,868
Nothing. In their own countries if you see,
there’s drug addiction.

255
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,363
Why should people take to drugs so much?

256
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:50,987
Then all kinds of sinful things they do
which I don’t want to mention,

257
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:56,445
but you know what they are doing – which
in India, which is a poorer country,

258
00:21:56,646 --> 00:22:00,855
one cannot even think of. Such things
are happening around you,

259
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:03,365
so find out what’s wrong where

260
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:08,310
and how you can correct these things,
if you can help them.

261
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:13,591
Actually now, as I told you, I am going
to start some sort of organizations

262
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:17,610
that will do good to human beings.
But you all can join also.

263
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:21,742
You can also start in your own countries
something like that.

264
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:26,985
But first you have to get rid of your ego.

265
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:32,530
See, that once happens to you, then only
your attention would be steady.

266
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:37,063
And this ego is very simple for you because
you worship Christ,

267
00:22:37,264 --> 00:22:42,390
and the Christ is the one who was settled
on the Agnya chakra.

268
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:46,758
You all worship Christ, but that humility
of Christ is not there –

269
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:50,220
just the opposite of it. It has happened
everywhere

270
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:54,936
that whatever is preached in the religion,
people did just the opposite of it.

271
00:22:55,137 --> 00:22:58,442
For example Hindu religion, I would say
Hindu philosophy

272
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:02,728
is that in everybody resides the spirit.

273
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:06,424
Now in everybody if there is spirit,
then how can you have

274
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:11,866
different caste systems, and how can you
have somebody higher and lower?

275
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:16,708
Other way round, now Christ has said that
you have to forgive,

276
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:20,005
forgive everyone, and you have to humble 
down.

277
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:23,855
And that’s what one finds, that among
Christians

278
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:28,136
they don’t know humility, they have no idea
of humility.

279
00:23:28,356 --> 00:23:33,263
Men are like that, women are like that,
and the men and women then go on fighting.

280
00:23:33,464 --> 00:23:37,745
There’s no question of anybody being
humble, peaceful and all that.

281
00:23:37,945 --> 00:23:40,683
So it’s very artificially they are

282
00:23:40,884 --> 00:23:43,801
showing off that they are very
philanthropist and all that,

283
00:23:44,002 --> 00:23:47,798
but inside in their heart I don’t find
there is any love,

284
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:51,152
there’s any compassion in the real sense
of the word.

285
00:23:51,353 --> 00:23:55,604
So when we are dealing with reality,
we have to know that we cannot just

286
00:23:55,805 --> 00:24:01,745
go on doing things which are artificial,
which are befooling others,

287
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:06,213
but we have to really become that. 
Once if you become that,

288
00:24:06,414 --> 00:24:11,503
when you are really like that, then only
you have done the job

289
00:24:11,704 --> 00:24:18,274
for which you are born at this juncture
of blossom-times.

290
00:24:18,475 --> 00:24:24,741
Otherwise you could have been born earlier
and could have been something different.

291
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:28,304
But you are specially born so you realize
your value,

292
00:24:28,504 --> 00:24:33,124
realize yourself what you are and try
to understand,

293
00:24:33,324 --> 00:24:38,215
have a self-respect, and try to do things
which are very important

294
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:44,119
as Sahaja yogis. Of course you are doing
a job, you are doing other things;

295
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,494
but you’ll be amazed, if you do work
of Sahaja Yoga

296
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:52,245
 you will find more time for everything.
Once you start doing God’s work,

297
00:24:52,446 --> 00:24:55,587
God does your work. And that’s how
you’ll be amazed

298
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:59,540
how you get so much time to do
the right thing.

299
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:06,294
Now it is for you to go back and
introspect, see for yourself.

300
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:09,368
Now the Adi Shakti Herself has come.

301
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:13,054
But I’m very simple, I’m very simple
to look at;

302
00:25:13,254 --> 00:25:19,813
in My behavior I’m very, very humble,
and people take Me for granted.

303
00:25:20,014 --> 00:25:23,596
I don’t do anything. I don’t want to punish
you, I don’t want to do anything like that.

304
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:27,529
But you yourself get punished, you yourself
become useless

305
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,875
if you do not look after yourself
and grow yourself.

306
00:25:32,076 --> 00:25:37,614
This finding is so great, and this man
had never known Me before.

307
00:25:37,814 --> 00:25:43,569
He’s very learned but he’s very humble,
and what he told Me that,

308
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:48,496
“Just imagine, I’m sitting before 
the Creator of this world

309
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:51,086
and still I’m very normal.”

310
00:25:51,287 --> 00:25:54,056
So I said, “What should happen to you,
what do you think?” So he said,

311
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:58,139
“Mother, it’s a big thing to realize that
I am sitting before You,

312
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:04,488
and that You are here.” I said, “It’s good
that you don’t feel My presence

313
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:10,820
so oppressive or so dominating.
I’m very happy.”

314
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:16,785
“No,” he says, “I just feel the love, just
feel the compassion". That’s what it is.

315
00:26:16,986 --> 00:26:21,330
We have to know that we should have
just love and compassion;

316
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:24,604
compassion and love for ourselves

317
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:28,766
in the way that we should not harm
anybody’s heart.

318
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:33,907
To say something to hurt someone
is very sinful.

319
00:26:34,108 --> 00:26:38,262
But some people enjoy that very much, they
think they are very clever – it’s not so.

320
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:45,585
When you talk to someone you must say
something which is very soothing and good.

321
00:26:45,786 --> 00:26:48,994
Another thing is the temper of a person,
is a temper –

322
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:53,023
that a slightest thing here and there,
they get into tempers.

323
00:26:53,224 --> 00:26:56,924
Now this has to be told, this temper, that
“You keep quiet.

324
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:59,776
I have nothing to do with you.”
That is one thing.

325
00:26:59,977 --> 00:27:07,443
Then there are people who are very subtly,
I should say, power-oriented, very subtle.

326
00:27:07,644 --> 00:27:11,629
They have tricks and trades by which
they know how to control others.

327
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,537
What are you going to gain out of it?

328
00:27:14,738 --> 00:27:18,375
What is your gain? By doing all
these things what will happen?

329
00:27:18,576 --> 00:27:23,213
In these worldly things you might be
little bit popular,

330
00:27:23,414 --> 00:27:28,933
little bit having a position or something;
but what is it, after all?

331
00:27:29,134 --> 00:27:32,728
That is not going to help you. What is
going to help you the most

332
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:38,850
is to make yourself a perfect channel
for Sahaja Yoga, to be a perfect channel.

333
00:27:39,051 --> 00:27:44,317
In that you will be amazed how you’ll
be helped.

334
00:27:44,518 --> 00:27:48,218
So I would say for you people who are
in the West, I would say

335
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,814
you must develop humility. It’s very
important.

336
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:55,857
I was surprised, in Russia itself
the people are not only humble,

337
00:27:56,058 --> 00:28:01,603
but such dedication, such dedication –
unbelievable!

338
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:06,203
They don’t even raise their eyes to Me.
I don’t know how they got this idea.

339
00:28:06,404 --> 00:28:09,819
This is not after the discovery, but even
before that.

340
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:16,697
They were so nice and so humble and
so full of love; and even the children

341
00:28:16,898 --> 00:28:21,836
brought Me small, small presents,
you know, just to give Me, so sweetly.

342
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:25,836
This is something surprising how these
people in Russia

343
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:29,713
have achieved that capability to become.

344
00:28:29,914 --> 00:28:34,019
And I think in the West, Russia is
the country

345
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:38,135
which will achieve a very great height
in spirituality,

346
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:41,289
and that means they’ll be the most powerful
people.

347
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,237
Let us see what you are doing in your
own country

348
00:28:44,438 --> 00:28:46,573
and how you are going to work it out.

349
00:28:46,774 --> 00:28:50,455
See, there are so many things you can do
very easily,

350
00:28:50,655 --> 00:28:55,230
if you see for yourself that you are
the instrument of the Divine.

351
00:28:55,431 --> 00:29:00,021
And then your temperament will change,
the nature will change;

352
00:29:00,222 --> 00:29:05,918
you’ll become a very, very sweet person,
likable person,

353
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:11,333
and everybody will think that this is
a saint walking around.

354
00:29:11,534 --> 00:29:15,689
So that’s all I have to say about this. 
Whatever is the discovery

355
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,552
is not a discovery for Me, but discovery
for the whole world.

356
00:29:19,753 --> 00:29:28,266
And I’m sure once it is established and
is exposed to the whole world,

357
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,692
things will change for you, and for Me
also.

358
00:29:31,893 --> 00:29:34,990
May God bless you.
