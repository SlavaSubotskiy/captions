00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,810
now first before meditate in your heart

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:41,920
you should see in your heart and they

4
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:41,920
try to put your guru in the core of it

5
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:54,190
after establishing in the heart you must

6
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,190
bow to that

7
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:05,500
with full devotion and dedication now

8
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:11,150
whatever you do with your mind after

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:15,940
realization is not imagination because

10
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:23,600
now your mind your imagination is itself

11
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:28,700
enlightened so project yourself in such

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:33,580
a way that you humble down at the feet

13
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,580
of your guru

14
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,930
and now Oscar

15
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:57,400
the necessary temperament needed for

16
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:02,720
meditation or atmosphere needed for

17
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:11,300
meditation meditation is when you are

18
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:16,610
one with the divine now if there are

19
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:19,730
thoughts coming in first you have to say

20
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:26,870
the first month of course and then watch

21
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:31,190
inside also you must say mantra of

22
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:34,420
Ganesha will help some people and then

23
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,420
you should watch inside

24
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:49,680
and see for yourself which is the

25
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:49,680
biggest hurdle what's the thought

26
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:59,489
now for the thought you have to say the

27
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:05,540
mantra of nearly Chara that Thomas

28
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:09,420

29
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,959

30
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,959
say twice

34
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,160
now we come to the hurdle of your ego

35
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,840
because see your thought has talked now

36
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,850
no doubt but there's still the pressure

37
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:05,190
on the head so if it is ego you have to

38
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:07,880
say so many Versace ah ma ahankara not

39
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:12,330
meet the great Ankara means the evil

45
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,820
now even now if you find that ego is

46
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:09,520
still there then you have to raise your

47
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:12,340
left side to push it back to the right

48
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:19,570
hand side with your hand one hand

49
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:22,780
towards the photograph push the left

50
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:26,910
side higher and right side door so the

51
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,910
ego and super-ego get the balance

52
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:42,760
do it seven times try to feel how you

53
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,760
are feeling inside is

54
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:06,290
now you raise your Kundalini up on the

55
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:13,180
head and tighten again raise your

56
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:13,180
Kundalini up on the head and tighten

57
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:32,360

58
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:35,169

66
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,140
see that you are stationed there once

67
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:47,190
