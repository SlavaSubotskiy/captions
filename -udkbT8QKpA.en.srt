1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:09,790
We have sometimes heard about people who get 
a hunch.

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:18,980
Like somebody says, “I must buy this house, 
I get a hunch that I should buy it."

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:27,730
Or sometimes people say that, “I always 
hear something, somebody tells me that this

4
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,850
should not be done."

5
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:46,710
But all such suggestions must be judged that 
they come to you to tell you about something

6
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:57,469
of the beyond or something that concerns the 
mundane life, like buying a house.

7
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:07,439
God is not interested, very much, in what 
house you buy, or how much money you make

8
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,100
in a race: He is not!

9
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,389
Because it is not important to God.

10
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:14,810
One can understand that, isn’t it.

11
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:21,070
Also that God is not interested in telling 
you against someone in the ear that, “Beware

12
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,240
of this man, he is a dangerous guy!”

13
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:35,450
For, if somebody is going to harm you physically, 
maybe to some part, we can say that God wants

14
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:43,759
to preserve your body; but this body is also 
not so important to God, because He can create

15
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,169
it again!

16
00:01:47,169 --> 00:02:06,099
The most important thing that God has to give 
us is His love, His connection with us, His

17
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:11,410
Kingdom, His powers.

18
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:19,840
So, the subtleties which we should really 
accept within us, should be [those] which

19
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:30,300
take you to the realm of joy, to the realm 
of collectivity.

20
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:37,980
Like suddenly you see a little child weeping 
on the street and you feel [that] your heart

21
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,980
is weeping.

22
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:46,819
Not that you feel guilty about it but you 
feel one with the child and you feel you are

23
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:55,569
weeping: then definitely that subtlety of 
compassion that God is, is felt within you.

24
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:03,620
But you don’t feel guilty about it, or you 
don’t give him 2p (£0.02) or something

25
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,290
to insult his ego.

26
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:14,019
You do something very constructive about it, 
extremely constructive, and you do it secretly;

27
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:21,040
you don’t like to tell anybody about it 
because you think it is vulgar to talk about

28
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,849
your compassion.

29
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:29,459
You do it so sweetly that the other fellow 
doesn’t feel it.

30
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:38,420
The whole act is such a beautifying thing.

31
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,200
You don’t announce it in the paper and you 
don’t publish it in “Who’s Who” or

32
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:51,249
you do not go for a Nobel Prize or something 
like that.

33
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:58,459
This is all very vulgar for the Subtle Thing 
that you worship within yourself, because

34
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:07,739
that element within you is so much higher 
than all these gross considerations that you

35
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,830
just care for that.

36
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,170
That is what God is.

37
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:19,019
That’s how God shines within us, even before 
our Realisation, before our connection with

38
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,289
God.

39
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:28,740
He shines in some people even before they 
have been Realised.

40
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:40,180
You see them, they are quiet people, they 
are not show-offs, but they are very sincere,

41
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,330
extremely kind-hearted.

42
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:53,000
Such people when they face Sahaja Yoga, immediately 
they get their vibrations.

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,389
They are not people who are worried about 
money, or they are worried about the gross

44
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:13,400
things of life, or achievements that are so 
stupid.

45
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,940
Such people may exist as very ordinary people; 
they need not be at the helm of affairs [and]

46
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,629
mostly they are not, because they are not 
ambitious.

47
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,440
They do not want much success in life.

48
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,850
They don’t see any point in being very successful.

49
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,660
They might be something very ordinary.

50
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,500
They might be doing something very important 
also.

51
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:50,349
But in their life, those who come in contact 
with them, remember that: “Yes!

52
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:54,669
There was a life or there is a life.

53
00:05:54,669 --> 00:06:02,840
Definitely there is a spark."

54
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:10,630
Because such a person being so subtle does 
not assert.

55
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:17,909
Such a person cannot be very dominating, assertive, 
argumentative.

56
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:33,159
Such a person is quieter: his attention recedes 
from all quarrels and all squabbles of life.

57
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:42,380
But such a person has a great position in 
the domain of God.

58
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:57,819
That you have seen, how in Sahaja Yoga suddenly 
you find people manifesting their divinity.

59
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:03,970
Maybe such a person is too naïve for all 
practical purposes.

60
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:12,330
He might have been cheated, might have been 
misled by some horrible people who try to

61
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:18,610
exploit his seeking, but still it remains.

62
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:29,500
This element suddenly gets ignited in Sahaja 
Yoga and for such a person this is the most

63
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:39,360
important thing: is to feel that Being which 
always kept him away from all the rest of

64
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:50,819
the ideologies and ‘great’ things and 
have always given him strength and confidence

65
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:51,819
and joy.

66
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:56,699
He sees that clearly in Sahaj Yog.

67
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:58,669
He adheres to it.

68
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:05,400
And when he nourishes it, he’s amazed that 
he has found himself.

69
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,719
Then it becomes his life.

70
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:23,669
There are thousands and thousands of people 
everywhere.

71
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:28,510
I say ‘thousands’, I don’t say ‘millions’.

72
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,580
I am sorry, because they are not in millions.

73
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,100
I am sorry for that.

74
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,110
I wish they were.

75
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:47,030
They could be counted in thousands only: maybe 
twenty-one thousand, altogether, of that quality.

76
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,610
There won’t be millions.

77
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,710
But they will be making millions later on.

78
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,530
They have to be a few!

79
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:04,860
These are people of special calibre as I said.

80
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:11,970
But it is necessary that everybody must be 
given Self-realisation, every seed must be

81
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,970
germinated.

82
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:20,980
But how many would sprout into the trees and 
would render fruit is a different point altogether.

83
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:28,070
First and foremost thing is that, first let 
them all be germinated.

84
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:33,920
In due course, all those would come back.

85
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:47,190
But some would prosper into their complete 
manifestation, in their full bloom in a very

86
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,920
short time, and that’s what matters the 
most.

87
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,220
The Divine is not interested in useless people, 
It is interested in that special calibre.

88
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:06,230
As I have told you: such a person may not 
be at all rich, may be absolutely poor.

89
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,980
That doesn’t mean that rich cannot be so!

90
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,560
[They] can be very rich also.

91
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,820
The outward appearances and status and all 
these denominations do not matter at all.

92
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,480
I am talking of the spark inside.

93
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:34,090
They can be called as gentlemen, in simple 
words, or if she is [female], a lady .

94
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:44,960
A serene dignity manifests through their being.

95
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,840
Sometimes it happens with their lives, also, 
that they find it very difficult to keep to

96
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:59,080
the norms of the mad world, and they may be 
a little cynical sometimes, could be.

97
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:07,370
But cynicism is not that subtlety, but they 
may appear to people a little cynical.

98
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:16,060
But they have to be very delightful and extremely 
cheerful people.

99
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:23,540
They cannot be morose, sad, emitting unhappiness 
all around, and big bores with a B capital

100
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,160
and O capital, R and E, all capital.

101
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,370
That cannot be possible.

102
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:34,120
They are extremely enjoyable and magnetic 
and dynamic.

103
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:45,010
They are complete in themselves because they 
feel their subtlety, they live on that.

104
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:55,020
Still their seeking is there, and the meaning 
they try to find to their own being.

105
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:00,720
And they want to identify their subtlety with 
something that is universal.

106
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:10,940
In their expression in any field that they 
are, they appeal to the Universal Being within

107
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,400
every one of us.

108
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:25,510
Maybe, they may not get a Nobel Prize, but 
[they have] a personality that emits that

109
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,510
kind of congenial behaviour.

110
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:37,640
Now if somebody is a person who is absolutely 
satanic, he will abhor such a person, possibly.

111
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:47,980
But this does not concern to the subtler being 
because he is at a level which is not tarnished

112
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:54,920
by gross attacks.

113
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:02,900
That is what one has to recognise in oneself 
and one should feel very proud and fortunate

114
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,260
that that exists within us.

115
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:11,790
No more one has to feel lonely, because now 
we are so many of us, of the same creed and

116
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,120
the same type.

117
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:22,070
And so many of us who have found out what 
is the reason, what expresses it, what manifests

118
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:38,610
it within us, what are the Deities that govern 
this subtlety within us: what you may call

119
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:47,120
the archetype images; archetype images are 
there which are real, not imaginary, within

120
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,180
us.

121
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:55,610
And all these discoveries, then make you feel 
confident of all these vague subtleties you

122
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:01,120
have been enjoying so far.

123
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:16,610
A long time back, I had given a simile like 
this: that a mother bird puts the little child,

124
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,970
or you can call, the baby bird, away from 
her.

125
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:34,390
And the baby bird feels the mother’s warmth, 
and she wants that.

126
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,910
And she is calling for the mother.

127
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:44,140
That calling itself is the last thing it knows 
of.

128
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,710
That’s the highest thing for the baby bird, 
nothing else matters.

129
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:53,980
You may give anything to the baby bird [but] 
it won’t be happy, it needs that.

130
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:59,410
It needs that warmth, that love.

131
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:07,000
And then it expresses itself by spreading 
its tiny little wings around and tries to

132
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,800
hop and to express it.

133
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:18,640
And then out of complete joy of its hopping, 
the mother bird herself comes down and engulfs

134
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:26,940
that child into the wings, giving all the 
warmth necessary.

135
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:39,990
It is that happening within us which takes 
place when the Kundalini rises.

136
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:52,570
The Kundalini is the part of that warmth within 
us, of that compassion.

137
00:15:52,570 --> 00:16:06,970
It’s a part of that beauty, it’s the part 
of that desire.

138
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,630
Desire…

139
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,850
What’s the matter?

140
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,060
The door is open or not.

141
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:19,010
Come in, come in!

142
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:40,630
They are waiting because they [don’t want 
to disturb].

143
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,630
What’s the matter?

144
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,630
Yogi: Sorry we’re late Shri Mataji.

145
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,630
Shri Mataji: No, it’s all right.

146
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,630
Come in!

147
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,760
So the desire of God is placed within us as 
Kundalini.

148
00:16:46,760 --> 00:17:02,990
And when all the external desires dim out 
within us and the real desire to be one with

149
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:13,000
the Almighty remains, the Kundalini can rise 
spontaneously.

150
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:21,110
That has happened to few people, very few 
people: you can say like Buddha, Mahavira.

151
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:34,320
These people were human beings and they achieved 
godliness: not by forcing yourself to get

152
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:47,750
rid of your desires, but through wisdom, understanding 
that, “This is stupidity, this is foolishness.

153
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,129
Where am I going?”

154
00:17:51,129 --> 00:17:54,379
Just the wisdom acting.

155
00:17:54,379 --> 00:18:05,139
Not a rational understanding, but the being 
itself rejecting.

156
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:11,309
Such stages are achieved through one’s own 
evolutionary forces.

157
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:28,750
Also, there are so many other happenings, 
or the other supports, which bring forth this

158
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,860
kind of spontaneous rising of the Kundalini.

159
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:40,520
There is somebody who wants to come and see 
me because he said, “Mother you are an authority

160
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:52,740
on Kundalini and there are many books written 
about Kundalini, and I have to write a criticism:

161
00:18:52,740 --> 00:19:01,360
that the Kundalini, when she rises, you start 
jumping and when she rises she gives you heat,

162
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:09,009
or you burn off yourself or you jump through 
the roof or something like that."

163
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:18,190
All sorts of horrifying things and nobody 
wants to listen to anything about Kundalini.

164
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,410
If you read those books, you’ll be really 
frightened.

165
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:27,039
I think it is absolutely satanic.

166
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:33,950
And he wants to know about the ‘authentic 
description’ of Kundalini.

167
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:48,899
And I told him that, “These books, all of 
them, should be thrown away into the sea!

168
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:57,490
Because they are written by people who have 
had no experience of Kundalini, of any kind."

169
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:07,790
Because they were people who must have been 
doing some sort of an ‘adventure’ somewhere.

170
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:16,929
Like some people believe that even finding 
of God is another job: if you have no job,

171
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:22,570
better find God, at least He might help you 
to survive!

172
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:35,820
Some people do believe that instead of sitting 
idle, why not try to find God, would be a

173
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,809
good idea.

174
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:48,070
And when such a thing happens and they venture 
into the search of God then, first, they are

175
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:56,029
hit by The Guard of Holiness.

176
00:20:56,029 --> 00:21:03,520
Because they are not entitled, they are not 
holy, they have no protocol about God Almighty,

177
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,730
they have no respect, they are just doing 
it because they are ego-oriented, they want

178
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:14,440
to have another ego-trip and they want to 
become ‘great explorers’ of Kundalini.

179
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:20,039
But you cannot do it.

180
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,600
You have to have proper protocol.

181
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:41,420
They lack all humility, all holiness, righteousness 
and all that is needed, to ask the help of

182
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,769
the Kundalini.

183
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:51,360
And they are hit by the first Deity, which 
sits in the triangular bone, which they can

184
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,710
also see sometimes — they have seen him, 
with a temper; in red colour, they call it

185
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,889
or maybe in orange colour.

186
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:13,279
Let him come, there’s somebody waiting there.

187
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:28,940
This Deity is a very powerful Deity, and it 
is the wisest Deity, because it is the Deity

188
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,840
which gives us wisdom.

189
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,460
You need not argue with the gentleman: It 
knows you out and out.

190
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:43,879
It knows every bit of you.

191
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:51,059
If you tell some story, It would say, “All 
right, I have heard all this story before,

192
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:56,429
now will you please keep to yourself!”

193
00:22:56,429 --> 00:23:07,320
It understands how genuine you are, how truthful 
you are.

194
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:15,370
And this Deity is the one which has given 
these bad experiences to these Kundalini seekers

195
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,590
and writers of Kundalini.

196
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:27,899
It’s a sad thing that a thief comes to the 
town and he’s caught up by the police, he’s

197
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:33,750
put in the jail, and when he goes back to 
the village, he tells them, “Oh God!

198
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,750
Terrible!

199
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,750
Never go to the city!

200
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,870
They catch hold of you, put you in the jail, 
don’t give you food to eat, and then you

201
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,210
cannot meet anyone for three years, and then 
they send you back!”

202
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,320
And [so] everybody is frightened of going 
to the city.

203
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,350
It is like that.

204
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:55,880
Or the thief who goes to the bank from the 
back door, or sometimes they dig a tunnel

205
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,840
or something like that: great people in this 
world, you know, they have time to do all

206
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:06,249
kinds of nonsensical things, to dig a tunnel 
to get some gold pieces, or something and

207
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:12,200
dig another tunnel to go to the jail directly.

208
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:28,529
So, these stupid people, when they try to 
do all these gross things, like going to a

209
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:36,149
bank through the back door and are caught 
up; if you go and ask them their experiences,

210
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:38,159
they say, “Oh horrible experience!

211
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,539
Never go near the bank!

212
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,639
You don’t put your money there, no, not 
at all!”

213
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:45,340
You ask them, “Why, what’s the matter?”

214
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,559
They say, “No they catch hold of you!

215
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:53,519
You know, terrible people in that bank!”

216
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:59,900
They could even go further with it to warn 
you.

217
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:08,470
If they are cunning, they may come by the 
front door and tell you, “Why go and put

218
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,749
money in the bank, you give it to me: I can 
look after it better.

219
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:14,890
It’s a better idea!

220
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:24,179
And if you want, I can you to twenty percent 
more than the bank does!”

221
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:31,659
And if you trust their cunning faces, you 
just hand over the money and you are lost

222
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:32,659
and the bank is lost to you.

223
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:33,659
And then you may say that, “What is this 
bank?”

224
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:45,059
In front of the bank there are people standing 
like this.

225
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,409
What are these religions after all?

226
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:55,289
What are these gurus in the name of God, standing 
in the front door, trying to rob others?

227
00:25:55,289 --> 00:26:00,470
What sort of a God is this?

228
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:07,600
So you start blaming the bank for the thieves 
who have cheated you.

229
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,450
You must learn to separate both.

230
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:20,480
This discretion is important even when you 
try to know about Kundalini, that Kundalini

231
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:32,710
is the desire of God to bestow upon you His 
kingdom.

232
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,600
The prince has to become the king.

233
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:49,360
And such a beautiful desire cannot be gross, 
cannot be ugly, cannot be painful, cannot

234
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:57,730
be troublesome, cannot be hideous and heinous.

235
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:04,840
Once you understand this, then you will respect 
your Kundalini.

236
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,789
She is your Mother because She is going to 
give you your second birth.

237
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:21,100
And She has been with you for ages, in so 
many lives, just waiting for this great time

238
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:29,749
when She is going to give you your Realisation.

239
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:43,309
I am telling you this because I know how beautiful 
She is.

240
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:54,779
So many have really tortured Her, have frozen 
Her, made Her into a stone by cursing Her

241
00:27:54,779 --> 00:28:06,110
but still She is breathing feebly, with the 
hope that a day may come when She may be able

242
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:13,990
to give you what She has been living for.

243
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,990
This is Kundalini.

244
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,720
This is Kundalini awakening.

245
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:26,389
We have to give up our gross understanding 
of Kundalini.

246
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:30,259
Like you would see in Sahaja Yoga when you 
will be coming, you have seen it all your

247
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:35,350
life — and you will see it more — that 
so many of them just come to me for getting

248
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,460
all right in health, only for that.

249
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,400
“I have got a back pain."

250
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,490
“I have got a stomach trouble."

251
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:48,230
“I have got arthritis,” or, “I have 
got diabetes."

252
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:56,190
There’s nothing that is not there, and “I 
am sure you will cure me!”

253
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:08,389
It’s quite a queer situation!

254
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:21,350
Because the request that I should cure is 
all right, but what is the right for this

255
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,840
request?

256
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:32,340
Why do you want that Divine should cure you?

257
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,880
For what?

258
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,130
For what purpose?

259
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:49,399
If Divine has to only cure people, it would 
open lots of hospitals and get some Nobel

260
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:52,019
Prize or something.

261
00:29:52,019 --> 00:30:04,980
But it is not the desire of Divine to go on 
curing people.

262
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,389
It would be stupid to just cure people who 
are good for nothing, useless, absolutely

263
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:11,850
useless, thoroughly wasted.

264
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,759
Why should it work [like this]?

265
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,220
It has intelligence.

266
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,850
It has wisdom.

267
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:28,110
Is it going to waste its energy on curing 
people who are good for nothing, useless?

268
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:36,999
Are you going to clean this lamp if you cannot 
put any light in it?

269
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:49,659
If you have no utility, in the Divine sense, 
why should Divine cure you?

270
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:55,700
So all those who believe, “Oh Mother, you 
must cure people,” and that you should cure

271
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:06,610
people, must know that all this is the work 
of Kundalini when She rises: She nourishes

272
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:23,929
you, She cleanses you, because in this being 
of yours, God Himself is going to manifest,

273
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:33,879
because this temple of your body is to be 
cleansed, because God has to enter into it.

274
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:44,539
That’s why the Divine respects and cleanses 
you and helps you.

275
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:51,609
Even it may help yours, means say a mother 
is there and her child is not all right, she’s

276
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:57,629
worried, so the Divine may cure the child, 
just to give peace to the mother who is going

277
00:31:57,629 --> 00:32:00,250
to manifest God’s powers.

278
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:09,850
Because God’s power is the integrated power 
of all the powers.

279
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:24,159
You can see here, on the left hand side: all 
the desires are manifested; the power of desire.

280
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:32,970
That means all the desires you have can be 
fulfilled and blessed by this power.

281
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:37,529
Can you believe it?

282
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:49,120
It has the power to fulfil all your desires, 
but after Realisation, not before that.

283
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,720
And after Realisation, your priorities change 
and your desires become different.

284
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:06,649
Then you do not ask for money or for children, 
or something like that but you start asking

285
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:11,669
for something of a very eternal nature.

286
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:14,109
The priorities change.

287
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:19,169
You start seeing your desire in a different 
aspect because light has come now.

288
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:25,019
For example, in the darkness when you are 
walking, you find that there’s a big black

289
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:29,970
bang in front of you, you can’t walk, so 
you desire, “Oh this bang should be removed!”

290
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:33,159
But when the light comes in you find there’s 
no bang, nothing!

291
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:35,049
It’s all open for you.

292
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:44,320
So your desire is that you should be able 
to see everything.

293
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
The whole priority changes.

294
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:52,999
So this Left Side has the power to fulfil 
all your desires.

295
00:33:52,999 --> 00:34:07,950
And the Right Side, where you see this yellow 
line, which looks so slender, has the power

296
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:20,030
to act, to fulfil all your desires and the 
desires of God.

297
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:33,160
Here I take you a little subtler: What are 
these acting powers?

298
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,430
Tremendous!

299
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:42,220
For example, this side is manifesting all 
the five elements.

300
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:47,610
All the five elements await your asking.

301
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:51,580
You see this fire?

302
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,810
You ask this fire, “Take away my problem!”

303
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,190
It takes away.

304
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,370
You have seen it.

305
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:07,050
Water element: you go to the sea, and just 
go and stand in the sea, after Realisation.

306
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:10,410
You find the whole thing is sucked in.

307
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,260
The Mother Earth sucks all your problems.

308
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,480
It’s so fantastic.

309
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,190
I was in Kuala Lumpur, you may write to him 
and find out.

310
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,270
He was the speaker of the assembly: [I was] 
at his residence, and there were at least

311
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,110
thousand people.

312
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,250
And sixty percent were sick, and forty were 
attending to them.

313
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,460
I was alone: no Sahaja Yogi, nothing.

314
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,600
Luckily, they had a big garden and it was 
quite warm day.

315
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,910
I said, “All right, let’s go in the garden!”

316
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:41,760
I made them sit in the garden and I asked 
the Mother Earth: I said, “You better now

317
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,760
do the job!

318
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,990
And I am sitting down."

319
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:51,310
And everybody started feeling better.

320
00:35:51,310 --> 00:36:03,850
One thing I had never before seen being cured 
was this polio.

321
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:07,780
And a little boy, about eight years of age 
was sitting on the ground: his parents had

322
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,050
brought him on their back and put him down 
there.

323
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,600
He just got up and started walking!

324
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:22,170
And the parents suddenly realised he’s missing: 
“Where is he gone?”

325
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,030
And he was running in the garden!

326
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,030
It’s a fact!

327
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,340
Some blind started seeing things.

328
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,340
It’s most remarkable.

329
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:33,540
You may write to him, I will give you his 
address.

330
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,020
It’s a fact, it happened.

331
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,020
And for everyone the whole miracle was so 
simple that they took it for granted; they

332
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,100
didn’t find that there was anything so fantastic: 
“After all Mother is here, so it has to

333
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,330
work out!”

334
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,381
They did not rationalise it or anything — took 
it for granted.

335
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:58,100
And even today, if I go there, this may happen.

336
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:09,230
All the elements are waiting for your orders.

337
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:19,560
So the great angels on the left hand side 
communicate to the right hand side angels:

338
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,610
all the angels of the world.

339
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:27,020
Though it may sound fantastic to many, but 
they exist, and you have to just ask their

340
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,020
help.

341
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:36,610
That is what is a mantra: is the awakened 
calling, or you can say, calling which has

342
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:37,610
meaning.

343
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:44,860
For example: a policeman blows his whistle, 
it has a meaning, but anybody else starts

344
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:52,570
whistling, people will put him in the jail.

345
00:37:52,570 --> 00:38:02,990
In the same way, the mantra is the authority 
which is applied with the word.

346
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:09,590
And with this you can awaken all these forces 
within you.

347
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:15,560
They are so tremendous that I’ll take at 
least seven lectures to describe [and] which

348
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:23,000
I will describe some time; of which you are 
aware already, most of you: how they work

349
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,830
and how they help you.

350
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:36,830
Even we take them for granted, Sahaja Yogis, 
because if you notice in life, has one great

351
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:46,380
mystery, I don’t know if you are aware of 
that mystery: that whatever fantastic we get,

352
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:54,800
somehow or other, we get it in such a way 
that we take it for granted.

353
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,610
It’s very sweet, isn’t it?

354
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:04,920
Supposing every time we get a shock or we 
get frightened, and we say, “Oh God!”

355
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,790
We would become neurotic, or funny people.

356
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:16,890
But the way it settles down within us like 
a leaf falling from the tree and drying out

357
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:22,590
and just touches the ground softly, and the 
ground also takes it for granted.

358
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:26,230
In the same way, all this we take for granted.

359
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:30,910
For example, our eyes, our nose, our forehead, 
everything we take for granted, our human

360
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,690
bearing, everything we take it for granted, 
in the same way take even Sahaj Yog for granted:

361
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:41,490
and that’s the best way.

362
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:48,830
But do we take it for granted, the way we 
take our being for granted?

363
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,000
Is the question.

364
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,660
For example, we take it for granted our hand: 
so if I have to lift my purse, I lift my hand,

365
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,660
like this.

366
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:05,920
When we take Sahaja Yoga for granted, do we 
use our vibrations for everything?

367
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,420
Because now in our vibratory awareness, if 
we have taken it for granted, we should completely

368
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,620
stand in it and work it out.

369
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,810
I mean, I do that way.

370
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,980
To me everything is nothing but vibrations.

371
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,670
Everything I do is nothing but vibrations.

372
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:29,910
All my movements and everything is nothing 
but vibrations.

373
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:34,660
I take for granted Myself very well.

374
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:40,930
I wish you could take for granted all that 
is within you, the way we take [other things]

375
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,930
for granted.

376
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:47,900
Say, I give you a television and you just 
take it and you put it to the mains and you

377
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,030
see the thing.

378
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:56,840
You do not jump and say, “Oh God, look at 
the miracle!

379
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Imagine!”

380
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,060
Nothing, you just take it for granted.

381
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:07,140
Anything: computer or any marvellous thing 
that you see — you take it for granted.

382
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:18,320
In the same way, maybe in the beginning one 
feels, “How is it possible?”

383
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,600
One may start thinking like that for a while.

384
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:29,000
Too much thinking is also not good, because 
then you are not take it for granted.

385
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,740
But afterwards, you must use it left and right!

386
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,400
Just try!

387
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,540
You are empowered.

388
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,060
Now your television is open.

389
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,640
It has started working.

390
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:53,620
You are a great instrument and created [over] 
thousands of years with such care.

391
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:59,830
You do not know what forces have been used: 
how delicately and how dynamically.

392
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:10,920
You have no idea as to how all the stars and 
all the heavens are moved up and down to create

393
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,040
this beautiful being that is the human personality.

394
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:22,260
You have no idea of that.

395
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,420
And now, when Sahaj Yoga takes place, also 
you must know that Sahaj Yoga’s working

396
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:32,200
has been worked out in the very dynamic manner.

397
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,760
There are tremendous subtle forces which are 
working it out.

398
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:43,320
You cannot make your Kundalini pulsate without 
something special happening there.

399
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:49,030
Just think of a remote control that works 
out your Kundalini!

400
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:53,950
Just think of it!

401
00:42:53,950 --> 00:43:02,810
There must be a tremendous mechanism!

402
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:09,540
Why I say, take it for granted [is] because 
if you try first to open all your remote controls

403
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:20,690
and see for yourself and then breaking all 
of them, you start starting your television,

404
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:24,790
you will find the whole thing is finished 
and you have a headache, and you don’t want

405
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,040
to see anything.

406
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:32,500
That’s what happens to Sahaj Yogis, specially 
in the West, because as soon as they get their

407
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:38,140
Realisation they go home and make a nice dissection 
by thinking about it.

408
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,380
They didn’t get Realisation by thinking!

409
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,550
It’s a simple thing!

410
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,930
And then they go back.

411
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:49,830
And then after seven months they come back 
and say, “Mother I have been to you seven

412
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:58,660
months back, now I think I was wrong."

413
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:09,600
So I say: why lose those seven months?

414
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:16,340
Today I hope you all will feel our subtleties 
flowering.

415
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:25,010
Let us take ourselves down to those subtle 
points which we respected and the Kundalini

416
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,620
will nourish it — the attention.

417
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:35,830
Wherever your attention goes now, this attention 
is enlightened attention.

418
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:40,520
Today I received a letter from Australia, 
somebody has written, “Mother, we had sent

419
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:49,920
you a picture of someone, husband and wife, 
and they are better since you gave them bandhan."

420
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,990
And they were very serious patients.

421
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,070
And they are really better.

422
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,540
But I did nothing!

423
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,620
Really I don’t do anything.

424
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,350
I just looked at the photograph, that’s 
all.

425
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:09,280
I didn’t even give bandhan, you know, to 
be very frank.

426
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,280
I just looked at it, that’s all.

427
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,070
I didn’t think, I just looked at it, and 
it worked.

428
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,950
Really I don’t do anything!

429
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:18,141
You people thank me for nothing at all, you 
know.

430
00:45:18,141 --> 00:45:21,250
When you don’t do anything and people thank 
you, you don’t know what to say so you go

431
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:25,050
on saying, “All right, thank you for thanking!” 
(laughing)

432
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:33,240
So again, thank you for being here.

433
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,570
And we’ll have some meditation.

434
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:42,400
I hope we’ll touch some deeper stratas within 
yourselves.

435
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,730
May God bless you all!

436
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:51,520
You have come for the first time both of you?

437
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,210
You have been once before?

438
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,570
What about you?

439
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:57,630
Lady: It’s my first time.

440
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,080
Shri Mataji: First time?

441
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,080
Good.

442
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,080
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

443
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,080
Seeker: Yes.

444
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,080
Shri Mataji: All right, so you haven’t lost 
it!

445
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,170
And what about you, are you feeling the cool 
breeze in the hand?

446
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:07,170
Seeker: No

447
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,310
Shri Mataji: Not yet?

448
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,371
All right, it will work out, it will work 
out.

449
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:11,371
What about you?

450
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:14,680
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

451
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,990
No?

452
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:18,170
How are you?

453
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:20,053
Yogi: Feeling the cool breeze Mother.

454
00:46:20,053 --> 00:46:21,053
Shri Mataji: Well good!

455
00:46:21,053 --> 00:46:22,053
Good!

456
00:46:22,053 --> 00:46:23,053
Good!

457
00:46:23,053 --> 00:46:24,053
Are you all right?

458
00:46:24,053 --> 00:46:25,620
Good.What about you?

459
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,190
Lady: I don’t feel today.

460
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,341
Shri Mataji: You are thinking!

461
00:46:28,341 --> 00:46:29,341
Now, please!

462
00:46:29,341 --> 00:46:30,341
Please!

463
00:46:30,341 --> 00:46:33,960
You see, thinking stops it.

464
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,260
How?

465
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:41,830
Between the two thoughts — for example, 
a thought rises and falls off, and another

466
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:49,590
thought rises and falls off — between these 
two thoughts there is a little gap, that gap

467
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:50,590
has expanded.

468
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:56,340
For example, the thought that was, is the 
past and that is going to come is the future.

469
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:00,920
In between is the space called as vilamba.

470
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,320
And when you start thinking about it you jump 
onto the cusp of these thoughts.

471
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,480
You are beyond thought.

472
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:18,900
An Indian will understand it faster, because 
it’s called as Nirvichar Samadhi: is the

473
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,920
state where you become thoughtlessly aware.

474
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,950
They know that that’s what it is.

475
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:26,850
You cannot think about it, because rationality 
is a limited thing.

476
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:32,280
So you have to jump into the space.

477
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:37,470
When you are in the space then you are not 
in the capsule.

478
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:41,690
But if you are in the capsule you are not 
in the space.

479
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:44,650
Better now?

480
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:47,600
Lady: Yes.

481
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:56,680
Shri Mataji: See how it works.

482
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,400
Even your problems, I mean, I have given big 
lectures on this, how to solve your problems,

483
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,900
in your thoughtless awareness.

484
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:11,500
That’s the mouth, that’s the mouth where 
you have to put the problem in, and it works

485
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,870
in your thoughtless awareness.

486
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:20,020
It’s the most precious thing, is to keep 
it up.

487
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:26,590
Are you getting now cool breeze?

488
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:27,690
Correct.

489
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,900
What about you, not yet?

490
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:30,900
Now watch me here.

491
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,460
Are you thinking still?

492
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,830
All right, you watch me without thinking.

493
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,930
That’s another way you can do it.

494
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:41,790
My face is such a funny thing that if you 
watch it for a long time, you will have no

495
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:42,790
thoughts!

496
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,070
Just it is something very funny you know!

497
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:50,550
Today it happened: I went to the tailor and 
he just looked at me and he didn’t know

498
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,650
what he was trying to do.

499
00:48:52,650 --> 00:49:00,360
And my husband said, “Is he stunned or what 
happened?”

500
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,360
(laughter)

501
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,580
Now watch me without thinking!

502
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,830
Better!

503
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:09,070
See!

504
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:14,440
This is the face!

505
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,630
This is needed.

506
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:18,860
What am I to do?

507
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:24,180
I mean, this is the problem with me.

508
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:28,430
I don’t know how to explain myself!

509
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:29,510
Aap ka aa rahe thanda?

510
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:30,510
Thik hai.

511
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:31,950
(Hindi: Are you getting cool?

512
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:32,950
Good!)

513
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:33,950
How are you now?

514
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:34,950
Better?

515
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:35,950
Everyday you will be better and better and 
better.

516
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:36,950
How are you?

517
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:37,950
Lady: A bit better.

518
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:38,950
Not so good as yesterday.

519
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:47,740
I felt a lot of cool breeze yesterday but 
not so much today.

520
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:51,750
Shri Mataji: So, that means you are going 
down a little.

521
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:52,750
All right?

522
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:56,080
So now keep it up.

523
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:04,960
You see, it is like a washing machine, I can 
say.

524
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,480
It goes round and round, a little bit, for 
cleansing.

525
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,480
All right?

526
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,480
They call it Mahamaya.

527
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,380
They call it “The Great Illusion”.

528
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,640
Mother is a great illusion, because She puts 
us into illusion.

529
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,640
I do not!

530
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,100
We tell God, “Lead us not into temptation."

531
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,470
Now why will He take you to temptation?

532
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:25,590
But you do go.

533
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:29,350
So you tell God that, “You keep us away 
from that!”

534
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:32,580
That’s all you tell God: that, “You keep 
us away from thinking!”

535
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:44,590
And it works.

536
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:50,540
Better?

537
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,620
Your face looks different immediately.

538
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,640
Keep it up!

539
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,660
Now all right.

540
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:02,690
Good, once it clicks!

541
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,370
But you must come every Monday.

542
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:05,520
See how people have gone up!

543
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,500
How many people they are giving Realisation?

544
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,180
All right?

545
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:16,740
You must come, this is the most pleasurable 
thing!

546
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,740
You don’t know.

547
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:20,460
It is little bit you have to develop the taste.

548
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,470
Because you are used to the gross stuff, you 
see.

549
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:27,570
Like somebody who is used to wines cannot 
give up.

550
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:34,670
But once the wine from within starts pouring 
in, you just don’t want it!

551
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:36,830
Better.

552
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:44,490
Somebody has come I believe.

553
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,360
Hmmm!

554
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:51,960
He’s better now.

555
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,700
All right?

556
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:01,310
What’s happened Gavin?

557
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:03,960
I see that so clear!

558
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,960
Why?

559
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,960
You’ve been having a holiday or what?

560
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,590
It’s horrible, absolutely!

561
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:11,220
Very badly caught up!

562
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,050
What’s the matter?

563
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,590
You had a bad cold?

564
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:18,970
Come here!

565
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:24,930
I have never seen you being caught that much.

566
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:41,720
You had exposed yourself I think [it was] 
the sunning or what happened?

567
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:48,920
Terrible!

568
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:56,130
Better?

569
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:57,130
Be careful!

570
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:02,760
You see, these days it’s very sunny, looks 
sunny, but maybe…You have to look after

571
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,760
yourself.

572
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,450
This country is full of this problem.

573
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:10,190
Now better.

574
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,940
What’s it?

575
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,810
Vishuddhi.

576
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:27,050
It rises from Vishuddhi to this.

577
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:28,920
Haa!

578
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,670
Better now.

579
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:58,060
You sit or a while and it will work out in 
the…You see it rises from the Vishuddhi

580
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,060
to the.

581
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:04,610
I think you caught cold very badly.

582
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,790
What happened?

583
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:12,260
Gavin Brown: I don’t know.

584
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:22,110
Shri Mataji: I think you put your hand here.

585
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:24,300
Sit down!

586
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,300
Be careful.

587
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,300
Hmm!

588
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,300
Better.

589
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,590
Somebody with cold must have come or something 
you see, or the hay fever is there.

590
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:32,390
Gavin Brown: Might be that.

591
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:37,430
Shri Mataji: From Right Nabhi: it’s on the 
right hand side the problem is.

592
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:41,300
How are you?

593
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,650
Good!

594
00:54:44,650 --> 00:55:04,800
Now close your eyes, close.

595
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:15,580
You put your hand here, the right, and the 
left there to work out the Vishuddhi.

596
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:19,010
Right Nabhi also.

597
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:23,560
Is it your liver coming up or what?

598
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:31,060
Gavin Brown: I don’t think so.

599
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:38,560
Shri Mataji: Quite a lot eh?

600
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,310
Gavin Brown: Hmm.

601
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:52,310
Shri Mataji: All right, move from the left 
more, from the left.

602
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:57,620
Keep your eyes shut and enjoy your Self, enjoy 
your Self.

603
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,270
Just don’t think.

604
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:01,380
Just don’t think.

605
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:08,830
Just enjoy your Self.

606
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:13,720
Don’t think.

607
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,600
Don’t think.

608
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,040
Hmm!

609
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,480
Better.

610
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:33,250
Where is it Mark?

611
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:38,140
Whole Left?

612
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:43,020
Better now?

613
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,460
Improving?

614
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,910
Heart?

615
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:50,350
Better.

616
00:56:50,350 --> 00:57:00,120
Keep your eyes shut!

617
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:07,440
Enjoy your Self.

618
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:14,080
You are all going down into your Self.

619
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,430
Just allow it.

620
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,310
Relax, relax.

621
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:19,190
Just relax.

622
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:29,480
Don’t think about anything just relax.

623
00:57:29,480 --> 00:58:11,200
You are working it out.

624
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:36,230
Now just relax.

625
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:52,920
Don’t think.

626
00:58:52,920 --> 00:59:09,600
Better now.

627
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:17,950
Tremendous!

628
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:26,290
Haa?

629
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:42,980
Giving out.

630
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:51,320
Better.

631
00:59:51,320 --> 01:00:16,350
Now, better now?

632
01:00:16,350 --> 01:01:28,410
Now are

633
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:29,800
you feeling?

634
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,970
Better?

635
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:33,300
Losing again?

636
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,710
You are losing again?

637
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,650
What?

638
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:42,550
Come up, come here.

639
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:44,310
Sit down.

640
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:46,080
Sit down.

641
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:58,450
See your liver comes back again: still treating 
your liver patients there is it?

642
01:01:58,450 --> 01:01:59,710
Come forward, come forward.

643
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:01,890
I’ll have to put my foot on your liver.

644
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:03,830
Now just see how stone-like it has become.

645
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:10,460
See now, what else do you expect but heat?

646
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:15,040
See?

647
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:33,370
That’s what it is.

648
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:42,540
Now better?

649
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:56,600
Somebody’s catching on the Back Agnya.

650
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,600
Hmm!

651
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,600
Gavin Brown: It’s moving.

652
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,600
It’s moving now.

653
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,600
Shri Mataji: Better?

654
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,600
Much better now.

655
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,600
Sorry I have to use my feet but they are very 
powerful you know.

656
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,660
For physical problems they are better than 
my hands are.

657
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:17,180
Poor things, they go on working morning till 
evening!

658
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:31,220
Press it hard!

659
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:35,900
Better!

660
01:03:35,900 --> 01:04:02,830
Still you are working with the liver patients 
are they?

661
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:04,480
Doctor: Hmm.

662
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,960
Shri Mataji: What do you do about them?

663
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:11,660
What treatments do you give for liver patients 
in the hospitals?

664
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,110
Doctor: Special drugs.

665
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:15,030
Shri Mataji: What drugs?

666
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:17,940
Doctor: Depends what the problem is with the 
liver.

667
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,923
Shri Mataji: But still what drugs normally 
you use?

668
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:30,310
Doctor: The main things they use are for someone 
who is alcoholic and they start to bleed.

669
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:31,310
Shri Mataji: Alcohol?

670
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:33,620
Doctor: They have alcoholic cirrhosis and 
they bleed and they vomit blood.

671
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:34,620
Shri Mataji: Really?

672
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,620
That serious?

673
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:46,670
Doctor: So we have special drugs to help stop 
that.

674
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:56,460
Shri Mataji: Just look at this!

675
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,430
Despite that, nobody publishes these things.

676
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:05,460
You know, the other day in a very so-called 
important dinner table, there was a big argument

677
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:13,500
[that] was on that, in France, the pubs are 
open all the time, while here they open very

678
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:18,770
late, so people are very unhappy that you 
are not sufficiently alcoholic!

679
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:21,590
A big discussion is on.

680
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:23,170
Let them see these photographs!

681
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:30,050
Why not show them how people vomit blood and 
how people do these things.

682
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:35,730
It would be a good idea.

683
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:36,730
And the food they eat do they?

684
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:42,710
Doctor: Well, there’s so many different 
problems we have with the liver.

685
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:48,657
Say, they are alcoholic then they have intravenous 
therapy.

686
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:49,657
Shri Mataji: They cannot eat the food?

687
01:05:49,657 --> 01:05:50,657
They vomit?

688
01:05:50,657 --> 01:05:51,657
Doctor: So they put special tubes down them 
to stop them vomiting, and then they give

689
01:05:51,657 --> 01:05:51,950
them blood because they are losing so much.
