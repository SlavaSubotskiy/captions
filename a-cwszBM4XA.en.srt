1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:05,890
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

2
00:00:08,129 --> 00:00:11,010
Definitely it is evident today

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,929
that you have come here all the way in the rain

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,970
to seek the truth, that you are real seekers.

5
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,529
And the real seekers

6
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,930
will find the real way.

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,828
Whatever they may do, whatever wrong path they may take,

8
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:42,014
they may identify themselves with wrong things also,

9
00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:44,942
and may oppose in the beginning the truth,

10
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:50,530
but ultimately they will all find the real path,

11
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,865
as long as they do not try to deceive themselves.

12
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,288
The awakening of the Kundalini

13
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,969
is not a new thing as you people may be thinking.

14
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,569
It has been done since

15
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,481
sixteenth century back,

16
00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:24,219
when it is said Indra, the God King,

17
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:26,849
was given Realization.

18
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,824
So you can imagine,

19
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:32,243
that is called as Siddhendra,

20
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:37,970
means the Indra first made a hole here.

21
00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:42,529
And there’s a place where it was done in India.

22
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,376
It’s a very ancient thing,

23
00:01:44,544 --> 00:01:46,849
and at the time of Rama also,

24
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,126
there was a fellow called Nachiketa

25
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:53,878
who came to Rama’s father-in-law, Janaka,

26
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,720
and asked Him if he could get his Self Realization.

27
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,049
And the father-in-law said that

28
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,649
“You can ask anything but not for your Realization.”

29
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,119
He said, “No, I don’t want anything else but Realization”.

30
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,626
And they say that He put him to test, many a times, for years,

31
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:17,929
and then he was the first who got Realization,

32
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:20,905
at the time of Shri Rama.

33
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:27,744
It is very interesting that how this system of Self Realization,

34
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:32,058
was kept more or less exclusive, and rather secretive,

35
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:36,140
because the people would like always

36
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:40,440
to use this method to make some money out of it;

37
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:44,211
that they would not respect the reality,

38
00:02:44,412 --> 00:02:49,429
and would learn, say about your chakras, Kundalini,

39
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,050
this, that, few words and start selling books

40
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,450
or posing that they are born again,

41
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:58,768
and impressing others with it,

42
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,928
and try to make some cults or some sort of groups,

43
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:07,489
just forming into some falsehood.

44
00:03:07,918 --> 00:03:11,329
And that is the reason this was kept quite a secret.

45
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,929
But on the right hand side of the seeking,

46
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,929
they tried to find out the ways and methods

47
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:24,689
how to initiate the elements within us, the casual of elements,

48
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,649
first to initiate the causal of the elements,

49
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,089
by which we could control the elements for our own purpose.

50
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,449
This was one way where they called it as the Yagnya and all that.

51
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,666
And that’s how the Vedas were written.

52
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:42,129
Veda means vida, means to know.

53
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,783
These were written to say that you have to know.

54
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:49,010
And at the very beginning of the Vedas, it is written

55
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,152
that after reading this book, throughout,

56
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:55,784
if you have not known the truth,

57
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:58,809
it is of no use to you.

58
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,569
The very first stanza says so.

59
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,440
So the whole thing was done with that idea,

60
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:08,757
and in the ancient country of India,

61
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,093
they started working on the right side

62
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:14,818
to know this subtle body

63
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:18,314
or the subtle Deities of all the elements

64
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:21,890
so that they could master the elements; this was first idea.

65
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:26,843
On the left hand side, they started another kind of a search,

66
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:29,930
in believing that there is God,

67
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,570
and we have to ask the help of God.

68
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,903
And they started praying,

69
00:04:36,102 --> 00:04:38,169
first to Primordial Mother,

70
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,529
because in every religion there is a place for the Mother.

71
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,649
There’s no religion which does not believe in the Primordial Mother.

72
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,570
You can say that at the time of Mohammed Sahib,

73
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,289
He didn’t talk much about it, because the time was such.

74
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,359
But His own daughter

75
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,597
was an incarnation of the Primordial Mother,

76
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:01,569
whose name was Fatima Bi.

77
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:06,061
And the two sons that were born to Her, are the sons

78
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:12,296
who came on this earth also as Mahavira and Buddha.

79
00:05:12,497 --> 00:05:14,523
And they were born even earlier.

80
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:17,175
Like that, they were born again and again,

81
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:21,530
as these two elements, as the disciples, as two disciples.

82
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,191
And you can see if you read their life,

83
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,689
their character, their behavior, you’ll be surprised,

84
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,329
how these two characters have been born again and again,

85
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,770
in different times, to suggest two personalities

86
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,049
of two types, who have been seeking God,

87
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,692
and who have been trying to understand God

88
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:46,251
through their personality as disciples;

89
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:49,729
and how they reached a conclusion

90
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,690
after taking a kind of a position in life.

91
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,490
Now for example Buddha preached that

92
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,289
there should be complete non-violence,

93
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,756
and also Mahavira said so, there should be non-violence.

94
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:07,290
But they carried it to such an extent.

95
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:11,061
that Mahavira’s disciples started saving the bugs.

96
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:14,373
They would get some bugs from the village,

97
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:16,397
put them in a hut

98
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:20,609
and put a Brahmin inside that – fanaticism at that stage -

99
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,710
and the bugs would eat,

100
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:29,129
or take, take out the blood of that poor brahmin,

101
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,449
and when they would be all filled with blood,

102
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,489
then they would give money to this brahmin.

103
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:41,209
Such extreme vegetarianism or extreme type of ahinsa!

104
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,128
Or another type of Buddha’s ahinsa that started

105
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,929
that Buddha was not the one who was a vegetarian,

106
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,650
because He died, at the end you know that,

107
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,849
He ate the meat of a boar which was not properly cooked.

108
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:58,072
So this kind of extreme type of

109
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:02,128
food-oriented religion started out of them,

110
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,748
so they got themselves born again,

111
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,362
as Hassan and Hussein and [unclear]

112
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,192
[missing a part] a person who is a religious person.

113
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:18,008
So the idea of all these people was in such a way

114
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:23,158
that the time at that period was such and such,

115
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:27,460
and at that period this was the proper thing to be done.

116
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:30,541
Now we can see the example of Christ is.

117
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,413
Christ came at a time

118
00:07:32,614 --> 00:07:36,260
where the Son of God had to manifest.

119
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:40,941
And He came at a time where He had to forgive,

120
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:47,061
and He had to show to people how stupid they were, to crucify Him,

121
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:52,061
so that they could repent for what stupidity they have done.

122
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:54,421
And that’s how He came on this earth.

123
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:57,271
But when He will come again,

124
00:07:57,528 --> 00:08:00,300
He’s not going to come in that way.

125
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:03,075
The Second Advent of Christ,

126
00:08:03,204 --> 00:08:06,460
is going to be a very serious one.

127
00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:10,741
When He will come, He will have eleven destroying powers.

128
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:14,100
With that He will destroy all that is useless,

129
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:17,661
all that has gone wasted, all those fanatics

130
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:20,357
or "Whom they'll call Christ, Christ, I won’t know”,

131
00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:22,021
He’s told that, very well.

132
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:25,461
All these things He’s going to absolutely finish off.

133
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:29,381
And those who are realized souls,

134
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:32,900
who have entered into the Kingdom of God, will be only saved.

135
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,661
And this is what is described in all the Scriptures.

136
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:41,048
Of course somebody calls them, say Islam calls it “Mahdi”

137
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:43,741
in India He is called as “Kalki”,

138
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:47,421
in the Bible He is called as “the Christ on the white horse”.

139
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:49,221
He is called by various names,

140
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,941
but it is definite that He is going to come,

141
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:53,586
and when He comes,

142
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:58,515
then He is not going to bother as to tell you, and convince you,

143
00:08:58,716 --> 00:09:03,735
and to counsel you or to redeem you and give you Realization.

144
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:07,100
That time, He is not going to bother about it.

145
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:10,061
He is going to come in pure destructive form,

146
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:12,872
where He will destroy all that is useless.

147
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:17,584
And to understand this, if you see
the Sistine Chapel of Michelangelo,

148
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:20,741
you can see Him clearly standing, at the Agnya chakra,

149
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:23,700
with a robust body, throwing people up and down.

150
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:26,421
Those who call, “Christ, Christ”, He throws them down,

151
00:09:26,781 --> 00:09:31,388
because they did not do anything what Christ has asked for.

152
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,999
Now the people should know

153
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,261
what we have got out of anything whatsoever.

154
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:40,981
You may be identified with any cult, with any idea,

155
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,941
with any group, or anything,

156
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:46,459
but always must know what you have you got out of it.

157
00:09:46,661 --> 00:09:50,820
For example, I would say for Christians it is necessary to know

158
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,821
that Christ has said a very strong thing,

159
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:57,581
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

160
00:09:58,221 --> 00:10:01,421
Let us find out, do we have innocent eyes?

161
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:04,739
If we don’t, we are not Christians.

162
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:06,941
How do we have innocent eyes?

163
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:10,099
How do we develop our innocence, is the problem.

164
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:14,380
And to develop our innocence we have to awaken the Kundalini.

165
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,566
When the Kundalini is awakened, the first center

166
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:19,900
of innocence is awakened.

167
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,420
At that time all the excretion work of the body just stops,

168
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:32,115
and this center of Mooladhara, informs the Kundalini,

169
00:10:32,316 --> 00:10:36,381
that “There is somebody who knows the job and You can rise.”

170
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:38,661
Then only the Kundalini rises.

171
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:42,882
This center of innocence is first awakened within us.

172
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:48,420
If this center finds that the person is anti-God,

173
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:50,741
he is anti-Christ,

174
00:10:51,341 --> 00:10:55,221
he is a man who is a devil, or any sort of a thing,

175
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:57,981
it just does not allow the Kundalini to rise.

176
00:10:58,181 --> 00:11:01,221
I have seen people with absolute frozen Kundalini;

177
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:04,861
I have seen people who have nothing to do with Kundalini,

178
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,026
we can say they are just like devils

179
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:11,060
and they have no way that they can be realized.

180
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:14,646
But ninety-nine percent people in this world

181
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:18,301
are excellent people, good people,

182
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:20,781
and out of them I think at least

183
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:23,820
thirty to forty percent people are seeking God.

184
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:28,421
Not all; some are seeking money, some are seeking power

185
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:31,781
and some are seeking some personal indulgences.

186
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:35,701
But there are definitely true seekers on this earth,

187
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:39,828
and this thirty percent people are, or forty percent people,

188
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:43,420
are the most important people from the God’s point of view.

189
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:47,221
You might be anything. You might be having any organization,

190
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:49,900
you might be having any position in life,

191
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,661
you might be any great personality, makes no difference to God.

192
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:57,100
What is important is that are you seeking?

193
00:11:57,621 --> 00:12:00,981
If you’re not, the door will be opened has been promised.

194
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:03,501
But if you think you have already achieved it

195
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:06,540
and that you are there, how can it be worked out?

196
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:11,061
So one has to be humble about it, and allow the Kundalini to rise

197
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:14,949
in Its own glory, giving you your real beauty.

198
00:12:15,261 --> 00:12:19,820
Now the thing we have to know that

199
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:25,100
as the Kundalini ascends, we also start getting powers.

200
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:28,900
The first power is that of innocence.

201
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,208
Innocence has a power above all other powers.

202
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:36,420
It’s the most powerful thing,

203
00:12:36,621 --> 00:12:39,203
but in the human beings it takes time

204
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:42,656
for innocence to be awakened in the full way.

205
00:12:42,857 --> 00:12:46,180
It takes time. As a child they have the innocence;

206
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:49,341
and in childhood, if they get their awakening

207
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:51,900
that’s the best thing that can happen to human beings

208
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,421
that in the childhood only they become, get their Realization.

209
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:57,540
But as soon as you start growing

210
00:12:57,781 --> 00:13:01,660
your attention starts going either to the left or to the right.

211
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:04,621
You start indulging into all kinds of things

212
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:06,701
as far as your sex is concerned,

213
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:09,509
as far as your seeking is concerned,

214
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,560
and you then jump on to some sort of a wrong thing

215
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:15,423
which you should not have done.

216
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:18,273
And that’s how the first center gets lost.

217
00:13:18,474 --> 00:13:22,541
An innocent person is looked after by angels.

218
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:25,723
Such a person has no fear of anything.

219
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:30,031
He’s not bothered, he’s never violent, he’s never hasty,

220
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:33,180
he’s never in a temper, he’s so peaceful,

221
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:37,621
and he knows that what he is doing is the right thing.

222
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,099
Such a person stands by righteousness.

223
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:45,420
Like you can see in the life of Christ is a very good example

224
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:50,026
that when Mary Magdalene was stoned by people, He stood up,

225
00:13:50,228 --> 00:13:53,260
and He said, “Among you who has done no sin

226
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:55,100
can throw the stone at her.”

227
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,261
Actually Christ had nothing to do with a prostitute.

228
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:02,021
He had no relationship of any kind with her.

229
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:06,100
She is a prostitute and He is the Son of God.

230
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:10,100
But at that time He did feel that she has a right to exist,

231
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:13,181
because those who are stoning her

232
00:14:13,382 --> 00:14:15,861
are the people who have committed also sins.

233
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,900
Only she is a person who’s exposed, and He stood by her.

234
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,673
And that is what happens to a person who is innocent

235
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:24,059
he is fearless.

236
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,981
He has no fear of anything,

237
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:30,501
because he knows that he stands on truth and on innocence.

238
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:36,701
Such a person also has a capacity to bear up lots of nonsense,

239
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:41,621
to laugh at lots of tortures and troubles people bestow upon him.

240
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:44,274
And the greatest thing of innocence is,

241
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,380
that it gives you discretion.

242
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:50,075
Such a person is immensely discreet. He’s so wise.

243
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:53,460
He may be a little child, he may be a grown-up person,

244
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:56,580
he may be a villager, he might be educated,

245
00:14:56,782 --> 00:14:59,860
he might be uneducated, but he’s so wise

246
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:04,107
that he sees what is right and what is righteous.

247
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:07,900
And this is the greatest quality of an innocent person,

248
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,781
that he’s very discreet about everything.

249
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:15,341
His discretion is just like a straight forward hit.

250
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,620
He doesn’t have to think, he doesn’t have to bother.

251
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:22,100
Whatever he decides is absolute discreet,

252
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:24,180
and he doesn’t have to have choices.

253
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,611
He doesn’t go on choosing people, he doesn’t go on choosing things.

254
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:29,740
He said, “This is the thing” – finished.

255
00:15:29,941 --> 00:15:32,900
So, such a person becomes absolutely dynamic

256
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,900
because he doesn’t waste any energy, he doesn’t waste his brains,

257
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,981
he doesn’t waste his arguments with anyone.

258
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:42,741
If he thinks a person is worth arguing, he’ll argue,

259
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:46,500
otherwise he’ll say, “All right, you are clever. Go ahead.”

260
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:51,010
This is the understanding of a person,

261
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:52,981
who is completely discreet.

262
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:56,701
Like there was a very big joke about it, that

263
00:15:57,621 --> 00:16:01,261
there was a man who was going up the road,

264
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:06,260
up the stairs, and another one was coming downstairs.

265
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:10,501
The one who was going up the road was a wise man

266
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:13,300
and the one who was coming down was not a wise man.

267
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:16,620
So he tried to be aggressive, so, and he told him

268
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:21,380
that “I will not move for you, because I don’t move for fools.”

269
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:26,041
So the other one moved on one side and he said, “I do.”

270
00:16:26,621 --> 00:16:29,581
Meaning, “I move out for fools,”

271
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,899
you see, but he said, “I do.” And he moved out.

272
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,220
So he has such a discretion – how far to go and how far not to go.

273
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:38,461
Now, I will give you an example how

274
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:41,221
in nature you can find this very easily.

275
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:44,580
See, the root has a little root cap.

276
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:46,741
It’s a very, very small minute thing,

277
00:16:46,981 --> 00:16:48,900
you have to see through the microscope.

278
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,826
Now this root cap is a wise thing.

279
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,430
It goes in the soil, it sees there are some stones,

280
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:57,219
so it goes around the stones.

281
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,499
Then it finds there are boulders. It goes around the boulders.

282
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,036
It has to find its way, so it's not bothered.

283
00:17:03,238 --> 00:17:04,940
“You are a boulder? All right, doesn’t matter,

284
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:06,574
I am not going to fight with you.”

285
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:10,170
It passes through that, it goes directly

286
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:13,181
to that place where it has to arrive,

287
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:16,711
and when it reaches that place, when he arrives that place,

288
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:20,433
what happens, he finds that he has tied up these boulders

289
00:17:20,635 --> 00:17:24,141
around himself to support the whole tree.

290
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:29,821
This is the wisdom of a little bit, small little cell

291
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:32,941
which is the root-end.

292
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:37,061
So you can imagine how much there is wisdom

293
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:40,900
in a little cell like that.

294
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,061
And God has given us such a good brain

295
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:46,501
and if we do not have discretion

296
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:48,900
we are like people who are blind,

297
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,540
who walk without knowing where they have to go.

298
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:58,821
So the first power of your innocence is awakened.

299
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:01,661
Innocent men cannot be harmed.

300
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:05,899
Those who try to harm the innocent men are harmed ultimately.

301
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,701
They are very severely harmed, and it is amazing sometimes

302
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:14,341
that the harm can be too much, too severe

303
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:17,461
and that’s why the compassion of Christ thought of it,

304
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:20,221
and He said, “Oh God, please forgive them,

305
00:18:20,422 --> 00:18:22,861
for they do not know what they are doing.”

306
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Because it could have been that

307
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:27,061
with the Father who is so wrathful,

308
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:29,900
they would have been all destroyed completely.

309
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,899
So the way He said, “Forgive them,

310
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,461
because I do not want

311
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:37,901
that these people, who are ignorant people,

312
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:41,541
who have tortured Me like this, should be destroyed.”

313
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:45,551
This is the sign of innocence.

314
00:18:46,181 --> 00:18:51,140
Then the second chakra, when it is awaken within you,

315
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:56,812
you have a special quality of creativity.

316
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:59,900
Because when the second chakra is awaken,

317
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,989
you are actually thoughtless, there’s no thought in your mind.

318
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,680
So you start looking at anything, without thinking.

319
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:13,861
You start looking at anything that is created

320
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,380
without any ripple of thought in your mind.

321
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:21,660
Like all that is created round the lake of your mind

322
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:28,029
is completely reflected in that ripple-less lake,

323
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:33,900
and you see the complete reflection of that creation,

324
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,900
as well as the joy that is bubbling in that creation.

325
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,900
So your creativity becomes tremendous.

326
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,483
You start seeing things, but not thinking about it.

327
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,900
Now, see if you come to this hall,

328
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,500
and you start seeing something, you like it,

329
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:54,421
then you start thinking, “Oh God, this is a beautiful thing,

330
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:57,900
but how much it must have cost? And now how old it is?

331
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Is it going to last or not? Is it insured or not?”

332
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,181
All sorts of funny ideas will come to you,

333
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:05,365
and you’ll never enjoy what it is.

334
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:07,980
But supposing you have no thought about it,

335
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:09,900
you just watch it, you just see it.

336
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:13,981
What happens? The creation that of the artist

337
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:16,020
who has created this beautiful thing,

338
00:20:16,221 --> 00:20:18,740
the joy of that creation that the artist had -

339
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:22,198
who might be dead now - you start enjoying that joy.

340
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:27,198
The whole thing can be filled in you with that bubbling joy

341
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:31,032
that he wanted to put there with his own heart.

342
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:34,141
And that’s what happens because there is no thought.

343
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:36,900
So the creativity becomes tremendous.

344
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,341
But it’s not only that the creativity is tremendous,

345
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,100
but your techniques even.

346
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:45,541
For example, a musician can become a tremendous musician.

347
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:50,421
People who have never done any work, can become extremely powerful.

348
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:53,500
We have somebody here from India.

349
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:55,299
The other day he was telling people,

350
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:57,678
because he gave one of the lectures,

351
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:00,327
that “I had never seen what is wood is.

352
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:03,900
I did not know what was teak, what was other wood and all that.”

353
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,900
And he had no job when he came to Me.

354
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,591
And he said, “Now, after Realization what job should I take?”

355
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:11,303
I said, “You take to interior decoration”, and he got a shock.

356
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:13,100
He said, “I don’t know what [to do].

357
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:14,968
How am I to take interior decoration?”

358
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:17,381
I said, “You can start feeling the vibrations.

359
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:20,261
You just do it on the basis on vibrations.”

360
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:23,100
And he did it, and he made a big money out of it,

361
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:25,221
because as I told you the other day,

362
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:28,341
whatever is absolutely beautiful you think,

363
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:31,181
has nothing in it but has vibrations.

364
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:34,500
It has a coefficient which gives you vibrations.

365
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:37,141
Like Mona Lisa now. We like her, Mona Lisa.

366
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:39,740
According to modern standards she cannot be a beauty

367
00:21:39,981 --> 00:21:42,961
because she was a very plump lady, an elderly lady.

368
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:46,661
But today also, if you go there, you cannot see her painting,

369
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:49,821
it’s so crowded, everybody’s anxious to see Mona Lisa.

370
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,900
And if you go and feel the vibrations,

371
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,900
from distance you’ll get vibrations,

372
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,901
because the coefficients of her body, face and everything

373
00:21:58,101 --> 00:22:01,100
is made so well, that you get the vibrations.

374
00:22:01,461 --> 00:22:05,099
Now people are very anxious to create new ideas,

375
00:22:05,301 --> 00:22:07,388
new type of things, and these,

376
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:09,815
but these things do not sell

377
00:22:10,016 --> 00:22:13,541
and even if they sell temporarily, they have no eternal values.

378
00:22:13,821 --> 00:22:17,421
So the people with this chakra enlightened,

379
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:23,036
start creating things of very eternal values,

380
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:25,349
of universal values.

381
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,564
Anywhere you take such a thing, you will take it to India,

382
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:32,141
you take it to China, you take it to Japan or you take it to America

383
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:36,100
anywhere, any human being who sees that,

384
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:39,900
sees the beauty of the Spirit,

385
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,861
because it gives you joy in your Spirit.

386
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,900
So the pure art is produced [through you].

387
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,321
That’s the purity,

388
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:51,381
or I would say the holy art is produced through you.

389
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:55,335
When you start producing that holy art, then you should believe

390
00:22:55,536 --> 00:22:59,900
that you have got an enlightenment on that chakra.

391
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,112
This chakra has another capacity,

392
00:23:02,313 --> 00:23:05,993
to transform your fat, for the use of your brain.

393
00:23:06,194 --> 00:23:09,981
And it works very hard for that, when you start thinking too much.

394
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,023
And by that over thinking,

395
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,667
what happens, that you develop all the diseases

396
00:23:14,868 --> 00:23:17,621
of the organs which it has to look after.

397
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:19,861
Like, it has to look after the liver,

398
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,900
it has to look after the pancreas, it has to look after the spleen,

399
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,101
it has to look after the parts of the intestine and the uterus.

400
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:31,068
So what happens that when you use this chakra

401
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:34,980
only for the use of thinking and thinking and thinking,

402
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:37,461
all these things go out of order.

403
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:41,716
And one by one you start developing diseases like diabetes,

404
00:23:41,917 --> 00:23:46,535
and then you start developing diseases of the stomach,

405
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:50,172
and sometimes the spleen, and all other diseases

406
00:23:50,373 --> 00:23:52,400
which are very dangerous, that the,

407
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:55,297
as you can call the blood cancer and all those things,

408
00:23:55,498 --> 00:23:57,860
out of this kind of mad thinking.

409
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,141
Now to tell you that you shouldn’t think too much,

410
00:24:01,381 --> 00:24:04,533
you shouldn’t bother too much, you should not be wobbly,

411
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,327
you should take things easy, be light-hearted,

412
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:09,375
is not possible in the modern times

413
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:11,420
because we are slaves of the watch.

414
00:24:11,621 --> 00:24:15,780
But what happens, that when you get Realization,

415
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:18,301
your thinking process becomes regulated.

416
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,221
You only think when you have to think.

417
00:24:20,422 --> 00:24:22,900
You just go on thinking, thinking, like horns coming out.

418
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,220
You don’t think like that. You only think when you have to think.

419
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:30,259
And whatever you think comes from you inspiration as such.

420
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:34,221
Now for time, you see, My watch is always out of order.

421
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:39,099
I deliberately keep it out of order, because the time is

422
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:43,141
in your hands.

423
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,941
Supposing these people will hurry Me up too much,

424
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:49,243
“Mother we have go now, we’ll miss
the plane, this thing, that thing.”

425
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:51,232
 I said, “All right, if you say I’ll go.”

426
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:53,129
I go to the airport

427
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,540
and there they find the plane is three hours late.

428
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:57,900
Then they said, “Mother, why didn’t you tell us?”

429
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,221
I said, “I was telling you, no need to hurry up.

430
00:25:00,461 --> 00:25:01,980
Why didn’t you telephone and find out?

431
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:05,341
If you had telephoned, we would not have been there earlier.”

432
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:08,357
So you see, you start seeing

433
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:13,030
that this time is best for this, this time is best for that.

434
00:25:13,231 --> 00:25:15,512
You don’t have to become a slave of the watch.

435
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:18,048
Like this, people become such slaves

436
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:23,100
that they arrive at a point where there can be

437
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:25,341
some sort of a wrong thing happening

438
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:29,100
or maybe that you reach the place
and you have to wait for four hours,

439
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:33,127
you have to do all kinds of arrangements

440
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:35,039
to make yourself comfortable.

441
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,181
Or sometimes it so happens that you quarrel with your wife,

442
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:40,572
quarrel with your husband, quarrel with your children,

443
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,514
“Oh, we are getting late, we are getting late

444
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:43,831
we have to be on the time.”

445
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:45,899
All this madness comes to people

446
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,501
because they have not got their Realization.

447
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:51,421
Once you get Realization, you station down.

448
00:25:51,661 --> 00:25:54,461
You are very much at ease with yourself.

449
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:57,820
You don’t hurry others and you don’t trouble others.

450
00:25:58,061 --> 00:26:01,340
Like small, small things, how much we trouble by our worries.

451
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:05,101
You see, human beings will go on saying, “I’m worried.”

452
00:26:05,341 --> 00:26:08,021
But what’s the use of worrying? Now if I tell you, “Don’t worry”

453
00:26:08,221 --> 00:26:09,405
you cannot stop it.

454
00:26:09,607 --> 00:26:11,621
But once the hole is made here,

455
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,821
which we call the Brahmarandhra is opened,

456
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:16,381
then there’s a hole out of which the worry comes out,

457
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:18,621
and then you just cannot worry.

458
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:20,861
Even if you want to worry, you won’t worry;

459
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,901
because somehow or other you go beyond that nonsense of worrying.

460
00:26:26,621 --> 00:26:30,541
In any way, mentally I cannot convince you that you don’t worry.

461
00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:33,021
But once you get Realization, you’ll be amazed,

462
00:26:33,221 --> 00:26:35,221
you’ll be just enjoying yourself.

463
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,941
Even if you are late, you are not going to bother about

464
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:40,141
or trouble others and you will find

465
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:42,301
that you’ll be are always in time for things,

466
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,261
because there is a force,

467
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:47,781
this All Pervading Power of God looks after you.

468
00:26:48,021 --> 00:26:50,381
You start believing in it, how it works out.

469
00:26:50,621 --> 00:26:53,221
You won’t believe how much it helps,

470
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:57,701
how much it works out, how it can operate

471
00:26:57,941 --> 00:27:00,100
just beyond description.

472
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:02,747
I mean, I’ll tell you a story which you won’t believe.

473
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,736
Did I tell them yesterday about the boy who fainted?

474
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:07,660
SY: I don't think so, Mother.
SM: No.

475
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:09,900
SM: A story about Myself,

476
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,900
and then a story about Warren I can tell you.

477
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,821
It’s in the newspaper, so you can believe it.

478
00:27:16,061 --> 00:27:18,301
I was giving a lecture in Bedford

479
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:21,581
and that was from seven to ten

480
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:24,341
and about eight o’clock a boy fell down somewhere,

481
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:27,900
about I don’t know ten-fifteen miles from a bridge.

482
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,381
Very deep down he fell down from his motorbike.

483
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:33,751
And they sent for an ambulance.

484
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,271
They got frightened; they thought this boy must be dead,

485
00:27:36,472 --> 00:27:38,500
to fall down to this extent.

486
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:41,901
So the ambulance came in and when the ambulance came in,

487
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:44,261
this boy just walked up, and he came up

488
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:46,021
and he sat in the ambulance.

489
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:47,900
So they said, “How are you?”

490
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,900
He said “I’m all right, nothing wrong with me.”

491
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,702
So they said, “But nothing happened to you.”

492
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,581
He said, “No, I broke lots of things

493
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:56,187
but a Lady came in a white clothes,

494
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:58,753
in a white Mercedes (that’s My car),

495
00:27:58,954 --> 00:28:02,100
and She walked down up to me and She cured me.

496
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:07,141
And only She left the lower portion of my bone,

497
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:09,581
and She said that, You come for this to Me,

498
00:28:09,782 --> 00:28:11,781
and the rest is I’m perfectly all right, see."

499
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,821
They couldn’t believe it, you see.

500
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:16,421
And the police was there, and everybody was there.

501
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:20,548
And the next day he saw My photograph in the newspaper,

502
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:22,621
and he informed them, he informed the police,

503
00:28:22,822 --> 00:28:24,545
“This is the Lady Who came and cured me.”

504
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,621
So they telephoned our people, and ask them,

505
00:28:26,861 --> 00:28:27,941
“Did She pass this way that day?”

506
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:30,341
They said, “That time She was just giving lecture

507
00:28:30,581 --> 00:28:32,740
before six hundred people. She was not there.”

508
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:35,900
So they were quite amazed, how it has happened. But it can happen.

509
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,341
It’s nothing new. I mean it has happened many a times.

510
00:28:38,661 --> 00:28:41,301
But one of these that has appeared in the newspaper is like that.

511
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,100
Now, how does this happen?

512
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:46,741
God has got wonderful television also, perfect,

513
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:49,181
it’s so systematic, it’s so scientific.

514
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:54,020
How it works, that for that you have to just see and wonder.

515
00:28:54,221 --> 00:28:57,820
He has got telecommunication, He has got computers,

516
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,221
He has got everything that you have created,

517
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:04,094
but extremely efficient and methodical.

518
00:29:04,295 --> 00:29:06,980
You don’t have to worry, it just works out.

519
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:09,540
There are so many things that have happened,

520
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,821
like you have heard that Christ gave bread,

521
00:29:13,061 --> 00:29:15,900
five bread and fish to so many people.

522
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,341
It’s nothing new to now Sahaja Yogis.

523
00:29:18,581 --> 00:29:20,100
They have seen this many a times happening,

524
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,941
in our groups and in our camps.

525
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:24,980
But another thing which is not believable

526
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:27,221
but it has happened to one Mr. Warren,

527
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:29,099
Dr. Warren, who is here from Australia.

528
00:29:29,341 --> 00:29:32,900
When he came to India and he got his Realization,

529
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,367
and when he went back he said,

530
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:37,476
“I must now start talking about Sahaja Yoga

531
00:29:37,677 --> 00:29:39,261
and giving Realization to people.”

532
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:44,461
And when he went back to Australia there was a petrol crisis.

533
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:47,540
And there was no petrol in his car, about to finish,

534
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:49,434
so they thought, “Now, what to do?

535
00:29:49,635 --> 00:29:52,181
We’ll not have any petrol. How to do Mother’s work?”

536
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:53,750
So they said, “Lets try.

537
00:29:53,952 --> 00:29:57,621
We’ll just go wherever we want, we’ll not look at the petrol.”

538
00:29:57,861 --> 00:30:01,581
And they did this for twenty-one days, continuously,

539
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:04,723
and when they went to the petrol pump after twenty-one days,

540
00:30:04,924 --> 00:30:07,740
because the petrol pumps had opened out,

541
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:09,980
the petrol pump fellow said that,

542
00:30:10,182 --> 00:30:14,900
“There is hardly one liter space there. What am I to fill in?”

543
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,381
And they were amazed, they did it twenty-one days. It can happen.

544
00:30:18,741 --> 00:30:21,899
You do not know when you say God is Almighty,

545
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,901
when we say that He can do whatever He wants to do.

546
00:30:25,101 --> 00:30:26,261
He does everything.

547
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:29,981
When we say that we are not aware that what He can do.

548
00:30:30,253 --> 00:30:34,179
We just think that at the most He can make flowers into fruits,

549
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,900
at the most He can make our heart beat,

550
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:40,980
at the most He can make us from amoeba to human being.

551
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:42,900
But just think of it,

552
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,420
how far He can go,

553
00:30:45,621 --> 00:30:47,661
and how capable He is

554
00:30:47,901 --> 00:30:53,410
and how full of compassion He is for His own creation.

555
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:56,501
Now you have to enter into that area.

556
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:58,861
First of all, unless and until you are there,

557
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,781
you are really blessed by God,

558
00:31:01,021 --> 00:31:04,170
you cannot believe it how it helps.

559
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:10,100
Thirdly, the third center, is the center of your seeking,

560
00:31:10,341 --> 00:31:13,661
as he has told you, is the center of your seeking.

561
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:16,781
Now the seeking gets satisfied

562
00:31:17,221 --> 00:31:22,181
in the sense that you feel you are no more to seek,

563
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:24,101
now you have to give.

564
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,701
You are asking for the light,

565
00:31:26,941 --> 00:31:29,900
you have got the light, and you have to give the light.

566
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,393
But you do not develop the fanatic attitude

567
00:31:33,594 --> 00:31:37,135
that, “I am the right person, and you are the wrong person”

568
00:31:37,337 --> 00:31:40,123
and that kind of a violent nature,

569
00:31:40,324 --> 00:31:43,861
but you develop a very gentle and a kindly

570
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,301
and affectionate nature towards that person.

571
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:49,141
Because you have gone through that kind of an experience,

572
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:51,661
so you know that this person is ignorant.

573
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:54,701
Gradually when he will see the light, he will understand.

574
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:57,781
So you don’t force your way onto him, at all.

575
00:31:58,021 --> 00:32:01,978
On the contrary you allow that person to slowly

576
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:06,740
take to it, and awaken his Kundalini and see for himself

577
00:32:06,981 --> 00:32:08,781
so that he should certify himself.

578
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:11,141
You don’t force him to say things,

579
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:12,977
you do not organize him,

580
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:16,588
you do not make him a member,

581
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:18,899
you do not take money from him, nothing.

582
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,141
You leave him alone. If he wants to come, he can come.

583
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:25,024
If he does not want to come, he need not come.

584
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:28,221
In Sahaja Yoga, we have made it compulsory

585
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:30,060
that all the centers we are running,

586
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:33,421
no young boys should come who are below age

587
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:35,181
without the permission of their parents,

588
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:37,581
even to visit, leave alone living there.

589
00:32:37,821 --> 00:32:42,141
So that, that’s how we allow only those people

590
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:46,700
who are grown up, adults, to come with their own wishes.

591
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:48,233
They are not to be forced.

592
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:51,904
If they want to go today, we’ll say, “All right, go just now.”

593
00:32:52,802 --> 00:32:55,741
There is no compulsion on anyone,

594
00:32:55,981 --> 00:32:58,981
because one thing you must know, that you cannot compel

595
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:01,900
as far as your Self Realization is concerned.

596
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,981
Because it is of no use.

597
00:33:04,181 --> 00:33:06,941
It has to come through your freedom,

598
00:33:07,141 --> 00:33:10,260
through your asking, otherwise we cannot work it out.

599
00:33:10,501 --> 00:33:14,221
Unless and until you ask for it, we cannot do it,

600
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:15,701
it is an impossibility.

601
00:33:15,941 --> 00:33:18,067
So you must understand that

602
00:33:18,258 --> 00:33:21,093
I cannot force you to get Realization.

603
00:33:21,294 --> 00:33:22,581
It has to work out.

604
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:26,635
If it works out, you are a lucky person. I cannot guarantee it.

605
00:33:26,836 --> 00:33:29,780
If it works out that means it is your own,

606
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:33,381
and if it has not worked out and if you want to work Me out

607
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:36,021
or anybody to work it out, they’ll work it out.

608
00:33:36,221 --> 00:33:39,900
But it cannot be guaranteed, it cannot be promised.

609
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,301
So your seeking stops and what happens

610
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:46,970
that you start looking at yourself

611
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:49,624
and seeing your own glory,

612
00:33:49,815 --> 00:33:52,820
and understanding your own powers,

613
00:33:53,021 --> 00:33:55,061
get yourself cleaned out,

614
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:00,114
and you want to give others that solace that you have got,

615
00:34:00,315 --> 00:34:02,661
that Realization that you have got.

616
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:06,221
So, I always say that I’m the greatest capitalist,

617
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,796
because if I have all the powers I’m the greatest capitalist,

618
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:11,900
and I’m the greatest communist

619
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:14,701
because I cannot live without distributing you.

620
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,821
I must distribute. When we talk of capitalism,

621
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:20,099
what do you have? These stones? What do you have?

622
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,980
What do you distribute? The stones?

623
00:34:22,181 --> 00:34:23,941
And what are you a communist? What are you distributing?

624
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:25,340
Only stones.

625
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:29,099
So there is nothing to be proud of these worldly possessions.

626
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,980
What you are to be proud of,

627
00:34:31,181 --> 00:34:33,260
or to be conscious of, is your Spirit.

628
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:38,421
Spirit is the only thing that can kindle another Spirit.

629
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:42,900
I have not seen any matter can kindle that joy in anyone.

630
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,388
At the most if you give some matter to somebody, at the most,

631
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:49,915
that is the only advantage of having some material thing is

632
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:51,659
that you can give away,

633
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:55,181
that you can express your love through some material things.

634
00:34:55,421 --> 00:34:58,421
But otherwise the matter has no value of any kind.

635
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,301
But Spirit has absolute value,

636
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:04,541
because it can kindle light into another’s life,

637
00:35:04,781 --> 00:35:08,061
and there cannot be anything better than to be given to anyone else.

638
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:12,301
No amount of money, no amount of empires,

639
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:15,181
nothing can give that which is the Spirit,

640
00:35:15,421 --> 00:35:17,461
because the Spirit is the ultimate.

641
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:20,108
After that you don’t seek anything.

642
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:23,821
That’s what is the Kundalini, is the true desire

643
00:35:24,061 --> 00:35:26,901
which wants to become the reality,

644
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:29,900
which wants to become the divinity.

645
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,261
To get divinity within you is the highest thing,

646
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:35,261
and that’s what once you get,

647
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:37,861
you don’t want anything else.

648
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,741
So the seeking starts improving.

649
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:43,780
Around the seeking are the Ten Commandments, you can say,

650
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:46,283
or the ten primordial masters.

651
00:35:46,484 --> 00:35:49,701
There are many others, but the primordial masters, the ten,

652
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:51,900
who came on this earth, one after another,

653
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,085
to teach us how to balance ourselves.

654
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:57,380
After Realization I’ve seen people automatically balance.

655
00:35:57,621 --> 00:36:00,141
I don’t tell them anything about Ten Commandments.

656
00:36:00,381 --> 00:36:02,501
I don’t say “Don’t”, I never say.

657
00:36:02,741 --> 00:36:04,487
I said, “You get your Realization.”

658
00:36:04,689 --> 00:36:07,899
Once they get Realization they just start

659
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,900
behaving in such a manner that is extremely righteous,

660
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,860
extremely balanced, extremely holy.

661
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,500
Such a person becomes immediately

662
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:23,261
rid of all the horrible habits they have,

663
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:28,688
all the enslavement of passion, and lust and greed.

664
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:30,620
Everything drops out just like that,

665
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:36,232
and like a beautiful lotus they come out of that mire,

666
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:41,900
that darkness, into light.

667
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,139
And then in the light they see it so clearly,

668
00:36:46,341 --> 00:36:49,460
that this is not the thing that I can have,

669
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:51,900
this is not the thing that I can wear,

670
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,821
and immediately they give it up.

671
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:56,661
That’s how you become a new personality.

672
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:58,927
This religion is born within you.

673
00:36:59,128 --> 00:37:02,471
Now we talk of religion, this religion that religion, that religion.

674
00:37:02,672 --> 00:37:04,420
Everybody is talking of different religions

675
00:37:04,661 --> 00:37:06,021
and dogmas, and this and that,

676
00:37:06,222 --> 00:37:08,221
and only fighting everywhere you go.

677
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:10,821
They are fighting among each other, it’s still going on.

678
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,540
It’s endless; they are all fighting morning till evening.

679
00:37:14,781 --> 00:37:17,541
Then I have seen also some people who try to unite religions

680
00:37:17,781 --> 00:37:21,020
and there also they have nothing but all the devils put together,

681
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:22,900
all devils joined together to unite.

682
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,341
There is nothing of reality in them.

683
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:29,100
So the people are puzzled, “What is happening to religion?”

684
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:32,621
These organized religions also can be very dangerous.

685
00:37:32,901 --> 00:37:35,701
They can put you into such norms that you can really

686
00:37:35,941 --> 00:37:38,621
get absolutely brain-washed,

687
00:37:38,861 --> 00:37:41,421
and you start believing that what you are doing is correct,

688
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:44,221
without understanding why are you doing it.

689
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:47,661
Most of the things tell, “This is a mystery, that is a mystery.”

690
00:37:47,901 --> 00:37:49,461
Then why, what are you doing there?

691
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,498
If it is a mystery, it is better you give up.

692
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:54,392
But they’ll just brand you that “This is mystery, that is mystery”.

693
00:37:54,593 --> 00:37:55,780
You have to accept.

694
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:58,021
But what is the advantage of that kind of a life,

695
00:37:58,221 --> 00:37:59,420
nobody wants to see.

696
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:02,860
As I told you, that Christ has asked for one thing,

697
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,701
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”,

698
00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:10,830
and let us see which religious organization

699
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:12,621
has granted that to people.

700
00:38:12,861 --> 00:38:16,076
It’s only your Spirit, when It is awakened and reborn,

701
00:38:16,277 --> 00:38:18,340
you can have that innocence within you.

702
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:21,741
As it is today, it’s getting late,

703
00:38:21,981 --> 00:38:24,261
but I have to tell you that the chakras

704
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:27,821
as he explained, I am just giving you the powers of every chakra.

705
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:34,847
And the power of the chakra of heart is tremendous.

706
00:38:35,701 --> 00:38:39,600
It gives you the fearlessness.

707
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:42,941
When the child is about twelve years of age,

708
00:38:43,141 --> 00:38:47,899
in this sternum bone, the antibodies are created by this chakra.

709
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,235
And they are sent all over the body

710
00:38:50,436 --> 00:38:54,899
to fight the disease or any kind of an attack on the personality.

711
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:59,981
Now, these are actually looked after by the deity in that center,

712
00:39:00,301 --> 00:39:04,741
and this deity, when gets the message,

713
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:10,900
She informs all the antibodies that “You have to fight.”

714
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,750
And all of them will go at that point, join together,

715
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:19,100
to fight the enemy of life, enemy of God.

716
00:39:19,722 --> 00:39:23,540
Like now we are having, now I’m here,

717
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:27,100
and Americans are to be realized,

718
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:29,860
and we have to do something about America.

719
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,420
Then knowing that how America is important -

720
00:39:33,661 --> 00:39:36,899
I’ll tell you where America is in this body -

721
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,701
people from Australia, from India,

722
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,460
from France, from all over,

723
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,100
have come down here.

724
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,101
All the way they have come,

725
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:53,140
just to give Realization to Americans.

726
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:57,020
All of them. I never forced anybody, I never asked anybody,

727
00:39:57,221 --> 00:39:59,981
they just came forward, “Mother, we are going to go with You,

728
00:40:00,181 --> 00:40:03,855
and we are going to do this great work of Realization

729
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:07,460
to people of America who are seekers.”

730
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:10,941
They all have come on their own, spending their own money,

731
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:13,206
and they are doing this work with Me.

732
00:40:13,407 --> 00:40:19,905
So you can image what a great attraction it must be,

733
00:40:20,106 --> 00:40:24,301
what a great attachment it must be, for the seekers of America,

734
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:27,861
that they have come all the way. They are all people on big jobs

735
00:40:28,062 --> 00:40:31,029
one is a doctor, another is an architect, another is this,

736
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,900
all of them sacrificing their money, everything, time

737
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,819
have come down here to be with Me for these two months

738
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:41,231
to work for America, from all over.

739
00:40:41,432 --> 00:40:43,948
We have some people who are actresses

740
00:40:44,149 --> 00:40:50,230
in the English drama

741
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,461
or some are directors and things like that.

742
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,181
They all have come here.

743
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:57,061
In your Boston we have at least,

744
00:40:57,261 --> 00:40:59,900
I think, ten people from ten countries.

745
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:05,889
So you can imagine how is the whole attention, the priority.

746
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:09,261
This is the important thing. They must get Realization.

747
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:11,621
They do not get any money out of it;

748
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:13,900
they do not get any reward out of it,

749
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,020
only the satisfaction that so many have got Realization.

750
00:41:18,335 --> 00:41:21,461
The more, the merrier. When they see more people coming

751
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:24,899
getting Realization, you must see their faces, they lit up.

752
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,341
This kind of a personality people have not seen.

753
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:30,500
I had one bishop

754
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:33,659
who came to stay with Me in My house in London,

755
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:36,061
and when he saw Sahaja Yogis, he said,

756
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:39,100
“This is a rare caste and community. I have never seen such a...

757
00:41:39,461 --> 00:41:42,341
So I’ve been telling people to do little things

758
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:44,981
in life, they cannot do it and look at these people,

759
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:49,261
how beautiful they are. I can’t believe how can they be so nice.”

760
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:51,661
Because your Spirit is beautiful,

761
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:53,701
the Spirit is glorious,

762
00:41:53,941 --> 00:41:55,741
and when you become that,

763
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:59,021
automatically it starts manifesting its beauty.

764
00:41:59,221 --> 00:42:02,100
You don’t have to tell yourself, you’ll be amazed at yourself

765
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:04,460
how you have become so beautiful,

766
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:07,021
and so good and so nice.

767
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:10,661
So this quality of fearlessness comes to you

768
00:42:10,901 --> 00:42:12,900
because your antibodies

769
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,460
are completely charged with the power of the Spirit.

770
00:42:17,821 --> 00:42:21,181
And you start understanding what sort of a disease is coming,

771
00:42:21,461 --> 00:42:23,661
what sort of an attack is coming,

772
00:42:23,893 --> 00:42:26,024
and your body knows how to fight it.

773
00:42:26,225 --> 00:42:29,341
You know how to fight it, and when you know that,

774
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:31,732
you are not afraid of any disease whatsoever,

775
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:33,380
even it is cancer, anything,

776
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:37,260
people know how to fight it themselves and for others.

777
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:41,540
Now the higher chakra is of Vishuddhi chakra

778
00:42:41,741 --> 00:42:45,021
and this chakra is what America is.

779
00:42:45,221 --> 00:42:48,460
In the Universe this is the chakra,

780
00:42:48,701 --> 00:42:53,039
Vishuddhi chakra, is what America represents.

781
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,621
Because America has a responsibility,

782
00:42:55,861 --> 00:42:57,765
this center has the responsibility.

783
00:42:58,006 --> 00:43:00,408
When they raise the head,

784
00:43:02,278 --> 00:43:05,021
human beings, then this center developed

785
00:43:05,221 --> 00:43:08,129
the responsibility to be human beings.

786
00:43:09,221 --> 00:43:11,900
And the responsibility of spirituality

787
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,924
lies on the shoulders of Americans.

788
00:43:15,581 --> 00:43:20,071
You had great people like Abraham Lincoln,

789
00:43:20,272 --> 00:43:24,500
very great people here professing about

790
00:43:25,781 --> 00:43:29,301
freedom of your country and big ideal things.

791
00:43:29,664 --> 00:43:33,341
But to My dismay I find: where are those gone?

792
00:43:33,581 --> 00:43:35,211
Where are those people

793
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:38,141
who will take the responsibility of spirituality?

794
00:43:38,381 --> 00:43:42,421
They are lost with fake gurus, they are lost with cults,

795
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:46,780
they are lost with all kinds of things and where are they?

796
00:43:46,981 --> 00:43:50,100
It’s such a sad thing that the responsibility

797
00:43:50,301 --> 00:43:52,380
which was on the shoulders of Americans

798
00:43:52,621 --> 00:43:55,581
has been not properly tackled, at all.

799
00:43:55,782 --> 00:43:59,021
But now the time is – though we start slowly,

800
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:02,341
let us take up the responsibility and see for ourselves,

801
00:44:02,581 --> 00:44:05,900
what we can do for our countrymen, for our people,

802
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,500
and on the hole for the whole world.

803
00:44:08,741 --> 00:44:11,940
You can do a lot, because that is your specialty

804
00:44:12,141 --> 00:44:15,333
that is your job, which has to be done.

805
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:20,141
Now this chakra gives you the power to be the witness.

806
00:44:20,381 --> 00:44:23,181
First power you get that you become the witness

807
00:44:23,421 --> 00:44:26,581
– witness of everything. The whole thing becomes like a drama,

808
00:44:26,821 --> 00:44:30,420
like you are in the water, and then you suddenly come in a boat

809
00:44:30,661 --> 00:44:34,501
and you start seeing the play of all these waves.

810
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:37,487
You are no more afraid, you just start seeing it as a drama;

811
00:44:37,689 --> 00:44:39,074
you become a witness.

812
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:41,549
The second thing that happens to you with this,

813
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,061
that you become collectively conscious.

814
00:44:44,261 --> 00:44:48,460
Your hands, if this chakra is good, start feeling the cool breeze,

815
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:52,820
start feeling the chakras of yourself and chakras of other people.

816
00:44:53,021 --> 00:44:55,340
With your hands you can cure people,

817
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:57,661
with your hands you can raise the Kundalini,

818
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,581
with your hands you can give Realization.

819
00:44:59,821 --> 00:45:02,743
These hands become powerful things.

820
00:45:03,261 --> 00:45:06,261
Even the movement of these hands has a meaning;

821
00:45:06,493 --> 00:45:08,268
everything has a meaning.

822
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:12,100
Whatever it does, little fingers, they all have a meaning

823
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:14,420
and because they get enlightened.

824
00:45:14,661 --> 00:45:16,781
Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly,

825
00:45:16,982 --> 00:45:20,389
“At the time of resurrection your hands will speak.”

826
00:45:21,397 --> 00:45:24,540
Now if you talk to any Muslims,

827
00:45:24,781 --> 00:45:28,139
they will say, “We have never heard of Resurrection day.”

828
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,326
Find in the Koran, if you see,

829
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,029
most of it is dealt with the resurrection day,

830
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,290
and the doomsday is very little.

831
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:39,100
But people will talk about the doomsday

832
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:41,621
because they can frighten others with that

833
00:45:41,861 --> 00:45:45,181
and have their own cults and own things.

834
00:45:45,421 --> 00:45:48,781
But actually the resurrection day is the most important thing.

835
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:53,246
And for which Mohammed Sahib has clearly said the future.

836
00:45:53,447 --> 00:45:56,421
He didn’t say that, “I’m the last, now nothing is going to happen.”

837
00:45:56,661 --> 00:46:01,061
He said, “At the time of resurrection, your hands will speak.”

838
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:03,061
And that’s exactly what happens,

839
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:06,460
that you start feeling others on your fingertips.

840
00:46:06,741 --> 00:46:08,505
You know through your fingertips

841
00:46:08,707 --> 00:46:12,421
what centers are catching in another person or in yourself also,

842
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:16,301
and immediately you start improving it, if you know how to do it.

843
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:19,581
And that’s what you have to learn: is the divine technique,

844
00:46:19,782 --> 00:46:25,377
the true knowledge, of how to handle this power of Divine Love,

845
00:46:25,578 --> 00:46:27,677
that is flowing through you.

846
00:46:28,168 --> 00:46:31,900
So this center is very important, I think, for Americans.

847
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,940
It has one side by which people are aggressive.

848
00:46:36,141 --> 00:46:41,155
When they talk they’re bumptious, they are ego oriented,

849
00:46:41,356 --> 00:46:43,701
they try to suppress others by their speeches

850
00:46:43,941 --> 00:46:46,420
and try to dominate others when they talk

851
00:46:46,621 --> 00:46:48,354
– these are the right sided people.

852
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,981
The other side are the left sided people when they feel guilty,

853
00:46:52,181 --> 00:46:54,661
they think they have done this wrong, and that wrong,

854
00:46:54,901 --> 00:46:56,421
they should not have done this wrong.

855
00:46:56,661 --> 00:46:58,461
Actually I’ve seen that in America

856
00:46:58,701 --> 00:47:01,741
most of the people have problems here, most surprising,

857
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:04,692
They are all the time shaking their neck like this, all the time.

858
00:47:04,893 --> 00:47:08,061
In My program also I’ve seen, they have always a problem here.

859
00:47:08,261 --> 00:47:11,581
The thing is that they have a greater responsibility

860
00:47:11,821 --> 00:47:13,484
to keep this center the best,

861
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:16,449
by keeping the responsibility of spirituality

862
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,900
quite the highest priority.

863
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,301
They should have the highest priority.

864
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:24,906
But what you find that all the people are coming

865
00:47:25,107 --> 00:47:27,300
from all over the world to help the Americans.

866
00:47:27,501 --> 00:47:30,866
A day should come when the Americans should go all over the world

867
00:47:31,067 --> 00:47:32,261
to give Realization.

868
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:34,646
And I’m sure that day will come one day

869
00:47:34,821 --> 00:47:37,485
when you will grow up to that sense of responsibility

870
00:47:37,686 --> 00:47:40,304
when this center will really stand up,

871
00:47:40,505 --> 00:47:42,903
as a spiritual personality.

872
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:47,442
Now, the higher center is of Agnya chakra which

873
00:47:47,644 --> 00:47:52,202
he has told you about, is the center when you get Realization,

874
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:54,540
and when the Kundalini rises above that,

875
00:47:54,741 --> 00:47:57,598
you become thoughtlessly aware.

876
00:47:58,054 --> 00:48:02,980
Now at this time you get the power first of all of curing people.

877
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:05,021
If you touch somebody, he’s cured.

878
00:48:05,221 --> 00:48:07,021
If you say something, that happens.

879
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:10,420
If you go in the house, something good comes in that house.

880
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:12,858
Auspiciousness starts working through you,

881
00:48:12,978 --> 00:48:14,412
when this center is opened.

882
00:48:14,613 --> 00:48:16,381
But one should not leave at that center,

883
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:19,604
because if you start moving onto the left, or to the right,

884
00:48:19,805 --> 00:48:21,620
you'll get into problems.

885
00:48:21,821 --> 00:48:24,621
If that center starts moving onto the right,

886
00:48:24,822 --> 00:48:27,861
then you start seeing visions, which is a very wrong thing.

887
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,179
You go into the realm of supra-conscious

888
00:48:30,381 --> 00:48:32,221
or into the collective supra-conscious,

889
00:48:32,461 --> 00:48:34,861
by you can become a very ego oriented person.

890
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,899
You can be a very violent, hot tempered, quarrelsome person.

891
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,221
Actually, Hitler used this.

892
00:48:41,461 --> 00:48:44,941
Hitler used this method from the lamas he learnt,

893
00:48:45,141 --> 00:48:48,900
and he put people onto the right side of the supraconscious,

894
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,779
into collective supraconscious and put the spirits, dead spirits,

895
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:58,261
who were of the people who were extremely ambitious and cruel.

896
00:48:58,581 --> 00:49:00,900
That’s how this cruelty came into the Germans

897
00:49:01,062 --> 00:49:02,985
and they forgot what they were.

898
00:49:03,187 --> 00:49:04,661
They forgot they were human beings,

899
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,900
the way they killed, the way they behaved,

900
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,581
it’s impossible for any human being to do that.

901
00:49:09,782 --> 00:49:11,880
But he managed this, and is written down

902
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:16,221
that he got all this from lamas from Tibet.

903
00:49:16,461 --> 00:49:18,900
From there he got the knowledge how to put people

904
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,540
onto the collective supraconscious.

905
00:49:21,741 --> 00:49:24,021
Now the people who can go to the left side,

906
00:49:24,221 --> 00:49:27,541
also start curing people, they start...

907
00:49:28,877 --> 00:49:31,581
In such a company you might just get stunned.

908
00:49:31,821 --> 00:49:34,261
If you face such a person you might just get stunned.

909
00:49:34,501 --> 00:49:41,020
Or you might get a kind of a complete attraction for such a person

910
00:49:41,221 --> 00:49:44,380
You might get completely under the domination of such a person.

911
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:47,061
You might surrender completely to such a person,

912
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:48,975
and you will not know what you are doing,

913
00:49:49,176 --> 00:49:51,475
till that person has completely destroyed you.

914
00:49:51,676 --> 00:49:54,500
This type of people have these horrible powers

915
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:57,141
because they enter into the collective subconscious.

916
00:49:57,381 --> 00:49:59,683
And when they enter into the collective subconscious,

917
00:49:59,884 --> 00:50:04,021
they gather those spirits, which they use.

918
00:50:04,865 --> 00:50:08,900
But the people, who as it is, move to the left side,

919
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:14,261
who cry, weep, emotional, feel guilty all the time

920
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:17,621
miserable people, they jump onto the left side.

921
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:20,713
Now all the diseases, practically most of them,

922
00:50:20,914 --> 00:50:24,668
like AIDS, like cancer, like myelitis.

923
00:50:24,869 --> 00:50:27,661
All these diseases come from the left sided entry

924
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:29,941
and is accepted by the doctors;

925
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:32,781
because I’ve seen a very good film made by the doctors,

926
00:50:32,982 --> 00:50:34,500
who were researching on cancer,

927
00:50:34,741 --> 00:50:37,581
that when the body is vulnerable to these diseases,

928
00:50:37,821 --> 00:50:41,741
means when you are over-exerting yourself,

929
00:50:41,981 --> 00:50:45,341
when there is too much of sympathetic activity in a person,

930
00:50:45,581 --> 00:50:48,821
and when a person is absolutely fagged out with it,

931
00:50:49,061 --> 00:50:51,162
at that time, they say,

932
00:50:51,363 --> 00:50:53,715
that these diseases are triggered into you,

933
00:50:53,858 --> 00:50:55,380
that somebody triggers it.

934
00:50:55,581 --> 00:51:00,191
And what is this they call, is the protein 52, and protein 58,

935
00:51:00,392 --> 00:51:02,643
and all these names they give because doctors don’t know

936
00:51:02,844 --> 00:51:04,112
that they are dead spirits.

937
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:06,888
And these are the things when they enter into you

938
00:51:07,089 --> 00:51:08,237
then they trigger it.

939
00:51:08,439 --> 00:51:10,235
But they say something very right,

940
00:51:10,355 --> 00:51:12,399
and that is that these things come

941
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,572
from the area built in you since your creation,

942
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:18,392
means your collective subconscious.

943
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:20,821
And that I have been saying for so many years.

944
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:22,660
Now recently I saw this film.

945
00:51:22,861 --> 00:51:26,661
So they are coming to the same point, but after such a long time,

946
00:51:26,901 --> 00:51:28,581
that it is triggered by them.

947
00:51:28,821 --> 00:51:32,540
So those people who go too much to the left get this trouble.

948
00:51:33,061 --> 00:51:38,460
Those who go too much to the right get heart trouble, heart attacks;

949
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:42,620
but not the slow attack, because heart has double type of attacks,

950
00:51:42,821 --> 00:51:46,060
it can a be slow heart or it can be a fast heart.

951
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:49,061
The people who go on the right side have everything fast,

952
00:51:49,261 --> 00:51:51,821
liver is moving fast, everything moving fast,

953
00:51:52,022 --> 00:51:55,069
it’s such a speedy temperament because they are so speedy.

954
00:51:55,271 --> 00:51:57,873
In the morning they’ll get up, “Now I have to go to the office”

955
00:51:58,016 --> 00:52:00,332
and they’ll be taking the breakfast in one hand,

956
00:52:00,533 --> 00:52:02,951
putting one foot in the trousers,

957
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:06,381
and another hand into the coat, running to the car,

958
00:52:06,621 --> 00:52:09,301
and there's a big another jam coming up

959
00:52:09,581 --> 00:52:12,899
and then swearing at everything and it’s a mess throughout.

960
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,781
And the whole body gets messed up.

961
00:52:15,021 --> 00:52:17,414
And when the whole body gets messed up,

962
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:19,875
then what happens, that your speedometer

963
00:52:20,076 --> 00:52:22,420
which is the spleen also goes out of order

964
00:52:22,621 --> 00:52:25,301
and you develop a funny type of temperament.

965
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:28,061
If you say them that, “We have to go now to the airport”

966
00:52:28,261 --> 00:52:30,621
you see them absolutely gone as they are wobbly.

967
00:52:30,861 --> 00:52:33,900
The whole machine goes off, you don’t know why,

968
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:36,270
if you ask them, “What’s the …?” “Oh! I have to go to the airport.”

969
00:52:36,471 --> 00:52:39,541
So what? Even the name of the airport can put people like that.

970
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:43,221
So they become absolutely uneasy people,

971
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:47,661
and this kind of thing when happens, you see, you are in for trouble

972
00:52:47,862 --> 00:52:49,657
you are very much in for trouble.

973
00:52:49,864 --> 00:52:52,282
And this is to be balanced and put right

974
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:55,044
through your Kundalini awakening.

975
00:52:55,701 --> 00:52:58,380
Now this center as you know, is the most important center

976
00:52:58,582 --> 00:53:02,100
because this is the gate to the Kingdom of God,

977
00:53:02,301 --> 00:53:05,259
and is governed by our Lord Jesus Christ,

978
00:53:05,461 --> 00:53:07,900
who is the embodiment of innocence.

979
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:12,237
Here He does not incarnate, there He incarnates on this earth.

980
00:53:12,438 --> 00:53:16,969
Now, His crucifixion was fixed, and He was to be crucified

981
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:21,954
to show that He is eternal life, which does not die.

982
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:25,380
He is Chaitanya; He is made of all these vibrations.

983
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:27,781
So He could walk on the water also,

984
00:53:28,021 --> 00:53:32,822
and He could pass through that tight closeness

985
00:53:33,036 --> 00:53:38,300
of these two balloon-like structures, ego and superego,

986
00:53:38,501 --> 00:53:42,261
and could settle there to establish that center for us,

987
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:44,501
which is called as the Agnya chakra,

988
00:53:44,741 --> 00:53:47,420
which controls your ego and superego, both.

989
00:53:47,661 --> 00:53:52,341
But most surprising, the people who are, say, Catholics

990
00:53:52,581 --> 00:53:55,781
are the people who use their superego.

991
00:53:56,021 --> 00:53:59,141
They get conditioned very much, this should not be done,

992
00:53:59,381 --> 00:54:03,861
confessions, weeping, crying, unhappy...

993
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,580
"We have to be miserable"… Why?

994
00:54:05,781 --> 00:54:09,540
Christ has been crucified for you. He has suffered for you.

995
00:54:09,741 --> 00:54:12,581
Why? If you have accepted Christ, you should be joyous.

996
00:54:12,821 --> 00:54:14,292
Only to be awakened Christ,

997
00:54:14,475 --> 00:54:17,873
so that you get your Realization, that’s all. What is there to cry?

998
00:54:18,074 --> 00:54:20,900
If they are, say Protestants and all that...

999
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,980
I took My birth in Protestant religion,

1000
00:54:23,181 --> 00:54:24,941
and many Hindus and Muslims ask Me,

1001
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:27,900
“Mother, why did You take Your birth in Protestant religion?”

1002
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,900
So I said, “They are very sophisticated fanatics,

1003
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,900
because they rationalize everything.

1004
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,900
They rationalize God, they rationalize every dogma, everything

1005
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,900
it’s such a thinking going on there,

1006
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,380
So it is very difficult to push them back,

1007
00:54:40,621 --> 00:54:43,780
that God is not thinking, God is beyond thought,

1008
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:46,461
God is beyond your mind. Mind is limited.

1009
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:48,105
You have to go beyond that,

1010
00:54:48,306 --> 00:54:51,420
and that’s why Christ crossed that limit by His resurrection.

1011
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:54,092
So His message is His resurrection

1012
00:54:54,266 --> 00:54:58,521
and His resurrection has given us a special quality,

1013
00:54:58,722 --> 00:55:00,518
that once He is awakened within us,

1014
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:03,781
the both these ego and superego are sucked in by Him.

1015
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:05,941
That means He died for our sins,

1016
00:55:06,141 --> 00:55:08,581
so that He sucked our sins, our karmas,

1017
00:55:08,821 --> 00:55:10,996
everything sucked in and this opens out.

1018
00:55:11,197 --> 00:55:14,141
Once this opens out, the Kundalini comes out.

1019
00:55:14,342 --> 00:55:16,900
And this is what He has done such a great work

1020
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,661
that He has died for our sins

1021
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:21,351
and when He is awakened,

1022
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:25,035
both these institutions are sucked in,

1023
00:55:25,236 --> 00:55:27,101
and you become

1024
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:31,061
egoless, superegoless,

1025
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,900
you become de-conditioned automatically.

1026
00:55:34,101 --> 00:55:38,100
Now this great incarnation was called as Mahavishnu

1027
00:55:38,341 --> 00:55:40,900
and is described in the ancient books

1028
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,339
about fourteen thousand years back, by Markandeya.

1029
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,900
But people could not relate it to that,

1030
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,900
because when Christians went from here,

1031
00:55:49,101 --> 00:55:51,604
they went in a different mode, it was a political stunt.

1032
00:55:51,805 --> 00:55:54,899
You see, they carried a gun in one hand and a Bible in another hand.

1033
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,014
Such people could not communicate with other people,

1034
00:55:58,216 --> 00:55:59,857
who had everything with them,

1035
00:56:00,058 --> 00:56:03,261
and they never read those books to them, it was all prohibited.

1036
00:56:03,501 --> 00:56:07,661
Bible is too small a book to contain a character like Christ.

1037
00:56:08,141 --> 00:56:09,637
He was too great a man,

1038
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:11,899
and we should have gone all out to see

1039
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,141
what He’s described in other scriptures,

1040
00:56:14,421 --> 00:56:16,261
how He’s talked about, let us find out.

1041
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:18,261
We should have been open minded about it.

1042
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:20,901
Instead of that people just laughed

1043
00:56:21,101 --> 00:56:24,466
and mocked at all these old books, the Scriptures,

1044
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:26,188
and they thought they are the wisest.

1045
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:29,821
This is the worst part is that the ego thinks they are the highest,

1046
00:56:30,061 --> 00:56:32,021
they are the best, they can do what they like

1047
00:56:32,221 --> 00:56:33,661
and that is how they lived.

1048
00:56:33,901 --> 00:56:36,861
But thank God, now, people are realizing

1049
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,420
that we have missed the point, we have definitely missed the point.

1050
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:42,894
So we have to see what He was

1051
00:56:43,095 --> 00:56:46,061
before He came on this earth,

1052
00:56:46,261 --> 00:56:50,900
in the Heaven, how He was created, how He was Alpha and Omega,

1053
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:54,500
what was His own nature, for what purpose He came,

1054
00:56:54,741 --> 00:56:57,661
and why He died, why He was resurrected,

1055
00:56:57,901 --> 00:57:00,140
why this drama was to be carried out?

1056
00:57:00,341 --> 00:57:04,341
For this, only three and a half years of Christ cannot explain,

1057
00:57:04,581 --> 00:57:08,021
and people cannot tell us why all these things happened.

1058
00:57:08,221 --> 00:57:10,900
We have to keep a very open mind about Christ,

1059
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,460
and we have to see with our own eyes how it works out.

1060
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:16,900
In Kundalini awakening you’ll be surprised,

1061
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,900
when the Kundalini stops here,

1062
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,967
and this chakra is closed,

1063
00:57:21,168 --> 00:57:25,100
then you have to say the Lord’s prayer, everywhere,

1064
00:57:25,461 --> 00:57:27,461
whether you are a Jew, you are a Muslim,

1065
00:57:27,701 --> 00:57:29,821
you are a Hindu or a Christian.

1066
00:57:30,061 --> 00:57:32,900
From whatever community you become a yogi,

1067
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:36,460
you become a realized soul, you have to say the Lord’s Prayer,

1068
00:57:36,741 --> 00:57:38,212
because the Kundalini won’t rise,

1069
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:43,061
and that is the one of the greatest proof

1070
00:57:43,261 --> 00:57:44,980
that Christ resides here.

1071
00:57:45,181 --> 00:57:48,501
If you do not say the Lord’s Prayer, it doesn’t work out.

1072
00:57:48,741 --> 00:57:50,940
So Lord’s Prayer is a mantra, is a chanting,

1073
00:57:51,141 --> 00:57:53,417
but is to be said by a person who is a realized soul,

1074
00:57:53,618 --> 00:57:54,980
who is authorized for you.

1075
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:57,181
Otherwise it is called as anadhikar cheshta,

1076
00:57:57,421 --> 00:57:59,260
means the person who has no right,

1077
00:57:59,461 --> 00:58:02,021
is trying to do something, is doing a wrong thing.

1078
00:58:02,221 --> 00:58:05,100
So those who are realized souls, when they say

1079
00:58:05,341 --> 00:58:08,900
this mantra, then this center is opened up,

1080
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,500
Christ is awakened, and you are allowed

1081
00:58:11,737 --> 00:58:14,682
to see, allow your Kundalini to pass through it

1082
00:58:14,883 --> 00:58:18,900
and enter into the realm of this limbic area

1083
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:26,100
where is one thousand petaled Lotus remains.

1084
00:58:26,595 --> 00:58:29,461
Now these petals then open up,

1085
00:58:29,741 --> 00:58:32,900
because of the pressure being reduced

1086
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,770
of the ego and super ego,

1087
00:58:34,971 --> 00:58:40,021
and they are in different beautiful colored flames.

1088
00:58:40,295 --> 00:58:43,981
The outside starts with a just like

1089
00:58:44,181 --> 00:58:47,085
from vibgyor if you take it, from

1090
00:58:47,301 --> 00:58:51,380
Vibgyor in the same way they start, but very slowly moving

1091
00:58:51,621 --> 00:58:54,394
and the end ones are like crystal, crystal,

1092
00:58:54,595 --> 00:58:56,541
absolutely like crystal, they’re shinning.

1093
00:58:56,781 --> 00:58:58,860
And when the Kundalini comes out of it

1094
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,621
you see the whole thing opened out, the whole chakra opens out.

1095
00:59:02,861 --> 00:59:07,181
This is a very important center which has to be opened out

1096
00:59:07,421 --> 00:59:10,141
because here all the seven centers are there.

1097
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:12,970
For example, we have got here at the back,

1098
00:59:13,171 --> 00:59:16,755
if you start here, from here if you start, is the Mooladhara,

1099
00:59:16,956 --> 00:59:19,466
and then around it is the Swadisthana,

1100
00:59:19,641 --> 00:59:22,866
and here is the Nabhi, and then it is the Heart.

1101
00:59:23,067 --> 00:59:26,411
See now. This is the hole which has to open,

1102
00:59:26,612 --> 00:59:27,957
and this is the Heart,

1103
00:59:28,158 --> 00:59:31,900
means if there is a dirty heart,

1104
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:35,100
if there is a closed heart, if it is a tired heart,

1105
00:59:35,341 --> 00:59:38,819
if there is a sick heart, then this doesn’t open.

1106
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:41,861
So in the heart resides the Spirit,

1107
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,420
and that’s why this is the seat of the Spirit,

1108
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:46,181
but it resides in the heart.

1109
00:59:46,421 --> 00:59:49,541
So when this opens out,

1110
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:54,047
this flower-like lotus opens out,

1111
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:57,181
then the Kundalini rises in Her own glory,

1112
00:59:57,382 --> 00:59:59,821
and you get your Realization, as you got it.

1113
01:00:00,061 --> 01:00:02,981
Now as I told you, it is the beginning.

1114
01:00:03,341 --> 01:00:04,900
In the Bible it is said,

1115
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,900
“I will appear before you like tongues of flames,”

1116
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:10,603
and you can see it. I see it every day,

1117
01:00:10,804 --> 01:00:12,661
the beautiful tongues of flames.

1118
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:15,261
But you can’t see it because you are in it.

1119
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:19,180
Whatever you see, you are not, so you have to first become.

1120
01:00:19,381 --> 01:00:21,981
Once you become and you grow into that,

1121
01:00:22,181 --> 01:00:25,581
then you can also start seeing, but just now you have to become.

1122
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:28,819
Supposing you see the light, means you are not the light.

1123
01:00:29,021 --> 01:00:30,981
If you see anything, you are not that.

1124
01:00:31,181 --> 01:00:36,336
So the question is of becoming, of actualizing and growing into it

1125
01:00:36,537 --> 01:00:39,141
and knowing about everything that you do,

1126
01:00:39,381 --> 01:00:42,221
Everything should be knowledgeable and should be understood,

1127
01:00:42,461 --> 01:00:44,100
should be logical.

1128
01:00:44,421 --> 01:00:47,981
I hope it works out in this place.
I have told you all about chakras.

1129
01:00:48,181 --> 01:00:51,900
Tomorrow what to do after Self Realization I’ll tell you.

1130
01:00:53,035 --> 01:00:55,191
And we'll have another session here in this hall,

1131
01:00:55,392 --> 01:00:56,762
luckily we have got it,

1132
01:00:56,963 --> 01:00:59,531
and we have decided to have one more program tomorrow.

1133
01:00:59,732 --> 01:01:02,581
I hope it will be nice tomorrow and it won’t rain so much.

1134
01:01:02,821 --> 01:01:05,380
So call all your friends. I will tell you what’s to be done

1135
01:01:05,621 --> 01:01:08,177
after Realization, what is the situation.

1136
01:01:08,357 --> 01:01:10,978
So, may God bless you. Thank you.
