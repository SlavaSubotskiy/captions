[Music]

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,829
[Applause]

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:23,790
why all the religions have failed

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:28,259
because they did not get their

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:33,510
self-realization they did not become the

6
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:36,719
spirit so there's a tremendous

7
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,290
difference between you on earth and all

8
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,500
others who profess somebody it looks as

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:47,280
if they're hypocrites they

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:50,999
intellectualize it as you know they

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,210
explain it very well but you can see

12
00:00:50,999 --> 00:01:01,859
very clearly that they haven't absorbed

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:07,520
spirituality that absorption was

14
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:11,370
impossible without self like this

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:15,060
everybody felt good I went to this limit

16
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:20,700
and Mahavira both to say that forget

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:25,890
about God forget about God Almighty you

18
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,840
just get yourself yourself relation so

19
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,920
they are called as atheist any rickshaw

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,920
body they don't believe in Israel but

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,759
they felt that the way people are just

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:45,530
talking about God Almighty and what the

23
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:49,350
books are said these books also speak of

24
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:54,259
righteousness except in some books there

25
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:58,229
has been some sort of interference but

26
00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:03,090
most of them speak of spirituality and

27
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:07,340
what you have to achieve what is the

28
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,340
purpose of religion

29
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:15,060
everybody claims that they are the

30
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:18,880
chosen ones but they are just the same

31
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:22,660
there's a tremendous achievement of

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:27,599
sahaja Yogi's that they have achieved a

33
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:30,880
state of spirit so now you can absorb

34
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:35,590
Dharma without any difficulties without

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,989
any you will stick on to the truth first

36
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:41,860
of all which is the most important thing

37
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:49,630
that you have a rapport with God

38
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:52,870
Almighty that you are in a way in awe

39
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:56,830
about God all your attention will be

40
00:02:52,870 --> 00:03:00,310
towards the expansion of your awareness

41
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:06,069
in the light of the Spirit this is the

42
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:09,549
vision of your mother because she was

43
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:12,250
just a witness so that Shiva is just

44
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:16,540
witnessing all this plane he doesn't

45
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:20,739
have any visions about but now you must

46
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:23,049
have lots of hopes after seeing the kind

47
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:27,480
of people that are created out of

48
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:30,160
certain very unique very beautiful

49
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,790
wonderful angel like people have been

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:38,700
created now only problem is that you

51
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:43,209
have to keep to your angelic foundations

52
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:48,250
but I find that sometimes it happens

53
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:56,319
doesn't matter that you fall and falter

54
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:59,910
again you rise into your awareness and

55
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,910
try to locate

56
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:11,040
the new dimensions that are available to

57
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:17,769
you that you can find out

58
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:20,889
so this speciality that you have got is

59
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:24,040
the region of all the saints of all the

60
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:30,400
prophets of all this years of all the

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:33,610
incarnations is you the heart has become

62
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,610
so large because she was shining there

63
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:39,610
is purity shining it has become such a

64
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,770
large heart that it encompasses the

65
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,470
whole universe I think the way people

66
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:48,700
looking look at it that's why you all

67
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:51,190
have become Universal people but that

68
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,800
universe something you have got thanks

69
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:57,450
to your spirit that was there quite

70
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,000
intact and which has started shining

71
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:03,580
sahaja Yoga is such a subtle subject

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,620
because you know everybody has failed to

73
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:12,130
make people understand anything about

74
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:17,200
impossible situation but this was the

75
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:21,510
trick your spirit once your spirit is

76
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,510
enlightened it goes into your head

77
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,389
without any difficulties absolutely such

78
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:36,389
you don't know how difficult is the

79
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:36,389
subject of such it is such a fulfillment

80
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:47,099
but the desire of the divine that your

81
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:51,300
divinity is now expressive once you have

82
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:53,639
got the spirit you get that power that

83
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,729
you can surpass all the sin temptations

84
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,069
not only temptations also the

85
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:01,469
differentiations that you always make

86
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:07,740
this is that this is that but you

87
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:10,129
integrate integrate among yourselves you

88
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:15,539
integrate among different states

89
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:18,689
integrate among different countries the

90
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:27,830
whole cosmos seems to be integrated

91
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:27,830
woman and governed by the divine laws

92
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:41,360
this integration gives you a complete

93
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:44,360
understanding of sahaja yoga mentally

94
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,360
emotionally

95
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,970
as spiritually

96
00:06:51,020 --> 00:07:01,139
it's not by some sort of brainwashing or

97
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:05,189
body but just through the light of

98
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:08,550
spirit you have seen the truth and you

99
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:12,509
have understood it also you have so many

100
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:19,649
powers you do not want to exert that's a

101
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:23,249
different point or thing but just on one

102
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:26,279
word of Prayer from you it's very

103
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:35,729
powerful than hundreds of prayers of

104
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:39,860
these people one asking is much more

105
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:44,159
powerful then thousands of these asking

106
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:47,610
you have never tried that try that so

107
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:52,110
very powerful in collective and also

108
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:58,050
individually I don't desire it but you

109
00:07:52,110 --> 00:08:00,539
have to decide you have to pray you have

110
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,869
to ask and the wider you become your

111
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:07,439
prayers will be wider for a wider world

112
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:09,959
wider region not limited to your

113
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:16,039
children and not imitate your family not

114
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:18,539
limited to one place but unlimited areas

115
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:24,719
because if we have the power and if we

116
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:28,919
can operate the divine power then why

117
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:30,990
not we work it out ourselves we can so

118
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:39,060
your attention can go to any place it

119
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:41,370
can go to Nicaragua it can go to Israel

120
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,860
it can go to Saddam Hussein to any place

121
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:47,939
that you want to work it out it moves

122
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:53,639
its mobile it's Universal just start

123
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:56,000
expanding your heart your mind and your

124
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,000
attention

125
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:04,210

of Shiva within you that's the most

133
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:36,660
important and look after your vibrations

134
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:44,980
which are Sates in your being because

135
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:49,709
the spirit has awakened in your

136
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:52,209
attention in your central nervous system

137
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:59,350
that's the most important thing you have

138
00:09:52,209 --> 00:10:04,470
to do the rest of it is such the stuff

139
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,470
it is absolutely such may God bless

140
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,470
[Music]

141
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,050
Oh
