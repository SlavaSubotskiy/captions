1
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,440
So now we have talked
about Bhairava and

2
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,320
we have seen how
negativity acts within us,

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,400
and how we get caught up.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,280
So,

5
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,230
I would say that, we must
always keep in mind,

6
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,390
that we have a soul

7
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,150
and that soul can be attacked.

8
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,230
It has been already
attacked when with all

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,420
the kinds of things we have
had in these modern lives,

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,060
it's already under attack.

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,220
But now we have to
cleanse it, and put it right.

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,100
If you really want to enjoy Sahaja
Yoga and cleanse yourself

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,100
then you have to understand
that we need lot of introspection

14
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,290
- lot of introspection.

15
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,290
Now the people who are
left-sided are sort of,

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,250
they are not straightforward

17
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,370
and they are sly and
they talk ill about others.

18
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,130
Last time I discovered that in Perth

19
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,200
there was a lot of things
people were talking and,

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,040
I wanted to remind you again
that I heard about it,

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,400
also that even now in Australia

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,200
that kind of people are still there,

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,190
who just start at the
back saying things.

24
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,150
One person says something,
another listens to it

25
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,110
and it's very very bad thing,

26
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,110
because talking ill about others
means you first of all

27
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,110
you get the ill within you.

28
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,190
The second thing is that
the way you propagate

29
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,260
you stop Divinity spreading out.

30
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,220
Thirdly you grow into
negativity yourself

31
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:50,020
and to whomsoever you talk
that person also gets infected,

32
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,220
it's like a disease.

33
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,220
So I think in Australia throughout
we have to be very careful

34
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,170
because we have had two
big somersaults you can say,

35
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,050
with big falling
because of this only,

36
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,090
that secretly, and this is a side,

37
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,090
I would say Australia
is very left-sided

38
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,080
otherwise also
because Ganesha's place.

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,120
That's why Ganesha
was placed here,

40
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,360
to save you and to put you right

41
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,240
as far as the left side is concerned.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,240
And we have to be very cautious

43
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,200
because that temperament develops,

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,120
you know, depend on.

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,310
Like also it is in England quite a lot,

46
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,150
but say not in America,
say not in Austria,

47
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,270
not in Russia, Germany,

48
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,150
they are on the contrary open
and they can be aggressive,

49
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,350
but they are not sly.

50
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,180
So either you are aggressive
or you are sly.

51
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,020
Accordingly you must
find out within yourself

52
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,060
what's wrong with you
and where are we wrong.

53
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,020
Because after all we
are Sahaja Yogis,

54
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,340
it's a great chance we have got

55
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,180
that we have got our Realization,

56
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,170
and that now we have reached
a stage where we really

57
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,170
are placed in the Kingdom of God.

58
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,330
But now how far you go
into it depends only on you.

59
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,970
Now Russia why we
were successful

60
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,970
because people are
very introspective.

61
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,160
If you read any book
of Russian writers

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,160
like Tolstoy or anyone,

63
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,240
anything they do, say even when
they fall in love or anything,

64
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,240
immediately they
start introspecting:

65
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,280
'Why, why am I falling in love?

66
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,240
Why this happening to me?

67
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,230
Why I'm thinking like that?
Why I'm doing like that?'

68
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,070
You see they introspect,

69
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,190
and that introspection if we
do not have within ourselves

70
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,110
then, what happens that we can go

71
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,150
either to the right or to the left.

72
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,220
But in this country I see
it's more the left side,

73
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,220
sly things are there.

74
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,020
Now how all this
has happened that

75
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,260
we had some horrible leaders,

76
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,180
agreed and instead
of talking about it

77
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,210
or telling Me about it,

78
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,930
they all just started talking
among themselves and all that

79
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,130
and they got all their bad qualities

80
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,170
sort of combined within themselves

81
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,210
and that's how so many
lost their vibrations

82
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,290
and lost their, what should I say,

83
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,040
the searching power.

84
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,000
So when you see a person,

85
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,240
or anyone who is doing wrong,

86
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,120
better is to forget about it.

87
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,950
Or if you don't forget then
you should write to Me,

88
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,950
even if you don't do that

89
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,950
better go and talk to
that person on his face

90
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,950
that: 'I think this is not right.'

91
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,270
But if you write to
Me it can be solved,

92
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,070
problem can be solved.

93
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,940
Say now you have one
Mr X as your leader

94
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,060
or anybody here who is

95
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,900
coming say,

96
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,020
from New Zealand,

97
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,980
or someone from outside.

98
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,220
Immediately you should find out,

99
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,900
are you critical of him?

100
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,210
What are you looking at that person?

101
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,010
What are you trying to find
out about that person?

102
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,010
If you are critical then know
that you can never progress.

103
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,050
You should be critical
about yourself,

104
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,960
not about others,

105
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,040
know that you
are most imperfect,

106
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,200
that's the best way.

107
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,160
Like we had a child
about nine year old,

108
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,240
and he was extremely sly type

109
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,120
and,

110
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,030
he was talking ill like this of
this person to that person and

111
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,150
he would go and just
jump on to someone,

112
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,990
and hit someone, secretly.

113
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,110
Not openly.

114
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,190
So I called the child
and I asked him:

115
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,990
'What do you think of yourself?

116
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,100
Do you think you are the
most perfect person?'

117
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,180
He said: 'Yes, I do'

118
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,980
I said: 'That's it.

119
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,020
It's finished.'

120
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,060
Such a person cannot improve.

121
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,860
So when you try to find
faults with others

122
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,210
know that we have too
many faults ourselves.

123
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,010
Not to feel guilty - of course,
that point is there also.

124
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,010
you should never feel
guilty about it.

125
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,090
If you have faults just see:

126
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,890
"What faults do I have?

127
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,050
How will I correct?

128
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,890
What chakras I am catching?"

129
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,160
Instead of seeing the
chakras of others,

130
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,080
if you see your own, then
you'll become purified,

131
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,960
you'll be very clean, you'll be wonderful,

132
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,880
everything will be fine.

133
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,920
But if you cannot see
your own faults,

134
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,190
that means you haven't
yet got your Self-Realization.

135
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,990
Self-Realization means to
know about your Self,

136
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,190
and this - the last time I did
say all these things here in Perth

137
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,070
and also otherwise, that if you

138
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,140
talk about somebody like
that to spread stories.

139
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,220
Ladies specially should be careful

140
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,900
because they are on the left,

141
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,820
they have to be very, very careful,

142
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,820
that they start judging others.

143
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
They think they are
perfect, they judge,

144
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,820
they tell their husbands,

145
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,060
then husband tells another husband,

146
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,980
then husband tells his
wife - it spreads.

147
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,130
You have to be extremely
wise and sensible women.

148
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,850
If you are not sensible
this will spread like a disease.

149
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,810
In Sahaja Yoga this is one
of the diseases I dread,

150
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,960
is what Christ has
called: "Murmuring souls."

151
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,000
He said: "Beware of
the murmuring souls!"

152
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,000
Leaders are also afraid
to tell you something.

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
If they tell you something
immediately you'll start saying

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,080
"Oh, Mother said so
- he's saying so."

155
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,990
Whatever the leader is
saying you must listen to him,

156
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,030
must obey him, ask him

157
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,830
what, does he mean by
saying this, what is it?

158
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,070
Now in case you find something
wrong with the leader

159
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,950
you are all free to write to Me,

160
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,830
and I will definitely go into it,

161
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,870
for example, Stephen wrote
to Me about someone

162
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,780
and I went into this,

163
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,900
enquired and found out
what was the thing.

164
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,860
You see so there's no harm,

165
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,020
in finding out about someone.

166
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,060
Some lady wrote to Me
also and I found it.

167
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,930
So but unnecessarily paying
attention to another person

168
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,770
is not a good thing.

169
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,010
Paying attention to yourself

170
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,010
and looking all the good
points of another person,

171
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,890
of helping another person,

172
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,930
that's how we would be collective,

173
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,850
we'll be growing faster

174
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,770
and we'll be enjoying ourselves.

175
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,760
Now our children are here.

176
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Now, what I find that
we do not know really

177
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,960
what are the balanced ways
of looking after our children.

178
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,040
So some think that when
I said they are realized souls,

179
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,790
so they said, "All right, let
them do what they like."

180
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,870
It's not true,
otherwise if that is so

181
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,870
they would have been born
out of the trees, you see.

182
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,790
Why are they born out of you?

183
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,030
So you have a responsibility

184
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,110
whether they are realized or not.

185
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,100
You have a responsibility
about your children

186
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,940
and you have to see
that you correct them.

187
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,820
It's very important.

188
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,740
Some people I've seen
allow their children

189
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,980
to go just so mad and
so, they go so amok.

190
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,930
In this I would say an Indian
parent is an ideal parent.

191
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,850
What he will do, he
looks after the child.

192
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,890
Also, in a way he loves,

193
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,810
expresses his love and all that,

194
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,080
but if he finds anything
wrong with the child

195
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,880
immediately he'll
correct - immediately,

196
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,800
not spare him, in the
presence of others.

197
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,080
Now, if another person comes
and tells about the child,

198
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
that this child has done,

199
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,830
immediately he will scold the child.

200
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,830
He will never get angry with
the another person:

201
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,790
"Why did you say
about my child now?"

202
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,950
But thank him and that
"Thank God you have told me";

203
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,950
because he might be spoiled more.

204
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,070
Like I'll tell you we had one Avadhut

205
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,060
- now he's a grown up boy,
but when he was young,

206
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,020
one day he asked Me that,

207
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,820
"If you leave your parents their,

208
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,860
the baddhas of your parents
they leave you or not?"

209
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,820
I said: 'No, they may not leave,
the baddhas of your parents.

210
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,900
Then what's the use
of leaving the parents?'

211
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,730
"But," I said:
'Who is leaving parents?"

212
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,730
"No," he said: "I've heard that
in the Western countries,

213
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,930
people, children
leave their parents

214
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,810
when they are
eighteen years of age.

215
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,890
But I would not
like to leave the parents."

216
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,770
I said: "Why?
You can be free."

217
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,960
He said: "Then, I'll be
free to do wrong.

218
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,880
Who will correct me?

219
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,840
If I take the cigarette
in my hand,

220
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,000
who will correct me?

221
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,800
Who will tell me:
"Don't do it."

222
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,040
I mean if a child takes
a cigarette in the hand,

223
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,000
immediately the father
will take the cigarette

224
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
and burn it, also.

225
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,950
And: "Next time I see you
I'll burn your tongue."

226
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,670
Finished.

227
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,710
But, the child knows that,
"The father loves me

228
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,710
and loves me in such a way

229
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,750
that I should not lose my father",

230
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,700
but he must know that he can lose,

231
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,700
the kindness of the father.

232
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,700
If you allow the child
just all the time

233
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,820
to behave the way
he likes, or it likes,

234
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,980
then it will sit on your head.

235
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,820
And today only I was
discussing with him

236
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,850
and I told him that I was
traveling one day with one lady

237
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,690
in the train, one of
the Sahaja Yoginis,

238
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,850
and her child was
there, not very old,

239
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,970
must have been about
seven years of age.

240
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,770
She was trying to talk
to Me and this fellow

241
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,000
was all the time:
"Mummy, mummy,"

242
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,720
and then: "Why? Why?"
was going on,

243
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,920
you see, all the time.

244
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,920
I told her: "Why must you
answer all his questions?"

245
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
I said: "He is just
making enquiries."

246
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,910
I said, "Nothing sensible
enquiries, just it's nonsense.

247
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,870
He wants to attract
your attention."

248
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,710
So why do you want to pay
so much attention to him?

249
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,830
So she said: "Mother, how to stop it?"

250
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,750
I said: "I'll stop it in one minute."

251
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,950
I said, I asked him:

252
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,950
"You should not ask
so many questions."

253
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,900
So he said: "Why?"

254
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,740
"Because", I said,
"you are stupid.

255
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,980
You have to learn a lot, still

256
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,940
and if you go on asking
question like this

257
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,740
you'll be very, very stupid

258
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,660
and one day you'll have
to go like a madman.

259
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,940
Do you want to become a madman?"

260
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,810
He got a fright of his life.

261
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,850
"You'll become mad."

262
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,690
And you see if you any
of your children are there

263
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,730
you have to tell them
some stories. I'll tell you how.

264
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,730
Some children have
a habit of beating others

265
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,650
or doing something, then you said,

266
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:15,680
"Now if you beat then a tail
comes out of your bottom,

267
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,920
like that you see like a doggy
and something like that."

268
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,600
And they believe it.
They believe it.

269
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,920
Next day they'll ask:
"Is there a tail coming out?"

270
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,790
"Ya maybe, maybe."

271
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,670
So now you are going to
behave: "Ya I'll be very..."

272
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,630
You see all these tricks have
to be played to your children

273
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,790
but they're very clever

274
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,830
and they knowhow
to make you dance,

275
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,830
you see how to make you

276
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,780
- their sort of slaves,
sometimes, you may call

277
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,580
for everything they
will demand: "Do this, do this."

278
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,580
Now because they're Realized souls

279
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,620
I was surprised that when
I went to London you see

280
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,770
I read in the newspaper
the statistics about children

281
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,890
that every week in London City only,

282
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,930
two children are killed by parents.

283
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,850
I mean that was too much for Me.

284
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,730
So I just blasted all
of them and I said:

285
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,690
"Nothing doing, you must
love your children."

286
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,720
As a result all the children
sat on their heads, you see

287
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,840
and they couldn't come
to the programs.

288
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,800
If they came to the
programs they were,

289
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,560
the children were to be
kept outside like doggies,

290
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,880
tied together something and
in England I don't know,

291
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,880
maybe here also, they do
have a leash, just like a dog.

292
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,750
You see they hold the
children just like... I said,

293
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,670
"How cruel it is",

294
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,590
but now I know how children
can be in the West.

295
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,710
I don't know if it's white skin
or whatever you may say

296
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,790
that first we started
a school you see, for them,

297
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,630
because there was
no school available,

298
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,780
they were in a mess.

299
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,620
So we said, "All right in Dharamshala
we'll start a school."

300
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,820
So we started
a school in Dharamshala

301
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,780
and these children were brought

302
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,900
because they had no way
to go anywhere

303
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,900
so in a hurry it was
started, you see.

304
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,690
So there must be something
also if you

305
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,690
just start a school in a great hurry

306
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,610
maybe some things are left out.

307
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,570
But these children were terrible

308
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,690
because they saw these
teachers were Indians

309
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,770
so they came and
started punching them,

310
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,530
they started showing
tongue to them,

311
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,810
sometimes spitting
at them, sometimes

312
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,720
- pinching and doing all
kinds of things, you know.

313
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,640
So the teachers got a fright.

314
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,520
They said: "Baba, we can't
look after these bounders,

315
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,880
God knows what they are up to.

316
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,800
One day they'll bring a knife
and push it through us.

317
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,750
We don't know what to do."

318
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,550
And we have very bad
experience in Shudy Camp

319
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,790
about these children

320
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,630
that they had no sense
of proportion, nothing.

321
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,790
They were not cautious at all and

322
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,670
then I said: 'What will you do?

323
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,700
"They have already started jumping,"

324
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,580
they said, "from different places."

325
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,660
I hope they are not
jumping there.

326
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,700
So... and one boy broke his leg.

327
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,580
They got a fright.

328
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,850
So I said: 'All right now
you do one thing.

329
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,690
They are already spoilt

330
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,730
but take one foot-rule, ruler,

331
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,650
and keep it and say that

332
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,690
"If you misbehave this is the thing."

333
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,770
And once or twice just do
a little bit like that."

334
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,680
Now that doesn't mean you
go on beating your children.

335
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,480
I mean everything should
not be taken to an extreme,

336
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,840
but there should be a balance.

337
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,600
Must understand.

338
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,720
So there was one boy
who had come as a cook

339
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,720
from Austria and Yogi had asked him,

340
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,590
he thought that he is a Westerner -

341
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,830
"You'd better look after the children."

342
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,510
He started thrashing
them, left and right.

343
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,670
Not the Indian women.

344
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,550
Indian women don't
thrash so much,

345
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,510
you see we don't
beat. I mean I have

346
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,550
slapped My daughter
once, one daughter,

347
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,580
elder one and younger
one twice in their lifetime.

348
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,540
We don't believe in thrashing,

349
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,660
but you see they're
afraid of our eyes,

350
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,700
even they know what
we want, what is good.

351
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,490
I'll tell you My younger
daughter she,

352
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,730
when she went to college
in Delhi she found

353
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,490
all the girls were wearing
sleeveless blouses.

354
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,690
So she came and asked Me,

355
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,570
Should I wear sleeveless blouses?

356
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,450
because all the girls are
wearing sleeveless blouses?"

357
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,690
I said, "Go ahead if you think so."

358
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,760
She said, "Mummy why don't
you wear sleeveless blouse?"

359
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,720
I said, "I feel shy when
I've worn it;

360
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,720
I don't like to expose
My hands like that,

361
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,640
I don't like it, it's not good.

362
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,640
The arms, you see, should
be covered, I think."

363
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,510
Immediately she said,

364
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,750
"Then it is no criteria if I say

365
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,790
I want this and all that you
should say yes to everything.

366
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,550
You should have said, 'No,

367
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,510
no', to me. I would have
been very happy."

368
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,710
So this wisdom is there in,
among Indian children.

369
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,700
They like - like Avadut,
as I told you,

370
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
he said that, "Then
who will correct me,

371
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,620
who will stop me
from doing wrong?"

372
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,700
But that's not with
our children here,

373
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,460
so you see because,
I don't know why,

374
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,420
but maybe that our roots
are too deep or whatever it is

375
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,450
we have to keep controlled
all the time

376
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,730
and wisdom is very important.

377
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,530
If you tell a child, "You have
been very unmannerly," -

378
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,650
I mean, it's like saying the
horridest thing to a child,

379
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,770
"you're unmannerly."

380
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,770
Or to say, "You are very unwise";

381
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,490
then the child feels very hurt.

382
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,640
"I'm unwise, I've not been seeing."

383
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,600
But the best thing would be to say,

384
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
"You are Sahaja Yogis,
you are special people,

385
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,760
you can't do like that,
you are Sahaja Yogis."

386
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,440
All the time go on telling them

387
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,480
how dignified they should be,

388
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,430
what is expected of
a Sahaja Yogi, it is better.

389
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,590
But never spoil them.

390
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,550
This is one thing you should
not do otherwise it will be

391
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,470
a permanent headache for you,

392
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,710
even if they are Realized souls
whatever they may be.

393
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,670
But please see that
you do not spoil them.

394
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,470
That's very important.

395
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,500
Also as I told you that,

396
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,540
"Don't talk ill of each
other, on the back."

397
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,460
Is a very bad habit,

398
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,540
that's how you'll catch on bhoots

399
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,660
and you'll become extremely negative.

400
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,580
Any such thought comes into
your mind, just stop it.

401
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,530
It's a very, nasty disease
you see that spreads,

402
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,690
so it makes you - I mean, it's
so sickening you know,

403
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,490
when I mean I hear
about somebody

404
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,610
who talks ill of someone
it's extremely sickening

405
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,680
because it's not being human.

406
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,680
You see in the animal, there's
one animal called hyena.

407
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,480
And they say this
hyena is like that.

408
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,400
It comes slowly and steals
a child, or anything,

409
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,710
it's a very, sly type of an animal

410
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,510
and such a person we call
as hyena in India,

411
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,550
such a person is called as a hyena

412
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:41,470
and it's regarded as a very
low type of a personality,

413
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,540
if they talk like this.

414
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,540
In Sahaja Yoga it doesn't behove.

415
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,700
No Sahaja Yogis should
talk ill about each other.

416
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,500
Nor should they discuss each other.

417
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,420
Never!

418
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,650
Now somebody does that
you must immediately say:

419
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,570
"Now, please I don't want to know.

420
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,370
Please don't tell me."

421
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,610
This is not a very good thing.

422
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,690
Politicians do like that,
but not Sahaja Yogis.

423
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,440
Sahaja Yogis should not do,

424
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,480
because, you see you are
great people, you are yogis.

425
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,640
Do you know how a yogi becomes

426
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,640
a Realized soul, in the normal way?

427
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,440
The other day I was reading a book

428
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,470
about Upanishadas and
one of them was - today

429
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,470
only I saw it in the morning
time when I got up.

430
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,310
There was written about a yogi

431
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,470
that,

432
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,420
"You have to really starve
yourself, first of all.

433
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,340
Then you have to do shirshasana,

434
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,540
with that you have to do pranayama,

435
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,380
then you have to get up four
o'clock in the morning

436
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,420
and take your bath,

437
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,540
and then sit down for dhyana,

438
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,530
and for five hours you must
sit for your dhyana.

439
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,330
After that you have
to do pranayama.

440
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,530
That's also special style.

441
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,610
It's not easy for normal
person to do that

442
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,290
is till you say sixty you
raise your left side,

443
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,280
take the prana through your,

444
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,280
I mean you breathe through
your nostril left one,

445
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,440
now sixty-four you
say keep it here,

446
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,430
and then rechaka: you do the
taking it out thirty-two  times,

447
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,630
can you imagine?

448
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,430
This you have to do 108 times,
every day,

449
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,350
minimum. This is the minimum."

450
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,430
Now there are so many exercises,

451
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,470
if I tell you that, you'll
be shocked.

452
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,630
So like,

453
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,620
you have to stand
and suddenly jump

454
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,300
and put your both the
feet five feet apart   imagine

455
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,460
Then turn round,

456
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,540
to clear your nadis you see,

457
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,450
you have to turn round

458
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,370
and put yourself on the left side.

459
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,410
Now on the left side you put yourself

460
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,490
and it's quite a big thing
that they have described

461
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,530
but in short it's
a stretching exercise,

462
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,330
and you put your
hand on the left side

463
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,370
and go down stretch yourself,

464
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,480
again go back to normal,

465
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,280
again jump and go five feet apart.

466
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,240
Then put to the right side.

467
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,280
Nadi cleansing is this way.

468
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,280
But there are so many
others described you see.

469
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,440
They are so horrible.

470
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,440
They said ordinary exercises
for ordinary people,

471
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,230
but for a person who
wants to achieve yoga,

472
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,510
he has to do all these
horrible exercises

473
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,350
are I don't know, I mean,

474
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,390
by that time all your
body will be broken

475
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,230
the way it is or in any case
you'll get moksha you see.

476
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,500
It's like that.

477
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
But what I'm trying
to tell you is this

478
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,540
that now you've got everything simple

479
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,380
- easy this thing, but in
a subtle way

480
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,300
still all these nonsensical
things are sticking on,

481
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,290
and even if you are in the boat now,

482
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,410
still it is there and they are
creating a heavy weight,

483
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,410
and this heavy weight can really

484
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,490
take you down again,

485
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,410
and when you go down
after a certain height,

486
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,410
you go down very fast.

487
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,440
So many people we have
thrown out of Sahaja Yoga,

488
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,560
so many have gone out of Sahaja Yoga,

489
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
so many have come into Sahaja Yoga.

490
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,280
Now the people who have
come in the beginning,

491
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,320
are excused for some time

492
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,520
and also they see you
how you behave,

493
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,350
it's very important.

494
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,430
So first thing we must
know that we are people

495
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,550
who are Sahaja Yogis
special type of people,

496
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,430
specially placed

497
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,310
and we have so many privileges

498
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,510
so we have to be extremely dignified.

499
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,220
I've seen people just will
laugh for nothing at all.

500
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,260
In a group, you are there,

501
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,180
they just start laughing.

502
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,260
There's no need to laugh

503
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,500
but they'll just start laughing.

504
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,300
Even if I am sitting they'll
just go on chatting

505
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,220
and talking and, see no sense at all.

506
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,250
But if your Guru is sitting there
you have to keep quiet,

507
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,490
you have to be humble,

508
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,450
you have to have awe.

509
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,410
All these things are important

510
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,370
which we have to gradually learn,

511
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,490
because you have never had a proper

512
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,200
training about spiritual life.

513
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,200
You see what these churches
or you can say

514
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,240
these temples that you have seen or

515
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,400
anything else that you
have got those,

516
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,200
you see have not been
real masters to tell you

517
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,520
how to behave, how to address,

518
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,230
how to be there.

519
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,390
So, now, gradually you
should see for yourself

520
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,230
that you have to grow,
and grow very fast

521
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,150
and for that you have to remember

522
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,310
we must need our introspection,
to see: 'Where am I?

523
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,460
Now what am I doing?

524
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,220
Ah, now the anger is coming.'

525
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,460
As soon as the anger starts coming

526
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,300
go and stand before
your mirror and say:

527
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,140
'Now come along let's get angry.'

528
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,260
You face yourself all the
time and it will help.

529
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,490
Not the others.

530
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,290
Now I have to tell you that
whenever you find

531
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,370
such people coming up
they will form a group,

532
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,130
then a group can become
bigger or absolutely small,

533
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,370
depending on you.

534
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,410
You have to just say:

535
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,280
'Mother has said not to listen
a word against anyone.

536
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,480
Just not to listen.

537
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,280
And in the beginning of course it is,

538
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,120
quite a lot has to be tolerated.

539
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,400
Like I've seen if you see
the letters written to Me

540
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,120
in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

541
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,270
they are so maddening.

542
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,310
This person talking ill about that,

543
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,150
that person talking ill about that,

544
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,310
I mean, anybody would
be mad to read all that.

545
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,110
So I never read them.

546
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,350
All these letters I used to just burn away.

547
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:44,100
But luckily now these
people have become

548
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,220
extremely sensible,

549
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,100
they understand their responsibility,

550
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,260
they have become very,
very beautiful people,

551
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,100
very understanding,

552
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,260
and the love that they
have for each other,

553
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,100
it's very interesting.

554
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,300
Only in love you can know
about others, not in hatred.

555
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,090
If you hate someone how will
you know about that person,

556
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,330
the beauty of that person?

557
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,130
So then you start seeing
the beauty of that person

558
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,130
and you start enjoying that person.

559
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,130
This is what Sahaja Yoga is.

560
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,450
So I would like you to see
that you train your children

561
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,240
in such a manner that they
feel their responsibilities

562
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,120
as Sahaja Yogis.

563
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,160
May God bless you!

564
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,910
Better be on the lookout,
there’s smaller children also.
