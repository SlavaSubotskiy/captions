1
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,220
Today, we are all here assembled

2
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,220
in Turkey, in Istanbul,

3
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,060
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ

4
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:11,700
and, with that also, your celebration of your resurrection.

5
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,820
Christ's resurrection was a great message for us.

6
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,420
He won over the death

7
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:31,820
and came out of that dead body

8
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,220
with another body which was living body.

9
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,940
The body was the same, but one was a dead body

10
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,180
and another one was a body which was living.

11
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,380
It's not only symbolic, it actually happened within.

12
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:02,860
After all, He was a divine child, He was a divine person.

13
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,060
Actually it has happened within. It's not just a symbolic thing

14
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:15,580
that He died and He was resurrected into another person

15
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,060
or, you can say, into a living person.

16
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,820
For Him, what is the death? For eternal beings, there are no deaths.

17
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,740
There's no death for a person who's eternal.

18
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,980
He may, for the time being, look as if He is dead,

19
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,740
but He can never die.

20
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,860
Christ was like that, a very, very special incarnation,

21
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,820
which came on this earth to be reborn out of the dead.

22
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,140
Now we are also, when we are not yet realized souls,

23
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,460
when we are not yet enlightened.

24
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:13,300
We are also dead in the sense, our awareness is very, very...

25
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,980
I should say, absolutely dull and dead.

26
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,980
We can see flowers, we can see faces, we can see buildings,

27
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,060
we can see cities, we can see all those things.

28
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,260
All these things we see and we feel we are quite aware,

29
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,020
which we are not.

30
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,900
Actual awareness comes to us

31
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,260
when we cross the limits of our mind,

32
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,900
go beyond the mind, and this was only possible

33
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,540
because of the resurrection of Christ.

34
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,140
He resurrected Himself because He was a divine person.

35
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:05,460
But also we are resurrected because we are blessed by Divinity.

36
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,940
Now this mind of ours, which is in between,

37
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:17,620
is controlled by Shri Jesus Christ.

38
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,660
He controls through your Agnya, both the sides.

39
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,460
He controls your conditionings and He controls your ego

40
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,260
and brings a balance in you.

41
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:38,140
But when this Agnya Chakra starts sprinkling,

42
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,020
all sorts of ideas, sometimes reacting,

43
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,300
sometimes accepting conditionings...

44
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,420
it is a slave, it is not a free thing,

45
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,820
because it is working under the influence of your ego

46
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,060
or your superego.

47
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:07,140
For that is the death of our awareness,

48
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,820
that we cannot, we cannot understand something beyond.

49
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:19,420
That there exists a life beyond this, we cannot accept.

50
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,900
This is... We have seen now

51
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:29,740
that we were all in a condition that one was deadened.

52
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,380
We were feeling bad, we were feeling anxious,

53
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,260
we were fighting and we were thinking:

54
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,660
"There's something wrong with our present life."

55
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,380
There's something definitely which makes us slave,

56
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,140
by which we are slavish.

57
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,220
That we realized, no doubt, and we started seeking the Truth.

58
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,860
We started seeking the Truth in so many ways,

59
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,620
I know so many were... also went astray,

60
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:12,340
and they lost their balance and have fallen into a complete demise.

61
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,220
But so many of you have been salvaged,

62
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:23,540
have been saved by the great example of Christ's resurrection.

63
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,220
He had to venture it,

64
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,100
He had to do it and He worked it out.

65
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,340
Without Him, our Agnya would not have been that flexible.

66
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,900
As it is, the human beings

67
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,900
in the olden times were conditioned very much.

68
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,340
And when they have become modern, they are full of ego,

69
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,180
nothing in between.

70
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,900
With these two influences, we are imprisoned,

71
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,180
we are absolutely dead people.

72
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,500
We have no sensitivity for anything.

73
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,340
I've seen now... even today, you can see

74
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,860
about things are happening across,

75
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:12,100
is people are very anxious to kill each other.

76
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,700
Human beings want to kill human beings, can you imagine?

77
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:22,100
Such a stupid thing that we should kill our kith and kin.

78
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,540
Then, there are children who are killing,

79
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,740
parents that are killing, no relationship is accepted.

80
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:36,900
It's a sign of a person whose awareness is completely dead.

81
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,940
In our awareness, at least

82
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,420
we should have feelings of compassion and love.

83
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,900
But that one is lost, it's not there, we don't have it.

84
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,020
The whole world is a flame, when you read about

85
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,220
all the wars that are going on,

86
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,300
the way they are killing children,

87
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,700
the way they are destroying human beings.

88
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,660
It is a wrong attitude

89
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,140
that with discretion of human beings, things will improve.

90
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,940
It's a very, very wrong concept

91
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,220
that by destroying them, one can achieve something.

92
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,820
Our work in Sahaja Yoga is doing well, I must say,

93
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,020
but it has to stop this horrible attitude of human beings

94
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,180
to destroy.

95
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,900
So you might ask then: "What to do, Mother?

96
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,460
What to do to stop this destruction?"

97
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,940
Answer is in the life of Christ.

98
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,020
You resurrect people,

99
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,460
you resurrect them, enlighten them, bring them

100
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,460
to a state where they understand what is right and what is wrong.

101
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,980
Let them feel, let them feel the compassion

102
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,780
and love that is within you.

103
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,900
When that starts, that third force within us starts acting,

104
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,820
our ego also comes down,

105
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,860
our conditionings also come down.

106
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,620
For example, if you think: "We are Muslims,

107
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,020
we have a right to kill others", if you think:

108
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,180
"We are Jews, we have a right to kill others."

109
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,300
All these differentiations and

110
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,140
this kind of discrimination that we have is so stupid,

111
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,740
because you are human beings,

112
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,660
they are human beings.

113
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:46,060
You are killing human beings!

114
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,660
Not that they have committed any sin

115
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,740
or they have done anything wrong,

116
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,820
except that, in their foolishness, they believe that

117
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,980
they are this and they are that.

118
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,500
You are not! You are just human beings.

119
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,500
In every human being, as you know very well, there is Kundalini.

120
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,100
There's no discrimination, everyone,

121
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,180
whether you are a Muslim, a Jew, Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Parsee,

122
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,260
anyone, you may call by any name.

123
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:25,700
Now just look at how we accept a certain denomination for ourselves!

124
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,460
You are born, say, to a Christian family

125
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,740
or you are born to a Hindu family:

126
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,340
immediately you start thinking you are there to uphold

127
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:45,100
all the flags of that religion in which you are born.

128
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,020
You are born in that religion without your knowledge,

129
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,100
without your permission, without any understanding.

130
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,540
So how can you belong to that religion?

131
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,580
You have got Kundalini, everybody else has got Kundalini.

132
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,460
So you can only belong to the religion of humanity,

133
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,420
where every human being has got Kundalini.

134
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,660
So, you are nothing but human beings.

135
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,860
All these false ideas, that:

136
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,580
"We are Hindus, we are Muslims, we are Christians",

137
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,980
is all man-created. I mean, man can create anything,

138
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,700
and human beings have no brain to understand

139
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,780
that is all man creating.

140
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,460
For example, you see in America,

141
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,420
they create associations and big organizations and all that,

142
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:43,380
based on absolute falsehood, absolute wrong ideas,

143
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,660
absolute destructiveness, but they form it,

144
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,540
they form their groups, they have this, they have...

145
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,340
and they are prospering.

146
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,540
But it has a repercussion, they don't know.

147
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,340
If you start doing such false things against human beings

148
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,300
who are created by God, and nobody can destroy them,

149
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,900
then there are repercussions.

150
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,740
Many, many countries, who were, once upon a time, rulers,

151
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,020
were known as great things, have come down.

152
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,860
And all such countries who now think they are very rich

153
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,860
and all that, will have to come down.

154
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,220
All of them have to come down, is just an ultimate result

155
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,500
of this stupidity to believe that you are higher than others,

156
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,860
that you can kill others.

157
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,820
So, a non-violent method started

158
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,380
which is of another absurdity, I think,

159
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:54,140
because then they start saving mosquitoes and also the bugs,

160
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,100
while mosquitoes and bugs are,

161
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,620
you must know, are the greatest blood-suckers.

162
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,980
They live only on human blood.

163
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,220
Such things, what's the use of saving them?

164
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:17,780
So, human beings take to something that is absurd, stupid, foolish.

165
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,460
I don't know what is the reason.

166
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,180
The way they accept things is absolutely unbelievable.

167
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,020
I think it is a kind of a slavish mentality

168
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,780
which does not give them freedom

169
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,140
to think what is right, what is wrong.

170
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,140
For this, we have Christ. We have Christ, a person

171
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,300
who was absolutely free,

172
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,660
free from all kinds of prejudices,

173
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,260
all kinds of temptations,

174
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,060
all kinds of nonsense that human beings follow.

175
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,060
But one may say that: "Mother, after all, He was divine!"

176
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,100
He was divine and now you are made divine also.

177
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:11,700
So, how can we now join together to make a full effort,

178
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,580
a full effort, to tell people that:

179
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,340
"What are you doing? Why are you doing it?

180
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,140
What is the need to do such things?"

181
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,740
On one side is, we can say, a mass destruction

182
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:36,380
through stupidity, another side is your own self-destruction.

183
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:44,580
Take to drinking, take to other self-destructive things

184
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,500
which are immoral,

185
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,740
that's very easily available, and people like it very much.

186
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,140
They don't like when you talk that: "This is destructive."

187
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,980
So, either we destroy others or destroy ourselves.

188
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:08,420
Christ was destroyed by others and He resurrected by Himself.

189
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,260
So we are also in the same position now.

190
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,500
I know many a times Sahaja Yoga was challenged.

191
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,140
Now it's much better, not so bad...

192
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,420
was challenged and there were so many problems.

193
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,460
But now it's smoothing down,

194
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,940
because that's the Truth, that's the Reality,

195
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,100
that's what is Divinity.

196
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,740
So, you should not be afraid.

197
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:39,420
All these funny ideas about Sahaja Yoga also will die out.

198
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,100
It's a resurrection, not only of you people,

199
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,820
but also of your ideologies.

200
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,100
Now the ideologies change,

201
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,380
that our awareness should be enlightened.

202
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,180
We should have light in our awareness.

203
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,500
This has come suddenly through Sahaja Yoga to people, that:

204
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,620
"If you don't have the light,

205
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,140
how can you go further in the right path?"

206
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:14,100
It's not easy to describe Christ's life, how He went through that.

207
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,780
He died so young and brutally He was killed.

208
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,700
But still all that, He resurrected Himself.

209
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,940
He came out of all that, came out of that ordeal.

210
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,740
So for us also, when we are in Sahaja Yoga problems,

211
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,860
we should know we have a power to resurrect ourselves.

212
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,060
No one can destroy us! No one can finish us off,

213
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,340
because we have a power to resurrect ourselves.

214
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,620
This special power that we have to resurrect,

215
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:53,260
you should all the time understand and feel it and meditate on that.

216
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,660
I hear from people from every country:

217
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,260
"The government is doing like this,

218
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,940
the government is doing like this!"

219
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,620
or they are having some trouble,

220
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,340
they call you a sect, they call you this and that...

221
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,740
Alright, doesn't matter!

222
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,940
Your duty is to believe

223
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,260
that you are following the footsteps of Christ.

224
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,100
And no one can destroy it!

225
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,820
This is the message of Christ's life,

226
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,980
that divine life cannot be destroyed.

227
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,220
When this body could not be destroyed,

228
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,540
then how can you destroy the divine light in Him?

229
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
So many Sahaja Yogis are here,

230
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,980
who have been since long in Sahaja Yoga,

231
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,940
and they have had problems,

232
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,060
and they went through lot of troubles, I agree!

233
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,100
But all these things have subsided.

234
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,380
And now you are in such a resurrected position

235
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,260
that, after some time, -you'll be amazed-

236
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:56,460
Sahaja Yoga will take over, all over the world.

237
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,700
All over the world, people will take to Sahaja Yoga

238
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,820
and we'll have such a lot of Sahaja Yogis all over the world

239
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:09,940
that all this minority of some stupid people will disappear.

240
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,980
For that, what have you to do? Sometimes, people ask Me:

241
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,260
"What do we have to do?" You must have also read the Bible,

242
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,060
that Christ prayed and He was praying.

243
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,020
In the same way, we can say, we have to meditate.

244
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,140
Through meditation, we'll grow in our awareness,

245
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:36,980
in our new personality, in our strengthened personality.

246
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,220
Meditation is the only way we can grow,

247
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,540
and then no one can destroy you,

248
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,180
because you are all protected by the Divine Love.

249
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,500
You don't have to worry

250
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,380
as to who will destroy you, what will happen.

251
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,540
Of course, in the beginning there's little agitation,

252
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,420
people feel a little bad about it, it's alright!

253
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,660
But actually, NO ONE can destroy you.

254
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,740
Have this faith in you!

255
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,260
Christ had no organization;

256
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:10,980
He had no Adi Shakti to support Him, in no way.

257
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,420
But only through His divine personality,

258
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,500
He managed to get out of all the problems,

259
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:24,300
of all the tortures, of all the atrocities on Him.

260
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,140
So now, you have better advantage,

261
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,060
because you are enlightened.

262
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,020
Firstly, He was a divine person and He could go through that.

263
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,860
You don't have to!

264
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,100
Nobody will torture you, nobody will put you in jail,

265
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,060
nobody will crucify you.

266
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,700
Nobody will, that's not possible.

267
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,780
But mentally, if you are upset, sometimes you get upset I know,

268
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,380
in certain countries people get upset,

269
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,700
because they think they are oppressed because they are in Sahaja Yoga.

270
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,540
I assure you, no one can do that.

271
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:04,060
You must know that you are all the time protected.

272
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,740
Christ is there as your elder brother, I always said that.

273
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,260
But also you have your Mother,

274
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,460
and you have all the Ganas and all the Angels around you.

275
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,900
When I see this, I just thought: "Look at this,

276
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:26,340
in every country they have shown Angels and Ganas are there!"

277
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,180
Such pure forms of protection you have.

278
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,380
So there's nothing to worry about

279
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,740
your destruction or your impediments,

280
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,580
or whatever you may call it,

281
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:45,580
a kind of destructive forces acting on you.

282
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:51,580
From the life of Christ, you have to know that no one can destroy

283
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,260
a realised soul in these modern times.

284
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,340
As it is, they never destroyed.

285
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,780
We had so many Saints who were killed, who were tortured,

286
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,220
but see, they still exist as poetry, as poems,

287
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:14,660
also as blessings, everywhere they are not finished.

288
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,300
They are not dead, though it seems that they are no more,

289
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:25,980
but even to take their names and even to call them, they work out.

290
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:30,100
They are there in their Spirit and they help.

291
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,540
Assured by Christ's life,

292
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,780
by His resurrection, we are resurrected people.

293
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,500
Of course, our body also has changed.

294
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,860
After resurrection, you know that your Chakras work out

295
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,700
all the curing and all the blessings.

296
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,420
Our attitude, our mental attitude also changes,

297
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,540
and also your ego subsides.

298
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,900
Not only that, also our conditionings go out.

299
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:05,300
Specially I was so happy that those people, say,

300
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,660
who are born in a particular religion,

301
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,180
immediately they see what's wrong with that religion,

302
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:16,540
as if they turn round and see the image of their society

303
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,460
and know what's wrong with them.

304
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:24,340
And when they start meditating on those corrections,

305
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,220
it works, societies are improving.

306
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,220
You see, so-called religious ideas are falling into their own traps,

307
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,500
and they will all fall because they're falsehood.

308
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,220
That's not real religion.

309
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,740
The religion is within ourselves and this pure religion

310
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,380
is the one which is a global religion.

311
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:52,020
The solution comes like that: supposing you have wars...

312
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,060
wars in the name of religion,

313
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,700
in the name of God specially.

314
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,020
And in the name of religions they have wars.

315
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,500
So now, what happens?

316
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:15,940
All these wars that take place cannot destroy Reality,

317
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,140
cannot destroy the Truth.

318
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,620
This is another message of Christ's resurrection.

319
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,140
You cannot!

320
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,540
You may think that today you have destroyed these people,

321
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,500
but they are there.

322
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:34,500
All the Saints, all the great people

323
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:41,380
who have been resurrected in life are all the time there.

324
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,940
Their protections are there, their guidance is there,

325
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:51,100
you can see them in a way that they are there.

326
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:59,060
So one should have no fear. The fear of death has to go.

327
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,460
So many of them have said the same

328
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,460
that: "What is death after all?"

329
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,260
Death dies itself, once you are resurrected.

330
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,180
So one should not be afraid of death.

331
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,900
Now how many of you have been afraid of death

332
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,500
before your resurrection, but not now?

333
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,220
You are not bothered as to when the death comes, what happens

334
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,940
or which way you are going to be so-called destroyed.

335
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,180
You know you cannot be destroyed.

336
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,460
In your heart of hearts, you all know this very well,

337
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,140
that you cannot be destroyed.

338
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:45,060
The fear of our destruction goes away, no doubt.

339
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,260
But there is one thing, is the compassion.

340
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,580
When you see all these bad things are happening

341
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,420
and people are being tortured, your mind is... you see...

342
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,820
cannot take it for granted.

343
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,580
It starts responding to that,

344
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,220
and it feels the pain of others, tremendous!

345
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:15,020
But as a result of that, your will power,

346
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,900
your thinking on those lines, your tears even are powerful

347
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,140
and they can bring solace to those people

348
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,580
who are suffering unnecessarily.

349
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,460
You have to experiment with it.

350
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:41,340
Just having a feeling of compassion and love, things will improve.

351
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,660
Now, as it is, we meditate.

352
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:51,140
But we can meditate also with such compassion

353
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:57,740
and such love that your tears can also have an effect

354
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,300
on these people who are so cruel

355
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,300
and stupid and killing each other.

356
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,420
But it is important for you to know that now

357
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,980
you are not an individual, but you have become a global personality,

358
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,380
a global personality.

359
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,780
You are not an individual, you are a global personality,

360
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:26,140
and sitting down here, you are working out all the global problems.

361
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,060
You are not a small person now,

362
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,260
who's only worried about your own children,

363
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,780
about your family, about this and that, no!

364
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,620
This mind of yours has expanded, expanded like this,

365
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:46,260
that it works automatically for all the problems of the world.

366
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,100
When for a woman I read newspapers,

367
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,980
specially women seldom read newspapers,

368
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,620
they think it's stupidity to read those papers.

369
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:00,540
But I read, I read and I read those where My attention is in it.

370
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,220
I've seen it works! But all of you put together, if you understand

371
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,620
that this is your responsibility to correct

372
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:14,900
all the destructive forces, to put them right,

373
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,260
we just have to collectively meditate on the points

374
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,220
where you find there's a big problem.

375
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:28,020
Now the problem mainly is because of religions, mainly.

376
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,580
Now, if they can all jump into the new religion,

377
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,020
global religion, they all are one.

378
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,580
They cannot then fight because there's one religion.

379
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,780
But they don't want to have one religion,

380
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,620
because they want to fight. They're fighting cocks.

381
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,900
But if they come to Sahaj, if they become enlightened,

382
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,740
then they will only enjoy love of each other

383
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,700
and not killing of each other, destruction of others.

384
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,060
And this is what we have to learn from life of Christ,

385
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,980
who was alone, who was single.

386
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,500
He did not have such a collective behind Him.

387
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,940
But how powerful He was that He fought the death

388
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,820
and came out of it so clearly at the stage of Agnya!

389
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,340
Without Him, we could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga.

390
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,780
Kundalini would not have gone through,

391
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,500
unless and until He had sacrificed His life.

392
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,500
And He readily sacrificed,

393
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:32,540
He accepted the task of sacrificing His life,

394
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,620
and then resurrected.

395
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,740
He passed through that, I should say,

396
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,300
a very constricted channel of Agnya,

397
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:48,740
to put you people right, by saying: "You forgive everyone."

398
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,580
If forgiving was such a powerful thing

399
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,700
that you can even fight your death, then why not forgive?

400
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,260
Many people say: "Mother, we can't forgive!"

401
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,940
and I've told hundred times that:

402
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,460
"What are you doing if not forgiving?"

403
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,300
So, the message of Christ's life is that He forgot,

404
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,380
forgave all the people who troubled Him.

405
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,820
Even He said that: "O God, please forgive them,

406
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,500
because they don't know what they are doing!"

407
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:22,620
On the cross, He said those things, when He was tortured, insulted,

408
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,340
He's saying what? "You forgive them,

409
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,620
have pity, have sympathy for them,

410
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,980
because they don't know what they are doing!" They are killing

411
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,940
the Son of God, and what will happen to them?

412
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,580
Where will they go? What will be their situation?

413
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:47,580
This one is a big message for us,

414
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,620
that even on the cross, He said: "Forgive,

415
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,540
O God, O Father, forgive them!"

416
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,620
In the same way, we have to also forgive people.

417
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:05,500
It's very important from the life of Christ that we have to forgive.

418
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:11,300
His forgiveness was of the greatest importance.

419
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,460
For the whole world to understand, you must forgive.

420
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,460
If you learn how to forgive, you'll be amazed,

421
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,940
half of the wars of this world will be finished!

422
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,220
Now, something happened thousands of years back.

423
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,500
Still people are fighting, still they are fighting,

424
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,260
thinking these things happened so many years back,

425
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,060
so they are our ennemies.

426
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,740
If He can really forgive those people,

427
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:44,020
what happened before we were even born,

428
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:49,540
why should we form a group of such people, why?

429
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,860
Because there is something called hatred in human beings,

430
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,660
they have hatred, hatred for this, hatred for that,

431
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,980
even in small things they'll say: "I don't like it, I like it!"

432
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,540
It's very common,

433
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,220
nowadays specially.

434
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,180
When we were young, we were not supposed to say such a thing:

435
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,660
"I don't like it, I like it!",

436
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,580
we were not supposed to say.

437
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,500
But now their freedom has given them to talk like this:

438
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,020
"I don't like it, I don't like that,

439
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:33,540
I don't like that, I don't like that person!" Who are you?

440
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,820
What do you think of yourself to judge others?

441
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,940
You don't know how to appreciate,

442
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,940
you don't know how to enjoy

443
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,700
and only what you go on is: "I don't like it!"

444
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,620
And supposing you like it, what will you do?

445
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:52,140
Whether you like it or don't like is just the same!

446
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,180
But just to show off their ego, we say:

447
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,580
"I don't like this way, I don't like!"

448
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,540
Because there's no love!

449
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:10,780
If there is love, then you can enjoy everything.

450
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,660
We'll never say: "I don't like it, I like it!"

451
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:21,540
You will definitely enjoy if you really say

452
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,540
that: "I enjoy, I enjoy everything!"

453
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,380
You are closing down yourself by saying:

454
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,740
"I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like!"

455
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,940
as if you are a great connoisseur,

456
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,900
or a person, a judge, to say this!

457
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:45,260
It is very remarkable that in the West it's even more prominent

458
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,940
that they will say: "I don't like it, I don't like!"

459
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,060
Of course, in the East, I would say in India,

460
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,220
if somebody says like that, people will say

461
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,540
he's just trying to show off. On the face!

462
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:04,900
But showing off is not regarded as bad manners.

463
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,900
It's not regarded as bad manners in the West.

464
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,540
To feel shy of anything is regarded as bad manners,

465
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:19,900
but to boast of something, nobody feels that it is a bad thing.

466
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,860
Did Christ boast of anything? Never!

467
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:27,180
He never boasted of anything,

468
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:35,260
but when He saw people were selling things in the holy places,

469
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,020
what did He do?

470
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,380
He started beating them with a hunter,

471
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,380
because that was wrong, absolutely wrong,

472
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,660
against the holiness of the place.

473
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,300
But He did not say: "I don't like it!" No!

474
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:56,460
He just showed His complete disapproval

475
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,820
of the whole system of selling things

476
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,860
in the temple or in a holy place.

477
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,700
People go there to worship.

478
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:14,500
They need a mind which is devoid of money orientation.

479
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:23,900
There should be no money orientation when you are meditating.

480
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,460
This is the biggest problem of today.

481
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:31,020
Everything is money orientation.

482
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:37,220
You like a car which is very expensive, so you want to have.

483
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,700
By hook and crook, you will get that car and sit in there.

484
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:48,100
You might be a thief, but you buy an expensive car to show off,

485
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,460
perhaps maybe because you are a thief, that's why you want to hide

486
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,740
your personality.

487
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,740
So there is no truthful life, it's all just showing off

488
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,060
and thinking no end of yourself.

489
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:08,220
But when the death will come at your doorstep, what will you do?

490
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,700
At that time, you will be trembling

491
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,180
with all your so-called achievements

492
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,100
and your so-called showing off.

493
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,060
You will just tremble before death.

494
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,580
But a Sahaja Yogi cannot!

495
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:31,660
He will like, if the death has to come, it has to come!

496
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:37,420
He will not tremble that the death is something dangerous,

497
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,740
but is a place where he can go and rest.

498
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,180
He won't mind, he won't mind anything,

499
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:49,580
because he is above that, he is above destruction.

500
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,980
So, he won't mind anything, whatever comes his way

501
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,700
and he will surrender to it easily.

502
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,540
We have Kabir. Kabir has written so many poems,

503
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,660
mostly about death.

504
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,660
He said: "When death came, I didn't say a single word,

505
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,100
I didn't fight, but what I did,

506
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:21,620
I took a sheet on top of me and went off to sleep!"

507
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,660
How sweetly he described death sometimes,

508
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,700
and Kabir then reminds Me of Christ.

509
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:34,060
How sweetly Christ also went through all these things,

510
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:42,380
and when He died, the whole elements shook.

511
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,300
He was the master of elements.

512
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,700
They shook,

513
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:51,180
there was earthquake and all kinds of things that happened.

514
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,900
They, they felt His death, not Him!

515
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,220
They felt that such a great divinity

516
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:08,940
which is the essence of existence has been killed like this.

517
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,980
They also didn't know that He is going to come back to His life.

518
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,100
They also were not aware of it, but He did.

519
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:21,260
He did come out of that deadening thing, for which

520
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,780
everybody was so much shocked.

521
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:32,100
His death itself gives us strength,

522
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,060
that we have no death, we have resurrected

523
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,460
and resurrection is with us.

524
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,460
But we have to establish,

525
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:47,580
we have to establish our Sahaja Yoga, our meditation.

526
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,420
That's very important.

527
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,220
The other day, I met a lady.

528
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:57,500
She told of a miracle in her life, how she was saved.

529
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:03,140
She was about to die, she came across an accident, all kind...

530
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,580
But how she was saved, while her husband,

531
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,980
he succumbs to all kinds of things. So I said:

532
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,580
"What do you mean, how it happened?" She said:

533
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,260
"Mother, it's nothing but Shraddha!"

534
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,380
Shraddha is dedication, surrendering.

535
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:27,700
"Surrendering, because I'm surrendered!"

536
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,140
But I said: "How?" "That, I don't know, I'm just surrendered.

537
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:38,500
I feel so comfortable, so lively and so much out of fear

538
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,860
when I know I'm surrendered,

539
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,980
completely surrendered to my Spirit!"

540
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,540
And this what it is what we have to learn

541
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,980
when we meditate, that we have to surrender.

542
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,660
Muhammad has called "Islam". Islam means surrender,

543
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,820
though they don't surrender -otherwise you see...-

544
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,700
but what is that you must surrender

545
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:05,900
to your global nature, to your higher nature.

546
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,460
You must not die out,

547
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,700
you must not fizzle out

548
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:16,980
into these worldly turmoil and worldly things.

549
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:22,820
It's a very strength-giving example of Christ.

550
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,940
And He's with us, He will always guide us, He'll look after us,

551
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,980
not only but He'll give us strength.

552
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:37,100
He will destroy all those who will be against eternal life.

553
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,300
He'll destroy nonsensical things.

554
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,380
And you are seeing now how in Kali Yuga all these institutions

555
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:49,220
who talk of religion and fights are getting destroyed.

556
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,060
Automatically, we have done nothing.

557
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:56,540
On their own only, while they're doing, they are finishing,

558
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,980
because there's no Reality, there's no Spirit in it,

559
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:07,020
and without the Spirit, what is left is nothing but a dead body.

560
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:12,220
The whole understanding should be for Sahaja Yogis,

561
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:16,620
that we have to be Spirit-oriented,

562
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:22,540
not money-oriented, body-oriented, emotion-oriented,

563
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,740
but Spirit-oriented,

564
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,180
which is a joy-giving thing.

565
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,940
And you'll be surprised with that orientation,

566
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:39,380
you will be the most happy, most loving,

567
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,860
most beautiful person.

568
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,260
Immediately, people will know around

569
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,420
that there's something about this man, some spark

570
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:55,900
about this lady, some sort of a spark that she is or he is

571
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:02,180
so much different from us. It can be recognized in no time.

572
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:08,460
Now, at the time of Christ, very few people could recognize,

573
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,820
because they were not enlightened,

574
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:19,100
because they were very much below the level of human beings,

575
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,980
I should say. But you are not!

576
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:26,140
You are quite aware, you are born in modern times,

577
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,060
and at this time, when we think of Christ,

578
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,580
we should know what a life it was,

579
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,060
what a grand personality it was,

580
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,820
that He subjected to this kind of a torture.

581
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,580
He could have destroyed all of them in no time.

582
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,580
He was so powerful, such a powerful personality,

583
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:49,980
but He did not! He forgave them.

584
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,820
He gave you the message of forgiveness,

585
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,740
the greatest force that can work out.

586
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,260
Now also, you should surrender yourself

587
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:03,580
to this idea of forgiveness and really try to forgive.

588
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,420
You'll be amazed, you will feel very much peaceful, very happy,

589
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:12,500
and the person who has tortured you will come round.

590
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:17,740
What we have to do is now to transform people. That's our job.

591
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,500
We have to transform them. We are transformed.

592
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,540
We are at a point, we can call it, we are resurrected.

593
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,980
We have to resurrect the whole world, that's our job,

594
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,500
so that all these fights, all these quarrels,

595
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:35,020
all these falsehoods will just be finished.

596
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,900
For us, Christ is our leader, who has done this for us.

597
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,820
He came as an ordinary human being,

598
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,900
lived like an ordinary human being,

599
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,460
with all these powers within Him.

600
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,900
He never used them to destroy.

601
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,820
In the same way, we can also with love and affection,

602
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:57,780
we can also really come out of our deaths,

603
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,180
come out of our misgivings,

604
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,660
come out of our destructive nature.

605
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:10,180
This destructive nature is the most dangerous thing for Yogis.

606
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:16,900
That's the only hope we have, that Sahaja Yogis are resurrected.

607
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:21,380
Only thing I know is that,

608
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:26,340
if we have so many Sahaja Yogis, this world will change.

609
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,180
This world has to change.

610
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,660
But your progress should go on,

611
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:35,460
you should progress more and more, not you should not regress back.

612
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,340
For small things here and there, don't worry!

613
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,260
You have a very great responsibility,

614
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:46,740
and that responsibility is to transform the human beings.

615
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:51,820
That's your due. How many have you transformed?

616
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:57,180
How many have you changed? It's all right for men or women.

617
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,500
You have to change people, this is your job

618
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:04,180
and this is the power you have got from Christ,

619
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:07,500
that you have to change them, transform them

620
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,060
into the new world of happiness and joy

621
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:17,500
which we call it as the Sahaj Nirmal Dharma.

622
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,340
If it works out, if it really works out,

623
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,220
think of the world, how beautiful it will become for us!

624
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,980
It's the duty of every Sahaja Yogi

625
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:34,260
to go into this kind of a new venture

626
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:39,500
and try to find out how many people he can convert

627
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,580
and how many people he can bring round.

628
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:46,500
I hope next time we'll have doubled the number of people

629
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,820
that are here from all these eight countries who are hosting now.

630
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,300
All My love to you all.

631
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,940
Great days are waiting us.

632
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:03,820
We have to now understand only our responsibility.

633
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:07,500
Main thing is how many people we have converted,

634
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,020
how many people we have resurrected.

635
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,820
That is the record, not what,

636
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,220
how many Pujas you have attended and all that.

637
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,660
It's not so important.

638
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,300
Pujas are just to give you strength and to give you power,

639
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,500
but they are not your work. That's not your work.

640
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,020
For your work, you can take from Pujas

641
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,900
all the strength that you need.

642
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:34,420
But if you don't use this power, then what's the use?

643
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,540
So now, I leave it to you to remember

644
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,460
that you are resurrected and you have to resurrect others.

645
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,900
It's a very, very important job

646
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:48,580
at this time of complete turmoil and destruction.

647
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,420
May God bless you!
