1
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:11,042
The difference between us and Christ is that

2
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:13,876
faith was part and parcel of His being.

3
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:19,042
It was not that He had to have faith – He was faith.

4
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:22,667
Now we have to have it.

5
00:00:23,209 --> 00:00:26,918
We have to believe in ourselves.

6
00:00:27,584 --> 00:00:29,626
There’s so many incidents I can give you

7
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,876
which you can also tell Me, so many incidents

8
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:36,999
where just the faith has helped.

9
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:40,751
If you were in Romania I think it happened,

10
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,584
one lady came on the stage, she couldn’t walk,

11
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:46,250
they had to bring her on a wheelchair.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,125
And she said, “Mother, I know You can cure me.

13
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:52,709
Nobody can cure me; I know You can cure me.”

14
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:54,417
She said it three times.

15
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:56,709
I said, “So, you believe that I’ll cure you.”

16
00:00:56,834 --> 00:00:59,334
“Yes.” I said, “Then get up.”

17
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,459
She just got up, walked out.

18
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:04,375
And then she started running all the way,

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,667
and everybody started laughing.

20
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:08,751
They said, “Mother, she’s not a Sahaja yogini!”

21
00:01:08,876 --> 00:01:11,459
I said, “But see her faith!”

22
00:01:11,792 --> 00:01:17,667
Because when there is faith all the deities take it up:

23
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:24,999
they’re challenged, they have to do it.

24
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,709
They have shown faith in that person.

25
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,751
As I have told you always,

26
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:34,167
in Sahaja Yoga we trust people, we trust.

27
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:36,083
One among hundred might deceive us

28
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,999
doesn’t matter, we trust.

29
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:42,125
That faith you put in that person works in his mind also,

30
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,417
that “they have put so much faith in me.”

31
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:47,709
But what about deities?

32
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:50,999
You show faith in them and it works,

33
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,751
immediately they work out.

34
00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:54,375
Like Guido told Me that

35
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,626
“Mother, they said there will be heavy rains

36
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,709
for these two days.”

37
00:01:59,834 --> 00:02:03,918
I said, “All right. Don’t worry.” ,Where is the rain?

38
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,083
It disappeared.

39
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,999
You can control anything if your faith is under control.

40
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:20,999
And when we talk of faith, you know,

41
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:27,209
it’s the challenge to this all-pervading Power,

42
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,959
which organizes, which knows everything,

43
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,876
which is so intelligent, efficient

44
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:37,792
– above all, it loves you.

45
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:40,999
And then you show faith.

46
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:49,667
The resurrection in Sahaja Yoga is that your faith is solid.

47
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:55,626
This you have to achieve: solid faith.

48
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,834
They don’t feel then bad,

49
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,918
supposing I may not meet them, supposing I may say,

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,792
“All right, come. You see, this time I may not be there.”

51
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:07,250
Nothing matters, you see, whether Mother meets us or not,

52
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,250
whether this thing happens or not.

53
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:14,292
Everything is for our good, for our benevolence.

54
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:16,417
Supposing you are lost on the way,

55
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:19,834
know that it has to be that way.

56
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,459
If you have to look at the life of Christ,

57
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:26,417
He was to be crucified.

58
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,250
He had to carry the cross,

59
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,250
He had to do all these things – it’s all right, whatever.

60
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,542
“It’s fated. I’ll do it.”

61
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,500
He never grumbled, He never grudged,

62
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:41,584
He didn’t want anybody to share His problems.

63
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,250
But this faith in Him gave Him

64
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:50,626
such a tremendous powers.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He could have done anything.

66
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,417
He could have killed all these people

67
00:03:56,542 --> 00:04:00,417
who were trying to persecute Him, easily – what’s the harm?

68
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:02,792
Just one glance could have killed them.

69
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:06,125
But no, He knew He had to go through all that,

70
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,709
He went through it.

71
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:11,584
Ultimately, He is the one who’s victorious,

72
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,542
He is the one who won everything.

73
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,042
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi

74
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:19,584
has to look at one’s own life.

75
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:26,042
It’s very precious, life, it’s very precious in this world.

76
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:31,209
These days, the how many there are Sahaja yogis?

77
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:40,250
So when you have complete faith in yourself,

78
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:43,334
then you don’t bother.

79
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:46,459
Many people will find out whether

80
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:49,250
“I go there – there’ll be a bathroom or not,

81
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:53,918
or there will be a place to sleep or not?” Nothing.

82
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:59,125
You are looking for the comfort of your spirit.

83
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,876
If you get, well and good, otherwise you can sleep anywhere.

84
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,250
Nothing can bind you,

85
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:08,667
nothing can pull you down,

86
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:12,626
no habit can come back on you;

87
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:20,000
because faith will purify you completely,

88
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:23,959
it will enlighten you, it will nourish you.

89
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:28,167
This faith is not something

90
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,209
that can be put into your heads

91
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:33,918
or can be put into your hearts, cannot be.

92
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:39,459
It’s a state which you have to achieve,

93
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:45,167
and which you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga.

94
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:50,375
That’s how our resurrection would be complete,

95
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,751
would be established,

96
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:55,999
would be effective,

97
00:05:56,083 --> 00:06:01,459
and for the whole world will be a model.

98
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,083
May God bless you all.
