1
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:43,409
It is a very unique opportunity, I think,

2
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:46,867
for Me to meet you again in Bombay

3
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:50,533
when you are all leaving this country,

4
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:57,825
and this kind of a special type of a puja

5
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,825
that we are having today.

6
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:05,451
This is the puja done to the sun,

7
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:10,075
and is called as Makar Sankrant.

8
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:17,867
"Makar" is the tropic of Capricorn,

9
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:19,825
Capricorn is Makar.

10
00:04:20,742 --> 00:04:24,492
So now the sun is moving from the tropic of Capricorn

11
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:29,034
towards the tropic of Cancer,

12
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,617
and is always a fixed date because it's a,

13
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:34,700
it has something to do with the sun.

14
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,825
This is the only date which is fixed in the Indian calendar,

15
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:40,992
because they have to deal with the sun.

16
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:42,867
But this time, I don't know why, what has happened

17
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,867
that they have put it on the fifteenth

18
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,617
of this month - it's always the fourteenth.

19
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:52,909
Now today is, they are changing,

20
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:58,409
I would say that the seasons are going to be changed.

21
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:04,950
We've got six months when this moves,

22
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:08,326
sun moves towards the southern hemisphere

23
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,950
and makes it warm, and it comes to the northern hemisphere

24
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:16,825
from tomorrow.

25
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:21,909
So today is the last day, which we say that

26
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:24,575
is the day which is the coldest day,

27
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,617
according to Indian understanding.

28
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:31,909
After this the heat will start growing

29
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:36,825
and all the - we can do anything that is auspicious,

30
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:41,700
any auspicious things can be done after this puja is over,

31
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,034
during the summer-time.

32
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:46,533
Though it's very hot in summer,

33
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:50,367
still people wants the sun to rule us

34
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:52,284
and to give us warmth because,

35
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,409
because of him only all the fields and all the vegetables,

36
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:01,201
all the fruits, everything grows.

37
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:06,284
And that's why when the six months the sun is not here,

38
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,159
we call it as "Sankrant,"

39
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,451
meaning a "calamity" in a way.

40
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:13,326
That is when of course in the,

41
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:19,201
in the European countries or say in England or America,

42
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:24,533
it is a calamity at that time when the sun is not there.

43
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:29,867
But even here it is regarded as a time today,

44
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:33,451
it's the day that the end of the Sankrant,

45
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:35,992
means the end of the calamity is over.

46
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:40,075
And they give something sweet to eat

47
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:44,201
which is also mixed with sesame seeds,

48
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:47,491
because sesame seed is heat-giving.

49
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:52,367
So today being the coldest day they want to give sesame seed,

50
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:56,117
also want you to retain the heat

51
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:59,533
and to adjust yourself to the heat that's coming up.

52
00:06:59,825 --> 00:07:02,533
This is all thought of in a way,

53
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:03,867
in a very gross level,

54
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:05,326
on a very gross level,

55
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:08,867
that we should keep the people warm enough.

56
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:11,075
Also it is said that

57
00:07:11,326 --> 00:07:17,409
the warmth of love should be expressed at this time

58
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:20,617
for people, because it is the coldest day.

59
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:24,451
So they say that "We give you this special thing for you

60
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:27,533
to say something sweet" - that is "goad goad bola"

61
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,409
- means "you say something sweet to us."

62
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:34,117
And the people who live in warm countries are sweeter people

63
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:37,201
than the people who live in colder places,

64
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:41,075
because the nature is rather very unkind to them.

65
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:43,326
I don't blame them for their temperament,

66
00:07:43,658 --> 00:07:46,075
because the nature is so unkind.

67
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:48,409
In India you can live anywhere:

68
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,242
you can live under a tree,

69
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:53,409
you can live in a forest,

70
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,658
anywhere you can live quite happily,

71
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,658
as long as there is water to drink and water to bathe.

72
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:03,783
And there's not such a problem as

73
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:06,700
we have to face in the other parts of the world,

74
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,825
where if you have to go out of the house

75
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:12,491
you take about fifteen, twenty minutes to dress yourself up.

76
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:14,409
Here you just can walk out of the house,

77
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:17,409
you can keep your houses open during the summer-time,

78
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:20,242
and there's no problem of any kind

79
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:22,409
as far as the nature is concerned.

80
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:27,117
Nature becomes very kind during summer-time here because

81
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:31,950
the trees are lush and lot of greenery,

82
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:35,242
people feel very happy during that time,

83
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:44,284
and all the activity becomes more with the sun's energy.

84
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:50,075
But in the West as you have seen that the sun is much less.

85
00:08:50,491 --> 00:08:51,658
Because of that,

86
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:53,575
people keep more to their houses,

87
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,159
to artificial heating or other heatings,

88
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:58,492
and the doors are closed,

89
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,409
the hearts are closed,

90
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:04,491
and it's difficult for them to

91
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:08,492
communicate with other people.

92
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:13,825
As you go down south more in your countries also,

93
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:16,075
you'll find people are warmer,

94
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,284
simpler,

95
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:24,159
very hospitable.

96
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:29,533
With the sun you get the heart which is very open heart,

97
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:33,533
and a kind of a inviting heart.

98
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:37,242
Now if you see on the Sahaja Yoga style,

99
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:39,825
the sun line is the right side

100
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:43,326
and the moon, moon is the left side.

101
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:45,491
On the moon line

102
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:49,034
one can desire but cannot act.

103
00:09:50,117 --> 00:09:52,284
Apart from that, on the moon line

104
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:55,242
if you go too far it can be destructive.

105
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:58,367
Because if you sit in the house doing nothing

106
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,409
- and also these days there's unemployment, say for example,

107
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,242
no work - then you start thinking too much,

108
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:13,909
and this thinking is just the desire energy working out,

109
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:15,367
no action.

110
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:17,367
And without the action

111
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,950
this energy can become very destructive.

112
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:22,909
That is why we find that people,

113
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:24,909
they say that "empty mind,

114
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:30,909
empty mind is the devil's workshop."

115
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,117
Where people have, do not act,

116
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:36,783
when the action doesn't take place,

117
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:39,159
then it can be quite destructive...

118
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:51,658
So the whole situation is different

119
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:53,367
in a country which is warm,

120
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:55,700
and a country which is not warm.

121
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:59,909
But in a country where it is very warm also,

122
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,284
like Africa,

123
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:04,700
there are complications due to too much of heat.

124
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:10,825
Like we have the tropic of -

125
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:14,117
mean the equator passing through,

126
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:17,242
and it heats up that area so much

127
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:21,533
that it becomes full of jungles,

128
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:24,491
very high trees and tall trees;

129
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:28,491
and the whole place is covered with foliage so much

130
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:30,909
that there's no possibility

131
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:37,242
for any sunshine to penetrate through,

132
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:40,117
and it's quite dark,

133
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,783
it's full of darkness.

134
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:46,201
So that extreme also comes in the same category

135
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:48,992
as the extreme of the cold season.

136
00:11:49,326 --> 00:11:51,201
Now such people live there

137
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:55,950
and they, naturally because the sun is less,

138
00:11:56,242 --> 00:11:58,242
so they do not grow much;

139
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:01,326
and they can be primitive people

140
00:12:01,658 --> 00:12:03,867
and they can be quite aggressive,

141
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,617
like they learn things from the animals

142
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:09,451
and they could be quite aggressive.

143
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,533
So the balance has to be struck,

144
00:12:13,117 --> 00:12:14,783
and the balance is that,

145
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:22,242
that we should desire and act.

146
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:27,950
But the trouble is in human atmosphere

147
00:12:28,242 --> 00:12:31,451
there is a division of labor, I think,

148
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:36,742
that one part of the country is thinking,

149
00:12:36,742 --> 00:12:40,492
another part of the country is acting.

150
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:44,326
Under these circumstances nothing works out.

151
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:48,867
So a balance has to be struck where

152
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,409
you have the Sushumna working out.

153
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:55,867
Now the Sushumna Nadi is the one where

154
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,242
one would say is the equator - it's not,

155
00:13:00,242 --> 00:13:01,617
is not the equator,

156
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:05,326
but is the axis of the Mother Earth.

157
00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:08,658
Axis of the Mother Earth is the Sushumna,

158
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,658
and that has to act;

159
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:13,742
and when it comes to that axis then we should understand that we have to be on our axis.

160
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:19,658
So we are on the axis,it is the one that balances.

161
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:24,367
Actually there is, there is, there is nothing

162
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:26,242
like a big pole

163
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:29,367
inside the Mother Earth which we can call it as an axis.

164
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:33,575
There is nothing that is material

165
00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:36,950
inside the Mother Earth that we can call it as an axis,

166
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,575
but it's the energy force

167
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:41,159
which acts in such a manner

168
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,909
that the Earth moves with such tremendous speed

169
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,242
when the cosmos is all spread out so much.

170
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:55,097
It not only moves but it creates day and night for us,

171
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:58,775
so that day-time we can work and night-time we can sleep,

172
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:00,441
to give us a balance.

173
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:04,982
Only also it moves in such a manner round the sun

174
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:11,525
that half of the countries get the sun

175
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,441
during the summer-time,

176
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:17,858
and half of them get it during the winter-time.

177
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,733
That's the axis that acts and works out everything.

178
00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:22,900
Apart from that,

179
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,650
this axis keeps all the distances necessary

180
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:32,274
from other planets and other moving bodies in the cosmos.

181
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,983
This axis is the intelligence of the Mother Earth.

182
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:43,066
It is not only the intelligence but it is the fragrance,

183
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:47,900
and apart from, it is the Sushumna Nadi,

184
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,983
you can say, of the Mother Earth.

185
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:54,441
Now through this axis only all these swayambhus

186
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:59,525
and all these great happenings of earthquakes

187
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,441
and all that takes place.

188
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,191
This axis is the one which moves.

189
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:07,274
It's an energy, we can call it axis as the energy,

190
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:12,149
moves the lava into different directions

191
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:20,191
and pierces through different areas to create earthquakes,

192
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:23,024
and also to have

193
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:30,692
... volcanoes, volcanoes.

194
00:15:31,024 --> 00:15:36,692
And all these things happen because the axis has sense

195
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:37,942
what is to be done.

196
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:41,024
This axis is the one that loves us.

197
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,483
Because of this axis we,

198
00:15:44,817 --> 00:15:46,692
we have seasons.

199
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:50,358
The seasons are created beautifully to give us

200
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:53,441
different, different varieties of food

201
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:55,942
and varieties of things.

202
00:15:56,733 --> 00:16:00,942
The heat of the Mother Earth if it is lost,

203
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:04,483
then we'll have nothing on this Earth,

204
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:09,149
it'll be all frozen and there will be all snow,

205
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:12,024
and we'll have no food, nothing,

206
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,983
and it will be like moon living here.

207
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:18,149
Now it has been specially created:

208
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:22,108
first the Mother Earth when it was created

209
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,024
through the heat of the sun,

210
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:29,817
so we can say that the sun is the father of the Mother Earth.

211
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:34,024
Then she was brought very close to the moon

212
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:37,108
so it cooled down, absolutely it cooled down,

213
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:38,692
it was all snow.

214
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:42,608
Then it was brought closer to the sun

215
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,483
and moved at a point where

216
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:48,233
life could start working,

217
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:51,692
and that's how the whole thing was organized beautifully

218
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:54,900
to make life grow in that area.

219
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:57,108
Now when the life started growing,

220
00:16:57,108 --> 00:17:01,817
gradually we know that how the carbon was formed.

221
00:17:01,982 --> 00:17:05,400
Now the carbon is formed by the same axis,

222
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,608
because there's heat in the axis,

223
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:10,733
the energy of heat that converts

224
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:18,982
the plants into carbon.

225
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:21,858
Now this carbon is, later on

226
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,692
forms the basis for,

227
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:27,400
we can say,

228
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,982
for the production of carbohydrates,

229
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:35,233
you can say,

230
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,817
or all organic matter.

231
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:42,149
But to create life we had to have another help,

232
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,733
is the nitrogen;

233
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:47,274
and this nitrogen was also, you'll be surprised to know,

234
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:51,400
that was created by the same axis, by its movement.

235
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:54,274
And when it created this nitrogen,

236
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,983
the nitrogen gave us the amino acids;

237
00:17:57,274 --> 00:18:00,692
and when the amino acids were created within us,

238
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:08,024
then we started our lives from amoeba and all that.

239
00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:12,525
Of course this was done in the ocean,

240
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:15,566
because in the ocean with the movement,

241
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:18,982
nitrogen was created and life was created,

242
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:22,149
and then through the ocean it's emitted out,

243
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,400
and that's how we have amino acids.

244
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:29,108
With the amino acids, the formation of amino acids

245
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,108
gave us the combinations and permutations,

246
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:33,400
different lives.

247
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:36,692
So in the whole evolutionary process

248
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:40,692
the Mother Earth has played a very big part through her axis.

249
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:43,149
In the same way in human beings,

250
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,274
the axis is the most important thing.

251
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:50,733
That's the main principle of life we have got, is our axis.

252
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:53,400
We have to stand on our axis.

253
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:56,233
Those who do not stand on their axis,

254
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:59,608
stand more towards the left or towards the right,

255
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:04,149
are capable of complete destruction;

256
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:07,274
because either they will be destroyed by

257
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:11,024
too much of right side or too much of left side.

258
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:15,858
So our axis has to be properly dealt with.

259
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:19,108
Now those people who do not have a proper axis

260
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,483
can have problems of different chakras,

261
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:28,233
of different kind of quality in a person.

262
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:32,441
A person who stretches his axis too much,

263
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:34,483
puts back his head like this,

264
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:36,733
is a person who is very right-sided

265
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:39,441
and creates problem with his ego;

266
00:19:39,441 --> 00:19:41,817
and the one who absolutely bends down

267
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:46,733
like a slavish person also is a person

268
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:49,274
who goes towards his destructiveness.

269
00:19:49,274 --> 00:19:54,149
Now there's a big problem between these two types of people,

270
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:56,483
one trying to dominate another,

271
00:19:56,483 --> 00:20:00,733
and when they start dominating another person

272
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,858
they actually destroy themselves,

273
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:05,900
as well as destroy the ones whom they are dominating.

274
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,233
For example now,

275
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:11,733
we have seen that we had

276
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:14,817
Britishers who came here and ruled us.

277
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:18,358
We have seen the French went and ruled some other people,

278
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:20,191
then there are Portuguese who went and ruled

279
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:21,441
some other people.

280
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:24,358
But everything that they did to dominate

281
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,441
and all that has double reactions.

282
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,024
First of all by their domination, say,

283
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:31,108
Indians became very slavish,

284
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:34,692
Indians became - even today they are extremely slavish,

285
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,566
and they do not have that independent axis

286
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:38,817
as they should have.

287
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:41,108
Extremely slavish people they are.

288
00:20:41,358 --> 00:20:43,316
I mean, especially I've seen in the West,

289
00:20:43,316 --> 00:20:45,608
I am surprised when the Indians go from here,

290
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:47,692
I find they are so very slavish.

291
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:52,149
They try to sort of do all kinds of slavish acts

292
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:54,900
to please the white-skinned people.

293
00:20:56,024 --> 00:21:00,983
The white skin became sort of a very adorable stuff in India.

294
00:21:02,483 --> 00:21:06,358
That added to the ego of the whites,

295
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,692
added to the ego of the whites,

296
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:10,900
and today you see what's happening is

297
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:12,983
all that ego is destroying them.

298
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:16,441
They are on the verge of destruction because of their ego.

299
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,024
So it is so unnatural and it is so superficial.

300
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:23,608
One has to understand that what is the best

301
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:25,983
within a human being is his axis,

302
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:27,942
and everybody has an axis,

303
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:31,608
and one must respect the axis of every person.

304
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:35,983
In Sahaja Yoga I don't know you by your faces so much;

305
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:38,692
I know you by your chakras,

306
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:39,942
by your Sushumna,

307
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:41,566
what sort of a Sushumna you have.

308
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:44,942
If you have a deep Sushumna, I know you as a deep person.

309
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:47,358
If you have a superficial Sushumna,

310
00:21:47,358 --> 00:21:50,775
I know you as a person with a very superficial

311
00:21:50,775 --> 00:21:52,983
type of a Sushumna.

312
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:57,441
And even if you make up something

313
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,900
by sort of being very nice or good,

314
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:03,108
or talking about Sahaja Yoga

315
00:22:03,108 --> 00:22:05,358
or knowing too much about Sahaja Yoga,

316
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:09,566
and saying things which will baffle normally anyone

317
00:22:09,817 --> 00:22:11,942
as if you are masters of Sahaja Yoga,

318
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:13,983
I know how deep you are.

319
00:22:15,358 --> 00:22:17,024
So the depth on the axis

320
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:19,358
is more important than anything else.

321
00:22:19,608 --> 00:22:23,108
Your axis has to be very deep.

322
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:24,858
Now you will say that "Mother,

323
00:22:24,858 --> 00:22:29,149
the axis is the same as it is, so how can it be deep?"

324
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:33,608
So the, in the axis as you see is made in human beings,

325
00:22:33,858 --> 00:22:39,358
is like a three-and-a-half coiled paper-like thing,

326
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:43,483
and the inside of it is the Brahma Nadi.

327
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:46,983
The Brahma Nadi is a very, very small little,

328
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:51,358
we can call a very, very hair-like thing

329
00:22:51,358 --> 00:22:56,358
where only a hair-like Kundalini can pass through.

330
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:00,441
But when the person is deep this Brahma Nadi is bigger,

331
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:02,149
and all the rest of them

332
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:07,108
which are coiled into each otherare smaller;

333
00:23:07,108 --> 00:23:10,024
while the people who are not deep, their outside

334
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:16,149
what you call the foldings are bigger

335
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:19,024
than the inside small thing.

336
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:22,942
Now such people could be apparently very dynamic,

337
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:25,817
may look very intelligent, may look very smart,

338
00:23:26,024 --> 00:23:27,983
may look to be very good-looking

339
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:30,233
or whatever it may be outwardly,

340
00:23:31,024 --> 00:23:33,608
but inwardly they are not deep.

341
00:23:34,024 --> 00:23:35,983
Inwardly if they are deep,

342
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:39,858
their whole attitude is beautiful.

343
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:42,149
They are very joy-giving people,

344
00:23:42,692 --> 00:23:44,274
they are very joy-giving.

345
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:48,983
And the more if you meet a person of another kind

346
00:23:49,358 --> 00:23:52,441
he may look joyous, he may try to give you joy,

347
00:23:52,441 --> 00:23:55,817
but the joy won't be really that deep;

348
00:23:56,024 --> 00:23:58,566
it would be like a joy-killing.

349
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:04,983
So it is important for us to make our axis deeper,

350
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:09,817
and that is where we lack the proper assiduity,

351
00:24:10,024 --> 00:24:14,483
the proper effort we have to put in.

352
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:20,149
Now some people have automatically a very deep axis,

353
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:25,817
and some people have very, very what you should say,

354
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:30,817
a very constricted type of the axis.

355
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:33,483
This axis has to be grown.

356
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:35,858
Now when you come for My puja and all that

357
00:24:35,858 --> 00:24:37,733
I do expand it, I agree,

358
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:41,483
but it is temporary thing.

359
00:24:41,817 --> 00:24:46,566
To retain it at that point one has to work at home,

360
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:48,817
in the collective also.

361
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:54,024
One has to work very much at home with meditation.

362
00:24:54,733 --> 00:24:57,024
But it should be done seriously.

363
00:24:57,274 --> 00:24:59,233
It should not be just a joke,

364
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:00,817
to be frivolous,

365
00:25:01,024 --> 00:25:03,483
to be stupid - that's not the way.

366
00:25:03,483 --> 00:25:07,358
It should be done very seriously, in the meaning

367
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:10,149
that it is a devoted task you have taken,

368
00:25:10,566 --> 00:25:13,358
it's a meditative thing;

369
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:16,608
it's a prayer to God we can call it,

370
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:18,608
it's a puja to God.

371
00:25:20,274 --> 00:25:22,983
Is to be done with that reverence,

372
00:25:23,566 --> 00:25:30,233
because reverence is the key of achievement.

373
00:25:31,441 --> 00:25:34,483
If you have no reverence about yourself

374
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:36,274
and no reverence of others,

375
00:25:36,274 --> 00:25:38,233
then it cannot be done.

376
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:41,733
But first you must have reverence for your own life.

377
00:25:41,983 --> 00:25:43,566
"What am I doing with my life?

378
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:44,858
Where am I wasting it?

379
00:25:44,858 --> 00:25:45,983
Why should I waste it?

380
00:25:45,983 --> 00:25:48,149
Why shouldn't I be deep?

381
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:50,233
After all, there must be some purpose of my life.

382
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:52,983
Am I serving my purpose, am I doing that?"

383
00:25:53,358 --> 00:25:56,775
All these things if they pop into your head,

384
00:25:56,775 --> 00:26:00,775
then you will understand it's very easy to fight out your ego,

385
00:26:00,983 --> 00:26:04,191
because normally on small, small things people fight.

386
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:08,358
I've seen that in Sahaja Yoga also people fight on things

387
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:12,108
like, I mean which are so useless, absolutely useless.

388
00:26:12,108 --> 00:26:16,066
To Me it sounds stupid to even mention

389
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:18,983
the way people fight over small things and quarrel.

390
00:26:19,358 --> 00:26:22,775
But a deep person, even if he doesn't speak much,

391
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:25,942
even if he doesn't show off much,

392
00:26:26,191 --> 00:26:28,775
even if he doesn't sit in the front line,

393
00:26:29,108 --> 00:26:31,650
he expresses himself through his depth,

394
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,566
because I can work out better through that.

395
00:26:36,608 --> 00:26:38,983
So to develop this one must meditate,

396
00:26:38,983 --> 00:26:40,983
important thing is to meditate;

397
00:26:40,983 --> 00:26:43,733
every day, every day, every day.

398
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:45,733
You may not eat your food one day,

399
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:47,233
you may not sleep one day,

400
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:50,274
you may not go to your office one day,

401
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:53,441
you may not do anything that you are doing every day

402
00:26:53,441 --> 00:26:55,608
- but you must meditate every day.

403
00:26:55,608 --> 00:26:57,233
That's an important point,

404
00:26:57,233 --> 00:27:03,942
to develop the central constricted part into a bigger area.

405
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:12,233
Now when that happens that you start developing it,

406
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:14,900
the first thing you will notice about yourself

407
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,983
that you do not care for any comfort,

408
00:27:18,942 --> 00:27:21,358
you're not bothered about any,

409
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:25,400
any material thing.

410
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:28,149
Whatever it is you are above it,

411
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:30,400
you just don't bother your head - let it be.

412
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,024
You just don't want to put your neck

413
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:36,274
into a thing where you do not belong.

414
00:27:36,858 --> 00:27:38,108
You just get out of it,

415
00:27:38,108 --> 00:27:39,650
and you think that

416
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,900
"Oh God, this is too much for me, I just don't care for it."

417
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:47,441
So your whole attention now moves inward.

418
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:49,858
When the attention starts moving inward

419
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:51,858
then it expands more.

420
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:55,316
It's the inner part which is called as the Brahma Nadi,

421
00:27:56,525 --> 00:28:00,191
and starts expanding and expanding.

422
00:28:00,775 --> 00:28:02,983
Now in small, small things also:

423
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:04,900
say for example

424
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:09,024
if I have not mentioned somebody

425
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:11,942
and mentioned somebody else,

426
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,483
then they feel,

427
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:16,858
"Oh, why didn't Mother mention my name?"

428
00:28:16,858 --> 00:28:20,483
It's too small a thing that it doesn't matter.

429
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:25,692
As long as you have a deep axis you are with Me,

430
00:28:25,692 --> 00:28:29,024
I am with you, absolutely one with each other.

431
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:31,650
But these outward things are,

432
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,900
"Oh, She gave a nice sari to another one,

433
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,233
She never gave us a sari, She didn't do this,

434
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:37,483
didn't do that."

435
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:39,983
All those things if it comes to your head,

436
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:42,817
that means absolutely it's true

437
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:46,483
that there is something lacking in you.

438
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:49,066
Or if you try to complain,

439
00:28:49,066 --> 00:28:51,775
"Oh, I went there, I had to go by a bus

440
00:28:51,775 --> 00:28:53,775
and I had to stand on this thing,"

441
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:56,441
that shows that you are not comforted at all.

442
00:28:58,775 --> 00:29:01,233
This widening comforts you.

443
00:29:01,692 --> 00:29:03,900
That's the comforting thing,

444
00:29:04,316 --> 00:29:07,441
and that really makes you feel so comfortable

445
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:12,900
in any circumstance, in any position, in any lifestyle,

446
00:29:13,358 --> 00:29:19,108
and you do not want to have any other comfort.

447
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:24,316
And this one has to develop,

448
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:26,316
through meditative effort.

449
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:30,525
Secondly is, we have to know that Sahaja Yoga

450
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:33,108
as it is today is a collective happening.

451
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:36,817
I find especially among Indian men,

452
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:39,024
they never do any work with their hands,

453
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:40,441
which is a wrong thing.

454
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:43,233
Because they don't use their hands at all

455
00:29:43,483 --> 00:29:45,483
their collectivity is poor, very poor.

456
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,817
Indians have the worst collectivity.

457
00:29:48,692 --> 00:29:49,983
If you have an ashram,

458
00:29:49,983 --> 00:29:51,650
I don't know why should we build the ashram,

459
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,316
nobody is going to stay there.

460
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,650
They want to have their own houses,

461
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,982
their own families,

462
00:29:57,982 --> 00:29:59,566
their own children;

463
00:29:59,817 --> 00:30:02,316
they are the worst of all for collectivity.

464
00:30:02,316 --> 00:30:06,316
The reason is, Indian men never do any work with their hands.

465
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:10,775
They cannot nail one nail - there are many like that

466
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:13,525
- leave alone repairing anything.

467
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:17,650
They will stand with their hands on their hips

468
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,650
and would just tell work to other people, you see.

469
00:30:21,983 --> 00:30:23,566
There's a Marathi saying,

470
00:30:23,817 --> 00:30:26,358
a very interesting ....

471
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:33,942
that is, "To sit on a camel and to drive the goats."

472
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:38,024
So that is very typical of Indian men.

473
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:39,692
They cannot repair anything,

474
00:30:39,692 --> 00:30:41,233
they cannot do anything.

475
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:43,817
Now if supposing somebody is spreading something,

476
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:45,358
they'll just stand like this, watch,

477
00:30:45,358 --> 00:30:47,358
they'll never put their hands to it.

478
00:30:47,358 --> 00:30:50,608
So for every Sahaja yogi it is important

479
00:30:50,608 --> 00:30:53,149
what we call as shramadaan.

480
00:30:54,608 --> 00:30:56,817
They have to do some shramadaan.

481
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,858
"Shramadaan" means the giving of some labor,

482
00:31:02,817 --> 00:31:05,358
and that is what we lack.

483
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:10,982
That even if it comes to that you'd better clean your house,

484
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:13,149
you'd better clean the outside of your house,

485
00:31:13,149 --> 00:31:15,608
try to put some garden around your house,

486
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:17,400
try to paint your house,

487
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,858
do some sort of a work with your hand

488
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:23,024
which even if you don't have anything,

489
00:31:23,024 --> 00:31:27,149
you can even brush your hair or something like that.

490
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:31,608
Whatever you think is the easiest you can start with,

491
00:31:31,608 --> 00:31:33,733
because I don't think people even do that.

492
00:31:34,233 --> 00:31:35,858
Even they don't shave themselves,

493
00:31:35,858 --> 00:31:38,358
they get the person to shave them - I mean,

494
00:31:38,358 --> 00:31:41,274
absolutely lazy lumps as they are.

495
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:44,274
Now, but on the contrary

496
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:47,233
we see in the West people use their hands.

497
00:31:47,525 --> 00:31:49,733
Because of that, you see,

498
00:31:49,982 --> 00:31:52,483
because they can use their hands, they are very collective.

499
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:55,733
So they score a point on being collective,

500
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:57,858
while the Indians score a point because

501
00:31:57,858 --> 00:31:59,775
they are Indians and they have a heritage

502
00:31:59,775 --> 00:32:00,982
and they know what is Kundalini,

503
00:32:00,982 --> 00:32:03,316
they know about Ganesha, they know everything.

504
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:05,525
So they score a point this side.

505
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:07,441
So it's the left side is the desire,

506
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:08,982
the right side is the action;

507
00:32:08,982 --> 00:32:11,858
again we come back to the same position where

508
00:32:11,858 --> 00:32:13,274
we have an imbalance,

509
00:32:13,274 --> 00:32:15,650
that the action takes place in the West,

510
00:32:15,982 --> 00:32:20,566
and here is only thinking - "all right, we'll do this"

511
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:23,441
- planning. Everything is a planning point.

512
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:27,066
Nothing works out. You go on planning, planning, planning.

513
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:29,733
Now we are building one single ashram

514
00:32:29,983 --> 00:32:33,400
in Delhi for the last, I think, ten years.

515
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:38,817
It is like Taj Mahal, I tell you!

516
00:32:42,692 --> 00:32:45,483
And it's so difficult, you see,

517
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,024
to understand why they have taken so much time

518
00:32:48,024 --> 00:32:50,483
when it's not a very big place, nothing.

519
00:32:50,942 --> 00:32:54,692
But it is not only the Sahaja yogis but other factors also,

520
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:57,817
because everybody is like that, everything is postponed,

521
00:32:58,191 --> 00:33:00,483
everything is to be done tomorrow.

522
00:33:00,483 --> 00:33:01,817
"This we will do tomorrow."

523
00:33:01,817 --> 00:33:04,817
Then one person will come, another person won't come.

524
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:09,483
Like we used to have in the school,

525
00:33:09,775 --> 00:33:15,775
we would get a sum like that or something to solve that,

526
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:18,983
see, there were: one house was built,

527
00:33:18,983 --> 00:33:22,233
three persons came to work and one ran away.

528
00:33:22,692 --> 00:33:26,441
Then two persons came to work and one stayed

529
00:33:26,441 --> 00:33:27,775
and two ran away;

530
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:32,024
and then five persons came to work and two persons ran away.

531
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:34,650
So how, when will the house be finished?

532
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,483
Never!

533
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:42,316
With such runaways it can never be finished.

534
00:33:42,316 --> 00:33:43,483
It's like that.

535
00:33:43,483 --> 00:33:46,650
So this is what, where we lack collectivity.

536
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,358
I was saying that all Indians must find out

537
00:33:49,775 --> 00:33:53,566
some place where they could go and plant something.

538
00:33:54,024 --> 00:33:56,066
Get hold of some sort of a place

539
00:33:56,358 --> 00:34:00,191
where they could go and plant some nice banyan trees,

540
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,441
water it together, work it out together.

541
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,983
Now the Indian women are that way better.

542
00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:09,024
They do lot of work as far as the cooking is concerned

543
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,441
and all that,

544
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:12,483
but the other part is missing.

545
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,692
The other part is intelligence,

546
00:34:14,942 --> 00:34:16,942
it's the other part is to think.

547
00:34:16,942 --> 00:34:19,566
Now if all the time what they are thinking,

548
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:22,775
"Oh, my husband likes this, I must cook this for him,"

549
00:34:22,775 --> 00:34:26,983
and now if the husband has to have a, say,

550
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:28,358
a lemon with his food.

551
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,775
Now there's no lemon in the house.

552
00:34:29,775 --> 00:34:32,024
This woman would run up and down all over the place

553
00:34:32,024 --> 00:34:33,900
to get the lemon for the husband,

554
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,775
otherwise he will not eat the food.

555
00:34:35,775 --> 00:34:36,483
Doesn't matter,

556
00:34:36,483 --> 00:34:38,358
once in a while if he doesn't eat it's all right.

557
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:43,817
But the women will try,

558
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:46,024
because you see they must keep their,

559
00:34:46,316 --> 00:34:47,483
they understand one thing

560
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:49,316
that you must keep their palate all right.

561
00:34:49,316 --> 00:34:51,775
Then they are quite sensible in India

562
00:34:51,983 --> 00:34:53,982
because here they're real tigers,

563
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:55,775
all the husbands are like tigers,

564
00:34:55,775 --> 00:34:58,066
so you have to keep them feeding; otherwise you see,

565
00:34:58,066 --> 00:35:00,692
God knows when the tiger will jump on you.

566
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,441
The other way round in England or America I've seen,

567
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:05,900
the husbands are like,

568
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,191
just like goats and the women are like tigers!

569
00:35:16,858 --> 00:35:19,692
And the Westernized Indian women also are like that,

570
00:35:20,066 --> 00:35:21,525
and when they go to West,

571
00:35:21,525 --> 00:35:24,775
even simple women I've seen they become like tigresses.

572
00:35:24,983 --> 00:35:27,858
Something surprising how they change immediately

573
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:30,650
to the position, even if they may not wear the jeans

574
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,900
and all those things,

575
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,525
but they become like that.

576
00:35:33,775 --> 00:35:37,233
So this imbalancing starts in a human being

577
00:35:37,233 --> 00:35:39,191
when he doesn't understand

578
00:35:39,191 --> 00:35:41,525
that you have to be a axis of the Mother Earth,

579
00:35:41,525 --> 00:35:45,274
and neither the Capricorn or the Cancer.

580
00:35:47,316 --> 00:35:50,108
This balance comes through our depth,

581
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,316
and that depth has to be improved.

582
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:57,858
Not through just by talking about it,

583
00:35:58,149 --> 00:36:00,024
by talking about Sahaja Yoga,

584
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:03,400
but actually seriously doing meditation,

585
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,149
actually seriously doing meditation.

586
00:36:10,108 --> 00:36:13,274
Secondly, we must do some collective work.

587
00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:16,525
Now we have in India, say, architects.

588
00:36:17,483 --> 00:36:20,149
They have never touched anything with their own hands.

589
00:36:20,149 --> 00:36:24,274
They are sitting and drawing, you see, that's all - finished.

590
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:26,483
Now after the drawing, do what you like.

591
00:36:26,483 --> 00:36:29,149
And now they have problems, practical problems,

592
00:36:29,483 --> 00:36:31,650
they cannot nail one nail.

593
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:36,692
All are what you call them as white-collar...

594
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:40,191
Absolutely useless for any handwork.

595
00:36:40,525 --> 00:36:42,983
They cannot do any handwork whatsoever.

596
00:36:43,316 --> 00:36:45,982
Even if they have to lift, say, one of these chairs

597
00:36:46,233 --> 00:36:49,233
and stretch them, they cannot do it, normally.

598
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:53,733
So under these circumstances one has to understand

599
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:58,191
that we come from a society which is absolutely ruinous

600
00:36:58,525 --> 00:37:01,316
as far as collectivity is concerned,

601
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:02,983
so let us be collective.

602
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:05,566
Let us try to do something collective.

603
00:37:05,982 --> 00:37:08,983
But the collectivity is so poor in India,

604
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:14,400
so poor that even they do not treat their wives nicely.

605
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,566
They'll not talk to their wife nicely,

606
00:37:17,566 --> 00:37:19,066
to their children nicely;

607
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:23,400
to them it is absolutely adharmic to be kind to their wives.

608
00:37:26,775 --> 00:37:29,775
Now the other side is that the Western people

609
00:37:29,775 --> 00:37:32,316
care so much for collectivity that

610
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,650
whatever it is they try to compromise,

611
00:37:34,982 --> 00:37:37,733
and try to keep the family life all right.

612
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:40,525
So it's the two extremes as we have.

613
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,900
Despite that somehow, thanks to the wisdom of Indian women,

614
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:47,982
the family life is going strong.

615
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:52,274
But if you see such men in England,

616
00:37:52,274 --> 00:37:55,108
I can tell you nobody will stand the nonsense

617
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:57,858
that Indian men do to their women here.

618
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:03,733
Absolutely, it cannot be forgiven the way they behave.

619
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:07,274
So the balance between the women and men:

620
00:38:07,566 --> 00:38:09,692
what is the axis, is the home.

621
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,233
Home is the axis.

622
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:15,316
In the home, what sort of talks you have?

623
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:17,066
What do you think about,

624
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:18,566
what is your problem?

625
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:20,441
Where is your attention,

626
00:38:20,775 --> 00:38:22,233
what do you discuss?

627
00:38:22,982 --> 00:38:24,775
That's very important to see.

628
00:38:25,191 --> 00:38:26,858
In that you'll find out

629
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:29,066
what is going on in the family.

630
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:31,733
Say you are talking ill of each other,

631
00:38:32,191 --> 00:38:35,441
if you are telling your child against your husband,

632
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:37,733
husband is telling the wife against,

633
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:41,316
telling the children about, against the,

634
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:46,108
against the husband, like that.

635
00:38:46,108 --> 00:38:47,817
If it is going on like that,

636
00:38:48,024 --> 00:38:49,108
then what happens,

637
00:38:49,108 --> 00:38:52,608
that there cannot be the axis which is all right.

638
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:54,817
The axis is love,

639
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,233
axis is love,

640
00:38:57,233 --> 00:39:00,942
but not exploitation nor spoiling - it's love.

641
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:05,024
In country like ours, you see, what is the axis we have?

642
00:39:05,483 --> 00:39:07,983
The axis of our country is adhyatma.

643
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:15,983
We have to now get over this hankering after money,

644
00:39:15,983 --> 00:39:19,191
development, this, that. First take to adhyatma.

645
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:24,775
If people get realization before they are developed,

646
00:39:24,775 --> 00:39:28,817
there won't be the problem of creating another America here.

647
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,149
We don't have to become communist,

648
00:39:31,149 --> 00:39:32,817
we don't have to do anything like that,

649
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:34,982
because communists are just the same as Americans,

650
00:39:34,982 --> 00:39:37,733
there's no difference at all in temperament.

651
00:39:38,608 --> 00:39:42,149
If an American is allowed to stay in Russia

652
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:44,358
he'll behave the same way as a Russian behaves,

653
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:46,024
and if a Russian is sent to America

654
00:39:46,024 --> 00:39:48,733
he behaves the same way as the Americans behave.

655
00:39:49,483 --> 00:39:51,149
There's no change at all.

656
00:39:51,149 --> 00:39:56,733
Now if the axis of adhyatma in any country

657
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,024
where a person achieves his spiritual ascent

658
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,982
is, becomes the most important thing and is achieved,

659
00:40:08,233 --> 00:40:10,274
then any amount of development,

660
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:12,525
any amount of all these things

661
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:16,608
cannot destroy that country,

662
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:18,233
cannot create wars.

663
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:20,149
There will be peace everywhere,

664
00:40:20,149 --> 00:40:22,149
there will be enjoyment everywhere.

665
00:40:22,149 --> 00:40:24,817
So on this day of Makar Sankrant

666
00:40:25,024 --> 00:40:27,733
let us say now the Sankrant is over,

667
00:40:27,982 --> 00:40:31,149
and we have to look forward to the new age

668
00:40:31,149 --> 00:40:38,733
of a new moon blessing us,

669
00:40:38,982 --> 00:40:42,024
and the great sun coming over

670
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:45,525
to give us all the energy we need,

671
00:40:46,274 --> 00:40:51,858
to celebrate the advent of the golden age of Sahaja Yoga.

672
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:53,982
May God bless you all.

673
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:03,650
Now for the puja,

674
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,692
the Makar Sankrant Puja is very little,

675
00:41:05,692 --> 00:41:09,525
it's the puja of the Surya Devata, I don't know ...

676
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:39,441
From the foreign country,

677
00:42:39,441 --> 00:42:43,274
who is going to stay after the

678
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:53,441
11th, that is on the 12th? On the 12th - after the 12th.

679
00:42:54,441 --> 00:43:00,358
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten ...

680
00:43:01,441 --> 00:43:06,316
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

681
00:43:06,983 --> 00:43:08,608
All right, let's put it,

682
00:43:08,608 --> 00:43:12,692
who is going to stay in Bombay after the 11th?

683
00:43:20,733 --> 00:43:22,900
When are these people going?

684
00:43:23,483 --> 00:43:26,358
Those who are going to stay in Bombay after the 11th,

685
00:43:26,942 --> 00:43:30,316
when are they going, when are you going?

686
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:35,983
You are coming to Pratishthan. All right.

687
00:43:36,358 --> 00:43:38,983
What about you, John?

688
00:43:52,983 --> 00:43:56,983
Do you want to stay here in Bombay,

689
00:43:56,983 --> 00:43:59,149
or you want to stay in Pratishthan?

690
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:05,942
I mean, there's no arrangements here,

691
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:10,316
so all those who are not going on the 11th or 12th,

692
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,233
like that, in the near future,

693
00:44:14,566 --> 00:44:17,441
how many are those who are going to stay longer?

694
00:44:26,942 --> 00:44:30,108
About thirty-four. How many men and how many ladies?

695
00:44:36,942 --> 00:44:41,024
So we have decided that the men can come to Pratishthan,

696
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:44,358
and the rest of the ladies can go to Alibagh.

697
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:47,608
The reason is Pratishthan is still extremely spartan.

698
00:44:48,149 --> 00:44:49,692
It's not meant for ladies at all,

699
00:44:49,692 --> 00:44:52,108
and I have only one room where I live.

700
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:55,108
So best thing would be to send all the ladies...

701
00:45:03,441 --> 00:45:05,233
Let them go to Alibagh,

702
00:45:05,608 --> 00:45:08,566
and let them pay for their stay in Alibagh

703
00:45:08,942 --> 00:45:12,775
to people who will be looking after them.

704
00:45:13,149 --> 00:45:15,108
Those who are coming to Pratishthan,

705
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:18,900
how many there are? The rest of the men, about fifty.

706
00:45:20,483 --> 00:45:21,817
Fifty, all right.

707
00:45:22,692 --> 00:45:26,316
So when are you going back with the whole thing?

708
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:33,441
You see, because it's such a liability, this work.

709
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,024
You can come to Pratishthan

710
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:37,024
if you want to take some photographs or things,

711
00:45:37,441 --> 00:45:39,608
but it's a liability for us because,

712
00:45:39,608 --> 00:45:41,942
you see, unless and until you go back,

713
00:45:42,149 --> 00:45:44,441
it will be a liability on our head all the time.

714
00:45:44,733 --> 00:45:46,566
So best thing is that you come to Pratishthan,

715
00:45:46,817 --> 00:45:49,149
do a little photography or whatever you want to do.

716
00:45:49,608 --> 00:45:51,775
And then you'd better book yourself,

717
00:45:52,024 --> 00:45:54,566
because this must go out of our country,

718
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,692
otherwise they're always on our head,

719
00:45:58,441 --> 00:45:59,983
and they are following us.

720
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,316
So I am sorry, but you'll have to go with this ...

721
00:46:03,858 --> 00:46:05,608
stuff that you are carrying.

722
00:46:05,982 --> 00:46:08,733
So we will have to do it in three, four days' time.

723
00:46:09,983 --> 00:46:12,733
You can finish the photography there,

724
00:46:12,982 --> 00:46:14,441
and you fix up your going.

725
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:17,650
So for all the ladies who are going to stay on,

726
00:46:18,149 --> 00:46:22,525
can go in Washi or can go to Alibagh.

727
00:46:22,982 --> 00:46:24,316
Alibagh is better...

728
00:46:27,233 --> 00:46:30,775
They can go to Alibagh and stay there in Alibagh,

729
00:46:30,983 --> 00:46:33,108
about thirteen or fourteen ladies...

730
00:46:45,483 --> 00:46:46,942
All right, so done.

731
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:50,191
Now let's ... Atharv, Ganesha ...

732
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:54,775
Twenty-one people from America have to go,

733
00:46:54,775 --> 00:46:57,316
so we'll try to finish the puja as soon as possible,

734
00:46:57,692 --> 00:46:59,566
and they can leave.
