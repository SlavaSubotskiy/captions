1
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:08,417
It is a very unique opportunity, I think,

2
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:11,875
for Me to meet you again in Bombay

3
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:15,541
when you are all leaving this country,

4
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:22,833
and this kind of a special type of a puja

5
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,833
that we are having today.

6
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:30,459
This is the puja done to the sun,

7
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:35,083
and is called as Makar Sankrant.

8
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:42,875
"Makar" is the tropic of Capricorn,

9
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,833
Capricorn is Makar.

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,500
So now the sun is moving from the tropic of Capricorn

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,042
towards the tropic of Cancer,

12
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,625
and is always a fixed date because it's a,

13
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,708
it has something to do with the sun.

14
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,833
This is the only date which is fixed in the Indian calendar,

15
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:06,000
because they have to deal with the sun.

16
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:07,875
But this time, I don't know why, what has happened

17
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,875
that they have put it on the fifteenth

18
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:12,625
of this month - it's always the fourteenth.

19
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:17,917
Now today is, they are changing,

20
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:23,417
I would say that the seasons are going to be changed.

21
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:29,958
We've got six months when this moves,

22
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:33,334
sun moves towards the southern hemisphere

23
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:37,958
and makes it warm, and it comes to the northern hemisphere

24
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:41,833
from tomorrow.

25
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:46,917
So today is the last day, which we say that

26
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:49,583
is the day which is the coldest day,

27
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:53,625
according to Indian understanding.

28
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,917
After this the heat will start growing

29
00:01:57,499 --> 00:02:01,833
and all the - we can do anything that is auspicious,

30
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:06,708
any auspicious things can be done after this puja is over,

31
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:09,042
during the summer-time.

32
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,541
Though it's very hot in summer,

33
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:15,375
still people wants the sun to rule us

34
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,292
and to give us warmth because,

35
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:23,417
because of him only all the fields and all the vegetables,

36
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:26,209
all the fruits, everything grows.

37
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:31,292
And that's why when the six months the sun is not here,

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,167
we call it as "Sankrant,"

39
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:35,459
meaning a "calamity" in a way.

40
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,334
That is when of course in the,

41
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:44,209
in the European countries or say in England or America,

42
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:49,541
it is a calamity at that time when the sun is not there.

43
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:54,875
But even here it is regarded as a time today,

44
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:58,459
it's the day that the end of the Sankrant,

45
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,000
means the end of the calamity is over.

46
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,083
And they give something sweet to eat

47
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,209
which is also mixed with sesame seeds,

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,499
because sesame seed is heat-giving.

49
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:17,375
So today being the coldest day they want to give sesame seed,

50
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,125
also want you to retain the heat

51
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,541
and to adjust yourself to the heat that's coming up.

52
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,541
This is all thought of in a way,

53
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,875
in a very gross level,

54
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,334
on a very gross level,

55
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:33,875
that we should keep the people warm enough.

56
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,083
Also it is said that

57
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:42,417
the warmth of love should be expressed at this time

58
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:45,625
for people, because it is the coldest day.

59
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,459
So they say that "We give you this special thing for you

60
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,541
to say something sweet" - that is "goad goad bola"

61
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,417
- means "you say something sweet to us."

62
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,125
And the people who live in warm countries are sweeter people

63
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,209
than the people who live in colder places,

64
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:06,083
because the nature is rather very unkind to them.

65
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,334
I don't blame them for their temperament,

66
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,083
because the nature is so unkind.

67
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:13,417
In India you can live anywhere:

68
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,250
you can live under a tree,

69
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,417
you can live in a forest,

70
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:20,666
anywhere you can live quite happily,

71
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:24,666
as long as there is water to drink and water to bathe.

72
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:28,791
And there's not such a problem as

73
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:31,708
we have to face in the other parts of the world,

74
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,833
where if you have to go out of the house

75
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:37,499
you take about fifteen, twenty minutes to dress yourself up.

76
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:39,417
Here you just can walk out of the house,

77
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:42,417
you can keep your houses open during the summer-time,

78
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,250
and there's no problem of any kind

79
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:47,417
as far as the nature is concerned.

80
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:52,125
Nature becomes very kind during summer-time here because

81
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:56,958
the trees are lush and lot of greenery,

82
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,250
people feel very happy during that time,

83
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:09,292
and all the activity becomes more with the sun's energy.

84
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:15,083
But in the West as you have seen that the sun is much less.

85
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:16,666
Because of that,

86
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,583
people keep more to their houses,

87
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,167
to artificial heating or other heatings,

88
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,500
and the doors are closed,

89
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,417
the hearts are closed,

90
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,499
and it's difficult for them to

91
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,500
communicate with other people.

92
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,833
As you go down south more in your countries also,

93
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,083
you'll find people are warmer,

94
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,292
simpler,

95
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:49,167
very hospitable.

96
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:54,541
With the sun you get the heart which is very open heart,

97
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:58,541
and a kind of a inviting heart.

98
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:02,250
Now if you see on the Sahaja Yoga style,

99
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:04,833
the sun line is the right side

100
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:08,334
and the moon, moon is the left side.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,499
On the moon line

102
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,042
one can desire but cannot act.

103
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,292
Apart from that, on the moon line

104
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:20,250
if you go too far it can be destructive.

105
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,375
Because if you sit in the house doing nothing

106
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:28,417
- and also these days there's unemployment, say for example,

107
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:33,250
no work - then you start thinking too much,

108
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,917
and this thinking is just the desire energy working out,

109
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:40,375
no action.

110
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,375
And without the action

111
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,958
this energy can become very destructive.

112
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:47,917
That is why we find that people,

113
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:49,917
they say that "empty mind,

114
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:55,917
empty mind is the devil's workshop."

115
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,125
Where people have, do not act,

116
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,791
when the action doesn't take place,

117
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,167
then it can be quite destructive...

118
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:16,666
So the whole situation is different

119
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,375
in a country which is warm,

120
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,708
and a country which is not warm.

121
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:24,917
But in a country where it is very warm also,

122
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:26,292
like Africa,

123
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:29,708
there are complications due to too much of heat.

124
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:35,833
Like we have the tropic of -

125
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,125
mean the equator passing through,

126
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,250
and it heats up that area so much

127
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,541
that it becomes full of jungles,

128
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,499
very high trees and tall trees;

129
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:53,499
and the whole place is covered with foliage so much

130
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:55,917
that there's no possibility

131
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:02,250
for any sunshine to penetrate through,

132
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:05,125
and it's quite dark,

133
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:06,791
it's full of darkness.

134
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:11,209
So that extreme also comes in the same category

135
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,000
as the extreme of the cold season.

136
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:16,209
Now such people live there

137
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:20,958
and they, naturally because the sun is less,

138
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,250
so they do not grow much;

139
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,334
and they can be primitive people

140
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,875
and they can be quite aggressive,

141
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,625
like they learn things from the animals

142
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,459
and they could be quite aggressive.

143
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,541
So the balance has to be struck,

144
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,791
and the balance is that,

145
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:47,250
that we should desire and act.

146
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:52,958
But the trouble is in human atmosphere

147
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,459
there is a division of labor, I think,

148
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:01,750
that one part of the country is thinking,

149
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,500
another part of the country is acting.

150
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:09,334
Under these circumstances nothing works out.

151
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,875
So a balance has to be struck where

152
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,417
you have the Sushumna working out.

153
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:20,875
Now the Sushumna Nadi is the one where

154
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:25,250
one would say is the equator - it's not,

155
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,625
is not the equator,

156
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:30,334
but is the axis of the Mother Earth.

157
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,666
Axis of the Mother Earth is the Sushumna,

158
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,666
and that has to act;

159
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,750
and when it comes to that axis then we should understand that we have to be on our axis.

160
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:44,666
So we are on the axis,it is the one that balances.

161
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:49,375
Actually there is, there is, there is nothing

162
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,250
like a big pole

163
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,375
inside the Mother Earth which we can call it as an axis.

164
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,583
There is nothing that is material

165
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,958
inside the Mother Earth that we can call it as an axis,

166
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,583
but it's the energy force

167
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,167
which acts in such a manner

168
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:10,917
that the Earth moves with such tremendous speed

169
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:14,250
when the cosmos is all spread out so much.

170
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:18,708
It not only moves but it creates day and night for us,

171
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:22,292
so that day-time we can work and night-time we can sleep,

172
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:23,958
to give us a balance.

173
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,499
Only also it moves in such a manner round the sun

174
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:35,042
that half of the countries get the sun

175
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:36,958
during the summer-time,

176
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,375
and half of them get it during the winter-time.

177
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,250
That's the axis that acts and works out everything.

178
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:46,417
Apart from that,

179
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:51,167
this axis keeps all the distances necessary

180
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:55,791
from other planets and other moving bodies in the cosmos.

181
00:10:56,167 --> 00:11:00,500
This axis is the intelligence of the Mother Earth.

182
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:06,583
It is not only the intelligence but it is the fragrance,

183
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:11,417
and apart from, it is the Sushumna Nadi,

184
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,500
you can say, of the Mother Earth.

185
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,958
Now through this axis only all these swayambhus

186
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:23,042
and all these great happenings of earthquakes

187
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:24,958
and all that takes place.

188
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:27,708
This axis is the one which moves.

189
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,791
It's an energy, we can call it axis as the energy,

190
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:35,666
moves the lava into different directions

191
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:43,708
and pierces through different areas to create earthquakes,

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,541
and also to have

193
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:54,209
... volcanoes, volcanoes.

194
00:11:54,541 --> 00:12:00,209
And all these things happen because the axis has sense

195
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:01,459
what is to be done.

196
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,541
This axis is the one that loves us.

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Because of this axis we,

198
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:10,209
we have seasons.

199
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:13,875
The seasons are created beautifully to give us

200
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,958
different, different varieties of food

201
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,459
and varieties of things.

202
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,459
The heat of the Mother Earth if it is lost,

203
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:28,000
then we'll have nothing on this Earth,

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,666
it'll be all frozen and there will be all snow,

205
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,541
and we'll have no food, nothing,

206
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,500
and it will be like moon living here.

207
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:41,666
Now it has been specially created:

208
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,625
first the Mother Earth when it was created

209
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,541
through the heat of the sun,

210
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:53,334
so we can say that the sun is the father of the Mother Earth.

211
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,541
Then she was brought very close to the moon

212
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,625
so it cooled down, absolutely it cooled down,

213
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,209
it was all snow.

214
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:06,125
Then it was brought closer to the sun

215
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:09,000
and moved at a point where

216
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,750
life could start working,

217
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,209
and that's how the whole thing was organized beautifully

218
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,417
to make life grow in that area.

219
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,625
Now when the life started growing,

220
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:25,334
gradually we know that how the carbon was formed.

221
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:28,917
Now the carbon is formed by the same axis,

222
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:31,125
because there's heat in the axis,

223
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,250
the energy of heat that converts

224
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:42,499
the plants into carbon.

225
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,375
Now this carbon is, later on

226
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,209
forms the basis for,

227
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:50,917
we can say,

228
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:57,499
for the production of carbohydrates,

229
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:58,750
you can say,

230
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,334
or all organic matter.

231
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:05,666
But to create life we had to have another help,

232
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,250
is the nitrogen;

233
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:10,791
and this nitrogen was also, you'll be surprised to know,

234
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:14,917
that was created by the same axis, by its movement.

235
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,791
And when it created this nitrogen,

236
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,500
the nitrogen gave us the amino acids;

237
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:24,209
and when the amino acids were created within us,

238
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:31,541
then we started our lives from amoeba and all that.

239
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:36,042
Of course this was done in the ocean,

240
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,083
because in the ocean with the movement,

241
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,499
nitrogen was created and life was created,

242
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,666
and then through the ocean it's emitted out,

243
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:48,917
and that's how we have amino acids.

244
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,625
With the amino acids, the formation of amino acids

245
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,625
gave us the combinations and permutations,

246
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:56,917
different lives.

247
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,209
So in the whole evolutionary process

248
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:04,209
the Mother Earth has played a very big part through her axis.

249
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,666
In the same way in human beings,

250
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:09,791
the axis is the most important thing.

251
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,250
That's the main principle of life we have got, is our axis.

252
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,917
We have to stand on our axis.

253
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,750
Those who do not stand on their axis,

254
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,125
stand more towards the left or towards the right,

255
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:27,666
are capable of complete destruction;

256
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,791
because either they will be destroyed by

257
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:34,541
too much of right side or too much of left side.

258
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:39,375
So our axis has to be properly dealt with.

259
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,625
Now those people who do not have a proper axis

260
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,000
can have problems of different chakras,

261
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:51,750
of different kind of quality in a person.

262
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,958
A person who stretches his axis too much,

263
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,000
puts back his head like this,

264
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,250
is a person who is very right-sided

265
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,958
and creates problem with his ego;

266
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,334
and the one who absolutely bends down

267
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:10,250
like a slavish person also is a person

268
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,791
who goes towards his destructiveness.

269
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:17,666
Now there's a big problem between these two types of people,

270
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
one trying to dominate another,

271
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,250
and when they start dominating another person

272
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,375
they actually destroy themselves,

273
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:29,417
as well as destroy the ones whom they are dominating.

274
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:30,750
For example now,

275
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,250
we have seen that we had

276
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,334
Britishers who came here and ruled us.

277
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,875
We have seen the French went and ruled some other people,

278
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,708
then there are Portuguese who went and ruled

279
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:44,958
some other people.

280
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:47,875
But everything that they did to dominate

281
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,958
and all that has double reactions.

282
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,541
First of all by their domination, say,

283
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,625
Indians became very slavish,

284
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,209
Indians became - even today they are extremely slavish,

285
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,083
and they do not have that independent axis

286
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,334
as they should have.

287
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:04,625
Extremely slavish people they are.

288
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,833
I mean, especially I've seen in the West,

289
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,125
I am surprised when the Indians go from here,

290
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,209
I find they are so very slavish.

291
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,666
They try to sort of do all kinds of slavish acts

292
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,417
to please the white-skinned people.

293
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:24,500
The white skin became sort of a very adorable stuff in India.

294
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,875
That added to the ego of the whites,

295
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,209
added to the ego of the whites,

296
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:34,417
and today you see what's happening is

297
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,500
all that ego is destroying them.

298
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,958
They are on the verge of destruction because of their ego.

299
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:43,541
So it is so unnatural and it is so superficial.

300
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:47,125
One has to understand that what is the best

301
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,500
within a human being is his axis,

302
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,459
and everybody has an axis,

303
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:55,125
and one must respect the axis of every person.

304
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,500
In Sahaja Yoga I don't know you by your faces so much;

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,209
I know you by your chakras,

306
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:03,459
by your Sushumna,

307
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,083
what sort of a Sushumna you have.

308
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,459
If you have a deep Sushumna, I know you as a deep person.

309
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,875
If you have a superficial Sushumna,

310
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,292
I know you as a person with a very superficial

311
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,500
type of a Sushumna.

312
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,958
And even if you make up something

313
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:24,417
by sort of being very nice or good,

314
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,625
or talking about Sahaja Yoga

315
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,875
or knowing too much about Sahaja Yoga,

316
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:33,083
and saying things which will baffle normally anyone

317
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:35,459
as if you are masters of Sahaja Yoga,

318
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:37,500
I know how deep you are.

319
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,541
So the depth on the axis

320
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,875
is more important than anything else.

321
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,625
Your axis has to be very deep.

322
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,375
Now you will say that "Mother,

323
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:52,666
the axis is the same as it is, so how can it be deep?"

324
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:57,125
So the, in the axis as you see is made in human beings,

325
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:02,875
is like a three-and-a-half coiled paper-like thing,

326
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,000
and the inside of it is the Brahma Nadi.

327
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,500
The Brahma Nadi is a very, very small little,

328
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:14,875
we can call a very, very hair-like thing

329
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:19,875
where only a hair-like Kundalini can pass through.

330
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,958
But when the person is deep this Brahma Nadi is bigger,

331
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:25,666
and all the rest of them

332
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:30,625
which are coiled into each otherare smaller;

333
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,541
while the people who are not deep, their outside

334
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:39,666
what you call the foldings are bigger

335
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,541
than the inside small thing.

336
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:46,459
Now such people could be apparently very dynamic,

337
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:49,334
may look very intelligent, may look very smart,

338
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,500
may look to be very good-looking

339
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,750
or whatever it may be outwardly,

340
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,125
but inwardly they are not deep.

341
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,500
Inwardly if they are deep,

342
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,375
their whole attitude is beautiful.

343
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,666
They are very joy-giving people,

344
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:07,791
they are very joy-giving.

345
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:12,500
And the more if you meet a person of another kind

346
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,958
he may look joyous, he may try to give you joy,

347
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:19,334
but the joy won't be really that deep;

348
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,083
it would be like a joy-killing.

349
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:28,500
So it is important for us to make our axis deeper,

350
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:33,334
and that is where we lack the proper assiduity,

351
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:38,000
the proper effort we have to put in.

352
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:43,666
Now some people have automatically a very deep axis,

353
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:49,334
and some people have very, very what you should say,

354
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:54,334
a very constricted type of the axis.

355
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,000
This axis has to be grown.

356
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,375
Now when you come for My puja and all that

357
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,250
I do expand it, I agree,

358
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,000
but it is temporary thing.

359
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:10,083
To retain it at that point one has to work at home,

360
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:12,334
in the collective also.

361
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:17,541
One has to work very much at home with meditation.

362
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,541
But it should be done seriously.

363
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,750
It should not be just a joke,

364
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,334
to be frivolous,

365
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,000
to be stupid - that's not the way.

366
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,875
It should be done very seriously, in the meaning

367
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,666
that it is a devoted task you have taken,

368
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,875
it's a meditative thing;

369
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,125
it's a prayer to God we can call it,

370
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,125
it's a puja to God.

371
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,500
Is to be done with that reverence,

372
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:53,750
because reverence is the key of achievement.

373
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,000
If you have no reverence about yourself

374
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,791
and no reverence of others,

375
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,750
then it cannot be done.

376
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,250
But first you must have reverence for your own life.

377
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,083
"What am I doing with my life?

378
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,375
Where am I wasting it?

379
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,500
Why should I waste it?

380
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,666
Why shouldn't I be deep?

381
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,750
After all, there must be some purpose of my life.

382
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,500
Am I serving my purpose, am I doing that?"

383
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:20,292
All these things if they pop into your head,

384
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:24,292
then you will understand it's very easy to fight out your ego,

385
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,708
because normally on small, small things people fight.

386
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:31,875
I've seen that in Sahaja Yoga also people fight on things

387
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:35,625
like, I mean which are so useless, absolutely useless.

388
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:39,583
To Me it sounds stupid to even mention

389
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:42,500
the way people fight over small things and quarrel.

390
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:46,292
But a deep person, even if he doesn't speak much,

391
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,459
even if he doesn't show off much,

392
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:52,292
even if he doesn't sit in the front line,

393
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,167
he expresses himself through his depth,

394
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:58,083
because I can work out better through that.

395
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,500
So to develop this one must meditate,

396
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
important thing is to meditate;

397
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,250
every day, every day, every day.

398
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,250
You may not eat your food one day,

399
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,750
you may not sleep one day,

400
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,791
you may not go to your office one day,

401
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,958
you may not do anything that you are doing every day

402
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,125
- but you must meditate every day.

403
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,750
That's an important point,

404
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:27,459
to develop the central constricted part into a bigger area.

405
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:35,750
Now when that happens that you start developing it,

406
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,417
the first thing you will notice about yourself

407
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,500
that you do not care for any comfort,

408
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:44,875
you're not bothered about any,

409
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:48,917
any material thing.

410
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,666
Whatever it is you are above it,

411
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,917
you just don't bother your head - let it be.

412
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,541
You just don't want to put your neck

413
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:59,791
into a thing where you do not belong.

414
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,625
You just get out of it,

415
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,167
and you think that

416
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:07,417
"Oh God, this is too much for me, I just don't care for it."

417
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:10,958
So your whole attention now moves inward.

418
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:13,375
When the attention starts moving inward

419
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,375
then it expands more.

420
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,833
It's the inner part which is called as the Brahma Nadi,

421
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:23,708
and starts expanding and expanding.

422
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:26,500
Now in small, small things also:

423
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,417
say for example

424
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:32,541
if I have not mentioned somebody

425
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:35,459
and mentioned somebody else,

426
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,000
then they feel,

427
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,375
"Oh, why didn't Mother mention my name?"

428
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:44,000
It's too small a thing that it doesn't matter.

429
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,209
As long as you have a deep axis you are with Me,

430
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:52,541
I am with you, absolutely one with each other.

431
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:55,167
But these outward things are,

432
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:57,417
"Oh, She gave a nice sari to another one,

433
00:24:57,417 --> 00:24:59,750
She never gave us a sari, She didn't do this,

434
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,000
didn't do that."

435
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,500
All those things if it comes to your head,

436
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,334
that means absolutely it's true

437
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:10,000
that there is something lacking in you.

438
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,583
Or if you try to complain,

439
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:15,292
"Oh, I went there, I had to go by a bus

440
00:25:15,292 --> 00:25:17,292
and I had to stand on this thing,"

441
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:19,958
that shows that you are not comforted at all.

442
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:24,750
This widening comforts you.

443
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:27,417
That's the comforting thing,

444
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:30,958
and that really makes you feel so comfortable

445
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:36,417
in any circumstance, in any position, in any lifestyle,

446
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:42,625
and you do not want to have any other comfort.

447
00:25:45,334 --> 00:25:47,833
And this one has to develop,

448
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,833
through meditative effort.

449
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:54,042
Secondly is, we have to know that Sahaja Yoga

450
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:56,625
as it is today is a collective happening.

451
00:25:57,459 --> 00:26:00,334
I find especially among Indian men,

452
00:26:00,334 --> 00:26:02,541
they never do any work with their hands,

453
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:03,958
which is a wrong thing.

454
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:06,750
Because they don't use their hands at all

455
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
their collectivity is poor, very poor.

456
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,334
Indians have the worst collectivity.

457
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:13,500
If you have an ashram,

458
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,167
I don't know why should we build the ashram,

459
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:16,833
nobody is going to stay there.

460
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:20,167
They want to have their own houses,

461
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:21,499
their own families,

462
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:23,083
their own children;

463
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:25,833
they are the worst of all for collectivity.

464
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:29,833
The reason is, Indian men never do any work with their hands.

465
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:34,292
They cannot nail one nail - there are many like that

466
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,042
- leave alone repairing anything.

467
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:41,167
They will stand with their hands on their hips

468
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:45,167
and would just tell work to other people, you see.

469
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,083
There's a Marathi saying,

470
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:49,875
a very interesting ....

471
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:57,459
that is, "To sit on a camel and to drive the goats."

472
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:01,541
So that is very typical of Indian men.

473
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:03,209
They cannot repair anything,

474
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:04,750
they cannot do anything.

475
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,334
Now if supposing somebody is spreading something,

476
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,875
they'll just stand like this, watch,

477
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:10,875
they'll never put their hands to it.

478
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:14,125
So for every Sahaja yogi it is important

479
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:16,666
what we call as shramadaan.

480
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:20,334
They have to do some shramadaan.

481
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:24,375
"Shramadaan" means the giving of some labor,

482
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:28,875
and that is what we lack.

483
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:34,499
That even if it comes to that you'd better clean your house,

484
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:36,666
you'd better clean the outside of your house,

485
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:39,125
try to put some garden around your house,

486
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:40,917
try to paint your house,

487
00:27:40,917 --> 00:27:43,375
do some sort of a work with your hand

488
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:46,541
which even if you don't have anything,

489
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:50,666
you can even brush your hair or something like that.

490
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:55,125
Whatever you think is the easiest you can start with,

491
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,250
because I don't think people even do that.

492
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,375
Even they don't shave themselves,

493
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,875
they get the person to shave them - I mean,

494
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:04,791
absolutely lazy lumps as they are.

495
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:07,791
Now, but on the contrary

496
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:10,750
we see in the West people use their hands.

497
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:13,250
Because of that, you see,

498
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:16,000
because they can use their hands, they are very collective.

499
00:28:16,292 --> 00:28:19,250
So they score a point on being collective,

500
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,375
while the Indians score a point because

501
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,292
they are Indians and they have a heritage

502
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:24,499
and they know what is Kundalini,

503
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:26,833
they know about Ganesha, they know everything.

504
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,042
So they score a point this side.

505
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,958
So it's the left side is the desire,

506
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:32,499
the right side is the action;

507
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:35,375
again we come back to the same position where

508
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:36,791
we have an imbalance,

509
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:39,167
that the action takes place in the West,

510
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:44,083
and here is only thinking - "all right, we'll do this"

511
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:46,958
- planning. Everything is a planning point.

512
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:50,583
Nothing works out. You go on planning, planning, planning.

513
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:53,250
Now we are building one single ashram

514
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,917
in Delhi for the last, I think, ten years.

515
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:02,334
It is like Taj Mahal, I tell you!

516
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:09,000
And it's so difficult, you see,

517
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,541
to understand why they have taken so much time

518
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,000
when it's not a very big place, nothing.

519
00:29:14,459 --> 00:29:18,209
But it is not only the Sahaja yogis but other factors also,

520
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,334
because everybody is like that, everything is postponed,

521
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:24,000
everything is to be done tomorrow.

522
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,334
"This we will do tomorrow."

523
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:28,334
Then one person will come, another person won't come.

524
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:33,000
Like we used to have in the school,

525
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:39,292
we would get a sum like that or something to solve that,

526
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:42,500
see, there were: one house was built,

527
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,750
three persons came to work and one ran away.

528
00:29:46,209 --> 00:29:49,958
Then two persons came to work and one stayed

529
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,292
and two ran away;

530
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:55,541
and then five persons came to work and two persons ran away.

531
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:58,167
So how, when will the house be finished?

532
00:29:58,417 --> 00:30:00,000
Never!

533
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:05,833
With such runaways it can never be finished.

534
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,000
It's like that.

535
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,167
So this is what, where we lack collectivity.

536
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:12,875
I was saying that all Indians must find out

537
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:17,083
some place where they could go and plant something.

538
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,583
Get hold of some sort of a place

539
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,708
where they could go and plant some nice banyan trees,

540
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,958
water it together, work it out together.

541
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,500
Now the Indian women are that way better.

542
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,541
They do lot of work as far as the cooking is concerned

543
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:33,958
and all that,

544
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,000
but the other part is missing.

545
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,209
The other part is intelligence,

546
00:30:38,459 --> 00:30:40,459
it's the other part is to think.

547
00:30:40,459 --> 00:30:43,083
Now if all the time what they are thinking,

548
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:46,292
"Oh, my husband likes this, I must cook this for him,"

549
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:50,500
and now if the husband has to have a, say,

550
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,875
a lemon with his food.

551
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:53,292
Now there's no lemon in the house.

552
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:55,541
This woman would run up and down all over the place

553
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,417
to get the lemon for the husband,

554
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:59,292
otherwise he will not eat the food.

555
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:00,000
Doesn't matter,

556
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,875
once in a while if he doesn't eat it's all right.

557
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:07,334
But the women will try,

558
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:09,541
because you see they must keep their,

559
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,000
they understand one thing

560
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,833
that you must keep their palate all right.

561
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:15,292
Then they are quite sensible in India

562
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,499
because here they're real tigers,

563
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:19,292
all the husbands are like tigers,

564
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:21,583
so you have to keep them feeding; otherwise you see,

565
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:24,209
God knows when the tiger will jump on you.

566
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,958
The other way round in England or America I've seen,

567
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:29,417
the husbands are like,

568
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:32,708
just like goats and the women are like tigers!

569
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:43,209
And the Westernized Indian women also are like that,

570
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:45,042
and when they go to West,

571
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:48,292
even simple women I've seen they become like tigresses.

572
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,375
Something surprising how they change immediately

573
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:54,167
to the position, even if they may not wear the jeans

574
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:55,417
and all those things,

575
00:31:55,417 --> 00:31:57,042
but they become like that.

576
00:31:57,292 --> 00:32:00,750
So this imbalancing starts in a human being

577
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,708
when he doesn't understand

578
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:05,042
that you have to be a axis of the Mother Earth,

579
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:08,791
and neither the Capricorn or the Cancer.

580
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:13,625
This balance comes through our depth,

581
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:15,833
and that depth has to be improved.

582
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:21,375
Not through just by talking about it,

583
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:23,541
by talking about Sahaja Yoga,

584
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,917
but actually seriously doing meditation,

585
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:29,666
actually seriously doing meditation.

586
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:36,791
Secondly, we must do some collective work.

587
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:40,042
Now we have in India, say, architects.

588
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,666
They have never touched anything with their own hands.

589
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:47,791
They are sitting and drawing, you see, that's all - finished.

590
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,000
Now after the drawing, do what you like.

591
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,666
And now they have problems, practical problems,

592
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,167
they cannot nail one nail.

593
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:00,209
All are what you call them as white-collar...

594
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,708
Absolutely useless for any handwork.

595
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:06,500
They cannot do any handwork whatsoever.

596
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,499
Even if they have to lift, say, one of these chairs

597
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,750
and stretch them, they cannot do it, normally.

598
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:17,250
So under these circumstances one has to understand

599
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,708
that we come from a society which is absolutely ruinous

600
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,833
as far as collectivity is concerned,

601
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,500
so let us be collective.

602
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:29,083
Let us try to do something collective.

603
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:32,500
But the collectivity is so poor in India,

604
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,917
so poor that even they do not treat their wives nicely.

605
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,083
They'll not talk to their wife nicely,

606
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,583
to their children nicely;

607
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:46,917
to them it is absolutely adharmic to be kind to their wives.

608
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:53,292
Now the other side is that the Western people

609
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:55,833
care so much for collectivity that

610
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,167
whatever it is they try to compromise,

611
00:33:58,499 --> 00:34:01,250
and try to keep the family life all right.

612
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,042
So it's the two extremes as we have.

613
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:09,417
Despite that somehow, thanks to the wisdom of Indian women,

614
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,499
the family life is going strong.

615
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:15,791
But if you see such men in England,

616
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:18,625
I can tell you nobody will stand the nonsense

617
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:21,375
that Indian men do to their women here.

618
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:27,250
Absolutely, it cannot be forgiven the way they behave.

619
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:30,791
So the balance between the women and men:

620
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:33,209
what is the axis, is the home.

621
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:35,750
Home is the axis.

622
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:38,833
In the home, what sort of talks you have?

623
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:40,583
What do you think about,

624
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,083
what is your problem?

625
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:43,958
Where is your attention,

626
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:45,750
what do you discuss?

627
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:48,292
That's very important to see.

628
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:50,375
In that you'll find out

629
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,583
what is going on in the family.

630
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:55,250
Say you are talking ill of each other,

631
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:58,958
if you are telling your child against your husband,

632
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,250
husband is telling the wife against,

633
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:04,833
telling the children about, against the,

634
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,625
against the husband, like that.

635
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,334
If it is going on like that,

636
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:12,625
then what happens,

637
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:16,125
that there cannot be the axis which is all right.

638
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:18,334
The axis is love,

639
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,750
axis is love,

640
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:24,459
but not exploitation nor spoiling - it's love.

641
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:28,541
In country like ours, you see, what is the axis we have?

642
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,500
The axis of our country is adhyatma.

643
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:39,500
We have to now get over this hankering after money,

644
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,708
development, this, that. First take to adhyatma.

645
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:48,292
If people get realization before they are developed,

646
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:52,334
there won't be the problem of creating another America here.

647
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,666
We don't have to become communist,

648
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:56,334
we don't have to do anything like that,

649
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:58,499
because communists are just the same as Americans,

650
00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:01,250
there's no difference at all in temperament.

651
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:05,666
If an American is allowed to stay in Russia

652
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:07,875
he'll behave the same way as a Russian behaves,

653
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,541
and if a Russian is sent to America

654
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:12,250
he behaves the same way as the Americans behave.

655
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,666
There's no change at all.

656
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:20,250
Now if the axis of adhyatma in any country

657
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:25,541
where a person achieves his spiritual ascent

658
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:31,499
is, becomes the most important thing and is achieved,

659
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,791
then any amount of development,

660
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:36,042
any amount of all these things

661
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:40,125
cannot destroy that country,

662
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,750
cannot create wars.

663
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,666
There will be peace everywhere,

664
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:45,666
there will be enjoyment everywhere.

665
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:48,334
So on this day of Makar Sankrant

666
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:51,250
let us say now the Sankrant is over,

667
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:54,666
and we have to look forward to the new age

668
00:36:54,666 --> 00:37:02,250
of a new moon blessing us,

669
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:05,541
and the great sun coming over

670
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,042
to give us all the energy we need,

671
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:15,375
to celebrate the advent of the golden age of Sahaja Yoga.

672
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,499
May God bless you all.

673
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:27,167
Now for the puja,

674
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:29,209
the Makar Sankrant Puja is very little,

675
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:33,042
it's the puja of the Surya Devata, I don't know ...

676
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,958
From the foreign country,

677
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:06,791
who is going to stay after the

678
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:16,958
11th, that is on the 12th? On the 12th - after the 12th.

679
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:23,875
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten ...

680
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:29,833
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

681
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,125
All right, let's put it,

682
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:36,209
who is going to stay in Bombay after the 11th?

683
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,417
When are these people going?

684
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,875
Those who are going to stay in Bombay after the 11th,

685
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:53,833
when are they going, when are you going?

686
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:59,500
You are coming to Pratishthan. All right.

687
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:02,500
What about you, John?

688
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Do you want to stay here in Bombay,

689
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,666
or you want to stay in Pratishthan?

690
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:29,459
I mean, there's no arrangements here,

691
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:33,833
so all those who are not going on the 11th or 12th,

692
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:36,750
like that, in the near future,

693
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:40,958
how many are those who are going to stay longer?

694
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:53,625
About thirty-four. How many men and how many ladies?

695
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:04,541
So we have decided that the men can come to Pratishthan,

696
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,875
and the rest of the ladies can go to Alibagh.

697
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:11,125
The reason is Pratishthan is still extremely spartan.

698
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:13,209
It's not meant for ladies at all,

699
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:15,625
and I have only one room where I live.

700
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:18,625
So best thing would be to send all the ladies...

701
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:28,750
Let them go to Alibagh,

702
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:32,083
and let them pay for their stay in Alibagh

703
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:36,292
to people who will be looking after them.

704
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:38,625
Those who are coming to Pratishthan,

705
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:42,417
how many there are? The rest of the men, about fifty.

706
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,334
Fifty, all right.

707
00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:49,833
So when are you going back with the whole thing?

708
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:56,958
You see, because it's such a liability, this work.

709
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:58,541
You can come to Pratishthan

710
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:00,541
if you want to take some photographs or things,

711
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:03,125
but it's a liability for us because,

712
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:05,459
you see, unless and until you go back,

713
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:07,958
it will be a liability on our head all the time.

714
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,083
So best thing is that you come to Pratishthan,

715
00:42:10,334 --> 00:42:12,666
do a little photography or whatever you want to do.

716
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:15,292
And then you'd better book yourself,

717
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:18,083
because this must go out of our country,

718
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:20,209
otherwise they're always on our head,

719
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:23,500
and they are following us.

720
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,833
So I am sorry, but you'll have to go with this ...

721
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:29,125
stuff that you are carrying.

722
00:42:29,499 --> 00:42:32,250
So we will have to do it in three, four days' time.

723
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,250
You can finish the photography there,

724
00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:37,958
and you fix up your going.

725
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,167
So for all the ladies who are going to stay on,

726
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:46,042
can go in Washi or can go to Alibagh.

727
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:47,833
Alibagh is better...

728
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,292
They can go to Alibagh and stay there in Alibagh,

729
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,625
about thirteen or fourteen ladies...

730
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,459
All right, so done.

731
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:13,708
Now let's ... Atharv, Ganesha ...

732
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:18,292
Twenty-one people from America have to go,

733
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:20,833
so we'll try to finish the puja as soon as possible,

734
00:43:21,209 --> 00:43:23,083
and they can leave.
