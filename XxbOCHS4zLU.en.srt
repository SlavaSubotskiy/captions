1
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,000
I talk to them in Marathi language,  because here

2
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,600
so many of them don´t understand any other language but Marathi.

3
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,960
Today is the day of Gauri Puja.

4
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,160
Gauri is the one who, as a Virgin, created Shri Ganesha.

5
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,080
And in the same pattern you have got your realization.

6
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,880
In the same pattern!

7
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,360
So you have to use the same power within you that is of Gauri,

8
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,520
that you keep your heart clean. You must have a clean heart.

9
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,960
You must have a clean thinking.

10
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,080
There should be purity in your mind.

11
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,880
Of course, the bhakti does  give that purity,

12
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,240
but if there is anything lingering in your mind

13
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,920
I have to tell you there are three things

14
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,680
that are going to happen from today.

15
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,360
First, we have started Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

16
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,280
You are under the

17
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,840
vision of Shri Ganesh,

18
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,680
under the guidance of your Spirit,

19
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,120
and under the blessings of God Almighty.

20
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,800
But be careful, because once you become that,

21
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,320
you have to keep to that Dharma, you have to be honest about it.

22
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,480
If you are dishonest from today onwards

23
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,600
you be careful, anything can happen to you

24
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,999
if you get out of the maryadas.

25
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,800
Till you keep the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga, saying morning,

26
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,440
evening, night that: “I am a Sahaja Yogi”,

27
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,680
nobody can harm you, hurt you. Nobody can trouble you.

28
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,440
On the contrary you will be enjoying life

29
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,120
if you keep to the maryadas.

30
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,999
But if you leave the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga,

31
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,600
you will have big problems.

32
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,560
So this is the second thing I want to tell you

33
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,120
that today we have started the great vision,

34
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,640
which was promised long time back of realized souls.

35
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,080
Now the third is that

36
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,320
with all these things we are doing,

37
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,920
we must promise to God also

38
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
that we will know about Sahaja Yoga,

39
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,320
through proper understanding, reading every word of it.

40
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,480
We'll master the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

41
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,800
We’ll keep ourselves clean.

42
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:41,040
And completely surrender our lives to Sahaja Yoga.

43
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,320
This is what you have to promise in your heart.

44
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,640
Surrendering to Sahaja Yoga is actually surrendering to joy,

45
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,360
bliss and peace.

46
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:56,200
In that you are the gainer, nobody is a loser in it.

47
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,280
This is how today we have to decide once for all.

48
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,120
Today is the day as you know, my forefathers

49
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,760
called it the first day of the year(*).

50
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,000
and they have the kailasha and the shawl of the Goddess

51
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,720
as the emblem

52
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,360
or you can call it as a flag of Shalivahan.

53
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,560
In any way my delay is important because

54
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,120
there was Amavasya (last lunar day of dark fortnight) earlier,

55
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,240
and we had to get rid of that Amavasya for the first day to start.

56
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,400
That's how the delay was there,

57
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,240
there was jam, everything is arranged.

58
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,880
We should not worry: “Why there is delay, why there is this?”

59
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,120
Sometimes I may come earlier, I may come later, it's all arranged.

60
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,400
Because during Amavasya how can you have my puja?

61
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,520
Simple thing like that. It is all arranged, it's all worked out.

62
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,920
Everything is fine, just be your Self.

63
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,240
Do not get upset with anything, do not get worried or anything.

64
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,160
Just try to keep absolutely peaceful.

65
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,360
I´ll  give you some tests by seeing

66
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,240
how much you keep to that situation,

67
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,560
of complete peace within yourself.

68
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,360
If you have done no wrong, if you are a Sahaja yogi,

69
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,560
there should be no disturbance.

70
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,040
If others have done wrong, it's alright,

71
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,360
doesn't matter, you have not done anything wrong

72
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,200
As long as you have done no wrong there is nothing to worry.

73
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,800
And as it is, even if you have done some wrong,

74
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,640
God is there to forgive you.

75
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,960
So don't have any worry, nothing. Have all the strength,

76
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,520
have all the courage and go ahead with this promise onwards.

77
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,720
Because I see now Sahaja Yoga is going to take a new turn.

78
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,840
Definitely it is going to take.

79
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,720
We are going to come up to a stage

80
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,960
where thousands and thousands will join hands.

81
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,320
But first of all those who are in the foundations,

82
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,840
who are the first people

83
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,640
must work very hard to keep themselves above

84
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,320
all kinds of foolish temptations

85
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,960
all kinds of foolish things you have been doing,

86
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,880
which is asahaja (not Sahaja).

87
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,440
Language should be sweet, your behavior should be good,

88
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,600
it should be very gentle and soft.

89
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,520
You should move like a yogi, live like a saint,

90
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,920
and people should see through you the greatness of Sahaja Yoga.

91
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,800
May God bless you!
