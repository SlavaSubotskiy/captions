1
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:40,290
Today, we are going to worship Shri Krishna.
See how cold it was about three o'clock. Now

2
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:04,620
the reason is this, that Shri Krishna did
little mischief with Indra. Indra, who is

3
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:18,450
a God, or you can call semi-God, for looking
after the rain. So, Indra got very angry.

4
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:29,870
You see all such semi-Gods are very sensitive
people, at the smallest thing they get angry

5
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:43,970
and irritated and they start using their powers
to express their anger. So he started pouring

6
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:56,830
rain on all the gopas and Shri Krishna, who
were looking after the cows. And the rain

7
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:14,250
was so heavy that they thought that the whole
land will be completely submerged. So Indra

8
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:34,060
was very happy to spoil the game of Shri Krishna,
and he thought he was very successful. So,

9
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:00,900
Shri Krishna lifted a mountain on His finger,
and all these people who were getting drowned,

10
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:17,860
went under that mountain. This is Shri Krishna's
style. My style is different. I told Indra

11
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:33,920
that you can't misbehave with me, you can't.
So far I've not harmed you in any way and

12
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,800
I've not irritated you. Of course it's going
to be Shri Krishna's Puja, but that doesn't

13
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:53,950
mean that you should try to show off your
powers before me. Sometimes I wonder these

14
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:05,170
Devas - Semi-Gods, they are realized souls
or not, because why do they get angry like

15
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:14,300
this for small things. Whatever it is, he
could be reconciled and now it's become warm,

16
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,060
I must say.

17
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:36,010
With Sahaja Yoga you can do many many things,
but you must know what you can do. For that,

18
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Krishna is a very good example. He started
Sahaj culture. Culture, I'm saying - He didn't

19
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:05,860
give realization to anyone, but He gave the
idea of Sahaj culture. How? - Before him came

20
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:19,069
Shri Ram, who was Maryada Purushotama, who
was a man very particular about everything.

21
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:32,459
I mean, like He threw out His wife because
He was a king and a king cannot have a scandal,

22
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:43,649
especially from His wife. So He threw Her
out - it was not Kali Yuga, that's why. And

23
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:55,930
His father ordered him to go, not only His
father so much as His stepmother, to go in

24
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:07,610
an exile into a forest. So He agreed, after
all He was Maryada Purushotama. So whatever

25
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:20,990
His father said, He agreed, whatever His mother
said, He agreed, and went into the forest,

26
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:31,579
stayed there fourteen years. This is the obedience
to the father. There was no need, His father

27
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:43,350
was not God. He was God, but in those days
it was important to make people, not only

28
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:58,329
respect the parents but also to obey them,
that was the time. In His time there were

29
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:10,290
many munis, and many saints and many also
hatha yogis. And these, even before him, used

30
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:24,069
to make people practice very strict type of
discipline and if they did not practice the

31
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:36,730
discipline, they had to do a lot of penance.
And, so many people who tried also, never

32
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:46,350
reached the goal, because of the strictness
and complete discipline about following 
the path of spirituality.

33
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:08,540
Recently I was reading a book called "Peaceful
Warrior". There they have described an American

34
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:16,639
seeking the truth, and the guru of that fellow
really really takes him to such a horrible

35
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:25,809
severe task - that my granddaughter said,
I am very angry with such a Guru, she couldn't

36
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:33,939
bear it. So ultimately he finds that he is
the existence.

37
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:43,639
So that was the practice followed after Shri
Rama. People would leave their wives, children,

38
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:52,100
go to Himalayas and sit there and practice
meditation. It was a very rigorously followed,

39
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:09,269
or I should say, a very moral society - so
very moral. But it was out of fear, the whole

40
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:24,949
morality came through fear, which is also
repeated in other religions. Now I would say

41
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:33,389
that Islam today, has taken that form, it
is the fear. They are not doing it out of

42
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:41,050
freedom. Also Christians, same thing, and
Hindus - I don't know - halfway this side,

43
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:54,249
and half way that side. Even among Sikhs there's
terrible disciplining. So much so that, as

44
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:08,209
punishment you have to clean the shoes of
all the people. I don't know if it is to beat

45
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:14,709
yourself with shoes or another. But quite
a lot of punishment is there.

46
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:21,709
Then came Shri Krishna and He saw the situation
- that the way people are really now fasting.

47
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:39,009
If you really go through the rituals of Hindu
religion, out of one week, you will be fasting

48
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:50,939
for six days at least. One day you might eat
some sort of a food, then you'll have to visit

49
00:14:53,869 --> 00:15:00,869
all kinds of places. Now, recently they had
to go, as you know, to Amarnath, and so many

50
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:11,670
died there. So now they said "we have got
Nirvana, we died while doing this, so we have

51
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:20,249
got Nirvana". This kind of a very funny idea
was existing. That we have Nirvana now, we

52
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:30,249
have achieved whatever we wanted and now we
are dead, so many are dead, so those who were

53
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:36,179
not dead were repenting why they were not
dead - it would have been much better, they

54
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:41,019
would have got their Nirvana.

55
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:48,019
So, even in this Kali Yuga these ideas are
prevalent. Even in India, people have very

56
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:04,279
severe types, especially in south I have seen,
they do all kinds of nonsense for the atonement

57
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:12,110
or maybe for something they are asking. All
this nonsense was too much for Shri Krishna.

58
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:23,829
He couldn't understand that they are going
to destroy their lives with this kind of ritualistic

59
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:31,279
gruelling, then what will remain out of them
for Sahaja Yoga. So He's the one who started

60
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:39,360
Sahaj culture. He said "let us enjoy, we must
have enjoyment, Nirmala Anand - pure joy".

61
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:56,259
How do we have pure joy by? - He had this
rakhi bandhan by which, apart from your wife,

62
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:08,779
everybody is your sister or mother. I must
say it is quite true about Indians. Not in

63
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:15,890
the north so much because of Islamic influence,
but in the south it is so. In Maharastra it

64
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:22,890
is so. And then He started also this Holi,
in which you should play with colors, maybe

65
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:35,500
to get rid of the color barriers we have,
maybe. In America it is a very good idea to

66
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:42,500
play with colors and put some black on the
whites and some whites on the black and they

67
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:52,040
can see for themselves how stupid it is to
fight in the name of color.

68
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:03,480
He used to play with children who were looking
after cows, just like a very ordinary person.

69
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:15,120
He never tried to show off His powers. He
never tried to stand out, never would dress

70
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:24,720
up in a very special way, never. Just like
an ordinary cowherd. And His relationship

71
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:37,040
with His mother, Yeshoda - she was not His
mother - was also extremely beautiful. There

72
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:47,330
are so many beautiful poems written about
His childhood. That, He's the one who is in

73
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:59,530
charge of the whole universe. As a little
boy used to put His finger into His mouth

74
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:06,530
wondering - how can a Divine Virata do that?
What is His thinking like a child? All His

75
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:23,830
actions of children. Yesterday's song, as
you heard it, is this. All these little, little

76
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:30,830
actions are described very well. Especially
by another very great poet, Surdas, who was

77
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:38,210
blind. His childhood is described in a very
beautiful manner and the description of His

78
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:47,500
relationship with His mother is very natural
and very sweet. It was not like this, as modern

79
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:55,260
times, a carpet is spoiled, "Oh, the carpet
you have spoiled it, I'll hit you hard, this

80
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:02,060
carpet you have spoiled". They have more interest
in their things than in their own children.

81
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:09,060
But according to our culture, if the child
breaks anything, you have to say this "very

82
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:19,410
good you have broken, some badha has gone
away". Never to scold a child for doing anything

83
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:27,550
which you think is destructive - because then
he will definitely become destructive. So

84
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,870
to understand a child, I think you must read
those poems, beautiful poems, which are written

85
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:42,870
about Shri Krishna. I don't know how their
imagination reached that beautiful height

86
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:49,900
of pure joy.

87
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:56,900
So towards our children also, we have to be
extremely sweet and nice and forgiving. But

88
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:08,710
some children, of course, I meet are difficult,
but they also can be corrected if you really

89
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:16,070
apply Shri Krishna's methods to him. Now when
He went to college, or we can say in to the

90
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:24,940
school of a Sandipanimuni, the guru. The guru's
wife was very kind. But the guru was strict.

91
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:42,370
And his wife used to look after him and when
she gave him something for food when they

92
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:52,700
would go and bring some woods from the forest.
It is very subtle, you know the whole thing

93
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:03,090
is. He went there and His friend was carrying
the food. His friend was carrying the food

94
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:15,330
and Shri Krishna was busy cutting the wood,
imagine? Shri Krishna was cutting the wood

95
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:22,330
for the mother. I mean, for the mother He
could do anything, He was God. So no work

96
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:35,200
for the mother was menial or lower. But the
other fellow, the friend of His, he was very

97
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:49,870
hungry, so he ate all the food and nothing
was left. So when he came down, he got very

98
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,600
much worried. He went and told his guru that
"I ate all the food and I didn't share it

99
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:12,400
with Shri Krishna". The guru got very angry,
very angry and he said "now, you will be cursed

100
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:21,940
with permanent poverty". But the mother said
"no, not permanent - till you meet Shri Krishna

101
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:34,270
again". That's how she tried to give, we call
it Upashad, in that you give another curse,

102
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:44,020
which can neutralize partly. The same friend,
was Sudama, and he was very very poor.

103
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:58,140
Now see the Sahaj ways of Shri Krishna, He
always used to remember Sudama and He told

104
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:08,060
His wife that I really I don't know, he's
cursed, I don't know what must be his condition,

105
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:15,830
where he must be? Now the friendship - He
was a king, such intimacy of feeling with

106
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:24,980
a friend. He said "I used to go with him,
I used to collect the woods. I mean, imagine

107
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:31,980
all these little, little things had such a
big importance for him. So, He was not only

108
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:38,650
worried about the whole world, as He should
have been, but also about Sudama - When will

109
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:45,650
I meet him? When will I see him again? Where
must be his house? How he must be living?

110
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:57,280
All these very delicate feelings He had for
His friend. Just like a Sahaja Yogi.

111
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:09,710
In the Sahaja style, we worry about the whole
world and also individually we are worried.

112
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:22,140
We come to know about one person who has fallen
sick, who has a problem, something is serious.

113
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:34,300
All the Sahaja Yogis think of him and are
worried about him, they may have everything,

114
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:46,330
but still they are worried, what is happening
to such and such person. How many of us know

115
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:55,490
each other's names - I mean He knows everybody's
name - practically. And how we care for them,

116
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:09,140
how we respect them, how we love them and
how we have pure relationships. Today is also

117
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:18,050
the day of Rakshabandhan, which is a very
great thing that we should have pure relationships.

118
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:27,340
I've seen in, say Maharashtra, men won't go
and talk to women much and women won't go

119
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:40,140
and talk to men. And once, somebody remarked
- "Then what are you women doing, talking

120
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:51,230
to women only?". So, I said what are we to
talk to you? You are talking about your office,

121
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:58,860
we are talking about our houses and homes.
What is there to talk to you? The western

122
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:06,160
culture is different, they will force you.
They'll make one man sit here and next to

123
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,900
him should be a woman, somebody else's wife,
then another man and then somebody else's

124
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:18,900
wife. How can you have intimacy? This kind
of idea, which is A-Sahaj, has slipped into

125
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:31,440
immorality. There's no need for men and women
to sit like that, what is the need, I just

126
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:42,960
don't understand. Compulsorily you have to
sit. I've had a bad time, I tell you, with

127
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:53,330
my husband's job, I never liked it. What is
there to talk to these men, after all, I don't

128
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:00,380
know anything about banking, I don't know
shares, I don't know stock exchange, what

129
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:07,380
it is. Or I don't know profits, and this and
that - that part is zero. Then, I don't know

130
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:15,680
about office, I don't know many other things
men talk about, so what is there to talk to

131
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,720
them - it is so very difficult. And whenever
I said something, I really dropped a brick.

132
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Once in a party, they were offering drinks
to everyone and this, so I said "I will have

133
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:46,770
a soft drink". So the valet came and gave
me a soft drink. The valet was having a bow,

134
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:54,050
and a white shirt, that's all, absolutely
A-Sahaj methods. Black bow, white shirt, black

135
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:02,800
coat, black pant, all just the same - whether
it is an ambassador or a valet. You can't

136
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:13,540
make it out who is who. So I drank, you know,
and when it was finished I gave it to an ambassador,

137
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:23,890
a very well known ambassador. To me there
was no difference at all, when they are just

138
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:42,350
say walking the same way, talking the same
way. So A-Sahaj the whole thing is. They say

139
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:54,810
they have so many Embassies, for what I don't
know and there what they have, always drinks,

140
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:05,040
parties - shake hands, shake hands. Your hands
will break, I tell you. Most A-Sahaj method

141
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:13,620
is to shake hands. Why not say Namaste, it
is better, and you know me. Sometimes I used

142
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:22,150
to get such heat. Like yesterday you have
shown that the ice melted. The same thing

143
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:30,770
used to happen to me. Mostly they were very
hot people and I didn't know what to do, I

144
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:37,770
used to stand on one side just feeling shy.
But this method of hand shaking is absolutely

145
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,640
A-Sahaj. And worse than that is French method,
is to kiss, and like it or not - you are kissed.

146
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:58,120
Or to hug somebody. The first time I gave
realization to one English gentleman, he just

147
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:05,530
lifted me up like that. I said " all right
- it's just out of joy he has done it, it's

148
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:24,350
all right". But there is no openness, there's
no openness of heart.

149
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:32,510
You go to a party, you have to be dressed
up like this only, if you are not dressed

150
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:39,510
up like that, then you are useless. If you
go for a death also. Somebody died, a great

151
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:48,280
friend, a nice man. So I was told I had to
wear a black sari. Black blouse, everything

152
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:57,240
black. I said, "I have no sari, black without
border, you know". So they said "you don't

153
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:08,160
go". I said "Very good idea". Because I don't
know these A-Sahaj methods. You are not supposed

154
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:16,860
to cry or weep there, no, you have to keep
quiet. Then when you go there, the body is

155
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:27,430
lying there, and after a prayer is said, you
are supposed to drink champagne. I mean, imagine

156
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:36,500
it, how can you, no feelings, for that body
which is lying there dead. And everybody very

157
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:47,850
happy, and if somebody looked unhappy, they
would ask "what's wrong, are you all right?".

158
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:54,850
No consciousness that we have lost a friend
here. This is the A-Sahaj style when it comes

159
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:04,080
to grief. When it comes to joy it is A-Sahaj,
when it comes to grief it is A-Sahaj. We have

160
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:21,690
to be Sahaj, in the sense that whatever we
do, we do it spontaneously. Not with deliberations.

161
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:33,970
We have some very anglicized people in India
also. And the lady of the house died 
and I went to see - and in India the body

162
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:51,610
is taken down on the ground. So they were
discussing what to do, what time to start

163
00:33:54,150 --> 00:34:01,150
the funeral and all that. So one lady, who
is a very well known person in India, she

164
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:06,760
said "you should not do it before twelve o'clock".
I said "why"? She said, "Because I'll have

165
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:13,760
to wear white". "That's true". "And I'll have
to go to the bank to get my diamonds to match

166
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:21,460
with the white sari". I said "What is this?"
Such filth of materialism. It is going too

167
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,000
far, we are going away from our feelings,
from our emotions, which are genuine, which

168
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:50,740
are there all the time, you don't have to
think about them, they exist all the time.

169
00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:01,840
But you think "Now, should I cry or not? Should
I laugh or not? It's so spontaneous. If you

170
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:14,810
have joy, you are spontaneous. You express
your joy spontaneously. Of course, not in

171
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:28,020
an uncultured way, but in a very cultured
way.

172
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:36,530
Now, what 's the meaning of the Sahaj culture
- this culture, is something that is, you

173
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:44,840
are groomed, you are brought up, in a very
natural manner, that you develop a culture.

174
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:56,240
A small, like, a child like, simple innocent
behavior. It is Shri Krishna's introduction

175
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:12,210
of idea of pure joy - Nirmala Anand, which
came as a great relief to Indian people because

176
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:33,720
they were following Shri Ramachandra. But
then abandonment started. The problem is,

177
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:45,350
if you make them strict, they become like
starched clothes I think, that you can't wear

178
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:01,020
them. Or if you allow them - no, no, you must
enjoy, you must enjoy, all right, you allow

179
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:08,690
them, do what you like. If you allow them
to do what you like, then they start doing

180
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:16,950
all kinds of things. In India, we had lots
of horrible things, which I dare not even

181
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:24,050
tell you - in the name of enjoyment. But Shri
Krishna Himself has been very much misrepresented

182
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:33,800
by stupid people like Vidyapati. He was a
great poet and he used Krishna and Radha as

183
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:43,840
Romeo and Juliet. That's the greatest insult
to the purity of their relationship. You must

184
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:54,060
have seen many pictures like that, in Kangra
Shaili, and this shaili, and that shaili.

185
00:37:54,140 --> 00:38:01,140
It's all nonsense. They could not show the
reality of their relationship, but some sort

186
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:16,360
of a very vulgar expression. Because I think
these poets and these artists at that time

187
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:28,619
had some hidden suppressed feelings within
themselves and they used Shri Krishna for

188
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:36,990
that. All kinds of romanticism is attached.
Sometimes I feel that people have not understood

189
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,530
Shri Krishna.

190
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:52,530
But there's a nice story about Him. That once,
His wives, He had many wives, that is also

191
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:07,260
another controversial point. He had many wives,
because these were sixteen thousand powers

192
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:18,230
of Shri Krishna, who had taken birth and were
captured by one king and kept in the prison.

193
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:30,310
So He had to release them, they were released.
Now how are they to live with Shri Krishna,

194
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:38,820
He was a young man - so He married all of
them. That is the case of Mohammed Sahib also.

195
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:50,550
He married all sixteen of them, they were
his powers. For a young man to keep sixteen

196
00:39:53,380 --> 00:40:00,380
thousand women like a harem, what people would
have thought of Him. So He married all of

197
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:10,930
them. And another point about His life is,
that once these all these ladies, and He had

198
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:20,790
also five wives. These five wives were the
causal of the five elements. So He had to

199
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,270
go.

200
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:38,270
Once, these ladies wanted to go to see one
great saint. And the river, which was there,

201
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:49,900
was all completely flooded. So, they came
to Shri Krishna and told Him that "How are

202
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:56,900
we to cross? - because this is over flooded.
He said "That's very easy to cross that river.

203
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:07,890
This river is called as the Virgin River,
Nirmada, now they are having big fights over

204
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:15,170
it in India nowadays, a big politics. So you
go and tell her that "Oh River, if Shri Krishna

205
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:32,580
is a complete celibate personality, perfect
brahmachari, if that is the truth, you go

206
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:43,330
down". And the river went down - and they
crossed over. Then they went and worshipped

207
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:53,200
the saint and when they came back to the bank
of the river it was again very much flooded.

208
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,890
So they went to that saint and asked him "Now,
how are we to go back?". He said "How did

209
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:05,890
you come?". They said "this is what Shri Krishna
asked us to tell the river". "Alright, you

210
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:14,109
go and tell the river that this saint has
not eaten any food whatsoever, nothing", while

211
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:23,550
they saw him eating plates after plates, if
this is the truth, then you better recede.

212
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:32,350
So, they went down and told the river, and
the river went down. They were amazed that

213
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:42,560
this man ate such a lot of things and this
river has gone down thinking this is the truth.

214
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:49,660
That means - what has been their character?.
They're abhogis. They're abhogis means, they

215
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:04,230
do not get, indulge into it, they eat, all
right, but they don't care, they don't have

216
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:17,530
that feeling of eating, and feeling of enjoying
the food, and nothing of the kind, they are

217
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:24,640
just eating. And this gentleman with seventeen,
I should say sixteen thousand and five wives,

218
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:35,650
is called as Brahmachari, because they are
not involved. They are in Sar state. With

219
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:49,350
such a great immaculate personality like Shri
Krishna, the way they have created this nonsense

220
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,850
of romanticism.

221
00:43:54,850 --> 00:44:01,850
For America, I think they have gone too far
with the freedom they have. As people with

222
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:17,680
Shri Krishna's blessings became free from
all the rules, regulations and got abandoned.

223
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:27,760
But America has gone much worse and not only
that, but the films they are producing are

224
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:37,080
very dangerous films and really damaging the
whole world. They don't know what sin they

225
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:48,070
are committing, for thousands and thousands
of people in the world have taken to all kinds

226
00:44:55,170 --> 00:45:02,170
of very destructive ugly ideas. Freud, all
right, he's ousted - finished, he's done already

227
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:13,480
a great harm. But what about these films,
they are now very much impressing our Indian

228
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:22,640
directors. I think all these directors are
guiding Indians to hell. The whole thing is

229
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:35,440
so absurd and so dirty. For an Indian mind
it is really inconceivable. Even, I have seen

230
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:44,930
Americans can't bear it, it has gone that
bad. Then other things have started with this

231
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:56,760
freedom that we have. Imagine if Shri Krishna
was here, He would never have put any oil

232
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:12,660
in His head, He would have never combed His
hair, as He must have His [indistinct]. And

233
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:19,970
He might have worn some mod dresses from America.
Otherwise, you cannot exist.

234
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:30,090
All the junk now has gone all over the world.
Selling in Moscow, selling in all the developing

235
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:44,580
countries. Only thing, when it was declared
that they have AIDS - people used to buy even

236
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:54,369
second hand from the tourists - they threw
away all that. They are carrying AIDS all

237
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:03,119
over and drugs all over. It's a destructive
force. It's a destructive force, which is

238
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:15,950
very active in this Kali Yuga and so we have
to have many Sahaja Yogis to fight this destructive

239
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:29,150
force. And when they are destructive they
are not hypocritical, that's they think is

240
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:41,230
a very great quality. But at least with hypocracy
you can save some people but when it's just

241
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,640
an open thing everybody starts doing that.

242
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:53,640
So when you think the time Shri Krishna lived
and the beautiful time they had, of such clean

243
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:02,320
life and how He killed all these demons, is
something so beautiful, so energy giving.

244
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:15,670
But how many demons there are nowadays in
this world - is it one? is it two?, is it

245
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,930
ten? One is finished, another comes up like
a mushroom that is finished, third one comes

246
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:30,930
up like a mushroom. And the most fertile land
is America.

247
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:43,770
So you all have to pay attention to this land
of Shri Krishna. Especially Shri Krishna should

248
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:51,760
really start using His Sudarshana Chakra,
would be a good idea. The time has come. That's

249
00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:03,130
why I gave you the conch. To declare the time
has come to clean this America. That is the

250
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:13,340
thing we have to do. Today when we worship
Shri Krishna, you must awaken within you yourself

251
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:22,240
that consciousness, that now Shri Krishna
is within all of you. And by your communication,

252
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:33,480
because He's collective, by your speech, by
your songs, by all that you use to communicate

253
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:16,040
with others, should carry the message of peace,
of love, of compassion, of 

254
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:09,810
truth 

255
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:35,190
and above all 

256
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:08,900
of Sahaja Yoga.
MAY GOD BLESS YOU !!!
