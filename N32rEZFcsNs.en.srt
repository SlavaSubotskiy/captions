1
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:44,030
So, this is how Mahamaya plays.
They had planned everything.

2
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:44,969
They had all the arrangements made
and the sari was missing.

3
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:50,979
All right. So they came and told Me that the
sari's missing,

4
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:55,549
so now what to do?
You can't have puja without the sari, according

5
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:00,170
to them.
So I said, "All right, let's wait.

6
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,979
If it arrives in time we'll have it;
otherwise we can have it later.

7
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:12,790
But I was least disturbed,
least upset.

8
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:19,030
Because I do not have a mental conception
of it.

9
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,620
But if you have a mental conception,
"Oh, we have programmed everything, arranged

10
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,760
everything.
We have done this and now it's fizzling out."

11
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Doesn't matter. Nothing is fizzling out.
But that is what we cannot do.

12
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:44,489
Because you asked Me today, "What is Mahamaya?"
This is what it is.

13
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:49,849
You must learn to accept whatever comes your
way.

14
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:56,659
That's one of the things.
And here where we feel frustrated, angry,

15
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:03,659
upset and spoil our joy, one of the things,
because we make a mental projection.

16
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:09,480
Mentally we calculate something.
This has to be.

17
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:16,480
And it's really in a way a subtle ego feeling.
Because I thought, "That's what is destined.

18
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,330
All right.
We'll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?"

19
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,239
In any case I told Mr. Srivastava that I'll
be back

20
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,150
only about two o'clock.
He said, "Why not in the morning?"

21
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:39,150
"I don't think it will be feasible."
So this is how you become avyagra.

22
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:49,099
Vyagra means person who is worried.
The one who is not worried.

23
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:56,659
So we worry because of two things.
Firstly, we worry that what will happen in

24
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,360
the future?
Future doesn't exist.

25
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,870
If you have made up your mind
that this should happen in the future,

26
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:16,870
then you get upset. That's one thing.
But you have not made any mental picture,

27
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:23,870
you will see what comes on the scene.
You'll watch whatever appears.

28
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,740
Then you're not worried, because you're anxious
to see

29
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:33,740
what's going to happen.
That's one way, that you feel hurt, that you're

30
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,120
worried.
Secondly you worry when you have built up

31
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,210
a myth,
picture of that "Oh, we're going to have a

32
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,380
puja now,
and we are not having it."

33
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:53,880
So you are upset.
What difference does it make?

34
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,280
And then you cannot enjoy My talk today and
the puja tomorrow.

35
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,160
Because today you think it was going to be
puja.

36
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,910
We are all dressed up well. Very nice
We spend so much time to get ready for the

37
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:13,400
puja.
All right, we'll have it tomorrow. What does

38
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,120
it matter?
We really decorated ourselves well.

39
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,020
We were all ready for the puja,
we were sitting here for the puja,

40
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:27,020
and now what has happened!
I didn't wear My sari for puja at all.

41
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:38,060
I knew what was coming.
So, it's all right to see you like this.

42
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,000
Because normally in the puja, I never see
you dressed like this,

43
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm busy with Myself.
Now I can see you nicely dressed. I feel very

44
00:05:55,009 --> 00:06:00,940
happy about it.
And these mental things are responsible for

45
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:07,090
frustrating us.
Like as I was telling you about money. Same

46
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,259
thing happens.
In India people come.

47
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,900
They keep so much money for buying things.
You see, sometimes they come loaded just like

48
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,100
what you call traders.
The customs are so kind, I mean

49
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,479
Sahaj Yogis have a free pass,
whether in India, or in England or anywhere.

50
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,430
And then they have a mental picture,
"We'll buy this." All right? "And see so much

51
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:35,030
we'll spend."
And if they have to spend some money for something

52
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,169
else,
they get upset because they have decided to

53
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:42,389
spend so much.
So then they might go to spend some money.

54
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:46,139
That's also, you see how Mahamaya works, you
see?

55
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:52,340
It has happened with all of you.
So they go and buy something.

56
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:59,340
I'll tell you Gavin bought once a image.
I don't know he paid about, I think 500 rupees

57
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:07,610
no how much have you paid about 4,000 or I
don't know.

58
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,150
How many pounds you paid for that?
Gavin: Forty pounds.

59
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,370
Forty pounds. He paid forty pounds for that
thing.

60
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:18,370
I would not even pay five pounds for that.
And I said, "What's this? How did you buy?"

61
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,490
"Oh, it's a very nice thing, Mother. We got
it in Agra."

62
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,310
I said, "It is from Nepal. If you buy it in
Agra,

63
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,979
I think it is very expensive and it's such
a waste."

64
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,319
But the worst was the vibrations were very
bad.

65
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,889
They thought they've bought something great.
And the vibrations were very bad and I noticed

66
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,060
it.
So he said, "All right, Mother. I'll keep

67
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,250
it in Your house
and You improve the vibrations." I tried.

68
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,060
It would not work out. I said, "Gavin, what
to do now?

69
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:52,060
You sink it in the Thames. I don't know what."
And then luckily it happened C.P. said that,

70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,960
"I have to take some present of Buddha to
Japan."

71
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,560
I said, "These Japanese exhibitors are good
for nothing.

72
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,629
No bhoot is going to trouble them."
So he said, "Can I buy something?"

73
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:09,500
I said, "Buddha's things means it's not easy
to get here."

74
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,490
"But I have avlokhiteshwara. Would you like
to take that?"

75
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,669
He said, "What is the price?"
I said, "Forty pounds."

76
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:20,389
He said, "All right. All right. I'll take
it.

77
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:26,979
And he bought it for forty pounds.
I said, "All right. Give it to the Japanese

78
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:30,470
fellow."
He was a very nasty person. I said, "Good

79
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,370
for him."
And I found it out that,

80
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,039
you see because I knew that it will have some
purpose somewhere.

81
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:48,039
So this is how our mental images are so rigid
that there's no flexibility in our understanding.

82
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:56,040
And if you start making it flexible then
and this is very early stages when Gavin had

83
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,560
gone to India,
very early. Now he's different.

84
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,510
So if you become flexible,
then what happens you see the joy of it.

85
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,280
You see how things get adjusted. But if it
is rigid,

86
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:16,589
then you get caught up into your own rigidity.
And you can never enjoy it,

87
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:21,420
because there's no movement for the Mahamaya
power.

88
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,640
And that's how then you feel frustrated.
You see it is all your own creation.

89
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,640
The mental projection is your creation,
and also the destruction is your creation.

90
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:44,350
Nobody is responsible for that. You are responsible.
But who does that is Mahamaya,

91
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:52,140
"Sankalpa vikalpa karo", you do decide something.
You say, "Now today I will go to Birmingham.

92
00:09:53,750 --> 00:10:00,750
I have to go to Birmingham.
I can't come for a meditation. I have to."

93
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,720
After some time you will find
that it's impossible to do something,

94
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,449
but to do what is needed for Sahaj Yoga.
Because whenever you will try to do something,

95
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:14,790
you will find it will frustrate you, it will
upset you.

96
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:21,790
If not, then it will make you realize
what is important, what you've missed.

97
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:31,390
Sometimes you get lost on the way.
You think that, "Oh God. We have lost the

98
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:38,299
way.
What to do? Now where to go?"

99
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:42,829
If I was you, I would say, "All right.
We've lost the way. Must be to find something

100
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:45,630
else."
And there I find something else which I've

101
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,360
been looking for,
for days together. I just see that there.

102
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,360
So if 
you trust your joy giving quality of your
Spirit,

103
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,339
that you're not going to lose that quality
of the Spirit,

104
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,709
at any cost.
Then that acts as a guide

105
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:22,709
and you understand the flexibility
of all these worldly, transitory things.

106
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,160
They are all changeable,
only you cannot change because you are the

107
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:42,140
Spirit.
Today I wanted to talk about Mooladhara,

108
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:49,140
which is very important subject.
I think I have talked about it many a times.

109
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,920
But in the West I must say,
because of our wrong attitudes

110
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:11,870
and the acceptance of wrong mental projections
of other people who are very dominating,

111
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:25,670
we have very much ruined our Mooladhara.
Despite the fact that Kundalini has risen

112
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,559
with whatever weaker power that Mooladhara
had,

113
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:42,559
and has sustained itself,
we must know that we can always fall a trap

114
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:52,929
to our different bifurcations which we had
created before.

115
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:04,280
It's a very serious matter
that the Mooladhara chakra has been really

116
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:10,910
shattered,
and we have created pathways

117
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:17,910
into which our attention can go
if we are not very careful.

118
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:26,329
Now supposing if somebody is a dishonest person,
or a miserly person, or money oriented,

119
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:33,329
it is very gross and you can see it so clearly.
You see yourself and you get shocked how,

120
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,500
"Why did I say such a thing? Why did I do
such a thing?"

121
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:48,500
But when it comes to the left side nonsense,
sin against the Mother,

122
00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:01,079
it's a secretive action
that's only between you and yourself.

123
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,120
Nobody knows what goes on in your mind, except
for you.

124
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Nobody knows what you are going to do
next moment in your privacy when you are alone.

125
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:32,819
Nobody can look into you except for your Mother.
I also only feel your Mooladharas.

126
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:40,299
To be very frank with you,
that's one center I find it difficult to feel

127
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:47,510
Myself.
The reason is, I have a very, very strong

128
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:54,660
Mooladhara,
which is not so sensitive, I would say.

129
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:01,569
It is not bothered.
The attention of My Mooladhara doesn't go

130
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:07,780
near any other Mooladhara. It just recedes
back,

131
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:13,470
that's the action it plays all the time.
So I also, unless and until it is very badly

132
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,390
off,
I mean the person is very close to Me,

133
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,559
then I feel the Mooladhara very strongly.
But still I can?

134
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:26,189
Supposing you give Me something, that thing
is used by you,

135
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:33,189
immediately I can feel it.
So the correction of Mooladhara entirely depends

136
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,809
on you.
And without a strong Mooladhara you cannot

137
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:43,069
rise high,
do what you like.

138
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:50,069
Now for people who are Indian,
who have respected their Mooladharas,

139
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:58,819
there are so many methods and ways given
how to raise the power of Mooladhara.

140
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:09,030
But that won't work out with the Western people,
because it's a damaged one.

141
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:16,410
It's one which is a shattered one,
and which does not work on the physical side

142
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:21,640
of the Mooladhara,
but on the emotional side as we call the "Mana",

143
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:28,640
the left side.
So, even you may not talk in that way,

144
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:39,390
but your mind is still in that realm.
And you still think on that realm.

145
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:49,809
Even mentally, you are in it.
Or you are seeing things,

146
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,240
wanting to see such things,
wanting to enjoy such things.

147
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:06,240
That lurking attraction is still there,
your Mooladhara cannot strengthen.

148
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:13,990
And we have to realize that I'm talking to
Western people.

149
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:20,020
I would not say the same to the people from
India.

150
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:27,020
So now we have to work out much harder.
To be on the watch-out, to deal with yourself.

151
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:37,940
And it is more a mental activity.
"Mental" meaning I mean the emotional side.

152
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:48,190
You have to watch your mind.
In English, it's a very funny word "mind"

153
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:53,960
is. But "Mana",
through which we cater to our emotional side,

154
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,850
to our desires.
Where is it going?

155
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:05,850
Where is this movement of our mind?
What is it doing?

156
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,940
You have to stand against your mind,
stand against your desires,

157
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:20,600
or you can face it
and see for yourself clearly what's happening.

158
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:27,600
It's for you to decide.
Nobody is going to correct you on this point.

159
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,600
I know you people have been confessing to
Me.

160
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,100
I never read your letters, to be very frank.
Whatever letters you sent, I would not read

161
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,860
it.
Whatever confessions you have made,

162
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:46,150
I burnt all those letters.
I haven't got any idea as to what you did.

163
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:53,000
Nor do I want to know about it.
That's not My concern.

164
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
My concern is that now
you do not dwell upon the same ideas,

165
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:12,950
on the same level,
or on any level whatsoever, we can say.

166
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:22,360
It is in thoughtless awareness you can combat
the thoughts that come to you

167
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,780
from wrong type of Mooladhara.
Maybe some of you have got bhoots on your

168
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:33,920
Mooladhara.
And we have some physical treatment for such

169
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:40,920
bhoots also,
which I'll tell to Gavin sometime,

170
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:45,670
which you can ask.
But you cannot always say that,

171
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,480
"It is a bhoot and I'm all right. I'm away
from the bhoot."

172
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,230
You are not. Whenever you say, "I have a bhoot,"
means you yourself you're siding with the

173
00:19:53,230 --> 00:20:00,230
bhoot.
You see a person as a Sakshi.

174
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:13,900
That means you see that person
but you do not get a reaction,

175
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:24,180
which is killer of joy.
You yourself can feel your Mooladharas very

176
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:39,210
well.
You can feel it on your fingertips also.

177
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:45,580
And be alert about it.
If you want to be kind to yourself,

178
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:52,580
know that you have to divert your attention
towards a sane married life.

179
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:01,890
But also that should not be too much.
Because what I have learnt now,

180
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:08,560
that in the West people have devised methods
of transferring their attention

181
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:15,330
from one person to another.
Mental acrobatics of different type

182
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:22,330
they have devised to destroy their pure attention.
Don't play onto these.

183
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:36,160
There are so many other things by which
we express that we are still under the trap

184
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,540
of a bad Mooladhara.
The way you dress up, the way you walk,

185
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:50,540
the way you sit, the way you talk,
the way you behave, to impress other people.

186
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:04,770
I am to be impressed by other people in Sahaja
Yoga itself.

187
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:11,770
The only impression that should really work
is the height of ascent that others have achieved.

188
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,640
You can do it; it's not difficult.
When the Kundalini can rise with all such

189
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,370
shattered
Mooladharas, I'm sure you can cure your Mooladhara

190
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,920
completely.
But your question is first of all

191
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:36,440
of strengthening the Mooladhara,
for which I think you all have to go into

192
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:43,440
a kind of tapasya.
That's why I say sometimes

193
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,440
that the Western people should take to less
of meat,

194
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:54,440
especially the red meats and beefs,
and horses, and dogs

195
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:03,130
and I don't know what else you eat.
Take more to vegetarian food.

196
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,250
I'm not saying vegetarianism, you understand
that.

197
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:20,130
Take more to things
which do not give you so much heat in the

198
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:25,980
body.
Even fish is very [inaudible].

199
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,980
So take to a life which is in a way ascetic,
but don't take to these horrible health foods

200
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,180
also.
I can't tolerate them I tell you.

201
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,770
They're not meant for human beings, but for
animals I think.

202
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:45,950
They churn your stomach completely, and it's
horrible.

203
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:50,850
This Country Store thing I took once and I
said "had enough of it!"

204
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:57,850
Country Store - the whole country went into
My stomach.

205
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,010
So for you people,
(You have to go?)

206
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:11,010
Those who are suffering from Mooladhara must
know

207
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,480
that food does make a difference
in the powers of Mooladhara.

208
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:29,490
So if you have to get it cured, first of all
you have to soothe it down, it is over-excited,

209
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:35,380
over-excited.
Any man you touch, any woman you touch,

210
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,260
any woman you look at ...
I just don't understand, it's worse than monkeys.

211
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:46,450
Horrible.
You have to soothe it down, cool it down,

212
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:51,450
so that Ganesha bestows His blessings upon
your Mooladhara.

213
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:57,500
There's no grace.
But it's not so outside that I can say that,

214
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:04,500
"you must respect yourself."
It cannot work out with those words I know.

215
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:15,980
You have to sit down,
do meditation and try to soothe it down.

216
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:23,970
I'll discuss with Gavin and I'll tell him
what things can be done about it,

217
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:30,220
because I can't tell you in the open like
this.

218
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:37,010
But still this is all physical.
Mentally you must be on the watch

219
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:42,620
to see where does this mind go - to dirty
things.

220
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:49,620
Why does it always go to this sensation?
See the birds, see the flowers, see the nature,

221
00:25:53,540 --> 00:26:00,540
see the beautiful people, just see them.
Another horrible thing in the West

222
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,960
is that the women must expose their body
to get men excited.

223
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,550
Men do the same I think.
They always try to excite each other

224
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:19,550
and live in a stupid excitement.
You have to expose beautiful things, like

225
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,380
flowers,
beautiful ornaments.

226
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:33,380
All right? But you're not a thing!
It's your private property.

227
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:46,780
You don't put all your gold on the streets,
do you?

228
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:54,230
Better try that, sometimes.
You will mind people plundering your gold,

229
00:26:54,230 --> 00:27:01,230
but you don't mind your chastity being plundered.
Everyone looking at you with dirty eyes.

230
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:07,240
You don't feel insulted?
Because ego is a dirty stuff. It does not

231
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,510
mind.
It feels happy that people are watching you.

232
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:18,510
They are plundering you.
They are looting your chastity.

233
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:26,920
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.
But still I must say you must cleanse your

234
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:38,950
hearts,
cleanse your minds, take yourself out of it.

235
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:50,150
The minds are very funnily placed,
and that's why the greatest complications

236
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:54,500
there are
in the brains of people.

237
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:01,500
They are very confused,
very confused people.

238
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,750
Because there is no wisdom in this kind of
life.

239
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:11,750
You become just a sex-oriented personality.
It is actually just the other way round.

240
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,450
If you are money-oriented, you want to preserve
money.

241
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,179
If you are possession-oriented you want to
preserve it.

242
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:23,700
If you get one little antique piece you want
to preserve it.

243
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,860
And why not this property of yours
which is the highest of all,

244
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:35,860
to be preserved, to be adorned,
to be worshipped?

245
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:45,710
I'm quite worried on that point
that secretly people are indulging into such

246
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,750
things.
And they're hypocritical sometimes,

247
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:55,030
they don't mind being hypocritical about it.
They are Sahaja Yogis, all right,

248
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,200
but in this matter they think they can go
about

249
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,720
the way they like. And sometimes some of them
say that

250
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,650
"Mother has said it's all right." I never
said so!

251
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:11,650
There's one point I cannot compromise is this.
You must have a chaste outlook towards yourself,

252
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,470
towards your life, towards your being,
towards your personality. You are saints.

253
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:22,470
And if a saint doesn't have a good character,
I call it the character, the essence of character,

254
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:32,809
is not a saint.
So this purity has to be maintained.

255
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:42,429
There cannot be any compromise on that.
You cannot hit at the roots of everything.

256
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:50,679
If it works out,
in a collective way, nobody cheats oneself,

257
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,960
nobody deceives oneself
and put the mind into right track of ascent.

258
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,770
Thinking about the ascent, how you are going
to rise,

259
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:07,940
thinking of the moments when you had the joys,
thinking of the day where you met Me first,

260
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,840
thinking of all the other beautiful and holy
things,

261
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:18,840
your mind can be cleansed.
And whenever such a thought comes in, you

262
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:24,700
have to say,
"not this, not this, not this."

263
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:31,700
It's more mental than physical, I tell you.
I know it's difficult,

264
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:38,610
but if you can get realization why not this
also?

265
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:43,080
You all have to understand
that there is no compromise on this.

266
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,020
And a day may come, if you continue with it,
you will be thrown away completely,

267
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:55,020
just like any other devil is thrown out.
So there is no compromise. Tell yourself,

268
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:02,600
don't deceive yourself, don't cheat yourself.
You cannot ascend

269
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:08,730
if there is any lurking thing within you.
You will be dragged down, because that's your

270
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,670
weakness,
and you will become weaker, and weaker and

271
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:19,010
weaker.
Only question is "where is your attention?"

272
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:26,010
Divert. Divert your attention.
First you will need some exercise, some effort,

273
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:37,620
and afterwards it will come automatically.
You won't have to exert, you won't have to

274
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,990
worry.
On the contrary,

275
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:49,990
it will become impossible how to be otherwise.
So much conditioning is there.

276
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,760
We have played into the hands of conditioning,
we have ruined ourselves.

277
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:03,880
This conditioning is the subtlest of all,
and the worst of all.

278
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,400
It's impossible to combat in Sahaja Yoga,
unless and until you individually

279
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,890
take up the responsibility of looking after
it.

280
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:21,890
Mooladhara is one of the most delicate,
and the most powerful chakra.

281
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,000
It has so many folds and it has so many dimensions.
If your Mooladhara is not all right, your

282
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:47,309
memory will fail.
If your Mooladhara is not all right, to begin

283
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:52,940
with,
your wisdom will fail.

284
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:59,780
You will have no sense of direction.
The insanity that is now crawling up in America

285
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,559
before they become forty years of age
is because their Mooladharas are out.

286
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:11,559
Most of the diseases which are incurable
come because of weak Mooladharas,

287
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,910
on the physical side.
On the mental side,

288
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:24,910
most of the mental problems we saw there,
most, I would say ninety percent,

289
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:31,049
are due to weak Mooladhara.
If a person has a strong Mooladhara,

290
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:37,720
powerful Mooladhara,
it doesn't get into trouble.

291
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:44,640
Because you know there's a very strong hold
of the Mooladhara in the back there.

292
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:51,640
And when your mind goes off,
you blame the brain.

293
00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:01,280
It's not the brain, mostly it is the Mooladhara.
So for physical safety and for your emotional

294
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:10,559
safety also,
you have to have a sane type of attitude towards

295
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,549
Mooladhara.
That's why I'm very anxious that you all should

296
00:34:16,549 --> 00:34:20,260
get married,
and after marriage, after a few days, you

297
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,710
find
that your attention starts diverting to other

298
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:30,710
problems of married life.
But not if you are not a Sahaja Yogi,

299
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:41,159
because the sensationalization
has become the main theme of modern life.

300
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:48,159
And you are tossed about on the rough sea
of all these deliberate actions of the people.

301
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:59,980
Media, books, ideas, everything,
creates this horrible excitable temperament

302
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:11,900
within you.
Such a person doesn't have any patience,

303
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:18,570
doesn't have any balance.
Actually he's hypocritical,

304
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:25,570
and has a very bad left Vishuddhi.
So many complications take place with this.

305
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:33,980
Before realization, forget the past.
Whatever you have done, forget it.

306
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,440
Just don't worry.
But remember one thing,

307
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,920
that you have damaged your Mooladhara.
So you have to look after it, you have to

308
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,020
soothe it down,
you have to bring it to normalcy.

309
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:57,020
You have to make it a healthy,
balanced center,

310
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:05,730
so that Shri Ganesha can rule over it.
Talking about Shri Ganesha,

311
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:16,260
you know vibrations become too much for Me.
We talk of innocence,

312
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:26,730
but to awaken innocence within ourselves
we must be on the full watch,

313
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:33,990
on the full alertness about our minds.
What is it thinking? Where is it going?

314
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:38,960
Where is this thief going?
Is he trying to do some tricks?

315
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:45,960
Is he up to some tricks? All right!
You have to be alert, very alert.

316
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,250
I've been thinking of talking about it since
long.

317
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:56,250
But now I have to tell you one thing.
That you'll be exposed.

318
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,550
That is another quality of Mahamaya.
She'll expose you.

319
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:06,850
You'll be exposed
if you try to play tricks with Me.

320
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:12,920
"With Me" means with your Kundalini.
If you try to play tricks with your Kundalini,

321
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,190
you'll be exposed.
And you'll be ashamed of yourself.

322
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:25,190
So please be careful, very careful about it,
that you again make your Mooladhara very healthy,

323
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:38,100
and powerful.
May God bless you!

324
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:47,750
So our prayer should be that
"Let our Mooladhara be healthy and strong."

325
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:59,550
That's all. Let's pray.
There are certain exercises for Mooladhara.

326
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:15,609
I will explain to Gavin who is your leader
in England.

327
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:19,420
Then he will pass it on to you.
It should be done verbally. It should not

328
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:25,600
be written down.
The leaders of the ashrams and other places

329
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:32,600
should come and see him every month sometime,
and these things should be talked.

330
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:41,880
Because it's a secret,
not to be discussed openly.

331
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:48,880
It's a secret, between you and yourself.
It should not be written down anywhere.

332
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:55,200
It should not be mentioned,
but should be worked out by all of you,

333
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:02,200
in such a way that you enjoy the bliss of
Shri Ganesha.

334
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:07,510
Is more for the ladies, I would say, than
for the men.

335
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:14,510
Because men suffer much more than women do.
And that's why women must be very careful.

336
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:25,080
Develop very good relationships with your
brothers.

337
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:33,130
Unless and until you really establish your
high character,

338
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:41,450
men cannot be improved.
You have seen in India women don't like it

339
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:44,000
if anyone tries to look at them, or tries
to touch them.

340
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,170
They don't like it.
Women have killed themselves, burnt themselves

341
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:54,010
up,
thousands of them, because they thought some

342
00:39:54,010 --> 00:40:01,010
other people may come and touch their body.
It's so related to your Atma, to your Spirit.

343
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:14,380
As if it is the body,
innocence is the body of your Spirit.

344
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:21,690
You all can be that, because you have become
yoginis now.

345
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:28,690
They were not yoginis, but they knew one thing
the power of their chastity.

346
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:36,920
It's more for ladies here,
that they should try to generate that feeling

347
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:44,810
of nobility, of chastity,
of holiness around them,

348
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:51,810
so that the men themselves respect them
and develop that feeling within themselves.

349
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:54,580
Thank you 

350
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:14,280
very much.
