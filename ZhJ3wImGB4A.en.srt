00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:12,340
Today we are celebrating birth of Christ, which was
a very big event in the realm of human awareness.

2
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:23,220
As you know that he is born in the Agnya chakra
and he sucked the ego and superego that is

3
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:35,449
the condition within us and our ego. Such
a great happening has taken place, about 2000

4
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:46,510
years back. But today is the time for us to
use utilize that great advent on this earth.

5
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:56,100
To understand Christ first of all we have
to know that he was just nothing but Omkara.

6
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:08,759
He was just made of vibrations and that is
why he was resurrected. And he was detached

7
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:22,520
because of his very nature and so we too have
to understand that we have to be detached

8
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:32,900
first from our thoughts and that as you know
is achieved if you know how to forgive others.

9
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:40,570
There is this very subtle attachments people
have that those who are born in the Christian

10
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:48,100
religion think that Christ is their own and
that he resides in their pocket. On the contrary

11
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,860
it is just the other way round. That he has
nothing to do with them and he is against

12
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,810
them. As Christ has said you will be calling
me Christ Christ and I will not know you.

13
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:05,699
So it is important that Christians should
never think that Christ is our own and that

14
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:10,079
he is our because all your life you have lived
like Christians. Actually you have not; you

15
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:15,290
have not lived like Christians. So those who
have not lived like Christians only have taken

16
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:22,040
the name of Christianity are not in the real
sense the people who follow Christ. So now

17
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:29,089
we have to change ourselves and follow him
in our life. Unless and until we imbibe him

18
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:41,709
in our lives we have not understood the greatness
of his advent. Just because we are Christians

19
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:48,260
or so called Christians to believe, we have
much to do about him and to be identified

20
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:56,110
with him is absolutely wrong and that is what
I want you before that we have to imbibe all

21
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:04,860
his qualities. It was a living example of
a very great advent that he came on this earth

22
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:12,319
and led such a pure and holy life. Try to
develop your purity and holiness and a powerful

23
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:20,270
holiness and a powerful auspiciousness which
does not get contaminated, but fights whatever

24
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:30,959
is anti god whatever is antichrist. So today
is the day when we are celebrating his birthday

25
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:37,900
again and on this day let him be born within
us let him be born in our character, in our

26
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,949
behavior, in our temperament. He was a detached
man, not attached to material things, nothing

27
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:51,300
of the kind; he lived like a carpenter’s
son, in a very uncomfortable life, absolutely.

28
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:58,270
And he never bothered about small things of
life. Actually you know a carpenters house

29
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:03,600
is one of the most dangerous place to live
in because you have all kinds of nails, you

30
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:11,000
have all kinds of funny types of instruments
that you use. Any day you can step along on

31
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,520
to anything and can get hurt and there is
hardly any place where you can sleep, the

32
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,920
whole place is filled with wood and the people
mostly sleep on wood, but just the other way

33
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,400
round. The so called Christians are so particular
about our comfort and it is very easy for

34
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,720
us to condemn others it is very easy, it is
something so absurd, I mean it is so absurd,

35
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,120
you see anything they will go say to a market
place oh it is horrid they will go some place

36
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:48,920
they will say that’s bad. What about you?
What is within yourself? Just see within yourself.

37
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,040
And this is the thing we have to develop now.
We have to cleanse our self from within. You

38
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:00,050
have to be uncomfortable with yourself not
in with out. You have to be uncomfortable

39
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:05,579
with what bad things we have within ourselves
and not from without. Take your attention

40
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:12,300
from outside inward as Christ lived a life
which was inward. He was not living outside.

41
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:18,870
He was living inside himself and that is what
we have to today understand, on this day that

42
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,679
our new birth should take us inward. Our worry
should be for our inward comfort and not for

43
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:29,230
outward comfort. Like yesterday, if you didn’t
like the picture, it is a good sign that you

44
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,740
can’t live with dirt and filth. But that
is still outside. But what about the inward

45
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:41,100
dirt and filth, what about the inward thoughts
that are contaminating us what about the silly

46
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:49,370
ideas that are still in our head, take them
away, throw them away and be again born like

47
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:57,089
a lotus like Christ, who all his life lived
like this died for us and was resurrected.

48
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:02,799
So we have such a great example to be imbibed
within ourselves in our character in our lives.

49
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:08,720
This is I am saying again and again because
we really get confused. We think if we have

50
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:19,049
a sort of a passport, we are alright, no that
is not simple. It is the becoming within yourself

51
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:29,240
of Christ like behavior. And the greatest
of all is forgiving, the forgiveness which

52
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,640
is so lacking in us. You see, unless and until
we develop that this ego has to go away. If

53
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:42,400
you have to be Christians, you have to be
egoless and that is what one has to understand

54
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:51,189
that when we talk of Christ birth such a beautiful
time, though he was born in complete discomfort.

55
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:56,110
He could have born in a king’s place, he
could have born anywhere but why he did it?

56
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:02,400
Because he knew that when Christians will
come they will select the best beds for themselves,

57
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,410
the best houses for themselves, and little
bit here and there they won’t tolerate.

58
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,870
They will be shouting for little things, like
the carpet is spoiled this is spoiled that

59
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:23,000
is spoiled. It is so low minded. So for you
it is important that you must rise higher.

60
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,640
Higher and see how he was born in a manger,
in such a uncomfortable place where there

61
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:36,010
were all kinds of cows and cow dung and everything
was spread there and he just didn’t bother.

62
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:45,589
He just got his birth in a place which you
would not like to even visit or to sit there.

63
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:49,089
And the mother cleaned the whole thing for
him and he was born there a sparkling star

64
00:14:49,089 --> 00:15:07,350
of the heavens, to cleanse. Because if you
are clean, you clean others. So this today,

65
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:14,530
the great day of his advent let us celebrate
in this great country of yoga specially this

66
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:27,579
bhumi of Puna which is the punyabhumi that
auspiciousness, the holiness, and the complete

67
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:35,439
detached temperament of Christ you are going
to imbibe within ourselves and we are going

68
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:46,819
to live like real followers of Christ and
his life. Today we are Sahaja yogis so you

69
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:52,429
have no cars, no customs, you have no religion
now. Now you have only one universal religion

70
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:54,429
that is Sahaja Yoga.

71
00:15:54,429 --> 00:16:01,240
Christ is worshipped everybody worships Christ
because he came not for one person, 2 person

72
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:11,120
or 10 persons but those who worship him must
express his character, his life, the materialist

73
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,220
how can they talk of Christ I just can’t
understand because there was no material thing

74
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:22,020
in his body. He had no matter in him. He was
just vibration. That is how he walked on the

75
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:30,230
water, so how can materialist ever claim anything
about Christ I can’t understand. This is

76
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:40,870
the problem one faces when one sees how we
juxtaposition of what we proclaim. Now this

77
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:51,620
is the part which we have to achieve and once
you achieve it, you will be amazed that god

78
00:16:51,620 --> 00:17:01,439
looks after you. How a flower flourishes in
the wilderness, how it gets its water, how

79
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:13,870
it is looked after how it is so beautiful.
It is not bothered in the same way when you

80
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:21,860
become that beautiful being which is the spirit
you are looked after. You get all the blessings,

81
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,510
all the joy because the source of joy is that
absolutely. But when you cover it with your

82
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:36,620
ego that joy will get away, so just try to
clean that ego somehow see your ego how much

83
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,690
ego still you are there, you get out. Take
it out with affection, with kindness towards

84
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:51,049
yourself and towards others, try to rise,
rise higher and higher into that realm which

85
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:59,840
Christ has created for us in the limbic area
where it is the kingdom of god.

86
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,720
May god bless you all that you follow his
life and you imbibe all his quality within

87
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:14,480
yourself and also your mother and I am here
to teach all these things and to tell you

88
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,620
how to do it. And you have to see to it. How
I am detached in the same way try to be detached.

89
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:27,210
You try to please Me by giving me this and
that but you know I am a very detached person,

90
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:32,120
I don’t understand it attachment I don’t
understand attachment and I just sometimes

91
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,960
smile at people when they try to say Mother
we would like to give you this and that alright

92
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:44,230
give but I am not attached. I cannot get attached
there is nothing within Me that gets stick

93
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:50,570
on to anything, nothing, I am just a moving
force of kundalini, how can I stick on anyone.

94
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:55,280
I am just moving all the time so it is not
possible for Me to get attached to anything.

95
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:02,870
In the same way, you just get inside this
force and move with Me and just forget about

96
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:09,130
all the rest of the things which stop your
progress. You must progress with dignity,

97
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:17,230
you must rise. I am sure it is going to happen.
This time the people have been very sensible,

98
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:24,710
they have been least critical, though some
are still like that like that but most of

99
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:32,419
them have been very sweet and very dignified
and the collective is good and I am very happy

100
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:38,030
that the people are being so well in this
program. I am very happy May God Bless you.
