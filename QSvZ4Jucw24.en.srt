1
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:19,850
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

2
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:33,980
I am very happy that this book is now published 
and a subtler side, a deeper dimension of

3
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:40,809
‘Gita’ is being brought, to the readers.

4
00:00:40,809 --> 00:01:02,010
As Krishna was a great diplomat and understood 
that human beings are very clever and they

5
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,230
cannot accept truth in a straightforward manner.

6
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:19,590
He, in His advice to Arjuna used His diplomacy 
and the essence of His diplomacy is always

7
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:31,939
specially of the defined, Divine Diplomacy 
which He used that give absurd conditions

8
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:41,040
and solutions to such difficult people who 
are so proud of their limited intellect.

9
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,850
That’s a difference between a father and 
a mother I should say.

10
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,240
As we say in Hindi ‘Sidhe Haath ghee na 
nikle tho tedhii ungli karni pardti hai’

11
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,420
[Meaning: when we can’t take out ghee with 
straight finger, we have to bend our finger.

12
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,670
Famous proverb implying that when we can’t 
get a work done in a straight way, we need

13
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,920
to bend our ways.].

14
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:13,790
The first and foremost thing we have to understand 
that Shri Krishna is a Divine incarnation

15
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:25,980
and He came at a time where we needed to understand 
what is the essence of dharma.

16
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:39,140
For example I have been quite surprised the 
way people explain Him as far as the hinsa

17
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,860
is concerned.

18
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,890
That Shri Krishna preached ahinsa to such 
an extent that we have to look after all the

19
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,640
mosquitoes of Delhi.

20
00:02:48,640 --> 00:03:08,290
Such absurd things people have deducted by 
what Krishna tried to emphasize in Shri Gita.

21
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:22,910
When the war started, Arjuna actually became 
nervous I can say and He said, “I would

22
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:29,030
not like to fight My own kith and kin and 
My Gurus.

23
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,030
”

24
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:38,200
So Shri Krishna says, “They are already 
dead, they are killed.

25
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,140
Because they were not enlightened people, 
are already dead people their eyes are not

26
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,140
open.

27
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,170
Whom are You going to kill here?

28
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:55,440
Just You have to remove some people from this 
Earth to establish Dharma.

29
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
”

30
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,481
Now the idea of Dharma according to us is 
some sort of a Hinduism or Islamism or some

31
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:06,380
sort of a ism; it is not.

32
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:14,140
Dharma is the valency in a human being just 
like carbon has four valencies; dharma has

33
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,570
ten valencies in a human being.

34
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:23,250
And when a person falls down from there then 
he loses his powers as a human being.

35
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:32,370
One of the examples He said at the time of 
war – Karna the great generous man very

36
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:45,210
well known for His great virtues was caught 
up by a wheel of His chariot and He could

37
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,250
not take out His leg out of that chariot.

38
00:04:49,250 --> 00:05:07,320
When Arjuna faced Him and raised His own Gandiva 
and Karna challenged Him saying that, “I

39
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:21,759
am a Vira” – a chivalrous person, a person 
who is fighting, “and You are another warrior

40
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:33,300
and in Dharma when I have no weapons on Me, 
You cannot kill Me with Your weapon.

41
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,300
”

42
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,720
That time Shri Krishna pointed at Him like 
this and He said, “Kill Him.

43
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:47,730
Where was His warrior virtues when Draupadi 
was insulted?

44
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:55,879
Draupadi’s insult was the greatest sin that 
was committed and what was He doing at that

45
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,249
time?”

46
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:04,039
And Arjuna killed Karna.

47
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,729
This is Dharma.

48
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:23,740
He’s called as the Leeladhara – the one 
for Him the whole world is a play.

49
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:29,610
And that’s why He says that already they 
are killed.

50
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,860
That doesn’t mean that you start killing 
people, becoming violent because you do not

51
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,360
agree with some people.

52
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,659
Shri Krishna can say whom to kill.

53
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:53,039
You have to be a realized soul to understand 
why Shri Krishna had to ask Him to kill and

54
00:06:53,039 --> 00:07:01,159
why the Goddess had to kill so many demons.

55
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:13,620
But the idea today is – we should try to 
be sympathetic towards also demons and the

56
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:20,789
devils who are spreading ‘asuri vidya’ 
everywhere.

57
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:25,809
And we should be sympathetic with all the 
people and there is good in everyone.

58
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:29,099
That is not Krishna’s message.

59
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:38,860
He showed His love by killing the demons.

60
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:47,349
I don’t know in this book if I have talked 
on this point or not because he had very limited

61
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:53,380
subjects, which he dealt with, and I didn’t 
want to pressurize him with some new subject

62
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,380
matters.

63
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:00,180
But there’s one thing definitely, which 
I didn’t say there which is a very important

64
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,509
point one should try to see.

65
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:19,259
That the awareness – ‘Chetana’, the 
awareness, grows downward of a human being

66
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:27,830
and the roots of the tree of the awareness 
are in the brain.

67
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:37,150
So one has to take to ‘urdvagati’ – means 
the ascent and not to the descent.

68
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:47,140
A human being is born in the Bhavasagara, 
which is as we call in the void, as you can

69
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,690
see here clearly in Sahaja Yoga.

70
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,880
Either he can go upward or he can go downward.

71
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:05,600
Now see the, how the human awareness has reached 
‘adhogati’ – is a downward descent.

72
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:13,010
Very simple to see if you understand what 
Krishna meant that the roots are in the brain?

73
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:21,510
When I’ve been in the Western countries 
I realize it’s much more because they are

74
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:28,660
supposed to be advanced, developed, sophisticated, 
educated, intellectuals, whatever you may

75
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,320
call them.

76
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,870
I’ve been to all Communists countries and 
all the democracies and all kinds of isms.

77
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:47,710
What I realized that exactly what Shri Krishna 
had said that asuri vidya will take over.

78
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:52,350
The descent of awareness is seen clearly in 
those countries.

79
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,230
Thank God we are not that advanced.

80
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:06,841
The descent starts from the Nabhi Chakra as 
we call it where a person starts seeking the

81
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:15,780
food this that and other requirements, then 
it starts moving downwards.

82
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,290
The essence of the Nabhi Chakra is ‘Swaha’.

83
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,470
‘Swaha’ is the consumption.

84
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,460
It consumes everything, it aggresses everything, 
consumes, just like the fire.

85
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,790
In the same way once upon a time these developed 
countries spread all over the world started

86
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:39,200
consuming everyone.

87
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,240
Ruling our country, China, all kinds of countries, 
they went round all over the world.

88
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,200
Thank God Columbus missed his point otherwise 
we would not have been here.

89
00:10:51,200 --> 00:11:00,640
He went to America and you cannot find aboriginals 
unless and until you enter into some far fetched

90
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,840
places like Peru.

91
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:12,670
Then the consumption of money on the economic 
ground started.

92
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:20,880
Then the consumption of the Mother Earth started 
at the ‘Bhu’ level.

93
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,770
But the ‘Bhurva’ is the ‘Antariksha’ 
in the whole Universe.

94
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,340
We are going to the Sun, we are going to the 
moon, we are going to this, we are going to

95
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,340
that.

96
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,070
What about going inside in the ascent?

97
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:43,470
Now little bit they are seeing it that there’s 
intelligence also plus the energy.

98
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:51,520
But you are seeing it from the outside.

99
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,340
That’s the intelligence of God Almighty, 
whether you like it or not.

100
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:05,870
So now we are going to the ‘Antarikshas’, 
we are going to all these Universes to find

101
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,870
what?

102
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:14,750
So the ‘Bhurva’ is the essence – the 
‘Antariksha’.

103
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,700
Awareness reached there also.

104
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,930
Then it has gone further.

105
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:31,620
In the Sahaja Yoga we can say that from Nabhi 
chakra they started moving downwards towards

106
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:38,450
the Swadishthana, which deals with the Antariksha, 
with the Universes, which was created by the

107
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,760
Creator Brahmadeva.

108
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:51,631
Below that they moved again, comes the Mooladhara, 
which is the essence of human life, which

109
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:54,440
is the support of human life.

110
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,570
For which Christ Himself has said, “Thou 
shall not have adulterous eyes.

111
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:08,250
” I have yet to find real Christians of 
that kind who do not have adulterous eyes.

112
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:18,240
And that’s why people have gone to now nothing 
but they have become sex points, I can tell

113
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
you.

114
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:28,320
The whole awareness of your intellectual movement 
has gone to nothing but to this filth beyond

115
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Ganesha.

116
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,940
You have left everything that was holy, that 
was auspicious, much behind and crossed, and

117
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:43,250
one step forward and the hell is there, the 
hell.

118
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:50,210
Where our awareness is going today?

119
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:55,380
But we have not thought of the ‘urdvagati’ 
that Shri Krishna has said.

120
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:02,500
Giving lectures on Shri Krishna, having bhajans 
about Shri Krishna, makes no difference.

121
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,200
What about the urdvagati?

122
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,400
In the sixth century a great saint Gyaneshwara 
was born.

123
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:16,250
In the sixth chapter of Gyaneshwari He’s 
clearly described, is the Kundalini, which

124
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,510
is going to raise you higher, very clearly, 
openly He said it.

125
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,820
Of course as usual everybody tortured His 
life.

126
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:32,870
He didn’t have sometimes water to drink, 
that’s different.

127
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:40,130
In the sixth chapter when He described, even 
today in Maharashtra it is said that sixth

128
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,130
chapter is tabooed.

129
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,590
You are not supposed to read the sixth chapter 
of Gyaneshwari.

130
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,700
Why?

131
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:57,380
Because they don’t know a word about Kundalini 
and they don’t know how to ascend?

132
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:04,410
Because it is the knowledge of the roots you 
have to go to.

133
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:14,100
If you are honest please try to understand 
that what Shri Krishna has said that the roots

134
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:24,880
are in the brain and the awareness grows towards 
‘adhogati’.

135
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,280
He did not say precisely that Kundalini is 
the one that gives you the urdvagati.

136
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,670
He did not say; that was not the time.

137
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:40,130
At the time of war when He was talking about 
Dharma, He did not mention the word Kundalini

138
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:44,390
doesn’t mean that there was no device behind 
it.

139
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:51,760
Mark said that we would like to have a country 
without State.

140
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
How?

141
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,970
How will you have?

142
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:01,920
I’ve been to most of the Communist countries 
I think the state is very powerful.

143
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,220
The democrat said that we would like to have 
a free nation.

144
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,220
Free?

145
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,220
Abandonment.

146
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,500
It is demonacracy they are practicing.

147
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,900
If you want to deceive yourself and all the 
time, accept something that is falsehood nobody

148
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,460
can help you.

149
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:30,450
But the time is precarious and is important 
that we should see to the truth that the name

150
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:37,410
of democracy and the name of communism and 
the name of capitalism is just a myth.

151
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,750
It has not given what it had promised.

152
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:56,560
So let us come back to the Saints – to the 
deeper people, to the people who understood

153
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,750
life beyond life.

154
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:10,079
There we find the urdvagati, has to be, the 
ascent has to be achieved.

155
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,360
How, is the point?

156
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:24,779
Then later on Mohammad Saab also has talked 
about it, not that He has not talked; He’s

157
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,249
talked about the Resurrection.

158
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:30,759
He said that at the time of Resurrection your 
hands will speak.

159
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,220
Who’s bothered about that?

160
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,529
The whole Namaz is nothing but Kundalini raising.

161
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:43,669
But it leads to another kind of stupid fanaticism.

162
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:45,669
Christians are sophisticated fanatics.

163
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:48,700
Hindus are another type of fanatics.

164
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:55,279
Everybody is become a fanatic because it’s 
all a dead flower.

165
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,629
All these flowers grew on one tree of life.

166
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:07,309
They’ve been extracted, taken over as mine, 
mine, mine and they are all fighting about

167
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:08,990
it.

168
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:20,710
So it’s only the Kundalini awakening which 
is going to give you your Self-Realization

169
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:34,279
and this Self-Realization is going to let 
you know that you are a part and parcel of

170
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,330
the whole.

171
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,559
It’s not just a mental conception.

172
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,779
This is the point we miss every time.

173
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:50,769
All these democracies and capitalism and all 
these theories are mental projections of human

174
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:51,769
beings.

175
00:18:51,769 --> 00:19:01,730
All these mental projections are nothing but 
your own jails, your own bondages into which

176
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,539
you are caught up.

177
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:08,299
You have to get out of it.

178
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:16,370
Even to such an extent that people start saying 
that Adishankaracharya did not write Saundarya

179
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,370
Lahiri.

180
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,200
Who says that?

181
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,129
Intellectuals again.

182
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,059
What makes them think that he did not write?

183
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:27,090
They have explanations for everything.

184
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:34,529
But he did, which we can prove after Self-Realization.

185
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:41,820
How all the essence of all the religions are 
so much one can be proved only after Self-Realization

186
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,870
and not through discussions.

187
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:55,670
Because Self – the Spirit, is the absolute 
and is the collective being, that is not the

188
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,360
awakened within us.

189
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,879
One may say that why Buddha did not talk of 
God?

190
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:05,929
Because he knew human beings very well and 
he said, “No use talking about God, better

191
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:08,250
talk about Self-Realization”.

192
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,580
Same with Mahavira.

193
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:15,139
But what are the Buddhists and Mahaviris doing?

194
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:17,289
God alone knows.

195
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:19,450
Where are they?

196
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:29,350
But today is the time as described in the 
Puranas many, many seekers are born on Earth.

197
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:35,059
A special time is a time of real blossom.

198
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:39,490
Maybe in the olden day there were only one 
or two flowers like Nachiketa.

199
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:47,200
But today is the time when thousands are there 
just to become the fruit.

200
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:57,140
But unfortunately a market has been opened 
out where the seekers go and get lost.

201
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,210
Get lost into the convictions and the ideas 
of some other person which is gone into their

202
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,340
heads and they just finish off there.

203
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:09,860
Their seeking finishes off there, they end 
up as sick or obstinate people.

204
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:15,169
They do not want to go any further.

205
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:25,200
Shri Krishna is to be understood in Sahaja 
style.

206
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,860
Leela – He was Leeladhara.

207
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:37,890
In the Sahaja Yoga we believe that on the 
left hand side, the left sympathetic nervous

208
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:46,000
system is represented by the ‘Ida Nadi’ 
– which we call as also the ‘Chandra Nadi’

209
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,399
and the right hand side it is represented 
by the ‘Pingala Nadi’ – the right sympathetic.

210
00:21:53,399 --> 00:22:01,840
The left we use when we desire.

211
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,970
The right we use when we act.

212
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:13,119
The left is the ‘bhakti marga’ [path of 
devotion] and the right is the ‘karma marga’

213
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:18,970
[path of action] that they used for doing 
all kinds of yagnas and all that.

214
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:30,150
The central part of ascent is the ‘Sushumna’ 
is the path of dharma.

215
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:38,602
‘Dharaiti Sa dharma’ – means the one 
that is your sustenance is the Dharma.

216
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:46,610
It’s not an outside concept but an innate 
nature of human beings is the dharma.

217
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:51,730
This dharma we have achieved through evolutionary 
process, as you know ‘matsya rupa’ and

218
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,340
other things took place.

219
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,530
And afterwards we are today human beings.

220
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,390
But why?

221
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:04,669
Let us ask a question, simple question to 
ourselves ‘why are we here on this Earth?

222
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:07,259
To seek what?

223
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:12,259
To seek the truth and what is the truth?’

224
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:18,919
The truth is that you are the Spirit.

225
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:28,840
Not this bhakti, not this karma.

226
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,269
But you are the Spirit.

227
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:40,100
Now Shri Krishna’s diplomacy can be seen 
very clearly, if you want to see even, even

228
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,139
without Self-Realization.

229
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:47,340
He says for bhakti [devotion] – “patram” 
[leaf], “pushpam” [flower], “phalam”

230
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,200
[fruit], “toyam” [water].

231
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,129
All these things you give it to Him, He’ll 
accept.

232
00:23:53,129 --> 00:24:01,360
But see the diplomacy on one word He has played 
the whole people and nobody has seen the point.

233
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,279
What does He say?

234
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:08,619
He says that you have to do ‘ananya bhakti’.

235
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:13,000
‘Ananya’ shabda [word] itself means, the 
word itself means when there is not the other;

236
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,639
means you are a realized soul.

237
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:20,220
Logically let us see what does it mean?

238
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,919
If there is no connection with God whom are 
you praying to?

239
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,840
The connection has to be established.

240
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:34,570
You may go on describing God as a myth, you 
may go on supporting Him doing anything you

241
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,570
like.

242
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:45,080
But you have not yet been connected with Him 
what are you talking?

243
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,899
Something in the air.

244
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:51,159
‘Ananya bhakti’.

245
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,000
Now about karma, see the diplomacy.

246
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,429
If you keep your mind open as a scientist 
you’ll see My point clearly.

247
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:11,070
For that He says that do your karmas but put 
the fruit of your doing at the Lotus Feet

248
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,260
of the Lord.

249
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:20,539
This is the absurd condition; is not possible, 
cannot be done.

250
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:22,759
Before Realization you cannot do this.

251
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:27,870
Many people come to Me, “Yes Mother You 
know whatever we are doing, we are putting

252
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:33,379
at the Lotus Feet of the God” – black 
marketing, everything.

253
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:37,600
What does that mean?

254
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,279
That you put it at the Lotus Feet of the Lord, 
that you are no more there.

255
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:54,299
It’s only after Realization you realize, 
that a Sahaja Yogi would tell you, he doesn’t

256
00:25:54,299 --> 00:26:00,679
say, “I give him Realization”, he doesn’t 
say that, “I am moving his Kundalini.

257
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:05,669
” What he says, “It is not moving, It 
is not coming up.

258
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:06,669
”

259
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:12,600
There was a lady who traveled with Me to America 
once and her son came all the way from Honalulu,

260
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,389
a very rich man and all those things.

261
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:18,200
So he could not get his Realization.

262
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,609
So she came to Me and said, “Mother, give 
him the Realization.

263
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:24,609
”

264
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:25,609
I said, “You give him.

265
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:26,609
”

266
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:27,609
She said, “No, no, no I cannot give him.

267
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:28,609
”

268
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:29,610
So I said, “I can’t give him either, the 
Kundalini doesn’t move what to do?

269
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:34,169
Then give him a false certificate you are 
a realized soul.

270
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:38,700
He can say ‘born again’ or sort of a nonsense 
he can go about, talking about.

271
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,700
”

272
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,139
She said, “No, no how can you give such 
a false certificate?”

273
00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:45,139
I said, “That’s it.

274
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:52,570
If the Kundalini has not risen if it is not 
broken the Brahmarandra we cannot even say

275
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,770
it is awakened, leave alone calling him a 
Sahaja Yogi.

276
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,770
”

277
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,770
She agreed there.

278
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,100
You cannot give a false certificate about 
it.

279
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:07,019
That’s what happens when you do your karmas.

280
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:09,320
You don’t say that you are doing it.

281
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,509
It’s done ‘it’ in the third; like small 
children always talk like that.

282
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:18,289
“Mother this boy Munna wont listen, is a 
bad one.

283
00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:22,642
” In the third person they talk so many 
times you must’ve seen.

284
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:31,399
In the same way a realized soul always talks 
in the third person.

285
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:37,119
That’s the different world in which they 
have lived and they have been very, very few

286
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:46,450
tortured, and never understood by the people 
who were ruling or the people who were the

287
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:51,190
intellectuals or whose who were the priests.

288
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:57,130
And the public was helplessly watching all 
their tortures.

289
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:02,860
In Maharashtra we have a great saint called 
Namdev.

290
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:13,139
Very great saint – Namdeva, he was a tailor, 
ordinary tailor and when this tailor went

291
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:22,809
to see another saint whose name was Gorakumbhar 
– is a potter.

292
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:33,909
The words he says is so beautiful which you 
can understand with little subtler feelings

293
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:36,870
about it.

294
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:43,679
He says, “Nirgunachya bheti aalo sagunashi” 
– I came here to meet the nirguna – the

295
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,769
formless and here is standing in the form.

296
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:52,330
Where do you find these talks these days?

297
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:58,529
If two great meet they go with swords, with 
pistols.

298
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:10,309
Here he goes and talks to a potter that I 
came to see the ‘nirakara’, the ‘nirguna’

299
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:14,059
– the formless and here it is in the form.

300
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:15,710
But he was a tailor.

301
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:21,249
How can be a tailor a realized soul?

302
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:33,240
And when Namdeva went to Punjab Shri Nanak 
Saab gave Him all the honor of a saint and

303
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:40,090
told Him that He should also write some beautiful 
verses because He compiled the Granth Saab

304
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:49,260
out of all the realized souls poems – that 
You compile the poems in Punjabi or Hindi.

305
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:56,060
Namadeva, coming from such a far-fetched place 
He studied Hindi and Punjabi and you’ll

306
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:03,919
be amazed that half of His book, which is 
so big is in Hindi or in Punjabi language.

307
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,490
For that you need Shri Nanaka who can recognize.

308
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:15,860
But today seekers run after somebody who pampers 
their ego, where you can pay some money, where

309
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:21,960
you can befool you by getting some Rolls Royces 
or some sort of a Geeta pravachana [discourse]

310
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:28,019
he gives or gives you some sort of a name 
in the ear so that you become mad.

311
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:35,940
This is the quality of the seekers, which 
I have to face.

312
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:43,129
Whatever it is, the concern is so great; whatever 
is the quality today it has to happen, it

313
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:44,919
has to work out.

314
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:53,929
Which one now I heard to My complete surprise 
that now people – the intellectuals are

315
00:30:53,929 --> 00:31:02,580
propounding, that the Namadeva who came from 
Maharashtra was not the same as the Namadeva

316
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:09,039
who was a tailor because he was not an intellectual.

317
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:18,129
I am talking about the unlimited not about 
the limited.

318
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:25,419
Like in any one of your spacecrafts you have 
different cylinders, which explode one after

319
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:30,639
another and accelerate the one, which comes.

320
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:37,899
First one will explode and accelerate the 
second one; the second one will explode and

321
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:39,919
accelerate the third one.

322
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:52,960
In the same way the intellect is to be exploded 
to go into the space, to jump into the space,

323
00:31:52,960 --> 00:32:00,999
is the most important thing that the intellect 
has to leave its limitedness to the unlimited

324
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:04,539
intelligence, which covers the whole universe.

325
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:15,119
That is the ‘Brahma Shakti’ described, 
that’s the All-Pervading Power of God, that

326
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,509
is the power of love of God.

327
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:22,150
And is such a tremendous one where Shri Krishna 
Himself has said ‘Yogakshema Vahamyaham’.

328
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,150
First He said ‘yoga’.

329
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,739
Why did He not say ‘Kshema Yoga’?

330
00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:31,549
Many people ask Me in the West that how is 
it in Your country there’s so much of poverty

331
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:36,249
and that You talk that it’s a Yoga bhumi?

332
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:41,389
Because we have not taken to yoga so far.

333
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:49,519
And Kshema doesn’t mean how may pubs you 
have in your village, it doesn’t mean how

334
00:32:49,519 --> 00:33:00,010
many drunkards move about in your village, 
it means, how many saints there are in your

335
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,010
country.

336
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:05,619
Let the Yoga come up, you’ll be surprised 
this great country of Bharat Bhoomi will one

337
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:08,679
day show its merit to the whole world.

338
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:19,419
In its reality, in its glory and in its Divinity 
which resides in this country.

339
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:25,179
You are great people that you are born in 
this country but you don’t know, you have

340
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:28,460
no idea as to where you are born?

341
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,179
What is your heritage?

342
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:38,619
There are people I’ve met very surprisingly 
so

343
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:52,909
stupefied by Hegle and Kant and all such people 
that they believe that all these saints and

344
00:33:52,909 --> 00:34:02,639
all these great people including Krishna or 
Rama, all of them are false.

345
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:09,020
This is the height of arrogance and ignorance 
both put together because they are ignorant

346
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,030
one has to forgive them, there’s no way 
out.

347
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:26,260
God is the ocean of love, ocean of praise, 
ocean of wisdom, ocean of this All-Pervading

348
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:43,789
Power, which is so efficient, so kind, so 
understanding, works out everything so well.

349
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:49,640
But above all He is the ocean of forgiveness 
I can tell you.

350
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:55,879
I really tell you in My experience, I feel 
this forgiveness is so greatly effective today

351
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:00,900
otherwise I don’t think I could’ve managed 
this job so well.

352
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,630
May God bless you all.

353
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:15,270
As a Mother I’ve try to explain and express 
My concern.

354
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,270
Try to understand.

355
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:22,730
It is Sahaja – is born with you, ‘Sahaja’ 
– ‘saha’ means with, ‘ja’ – born.

356
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:27,750
It’s your fundamental right as a human being 
to get your Self-Realization.

357
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:32,260
But if you want to deny it because you have 
some convictions because you are following

358
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:37,900
certain people, because you think this is 
all right we don’t want to have Self-Realization.

359
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,589
God is not going to fall at your feet.

360
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:45,670
You have to ask for it.

361
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,790
You have to knock at the door and the door 
will be opened.

362
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:57,990
In Sahaja Yoga we can prove today that there’s 
no quarrel between Moses and Christ, there

363
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:06,100
is no quarrel between Christ and Mohammad 
Saab and there is no quarrel between Mohammad

364
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,180
Saab and Shri Krishna.

365
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,140
They are all one together.

366
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:16,009
As Christ has clearly said, “Those who are 
not against Me are with Me.

367
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:18,460
” Who wants to see that?

368
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,940
Who are those?

369
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:29,450
Christ was not even allowed to work out for 
more than three and half years.

370
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:35,140
It took Me four years to give Realization 
to seven English men.

371
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,390
So you can imagine what must be His plight?

372
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:42,650
Three and a half years with all the mad people 
around.

373
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,690
But not in our villages.

374
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:51,700
Yesterday I went to Jaipur; first we had a 
big meeting in a big sophisticated hall and

375
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,190
all this and this, My Indian English.

376
00:36:55,190 --> 00:37:01,170
I was trying to explain to them and I thought 
it’s all gone over their heads; nothing

377
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,849
went inside or maybe under their feet.

378
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:11,910
Then I said, “Let’s go to a place where 
ordinary people live.

379
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:17,170
And there I found thousands thronging together 
to get their Self-Realization.

380
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:23,450
They don’t want money, they don’t want 
power, they don’t want anything, they don’t

381
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,569
want any conviction, they want their Self-Realization.

382
00:37:26,569 --> 00:37:28,799
“Maa humko atma bodh dijiye.

383
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:30,130
Humko atma gyan.

384
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:38,080
” They understand that ‘bodha’ doesn’t 
mean lecturing, it doesn’t mean, it means

385
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:43,230
on your central nervous system you have to 
feel the All-Pervading Power – that is ‘bodha’,

386
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,920
that is the “vidh” which is described 
in the Vedas.

387
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,299
They understand; they live with the life, 
they are natural people.

388
00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:54,849
They know all this talking is on and on and 
on.

389
00:37:54,849 --> 00:38:00,660
They know something has to happen and the 
second thing they said was so encouraging

390
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,200
– “Ke Maa parivartan hona chahiye ham 
mein” – we should be transformed.

391
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,550
It’s not our mental idea that we have become 
some great yogi, this, that.

392
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,819
We should be transformed.

393
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:16,910
I said, “Not only transformed but you’ll 
have your powers as realized souls”.

394
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:25,600
By God’s grace even in Delhi, which is supposed 
to be the most sophisticated place where after

395
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:32,640
English left we became merry more, much more 
westernized; when they were here we were better

396
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
off.

397
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:45,470
And in this place also I find there are so 
many great Sahaja Yogis who are now completely

398
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:54,339
endowed with the power of Realization, of 
curing, of doing all the things that can be

399
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:59,309
done as a yogi.

400
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:04,480
I hope today all of you will get your Realization, 
but you have to establish yourself.

401
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:15,330
It’s just a wee bit of your Kundalini, I 
should say like a hair comes out through the

402
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:23,140
Brahma Nadi, but with humility, abhyase [practice], 
for few days you establish yourself.

403
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:31,060
Of course today you might get your ‘nirvichar 
samadhi’ [thoughtless awareness] just like

404
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,280
that, maybe.

405
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,460
But you’ll have to establish your ‘nirvikalpa’ 
[doubtless awareness].

406
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:41,609
You must give some time to yourself and some 
respect to your Self-Realization and to yourself

407
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:42,609
[pratigya?

408
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:43,609
– It’s not pratigya but can’t make out 
the word said by Shri Mataji].

409
00:39:43,609 --> 00:39:43,613
May God bless you.
