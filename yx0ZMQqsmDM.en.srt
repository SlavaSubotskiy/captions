1
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:17,265
So, this last center,

2
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:27,586
 the Sahastrara, is contained in the limbic area of the brain.

3
00:00:34,483 --> 00:00:40,408
Our head is like a coconut.

4
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:47,471
The coconut has the hair, and then a hard nut

5
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:51,555
and then a black covering

6
00:00:51,755 --> 00:01:01,358
and inside is white shell

7
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,668
of coconut and inside is the space, the water.

8
00:01:08,123 --> 00:01:12,494
In the same way, our brain is made.

9
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:16,963
That's why coconut is called as Shreephala.

10
00:01:17,163 --> 00:01:28,277
Is the fruit of the power that is Shree.

11
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:34,980
Shree power is the right side power

12
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,847
and the left side power is the Lalita power.

13
00:01:40,047 --> 00:01:45,605
So, we have two Chakras - left side, here, is the Lalita

14
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:52,503
and right side, here, is the Shree Chakra.

15
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:59,144
These two Chakras are working out

16
00:01:59,344 --> 00:02:02,605
the right side Mahasaraswati's power

17
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:07,945
and left side Mahakali's powers.

18
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:16,660
Now, the central power is the Kundalini.

19
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,629
That has to rise and penetrate through different Chakras,

20
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:31,949
enter into the limbic area and enlighten the seven Pithas -

21
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:36,012
seats of these seven Chakras.

22
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:39,575
So, it penetrates through six Chakras,

23
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:45,950
enters into the limbic area,

24
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:54,556
enlightens all the seven Pithas in the brain,

25
00:02:54,756 --> 00:03:01,001
which are placed along the mid-line of the limbic area.

26
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:05,329
So, we start it from the back, is placed here,

27
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:09,977
at the back, is the Mooladhara Chakra.

28
00:03:10,177 --> 00:03:16,625
Around it is the Swadishthana,

29
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:21,977
then is the Nabhi, then the Heart,

30
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:26,735
then the Vishuddhi and then the Agnya.

31
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:33,258
So, all these six centers are combining

32
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:37,024
to make the seventh center.

33
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:41,454
This is a very important point, which we should know.

34
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:45,226
Now, the Shree Chakra is the right side working

35
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:49,515
and the Lalita Chakra is the left side working.

36
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:55,953
So, when the Kundalini doesn't rise

37
00:03:56,154 --> 00:04:01,508
then we do with our right side

38
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,258
our physical and mental activities.

39
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,992
So our brain is doing right side activity

40
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:14,560
and that's why our brain is like Shreephala.

41
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:23,812
Sahastrara is actually

42
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:30,289
is the assemblage of these six Chakras

43
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,023
and is a hollow space,

44
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:37,820
on the sides of it there are one thousand Nadis.

45
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:44,414
And when the light penetrates into the limbic area,

46
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:52,593
then the enlightenment of these Nadis take place

47
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:56,241
and you can see them as flames,

48
00:04:56,442 --> 00:05:00,327
very gentle flames burning

49
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:04,140
and these flames have all the seven colors

50
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:09,864
that you see in the vibjyor.

51
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:16,702
But the last one, ultimately becomes again integrated

52
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:19,890
and it is a crystal clear flame.

53
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:27,122
All these seven lights ultimately become crystal clear.

54
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:32,952
So, you have Sahastrara with one thousand petals,

55
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:35,874
as they called it,

56
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:41,913
but if you cut the brain in a transverse section

57
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:46,483
or horizontal section, you will be able to see

58
00:05:46,684 --> 00:05:51,819
that all these nerves are built like this

59
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,546
along the limbic area, all of them are like a petal,

60
00:05:56,747 --> 00:06:02,288
and if you cut it like this, you will find that

61
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:10,051
there are many nerves in every bundle of nerves.

62
00:06:11,357 --> 00:06:13,744
So, when it is enlightened,

63
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:27,780
you can see Sahastrara as a burning bundle of flames.
