1
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,920
Now the essence of Sahaja Yoga,

2
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,280
I am sure Mr. Gavin Brown must have explained to you what it is.

3
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,000
And so many of you are from Sahaja Yoga itself.

4
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,920
So I need not explain to you all the details.

5
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,600
But today we have to understand one thing

6
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,520
that it’s a very serious time we are born into, extremely serious.

7
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,280
And when we look at life

8
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,280
we do not understand that

9
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,120
if we miss this chance of our evolution,

10
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,520
not only that we’ll miss it for ourselves,

11
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,080
not only that we’ll miss it for England,

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,520
or only for one country,

13
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,640
but we’ll miss it for the whole creation.

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,520
The trouble is, in the name of God,

15
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,760
in the name of evolution,

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,800
in the name of higher life,

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,320
so many spurious people have come up

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,240
that it has become impossible to convince anyone

19
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,160
that there is something like truth left in it.

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,320
Under these circumstances,

21
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,120
one has to talk about truth

22
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,480
and talking about truth

23
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,120
doesn’t give you the experience of the truth at all.

24
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,080
Discussing about it will not give you,

25
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,280
it’s a different realm in which one has to go into,

26
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,280
it’s a new awareness which you have to get,

27
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,320
to understand the truth,

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,640
for which I don’t know how many are prepared,

29
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,480
and how many would like to know,

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,040
and even if they like to know, how many will get it.

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,120
So the problem is the other way round.

32
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,080
It’s not the problem that you have few people,

33
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,640
it’s not the problem

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,440
that Sahaja Yoga cannot give you realization,

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,160
it’s not the problem that you will not know the truth,

36
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,880
but the whole circumstance is such,

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,400
that whatever is false, whatever is spurious,

38
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,040
whatever is silly, stupid, appeals to the masses.

39
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,880
Sometimes I feel I have developed a method

40
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,120
by which I can give really en masse realization

41
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,560
all over the world,

42
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,600
definitely I have.

43
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,840
But the problem as it remains,

44
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,080
the masses are not interested.

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,600
It’s only very few who really can keenly take interest

46
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,240
into their evolutionary process

47
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,720
and would like to come out of the ignorance

48
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,600
in which they have been living.

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,400
In all the ego-oriented countries

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,400
it’s very difficult to establish

51
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,440
that we are still ignorant,

52
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,800
we have to know a lot. It’s very difficult.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,640
Because they think we know everything,

54
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,560
because we have been to the moon. Like the Russians say,

55
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,400
‘We never saw God, we went to the moon, we never saw God.’

56
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,920
It would be like saying that I have come

57
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,720
to the third floor, I haven’t seen God.

58
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,000
Where does God reside? Where it manifest within us?

59
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,880
In what way it manifest, we don’t want to see.

60
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,040
What we want to see is that through our effort,

61
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,880
if we have not been able to see God, then He doesn’t exist.

62
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,640
This is the way our attitude is,

63
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,920
that better say, 'No,' to all that we did not know

64
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,240
through our effort,

65
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,920
because so far we have not known about Him.

66
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,600
So He doesn’t exist.

67
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,480
So you turn round in a cave

68
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,480
when you see the shadows of yourself,

69
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,880
you believe in them only and say,

70
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,760
“It never existed anything else, the light does not exist.”

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,400
That kind of an attitude exists

72
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,600
or is persistently I am facing.

73
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:14,320
And sometimes, I don’t know how to give them realization.

74
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,000
Now as I said, it’s the other way round.

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,240
You have to seek. You have to ask for it.

76
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,640
You have to truly ask for it.

77
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,920
Nobody is going to fall at your feet and say,

78
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
‘All right, you get your realization.

79
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,920
All right, you have this for heaven’s sake!'

80
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,600
Just have it!

81
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,720
Because nothing is selling here.

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,240
We are so much used to the salesmanship, you see,

83
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,800
that we think that if anything is selling,

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,840
people have to persuade you, to request you, ask you,

85
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,160
you can save pounds, you see, for sale and all that.

86
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,160
But nothing is for sale.

87
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,640
That’s a very difficult proposition to understand

88
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,240
in the present atmosphere,

89
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,480
where we do not know if you can get anything that is not for sale.

90
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,800
But, I hope slowly and steadily,

91
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,360
all of us have to get it.

92
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,720
Somehow, one has to work very hard. Sometimes it’s very frustrating

93
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,120
and it’s so stupid, the way people react,

94
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,800
that I just don’t know what to say.

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,880
Like the other day we had a meeting in Brighton.

96
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,920
I was laughing all the time. But so saddening.

97
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,040
A gentleman came to our program

98
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,560
and he complained, he thought, he said,

99
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,400
‘I was videoed.’

100
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,320
See, who has got time here to put him for a video,

101
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,200
who is interested in taking his photographs? I mean,

102
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,240
he says, ‘I am a managing director.’ So what?

103
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,800
In the presence of Divine, what is a managing director,

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,640
what is a king, what is it? Just think of it. Who is he?

105
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,760
What does he think of himself and he has complained against us.

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,440
I hope he doesn’t go to police for that.

107
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,680
Even the laws are so stupid sometimes, I can’t understand,

108
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,920
how has he got any right to complain if you come to a program

109
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,880
which is being conducted with a video on Me

110
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,080
and if you are photographed, how can you complain?

111
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:46,440
One thing I feel that on one side is such stupid,

112
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:54,600
useless people, the other side are such great seekers.

113
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,920
And how to reach them?

114
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,680
Like a diamond covered with lot of mud.

115
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,840
So much mud. It’s all mud.

116
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,240
In that to find out those diamonds,

117
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,920
to dive into this mire of ignorance,

118
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,000
to get out these diamonds which are lost.

119
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,200
It’s such a concern, that I feel sometimes

120
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,520
that this mud is going to cover their brains, their ego,

121
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,680
everything, and they may not receive their realization.

122
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,280
They may miss this point.

123
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,600
Actually, Divine does not know what human beings have created.

124
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,240
Really, I tell you,

125
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,600
Divine has no ideas what nonsense you have created around.

126
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,320
All kinds of nonsense you have created

127
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,640
out of your ignorance, out of your ego,

128
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,560
out of your choice that you had.

129
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,360
I can’t explain why people have created this kind of ignorance

130
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,600
which cannot be broken, cannot be removed.

131
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,200
Because they are so much identified.

132
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,600
It’s like a stuck-up stamp which cannot come out of people.

133
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,720
And when such a thing happens

134
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,720
you feel, Oh, God!`'

135
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,240
The whole creation has been created,

136
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,040
whole working has taken place,

137
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,000
the human beings have grown so well,

138
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,920
out of a amoeba they have been brought to this stage.

139
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,240
Now in these modern times you find the human beings so stupid,

140
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,240
so foolish,

141
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,280
and deluding others with their stupidity and foolishness.

142
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,280
How are we to approach the people who are true seekers,

143
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,400
have been seekers for ages,

144
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,440
those who have sought for years together,

145
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,600
all their lives before, who are lost?

146
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,680
Sometimes it is very, very disappointing.

147
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,400
But still, hoping against hopes,

148
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,080
I hope we reach all the corners

149
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,200
of this universe where we find

150
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,640
all the people who are true seekers.

151
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,000
It is their right to know,

152
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,480
it is their power to know the Divine.

153
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,600
It’s not for everybody because he’s somebody is a managing director

154
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,640
or a king or anything. What does it matter?

155
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,520
In the presence of God, they’ll be pushed out.

156
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,160
They will not be allowed to enter into the kingdom of God.

157
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,000
Who will be allowed to enter into the kingdom of God?

158
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,880
Those who have known.

159
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,880
Also, not those who just talk about God.

160
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,840
Those who say that

161
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,520
‘We are the worshippers of God, we have learned so much’.

162
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,120
They will say, “All right, go with your books

163
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,120
to the places from where you have come.’

164
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,920
What have you to know is through your awareness,

165
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,680
in your awareness you have to know.

166
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,720
The awareness has to be enlightened.

167
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,600
It is not, what you know with this human awareness,

168
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,200
which is still at a point, I say, has to grow so much.

169
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,280
First it has to be awakened

170
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,840
and then it has to grow in its light.

171
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,480
It’s such a lot of journey we have to do

172
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,880
even after realization.

173
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,360
It takes no time sometimes to give realization to many people.

174
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,200
I know it has happened with so many.

175
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,600
But they don’t know what they have to achieve.

176
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,200
It’s such a horrible stuff is this ego is,

177
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,000
that people don’t want to see what they haven’t got with them,

178
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,920
and what they have to hide, have and what they, they deserve.

179
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,360
They are so identified with ego and satisfied with it,

180
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,440
that they don’t want to see that beauty that lies within them,

181
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,720
the spirit, the reflection of God’s Love

182
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,400
which is like the highest and the most precious thing

183
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,920
that you could think of.

184
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,520
In this England,

185
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,080
I don’t know how many lectures I have given

186
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,360
and how much I have worked hard.

187
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,040
Of course there are results, no doubt. But it is so slow.

188
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,680
Compared to the fake,

189
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,320
compared to the artificial people,

190
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,280
compared to the people who have made money out of you,

191
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,320
those who have exploited you,

192
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,040
have ruined you,

193
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,880
Sahaja Yoga is working so very slowly.

194
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,800
I would not have been so much disappointed

195
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,840
if it was at the time of Christ

196
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,480
because at that time there were very few seekers.

197
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,880
Actually even the fishermen who Christ collected, were not seekers.

198
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,400
You are seekers of the truth.

199
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,920
And so many of you have taken birth

200
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,080
just to seek the truth.

201
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,320
And where are we going? What are we doing about it?

202
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,280
What are our ideas about the truth?

203
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:53,800
Can we have our own

204
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,920
ideas, conception about the truth?

205
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,720
Is it not that our ego itself has given us lots of ideas?

206
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,360
Is it not that we do not want to see the truth?

207
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,720
I meet all kinds of people in this country.

208
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,400
I must say they are very highly placed, very great,

209
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,520
somebody is a lord and somebody is a lady

210
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,080
and somebody is another huge personality, and this and that.

211
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,400
But, they said, ‘ Who wants to change? ’

212
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,400
I said, “Really. That’s true.”

213
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,120
Because they think they are the greatest people ever born

214
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,280
and they’re going to take all their lordship with them to the heaven.

215
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,000
They said, ‘Who wants to change? ’

216
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,720
I said then, "Such a lot can be said on the point,

217
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
but if you don’t want to change,

218
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,320
that’s a full stop, complete full stop."

219
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,480
You cannot talk to them.

220
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,720
Now this, I must say is -

221
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:04,120
only can work out with people who are seekers,

222
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,680
who want to know, through their awareness, what is the truth.

223
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,560
You have to know your spirit.

224
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,640
Without knowing your spirit, you cannot know what is the truth.

225
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,520
Whatever I may talk to you is a waste, complete waste

226
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,200
because you haven’t got that awareness today,

227
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,000
to know what I am talking about.

228
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,080
So, first thing is: I request you to become the spirit.

229
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,200
Is simple thing as that.

230
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:46,680
Like now I have to see into your skin for example,

231
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,240
I’ll have to use a microscope.

232
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,720
And then people will say, ‘All right,you see through the microscope

233
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,360
you cannot see with your naked eyes.’

234
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,720
All right? Supposing I want to listen to somebody’s heart,

235
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,240
then people will say, ‘Use a stethoscope,

236
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,840
otherwise you cannot listen to somebody’s heart.’

237
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,520
All right. You don’t question that time do you,

238
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,560
you just put it there and try to listen.

239
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,520
In the same way, why not we do about the spirit,

240
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,600
why not we do what it is told to you,

241
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,720
that you have to get your realization,

242
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,800
that you have to become the spirit first,

243
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,360
that unless and until this awareness is enlightened

244
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,880
by the spirit, you cannot see.

245
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,160
Is like telling something about the coulors to a blind,

246
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,280
you have to open your eyes,

247
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,000
but this simple thing also people don’t accept.

248
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,080
The reason is people are very naive.

249
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,000
They don’t know, what is it,

250
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,920
and also they don’t want to understand.

251
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,720
Now as you see a tree standing there

252
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,000
and so many trees are there,

253
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,000
you must also know, that there are roots to it.

254
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,440
But somebody has told you there are roots.

255
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,200
You may not believe into it, but why not see, is the point.

256
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,040
Why not see if there are roots or not?

257
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,080
Supposing I say, “ Whatever you are outside,

258
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,800
you are much more inside.”

259
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,880
So why not we see it?

260
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,280
This is a simple question we should ask ourselves,

261
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,240
‘Why should I put any barrier to that seeing,

262
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,080
if that is going to give me all the best in this world?

263
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,640
If it is going to give me

264
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,680
even the inkling

265
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,320
of that beautiful thing called spirit,

266
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,320
why not have it?’

267
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,280
You don’t have to pay for it, you don’t have to exert for it,

268
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,080
you don’t have to do anything, but you have to desire.

269
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,000
This is the point I am trying to make,

270
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,120
that if you do not desire from your heart,

271
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,400
then God is not going to fall at your feet,

272
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,680
now please desire for Me, is He?

273
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,400
It’s a simple thing like that

274
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,920
and if you people understand

275
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,640
that you have to really desire it,

276
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,600
because it’s such a vicious circle I must tell you,

277
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,280
that this kundalini - is not here the picture -

278
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:38,440
the kundalini is the pure desire within you.

279
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,880
Is the desire which is not yet manifested,

280
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,040
it is not yet awakened in the sense that it is acting,

281
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,440
but it has not acted.

282
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,480
So, if so, how much important it is

283
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,080
that you should have the desire

284
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,280
to be one with the Divine, to be in Yoga,

285
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,720
to be one with your spirit.

286
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,160
The desire has to be strong,

287
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,400
if it is not a strong desire

288
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,600
you are challenging your own kundalini, you are anti-kundalini

289
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,080
and then the kundalini won’t rise.

290
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,000
But what is this brain has achieved so far, just look at it.

291
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,880
You must understand, what have we achieved by this brain?

292
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,440
For example, this stupid managing director whosoever came there,

293
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,280
just ask him what good has he done to anyone?

294
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,200
What does he know about spiritual life?

295
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,880
What does he understand about Christ’s life?’

296
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,680
But if he sends a letter,

297
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,800
the newspaper is very willing to write it down.

298
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,920
I mean look at the stupidity of the whole stuff.

299
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,520
Without understanding that anything that has to go to the masses

300
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,320
should be something sensible, from a sensible man,

301
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,920
who is supposed to be an authority

302
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,520
on spiritual life that he is talking about.

303
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,160
What good this fellow has done, nobody reads that.

304
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,280
But if I write something or any Sahaja Yogi says that, "see

305
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,640
by coming to Sahaja Yoga we dropped down all our bad habits,

306
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,720
I got cured of my cancer" or anything

307
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,400
nobody wants to listen to you. They think you are mad.

308
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,520
But a man like that, if he writes, then they publish it.

309
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,880
So it shows very clearly

310
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,200
that you see we are living with people

311
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,080
who are really not only mad but are absolutely foolish people,

312
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,320
who have no sense at all as to how they have to live

313
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,440
and how they have to move.

314
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,560
This is what we have come to know about so many people now,

315
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,360
that sometimes you people have to take upon yourself

316
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,880
to go into it and find out what is the truth.

317
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,200
It is you who have to find it out.

318
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,560
You see, it would be something like that, I say now,

319
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,480
`This is a place where there are lots of diamonds',

320
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,560
say, I say that. Or:`This is a cave in which,

321
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,920
if you move there is a lot of, say - gold.'

322
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,160
Now the gold is not going to come out from there, is it?

323
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,720
Simple as that.

324
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,360
You have to go towards the gold to find it out or not.

325
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,080
You have to go towards it,

326
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,360
but here I’m not saying that you walk towards anything

327
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,440
or do anything like that, just you have to desire,

328
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,000
and desire it from your heart.

329
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,880
Is impossible for me to work out kundalini

330
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,000
if you do not desire, because the desire,

331
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,840
the pure desire, is the kundalini.

332
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,160
You understand My problem is now. Pure desire is the kundalini

333
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,120
and if you are against your pure desire,

334
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,160
what can I do about it? Can I force it?

335
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,680
You cannot push it out, you see? Like a seed,

336
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,200
if you have to, if you want to have a seed sprouted,

337
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,240
you have to put it in the Mother Earth,

338
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,720
but you cannot take it out

339
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,840
the bits of the seed and sprout it, can you?

340
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,920
It’s a living process and for this living process

341
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,000
you have to have a pure desire.

342
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,560
And if that desire is not there,

343
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,480
I am breaking My head against stones, I feel.

344
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,240
So it is important that you understand

345
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,640
that you must have that desire which is the highest.

346
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,840
But if you are satisfied with things

347
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,160
which are useless and nonsensical,

348
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,200
then what am I to do with that?

349
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Now you just tell Me with someone

350
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,240
who is interested in things which are nonsensical,

351
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,160
now how do you bring them round?

352
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,360
I mean, there is no psychology that can bring them round,

353
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,480
you see, because you have to have the desire to be all right.

354
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,440
But this is something so innate,

355
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,280
being the process itself is a living process

356
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,920
and doesn’t work out

357
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,320
if the people do not have the pure desire.

358
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,040
Now this written down since long.

359
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,560
It cannot be changed, it cannot be forced,

360
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,280
it cannot be sort of explained or discussed,

361
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,280
or argued, nothing can be done; it has to work out within you.

362
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,400
Now even when you have worked it out on someone,

363
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,840
you may not achieve the results. That’s possible.

364
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,200
You may, you may not.

365
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,560
So, when the situation is so difficult

366
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,600
and where the children are also so adamant,

367
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,320
then what can Mother do?

368
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,160
Is to push them in.

369
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,200
See, I am very much concerned,

370
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,560
that this ego which is sometimes so selfish

371
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,440
and so conceited,

372
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,200
that it satisfies itself and it’s very happy,

373
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,240
it will not allow you to get to the, that point

374
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,040
where you really stand, where you have all your powers,

375
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,120
where you are the master of your being. It will not allow.

376
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,360
The identification with the ego is so much,

377
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,360
that’s easy to take a bull by the horn

378
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,040
but to take an ego-oriented man through Sahaja Yoga’s practices

379
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,840
is very difficult.

380
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:19,120
I am rather today in a mood of,

381
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,720
I should say little disgust, I should say,

382
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,000
but also the other mood comes on me

383
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,800
of complete compassion and tremendous love.

384
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,760
That somehow I should do something to bring

385
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,080
sense into the heads of these people.

386
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,560
Something should happen to them

387
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,640
because otherwise what I see is a complete disaster.

388
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,400
It’s going to come, believe Me, it’s going to come.

389
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,080
I don’t want to frighten you like Mrs. Thatcher does about Russians.

390
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,720
That might be imaginary. But this is real and I am telling you

391
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,840
it’s going to come to us. It will come as diseases, selfdestruction.

392
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,560
But the greatest thing is the failure of the Divine Itself

393
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,920
that it could not communicate with you people,

394
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,040
who were made specially,

395
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,240
who were brought to this earth on this time,

396
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,880
who have to have the kingdom of heaven.

397
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,880
And suddenly you find they all dropped out of the sieve.

398
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,200
Sahaja Yogis also sometimes feel very frustrated, I know.

399
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,400
But whatever it is, as far as I am concerned,

400
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,720
I have tremendous desire now.

401
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,920
But I am so desireless, that this desire also may not work out.

402
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,000
You see, I am a desireless person.

403
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,440
Now what to do?

404
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,120
So I ask Sahaja Yogis to desire

405
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,720
that the people should have that great desire

406
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,920
to become the spirit.

407
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,720
This is the greatest thing

408
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,360
that we can give to our brothers and sisters,

409
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,240
to the progeny, to the people who are children today,

410
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,840
to this beautiful world.

411
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,760
We need these beautiful lights

412
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,720
and the beautiful time which they all have to enjoy.

413
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,680
I hope those who have come for the first time

414
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,920
will understand My difficulty

415
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,680
and will try to see that you desire

416
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,880
only your Self-realization and nothing else.

417
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,440
Just desire that. I request you to desire your Self-realization

418
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,360
and forget about everything, even if you are managing director

419
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,000
or may be the King George the Vth, you see?

420
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,760
Better keep all your shoes outside about it,

421
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,480
and just desire that you become the spirit.

422
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:03,640
You see the difference between Me and Christ is here:

423
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,720
He got so fed up that He said, "Let Me be crucified."

424
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,120
I mean of course it was in the plan that He should be crucified also

425
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,240
but I mean that won’t solve the problem now.

426
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,000
I have to see that you all get your resurrection somehow.

427
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,840
It’s like a mother’s desire who wants to give a bath to the child

428
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,240
and get him cleansed somehow, you see.

429
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,480
So whichever way you like – whether you like a chocolate

430
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,600
or whether you like a little rebuking

431
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,040
or whatever way you like, I am willing to work it out,

432
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,120
but please at least desire that you have to have

433
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,600
your Self-realization.

434
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,320
May God bless you all.

435
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,720
I hope those who get realization

436
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,000
will settle down with it seriously,

437
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,640
understand it is your responsibility today

438
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,520
that you are born today here in this country,

439
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,120
which is a special thing for Me and for Sahaja Yoga,

440
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,760
and that you should get your Self-realization,

441
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,800
understand it very well and digest it and go into it

442
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,640
and become a very, very powerful personality that you have to be.

443
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,080
But even a small thing like that, they said,

444
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,160
‘You take out your shoes.’ Because, you see,

445
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,800
shoes make you little bit tightened up.

446
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,040
Even that much if you ask them, oh, they,

447
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,000
as if I’ve asked a hundred pounds from them!

448
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,080
Even that little thing they don’t want to do

449
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,200
and why are they here, I don’t understand,

450
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,560
all the way they come for what?

451
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,720
You don’t want to get your realization?

452
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:43,320
You don’t want to get the greatest blessing of the Divine?

453
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,040
Then what am I to do? How am I to deal with you?

454
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,120
You may be very well educated person, all right, a learned man,

455
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,520
but you have not known so far.

456
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,080
It happens with gurus, it happens with everyone,

457
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,000
they are sticking on to a guru;

458
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,320
they are sticking on to a guru

459
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,400
they cannot give up that guru, whatever it is,

460
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,800
is another kind of a ego because they think of,

461
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,080
‘All right, we have eaten the crow; so what

462
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,360
if we have eaten the crow, we have eaten the crow!

463
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,680
So, go ahead with it.’ This is another category of people

464
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,640
who don’t want to give up whatever is nonsensical.

465
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,360
Then the third category is another one who are just waiting,

466
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,200
‘All right, let the catastrophe come.

467
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,880
We are just waiting.’ I mean, they told Me,

468
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,720
‘Mother, doesn’t matter, don’t You worry,

469
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,120
we are all waiting for the catastrophe,

470
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,880
disaster.When is it going to arrive? You just tell us that.

471
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,400
We are all anxiously waiting.

472
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,240
If it is coming, it’s a very good thing,

473
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,920
now we are reconciled to a situation like that.’

474
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,040
On the streets of Paris, if you go there,

475
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,840
you find many like that, discussing,

476
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,160
when are the ten stars going to meet

477
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,680
so that we are all collided and made into a jam.

478
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,160
We won’t be made into a jam, I must tell you,

479
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,480
but something horrible which is thousand times worse

480
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:09,160
than what you are doing on the streets of Paris.

481
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:17,160
But this kind of attitude of three types of people,

482
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,680
I don’t know, I may, I’m thinking, now I have been in London

483
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,120
for so many days and My going time is coming

484
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,120
and I don’t know what’s going to happen now,

485
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,920
because Sahaja Yogis themselves are desperate

486
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,280
and they all want to settle down in India.

487
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,880
I will not allow them to settle down in India unless and until

488
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,400
they at least get half of the English people realized.

489
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,000
Yes, that’s for very sure.

490
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,000
If you think that now Mother has gone there,

491
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,120
so let us take our baggage there and let settle down

492
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,200
in a nice little ashram enjoying yourself, nothing doing!

493
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,680
You have to work hard.

494
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,040
You have to get at least half of the British people realized

495
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,120
somehow; if you can’t do it, you’re not allowed

496
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:10,080
to enjoy any rest and I, too, will not be able to have any rest

497
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,800
in My lifetime, if these things do not happen.

498
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,920
I hope you all understand My concern,

499
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:24,840
My great concern and My love for British people here

500
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,360
who must understand also their place

501
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,600
in this great work of God, how they should come up.

502
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,920
May God bless you all.

503
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,600
I'll have some water to drink.

504
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,040
I think I'll be better off here.

505
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,840
Better sit.

506
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm very much better here.

507
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,600
Any questions? Please!

508
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,680
So, you are here? So nice to see you!

509
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,360
What's happening in the Isle of Wight?

510
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,160
Are you there?

511
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,440
Me?

512
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,720
I don’t live in Isle of Wight. I'm from Hampstead.

513
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,520
We have some people there? I don't know.

514
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,360
We have to try all kinds of things.

515
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,040
Now, what's the question is?

516
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,720
I can't read your minds. Please tell me.

517
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,000
It's all right. They are all right there.

518
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,080
What's the question?

519
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,000
No questions?

520
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,760
There could be a question:

521
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,600
"How to have the desire?"

522
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,080
Isn't it? If somebody asked me a question like that,

523
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,000
"How to have the desire, Mother, tell us?", you see, it would be,

524
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,680
"How to have the desire to eat the icecream?", you see?

525
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,880
Sometimes you don't know whether to cry or to laugh.

526
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,920
It's like that.

527
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,840
How many people have come for the first time? Please raise your hands.

528
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,920
Lots of them. Good, good, good...

529
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,000
I would say, those who have come the first time should come forward

530
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,600
and sahaja yogis should go back.

531
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,680
Mohan, you can go back.

532
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,160
Who else is there? Haan, you go back.

533
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,000
Yes, come along. Sit down, sit down, sit down.

534
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,320
Here.

535
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,160
First or second row, please be seated.

536
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,600
Will you be comfortable? Sure?

537
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
Yes, yes...

538
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,440
Will you be comfortable there, down below?

539
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,480
No, you can sit in the second row, if you want

540
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,120
and if you are not comfortable, it is not easy to sit on the ground.

541
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,560
Why don't you put the chairs around, like that?

542
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,320
So they'll get you some chairs there and some chairs here

543
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,720
Can you bring here some chairs, in the first line?

544
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,240
Just put it there, now.

545
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,880
You can bring it...

546
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,160
[MOTHER SPEAKS HINDI]

547
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,360
They are stuck together Mother.

548
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,160
What's about - they are fixed?

549
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,720
- Yes.
- What?

550
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Fixed, hai?

551
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,120
I'm sorry for that.

552
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,400
The whole thing, you can bring it, yes, yes.

553
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,640
Better sit there, you have to be comfortable, my child.

554
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,320
Better be there. You will be comfortable.

555
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,640
You have to be comfortable, that's first thing.

556
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,560
Right? Wherever you are comfortable, please be seated.

557
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,720
It’s good to see so many new people.

558
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,920
It's such a great thing.

559
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,280
That's all, that's all, they don't want...

560
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,560
They, they are... They say they are happy here.

561
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,560
Now...

562
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,240
Is a very simple thing

563
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,320
that Kundalini is to be awakened within you

564
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,520
because she's there,

565
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,360
she has been there

566
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,640
and she gets awakened by itself,

567
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,480
spontanous, don't have to do anything. It's all yours.

568
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,080
Only thing, as Gavin must have told you that

569
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,600
an enlightened light can enlighten another light.

570
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,200
In the same way,

571
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,040
if I am an enlightened person, you should get your enlightenment.

572
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,320
And it works in no time, should work in no time.

573
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,760
If you can put your hands just like this,

574
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,040
now, I must give you explanation,

575
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,040
I'm not going to take anything from you.

576
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,680
It's just because these fingers denote your centers.

577
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,320
These are five fingers, six and seven are the left side

578
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,160
centers, these are right side centers.

579
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,040
When they are crossed together, you form the central path

580
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,440
which is the one we call as the Sushumna.

581
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,000
Now the central path manifests what we call in

582
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,240
the medical terminology as parasympathetic nervous system.

583
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:05,040
Now, this central path is - has got one left and one right

584
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,720
in - on one center.

585
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,320
So, what we do is to put our hands like this

586
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,080
so that these ends, which are receptive,

587
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,840
are the ends of the sympathetic nervous system,

588
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,640
so the left and the right sympathetic system gets enlightened

589
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,920
which is fixed here, like this, you see?

590
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,360
So what we do is to just put your hands like this,

591
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,120
towards Me,

592
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,760
without putting any pressure or anything,

593
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,400
on your lap. Be comfortable.

594
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,880
Be comfortable.

595
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,040
Now, you may have to loosen little bit if there is something tight

596
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,640
or making you uncomfortable, that's all.

597
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,560
And the feet,

598
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,440
is better if you are sitting on the ground is all right or any way,

599
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,200
but if they are on the Mother Earth, it helps.

600
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,840
But if you like it, like you are sitting, is all right,

601
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,360
doesn't matter. Put your hands straight like this.

602
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,600
Makes no difference whatever way you have been putting your hands,

603
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,200
just the fingers should come towards Me, that's all.

604
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,120
Facing towards Me.

605
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,440
Now, it doesn't matter from what race, creed,

606
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,840
coulor, whatever way you are coming here.

607
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,320
And also doesn't matter whatever you have done before.

608
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,480
Now, we are here at this present moment.

609
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,400
This moment is important for Me.

610
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,600
At this moment, you are here

611
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:38,320
to jump into the new awareness of Self-realization.

612
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,480
So, this is the most important time -

613
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,560
for Me and for you.

614
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,000
At this time, forget about the past and the future.

615
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,800
Say, somebody thinks that he is guilty

616
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,800
of something, I mean that's a fashion these days,

617
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,320
to feel guilty is a fashion.

618
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,840
In the West it's a fashion.

619
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,520
Just for nothing, why to feel guilty, I can't understand.

620
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,680
An Indian will never feel guilty, you know, whatever they may do.

621
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,800
And this fashion of feeling guilty

622
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
really clutches Me from here to here sometimes

623
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,720
when I am talking to the Western people.

624
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,520
At the first outset

625
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,560
you must know that you are not guilty at all in the presence of God.

626
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,880
In the eyes of God you are not guilty

627
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,760
and you have no business to condemn yourself,

628
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,680
because you are going to be the temple of God.

629
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,440
And now don't feel guilty about yourself.

630
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:36,400
You have not even made your nose, what are you feeling guilty about?

631
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,560
So just have a very cheerful disposition about yourself,

632
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,760
that you are not guilty,

633
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,840
that you are going to be the spirit,

634
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,680
the beauty, the glory that you are.

635
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,280
And there is no need to feel guilty at all!

636
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,800
Is very important. At the very outset,

637
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,440
I will request you not to feel guilty.

638
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,160
That's first thing you have to do.

639
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,880
Sincerely

640
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,440
you have to say to yourself, "I'm not guilty at all".

641
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,160
Because there's a big block here sitting, just now,

642
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,320
into everybody's left side.

643
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,320
And that's how they get spondylitis

644
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,880
so much so that I may get one day spondylitis,

645
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,480
the way people are getting it.

646
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,440
So we are not to feel guilty at all, we have to decide on that point.

647
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,160
Whatever people might have told you,

648
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,520
that we are the greatest sinners or whatever it is,

649
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,320
in the presence of God's love

650
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,000
we cannot feel guilty, because we challenge His powers

651
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,680
of forgiveness.

652
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,720
He has a power to forgive,

653
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,360
and He forgives such big sins that what sins can we commit, isn't it?

654
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,040
So just don't feel guilty,

655
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,400
that is the first thing I have explained to you.

656
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,360
By reading all these horrible books

657
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,760
I think people also start feeling guilty.

658
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,800
I don't know how, what are the... what are the sources are,

659
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,280
but is a very common practice,

660
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,080
I don't know where they sell this business of guilt

661
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,640
but definitely people are feeling guilty for nothing at all.

662
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,080
So I would request you not to feel guilty,

663
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,200
put your hands towards Me and just close your eyes.

664
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,400
Just close your eyes.

665
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,200
Now, how do I manage it?

666
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,920
I must tell you now.

667
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,880
Is very simple for Me.

668
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,120
What I do, that, with My attention,

669
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,160
I put you, all of you, in My heart.

670
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,840
I can do it.

671
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,720
Supposing you know how to put someone in your heart,

672
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,200
you can also do it very easy.

673
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,120
You are all in My heart.

674
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,800
Supposing I conceive you in My heart, you can say like that,

675
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,600
and raise My Kundalini,

676
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,680
and bring it to the fontanelle bone area

677
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,800
where resides the seat of My spirit

678
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,560
and then touches,

679
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,480
My own Kundalini

680
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,200
touches

681
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,560
the spirit, the seat of the spirit,

682
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,160
and when it happens,

683
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:17,760
then you all feel that you have got your realization.

684
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,000
You feel the realization.

685
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,200
This is how it happens.

686
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,320
But when you people get your realization,

687
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,640
you also get the same powers.

688
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,800
And you can give realization to others

689
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,120
just by raising your hands behind the back of the people

690
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,040
whom you want to give realization.

691
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,560
It is a very simple method worked out very simply,

692
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,000
by nature, by the living process of evolution.

693
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,200
Now close your eyes properly,

694
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,280
put your hands towards Me.

695
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,560
As a result of this,

696
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,240
first thing, you start noticing in your thoughts,

697
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,880
ask your mind, "What are you thinking?"

698
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,520
Keep your eyes shut, fully,

699
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,160
that's important.

700
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,720
You'll find that there is no answer.

701
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,120
In many of you, you'll find that the answers are running away.

702
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,800
When you are trying to catch

703
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,880
the answer, there is no answer, is all running away.

704
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,000
That's the best situation.

705
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,680
When the mind is resting for the change, you see, it's not thinking.

706
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:56,560
When this has happened within you, then we have to start

707
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,280
acting on our desire.

708
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,560
So the left hand represents the desire that we have,

709
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,920
so keep the left hand fixed towards Me

710
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,200
and with the right hand now you have to act.

711
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,440
Don't open your eyes at any cost,

712
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,360
please don't open your eyes at any cost.

713
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,440
Put your right hand on your heart.

714
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,760
If you're wearing a coat, put your hand inside the coat.

715
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,920
Put it on your heart on the left-hand side.

716
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,480
Put the left hand straight towards Me.

717
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,760
Stretched out, now.

718
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:38,680
Now you have to ask a question to yourself in your heart,

719
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,720
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

720
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,280
Ask the question. Which you are!

721
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,120
But you better ask the question in the beginning because the

722
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,160
attitude just now is:

723
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,000
Whether I am the spirit or not,

724
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,560
even if the Mother says, you need not believe it.

725
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,680
So just say, "Mother, am I the spirit?"

726
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,800
Keep your eyes shut fully.

727
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,280
Ask sincerely.

728
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,920
Now, if you are the spirit,

729
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,240
then you have to be your master also.

730
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,640
Now you can put the same hand

731
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:30,440
down below on another center on the left-hand side on the stomach.

732
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,920
On the stomach on the left-hand side quite lower,

733
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,920
and ask a question in the center on the left-hand side,

734
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,240
in the central part of the stomach,

735
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,400
and ask a question,

736
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,440
"Mother, am I my own master?"

737
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,120
"Am I my own guru?"

738
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,720
Ask this question at least ten times.

739
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,240
Sincerely, from your heart, with confidence,

740
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:48,400
ask the question, "Mother, am I my own master?"

741
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,040
Now, put the right hand again on your heart.

742
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,760
Now, at this point,

743
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,760
you have to confidently say

744
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,520
that "Mother, I am the spirit."

745
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,120
You have to confidently say that "Mother, I am the spirit."

746
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,600
Say it twelve times please.

747
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,120
"Mother, I am the spirit!" You are the spirit.

748
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,920
Everyone has said that you are the spirit.

749
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,320
And you are to be born

750
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,760
again.

751
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,280
Just assert.

752
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,760
Now raise your right hand higher

753
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,640
onto the base of your neck, the left side.

754
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,640
Again, we are working on the left because of the desire.

755
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,360
Base of the neck on the left-hand side,

756
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:31,240
where I told you is a big block of guilt.

757
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,880
Now if you are the spirit, how can you be guilty?

758
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,040
Because the spirit never commits sins,

759
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,720
is guiltless,

760
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,920
is perfect,

761
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,280
is absolute.

762
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,280
So now you say "Mother,"

763
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,080
"I'm not guilty"

764
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,400
with full confidence and sixteen times,

765
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,080
and if you have been too much guilty, say it thirty-two times.

766
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,920
That's...

767
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,280
That's a better punishment.

768
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,720
'Cause I am suffering because of your guilt.

769
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,840
For anything, even for smoking or drinking or anything,

770
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,880
don't feel guilty. Forget it.

771
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,840
Serious or trivial things, don't feel guilty.

772
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,920
You have to respect yourself, isn't it?

773
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,560
If you are the spirit.

774
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,840
Now.

775
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,000
Better now.

776
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,760
Because you really don't know what you are,

777
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,640
that's why you are feeling guil... guilty, I really tell you.

778
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,920
When you will know what you are,

779
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,280
you'll be enamored

780
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,280
to know.

781
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,560
Please believe Me.

782
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,400
Don't condemn yourself at all.

783
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,280
No confessions.

784
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,560
And no past to be brought in just now. Please forget the past.

785
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,080
Don't try to count all of them one by one.

786
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,400
At this time it's very important.

787
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,520
I know what you are doing, some of you.

788
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,720
Forget it.

789
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,680
Just forget it.

790
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,240
Whatever others might have said

791
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,080
just forget it, for heaven's sake!

792
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,040
Now raise this right hand over your forehead.

793
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,640
Just.

794
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,040
This is the crown of your head

795
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:07,560
where we have not been able to forgive others.

796
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,640
The one who wears the crown has to forgive others.

797
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,600
So what we have to say that "Mother,

798
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,920
I forgive everyone."

799
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,560
Is the simplest thing to do

800
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,800
because those who say it is difficult, they don't know it's a myth.

801
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,040
When you forgive your - others, what are you doing? Nothing.

802
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,320
And when you don't forgive,what do you do? Nothing.

803
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,880
Only thing when you don't forgive, then only you torture yourself

804
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,880
and play into the hands of people who wanted to trouble you.

805
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,920
So just say with full heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

806
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,240
Now, you can put your hand on your head.

807
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:02,720
On your head in the center where you had a

808
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,440
fontanelle bone area being soft in your childhood,

809
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,680
and press it with your palm,

810
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,080
you yourself, you are taking your own realization,

811
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,440
so press it with your palm,

812
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,240
in a clockwise manner,

813
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,800
clockwise manner. Put your full palm on your head,

814
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,240
in front, a little, it's in the front side,

815
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,320
and press it and move it, your palm, move it like that, yes, palm.

816
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,760
Move it. Press it hard.

817
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,320
At this point, we have to say

818
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,320
that, "Mother, I want my realization."

819
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,760
Because as I told you, I cannot cross your freedom.

820
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,400
So you have to say: "Mother, please give me realization."

821
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,200
Otherwise I cannot do it, I'm sorry.

822
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:56,080
That's the trouble with Me, is that I can't do it on My own.

823
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,120
So I'm requesting you to say

824
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,760
"Mother, I want my realization."

825
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,280
It's all right, you've got it.

826
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,000
Now raise your hand,

827
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,680
about four inches, and see if there's a cool breeze coming out.

828
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,040
You have to see for yourself.

829
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,080
There? It's there.

830
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,280
All right, now change over, you can change over and see.

831
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,000
Don't open your eyes, just change over and see.

832
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,920
Put your right hand towards Me.

833
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,560
Right hand like this

834
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,080
and now put the left hand

835
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,720
and see if there's a cool breeze coming out

836
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,480
See on your head,

837
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,720
from your head, if there is a cool breeze coming out.

838
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,720
Now don't think about it.

839
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,720
You can't think, by thinking it has not... There?

840
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,080
It is very subtle.

841
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,040
Started in the hands. Stop to the head.

842
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,520
Is working out,

843
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,800
working out, woeking out.

844
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,440
Change your hands again, whenever you want to.

845
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,040
Change your hand. See for yourself,

846
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,360
and don't you worry even if you don't feel it,

847
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,880
we have so many people here who can again enforce it.

848
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,680
Don't become serious, is going to be there. You just don't worry.

849
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,840
None of you are missing your Kundalini.

850
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,440
I can assure you, it's all there.

851
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,040
May take a little more time for some people,

852
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,000
less time for some people, makes no difference.

853
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,760
Don't condemn yourself

854
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,040
and don't be serious.

855
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,000
Put your hand a little lower and move it up and down.

856
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,640
Some people might be feeling in the hand.

857
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,600
Some people will feel it in the hand,

858
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,440
the hand that is towards Me.

859
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,240
On here, ask them to see here.

860
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,400
Now the Sahaja Yogis can see, but need not talk or touch,

861
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,360
just see if they,

862
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,000
you are feeling it.

863
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,920
She's got it.

864
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,920
It's very subtle.

865
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,720
Got it?

866
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,200
What about him? Mohan, just see,

867
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,480
the gentleman next to you.

868
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,040
He’s a realized soul.

869
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,280
He's already there.

870
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,600
Then

871
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:56,520
see this gentleman touched it and again he is thinking about it.

872
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,880
Now don't think about it,

873
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,560
please don't think about it.

874
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,800
There are wonderful people here in Holborn, I must say.

875
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,720
It's a wonderful place to come to.

876
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,680
