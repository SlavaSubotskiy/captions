1
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:35,999
Now the essence of Sahaja Yoga,

2
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:41,333
I am sure Mr.Govindram must have explained to you what it is.

3
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:48,000
And so many of you are from Sahaja Yoga itself.

4
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:53,999
So I need not explain to you all the details.

5
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:59,667
But today we have to understand one thing

6
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:04,583
that it’s a very serious time we are born into, extremely serious.

7
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:08,333
And when we look at life

8
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:14,333
we do not understand that

9
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:19,166
if we miss this chance of our evolution,

10
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:23,583
not only that we’ll miss it for ourselves,

11
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,125
not only that we’ll miss it for England,

12
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,583
or only for one country,

13
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:33,709
but we’ll miss it for the whole creation.

14
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:39,583
The trouble is, in the name of God,

15
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:43,834
in the name of evolution,

16
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,875
in the name of higher life,

17
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:54,375
so many spurious people have come up

18
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:59,291
that it has become impossible to convince anyone

19
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,208
that there is something like truth left in it.

20
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:06,375
Under these circumstances,

21
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,166
one has to talk about truth

22
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,542
and talking about truth

23
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,166
doesn’t give you the experience of the truth at all.

24
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,125
Discussing about it will not give you,

25
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:22,333
it’s a different realm in which one has to go into,

26
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,333
it’s a new awareness which you have to get,

27
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:27,375
to understand the truth,

28
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:31,709
for which I don’t know how many are prepared,

29
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:34,542
and how many would like to know,

30
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,083
and even if they like to know, how many will get it.

31
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,166
So the problem is the other way round.

32
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:46,125
It’s not the problem that you have few people,

33
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,709
it’s not the problem

34
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:52,500
that Sahaja Yoga cannot give you realization,

35
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:58,208
it’s not the problem that you will not know the truth,

36
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:01,959
but the whole circumstance is such,

37
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:06,458
that whatever is false, whatever is spurious,

38
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:12,083
whatever is silly, stupid, appeals to the masses.

39
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,959
Sometimes I feel I have developed a method

40
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,166
by which I can give really en masse realization

41
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,625
all over the world,

42
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,667
definitely I have.

43
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,917
But the problem as it remains,

44
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,125
the masses are not interested.

45
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:30,667
It’s only very few who really can keenly take interest

46
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,291
into their evolutionary process

47
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,792
and would like to come out of the ignorance

48
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,667
in which they have been living.

49
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,458
In all the ego-oriented countries

50
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:45,458
it’s very difficult to establish

51
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:49,500
that we are still ignorant,

52
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,875
we have to know a lot. It’s very difficult.

53
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,709
Because they think we know everything,

54
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:58,625
because we have been to the moon. Like the Russians say,

55
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:03,458
‘We never saw God, we went to the moon, we never saw God.’

56
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,999
It would be like saying that I have come

57
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,792
to the third floor, I haven’t seen God.

58
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:14,041
Where does God reside? Where it manifest within us?

59
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,959
In what way it manifest, we don’t want to see.

60
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,083
What we want to see is that through our effort,

61
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:25,959
if we have not been able to see God, then He doesn’t exist.

62
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,709
This is the way our attitude is.

63
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:33,999
But better say, 'No,' to all that we did not know

64
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,291
through our effort,

65
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,999
because so far we have not known about Him.

66
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,667
So He doesn’t exist.

67
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,542
So you turn round in a cave

68
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,542
when you see the shadows of yourself,

69
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,959
you believe in them only and say,

70
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,834
‘It never existed anything else, the light does not exist.’

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,458
That kind of an attitude exists

72
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:05,667
or is persistently I am facing.

73
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:14,375
And sometimes, I don’t know how to give them realization.

74
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:18,000
Now as I said, it’s the other way round.

75
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:21,291
You have to seek. You have to ask for it.

76
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,709
You have to truly ask for it.

77
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,999
Nobody is going to fall at your feet and say,

78
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,166
‘All right, you get your realization.

79
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,999
All right, you have this for heaven’s sake!'

80
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,667
Just have it!

81
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,792
Because nothing is selling here.

82
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:40,291
You are so much used to the salesmanship, you see,

83
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,875
that we think that if anything is selling,

84
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:48,917
people have to persuade you, to request you, ask you,

85
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:52,208
you can save pounds, you see, for sale and all that.

86
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:56,208
But nothing is for sale.

87
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,709
That’s a very difficult proposition to understand

88
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:08,291
in the present atmosphere,

89
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,542
where we do not know if you can get anything that is not for sale.

90
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:21,875
But, I hope slowly and steadily,

91
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:28,417
all of us have to get it.

92
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:32,792
Somehow, one has to work very hard. Sometimes it’s very frustrating

93
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:37,166
and it’s so stupid, the way people react,

94
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,875
that I just don’t know what to say.

95
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,959
Like the other day we had a meeting in Brighton.

96
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,999
I was laughing all the time. But so saddening.

97
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,083
A gentleman came to our program

98
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,625
and he complained, he thought, he said,

99
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,458
‘I was videoed.’

100
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:57,375
See, who has got time here to put him for a video,

101
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,250
who is interested in taking his photographs? I mean,

102
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,291
he says, ‘I am a managing director.’ So what?

103
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,875
In the presence of Divine, what is a managing director,

104
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,709
what is a king, what is it? Just think of it. Who is he?

105
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:14,834
What does he think of himself and he has complained against us.

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,500
I hope he doesn’t go to police for that.

107
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:21,750
Even the laws are so stupid sometimes, I can’t understand,

108
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:27,999
how has he got any right to complain if you come to a program

109
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,959
which is being conducted with a video on Me

110
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:37,125
and if you are photographed, how can you complain?

111
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:46,500
One thing I feel that on one side is such stupid,

112
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:54,667
useless people, the other side are such great seekers.

113
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,999
And how to reach them?

114
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:02,750
Like a diamond covered with lot of mud.

115
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,917
So much mud. It’s all mud.

116
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:11,291
In that to find out those diamonds,

117
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,999
to dive into this mire of ignorance,

118
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:20,041
to get out these diamonds which are lost.

119
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,250
It’s such a concern, that I feel sometimes

120
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:29,583
that this mud is going to cover their brains, their ego,

121
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:33,750
everything, and they may not receive their realization.

122
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:37,333
They may miss this point.

123
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:41,667
Actually, Divine does not know what human beings have created.

124
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,291
Really, I tell you,

125
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,667
Divine has no ideas what nonsense you have created around.

126
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,375
All kinds of nonsense you have created

127
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,709
out of your ignorance, out of your ego,

128
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:58,625
out of your choice that you had.

129
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:04,417
I can’t explain why people have created this kind of ignorance

130
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:10,667
which cannot be broken, cannot be removed.

131
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,250
Because they are so much identified.

132
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:19,667
It’s like a stuck-up stamp which cannot come out of people.

133
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:23,792
And when such a thing happens

134
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,792
you feel, Oh, God!`'

135
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:32,291
The whole creation has been created,

136
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,083
whole working has taken place,

137
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:41,041
the human beings have grown so well,

138
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,999
out of a amoeba they have been brought to this stage.

139
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:50,291
Now in these modern times you find the human beings so stupid,

140
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,291
so foolish,

141
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,333
and deluding others with their stupidity and foolishness.

142
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:04,333
How are we to approach the people who are true seekers,

143
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:07,458
have been seekers for ages,

144
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:12,500
those who have sought for years together,

145
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:17,667
all their lives before, who are lost?

146
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:22,750
Sometimes it is very, very disappointing.

147
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:27,458
But still, hoping against hopes,

148
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:31,125
I hope we reach all the corners

149
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:35,250
of this universe where we find

150
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:40,709
all the people who are true seekers.

151
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:43,041
It is their right to know,

152
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,542
it is their power to know the Divine.

153
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,667
It’s not for everybody because he’s somebody is a managing director

154
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,709
or a king or anything. What does it matter?

155
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:58,583
In the presence of God, they’ll be pushed out.

156
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:02,208
They will not be allowed to enter into the kingdom of God.

157
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:05,041
Who will be allowed to enter into the kingdom of God?

158
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,959
Those who have known.

159
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,959
Also, not those who just talk about God.

160
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,917
Those who say that

161
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,583
‘We are the worshippers of God, we have learned so much’.

162
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:22,166
They will say, “All right, go with your books

163
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,166
to the places from where you have come.’

164
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,999
What have you to know is through your awareness,

165
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,750
in your awareness you have to know.

166
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,792
The awareness has to be enlightened.

167
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:35,667
It is not, what you know it is human awareness,

168
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:40,250
which is still at a point, I say, has to grow so much.

169
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,333
First it has to be awakened

170
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:44,917
and then it has to grow in its light.

171
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,542
It’s such a lot of journey we have to do

172
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,959
even after realization.

173
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:56,417
It takes no time sometimes to give realization to many people.

174
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,250
I know it has happened with so many.

175
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,667
But they don’t know what they have to achieve.

176
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,250
It’s such a horrible stuff is this ego is,

177
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:08,041
that people don’t want to see what they haven’t got with them,

178
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,999
and what they have to hide, have and what they, they deserve.

179
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:17,417
They are so identified with ego and satisfied with it,

180
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,500
that they don’t want to see that beauty that lies within them,

181
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:26,792
the spirit, the reflection of God’s Love

182
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:33,458
which is like the highest and the most precious thing

183
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:36,999
that you could think of.

184
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:41,583
In this England,

185
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:46,125
I don’t know how many lectures I have given

186
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:50,417
and how much I have worked hard.

187
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:55,083
Of course there are results, no doubt. But it is so slow.

188
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,750
Compared to the fake,

189
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,375
compared to the artificial people,

190
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,333
compared to the people who have made money out of you,

191
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,375
those who have exploited you,

192
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,083
have ruined you,

193
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:12,959
Sahaja Yoga is working so very slowly.

194
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,875
I would not have been so much disappointed

195
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,917
if it was at the time of Christ

196
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:23,542
because at that time there were very few seekers.

197
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:30,959
Actually even the fishermen who Christ collected, were not seekers.

198
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,458
You are seekers of the truth.

199
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,999
And so many of you have taken birth

200
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,125
just to seek the truth.

201
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:42,375
And where are we going? What are we doing about it?

202
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:46,333
What are our ideas about the truth?

203
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:53,875
Can we have our own

204
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,999
ideas, conception about the truth?

205
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:03,792
Is it not that our ego itself has given us lots of ideas?

206
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:07,417
Is it not that we do not want to see the truth?

207
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,792
I meet all kinds of people in this country.

208
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:14,458
I must say they are very highly placed, very great,

209
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:17,583
somebody is a lord and somebody is a lady

210
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:22,125
and somebody is another huge personality, and this and that.

211
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,458
But, they said, ‘ Who wants to change? ’

212
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:28,458
I said, “Really. That’s true.”

213
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:32,166
Because they think they are the greatest people ever born

214
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:36,333
and they’re going to take all their lordship with them to the heaven.

215
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,041
They said, ‘Who wants to change? ’

216
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:44,792
I said then, "Such a lot can be said on the point,

217
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:46,999
but if you don’t want to change,

218
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,375
that’s a full stop, complete full stop."

219
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,542
You cannot talk to them.

220
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,792
Now this, I must say is -

221
00:14:56,291 --> 00:15:04,166
only can work out with people who are seekers,

222
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:11,750
who want to know, through their awareness, what is the truth.

223
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,625
You have to know your spirit.

224
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:19,709
Without knowing your spirit, you cannot know what is the truth.

225
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:24,583
Whatever I may talk to you is a waste, complete waste

226
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:29,250
because you haven’t got that awareness today,

227
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,041
to know what I am talking about.

228
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:37,125
So, first thing is: I request you to become the spirit.

229
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,250
Is simple thing as that.

230
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:46,750
Like now I have to see into your skin for example,

231
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,291
I’ll have to use a microscope.

232
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,792
And then people will say, ‘All right,you see through the microscope

233
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:57,417
you cannot see with your naked eyes.’

234
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,792
All right? Supposing I want to listen to somebody’s heart,

235
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:03,291
then people will say, ‘Use a stethoscope,

236
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,917
otherwise you cannot listen to somebody’s heart.’

237
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,583
All right. You don’t question that time do you,

238
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,625
you just put it there and try to listen.

239
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:17,583
In the same way, why not we do about the spirit,

240
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:22,667
why not we do what it is told to you,

241
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:26,792
that you have to get your realization,

242
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,875
that you have to become the spirit first,

243
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,417
that unless and until this awareness is enlightened

244
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,959
by the spirit, you cannot see.

245
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:41,208
Is like telling something about the coulors to a blind,

246
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,333
you have to open your eyes,

247
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:50,041
but this simple thing also people don’t accept.

248
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,125
The reason is people are very naive.

249
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:57,041
They don’t know, what is it,

250
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,999
and also they don’t want to understand.

251
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,792
Now as you see a tree standing there

252
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:08,041
and so many trees are there,

253
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:13,041
you must also know, that there are roots to it.

254
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,500
But somebody has told you there are roots.

255
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:22,250
You may not believe into it, but why not see, is the point.

256
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,083
Why not see if there are roots or not?

257
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:29,125
Supposing I say, “ Whatever you are outside,

258
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,875
you are much more inside.”

259
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,959
So why not we see it?

260
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,333
This is a simple question we should ask ourselves,

261
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:41,291
‘Why should I put any barrier to that seeing,

262
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:47,125
if that is going to give me all the best in this world?

263
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,709
If it is going to give me

264
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:52,750
even the inkling

265
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:55,375
of that beautiful thing called spirit,

266
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,375
why not have it?’

267
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:01,333
You don’t have to pay for it, you don’t have to exert for it,

268
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:05,125
you don’t have to do anything, but you have to desire.

269
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,041
This is the point I am trying to make,

270
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,166
that if you do not desire from your heart,

271
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,458
then God is not going to fall at your feet,

272
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:16,750
now please desire for Me, is He?

273
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,458
It’s a simple thing like that

274
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,999
and if you people understand

275
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,709
that you have to really desire it,

276
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:27,667
because it’s such a vicious circle I must tell you,

277
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,333
that this kundalini - is not here the picture -

278
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:38,500
the kundalini is the pure desire within you.

279
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:42,959
Is the desire which is not yet manifested,

280
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:47,083
it is not yet awakened in the sense that it is acting,

281
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,500
but it has not acted.

282
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,542
So, if so, how much important it is

283
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,125
that you should have the desire

284
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:02,333
to be one with the Divine, to be in Yoga,

285
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,792
to be one with your spirit.

286
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:07,208
The desire has to be strong,

287
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:09,458
if it is not a strong desire

288
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:13,667
you are challenging your own kundalini, you are anti-kundalini

289
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,125
and then the kundalini won’t rise.

290
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:20,000
But what is this brain has achieved so far, just look at it.

291
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,959
You must understand, what have we achieved by this brain?

292
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,500
For example, this stupid managing director whosoever came there,

293
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:30,333
just ask him what good has he done to anyone?

294
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:33,250
What does he know about spiritual life?

295
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,959
What does he understand about Christ’s life?’

296
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,750
But if he sends a letter,

297
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:40,875
the newspaper is very willing to write it down.

298
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,999
I mean look at the stupidity of the whole stuff.

299
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:49,583
Without understanding that anything that has to go to the masses

300
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:54,375
should be something sensible, from a sensible man,

301
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,999
who is supposed to be an authority

302
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,583
on spiritual life that he is talking about.

303
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:03,208
What good this fellow has done, nobody reads that.

304
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:07,333
But if I write something or any Sahaja Yogi says that, "see

305
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:10,709
by coming to Sahaja Yoga we dropped down all our bad habits,

306
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,792
I got cured of my cancer" or anything

307
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:15,458
nobody wants to listen to you. They think you are mad.

308
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:19,583
But a man like that, if he writes, then they publish it.

309
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:21,959
So it shows very clearly

310
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,250
that you see we are living with people

311
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:30,125
who are really not only mad but are absolutely foolish people,

312
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:34,375
who have no sense at all as to how they have to live

313
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,500
and how they have to move.

314
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:43,625
This is what we have come to know about so many people now,

315
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:48,417
that sometimes you people have to take upon yourself

316
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:52,959
to go into it and find out what is the truth.

317
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,250
It is you who have to find it out.

318
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,625
You see, it would be something like that, I say now,

319
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:01,542
`This is a place where there are lots of diamonds',

320
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,625
say, I say that. Or:`This is a cave in which,

321
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:08,999
if you move there is a lot of, say - gold.'

322
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:13,208
Now the gold is not going to come out from there, is it?

323
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:14,792
Simple as that.

324
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:18,417
You have to go towards the gold to find it out or not.

325
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,125
You have to go towards it,

326
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,417
but here I’m not saying that you walk towards anything

327
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:27,500
or do anything like that, just you have to desire,

328
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:31,041
and desire it from your heart.

329
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,959
Is impossible for me to work out kundalini

330
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,041
if you do not desire, because the desire,

331
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,917
the pure desire, is the kundalini.

332
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:44,208
You understand My problem is now. Pure desire is the kundalini

333
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:47,166
and if you are against your pure desire,

334
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,208
what can I do about it? Can I force it?

335
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:53,750
You cannot push it out, you see? Like a seed,

336
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:57,250
if you have to, if you want to have a seed sprouted,

337
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,291
you have to put it in the Mother Earth,

338
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,792
but you cannot take it out

339
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:04,917
the bits of the seed and sprout it, can you?

340
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,999
It’s a living process and for this living process

341
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:12,041
you have to have a pure desire.

342
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,625
And if that desire is not there,

343
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,542
I am breaking My head against stones, I feel.

344
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,291
So it is important that you understand

345
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,709
that you must have that desire which is the highest.

346
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:27,917
But if you are satisfied with things

347
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,208
which are useless and nonsensical,

348
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,250
then what am I to do with that?

349
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,458
Now you just tell Me with someone

350
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:38,291
who is interested in things which are nonsensical,

351
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,208
now how do you bring them round?

352
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:43,417
I mean, there is no psychology that can bring them round,

353
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:47,542
you see, because you have to have the desire to be all right.

354
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,500
But this is something so innate,

355
00:22:50,709 --> 00:22:55,333
being the process itself is a living process

356
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,999
and doesn’t work out

357
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,375
if the people do not have the pure desire.

358
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:02,083
Now this written down since long.

359
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:05,625
It cannot be changed, it cannot be forced,

360
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:10,333
it cannot be sort of explained or discussed,

361
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:14,333
or argued, nothing can be done; it has to work out within you.

362
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:17,458
Now even when you have worked it out on someone,

363
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:20,917
you may not achieve the results. That’s possible.

364
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,250
You may, you may not.

365
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,625
So, when the situation is so difficult

366
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:29,667
and where the children are also so adamant,

367
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,375
then what can Mother do?

368
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,208
Is to push them in.

369
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:36,250
See, I am very much concerned,

370
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:40,625
that this ego which is sometimes so selfish

371
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:42,500
and so conceited,

372
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:46,250
that it satisfies itself and it’s very happy,

373
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,291
it will not allow you to get to the, that point

374
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,083
where you really stand, where you have all your powers,

375
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:57,166
where you are the master of your being. It will not allow.

376
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:00,417
The identification with the ego is so much,

377
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:04,417
that’s easy to take a bull by the horn

378
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:08,083
but to take an ego-oriented man through Sahaja Yoga’s practices

379
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,917
is very difficult.

380
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:19,166
I am rather today in a mood of,

381
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:23,792
I should say little disgust, I should say,

382
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:27,000
but also the other mood comes on me

383
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:32,875
of complete compassion and tremendous love.

384
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:37,834
That somehow I should do something to bring

385
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,125
sense into the heads of these people.

386
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:44,625
Something should happen to them

387
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:48,709
because otherwise what I see is a complete disaster.

388
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:51,458
It’s going to come, believe Me, it’s going to come.

389
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:56,125
I don’t want to frighten you like Mrs. Thatcher does about Russians.

390
00:24:56,333 --> 00:25:00,792
That might be imaginary. But this is real and I am telling you

391
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:05,917
it’s going to come to us. It will come as diseases, selfdestruction.

392
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:09,625
But the greatest thing is the failure of the Divine Itself

393
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:13,999
that it could not communicate with you people,

394
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:16,083
who were made specially,

395
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:19,291
who were brought to this earth on this time,

396
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,959
who have to have the kingdom of heaven.

397
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:25,959
And suddenly you find they all dropped out of the sieve.

398
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:35,250
Sahaja Yogis also sometimes feel very frustrated, I know.

399
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:38,458
But whatever it is, as far as I am concerned,

400
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,792
I have tremendous desire now.

401
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:44,999
But I am so desireless, that this desire also may not work out.

402
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,041
You see, I am a desireless person.

403
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,500
Now what to do?

404
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:51,166
So I ask Sahaja Yogis to desire

405
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:54,792
that the people should have that great desire

406
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:56,999
to become the spirit.

407
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:58,792
This is the greatest thing

408
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:03,417
that we can give to our brothers and sisters,

409
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:08,291
to the progeny, to the people who are children today,

410
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,917
to this beautiful world.

411
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,834
We need these beautiful lights

412
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,792
and the beautiful time which they all have to enjoy.

413
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:24,750
I hope those who have come for the first time

414
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,999
will understand My difficulty

415
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:31,750
and will try to see that you desire

416
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:35,959
only your Self-realization and nothing else.

417
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:40,500
Just desire that. I request you to desire your Self-realization

418
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:44,417
and forget about everything, even if you are managing director

419
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:47,041
or may be the King George the Vth, you see?

420
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,834
Better keep all your shoes outside about it,

421
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,542
and just desire that you become the spirit.

422
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:03,709
You see the difference between Me and Christ is here:

423
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:08,792
He got so fed up that He said, "Let Me be crucified."

424
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:12,166
I mean of course it was in the plan that He should be crucified also

425
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,291
but I mean that won’t solve the problem now.

426
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,041
I have to see that you all get your resurrection somehow.

427
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,917
It’s like a mother’s desire who wants to give a bath to the child

428
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,291
and get him cleansed somehow, you see.

429
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,542
So whichever way you like – whether you like a chocolate

430
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,667
or whether you like a little rebuking

431
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:35,083
or whatever way you like, I am willing to work it out,

432
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:39,166
but please at least desire that you have to have

433
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,667
your Self-realization.

434
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,375
May God bless you all.

435
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:45,792
I hope those who get realization

436
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,041
will settle down with it seriously,

437
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,709
understand it is your responsibility today

438
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:53,583
that you are born today here in this country,

439
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:57,166
which is a special thing for Me and for Sahaja Yoga,

440
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,834
and that you should get your Self-realization,

441
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,875
understand it very well and digest it and go into it

442
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:11,709
and become a very, very powerful personality that you have to be.

443
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:14,125
But even a small thing like that, they said,

444
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:16,208
‘You take out your shoes.’ Because, you see,

445
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:18,875
shoes make you little bit tightened up.

446
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:22,083
Even that much if you ask them, oh, they,

447
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:26,041
as if I’ve asked a hundred pounds from them!

448
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,125
Even that little thing they don’t want to do

449
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,250
and why are they here, I don’t understand,

450
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,625
all the way they come for what?

451
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:35,792
You don’t want to get your realization?

452
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:43,375
You don’t want to get the greatest blessing of the Divine?

453
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:47,083
Then what am I to do? How am I to deal with you?

454
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:51,166
You may be very well educated person, all right, a learned man,

455
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:54,583
but you have not known so far.

456
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,125
It happens with gurus, it happens with everyone,

457
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,041
they are sticking on to a guru;

458
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,375
they are sticking on to a guru

459
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,458
they cannot give up that guru, whatever it is,

460
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:06,875
is another kind of a ego because they think of,

461
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:09,125
‘All right, we have eaten the crow; so what

462
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,417
if we have eaten the crow, we have eaten the crow!

463
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,750
So, go ahead with it.’ This is another category of people

464
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:18,709
who don’t want to give up whatever is nonsensical.

465
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:22,417
Then the third category is another one who are just waiting,

466
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:26,250
‘All right, let the catastrophe come.

467
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:28,959
We are just waiting.’ I mean, they told Me,

468
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,792
‘Mother, doesn’t matter, don’t You worry,

469
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:33,166
we are all waiting for the catastrophe,

470
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:35,959
disaster.When is it going to arrive? You just tell us that.

471
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:37,458
We are all anxiously waiting.

472
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:39,291
If it is coming, it’s a very good thing,

473
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,999
now we are reconciled to a situation like that.’

474
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:44,083
On the streets of Paris, if you go there,

475
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,917
you find many like that, discussing,

476
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,208
when are the ten stars going to meet

477
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:54,750
so that we are all collided and made into a jam.

478
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:59,208
We won’t be made into a jam, I must tell you,

479
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:03,542
but something horrible which is thousand times worse

480
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:09,208
than what you are doing on the streets of Paris.

481
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:17,208
But this kind of attitude of three types of people,

482
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:21,750
I don’t know, I may, I’m thinking, now I have been in London

483
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:26,166
for so many days and My going time is coming

484
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:29,166
and I don’t know what’s going to happen now,

485
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:30,999
because Sahaja Yogis themselves are desperate

486
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,333
and they all want to settle down in India.

487
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:37,959
I will not allow them to settle down in India unless and until

488
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:42,458
they at least get half of the English people realized.

489
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:47,041
Yes, that’s for very sure.

490
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,041
If you think that now Mother has gone there,

491
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,166
so let us take our baggage there and let settle down

492
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:55,250
in a nice little ashram enjoying yourself, nothing doing!

493
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:56,750
You have to work hard.

494
00:30:56,959 --> 00:31:00,083
You have to get at least half of the British people realized

495
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,166
somehow; if you can’t do it, you’re not allowed

496
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:10,125
to enjoy any rest and I, too, will not be able to have any rest

497
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:13,875
in My lifetime, if these things do not happen.

498
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:17,999
I hope you all understand My concern,

499
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:24,917
My great concern and My love for British people here

500
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,417
who must understand also their place

501
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:32,667
in this great work of God, how they should come up.

502
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:33,999
May God bless you all.

503
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:38,667
I'll have some water to drink.

504
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,083
I think I'll be better off here.

505
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:43,875
Press the feet.

506
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:48,041
I'm very much better here.

507
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:52,667
Any questions? Please!

508
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:00,750
So, you are here? So nice to see you!

509
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,417
What's happening in the Isle of Wight?

510
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,208
Are you there?

511
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:14,500
Me?

512
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:17,792
I'm not from the Isle of Wight. I'm from Hampstead.

513
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:22,583
We have some people there? I don't know.

514
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:27,417
We have to try all kinds of things.

515
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,083
Now, what's the question is?

516
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,792
I can't read your minds. Please tell me.

517
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:08,041
It's all right. They are all right there.

518
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:17,125
What's the question?

519
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,000
No questions?

520
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:26,834
There could be a question:

521
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,667
"How to have the desire?"

522
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:36,125
Isn't it? If somebody asked me a question like that,

523
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:39,000
"How to have the desire, Mother, tell us?", you see, it would be,

524
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:42,750
"How to have the desire to eat the icecream?", you see?

525
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:55,959
Sometimes you don't know whether to cry or to laugh.

526
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:57,999
It's like that.

527
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,917
How many people have come for the first time? Please raise your hands.

528
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,999
Lots of them. Good, good, good...

529
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:18,041
I would say, those who have come the first time should come forward

530
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,667
and sahaja yogis should go back.

531
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,750
Come on, turn to the back.

532
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,208
[INAUDIBLE] will go back.

533
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:40,999
Yes, come along. Sit down, sit down, sit down, yes.

534
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:47,208
First or second row, please be seated.

535
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:51,667
Will you be comfortable? Sure?

536
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:52,875
Yes, yes...

537
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:55,500
Will you be comfortable there, down below?

538
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:57,542
No, you can sit in the second row, if you want

539
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,166
and if you are not comfortable, it is not easy to sit on the ground.

540
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:04,625
Why don't you put the chairs around, like that?

541
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:07,375
So they'll get you some chairs there and some chairs here

542
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:10,792
Can you bring here some chairs, in the first line?

543
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,291
Just put it there, now.

544
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:19,959
You can bring it...

545
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:22,208
[MOTHER SPEAKS HINDI]

546
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:25,417
[INAUDIBLE]

547
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:29,875
What's about - they are fixed?

548
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,250
Fixed, they're?

549
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:33,166
I'm sorry for that.

550
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,458
The whole thing, you can bring it, yes, yes.

551
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:53,709
Let us sit there, you have to be comfortable, my child.

552
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:55,375
Let her be... She will be comfortable.

553
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,709
You have to be comfortable, that's first thing.

554
00:35:57,917 --> 00:36:00,625
Right? Wherever you are comfortable, please be seated.

555
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:02,083
Good.

556
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:03,792
You see, so many new people.

557
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:07,999
It's such a great thing.

558
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,333
That's all, that's all, they don't want...

559
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:24,625
They, they are... They say they are happy here.

560
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:42,625
Now...

561
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:46,291
Is a very simple thing

562
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:51,375
that Kundalini is to be awakened within you

563
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,583
because she's there,

564
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,417
she has been there

565
00:36:57,208 --> 00:37:01,709
and she gets awakened by itself,

566
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:05,542
spontanous, don't have to do anything. It's all yours.

567
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:09,125
Only thing, as Gavin must have told you that

568
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,667
an enlightened light can enlighten another light.

569
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,250
In the same way,

570
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:18,083
if I am an enlightened person, you should get your enlightenment.

571
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:22,375
And it works in no time, should work in no time.

572
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:25,834
If you can put your hands just like this,

573
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:28,083
now, I must give you explanation,

574
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:31,083
I'm not going to take anything from you.

575
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,750
It's just because these fingers denote your centers.

576
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:39,375
These are five fingers, six and seven are the left side

577
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,208
centers, these are right side centers.

578
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,083
When they are crossed together, you form the central path

579
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:49,500
which is the one we call as the Sushumna.

580
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:54,041
Now the central path manifests what we call in

581
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:58,291
the medical terminology as parasympathetic nervous system.

582
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:05,083
Now, this central path is - has got one left and one right

583
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:06,792
in - on one center.

584
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:11,375
So, what we do is to put our hands like this

585
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:15,125
so that these ends, which are receptive,

586
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:17,917
are the ends of the sympathetic nervous system,

587
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:21,709
so the left and the right sympathetic system gets enlightened

588
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:24,999
which is fixed here, like this, you see?

589
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:29,417
So what we do is to just put your hands like this,

590
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,166
towards Me,

591
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,834
without putting any pressure or anything,

592
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:36,458
on your lap. Be comfortable.

593
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:38,959
Be comfortable.

594
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:44,083
Now, you may have to loosen little bit if there is something tight

595
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:46,709
or making you uncomfortable, that's all.

596
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:47,625
And the feet,

597
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:51,500
is better if you are sitting on the ground is all right or any way,

598
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:54,250
but if they are on the Mother Earth, it helps.

599
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,917
But if you like it, like you are sitting, is all right,

600
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:01,417
doesn't matter. Put your hands straight like this.

601
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:06,667
Makes no difference whatever way you have been putting your hands,

602
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:11,250
just the fingers should come towards Me, that's all.

603
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:13,166
Facing towards Me.

604
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Now, it doesn't matter from what race, creed,

605
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,917
coulor, whatever way you are coming here.

606
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:22,375
And also doesn't matter whatever you have done before.

607
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:25,542
Now, we are here at this present moment.

608
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:28,458
This moment is important for Me.

609
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:32,667
At this moment, you are here

610
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:38,375
to jump into the new awareness of Self-realization.

611
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:41,542
So, this is the most important time -

612
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:43,625
for Me and for you.

613
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:48,041
At this time, forget about the past and the future.

614
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,875
Say, somebody thinks that he is guilty

615
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,875
of something, I mean that's a fashion these days,

616
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,375
to feel guilty is a fashion.

617
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:56,917
In the West it's a fashion.

618
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:59,583
Just for nothing, why to feel guilty, I can't understand.

619
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,750
An Indian will never feel guilty, you know, whatever they may do.

620
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:06,875
And this fashion of feeling guilty

621
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:10,000
really clutches Me from here to here sometimes

622
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,792
when I am talking to the Western people.

623
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,583
At the first outset

624
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:18,625
you must know that you are not guilty at all in the presence of God.

625
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,959
In the eyes of God you are not guilty

626
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,834
and you have no business to condemn yourself,

627
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:28,750
because you are going to be the temple of God.

628
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:31,500
And now don't feel guilty about yourself.

629
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:36,458
You have not even made your nose, what are you feeling guilty about?

630
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:41,625
So just have a very cheerful disposition about yourself,

631
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:43,834
that you are not guilty,

632
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,917
that you are going to be the spirit,

633
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:49,750
the beauty, the glory that you are.

634
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,333
And there is no need to feel guilty at all!

635
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:54,875
Is very important. At the very outset,

636
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,500
I will request you not to feel guilty.

637
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,208
That's first thing you have to do.

638
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,959
Sincerely

639
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:04,500
you have to say to yourself, "I'm not guilty at all".

640
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,208
Because there's a big block here sitting, just now,

641
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:09,375
into everybody's left side.

642
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:11,375
And that's how they get spondylitis

643
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:13,959
so much so that I may get one day spondylitis,

644
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:15,542
the way people are getting it.

645
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:19,500
So we are not to feel guilty at all, we have to decide on that point.

646
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:22,208
Whatever people might have told you,

647
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,583
that we are the greatest sinners or whatever it is,

648
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:30,375
in the presence of God's love

649
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:35,041
we cannot feel guilty, because we challenge His powers

650
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:36,750
of forgiveness.

651
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:40,792
He has a power to forgive,

652
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:45,417
and He forgives such big sins that what sins can we commit, isn't it?

653
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:47,083
So just don't feel guilty,

654
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:50,458
that is the first thing I have explained to you.

655
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:52,417
By reading all these horrible books

656
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:54,834
I think people also start feeling guilty.

657
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:57,875
I don't know how, what are the... what are the sources are,

658
00:41:58,125 --> 00:41:59,333
but is a very common practice,

659
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:02,125
I don't know where they sell this business of guilt

660
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:05,709
but definitely people are feeling guilty for nothing at all.

661
00:42:05,999 --> 00:42:09,125
So I would request you not to feel guilty,

662
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:13,250
put your hands towards Me and just close your eyes.

663
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:15,458
Just close your eyes.

664
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:22,250
Now, how do I manage it?

665
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:23,999
I must tell you now.

666
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,959
Is very simple for Me.

667
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:29,166
What I do, that, with My attention,

668
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:32,208
I put you, all of you, in My heart.

669
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:33,917
I can do it.

670
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:37,792
Supposing you know how to put someone in your heart,

671
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:40,250
you can also do it very easy.

672
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:42,166
You are all in My heart.

673
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:45,875
Supposing I conceive you in My heart, you can say like that,

674
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,667
and raise My Kundalini,

675
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:52,750
and bring it to the fontanelle bone area

676
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:57,875
where resides the seat of My spirit

677
00:42:58,333 --> 00:42:59,625
and then touches,

678
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:01,542
My own Kundalini

679
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,250
touches

680
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,625
the spirit, the seat of the spirit,

681
00:43:09,542 --> 00:43:11,208
and when it happens,

682
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:17,834
then you all feel that you have got your realization.

683
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:21,041
You feel the realization.

684
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,250
This is how it happens.

685
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:32,375
But when you people get your realization,

686
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,709
you also get the same powers.

687
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,875
And you can give realization to others

688
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:42,166
just by raising your hands behind the back of the people

689
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:44,083
whom you want to give realization.

690
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:47,625
It is a very simple method worked out very simply,

691
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:51,041
by nature, by the living process of evolution.

692
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:54,250
Now close your eyes properly,

693
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:57,333
put your hands towards Me.

694
00:43:58,333 --> 00:43:59,625
As a result of this,

695
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:05,291
first thing, you start noticing in your thoughts,

696
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,959
ask your mind, "What are you thinking?"

697
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:12,583
Keep your eyes shut, fully,

698
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,208
that's important.

699
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,792
You'll find that there is no answer.

700
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:30,166
In many of you, you'll find that the answers are running away.

701
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:31,875
When you are trying to catch

702
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:35,959
the answer, there is no answer, is all running away.

703
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:39,041
That's the best situation.

704
00:44:39,417 --> 00:44:42,750
When the mind is resting for the change, you see, it's not thinking.

705
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:56,625
When this has happened within you, then we have to start

706
00:44:57,999 --> 00:44:59,333
acting on our desire.

707
00:44:59,834 --> 00:45:04,625
So the left hand represents the desire that we have,

708
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:06,999
so keep the left hand fixed towards Me

709
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:10,250
and with the right hand now you have to act.

710
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,500
Don't open your eyes at any cost,

711
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:16,417
please don't open your eyes at any cost.

712
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:19,500
Put your right hand on your heart.

713
00:45:19,709 --> 00:45:23,834
If you're wearing a coat, put your hand inside the coat.

714
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:26,999
Put it on your heart on the left-hand side.

715
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:29,542
Put the left hand straight towards Me.

716
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:31,834
Stretched out, now.

717
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:38,750
Now you have to ask a question to yourself in your heart,

718
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:41,792
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

719
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,333
Ask the question. Which you are!

720
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,166
But you better ask the question in the beginning because the

721
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:49,208
attitude just now is:

722
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,041
Whether I am the spirit or not,

723
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,625
even if the Mother says, you need not believe it.

724
00:45:54,959 --> 00:45:56,750
So just say, "Mother, am I the spirit?"

725
00:45:56,959 --> 00:45:59,875
Keep your eyes shut fully.

726
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:04,333
Ask sincerely.

727
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,999
Now, if you are the spirit,

728
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:23,291
then you have to be your master also.

729
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,709
Now you can put the same hand

730
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:30,500
down below on another center on the left-hand side on the stomach.

731
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,999
On the stomach on the left-hand side quite lower,

732
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:39,999
and ask a question in the center on the left-hand side,

733
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:42,291
in the central part of the stomach,

734
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:44,458
and ask a question,

735
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:47,500
"Mother, am I my own master?"

736
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:51,166
"Am I my own guru?"

737
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:35,792
Ask this question at least ten times.

738
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:42,291
Sincerely, from your heart, with confidence,

739
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:48,458
ask the question, "Mother, am I my own master?"

740
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:02,083
Now, put the right hand again on your heart.

741
00:48:03,667 --> 00:48:05,834
Now, at this point,

742
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,834
you have to confidently say

743
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:11,583
that "Mother, I am the spirit."

744
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:15,166
You have to confidently say that "Mother, I am the spirit."

745
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,667
Say it twelve times please.

746
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:21,166
"Mother, I am the spirit!" You are the spirit.

747
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:23,999
Everyone has said that you are the spirit.

748
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:26,375
And you are to be born

749
00:48:26,792 --> 00:48:27,834
again.

750
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,333
Just assert.

751
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:15,834
Now raise your right hand higher

752
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:19,709
onto the base of your neck, the left side.

753
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:23,709
Again, we are working on the left because of the desire.

754
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:26,417
Base of the neck on the left-hand side,

755
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:31,291
where I told you is a big block of guilt.

756
00:49:31,959 --> 00:49:34,959
Now if you are the spirit, how can you be guilty?

757
00:49:35,959 --> 00:49:38,083
Because the spirit never commits sins,

758
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,792
is guiltless,

759
00:49:39,999 --> 00:49:40,999
is perfect,

760
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:42,333
is absolute.

761
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:44,333
So now you say "Mother,"

762
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:47,125
"I'm not guilty"

763
00:49:47,709 --> 00:49:49,458
with full confidence and sixteen times,

764
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:52,125
and if you have been too much guilty, say it thirty-two times.

765
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:55,999
That's...

766
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:57,333
That's a better punishment.

767
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:59,792
'Cause I am suffering because of your guilt.

768
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:08,917
For anything, even for smoking or drinking or anything,

769
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:11,959
don't feel guilty. Forget it.

770
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,917
Serious or trivial things, don't feel guilty.

771
00:50:22,959 --> 00:50:24,999
You have to respect yourself, isn't it?

772
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:26,625
If you are the spirit.

773
00:50:34,917 --> 00:50:35,917
Now.

774
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:38,041
Better now.

775
00:50:52,834 --> 00:50:54,834
Because you really don't know what you are,

776
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,709
that's why you are feeling guil... guilty, I really tell you.

777
00:50:58,792 --> 00:51:00,999
When you will know what you are,

778
00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:03,333
you'll be enamored

779
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:05,333
to know.

780
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:08,625
Please believe Me.

781
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,458
Don't condemn yourself at all.

782
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:21,333
No confessions.

783
00:51:22,834 --> 00:51:26,625
And no past to be brought in just now. Please forget the past.

784
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,125
Don't try to count all of them one by one.

785
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:32,458
At this time it's very important.

786
00:51:32,709 --> 00:51:35,583
I know what you are doing, some of you.

787
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,792
Forget it.

788
00:51:41,834 --> 00:51:43,750
Just forget it.

789
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:48,291
Whatever others might have said

790
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:50,125
just forget it, for heaven's sake!

791
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:58,083
Now raise this right hand over your forehead.

792
00:51:58,709 --> 00:51:59,709
Just.

793
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,083
This is the crown of your head

794
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:07,625
where we have not been able to forgive others.

795
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,709
The one who wears a crown has to forgive others.

796
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:15,667
So what we have to say that "Mother,

797
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,999
I forgive everyone."

798
00:52:19,542 --> 00:52:21,625
Is the simplest thing to do

799
00:52:21,999 --> 00:52:26,875
because those who say it is difficult, they don't know it's a myth.

800
00:52:27,834 --> 00:52:31,083
When you forgive your - others, what are you doing? Nothing.

801
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:34,375
And when you don't forgive,what do you do? Nothing.

802
00:52:34,792 --> 00:52:38,959
Only thing when you don't forgive, then only you torture yourself

803
00:52:39,166 --> 00:52:42,959
and play into the hands of people who wanted to trouble you.

804
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:48,999
So just say with full heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

805
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:57,291
Now, you can put your hand on your head.

806
00:52:58,166 --> 00:53:02,792
On your head in the center where you had a

807
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:06,500
fontanelle bone area being soft in your childhood,

808
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,750
and press it with your palm,

809
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:12,125
you yourself, you are taking your own realization,

810
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:14,500
so press it with your palm,

811
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:17,291
in a clockwise manner,

812
00:53:17,792 --> 00:53:20,875
clockwise manner. Put your full palm on your head,

813
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:23,291
in front, a little, it's in the front side,

814
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:27,375
and press it and move it, your palm, move it like that, yes, palm.

815
00:53:27,834 --> 00:53:30,834
Move it. Press it hard.

816
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:37,375
At this point, we have to say

817
00:53:37,959 --> 00:53:41,375
that, "Mother, I want my realization."

818
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:45,834
Because as I told you, I cannot cross your freedom.

819
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:49,458
So you have to say: "Mother, please give me realization."

820
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:52,250
Otherwise I cannot do it, I'm sorry.

821
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:56,125
That's the trouble with Me, is that I can't do it on My own.

822
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,166
So I'm requesting you to say

823
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:01,834
"Mother, I want my realization."

824
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:05,333
It's all right, you've got it.

825
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:11,041
Now raise your hand,

826
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,750
about four inches, and see if there's a cool breeze coming out.

827
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:19,083
You have to see for yourself.

828
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:22,125
There? It's there.

829
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:26,333
All right, now change over, you can change over and see.

830
00:54:26,542 --> 00:54:29,000
Don't open your eyes, just change over and see.

831
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:31,999
Put your right hand towards Me.

832
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:33,625
Right hand like this

833
00:54:33,834 --> 00:54:35,125
and now put the left hand

834
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,792
and see if there's a cool breeze coming out

835
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:45,542
See on your head,

836
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,792
from your head, if there is a cool breeze coming out.

837
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:50,792
Now don't think about it.

838
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,792
You can't think, by thinking it has not... There?

839
00:54:56,709 --> 00:54:58,125
It is very subtle.

840
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:03,083
Started in the hands, come to your head,

841
00:55:03,417 --> 00:55:04,583
Is working out,

842
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:06,875
working out, woeking out.

843
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:09,500
Change your hands again, whenever you want to.

844
00:55:09,709 --> 00:55:11,083
Change your hand. See for yourself,

845
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:13,417
and don't you worry even if you don't feel it,

846
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:17,959
we have so many people here who can again enforce it.

847
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:28,750
Don't become serious, is going to be there. You just don't worry.

848
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:31,917
None of you are missing your Kundalini.

849
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:34,500
I can assure you, it's all there.

850
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,083
May take a little more time for some people,

851
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:39,041
less time for some people, makes no difference.

852
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,834
Don't condemn yourself

853
00:55:40,999 --> 00:55:42,083
and don't be serious.

854
00:55:42,291 --> 00:55:45,041
Put your hand a little lower and move it up and down.

855
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,709
Some people might be feeling in the hand.

856
00:55:57,999 --> 00:56:00,667
Some people will feel it in the hand,

857
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:02,500
the hand that is towards Me.

858
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:14,291
On here, ask them to see here.

859
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:25,458
Now the Sahaja Yogis can see, but need not talk or touch,

860
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,417
just see if they,

861
00:56:27,792 --> 00:56:29,041
you are feeling it.

862
00:56:32,709 --> 00:56:33,999
She's got it.

863
00:56:36,542 --> 00:56:37,999
It's very subtle.

864
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:39,792
Got it?

865
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:42,250
What about him? Go on, just see,

866
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,542
the gentleman next to you,

867
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:46,083
is a realized soul.

868
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:50,333
He's already there.

869
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:51,667
Then

870
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:56,583
see this gentleman touched it and again he is thinking about it.

871
00:57:06,542 --> 00:57:07,959
Now don't think about it,

872
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,625
please don't think about it.

873
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:19,875
There are wonderful people here in Holborn, I must say.

874
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:21,166
It's a wonderful place.

875
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:22,792
Come to you.

876
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,750
