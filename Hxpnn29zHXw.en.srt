1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,400
So to love God is even more difficult,

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,480
without seeing Him, without knowing Him,

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,160
without knowing His bounties, without getting realization.

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,440
It is very difficult.

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,960
But today that is not the case.

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:47,160
But still you have to have no fear in your mind: trust!

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,920
you trust yourself and trust others.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,600
First of all try to trust yourself.

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,680
If you have made mistakes, you have to say,

10
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,320
“Yes, I have made mistakes, all right. So what?”

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,680
Trust yourself that you can correct yourself also.

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,480
Trusting doesn’t mean blind ego trip. It does not mean that.

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,280
Trust means that “Yes I can correct myself.

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,600
I can improve. I can do better.”

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,840
Some people think that if you trust yourself

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,520
then you should never confess anything that you have done wrong.

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,880
That you should never say that it was wrong and I can correct.

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,600
This is a wrong idea.

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,120
You have to trust yourself by saying that,

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,560
“Yes I have done mistakes. I have been doing wrong.

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,760
I have been faltering but I can correct.

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,720
I have that strength within me.

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,640
I can rise above all these things.

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:01,480
I have that thing within me which I can use to my advantage.”

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,320
Trust yourself.

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,560
Trust that you are realized souls.

27
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,640
Trust that God loves you.

28
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,680
That He has chosen you to be His instrument.

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,880
Love yourself.

30
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,160
You are unique no doubt.

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,680
As it is human beings, every individual is a unique person.

32
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:39,720
But after realization you are definitely unique person.

33
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,720
It never means ego trip.

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,600
One has to use discretion about understanding.

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,400
It never means ego trip.

36
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,480
If you cannot correct yourself, you are not master of yourself.

37
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,080
Yes you are not perfect.

38
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,520
You are unique but you are not perfect.

39
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,680
You have to perfect yourself.

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,080
These words can be very confusing.

41
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,560
When I say you are unique

42
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,600
immediately, you think you are perfect.

43
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,840
These are two words, unique and perfect.

44
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,920
Somebody can be unique

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,080
but he can have imperfections.

46
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,960
So you have to perfect yourself.

47
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,000
And trust in yourself that you can perfect yourself,

48
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,840
through your kundalini awakening,

49
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,640
clearing your chakras.

50
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,240
By understanding yourself, you can perfect yourself.

51
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,000
You have to perfect.

52
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,560
I have so many ways I tell you; directly,

53
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,680
sometimes indirectly, through friends,

54
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,600
somehow point out that this is the problem with you.

55
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,400
You should think that I am within you.

56
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,520
I am that part within you which is discretion.

57
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,200
When you do not understand your own discretion,

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,400
I try to give you the direction by this way or that way.

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,080
But people feel hurt. People feel bad

60
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,080
or, some of them accept it.

61
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,160
If you are seekers and if you are ascending,

62
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,080
you are definitely unique, specially blessed.

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,520
And you have to pay special attention to yourself.

64
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,680
You can’t afford to play with yourself.

65
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,000
So you have to discriminate between ego

66
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,280
or ego trips as they call it

67
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,080
and ascent.

68
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,920
Ego trips bring you back with the worst hurting.

69
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,720
It would be something like throwing you in the air

70
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,560
and again you come back with a bump

71
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,120
and break one of your legs or something like that.

72
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,120
That’s what ego trip is.

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,400
But ascent is where you really rise above.

74
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:37,120
Not only that you rise but with you,

75
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,360
you make others rise.

76
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,240
In your ascent, you develop tremendous powers.

77
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,560
The higher you ascend the better it is.

78
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,840
But not by understanding that I am perfect you can ascend,

79
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,080
never so.

80
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,240
There’s a story of a teacher and his student.

81
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,200
The teacher was very kind to the student

82
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,720
and he would come and show him his creations.

83
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,200
He was very kind to him.

84
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,880
And every time he would say that,

85
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,040
“I have done this good

86
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,440
and this is the thing that I have not been able to do

87
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,720
so will you please tell me how to correct it?”

88
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,560
And the teacher would say, “Yes, good,

89
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,640
you better correct this part, then do this.”

90
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,720
And one day the student came and said, “Now this is perfect”.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,560
He said, “You are no more student now.”

92
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,600
So he said, “No more. You are not to come to me anymore.”

93
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:05,960
There was another student who was coming every day

94
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,200
and correcting himself.

95
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,720
And he told to his teacher that,

96
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,680
“Today I think I can teach others but not yet perfect”.

97
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,760
He said, “All right you go and teach.”

98
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,120
The third one was a student who came

99
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,440
and he was always trying to see

100
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,400
what was the mistake and how he has to correct

101
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,960
and how he worked very hard, very assiduous, very hard working

102
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:52,320
and he came to his teacher one day and he said, “Sir,

103
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,080
I will not trouble you anymore now”.

104
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,840
He said, “True. Now you take my seat.”

105
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,200
That is what one has to understand.

106
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,440
You ascend. You will become humbler.

107
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,040
It is just the other way around people understand.

108
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,640
You see when they ascend they think we have achieved

109
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,440
some special powers. I don’t know.

110
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,760
Suddenly self-certification starts you see.

111
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,280
I am very good in spirituality.

112
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,000
I am very high up and all that. This self-certificate time.

113
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,880
And then it can reach such a point

114
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,560
that suddenly you found you are on the earth again.

115
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,360
This kind of thing is not the way it works out.

116
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,920
Actually the people who ascend

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,760
there are certain qualities that show on them.

118
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,360
The first thing is your collectivity.

119
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,920
How collective you are.

120
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,960
With how many people you can carry on.

121
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,240
At how many things you can laugh.

122
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,160
That is one of the biggest quali  ties.

123
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,480
The second quality is that how much you accept

124
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,960
another’s domination who cuts down your collectivity.

125
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,440
You must have your personality separate from everyone.

126
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,240
If you allow others to cut your personality,

127
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,680
say for example, there is a boss and you are the,

128
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,440
you are the employee.

129
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,200
And the boss is not realized soul and you are a realized soul.

130
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,680
Or maybe both are realized souls.

131
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,440
Take it like that.

132
00:09:52,520 --> 00:10:00,120
And one of them is ascending.

133
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,080
Then he becomes humbler, he becomes better,

134
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,320
there are congenial relationship. But to a point.

135
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,040
He will never compromise with his boss

136
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,880
when it comes to his ascent, to his collectivity,

137
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,560
to his giving, to his doing things for others.

138
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,200
On that point he’ll never have any domination

139
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,960
because how much you feel responsible about yourself

140
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,720
is the second point.

141
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,320
How much you are responsible to be there,

142
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,840
to be a cell in the heart.

143
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,680
Any cell that fails, fails the heart.

144
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,440
Every cell in the heart has to be extremely sensitive

145
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,320
and extremely obedient

146
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,800
to the Self, to the Spirit.

147
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,200
It has to activate, work harder

148
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,880
when there is need there emergency.

149
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,960
That it enjoys the most.

150
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,760
And no impurity should be allowed,

151
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,680
the third point now.

152
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,600
As I told you first is collectivity,

153
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,600
secondly your responsibility

154
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,640
and third point is purity.

155
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,880
Purity of your own heart first of all,

156
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,720
of your own heart, about sincerity, cunningness.

157
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,880
As I am saying this you will be realizing that

158
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,600
all Englishmen believe in the contrary,

159
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,600
nowadays, not olden times, but nowadays.

160
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,360
Clean heart, transparent, open heart.

161
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,320
Trust others.

162
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,880
Talk to everyone with an open heart.

163
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,080
Trust others.

164
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,320
Why do you doubt?

165
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,800
If you do not doubt yourself, you’ll not doubt others.

166
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,240
What are they going to take away from you?

167
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,800
What have you got?

168
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,200
Nobody can take away your nose, eyes, nothing.

169
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,640
It’s all quite intact.

170
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,560
It’s all nicely glued down.

171
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,040
So nothing is going to disappear.

172
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,240
What are they going to hurt

173
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,840
to a person who is a realized soul?

174
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
If your heart is clean,

175
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,840
you can see the other person clearly through and through.

176
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,520
Innocence is such a powerful thing,

177
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,440
such a powerful thing that even a glance

178
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,680
is sufficient to kill a Satan.

179
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,840
Purity of heart,

180
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,760
actually when the heart becomes impure

181
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,640
the impurity flows down to other places.

182
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,520
It is not the other way round, is from the heart.

183
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,200
Many people believe that it’s the body that becomes impure.

184
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,200
I think it is the heart,

185
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,600
which becomes really impure,

186
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,320
and then it starts to cling down to the body

187
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:54,880
and then it is residual there. It settles down there.

188
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,800
So have a clean open heart like a child’s heart.

189
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,240
Open heart.

190
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,320
What is there to be afraid of anyone?

191
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,680
What is there not to trust anyone?

192
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,720
What is there to be angry with anyone?

193
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,080
Talk to everyone, shake hands with everyone,

194
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,640
be nice to everyone.

195
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,560
On the w ay you find somebody’s difficulty,

196
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,120
give him a hand.

197
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,240
If somebody cannot sit properly or has a problem

198
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,000
you try to remove the problem.

199
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,600
If the person cannot stand, give the place

200
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,560
Try to give from your clean heart.

201
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:51,120
If your heart is not clean, it can never give.

202
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,840
Now how do you clean the heart is the subject

203
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,080
which Felicity wanted me to discuss, how to clean the heart.

204
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,920
There is no broom available for that

205
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,640
in the supermarket.

206
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:17,640
There are no Fairy liquids or anything to wash it down.

207
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,560
But there is a way.

208
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,400
Allow your heart to be drenched in your Mother’s love.

209
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,680
Just allow. See how much She loves you.

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,920
I trust you.

211
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,880
People laugh at Me sometimes.

212
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,040
Some of these saints who are supposed to be very great people,

213
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,040
they can’t understand how I trust you.

214
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,160
They say that oh these are all lost cases.

215
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,560
These are horrible people how do you trust them?

216
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,840
They are not sanyasis,

217
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,240
they are not sadhus, they are nothing.

218
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,320
They are ordinary people.

219
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,200
For them I mean your value is nothing.

220
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,200
They’ll if you go to them they will make you stand on your head

221
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,440
for three months.

222
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,400
For three years, they may hang you on a well.

223
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,000
I don’t know what they will do to test you.

224
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,080
But I trusted you the day I saw you.

225
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,280
The day you came to me I trusted you.

226
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,720
And I worked on you from the very first day,

227
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,000
knowing what you are

228
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,720
but I trust your Spirit

229
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,000
that it would shine.

230
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,200
In the same way, trust. We laugh at others.

231
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,800
I have seen Sahaja Yogis laugh at others;

232
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,000
make fun of them when they come to Me.

233
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,960
Trust them.

234
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,680
When you will trust them, you will respect them also.

235
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,680
So you have to believe

236
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:08,960
in yourself and enjoy the way

237
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,520
gently you are sweeping

238
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,080
into the current of your Mother’s love.

239
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,360
Just enjoy that.

240
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,280
Like a flower that falls into the current

241
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,840
and flows and enjoys all the beauties of that current.

242
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:42,200
In the same way, you should enjoy.

243
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,720
When that enjoyment comes into you,

244
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,400
you will start trusting.

245
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,520
And trust your Mothe r.

246
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,320
I try many things to correct you.

247
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,120
But trust in one thing, that

248
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,200
whatever I try for you or do anything,

249
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:14,240
anything I may do for you it is just to clean you.

250
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,480
That’s My job.

251
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,360
May sometimes you might feel

252
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,960
I am publicly saying things for you.

253
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,800
May be your images are being ruined by that

254
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,960
or whatever you may think.

255
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,000
That’s not the way,

256
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,880
is for your hitha,

257
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,840
is for the well-being of your Spirit.

258
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,240
And that is the most difficult job.

259
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:02,000
With all this, trust in your heart.

260
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,000
First trust yourself,

261
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,440
trust others,

262
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,360
other Sahaja Yogis.

263
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,200
Love thy neighbor as thyself.

264
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,000
Who is your neighbor? He is a Sahaja Yogi.

265
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,680
Stand by him.

266
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,240
And trust your Mother.

267
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,520
As I have trusted you,

268
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,960
you have to trust Me,

269
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,400
and it will work out.

270
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:45,560
Open your heart to this trust.

271
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,320
You should not worry

272
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,880
whether it would be protocolish all right or not,

273
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:02,120
whether it would be absolutely respectable or not,

274
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,760
because heart knows.

275
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,560
Whatever your heart will do

276
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,280
in its genuine form will be respectable,

277
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,200
because there resides your Spirit, which manifests.

278
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,960
That will look after you.

279
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,920
By outer forms, whatever you try

280
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,360
is not going to work out.

281
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,320
It is that trust in your loving heart

282
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,920
that is going to work. It doesn’t matter.

283
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,840
You see today she brought some flowers.

284
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,440
There were some supposed to be weeds according to her.

285
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,120
She went to the station and there she was taking some flowers out.

286
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,760
And the station master and his wife were very sweet

287
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,160
and they said, “Oh go ahead.

288
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,880
They are only weeds you can have them.”

289
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,600
And they are so fragrant.

290
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,920
One of the most fragrant flowers I have ever seen.

291
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
They are just weeds.

292
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,240
They do not conform to any formal flowers,

293
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:07,240
but just few flowers attached to other flowers were most fragrant.

294
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,080
Love gives all the sophistication and the fragrance

295
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,760
and all the breeding that is required.

296
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:23,280
Not talking of love but really loving is the way,

297
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,800
it's most enjoyable.
