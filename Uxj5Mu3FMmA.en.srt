1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,280
And first you have this background, that they are seekers,

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,080
they are misled,

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,200
they are your brothers and sisters,

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,040
and they are been really taken into

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,200
the clutches of negativity.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,440
You have to move very, very carefully about it,

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,320
really careful.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,880
First of all they must feel your love and concern.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,760
That is very important.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,240
So instead losing temper with them or getting angry with them

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,760
you should really have

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,680
compassion,

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,840
because they are so unfortunate.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,080
They are so unfortunate.

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,880
Those who are not coming to Sahaja Yoga and are going the wrong way;

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,720
are so unfortunate people, they are lost people.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,560
Whatever they may say, but they are lost,

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,000
and you know that.

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,880
They are lost people.

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,000
And with

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,920
this myth that they are living,

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,160
they are going towards hell, actually.

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,360
And they have lost all chances for Realization if they don’t understand Sahaja Yoga, see?

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,000
You have to talk to them like that,

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,880
that, “How do you recognize him as your guru?

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,880
What has he done for you?

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,120
What powers has he given you?

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
You can be your own guru”.

29
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,360
Don’t start talking about Me, first of all.

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,720
No, not much.

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,480
You should say, “She does nothing. She just makes us our own guru,

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,120
and we know what is our problem is, we know your problem. You can work it out.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,640
That’s not difficult.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,320
But after all, if you are seekers,

35
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,520
what have you found out so far?”

36
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,920
I mean,

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,360
if you, there’s somebody who has been guiding,

38
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,600
you must see what he has done to others.

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,760
They might talk, they might say, “Oh, we have found the way, we have done”

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,560
But what way?

41
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,920
One thing one must ask:

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,760
“What have we got in our own awareness, in human awareness, what have we got?”

43
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,560
“What have we achieved?”

44
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,200
And that is how you will know,

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,560
because, you see, you are not manifesting your own powers.

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,760
You may be talking what guru says, what is written in that book.

47
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,080
Anybody can do it , what’s so great?

48
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,440
You are not manifesting your powers at all.

49
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,640
You have no powers of any kind, you are weak people.

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,520
It’s just a mass nonsense going on

51
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,600
that, people just follow somebody and another one follows, another one follows,

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,160
but one doesn’t see that what’s happening is everybody is running.

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,440
See, one doesn’t want to wait and see,

54
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,040
“Where are we? What are our moorings?”

55
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,320
You see. you must find out.

56
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,640
We must fathom out ourselves.

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,760
And you say you are feeling better; this may be ego pampering.

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,240
That’s not the thing. What has happened to your awareness is the point.

59
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,120
Can you judge others? Can you judge yourself on absolute points?

60
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,960
If you are at absolute points, and you judge

61
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,400
and supposing you say you judge like this,

62
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,640
are you sure that the other one will judge the same way?

63
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,880
You see, when you put a direct question like this, then they will answer.

64
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,000
You say, “You don’t try to deceive yourself we deceived ourselves in the same way.”

65
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,520
If you start on this that,

66
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,240
“We were like this, we were misled, we did all these mistakes”,

67
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,120
then they’ll understand.

68
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,600
Some of you should say that, “We went to drug side, you see, the left sided,

69
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,200
into hypnosis. It was hypnosis, first we didn’t know it was hypnosis.

70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,120
We were hypnotized.

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,800
We did not know, you see, we were so much enamored by their way, outward behavior

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,480
and this and that, that we never understood that it was hypnosis.”

73
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,160
But logically also you must understand,

74
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,880
that if we have organized ourselves as something,

75
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,040
are we really meaning it or it is another artificial thing,

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,920
just like a church or just like any other, other organization?

77
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,960
It’s not God’s organization. If so, do you understand?

78
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,040
And then with Sahaja Yoga you should say that,

79
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,160
“We can feel your Kundalini, we can feel our Kundalini,

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,680
we know our chakras, we know your chakras - we can feel it.

81
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,480
Even the children can feel it if they are realized souls.

82
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,160
We speak the same language.

83
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,960
We raise the Kundalini of others, by which we have cured people

84
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,880
of cancer, of many diseases, mental diseases, emotional diseases.

85
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,720
Can you do it?”

86
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,880
You should say: “You have no knowledge of the technique of God”.

87
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,240
Technique of Divine is different from our technique.

88
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,080
Just by sitting, standing, jumping, shouting, that’s not a technique.

89
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,760
The technique is that you should know where we are moving.

90
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,400
Then you can say about right sided people also that you say,

91
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,480
“We are God world government and an incarnation is born.”

92
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,120
“Where is he? He is dead now.

93
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,600
Who are you? Nothing, except that you have little money with you.

94
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,400
There are many people who have money

95
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,080
But organizing dead is not the way to organize.

96
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,600
You are deceiving yourself,

97
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,120
by this kind of a nonsensical talk.

98
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,520
This is all nonsensical, is all written down, in the scriptures.

99
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,600
If you know how to read the scriptures,

100
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,320
you can just interpret it and put it whatever you like

101
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,920
and if you know how assert and talk, you can write many books.

102
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,120
It’s nothing great.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,840
But can you read your own book?

104
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,080
Can you feel your own chakras?

105
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,200
Can you read another person’s chakras?

106
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,520
That’s the main thing.

107
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,960
You should say, “Our guru doesn’t want any money.

108
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,720
She is not even a guru, She is a Mother. She is so affectionate.

109
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,800
She doesn’t take any money, She doesn’t do anything.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,960
On the contrary, as Bala has said, She gives us presents,

111
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
She looks after us.”

112
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,680
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, I was talking to one gentleman. He is not Sahaja Yogi,

113
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,880
but he is very well known in the Brighton area,

114
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,080
and I said to him, “How do you see Sahaja Yoga

115
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,480
and how do other people who heard of Sahaja Yoga feel about it?”

116
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,880
And it seems that we’re still staying as being -

117
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,160
we are not very well known

118
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,120
and people still see us as a cult, Mother,

119
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,280
because, with all respect, Mother,

120
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,960
when, when they see a picture of somebody

121
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,640
with a name,

122
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,880
immediately the response is, “It’s just another organization, it’s a cult.”

123
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,960
Shri Mataji: Why? I mean My photo, this picture doesn’t look like that, does it?

124
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,640
Sahaja Yogi: No, Ma.

125
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,360
Shri Mataji: You should put this picture on.

126
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,560
I mean, you see, there is a difference, you must talk to them,

127
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,400
“It’s not a cult, because we have no organization, we have no membership,

128
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,280
we don’t pay anything firstly.

129
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,480
Then we, we all are

130
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,520
people who are aware of a new dimension in our awareness.

131
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,640
Even small children come.

132
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,080
We know, they know.

133
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,800
There is -

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,240
cult is a thing which creates fanaticism.

135
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,200
We have no fanaticism. We are open to all. All can come.”

136
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,960
They have to take their Realization, is the main point.

137
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,640
You see, our all attitude is absolutely subtle,

138
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,800
and we should say very, very

139
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,240
spiritual, because we say, “You must get your Realization”.

140
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,920
We don’t say, “You must pay so much money.” You see?

141
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,960
“You must get your Realization”.

142
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,440
“Secondly, you see, you people talk

143
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,720
of making sort of big funds and things for the growth”.

144
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
All right?

145
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,160
“But, we, we want the becoming.

146
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,520
We want what becomes of you, that’s important.

147
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
What becomes a person, what becomes of others.

148
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,320
Becoming!

149
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,200
So it’s a living thing.

150
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,280
And living things cannot be cults, you see? It’s a living thing.

151
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,600
What we want, you should get a new awareness in which you should grow,

152
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,720
and you should become effective, you see?

153
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,080
It’s not well known because we are not a cult.

154
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,880
That’s the main reason.”

155
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,040
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, these, these are gross people and

156
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,840
they, the general feeling amongst them is that if it’s Indian it’s got to be a cult.

157
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,600
Shri Mataji: Who?

158
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,320
Sahaja Yogi: Because it’s Indian, you see? Because You, because You, You took Your birth in India

159
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,800
Shri Mataji: What about the cults they are having in America and all over?

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,040
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, well, they see the Maharishi and they see the orange guy

161
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,400
and they just think: “Oh, it’s just another one!” It’s just the what they say.

162
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,520
Shri Mataji: You see, you must talk about India.

163
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
That India is the place which has the roots

164
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,960
and we are  offshoots, no doubt about it.

165
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,800
Sahaja Yogi: They don’t understand at what level they are.

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,760
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is true. India is not all cult, is not all cult.

167
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,360
There are real people and there are unreal people.

168
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,600
And the unreal people are in the market.

169
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,080
Mataji is not in the market, She is a temple in the market.

170
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,560
This is the difference.

171
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,520
She is not in the market, She is selling nothing.

172
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,440
You see?

173
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,960
But, she, the temple had to be established in the market

174
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,200
because in the market people were looking in the name of God.

175
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,960
So she is the only guru who has come,

176
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,320
who is a real person, who is a realized person,

177
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,480
who is not a cult person, but has come

178
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,400
to the market

179
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,400
and is the temple,

180
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,840
which is a more difficult thing.

181
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,360
And you can say, “We have seen, actually with our own eyes the Kundalini rising.

182
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,120
We have seen people being cured of Sahaja Yoga,

183
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,320
getting out of the hospitals, how are we not to believe in?”

184
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,640
By Sahaja Yogis!

185
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,720
Christine has cured one blood cancer now.

186
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,920
They are very confident.

187
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,680
Not that only I have cured,

188
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,520
but Christine has cured now, Christine and What’s his name, another one?

189
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,720
They, they have cured it, so you cannot just say -

190
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,880
Herman.

191
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,560
But you can also cure.

192
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,840
“So this is not a cult.

193
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,520
Our health has improved.

194
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,240
We have given up all old habits, alcoholism automatically;

195
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,160
we are saving money, about every way we are better off.

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,760
In the cult this doesn’t happen,

197
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,680
only you start behaving in a funny manner, everybody is becoming strange.

198
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,440
We are very normal people, we are not strange. On the contrary

199
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,360
we have drop out all our strangeness.

200
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,400
Cult is a strange thing.”

201
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,600
But if you walk anywhere you will not be called strange at all,

202
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,160
on the contrary, you’ll be called very healthy and happy people.

203
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,440
We went to one, one, one

204
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,280
shop in Italy.

205
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,040
The lady of a very big shop, you see?

206
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,200
As soon as she saw, she said, “Ha, ha, come along.”

207
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,360
Yes, she did not know what was happening to her.

208
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,240
“Ha, please come in. Oh, come along. Very happy. Come along.”

209
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,560
She didn’t know what has happening to her, you see,

210
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,680
the way she was expressing herself, so funny.

211
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,360
And then, in France this happened,

212
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,720
and then we went to another shop.

213
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,120
They said, “You people look so very happy,

214
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,560
very happy, relaxed people. So who are you?”

215
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,600
And one man who saw Me at the airport, you see,

216
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,040
he was from Congo,

217
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,560
and he just followed Me.

218
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,440
There were three, four others who followed Me, and they came to the airport.

219
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,360
We were sitting at the airport and

220
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,440
he asked them - he is from the Ministry of Industries from Congo

221
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,600
and he asked, “Who is this lady?” “She looks so serene

222
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,920
and you people look so happy,

223
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,560
what is all this going on?”

224
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,600
And now, then he went to the ashram; now he is going to take it to Congo.

225
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,440
So you must say, “Either you are seekers or you are not.

226
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,400
If you are, you must seek it, as we have sought.

227
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,000
We went through all these nonsensical things.

228
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,680
We have just to come to tell you because you should not be lost.”

229
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,920
Yes?

230
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,680
Sahaja Yogi: I still see divine light people the other day, Mother,

231
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,200
and I was talking to them

232
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,880
about what You keep on saying about the experiences

233
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,280
Shri Mataji: I can’t hear.

234
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,800
Sahaja Yogi: I was talking to them, right.

235
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,360
I’m trying to sort of getting them to come to the pavilion, right, and

236
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,320
Sahaja Yogini: Speak of Richard, Mother.

237
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,640
Sahaja Yogi:I was trying to expose the meeting, Mother.

238
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,880
Shri Mataji: Yes, I know. Sahaja Yogi: And they said something like

239
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,960
“Oh well, we’ve heard all these stories about how, you know,

240
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,960
people have blockages in their chakras and they start to shake and that.

241
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,720
How do you know what’s happening in all this sort of thing?”

242
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,600
Could you give us some sort of good, rational

243
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,200
counterarguments against that?

244
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,160
Because they are so obviously into their guru that they think that theirs is right and

245
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,200
if you feel pains in the chakras they said is because you’re all blocked

246
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,080
and not them, you know?

247
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,120
Shri Mataji: It’s very simple. You give yourself a bandhan and you can discriminate.

248
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,680
If you just give yourself a bandhan then you can discriminate.

249
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,960
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, but to that, to satisfy their minds, you know

250
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,560
Shri Mataji: No, it should be clear-cut to you also, isn’t it?

251
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,960
So, if you give yourself a bandhan, you can make it out.

252
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

253
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Shri Mataji: You can go and talk to them.

254
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
You should say, “In any case, you come and listen to Mother;

255
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,640
She’ll tell you if you have any problem.

256
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,240
We may be not so good as yet, maybe.

257
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,720
But we definitely feel.

258
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,840
We have to still learn because we have to become

259
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,520
and know all the technique.”

260
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,640
So, that’s what you should accept a situation

261
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,320
may be that we do not know.

262
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,880
Just you give yourself a bandhan and you’ll know.

263
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,920
And afterwards you don’t have to do that also, immediately you know

264
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,520
what is yours and what is theirs.

265
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,480
Why are you not going and talk to them?

266
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,800
You take one or two people from here, again.

267
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,120
Suburb and London people can go, senior people can go and say.

268
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,440
Oh, but none of them have come here from

269
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,520
Gavin, all these people, anybody.

270
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,400
You can go and talk, all of you are quite senior that way.

271
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,320
You can tell them that you can put yourself into chakras, you can fell it.

272
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,360
All right?

273
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,280
If there are three, four people then if one

274
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,800
is too much, you see, because they are negative people.

275
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,920
So they try to, sort of put you down.

276
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,080
But if there is one person is like that,

277
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,200
another person can stand up and say, “This is this.”

278
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,880
Another can say, “This is this.”

279
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
That’s how.

280
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,200
But there should be no quarreling among Sahaja Yogis there.

281
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,800
That’s important.

282
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,960
Otherwise it would be ridiculous.

283
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,240
But that’s how it will be, that you can make out.

284
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,080
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, You also focus in Your attention on the front person, aren’t You?

285
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,240
By putting the attention, and then if you catch

286
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,240
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s right.

287
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,840
My attention is there on Brighton, no doubt, but what I’m saying that,

288
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,880
you see, you are the channels now. You have to do the job.

289
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,080
You see, I am the source but you have to be the channels.

290
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,840
Channels have to be all right.

291
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,080
Say for example ...

292
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,920
Look at this.

293
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,680
Truth is what you -[use]

294
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,520
is your great

295
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,600
Brighton.

296
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,240
Mhmm, now better.

297
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,520
Better now?

298
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,640
Mhmm? How is it?

299
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,680
And when they ask you such questions also, you should say,

300
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,080
“But you can’t even see those blocks, anything; you cannot see anything.”

301
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,440
You should say, “You have not even seen with your naked eyes

302
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,440
the Kundalini rising, nothing. We have seen it!”

303
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,600
At least you see you are progressing.

304
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,120
“Maybe the knowledge may not be complete,

305
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,960
but we are seeing that.

306
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,160
It’s actualization, is not just talking, you know?”

307
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,640
If you take three, four people is always better in an argument.

308
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,600
You should say, “Look, you want to achieve it or not?

309
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,120
You don’t have to pay anything.

310
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,720
Nothing to be surrendered, nothing.

311
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,360
Just you have to come and see for yourself.

312
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,280
After all, what is She going to gain out of you?

313
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,920
We have to gain out of Her.

314
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,680
So why not?”

315
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,920
Better.

316
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,720
You have to tell them about the concern that you have.

317
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,480
You should say that, “You are not going to get it.

318
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760
That’s not the way.

319
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,720
You are not manifesting any of your powers.”

320
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,120
If we are -

321
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,240
technically all right, one person can be all right, technically

322
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,840
who understands the technique, the divine technique

323
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,160
another who can argue it out, another one who can talk about

324
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,760
other gurus, and things like that, three, four people.

325
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,440
You must all have a proper training center, I think for this.

326
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,320
Sit down, talk, talk,

327
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,560
find out how to propagate, how to talk.

328
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,560
All these things you have to do.

329
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,320
You see, like Warren has done that and it has worked out wonders.

330
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,640
But you see, Warren himself got into it

331
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,760
too much and he really learned it.

332
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,640
Just go on into it,

333
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,560
find out what is what, what is what, what is what.

334
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,560
That’s how he can do it much better.

335
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,000
Got all Sahaja yoga books, this, that, everything.

336
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,160
And worked it out, found out this, that,

337
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,160
every kind of a combination and these things.

338
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,600
And then also, when you start doing that, you get the knowledge.

339
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,360
The Advent, our Gregoire has written, and I asked him,

340
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,400
“How did you get all these quotations?” He said, “I just got it.

341
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,920
When I was writing, they just came to me

342
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,560
either I read it in the book or in a newspaper,

343
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,240
suddenly at that moment only I got it.”

344
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,720
So that’s how the knowledge comes to you.

345
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,800
Like today only

346
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,760
I bought a nightdress from Shonu or something,

347
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,320
so Rustom said,” Mother, you never wear”.

348
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,560
I said, “No, I don’t. I wear sari.”

349
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,440
He said, “I know because the Devi is not supposed to sleep in the nightdress”.

350
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,760
Devi, you see?

351
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,040
Twenty four hours I am on duty.

352
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,920
When should I undress Myself?

353
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,080
It’s correct.

354
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,880
He told Me this, that, “How can a goddess be undressed in the night?

355
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,920
Because she has no night and she has no day.”

356
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,320
The way he has studied it is really remarkable, you see?

357
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,640
The way he has studied all the names of the goddess, the meanings and all that, you see.

358
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,040
Gives you such tremendous strength,

359
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,840
and the identification with that.

360
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,680
He said, “How can the goddess retire?

361
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,840
She has no retirement.

362
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,120
When she sleeps, she’s working harder, still.”

363
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,480
Is a fact.

364
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,040
And all this understanding comes

365
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,840
by identifying

366
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,800
yourself with the creator.

367
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,840
Because superficially it looks odd that I should sleep in a sari on, you are right..

368
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,800
But if you fix one point, that whatever Mother does is a divine thing,

369
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,960
then everything starts revealing to you, why She does it.

370
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,560
Now this thing like Coca Cola.

371
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,440
I, I, first I never used to take it.

372
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,000
Now, there’s something gone better out of it,

373
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,080
something has been removed from that Coca Cola,

374
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,960
which was wrong there, now I  can take it.

375
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,080
Never used to drink any Coca Cola.

376
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,640
In small things, in big things, you can see

377
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,000
today you see, at one point only I said,

378
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,240
“I think you are going in a wrong direction.”

379
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,680
On one point only I said.

380
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,640
Of course I told him by what way to go and all that.

381
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,680
But just one, and that was the point he made a mistake.

382
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,640
Many things I have to do.

383
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,360
I have to manage this big stuff, you know?

384
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,880
It’s a very difficult task.

385
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,320
To be a human being is the most difficult task I say.

386
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,800
But I am managing it quite all right

387
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,840
and you should use that.

388
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,480
You should use that to camouflage Me, in the beginning; very much.

389
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,320
You should say: “Just like us, She is absolutely human.

390
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,640
She drinks tea,

391
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,920
She sits with us,

392
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,280
She talks to us.

393
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,040
It’s nothing like that,

394
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,440
and we know what we are doing, every word.

395
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,360
In only a cult you become fanatic and you don’t know what you are doing.

396
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,800
It’s not like that. We know everything.

397
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,280
We know how people are mesmerized.

398
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,640
We know what chakras are, We know everything about it.

399
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,240
Cult is ignorance.

400
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,960
This is knowledge.”

401
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,880
“And we don’t want you to be unfortunate people”.

402
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,320
We don’t want you to reign

403
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,040
yourself in

404
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,920
complete terror

405
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,520
and to be under the reign of terror and agony

406
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,880
and frustration

407
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,320
You should ask the people who were there for twelve years, thirteen years, all these movements,

408
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,720
“Where are they?”

409
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,120
“What has happened?” They are only in Sahaja Yoga.

410
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,720
Most of those senior people of all these gurus are in Sahaja Yoga.

411
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,840
Charismatic movement.

412
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,600
You should have seen the charismatic, bapre!

413
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,920
The fellow went into ...

414
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,080
You were not there?

415
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,800
Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know.

416
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,600
Shri Mataji: In France, they went into a big

417
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,360
we’ve never seen such an epilepsy. For how much time, do you know?

418
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,320
Sahaja Yogi: Long. Sahaja Yogi: More than half of an hour I think.

419
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
Shri Mataji: At least half an hour.

420
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,760
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. It’s crying, and

421
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,360
sick and everything.

422
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,560
Shri Mataji: And apart from that the whole body was shaking.

423
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,720
Sahaja Yogi: In total convulsions.

424
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,160
Shri Mataji: And he got cured. I just yield to him, “You get up now.”

425
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,400
Hello.

426
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,960
Is Jason here?

427
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,720
Yes.

428
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,640
Oh, good.

429
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,960
Hello, Jeremy. How are you? Good?

430
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,960
Daisies and daisies, these days. Just see.

431
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,040
I’ve never seen a daisy like this before.

432
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,560
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, can you take?

433
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,680
Shri Mataji: What a color!

434
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,600
And here the Sahasrara is very strong, do you see that?

435
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,240
Sahaja Yogi: Beautiful is that.

436
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,920
Shri Mataji: And daisies are very fragrant these days, very fragrant.

437
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,600
Child: Nanny’s name is Daisy.

438
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,480
Shri Mataji: Hmm, that’s why.

439
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,680
They all know.

440
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,240
The daisies have the greatest variety now, I think.

441
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,680
I’m going to see in the ...

442
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,040
I don’t know, when are they going to have that

443
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
Chelsea Flower Show. Next week?

444
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,960
Next month?

445
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,440
A week or I don’t know when?

446
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,520
Sahaja Yogini: It’s in May.

447
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,320
Sahaja Yogi: Very soon.

448
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,280
Very soon, Mother. This month.

449
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,440
Shri Mataji: They were building up all these things, today we saw.

450
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,800
But maybe next week, maybe.

451
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,120
You should say, “These arguments have no meaning,

452
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,200
doesn’t give you any strength.

453
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,040
Don’t be misled. It’s not good.

454
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,720
You see, you can brand anybody as cult, but what you will get out of it, you see?

455
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,840
There is no money, there is no organization, there is no membership.

456
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,880
How can it be a cult? And we are very normal people.

457
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,160
We are not strange.

458
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,840
First thing is they should be strange people doing something strange.

459
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,480
We don’t do anything strange.”

460
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,240
They might say that you move your hands and things.

461
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,320
You should say that, “When the power starts flowing from our hand,

462
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,720
we have to use our hands; we can feel the power flowing”.

463
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,440
All right?

464
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,240
When did you go? To see whom?

465
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,840
Sahaja Yogi: (If I might,) I just saw them, I didn’t go to see them. I just has happened to see them.

466
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,040
I didn’t go to see them, Mother. They just happened to be there,

467
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,160
at the time I’ve just was passing,

468
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,920
at the same time as they were.

469
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,080
So we got into sort of natural talk, you know.

470
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,040
Shri Mataji: You go, go and talk to that fellow, who is well known

471
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,040
or whatever is his. What is his name?

472
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,800
Sahaja Yogi: I’ve been working on him, Mother. Talking with him a few times.

473
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,240
His name, his name is John Noyce, Mother.

474
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,680
His name is John Noyce, Mother. And ...

475
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,840
Shri Mataji: (Let him,) let Phil and all these people go and see him.

476
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,600
Sahaja Yogi: Yes

477
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,320
Shri Mataji: Good idea.

478
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,280
Nick is there, anyone feels is normal.

479
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Take three, four people and you talk.

480
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,320
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

481
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,040
Shri Mataji: Danny is there. Now, anyone.

482
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,640
And need not be people from, say, from Brighton.

483
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,760
If you are from the same place nobody has any respect for you.

484
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,560
You should take people from ...

485
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,560
These are all human psychologies. You must work it out.

486
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,880
I think I should sleep now, 11:30. All right?

487
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,200
"See, if you have the caliber you’ll get through, you’ll see.

488
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,960
Not the heart. If you say that, you’ll hurt them. But it’s a caliber, you see.

489
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,400
“That’s true, but one has to have that caliber, of a seeking.

490
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,480
If you are superficial seekers, then it’s rather difficult I think, it’s better.

491
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,400
But if you are deeply seeking, than it works out, no doubt.

492
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,000
We have seen that.”

493
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,400
You cannot say you, but you should say,

494
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,600
“We have seen some people, you see, who are very superficial type.

495
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,720
They really do not stick on, they just get out.

496
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,560
But we have some people of very high caliber.

497
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,720
They just come into it and they have the pattern, they just fit into it like that.

498
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,040
It’s a fact.

499
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,760
We are not telling lies, you see?”

500
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,560
But this will put up their challenges and they will be better off.

501
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,160
All right, so if you don’t mind

502
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,560
I wanted to have a bath; now I’ll have it tomorrow morning.

503
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,960
I was saying that

504
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,280
tomorrow morning these children would like to go to the

505
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,800
children’s this thing or something?

506
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,800
Sahaja Yogi: Very good, Mother.

507
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,720
Shri Mataji: I told her. She, she took so much interest in Me, suddenly.

508
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,480
We were on the same table, she was just facing me

509
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,320
and there were other eight people all together, small table.

510
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,880
But she took so much interest in Me, I don’t know why.

511
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,360
She asked me several questions, different, different, so many questions she asked me.

512
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,080
And one of them was -

513
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,800
She asked -

514
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,440
I told her we were very happy,

515
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,480
Indians were very happy when you said nice things about the Indians settled here.

516
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,800
“Oh, I mean it, I mean it.

517
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,480
They’re very spiritual endowed people, you see.

518
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,600
How we live our life we have made a mess of our lives

519
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,000
they are sensible, their children are educated, they are very solid people

520
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,040
and they have, they have lot of -

521
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,440
they have given a lot of contribution

522
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,800
to the growth of this country”, she said.

523
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,880
So she said, “How do they manage this spiritual side, you know?”

524
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,280
I said, “It’s like a,

525
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,120
your developing is that of the shoot I think,

526
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,600
and we are on the root’s side perhaps”.

527
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,520
“Oh, must be that.”

528
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,480
And then she has asked another question to them,

529
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,160
“I’ve seen people who are academically very good, you know.

530
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,440
They, I don’t know, they get western sometimes.

531
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,800
I don’t know what happens to them.

532
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,200
They are very good as individuals, they do very well.

533
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,200
They’re individualistic

534
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,280
but what happens to them later on, I don’t know in life.

535
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,840
So she asked them, “They say, there is somebody saying”
