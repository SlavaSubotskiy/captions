1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:15,710
Today we are worshipping Adi Shakti.

2
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:24,830
I think this is the most important puja

3
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:34,030
because it is the power of Adi Shakti

4
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,110
that has given you Self Realisation,

5
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,990
that has given you the Truth,

6
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,110
that has given you the power of compassion and love.

7
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:10,190
That's the power that separated from Sadashiva

8
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:30,430
and this power wanted Herself to create this complete universe.

9
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:40,870
Universes after universes, She's creating and loving.

10
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:49,310
With Her love, She did this great creation,

11
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,830
creation of this world also.

12
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:01,430
This is a specially selected planet,

13
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,190
which was very beautifully brought in the centre

14
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,790
between the sun and the moon

15
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:21,150
for the creation of, ultimately, the human beings.

16
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:34,470
This is Her great work with such love and affection

17
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,430
and with very great hope

18
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:47,630
that Her children will know the truth

19
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,470
and will get the ultimate knowledge about themselves

20
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,750
and about everything else.

21
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,270
As you have read in the Bible

22
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:14,070
about how Adi Shakti came in the form of a snake

23
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,430
and told human beings

24
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:26,510
that you have to know the knowledge,

25
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:32,870
Adam and Eve, and to Eve specially,

26
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:39,710
and they accepted to eat the fruit of knowledge

27
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,700
because they would have remained just like animals,

28
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,660
without knowing anything subtleties of life —

29
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,420
little higher animals maybe  —

30
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:03,940
that once they ate the fruit they started feeling

31
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,860
that there is something wrong the

32
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,980
way they are without any clothes,

33
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,500
so they brought some leaves of the tree

34
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,100
and covered themselves.

35
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:28,500
So the first knowledge came was of chastity

36
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,860
because Shri Ganesha was established

37
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:43,020
and His influence brought forth this consciousness

38
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,100
that we have to cover our bodies.

39
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,660
We are no more animals.

40
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,780
Only the animals

41
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,620
— of course, they're not standing, so it is all right —

42
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,780
are not aware of it.

43
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,740
With the knowledge of chastity,

44
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,060
gradually human beings started growing

45
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,780
into beautiful nations,

46
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:26,060
but there are so many things,  which were still to be known,

47
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,460
to be aware of it.

48
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:39,140
You may be aware of many things,

49
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:52,580
but unless and until you get your spiritual awakening,

50
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,220
unless and until you get your self knowledge,

51
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,700
all other knowledge is absolutely nothing.

52
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,420
With this self knowledge only, you become powerful.

53
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:22,140
The real power — the real power is of love and compassion.

54
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:33,620
Today when you see the whole world is busy fighting

55
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,460
and they are trying to protect people

56
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,380
from wars and creating

57
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:53,020
great, huge, protecting instruments.

58
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,260
The whole world seems to be in a mad race

59
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:05,340
of killing each other, of destroying each other,

60
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:14,460
of competition, ambition,

61
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,980
leading to fighting and then to greater wars.

62
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,820
They're fighting for a piece of land.

63
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,140
So ignorant they are.

64
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:38,980
Can you carry even a pinch of this land with you

65
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,780
when you die?

66
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,020
When you are born you come with closed fists.

67
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,220
When you die you go with open hands.

68
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,380
What do you take with you?

69
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,340
All right, you may not like to take anything,

70
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,740
but do you enjoy whatever you think is so great

71
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,180
for which you are fighting?

72
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:17,740
Why this fighting going on among all nonsensical people?

73
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:27,900
It's surprising how people give up their peace,

74
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,140
give up their understanding

75
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,900
when it comes to a piece of land.

76
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,740
And the whole thing has moved into a very wrong direction

77
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:53,180
and going towards complete destruction.

78
00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:04,100
The thing that has made human beings so much suffering

79
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:12,220
because of all their ignorance,

80
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:18,660
by which they have all those habits,

81
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,500
all those attractions,

82
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:29,260
all those identification, which is ruinous,

83
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:36,980
which will ruin all of them, each one by one.

84
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,580
They have to take to sense

85
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:49,020
and they have to take to their self knowledge.

86
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:57,660
Self knowledge is the key

87
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:05,940
for a saviour to give to people.

88
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,620
We have had so many saints.

89
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,900
We have had so many Sufis.

90
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:20,620
We had Tao people. We had Zen people.

91
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:26,860
All kinds of realised souls came on this Earth.

92
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:33,820
They all suffered. They were tortured. Nobody understood them.

93
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:42,820
But now the time has come for you to know the truth,

94
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:49,860
but truth which is not dry, truth which has compassion,

95
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,020
truth that encompasses everyone,

96
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:02,380
that brings the complete view of our existence.

97
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:09,020
Why are we here on this Earth? What is our purpose?

98
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,140
What should we do? Adi Shakti's

99
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,540
powers are such

100
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,300
of love and compassion,

101
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:26,660
that makes you understand your self first.

102
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:34,100
The love, for you, is very, very limited.

103
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:41,780
There's no awareness of your own being.

104
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,900
Just imagine what a great task is for you,

105
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:53,060
how much you have to be seriously

106
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,900
becoming aware of your self first.

107
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,700
That is extremely important.

108
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,980
First you have to be aware of your self.

109
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,340
And now you have the light of your spirit.

110
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,260
In the light of that spirit you can see what you are

111
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,060
and you can see how far you are going,

112
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,860
how wrong things you are doing,

113
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,380
what harm you are doing to yourself

114
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,900
and you have a power to cure it,

115
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,260
to improve it and to come to your senses.

116
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,820
These are the most important times.

117
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,140
You will never get these times again.

118
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:56,100
Never had it in the history and you can never get it in the future.

119
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:04,020
This is the time you have got, not only the awareness,

120
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,260
not only the self knowledge,

121
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,460
but you know how to do it.

122
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,980
Otherwise, about the saints,

123
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,660
about those people, Tao and Zen people,

124
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,500
they have just described

125
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:30,420
what a person with self knowledge is,

126
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,620
how he behaves, how his style is,

127
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,780
how he's so different from others.

128
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,980
But none of them have said how you become that.

129
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,620
No one has been able to say that.

130
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,780
Nobody has been able to do that also

131
00:13:52,940 --> 00:14:01,380
because perhaps most of them didn't know about kundalini

132
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:08,740
and those who knew also could not talk about it to people.

133
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,980
So the greatest work of the Adi Shakti is

134
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:24,420
to put the kundalini  in your sacrum bone.

135
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:32,940
This kundalini is not the Adi Shakti.

136
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,660
The Adi Shakti is a much greater thing, a much bigger thing,

137
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:42,140
much wider thing, much deeper, much stronger,

138
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,580
much stronger, much more powerful.

139
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:53,420
Kundalini is the reflection of Adi Shakti power

140
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:00,860
and when She rises you know what happens to you

141
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:07,100
and how you get your Realisation.

142
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,060
But you have to be very watchful.

143
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,060
Are you really a compassionate person?

144
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,620
If you are compassionate,

145
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,300
the first thing that will happen to any compassionate person,

146
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:32,180
I think, will be to help others,

147
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,100
to emancipate others.

148
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:41,580
They cannot be satisfied with their own achievements

149
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:50,780
and with their own state of Self Realisation.

150
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,380
It cannot happen.

151
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,860
What was the need for the Adi Shakti to do all, all these efforts

152
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,700
to work so hard?

153
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,860
You know that, that I had to work very, very hard,

154
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,500
but, from my very childhood

155
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,060
I've worked very hard

156
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,500
and I've gone through very difficult times,

157
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:26,540
very, very difficult times according to human understanding,

158
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,700
but the worst time I have, when I see

159
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,100
those people whom I have given Realisation,

160
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,220
those who are self-realised people,

161
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:49,020
they are the ones who have no responsibility for others

162
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,060
and, if they have, it is very little.

163
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,380
They don't have that compassion

164
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,420
and don't have that love

165
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,260
that we have to today save the world,

166
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,660
save the humanity.

167
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:12,060
That's our — not only our principal work,

168
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,060
but the only work that we have to do.

169
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,580
All other things are going to achieve nothing,

170
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,500
except for your own efforts here,

171
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,340
individual efforts

172
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,820
to give Self Realisation to others

173
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,820
and give them this knowledge.

174
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:44,860
This knowledge is so, so easy to understand.

175
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,500
It is very subtle, no doubt,

176
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,420
and, as I've told you,

177
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:57,780
that the quantum theory they're talking about now, the scientists,

178
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,860
is that they have seen those miraculous waves of lights

179
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,140
and they are trying to find out something about it.

180
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:16,340
It cannot be that some Sahaja Yogis will rise above others.

181
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:23,620
Every one of you [has] to know that this is a very special thing

182
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,860
that has happened to you.

183
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,580
Even if you had gone to Himalayas,

184
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,300
even if you have starved yourself,

185
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,780
even if you have been singing the praise of God for years,

186
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:45,660
even   you had done all kinds of rituals and penances,

187
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,620
you could not have got your Realisation.

188
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,220
That would not have been possible.

189
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:57,860
I knew this. That's why I have to work very hard,

190
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,620
facing all kinds of problems, all kinds of turmoils,

191
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,180
all kinds of pressures, what was the thing?

192
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:16,180
Just to see that you all are created

193
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,460
and you're all My hands.

194
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:25,420
You have to work. Every finger has to work.

195
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,420
And that is what I have been telling you,

196
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:35,940
that now it is our responsibility to see that we become,

197
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:43,100
not only Sahaja Yogis ourself, but blossoming time

198
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,060
and many, many Sahaja Yogis we should have.

199
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:55,340
It's a work of Adi Shakti.

200
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,220
Try to understand this.

201
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,180
It's not work of any saint.

202
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,940
It's not work of any incarnation.

203
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,980
It's not work of any politician.

204
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:17,420
And not work of any big leader.

205
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,620
It is the work of Adi Shakti,

206
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:28,980
which is so transparently showing its results in you.

207
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:35,020
Now it is for you to see.

208
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:43,420
To please Me is your ardent desire, I know.

209
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:53,100
I see how you love Me and how you want to do for Me.

210
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,180
The greatest thing you can do for Me

211
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,620
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

212
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:09,860
It is a very special, extremely difficult blessings you have got.

213
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,060
You didn't have to do any efforts.

214
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,300
You didn't have to pay any money.

215
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:29,220
You don't have to get sick with rituals.

216
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,420
You got it spontaneously.

217
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,980
But that doesn't mean that it's sort of your birthright to get it.

218
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,180
[It] is the work of Adi Shakti.

219
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:56,420
And the work of Adi Shakti has to be shown in your life.

220
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:06,460
[It] is the compassion, without any reward.

221
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,540
People have tried to spread their religion

222
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,380
by showing compassion to poor people,

223
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,500
looking after the poor people, handicapped people.

224
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:27,100
There's no need, actually, for Sahaja Yogis to do that.

225
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,420
What they have to do is to transform other people.

226
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,860
Find out ways and methods how you can transform,

227
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,820
how you can spread the message of Adi Shakti.

228
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,460
Put your mind to it

229
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,140
and you will know how you can manage it.

230
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:01,700
There should be all the time compelling desire

231
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,700
that we have to find out method

232
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,660
by which we can spread Sahaja Yoga.

233
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:15,860
Otherwise it's like what Christ has described

234
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:22,980
that some seed fell on the marshy land

235
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:29,460
and they sprouted, but never grew.

236
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:36,900
You can only grow in the real sense of the word

237
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:43,820
and become something very, very special and real

238
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:50,780
by knowing what you can do.

239
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,020
I have a vision, no doubt,

240
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,380
and I've been talking about it quite a lot,

241
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:06,020
but it ends up with the puja is not a good thing.

242
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,060
I know some countries are very difficult.

243
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,300
Try to find out what is the problem,

244
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,420
why it is so very difficult.

245
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,660
Attention has to be paid to this,

246
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:34,420
that what other human beings are doing to destroy themselves,

247
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,100
as if it is the part and parcel of the same game

248
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,020
which we call as the last judgement,

249
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,860
but let us, through our compassion and love,

250
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,980
save as many as possible.

251
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,500
This is the work of Adi Shakti,

252
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,900
not the work of any saint or any incarnation.

253
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,660
They're all there, no doubt.

254
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,740
They're all with us, all the time to help us,

255
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,500
but you people have the power of Adi Shakti,

256
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,340
which is very great,

257
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,300
which is very penetrating,

258
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,500
which is miraculous.

259
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,940
It's so effective,

260
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:35,060
but unless and until you become aware of your own powers,

261
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,220
how will you work it out.

262
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:43,780
It would be like a dead machine that has everything,

263
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,140
but nobody is there to work it out.

264
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:55,180
All the time I had to go through very,

265
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,260
very hazardous times

266
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:05,180
and sometimes I felt that I may have to take another birth,

267
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,260
the way things are so difficult for Me.

268
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:15,900
But now, for you, it has been very easy,

269
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:22,020
as if the one who makes the road has to work very hard,

270
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,620
but those who walk on that,

271
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,940
they don't realise how easily they have got it.

272
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:36,380
And if they realise this, then they will realise also

273
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,540
'Let many walk on this road,

274
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,220
which was created with such

275
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,500
patience, understanding and love.'

276
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:53,260
I have to really see you all Sahaja Yogis

277
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:58,900
doing your level best to change this world

278
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,060
— has to be changed.

279
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,980
As it is, humanity has to be saved

280
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,860
through you and nobody else.

281
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,620
No president, no prime minister,

282
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,060
no minister,

283
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,020
none of these people can change the world

284
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,940
and save it.

285
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,020
It is you who are entitled.

286
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,620
You have got this power.

287
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:34,580
Do you realise your own status?

288
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,380
Your own being?

289
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,100
which has risen so high?

290
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:49,140
It is not there. If that realisation is there,

291
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,140
you would go all out

292
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:00,260
to express your love and compassion to other people,

293
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,660
to make them realise what they are.

294
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,900
Only with Sahaja Yoga you can save this world.

295
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,340
There's no other way out.

296
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:18,220
Whatever you may try, say, to help the poor, to help this and that

297
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,820
is something very, very superficial.

298
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:31,100
Best thing is to give Realisation to every person you see.

299
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,660
We have seen children. They're coming up.

300
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,500
They'll be great Sahaja Yogis also. I can see that.

301
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:47,740
But before them, you have to show your own merits

302
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,780
of what you have done.

303
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,860
It's not a static work.

304
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:00,420
It's a big movement, which has to be really explosive

305
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:09,940
and unless and until such a great step is taken,

306
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:22,940
I don't know who will be blamed for the doomsday.

307
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:30,300
You are the one[s] who have to build up

308
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,060
the destiny of human beings.

309
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,940
Don't consider as yourself, as something nothing.

310
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,580
You could never have got your Realisation.

311
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,820
You'd never have come to Me.

312
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,300
Among so many, you are the ones who came to Me

313
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,580
and who asked for Realisation and got it.

314
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,660
You know it cannot be forced.

315
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,460
This Realisation cannot be forced.

316
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,780
This awareness cannot be forced.

317
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:09,980
And the growthof this awareness also cannot be forced.

318
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:16,540
You have to develop that attention deep down within yourself.

319
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,140
And see for yourself what you have done,

320
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,460
what you have done.

321
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:29,860
If you are still busy with the money problem or the power problem

322
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,420
and this problem and that, you are a problem.

323
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,980
You are not a Sahaja Yogi.

324
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,180
Sahaja Yogi is above everything else

325
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,940
and is very powerful.

326
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,660
Power will be achieved by them

327
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,500
— power of love and compassion,

328
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,900
which is not only words of love.

329
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:02,660
It is not only act of loving others,

330
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:12,020
but it is a powerful personality that you will have,

331
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,620
which will just emit

332
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:26,100
that great Divine Light and can capture people.

333
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:37,740
All should just take a very brave personality.

334
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,820
I must say people have improved,

335
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,100
otherwise everybody used to write to Me:

336
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,420
'This is wrong with me and that is wrong with my father.

337
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,980
That is wrong with my great-grandmother' and all kinds of things.

338
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:59,780
That is over now. Much less, I must say, much less.

339
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:07,620
But instead of telling Me about people who are sick,

340
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,140
people who have failed,

341
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:19,100
people who are still in a state

342
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:26,380
that cannot be improved, attention should be changed.

343
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:32,660
If there's one person who has got cancer anywhere,

344
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,900
immediately at least ten photographs will come to Me.

345
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,500
Leader will write to Me. The wife's leader will write to Me.

346
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:46,580
Everybody will write to Me that Mother, say such-and-such thing.

347
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:55,220
Why? Is that My job?

348
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,580
That person can be cured — we have hospitals —

349
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,020
can be cured by photographs,

350
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:08,340
but attention always goes now to compassion part.

351
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,900
To those people who are so-called suffering physically,

352
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:18,660
mentally, emotionally, financially,

353
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,740
also in the marriages,

354
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,740
that's not your job,

355
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,700
neither Mine.

356
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,020
If they're sick, they should take a photograph and work it out.

357
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,620
If it doesn't work, that means that it doesn't deserve.

358
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:49,460
There is no need for you to treat them and to work it out and,

359
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,500
if it fails, to write to Me

360
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,100
that 'Mother, such-and-such person is sick.'

361
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,140
What's so important?

362
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:05,980
Already we have so many healthy people going round.

363
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,340
Why not use them first?

364
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,660
Our job is not to cure people.

365
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:17,700
Affection is all right. Compassion is all right. Is a natural thing

366
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:24,580
that our attention goes to sick people or to the poor people

367
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:29,220
or to the people who are suffering,

368
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:34,660
but what about Sahaj Yog?

369
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,300
If you have one sick person,

370
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,580
hundred Sahaja Yogis will get after that.

371
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,980
What is the reason?

372
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:53,060
Is it compassion?

373
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,420
It's not.

374
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:03,700
They want to prove that they can cure that person.

375
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,580
Is not compassion.

376
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,020
Compassion today is

377
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:17,540
to transform human beings into Sahajis,

378
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,340
into good people.

379
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,580
That is the love of Adi Shakti.

380
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,820
Because those who are born have to die in any case.

381
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,140
We should not be unkind, of course, but

382
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:40,620
our attention should be how many people we are giving Realisation.

383
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,020
Is a very common thing

384
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,780
that people indulge more into so-called curing

385
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:55,500
and improving and this. It's all right.

386
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:01,060
Also there are problems like in the marriages, you see.

387
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,500
Some marriage couple don't want to be there.

388
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,100
It's all right. Finish them.

389
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,220
If they don't want to live together, let them.

390
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,660
We have many people who are sensible in this world,

391
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,620
many people who are healthy in this world.

392
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,140
Now how can you go on struggling with people

393
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,180
who don't want to live together and have problems?

394
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,460
That's not your job.

395
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,700
First of all, you are a spiritual worker.

396
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,020
You are not a social worker.

397
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,740
Of course,

398
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:46,260
by the way, you can do social work. It doesn't matter, by the way.

399
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:54,020
But the main thing for you is to transform human beings.

400
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:59,460
With that, the greatest disease

401
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:05,300
is of meanness, of cruelty,

402
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:13,420
of torturing others, anger.

403
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:18,100
All these diseases can be cured,

404
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,300
which are internal, not external.

405
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,020
That is today wanted.

406
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,180
Every country's fighting and is tortured

407
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:36,500
and is in peril all the time of getting destroyed.

408
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:42,780
The only way you can do it is to give them Realisation.

409
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,540
Now what happens is to be seen very clearly

410
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:53,780
that when you give Realisation to someone

411
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:59,460
and he values it, and he grows into it,

412
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,140
then you are protected.

413
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,140
You are completely protected.

414
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,500
Who protects you, you may say?

415
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,580
The Adi Shakti, all right,

416
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:23,380
but also there is a destructive power working in this world,

417
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:30,220
not of negativity, but positive destructive power of Shiva.

418
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:42,300
If He says that if Adi Shakti's work is going on well, He's happy.

419
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:46,340
But He's sitting there and watching each and every person,

420
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,180
each and every work of Sahaja Yogis

421
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:58,660
and if He finds something really very wrong,

422
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,420
I cannot control it.

423
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:09,180
He destroys. I cannot go to that point.

424
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,980
He destroys.

425
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:20,860
Not only destroys, but thousands He can destroy.

426
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,460
Anywhere there is a calamity,

427
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:35,620
we can say, like an earthquake

428
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:40,300
or some sort of a hurricane,

429
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,300
all these things come

430
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:50,340
through the working of Shri Mahadeva.

431
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,940
I can't help you there,

432
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,780
but if you really give Realisation to people,

433
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,140
all these can be averted.

434
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:13,100
Of course, it is the whim, I should say, of Adi Shakti

435
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,660
that She started this work of creating this world,

436
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,980
of creating you and making you Sahaja Yogis,

437
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:27,500
but your responsibility is also very important.

438
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:34,380
You cannot be responsible.

439
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:47,100
Maybe it was, I felt, My responsibility, but there's a difference.

440
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,300
I never felt it was My responsibility,

441
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,260
never felt this was My job,

442
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,500
never felt I have to do it.

443
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,140
'I did it.'

444
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,460
That is the work.

445
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,900
That's the kind of personality you should have.

446
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:19,940
You have to do it in a very humble manner,

447
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,580
in a very beautiful manner

448
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:31,900
and you'll be amazed to see how you are protected,

449
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:38,580
how you are supported and how everything works out.

450
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,460
The greatest joy you will get when you will find

451
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,700
you can give Realisation to people.

452
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,940
You can change their lives.

453
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,940
Never you would feel such joy,

454
00:41:54,100 --> 00:42:02,060
even if you get, say, a big lottery maybe,

455
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:06,500
a big job or a big name

456
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:13,100
or a very big award, no.

457
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:19,260
The joy of creating Sahaja Yogis

458
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,940
knows no bounds,

459
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,420
is such a joy-giving thing.

460
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,500
You develop such fraternities,

461
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:41,700
such solidarity, as they call it, such oneness,

462
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,940
such enjoyment of love,

463
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,580
enjoyment of compassion.

464
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:54,540
It's a different level of enjoyment

465
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,780
that's not like ordinary enjoyments.

466
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,500
You're not to be afraid of Me,

467
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,900
but be afraid of yourself.

468
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,780
Have a watch on yourself and see for yourself

469
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,500
what have you been doing so far.

470
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,900
What have you done so far?

471
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:26,380
Because you have been enlightened.

472
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,100
If the enlightened people

473
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,100
cannot give light, what's the use in having them?

474
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,020
Look at these little, little candles.

475
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:42,940
Whatever little light they have, they're giving that light.

476
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,060
They're burning themselves to give that light.

477
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:53,300
If we cannot give that light,

478
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:58,860
what is the use of enlightenment?

479
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:04,740
Enlightened doesn't mean the light for yourself only

480
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,780
the light of love, compassion,

481
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:16,660
which is divine, which is not normal, which is not ordinary,

482
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,580
as you see in the films.

483
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:25,100
It is a divine love which works

484
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:31,340
and that is what makes Me sometimes little weak

485
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,900
when I hear that Sahaja Yogis now

486
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:39,620
are getting involved in money, in cheating.

487
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:44,340
I mean, all kinds of criminal activities they do.

488
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,260
I can't understand. I can't believe it.

489
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,380
After getting the highest,

490
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:58,380
why do you want to go so low as that?

491
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:04,220
Because you have not yet felt what you have got.

492
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:10,020
You have not realised what you have got.

493
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,900
And you don't respect yourself.

494
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:23,260
Still, if you are on the same line and the same level,

495
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:34,140
I must say you have done no justice to Me or to yourself.

496
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,220
We have to work it out.

497
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:41,860
Single-handed, I've done it,

498
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,620
worked very hard, I must say,

499
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:52,940
in the sense that I had to deal with horrible people,

500
00:45:54,460 --> 00:46:01,660
very unkind, very selfish, very cruel.

501
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,380
That doesn't matter.

502
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,820
And such beautiful pearls I have discovered.

503
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:17,140
But you must keep your lustre

504
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,180
and work it out.

505
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:27,220
I'll be very happy to know that Sahaja Yoga is spreading

506
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:32,020
with leaps and bounds, with great speed

507
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:35,900
and that people are really

508
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:43,980
getting into that realm

509
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:51,420
of peace, joy and happiness.

510
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,380
That's My dream

511
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:58,500
and I hope you all will all work it out.

512
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,620
Thank you very much.
