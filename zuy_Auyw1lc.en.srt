About Indian Sages
Aurangabad, India, 19 December 1989

2
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:45,783
So now most of you are here,

3
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:57,721
and it’s a nice place for all of you
to meet from different countries.

4
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:04,272
Aurangabad has a special significance in my own life

5
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:10,877
because my forefathers came from
 a place very near from here,

6
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:15,546
called as Pathan
but originally known as Pratishthan.

7
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:20,930
I think about two years back we were there,

8
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:29,108
and this is the place where Valmiki,
 who wrote the great epic of Ramayana,

9
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:35,900
lived here. And when Sita came,

10
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:43,473
was taken away from her house

11
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,881
and when she was pregnant,

12
00:03:46,906 --> 00:03:53,009
 there was another ashram of his in Nepal where she stayed,

13
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:57,718
and then she was brought here.

14
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:03,276
That’s why you see a kind of a

15
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:13,604
culture of Maharashtra, going to the hills
and also to Nepal, through her

16
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:21,376
and her children who went down,
went to Russia and another to China.

17
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:26,952
 The name of one who went to Russia
was Luv,

18
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:30,381
and another who went to China was Kush.

19
00:04:30,406 --> 00:04:33,238
 So they are called as Slavs.

20
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,870
They were mostly called as Lev,

21
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:40,188
and those who went to China
are called as Kusha.

22
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:44,467
So they lived here from their birth

23
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:48,353
till they became about, say, twelve years of age,

24
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,145
 when Valmiki composed Ramayana

25
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:57,349
and taught them how to sing that song of Ramayana.

26
00:04:57,492 --> 00:05:01,062
So then they went to Ayodhya

27
00:05:01,087 --> 00:05:05,012
 and there they started singing the song.

28
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:08,764
With that singing, Shri Rama was very much touched.

29
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:13,597
They challenged him in a way, that
 there is a lady who was such a chaste person,

30
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:20,449
 who was driven out of - they didn’t know
that was Rama was their father.

31
00:05:21,616 --> 00:05:27,409
Then they came back and stayed here

32
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,915
for some time and then went again to Nepal
because  she was a Nepali lady.

33
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,021
 So I think her father must have arranged
something for her to stay in Nepal

34
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:45,408
 in that Valmiki ashram,
which can be only approached from Bihar,

35
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:48,012
which I have seen Myself.

36
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:56,000
Also that’s a very important spot where
this ashram was established by Valmiki,

37
00:05:56,017 --> 00:05:59,841
because here there was a big struggle of evolution

38
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:03,388
 going on between the big animals like mammoth

39
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:06,439
and all those big, big animals,

40
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:09,997
between the others who were very quick to turn

41
00:06:10,022 --> 00:06:16,031
and were very clever, intelligent and supple.

42
00:06:16,238 --> 00:06:19,923
They destroyed most of these big animals.

43
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:26,288
And in that river there were lots of crocodiles,

44
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:33,312
and when the king of the elephant, known as Gajendra,

45
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:37,216
 was drinking in water, one of them, a big one,

46
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:43,281
attacked to kill him so that the whole clan,

47
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:49,297
 or you can say the whole genii
of these elephants, would be destroyed.

48
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,092
That spot is very important

49
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:56,680
because there Shri Vishnu appeared

50
00:06:56,705 --> 00:07:00,081
and he killed the crocodile and saved the elephant.

51
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:03,778
So out of all these
big animals, only the elephant was saved,

52
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:08,203
and that’s why that place is called as Gajendramoksh.

53
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:13,077
So there’s a big quarrel going on because
Valmiki had his ashrams in different places,

54
00:07:13,077 --> 00:07:15,742
 where [was real of Valmiki’s things].

55
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:19,499
 But actually he lived here in this area

56
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:22,636
on the other side of the Godavari River

57
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:30,089
which was going along the

58
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:35,282
Paithan or the Pratishthan, the kingdom of Shalivana.

59
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:40,894
And he used to plunder people and he was a plunderer.

60
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,245
 He was a fisherman and he was a plunderer.

61
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:48,942
Then from there they say Narada came as a
saint from there,

62
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:53,629
 from the other side, and they plundered him also.

63
00:07:53,654 --> 00:07:57,371
So he said ,“Why are you plundering me?” Narada asked.

64
00:07:57,396 --> 00:08:01,625
He said, “Because I have to feed my children.
I have to feed my wife.

65
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,457
I have to feed my family. I have to look after them.

66
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:07,731
I have a large family. So how am I to maintain all that?

67
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:10,688
 I am the only person who is the earning member. “

68
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:13,988
But he said, “Do you think
they will sacrifice everything for you?”

69
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:16,876
He said, “I am sure they will.”
He said, “All right."

70
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:20,416
 Now you become like a dead man.”

71
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:24,363
And they took his dead body, so-called, four of them,

72
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:27,506
 four saints, and put it in the house

73
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:32,404
and told them that this fellow died in plundering us.

74
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:37,264
 “But there is a way to again bring him to life,

75
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,729
 that you have to promise that somebody from you,

76
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,534
you all, have to die in his place.

77
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:52,559
If you agree that you will die in his place,
then one person has to replace him.”

78
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:56,904
They tried and tried.

79
00:08:56,929 --> 00:09:00,383
And somebody said, “No, I cannot die. I am too young.”

80
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:03,283
Another said,“No, I have to look after my children.”

81
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:08,189
Another said, “What will happen to my grandchildren?”
all kinds of things.

82
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,571
And nobody offered themselves.

83
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:16,317
So Valmiki got up and he realised that so far

84
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:20,216
he has been really doing something wrong.

85
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:24,402
So he said then, “What should I say?”

86
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:26,876
He said, “What would you say then if you
die?”

87
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:29,545
He said, “I’ll say, ‘Mara, mara’,” means,

88
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,610
 ‘I am dead. I am dead. I am dead’.”

89
00:09:31,635 --> 00:09:33,190
He said, “All right, say the other way.

90
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:36,949
 Go on saying.” So it came to,
 “Rama, Rama,” like that.

91
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:38,887
But they said, “It won’t work out.

92
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:40,892
You have to do a penance

93
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:44,225
because you have done lots of bad things in your life

94
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,738
and you have hurt many people.

95
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:50,262
 So you have to do the penance.”

96
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:56,954
So he sat down for penance on a big mountain here

97
00:09:56,992 --> 00:09:59,321
which is called as the Valmiki Mountain.

98
00:10:00,624 --> 00:10:03,510
And the termites ate up his body,

99
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,607
and he became like a termite.

100
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:07,878
Only his neck was up and he was saying that

101
00:10:07,903 --> 00:10:11,145
and the whole body was eaten up by termites.

102
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,471
So then again Shri Vishnu appeared before him

103
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:18,716
 and removed his termites and gave him his realisation.

104
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:23,156
 And a termite in Sanskrit language is called as valmi.

105
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:25,796
That’s why he was called as valmi ki. That’s why

106
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:28,114
he was called as Valmiki.

107
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:35,844
So the story then afterwards leads
 to the coming of Sita there.

108
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:40,396
So it is a very important part of Ramayana was played here,

109
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:44,362
 and it is said that Shalivahanas helped

110
00:10:44,387 --> 00:10:50,139
this Valmiki temple and Valmiki person to prosper,

111
00:10:50,164 --> 00:10:54,760
 and they treated him with great respect as their master.

112
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:58,765
 But actually, their master was long
time back was one Chandalia

113
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,372
 where we have taken the land near Nira River.

114
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:07,871
 So it’s a very ancient time thousands of years back

115
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:13,000
because Rama must have lived before Krishna,
say about eight thousand years back.

116
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:17,691
 So it is a very ancient place, this one is.

117
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:20,672
After that people removed all the trees and all that.

118
00:11:20,697 --> 00:11:23,148
 So it has become such a barren land

119
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:30,974
and it is not sort of so fertile now,

120
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:35,189
 but once upon a time it was a beautiful forest here

121
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:39,786
 and in that forest Valmiki used to live.

122
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:42,174
So this is the story of this place, I hope

123
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:46,442
 you will be happy to know you are in a very
historical place just now.

124
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:49,758
 And I am trying to find out if you can on your way go to

125
00:11:49,783 --> 00:11:53,006
also to this Paithan, Pratishthan

126
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,014
on your way, maybe. I don’t know how,

127
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,306
because we are all running short of time

128
00:11:57,331 --> 00:12:00,355
because of aeroplane timings, as you know.

129
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:04,140
But in any case I am very happy
that also Italians have arrived,

130
00:12:04,165 --> 00:12:07,089
 and they have taken so much trouble to come all the way

131
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:10,142
directly from there to get to the puja.

132
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:15,030
Though I had arranged in Pratishthan
 all their food, everything, breakfast,

133
00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:18,104
so they could sleep in the night and early in the morning

134
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:21,518
take the food and come here.

135
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:25,099
All these stories these
people know very well.

136
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:29,272
We all know everything about our country,
 these ancient times,

137
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:36,730
 you see, grand, beautiful, and the
work of all these saints and all these

138
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:45,033
seers has woven into the character of Maharashtran people.

139
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:49,998
 So you will find them that they have certain gifts

140
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:54,935
already to protect themselves,
which has come because of the

141
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:02,741
 following of these saints and
the following of a realised soul.

142
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:05,460
And the people are very God-fearing

143
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:11,215
and they respect saints and
they also know who is a real saint mostly.

144
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,607
I hope you all will understand that

145
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:21,424
when we think of the comfort of our spirit,

146
00:13:21,454 --> 00:13:25,955
 the whole life is sort of penetrated
with the light of the spirit,

147
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,102
 and we start changing our attitude towards life.

148
00:13:29,127 --> 00:13:33,988
 Not only that, but also we have a kind of a

149
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,542
 tremendous confidence in our virtues
and we enjoy them.

150
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,443
We do not indulge into any such thing.

151
00:13:43,476 --> 00:13:45,748
 Though in a way we can say that the,

152
00:13:45,773 --> 00:13:51,466
 in this culture there is not much of finesse,
not much of artificiality.

153
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:54,911
They won’t say thank you a hundred times.
 That is not done.

154
00:13:54,943 --> 00:13:56,522
They don’t say sorry.

155
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:59,438
They won’t even fold their hands to normally,

156
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,883
 the women especially to men, and say namaskar.

157
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,547
Only to God they fold their hands.

158
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,952
So there are certain things, that

159
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:10,663
 all the time we go on shaking hands in the West.

160
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:14,085
All the time we start bowing to everyone, saying sorry,

161
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:15,833
 thank you and all that.

162
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:17,559
That you will find they don’t do,

163
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:20,957
 but at heart they are very simple people.

164
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:25,870
 They live among rocks; so they
have that rocky character.

165
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:28,006
 And I hope you will enjoy them.

166
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:30,463
May God bless you.
