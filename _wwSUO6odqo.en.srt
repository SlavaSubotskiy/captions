1
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,243
Its very interesting the way you have found out

2
00:00:05,577 --> 00:00:09,577
today is the real Guru Purnima.

3
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,577
The Purnima is the day when the moon is full.

4
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:19,660
I knew this but for Sahaja Yogis we have to arrange

5
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:23,952
Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Friday,Saturday, Sunday.

6
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:29,160
Whenever either it is on the date or not we have to arrange

7
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:30,077
so it in that case,

8
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:39,577
this time it was I think two days before So it doesn't matter,

9
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:44,869
after all, moon is there for us and we are for moon,

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:51,077
so it can't be some thing that would have very wrong in it.

11
00:00:58,785 --> 00:01:04,577
I have already told you such a lot about the Guru principle.

12
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:07,869
And the guru principle,

13
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:13,077
we have seen people who came on this Earth

14
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:16,077
they were all mostly born realised

15
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:20,660
actually, and they never gave realisation to anyone

16
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:22,160
it's a very big difference.

17
00:01:22,493 --> 00:01:30,077
They were all born as realised souls and they  became Sufis

18
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,077
and they are called by different names,

19
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:39,285
but they were not given self realisation, they had it

20
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:43,660
and because of their self realisation as they had,

21
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:46,160
they have so much of knowledge

22
00:01:46,493 --> 00:01:50,785
and that is  what they try to impart to people.

23
00:01:52,997 --> 00:01:56,660
They knew all about Chakras everything they knew,

24
00:01:56,994 --> 00:02:03,660
somehow, must be in their past life achievements that they knew it,

25
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:11,869
perhaps some of them were disciples of  other very great people.

26
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:16,201
I don't know how they had full ideas to

27
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:21,077
what is self realisation is

28
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:25,702
what do we achieve after self realisation .

29
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:30,785
Now the only person, I think, Mohammed Sahib, is the one

30
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:36,493
who has talked about Miraj is the ascent

31
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:41,077
Miraj is the ascent through our Kundalini.

32
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:44,285
Of course in India they did talked about it,

33
00:02:44,577 --> 00:02:48,077
but in any other country they didn't say it so clearly

34
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,785
that there is something called Miraj.

35
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:54,493
And, not only that He talked of Miraj

36
00:02:54,785 --> 00:03:02,493
but also he talked of the resurrection time

37
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:05,077
when your hands will speak.

38
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,702
Two things He said,

39
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,410
first that your hands will speak

40
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:13,910
when you will get your realisation .

41
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:18,493
It's a very great thing to say

42
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:23,285
because that is how you can ascertain and you can be sure

43
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:26,285
that you got your realisation.

44
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:28,577
That's the sign He gave,

45
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,410
and the second thing He talked about Miraj

46
00:03:32,702 --> 00:03:36,618
and the white horse He said was nothing  but the Kundalini,

47
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:41,994
He didn't used the word Kundalini but He said it's a white horse.

48
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:48,119
So He is the one who knew what should happen to the

49
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:50,119
people when they got their self realisation.

50
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:54,618
That's the great revelation to all of you

51
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,618
and of such a help to Sahaja Yoga.

52
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,201
You are all realised souls

53
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:05,410
because you can feel the vibrations one thing,

54
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:11,702
and secondly how you have become He explained it very clearly.

55
00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:16,119
We have so many saints in India, so many of them,

56
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:20,493
one better than the other and whatever they talked,

57
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:25,827
whatever they say, is so remarkableâ€¦ is so remarkable.

58
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:33,326
But actually, human beings, I  think we are very dumb,

59
00:04:33,618 --> 00:04:37,994
that they never realised that we have so many saints here.

60
00:04:38,326 --> 00:04:42,827
Even in Turkey we had Sufis where it's a Sunni religion,

61
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:46,119
there too, we had so many Sufis

62
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,119
all over the world. We had realised souls,

63
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,326
they were not incarnations, but they were born realised souls.

64
00:04:55,618 --> 00:05:02,535
So you see their explanation and everything is very good  because

65
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:06,201
they were human beings and what ever they said

66
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:12,035
was very much good for human beings to understand.

67
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:14,410
Because an incarnation said something,

68
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:16,535
it is something from the beyond

69
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:20,535
and this new,

70
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:26,618
I should say, advice of the people who were

71
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,618
really human beings and had become realised souls and

72
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:37,035
how they have talked about the various things is very remarkable.

73
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:39,743
Firstly most of them were poets

74
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:45,410
and this, we had Kabir in India,

75
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:47,618
we don't know how he was born,

76
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:50,827
where he was from, who were his parents,

77
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:53,119
it's absolutely not known,

78
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:58,910
despite that you can only make out from their poetry that

79
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:01,827
he was the great great Sahaj Yogi,

80
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:04,910
and how he have described things very interesting.

81
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:10,535
He brought forth so many fundamental truths in his poetry

82
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:12,618
and he talked about it.

83
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:15,827
He didn't belong to any religion, as such,

84
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:20,952
when he died there was a fight between Hindus and Muslims :

85
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:25,451
what should we do with his body.

86
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:30,743
And they say when they had lifted the sheet

87
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:34,618
they found flowers, two types of flower one for Hindus

88
00:06:34,952 --> 00:06:39,535
and one for Muslims,

89
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:41,952
so that's how he have solved the problems

90
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:45,119
of this stupid fight people were having.

91
00:06:45,451 --> 00:06:51,618
In Sahaj Yoga we are not belonging to any such stupid religion,

92
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:56,035
we belongs to one religion that is Vishwa Nirmal Dharma

93
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:59,119
and all the stupidity of all these religions

94
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:01,326
we should really throw away

95
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,743
because, what you just see now today

96
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:08,660
every where, every religious group is fighting each other,

97
00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:12,326
beating each other, finishing each other,

98
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,952
is not the way a religious person should be like that

99
00:07:18,243 --> 00:07:19,660
but  they are killing each other.

100
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:22,827
I mean, all kind of  horrible things they are doing,

101
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:27,952
unbelievable how they can do that, such cruelty.

102
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:32,451
And first thing is for a yogi,

103
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:38,952
or for a saint, cruelty is  absolutely not  there,

104
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:43,035
they will sacrifice their lives, they will do any thing,

105
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:45,535
but they will not be cruel to any other person.

106
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:50,451
Now, those who in the name of God and in the religion are cruel

107
00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:55,119
are actually not at all by  any chances religious people.

108
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:59,535
So this is what the perversion of religion is,

109
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:03,368
we all should understand, if we belong to Sahaj Yoga

110
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,368
then for us kindness, sweetness, compassion and love

111
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,869
is the main qualities we should have

112
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:17,077
and if  you don't have that, then we are not Sahaj Yogis.

113
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:20,451
So we are a different clan,

114
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:26,077
I should say, a  different personalities,

115
00:08:26,368 --> 00:08:27,451
who are really realised souls,

116
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,869
who are above all these nonsensical ideas

117
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,160
and who have vibrations.

118
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:40,451
But, as I said, that now you must spread it

119
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:42,869
because I have come on this Earth

120
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:46,660
just for people to get their emancipation,

121
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:48,952
get their realisation

122
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:52,160
and unless and until all the people

123
00:08:52,368 --> 00:08:57,952
who believe in their emancipation get it, I won't be happy.

124
00:08:58,285 --> 00:08:59,785
There are many people who do believe

125
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:03,577
but not yet got their realisation,

126
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:06,785
so you have to work and you will be amazed

127
00:09:07,077 --> 00:09:10,577
you will find people who are very anxious to get their realisation.

128
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:14,785
It will work out on this Guru Purnima day,

129
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:16,577
it is a very auspicious day.

130
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:20,368
I bless you with a special power

131
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,077
that you can give realisation to other.

132
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:26,077
Don't get involved in your own problems,

133
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:29,577
that's not important, that will all be solved.

134
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:34,869
Mostly what I got letters about is their own personal problems

135
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,994
or some sort  of other problems.

136
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,994
What you should do is to see what is your problem within you

137
00:09:40,285 --> 00:09:45,077
what is happening within you, why we are having a problem within,

138
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:51,160
what is our duty, why we have got  our self realisation,

139
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:55,368
why we   have got this wealth of spirituality

140
00:09:55,577 --> 00:09:57,869
and what should we do with it.

141
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,077
I tell you really think about it every day,

142
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:06,785
even for half an hour, you will realise that

143
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:11,702
you are very well equipped people.

144
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:16,201
Saints have done so much, they have written so many things

145
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:18,702
they have fought the people, they did everything.

146
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,577
You don't have to do anything like that,

147
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:23,994
but one thing is that you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

148
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:30,493
Even now Sahaj Yoga is not so much accepted everywhere,

149
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:32,702
people don't know about it,

150
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:36,577
it's surprising while all kinds of horrible gurus

151
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:37,869
are very well known.

152
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:41,577
So we have to do it by our behaviour,

153
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:47,994
by our understanding, by our whole life, people should say

154
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:51,910
that these are something rare people and different people.

155
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:57,077
I am happy today is another day of Guru Purnima

156
00:10:57,285 --> 00:11:00,201
which is a very auspicious day

157
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,410
and to be regarded as a very big blessing for you

158
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:09,410
because this gives you, I mean this is a certificate,

159
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:13,910
that you all are capable of being Gurus.

160
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:15,785
You have to become that,

161
00:11:15,994 --> 00:11:20,201
becoming is important, in Sahaj Yoga becoming is important,

162
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:23,410
all other things are really of no use.

163
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:27,785
You have to become, specially ladies are shy I think.

164
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:31,201
They can do a lot and they should work it out,

165
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:35,910
they are shy for nothing at all, what is the need to be shy?

166
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,702
They are very shy ladies and

167
00:11:38,994 --> 00:11:46,994
they just don't get into the whole working of  Sahaj Yoga,

168
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:50,702
You should. If the ladies start talking about it,

169
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:52,994
I think it will work much faster.

170
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:56,785
And I bless you all to do this work,

171
00:11:56,994 --> 00:12:00,201
which was left half done by the Saints,

172
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:03,702
it's your duty to complete it .

173
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:05,493
May God Bless You.
