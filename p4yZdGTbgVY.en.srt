1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:15,920
It’s so beautiful to come back to London to meet\h
all of you, again, after such a big gap, I felt.

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,880
It’s a funny feeling one gets when you\h
leave the country and you are away,\h\h

3
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,840
and then you find other people\h
same way when you leave them.

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:43,840
You feel an ocean of compassion and love.

5
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,880
We have been very successful in India.

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:58,000
Indian climate is, I think, changing very fast and\h\h

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
people are finding it easier to\h
take to Sahaj Yog than before.

8
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:11,840
Luckily, some people were cured by Sahaj\h
Yog which made people think about it.

9
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,160
Apart from that, they found out,\h
as you found out about Blake,\h\h

10
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:30,000
that a gentleman, a very famous seer known\h
as Bhrugu, who wrote the prophecies about\h\h

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,080
modern times two thousand years back, has talked\h
about Sahaja Yoga very clearly and he says that,\h\h

12
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,600
not so precise as Blake is but,\h
in a way, about Sahaja Yoga, that\h\h

13
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:01,520
the Kundalini Shakti will be\h
awakened in a very Sahaja way.

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,760
And that it’s a new system by which\h
thousands will get realisation.

15
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,040
According to his proportions, in one crore.

16
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,000
Crore is how much Gavin?

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,600
Hundred thousand?

18
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,240
Ten million?

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,160
Ten Million.

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,400
Among ten million people, there will\h
be one person who will get realisation.

21
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,240
Then these people will start\h
giving realisation to others\h\h

22
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,960
and so many will get their\h
Atmasakshatkar, means Self-realisation.

23
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,560
Also he describes about vibrations and so many\h
things, and what happens after realisation.

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,000
That you can start seeing the Kundalini and\h
all those minute things with your naked eyes.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,080
That you can see the throbbing of\h
the Kundalini with this new method.

26
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,000
And so many things he has described: that\h\h

27
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,760
they had to take to Sahaja Yoga because they knew\h
this was it – that’s what you have to expect.

28
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,880
And it worked out so well that\h\h

29
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,840
thousands and thousands of people, thousands.

30
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,120
Now, it is very important for these seers to see\h\h

31
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,880
those things of the future because human\h
beings are such that, unless and until they\h\h

32
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,960
have something already certified, you see – the\h
‘bonafides’ of a person – people don’t believe,\h\h

33
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,040
and that’s why it was important that such\h
a thing was written about Sahaja Yoga.

34
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,400
Because what I have studied\h
with other people who came to me\h\h

35
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,880
from other groups is that: most\h
of them were brainwashed people.

36
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,760
I mean, they didn’t know what they were talking\h
about, they didn’t know what was Kundalini,\h\h

37
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,280
they didn’t know what was Self-realisation,\h
they did not know any one of their own powers,\h\h

38
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,280
they did not know how to work it out – nothing!\h
I mean they were just zeros! Just zeros you see.

39
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,720
And they just were wearing some dresses and\h
things like that and wearing some sort of\h\h

40
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:23,680
a necklace or maybe a bangle in the hand, to\h
say that they belong to a particular cult,\h\h

41
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,960
but they didn’t know what it was,\h
actually nothing was intelligible to\h\h

42
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,640
me, to understand why were they in\h
that cult, what were they doing there.

43
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,520
And everybody was hoping for\h
the future, for the future.

44
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,920
I concluded on one point: I think most\h
of the Western people are futuristic.

45
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,440
They live in the future.

46
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,680
Neither in the past, nor in the\h
present, but they live in the future.

47
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,680
And these futuristic tendencies\h
make you hope for something better,\h\h

48
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,040
that something will come\h
out, something will work out.

49
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,440
“Let me do what I’m doing, is alright."

50
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:13,600
And they don’t even want to think that, “What\h
I am doing, is it correct or incorrect?”\h\h

51
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,440
They just accept whatever they have accepted.

52
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,920
Maybe it’s also another ego-trip,\h\h

53
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,640
perhaps, that, “I have accepted this, now\h
I don’t want to change,” sort of a thing.

54
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,200
But I was surprised, they\h
didn’t know anything about\h\h

55
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,840
God, about themselves, about their Spirit,\h
about their Kundalinis, about their chakras,\h\h

56
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,480
about anybody’s chakras – nothing! They\h
were just in the dark, lost people.

57
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,600
And real seekers, absolutely real seekers!

58
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,040
I was amazed at the way they got realisation also.

59
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,280
Some of the foreigners who came\h
in Delhi were wonderful people.

60
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,160
But they said, “We think drug is the\h
way!” I said, “But why do you think\h\h

61
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,200
like that?” You see they have conceptions which\h
are futuristic also, that, “We are experimenting\h\h

62
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,640
with this we are experimenting with that, and\h
definitely we are going to reach somewhere."

63
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,760
But, supposing, if you are coming to Caxton Hall\h
and if you are directed towards the airport,\h\h

64
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,360
how will you come to Caxton Hall?

65
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,360
Maybe if you go round the whole world,\h
maybe! If you think the world is round.

66
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,080
But the plane of God, is not a round world.

67
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,160
It’s an ascent.

68
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,720
It’s an ascent.

69
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,960
It’s not that you can go here, there, there,\h
everywhere, and then somehow you find God.

70
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,760
It’s not like that.

71
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,600
Or somehow you find your Spirit.

72
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,960
It’s a higher level.

73
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,000
It’s a higher position one has to rise [to].

74
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,640
It’s not at the same level\h
[that] you are going to find it.

75
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,880
This they don’t understand.

76
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,840
They don’t understand.

77
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,880
They think that on this level only if\h
you move, with this human awareness,\h\h

78
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,920
what we have, with our rationality, with our\h
thinking, by our reading, we’ll achieve that.

79
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,400
I was amazed, I mean, I didn’t know\h
that human beings think like that,\h\h

80
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,960
that you can achieve anything with your\h
rationality and with your intelligence.

81
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,080
You cannot! What can you achieve?

82
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,320
Because whatever is to be achieved,\h
you have already achieved that.

83
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:24,480
But what is to be understood [is] that, these\h
futuristic people think that the way they are\h\h

84
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,640
progressing, or whatever the way they are moving,\h
[that] they are moving the right direction.

85
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,320
Until they are completely finished and\h
fagged out how are they going to find out?

86
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,640
It’s a complete brainwash for these\h
people and it’s a very dangerous thing.

87
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,600
I was myself so much upset with all that.

88
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,400
But I do not know what is the solution for\h
these people if they are that futuristic.

89
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,040
Now we must know what happens to a\h
person when he becomes futuristic.

90
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,080
It’s a very dangerous\h
situation also [in] every way.

91
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,120
Physically, mentally, emotionally, in every\h
way, a futuristic person has lots of problems.

92
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,720
The first problem that arises by living\h
into the future is that you forget the past.

93
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,760
You completely forget the past.

94
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,000
You just live in the future, you forget the past.

95
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,800
You don’t even remember, sometimes, your own\h
name! We had one gentleman who came to see me.

96
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,320
He was the president of a Dhulia conference\h
or something, a big man, supposed to be.

97
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,200
He came round.

98
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,280
And he didn’t remember even his\h
wife’s name! Can you imagine?

99
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,720
And the wife was crying, poor thing.

100
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,160
She said, “He doesn’t even remember my\h
name Mother! It’s gone so bad as that."

101
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:50,640
So I asked him, “Do you remember your name?” So he\h
said, “Well, I think…let me think, let me think.."

102
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,280
Now thinking is moving right side! You\h
see, left side is finished! “I think.."

103
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,920
again.

104
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:03,680
He couldn’t! And I found out from him that\h
he was planning and he was doing this.

105
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,440
“I’m going to do this to Dhulia’s city.

106
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,160
I’m going to work out this for\h
Dhulia city and I’m going to\h\h

107
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,920
arrange this…” and everything was in\h
his mind but nothing that was past.

108
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,960
And the balance was so much upset that he\h
was absolutely future and nothing of past.

109
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,840
He had very high blood pressure,\h
very high blood pressure.

110
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,160
And imagine a person who doesn’t\h
even remember his own name,\h\h

111
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,520
to walk about in the streets\h
of London! One would be lost.

112
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,320
You know, police would have to catch\h
hold of him and put him in a jail.

113
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
It’s a very abnormal situation.

114
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,360
But we reach that situation because we\h
start enjoying that kind of a thinking,\h\h

115
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,720
indulging into that kind of a rationality\h
and then ending up with a life like that:\h\h

116
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,320
high blood pressure, heart\h
trouble, diabetes, paralysis.

117
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,840
Anything is possible with this kind\h
of movement of futuristic attitude.

118
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,560
But future does not exist, does not exist.

119
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,520
It is just in our mind.

120
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,160
And whatever is in our mind is not reality.

121
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,240
That we have conceived ourselves.

122
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,880
Reality is what it is.

123
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,000
You cannot conceive it.

124
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,240
It exists.

125
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,040
Only thing what we can do is to rise up to it\h\h

126
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,120
and to see for ourself what\h
reality is, actually what it means.

127
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,840
Now the trouble with this ego business\h
is that it’s like a balloon, you know.

128
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,080
It’s really like a balloon.

129
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,560
The more you start thinking about\h
it, it takes you away from reality,\h\h

130
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,760
like as if you float in the air and\h
you don’t know what you are doing.

131
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,720
You have lost all contacts with the Mother\h
Earth and you are floating in the air.

132
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,440
This has started in us because when we became\h
human beings from the animal stage you see,\h\h

133
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:06,880
we started taking up upon ourselves\h
the responsibility, responsibility to\h\h

134
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,920
be ourselves, that we are something: I am\h
something, you are something, you are Mr.

135
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,720
X, you are Mr.

136
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,520
Y, you are Mr.

137
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:13,760
Z.

138
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,200
But as human beings are – go to the extremes\h
as usual – they cannot stop at a point.

139
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,400
So they went into such a limit of extremes [that]\h
now they have forgotten also ‘I’, who is this ‘I’.

140
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,320
You ask the name they said, “By\h
the way I think this, that."

141
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,480
So all identifications are lost with the past.

142
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,280
And one may say that it is\h
a very good thing because\h\h

143
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,680
they were all misidentifications [that] are lost.

144
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,880
But even the identifications with\h
the future are also hallucinations.

145
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,840
That’s not the Truth.

146
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,520
That’s not the Truth.

147
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,320
One has to be in the present.

148
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,280
And how do you do it?

149
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,800
Not by listening to any lecture or\h
going to any library to find out.

150
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,040
You cannot do it, again, with\h
this brain that is today.

151
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:12,240
You have to have a brain which has that spark\h
in it, that light in it – enlightened brain.

152
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,880
You are to be an enlightened person.

153
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,800
Unless and until you are enlightened\h\h

154
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,280
you cannot see your way through, you are walking\h
in the dark, really you are walking in the dark.

155
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,120
And when this light comes into you…that is the\h
light within us, placed there all the time.

156
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,600
Is the light of our Spirit.

157
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,120
It has to come in our attention.

158
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,640
And God has arranged\h
everything for us, everything.

159
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:45,600
There’s a way of our germination which\h
has to take place, and when it takes place\h\h

160
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,320
you can feel that Spirit in your attention.

161
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,880
Now there is another misunderstanding\h
I find [that] people have about Spirit:\h\h

162
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,760
they think Spirit is an energy.

163
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,240
It is not! It’s not an energy.

164
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,800
Energy can be transformed, it can be changed, it\h
can be evolved, it can be handled and all that.

165
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,040
Spirit is not! Spirit is absolute! It cannot be\h
compared with anything else that you know of.

166
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,200
It is an absolute thing.

167
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,640
It resides in your heart.

168
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,920
It’s the reflection of God\h
Almighty, within ourselves.

169
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,080
And you cannot call it an energy.

170
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,360
Energy can be finished off, spent\h
away, it can disappear into thin air.

171
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,720
Not the Spirit.

172
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,240
It’s a permanent entity.

173
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,320
It is absolute, by itself, and it\h
cannot be compared with anything else.

174
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,240
I mean, just to give an\h
analogy, one can say something,\h\h

175
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,560
but that’s a different point – just to give.

176
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,320
But you cannot compare an absolute\h
with anything that is relative.

177
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,600
So that’s an absolute thing within you, which\h
resides in your heart, and when this residual\h\h

178
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:10,000
power of Kundalini rises it ignites the attention\h
within you with this spark of the Spirit.

179
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,280
Now, supposing, this light is\h
here, take it [as an example].

180
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,520
If you put on this light – of course this\h
light is an energy so you cannot compare\h\h

181
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,840
with anything you know, that’s the trouble, but\h
still [if] you say this is the light – now this\h\h

182
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,120
light enlightens this whole atmosphere\h
and we start seeing things here clearly.

183
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:38,720
But do you think that light which is\h
there is the one that is your attention?

184
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,000
Not at all.

185
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,640
Your attention is enlightened by that light.

186
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:58,080
The light enlightens your attention; by that\h
attention you can feel the All-pervading Power,\h\h

187
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,920
the Divine Power, the energy of God, the Divine\h
Energy of God, the energy of love of God.

188
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,880
You can feel it because it’s a connecting link.

189
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,800
Spirit is the connecting link.

190
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,360
But it is completely absolute.

191
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:26,080
It just connects you to that All-pervading\h
Power, that All-pervading Power.

192
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:36,720
I think we have talked about Creation when\h
we said that, the whole Parabrahma became\h\h

193
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,080
the energy and God Almighty, which was\h\h

194
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,480
lost in the Parabrahma, means [in] a\h
sleeping state, became the Witness.

195
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,840
Now this Witness is in the heart of human beings.

196
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,920
This Witness is all the time there.

197
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,440
When it disappears you do not\h
exist! So it is not an energy.

198
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,120
One has to understand.

199
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,600
Actually someone has written a book on Sahaja Yoga\h
and when I was going through it I was shocked to\h\h

200
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,880
read that he thinks that Spirit is an\h
energy! So, energy, the Shakti, is not\h\h

201
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,800
that Spirit and the Spirit is not Shakti.

202
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,840
They have to meet.

203
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
They have to meet so that\h\h

204
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,240
the enlightenment in human beings, [of]\h
the chitta (attention), takes place.

205
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,600
Our ideas, whatever they are, are ideas.

206
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,480
Even when I say to you\h
something, I have always told\h\h

207
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,440
that you shouldn’t take me for granted\h
– you should see [for] yourself.

208
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,840
You should see for yourself how it works out.

209
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
But first of all you must have that\h\h

210
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:00,720
microscope – the Spirit – you must\h
have that level of understanding.

211
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,200
You should go to that point,\h
you must have the breakthrough.

212
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,560
If you have not broken through\h
that you won’t understand anything.

213
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,600
You are not yet connected,\h
there’s no enlightenment.

214
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,840
Without enlightenment what’s the use of talking?

215
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,080
Now, supposing I go and tell you\h
there are red coloured curtains here\h\h

216
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:25,920
and there’s a black coloured beams here,\h
anything, and if the other person is blind,\h\h

217
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,160
they are not going to understand anything [about]\h
what is black what is red, what is yellow.

218
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,680
But this is the truth, that we are blind.

219
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,320
And also this is the truth that we can see.

220
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,920
And then we can see the real Truth.

221
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,760
So the truth that appears\h
before us now is not the Truth.

222
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,000
After realisation it is the real Truth.

223
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,320
I know one thing that, in the West,\h
the rationality has gone too far.

224
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,760
People rationalise everything, which\h
has killed all the joy of life.

225
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,960
Everything they rationalise,\h
which kills the joy of life.

226
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,760
In the East people just do not\h
rationalise, they do not think about it.

227
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,120
That is also going too far.

228
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,120
But there is a meeting point\h
between the East and the West.

229
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,120
And the greatest [thing] of all is that\h
the West has discovered the science.

230
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,360
Science is responsible, today, for Sahaja Yoga.

231
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,080
Only through science we are going\h
to spread Sahaja Yoga – if people\h\h

232
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,640
understand what is the meaning of Sahaja Yoga is.

233
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,960
It’s a very dynamic thing no doubt.

234
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,160
It’s working out tremendous things.

235
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:49,440
But not in the places where people are\h
very rationally judging everything.

236
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,000
Like a tree has got a shoot and a root.

237
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,480
If it has got a shoot it has to have a root,\h\h

238
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,440
otherwise shoot cannot hang in\h
the air! It has to have a root.

239
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,680
Now, in the West, we are the shoots.

240
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,840
You see, everybody can see everything.

241
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,080
You can see what we have achieved,\h
“This is the achievement."

242
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,040
We have got big, huge affluent societies.

243
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,360
People are working out all kinds\h
of gadgets and this and that.

244
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,560
But from where is the energy coming?

245
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,760
Somebody must have worked the down way\h
also, in the root, which you cannot see.

246
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,960
To understand the root you\h
have to change your style.

247
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,400
It’s alright, to become the shoot was different,\h
but supposing you have to understand the root,\h\h

248
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,280
you have to go down and you\h
have to change your attitude.

249
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:51,840
And that attitude is of trying to\h
understand that we are not yet our Spirit.

250
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,960
All the prophets, all the great incarnations\h
have said that, “You are to be born again,”\h\h

251
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,840
that you have to become the Spirit.

252
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,560
We are not.

253
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,200
Let us very humbly accept that.

254
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,200
If you accept that, that we are not\h
yet realised souls – that’s all,\h\h

255
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,200
we have to know – then it’s easier.

256
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,000
But if we think, now people come to Sahaja\h
Yoga’s system, I have seen, in the West,\h\h

257
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,400
it’s very difficult to convince them.

258
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,240
I have to sit in a particular manner\h
I have to talk in a particular manner\h\h

259
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,680
and I may not be that good\h
at English manners maybe.

260
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,080
So they will say that, “Oh, this lady is no good,\h
she doesn’t know any English manners!” you see.

261
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,600
And they’ll judge you on\h
some superficial things which\h\h

262
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,440
may be good for the shoot, but not for the root.

263
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,160
Under these circumstances it is rather\h
difficult to convince people about Sahaj Yoga.

264
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,440
But you must know that I am now talking\h
about the roots and not about the shoot.

265
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,000
Shoot you have got, you have got it, but\h
you have to find the sustenance of it.

266
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,240
If you do not find it, the\h
whole thing will topple down.

267
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,360
As it is very important to have the shoot,\h\h

268
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,880
it’s even more important sometimes\h
to have a root, after some time,\h\h

269
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,120
because if you are exhausted in your energy\h
it’s better to develop your root system,\h\h

270
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:23,520
enrich it so that you sustain your society much\h
better and achieve the fruits of your creation.

271
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,880
I see some new faces here and I’m\h
very happy to see that there are\h\h

272
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,640
some new people who have come to Sahaj Yog.

273
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,320
For all the new people I would like to say one\h
thing: that many people come to Sahaja Yoga\h\h

274
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,040
out of which, of course, now we have many people\h
who are now realised souls here, sitting down.

275
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,080
It’s a great thing that there are so many\h
realised souls in England, specially in London.

276
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,880
But many are lost because they\h
just judge things on their own way.

277
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,040
So I have to request that you must give\h
some time to yourself and to Sahaja Yoga,\h\h

278
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,480
because you are all seekers.

279
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,080
I don’t want you to be lost.

280
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,480
The other day somebody read me out from John’s\h\h

281
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:17,520
Gospel that he says that only\h
144,444 people will be saved.

282
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,560
I said, “This is very miserly\h
of him to say such a thing!”\h\h

283
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,240
“That’s all?” I said, “That’s\h
all?” I mean how can it be?

284
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,280
Only such a small number?

285
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,320
I just couldn’t believe that\h
how could he say such a thing.

286
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,000
Perhaps his counting is wrong I think, or\h
whatever it is, but I hope so it’s not that bad.

287
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,080
And how many are going to join\h
from England, we have to see.

288
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:58,080
Blake had great ideas, he wanted to build\h
Jerusalem, and he went into all kinds of details.

289
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,680
I hope we’ll be able to do\h
some justice to him as well.

290
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:16,560
It is a great pleasure to come back to your\h
own children after such a long stay there.

291
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,640
I always thought of you here.

292
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,400
All of you were in this cold, facing\h
the cold weather of this country.

293
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:37,760
And also, was thinking that, one day, this country\h
will become a great country of spiritual life.

294
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,240
I know this has to work\h
out from this country only.

295
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:49,840
In India of course, it’s very easy,\h
but this country is the heart, heart,\h\h

296
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,080
and we have to establish here.

297
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,240
It’s difficult I know, but we\h
all have to work very hard.

298
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:05,040
And, after this, I hope you all decide to go all\h
over, wherever possible, to spread Sahaja Yoga.

299
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,600
That is the greatest thing that we have to do.

300
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:14,640
This year, according to astrology in India,\h
the English are going to come up with new ideas\h\h

301
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,880
and I would like to know their new ideas\h
when we have this birthday celebration.

302
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,760
So, is it for birthday celebration today\h
that, Gavin, you have arranged this programme?

303
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,760
Birthdays are good when you are growing, but when\h
you are getting old they are not so good isn’t it?

304
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,840
This birthday has a special significance I feel\h\h

305
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,240
because, in that book also,\h
it is written that, this year,\h\h

306
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,560
something great should happen and\h
something great should come up.

307
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,640
And we all have to understand\h
that, if we lose the time,\h\h

308
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,360
maybe we’ll lose many people who are\h
just lost because of their ignorance.

309
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,880
And we have to save them, we\h
have to definitely save them.

310
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,240
There is no doubt [that] they are all seekers.

311
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,640
They are seekers and lost.

312
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,680
It’s our duty to save them.

313
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,840
We have to really work very hard\h\h

314
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:24,400
to find out all such people and go close\h
to them, talk to them and help them.

315
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,840
Thank you very much.

316
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,680
From the new people I would like to\h
have some questions if there are any,\h\h

317
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,320
because when we go into meditation\h
I do not want your mind to come up\h\h

318
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,840
and suddenly say, “Oh, you\h
did not ask this question."

319
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,360
or to think about it or to work it out.

320
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
It’s a spontaneous thing.

321
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:35,760
As you place a seed in the Mother Earth\h\h

322
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:42,000
and the warmth of the Mother Earth, which you can\h
say the love of the Mother Earth sprouts the seed.

323
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,200
In the same way this germination takes place,\h\h

324
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,680
this germination takes place within\h
you, automatically, spontaneously.

325
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,320
You don’t have to do anything about it.

326
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,640
We have done nothing to become human\h
beings and we have to do nothing\h\h

327
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
to become super-human beings also.

328
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,600
Afterwards, after realisation, of\h
course you have to maintain yourself.

329
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,440
Like you have to maintain yourself to be\h
a human being and not to become a beast.

330
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,880
In the same way, you have to remain an angel\h\h

331
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,560
and not to become a fallen angel,\h
after realisation, that’s all.

332
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,840
And it works out, absolutely spontaneously,\h
and you become, again [I’m saying] you become.

333
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,600
You really become a different person.

334
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,240
You start noticing that difference showing in you.

335
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,360
With some people it takes more time.

336
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,840
With some it takes very little.

337
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,640
But I have seen people have to go,\h
in that transition period, carefully.

338
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,200
But it works out, it does work out.

339
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,800
I haven’t yet seen a person who\h
has got realisation [who] is lost.

340
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,120
He comes back I see there are vibrations\h
still he has not worked it out,\h\h

341
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,600
of course, there are problems, but still,\h
you can maintain it, you can put it right.

342
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,920
So this is the Kundalini and there are six\h
centres above that and one centre below.

343
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,480
Now these six centres are within us.

344
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,920
All of us have got it.

345
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:16,000
These are the subtle centres which\h
give us our plexuses and these plexuses\h\h

346
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,680
are the gross manifestation of these centres.

347
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,640
These centres are pierced through.

348
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,120
Only the six centres, because the seventh\h
one is at the base of the Kundalini.

349
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,680
That’s our innocence and that’s the\h
one which is not pierced through.

350
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,560
The Kundalini rises, passing through these\h
centres, pierces through this fontanelle\h\h

351
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,120
bone area, and gives us a\h
real, actual baptism – actual.

352
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,640
It’s not that “I baptise you,”\h
put the hand there, it’s not that.

353
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,600
You actually feel the throbbing on\h
your head and you see the piercing,\h\h

354
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,600
by feeling the cool breeze of the\h
Holy Ghost pouring out of your head.

355
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,200
You can feel it very clearly.

356
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,120
That’s how it is.

357
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:14,560
It is surprising how people reconcile\h
to things because they say that the\h\h

358
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,120
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost is there.

359
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,320
Now where is the cool breeze?

360
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,080
Ask these people.

361
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,760
We say that, “We bless you with the Trinity."

362
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,520
But where is the cool breeze?

363
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,440
Where is the cool breeze?

364
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,480
When you talk of blessing\h
somebody with the Trinity\h\h

365
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,040
there has to be the cool breeze because cool\h
breeze of the Holy Ghost has to be there.

366
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,320
And there is no cool breeze,\h
so how are we to believe that\h\h

367
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,360
what they are saying is what they are meaning?

368
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,200
And that is what is the Truth is.

369
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,200
You have to have the cool breeze of the\h
Holy Ghost and where is the cool breeze?

370
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,520
That’s one of the points one should find out.

371
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,960
Now this cool breeze is not\h
only a simple cool breeze.

372
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,400
It definitely acts, it works, it cures.

373
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:08,240
There is a case, recently, interesting, that I\h
was actually in a village in India when a father\h\h

374
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:20,560
of a son came to see me, who, the son, was sent\h
to America for treatment for blood cancer, And,\h\h

375
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,800
of course, I gave vibrations from there but I\h
asked one of the American girls to treat him\h\h

376
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,680
and he’s cured, hundred percent\h
he’s out of the hospital.

377
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,920
Yes, it can be done! And it is so fantastic.

378
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,960
you can do it.

379
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,840
I need not do.

380
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,480
You can do it.

381
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,600
It’s that girl Christine who has done it and\h
she has cured him, completely, hundred percent.

382
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,920
The boy is out of the hospital\h
and is going back to India.

383
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,280
So all these things can be done.

384
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,120
This has to happen.

385
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:56,480
Once it works out then one has to work\h
out a little bit more to understand\h\h

386
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,320
how to use the power, how to use the power.

387
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,040
It’s very simple, it is so spontaneous.

388
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,360
Nobody told us how to see.

389
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,560
Did anybody tell us?

390
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,080
We have eyes, we can see.

391
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,360
It is so spontaneous.

392
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,000
Because we have got eyes which\h
can see, so we are seeing it.

393
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,440
What is there to be told about\h
it or taught about it that,\h\h

394
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,280
“You see that now there is a…” It is\h
there, we can see it with our own eyes.

395
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,160
What is there to teach?

396
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,360
Do we teach our own nose that\h
there’s a fragrance coming in?

397
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,880
It knows that it is coming in.

398
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,320
This is known as bodha.

399
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,360
It is the knowledge by which you can feel it.

400
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,040
It’s not the knowledge that you read in the books.

401
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:41,840
If you read in the books “The roses\h
smell like this,” will you get the smell?

402
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,680
Or [if] there are some people who wear a\h
Rolls Royce on their neck, a picture of\h\h

403
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,960
Rolls Royce and they think, “We are going in a\h
Rolls Royce very nicely!” Do you do that way?

404
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,320
It’s stupid isn’t it?

405
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,120
But it is the stupid things people do.

406
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,920
They carry on with such artificial\h
things believing that they are doing it.

407
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:08,320
So one has to know that it is an actualisation,\h
it has to happen, it has to work out within you.

408
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,920
You cannot just befool yourself saying\h
that, “I am that, I am this, I am that."

409
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,040
If you say, “I am the governor,”\h
do you become the governor?

410
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,800
It’s simple as that, absolutely very simple.

411
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,760
And, once it happens, as it is\h
simple to you to be a human being,\h\h

412
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,160
it will be as simple to you to be a Sahaja Yogi.

413
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,960
Only thing: to be a Sahaja Yogi you have to know.

414
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,200
As you have learned your language you have to\h
know the language of Sahaja Yoga: what does\h\h

415
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,760
this finger means, if you get the burning on this\h
finger what does that mean, what does this mean.

416
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,240
Everything you have to know, just decoding, and I\h
am here just for decoding, nothing more than that.

417
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,840
Now any more questions?

418
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,960
Seeker: Yes, is it possible for the\h
Kundalini to be opened prematurely?

419
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:13,360
Hypnotism or brainwashing or\h
something and you can do anything\h\h

420
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:18,160
good with it, constructive, is it\h
possible to have this opened prematurely?

421
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,093
In a non-developed state

422
00:34:19,093 --> 00:34:27,680
Shri Mataji: Kundalini doesn’t need any\h
development it is complete by itself.

423
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,280
It doesn’t need any development as such.

424
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:38,560
But, what happens, when the Kundalini passes\h
through these centres, the centres could be sick,\h\h

425
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:47,920
could be constricted, there could be a problem,\h
somebody may be an imbalanced person, or you may\h\h

426
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:53,200
be a person who doesn’t follow certain rules\h
and regulations of sustenance, could be there.

427
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,098
Some sort of a thing is there.

428
00:34:54,098 --> 00:34:59,120
Seeker: Could it be the person might be too open?

429
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,040
Shri Mataji: Yes, vulnerable type\h
who accepts everything, you see.

430
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,600
Seeker: Yes.

431
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,880
Shri Mataji: goes to the lunatic\h
asylums also, wants to be with the\h\h

432
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,440
rogues and wants to be with this,\h
wants to be with that, all that.

433
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,000
You see, such a person can be also in torture.

434
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,520
But that is the path, the path of\h
Kundalini could be in trouble, could be.

435
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,760
But Kundalini is not that way.

436
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,360
Of course, sometimes She is so hurt,\h
I have seen her being very much hurt,\h\h

437
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,840
passing through that path She feels so hurt.

438
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,280
But that’s a different point.

439
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,040
Now this Kundalini is there, just matured,\h
sitting down there, waiting for a moment to rise.

440
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:45,440
Now what happens, when people who are not\h
authorised by Divine Power of God, who are not\h\h

441
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,600
holy people – we should put it straight forward,\h
who are not really holy people but just are\h\h

442
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,200
unholy people, or you can put any strong\h
word you want – ‘hypocrites’ or anything.

443
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,600
If they try any tricks with the Kundalini then\h
there’s a Deity sitting on the first centre,\h\h

444
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:18,080
He hits them hard! And that hitting can cause\h
big problems, like people can develop blisters.

445
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,640
Not the Kundalini, she is extremely kind, she\h
is your Mother, She is not going to do any harm.

446
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:32,320
But this Deity which is the Deity embodying\h
your innocence, it can’t bear any wrong entry\h\h

447
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:38,800
to the Mother, so that Deity gets angry and you\h
get problems of the sympathetic nervous system.

448
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,040
And such people have so many problems.

449
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,680
They can have blisters on the body, even cancer!\h\h

450
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,200
Because these people have no\h
authority, they cannot awaken it.

451
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,640
They cannot awaken it.

452
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:58,400
For example, if you put a seed under\h
a hot blanket, will it prosper?

453
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,200
It will die out.

454
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,880
It has to be the Mother Earth.

455
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,040
In the same way the one who is authorised\h
to do the Kundalini awakening has to do it.

456
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:15,320
Anybody who tries otherwise\h
then He harms the person.

457
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,000
And [it] can be very harmful.

458
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,440
So that kind of a horrible\h
thing happens to many people\h\h

459
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,680
when they just try to bow to wrong type of people.

460
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,560
This head is not to be bowed to anyone\h
who has not given you realisation.

461
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,200
Why should you?

462
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,480
You shouldn’t bow to me also! I have\h
not given you realisation [yet].

463
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,880
When I will give you realisation,\h
then you should bow to me.

464
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,000
But in India if you tell people, “Don’t\h
bow to me,” they have already accepted me,\h\h

465
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,240
you see, so they feel very hurt if I say,\h
“Don’t bow to me you are not realised."

466
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,840
But here I would say, I would prefer a person\h
not to bow to me till he has got his realisation.

467
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,280
That is very important.

468
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,280
Because after all, I may be a hocus-pocus –\h
could be, possibly – so why trust me that way?

469
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,440
Don’t put your head at my feet.

470
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,840
You just have your realisation first and then.

471
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,000
But it is quite true, people are\h
playing havoc with it, absolutely havoc.

472
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,720
It’s very dangerous.

473
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,440
You see a person who doesn’t\h
know how to put on the light\h\h

474
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,640
can burn his fingers and say\h
that electricity is wrong.

475
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,880
But he doesn’t know anything, he’s naive.

476
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,600
To put it very mildly we can say they are naive.

477
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,840
But there are sinister people also who\h
deliberately do it just to torture people.

478
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,280
That’s why people are frightened\h
also to hear about Kundalini.

479
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,880
I know a gentleman has written such a\h
thick book and he says the Kundalini\h\h

480
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,760
is in the stomach! I said, “It’s not there,\h
it’s not there!” I mean, it’s so absurd to\h\h

481
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,120
hear such things, but they right\h
books without any authority.

482
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,040
You see, anybody can talk about God!\h
Hitler used to talk about God also!\h\h

483
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,840
Who’s going to catch hold of him?

484
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,720
But you can see the throbbing of the Kundalini.

485
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,080
In these programmes you can see, of some\h
people, where there’s an obstruction.

486
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,720
On the Nabhi chakra, you can see the\h
throbbing; clearly you can see it.

487
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,440
Many, all, of these people have\h
seen, those who are sitting.

488
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,120
What else?

489
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,000
It’s a good question.

490
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,040
Because it’s very common.

491
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,120
I have seen people have read about Kundalini.

492
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,600
You are all seekers you know, you are all seekers,\h\h

493
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
so you are seeking, you are\h
reading all these books.

494
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:36,080
I know that you are reading all these books\h
and that’s how you know about all these things.

495
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,360
But it’s not the main thing.

496
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:44,800
Main thing is: Kundalini awakening must give\h
you realisation, must give you your own power.

497
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,200
I may be very powerful, or\h
whatever it is, so what?

498
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,640
What’s the use?

499
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,800
Unless and until you have some powers of\h
your own, why should you believe anyone?

500
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,080
But people are brainwashed you see;\h
there is some purpose behind it.

501
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,760
It’s money making propositions.

502
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:11,425
All are money making\h
propositions, take it from me.

503
00:40:11,425 --> 00:40:16,080
Seeker: How do you raise the Kundalini Mother,\h\h

504
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,800
what can you do?

505
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,240
Shri Mataji: Nothing! Just now we’ll do\h
it but it’s nothing [that] has to be done.

506
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,600
That’s the main point.

507
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,640
It’s sahaja.

508
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,000
It’s just spontaneous.

509
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,920
Nothing! What can we do to make a flower a fruit?

510
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,960
It’s as simple as that.

511
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,760
Alright?

512
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,560
It will work out.

513
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:44,720
That’s a good question [it] means\h
you are anxious [to get it].

514
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:52,000
What about getting all the people who are\h
new in front and all the people who are old,\h\h

515
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,120
very old, a little backward (laughing).

516
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,080
So all those.

517
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,480
Is there anybody sitting at the back who is new?

518
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,840
Come forward, please, come forward.

519
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,520
There is nothing to be frightened about Kundalini.

520
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,840
She is your Mother, She’s extremely kind.

521
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,737
Sahaja Yogi: Mother should we make\h
room for people to come and sit down?

522
00:41:21,737 --> 00:41:23,520
Shri Mataji: I mean, they can’t sit on the ground.

523
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,240
So, those who can sit on the ground can come down.

524
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,760
Yes, that’s alright, yah.

525
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,240
First two rows is alright if they are there.

526
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,360
Just come along! Come along! It’s good.

527
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,280
Come here, come here, come forward, yah.

528
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,120
Come along, come, yah.

529
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,840
These are all seekers.

530
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,360
Don’t worry.

531
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,600
Don’t worry about anything.

532
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:01,840
You see, even if you have been taking drugs,\h
if you have been going to other gurus,\h\h

533
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,840
you might think you are a sinner or you\h
might think you are a very guilty person.

534
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,680
Whatever you are thinking, now forget\h
about it! Just forget about it.

535
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,440
Don’t feel guilty, that’s first\h
thing, is – don’t feel guilty.

536
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,438
You should say, “Mother, I am not\h
guilty,” that’s very important.

537
00:42:18,438 --> 00:42:18,650
That’s one thing: that you are not guilty.

538
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:18,777
You are the temple of God.

539
00:42:18,777 --> 00:42:19,008
You have come here to become that, to know that.

540
00:42:19,008 --> 00:42:19,187
So you are not to feel guilty at all.

541
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:19,541
That’s one of the greatest problems\h
of the West is that they feel guilty.

542
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:19,692
So please tell yourself thrice,\h\h

543
00:42:19,692 --> 00:42:20,102
clearly that, “Mother I am not guilty,”\h
For anything! Everything will be forgiven.

544
00:42:20,102 --> 00:42:20,154
What is it?

545
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:20,225
It is nothing.

546
00:42:20,225 --> 00:42:20,607
Say there’s an ocean of forgiveness, an\h
ocean of love, an ocean of compassion.

547
00:42:20,607 --> 00:42:20,668
What is this?

548
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:20,800
Little speck here and there?

549
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:20,899
Cannot be washed off?

550
00:42:20,899 --> 00:42:20,993
It’s very simple.

551
00:42:20,993 --> 00:42:21,205
Your karmas and all that Christ can suck it.

552
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:21,535
He resides here, once he’s awakened\h
he’ll suck all your problems.

553
00:42:21,535 --> 00:42:21,629
Just don’t worry.

554
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:21,691
Trust in Him.

555
00:42:21,691 --> 00:42:21,719
Good.

556
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:21,804
Agnya opening out.

557
00:42:21,804 --> 00:42:22,219
Now what you have to do is to put your hand\h
towards me like this, because these are all\h\h

558
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:22,676
the centres which are to be awakened so the news\h
goes through this, or the message, you can say.

559
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:23,044
And you can put the, both the hands\h
towards me like this and close your eyes.

560
00:42:23,044 --> 00:42:23,138
That’s important.

561
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:23,384
Don’t open your eyes because when Kundalini comes\h\h

562
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:23,733
up here there’s a dilatation of the\h
pupils so just keep your eyes shut.

563
00:42:23,733 --> 00:42:24,087
But sit in a very relaxed manner, very\h
relaxed, very relaxed, very relaxed.

564
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:24,331
Just put both the hands\h
towards me, just like this.

565
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:24,388
Can you put?

566
00:42:24,388 --> 00:42:24,459
Just like this.

567
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:24,591
Put your hands also please.

568
00:42:24,591 --> 00:42:24,737
Why don’t you put your hands?

569
00:42:24,737 --> 00:42:24,878
Seeker: I only came to listen.

570
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:25,100
Shri Mataji: No there’s nothing more talking.

571
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,237
Just put your hands, please.

572
00:42:25,237 --> 00:42:25,463
There’s a right Agnya from the very beginning.

573
00:42:25,463 --> 00:42:25,703
Put both the hands towards me and close your eyes.

574
00:42:25,704 --> 00:42:25,803
Just close your eyes.

575
00:42:25,803 --> 00:42:25,959
(Mother rubs her hands and blows)

576
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:26,066
Keep your eyes closed.

577
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:26,439
If they are flickering then you can open\h
them, otherwise you keep them closed.

578
00:42:26,439 --> 00:42:26,580
And keep the face also still.

579
00:42:26,581 --> 00:42:26,906
No emotions or anything, just keep\h
it still in a mood of witnessing.

580
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:27,255
In a mood of witnessing you should\h
sit, putting both the hands towards me.

581
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:27,590
It works out, actually should work\h
out in a second, split of a second,\h\h

582
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:27,958
but the problem is, because of certain\h
complications it takes time sometimes.

583
00:42:27,957 --> 00:42:28,042
Doesn’t matter.

584
00:42:28,042 --> 00:42:28,320
But it should work out.
