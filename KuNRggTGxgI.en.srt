1
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:57,132
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

2
00:01:57,132 --> 00:02:11,392
When we are seeking the Truth we have to know
we have to be honest about it.

3
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:15,542
Because it is benevolent for us, not for others.

4
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:22,241
We are seeking the Truth for ourselves, not
for others.

5
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:31,581
The another thing we have to remember, very
humbly, that truth is what it is.

6
00:02:31,581 --> 00:02:38,322
We can not change it, we can not organize
it, we can not maneuver it.

7
00:02:38,322 --> 00:02:43,532
It is what has been and will be.

8
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:48,032
And what is the Truth?

9
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:53,521
The truth is that you are the Spirit.

10
00:02:53,521 --> 00:03:03,832
You are not this body, you are not this mind,
you are not this ego, and you are not this

11
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:04,972
conditioning.

12
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:06,871
You are the Spirit.

13
00:03:06,871 --> 00:03:12,542
But so far you have been a humane being.

14
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:21,882
But to be humane being itself is a very great
thing.

15
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:25,911
Is the greatest thing – to be a humane being.

16
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:35,341
Perhaps we have not realized the value of
our life because we do not know what we are.

17
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:48,582
The way we waste our time, waste our energies,
waste our attention on things, which are senseless,

18
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:57,412
because we still have to understand the greatness
of our being.

19
00:03:57,412 --> 00:04:09,722
Humane beings are made with such care, so
beautifully, such delicate working of the

20
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:16,472
Divine from ameba to this stage passing through
various stages, such a beautiful thing has

21
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:20,251
been created as a humane being.

22
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:26,891
But first we must have this attention to our
Self that there must be something.

23
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:35,501
It can not be a purposelessly [WAY or DOING],
it can not be something just a chance.

24
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:38,822
Is a wrong idea to play with.

25
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:53,242
If the gravitation force of the Earth or anyone
of the galaxies changes, then be disaster,

26
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:55,912
absolute disaster.

27
00:04:55,912 --> 00:05:01,492
So many things in the cosmos, if you study,
the coefficients that works out, the different

28
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:08,912
balancing and the different weights and the
movements of the different bodies show us

29
00:05:08,912 --> 00:05:10,591
that there must be some purpose.

30
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:20,492
And they do not trouble us; it’s all as
if made for the stage for humane beings.

31
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:24,421
That the humane beings have to come on the
stage and all the preparation is made for

32
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:28,212
the great drama.

33
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:34,781
I think it’s high time that great scientists
should look at it and start wondering why

34
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:37,922
is it the way it is made.

35
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:42,992
Why we are so much looked after.

36
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:52,002
The whole cosmos seems to be within ourselves
as if we have buttons, which move the cosmos,

37
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:56,511
which control the cosmos.

38
00:05:56,511 --> 00:06:03,732
Everything is going on so smoothly otherwise,
except when we do not try to understand ourselves.

39
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:14,051
It has been said practically in all the Scriptures
that you have to seek your Self; you have

40
00:06:14,051 --> 00:06:16,212
to find your Self.

41
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:26,572
Though I think many of this Scriptures have
been little bit changed and have been used

42
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:34,072
for certain purposes, still they could not
get over this point that you have to become

43
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:38,612
the Self, you have to be born again.

44
00:06:38,612 --> 00:06:41,992
But that is not an artificial thing.

45
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:46,172
We are humane beings not artificially made.

46
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:52,252
We are made really by some sort of a living
force from ameba.

47
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:59,242
We are not just made with some sort of a thinking
or a mental projection.

48
00:06:59,242 --> 00:07:06,902
It is not a mental projection by which we
have been humane beings, it is something spontaneously

49
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:13,572
happening, a living force within us, which
has brought us to this stage - with a purpose,

50
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:15,482
with a meaning.

51
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:22,692
And now at this stage we are free to do what
we like.

52
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:27,852
Many people ask Me, “What was the need to
give this freedom to humane beings?”

53
00:07:27,852 --> 00:07:29,982
It was very necessary.

54
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:37,521
If you have to have the ultimate freedom you
must know how to deal with it.

55
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:38,982
You have to understand.

56
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:43,042
Of course, humane beings have to make mistakes.

57
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:45,332
To err is humane.

58
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:56,152
And we have to understand that this trial
– error and trial and error business – has

59
00:07:56,152 --> 00:08:02,741
made us understand, also those who have not
understood must understand, that there must

60
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:10,632
be a wiser or surer way to achieve that goal
of Self-Realization, of Self-knowledge.

61
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:22,252
Self-knowledge we do not have, we must admit
very humbly, we have had no system by which

62
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,032
we could know ourselves.

63
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:28,542
But think of a computer that is a humane being
is.

64
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,942
As soon as you see Me you know I am there.

65
00:08:31,942 --> 00:08:39,361
You don’t have to go for programming, you
don’t have to consult anything, you don’t

66
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:47,272
have to use any kind of computer or some sort
of a complicated machinery, automatically,

67
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:52,942
spontaneously in a split of a second you know
that I’m standing before you and talking

68
00:08:52,942 --> 00:08:53,942
to you.

69
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:55,512
Such a computer we can not create.

70
00:08:55,512 --> 00:09:01,192
But the Divine has created such a great computer
and that is the humane being.

71
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:07,211
And this humane being is the only one who
is going to achieve that higher state, which

72
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:12,302
we call as the spiritual state of the Self.

73
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:20,611
Because in the science they deal with the
tree, I should say, the outside, but they

74
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:24,202
can not go into the roots.

75
00:09:24,202 --> 00:09:28,652
To go into the roots you have to become a
subtler being.

76
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:32,461
Unless and until you become a subtler being
you can not go into your roots to find out

77
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:34,772
what are your roots are.

78
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:38,022
And that is what is Self-Realization.

79
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:45,512
When you become subtler then only you can
go into your being and can find out what actually

80
00:09:45,512 --> 00:09:46,512
you are.

81
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:55,282
Also to look after a tree, which has not know
its roots, is a very difficult thing.

82
00:09:55,282 --> 00:10:02,032
What happens is that when you do not know
your roots and you start growing, and growing,

83
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:12,212
and growing you go very deep down into that
where you find that you have lost your way.

84
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:13,512
Actually you are not going deeper.

85
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:17,842
You are spreading outside more and more.

86
00:10:17,842 --> 00:10:22,412
And then once you start going to extremes
because of your freedom you lose your way.

87
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:28,592
That’s how today everybody is saying, “A
shock is going to come”.

88
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:31,692
You are all going to face a shock.

89
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:34,722
This is going to happen, that is going to
happen.

90
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:40,182
But actually it is absolutely in your hands
because the whole of the cosmos is within

91
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,182
you.

92
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:45,902
The cosmos is working under your control complete.

93
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:49,721
It is absolutely looking after you.

94
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:58,312
Every element is looking after you to preserve
you, to guide you, to take you to the right

95
00:10:58,312 --> 00:10:59,312
thinking.

96
00:10:59,312 --> 00:11:01,592
But in your freedom you have to achieve that.

97
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:06,922
This is a very big condition and there where
we fail to understand.

98
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:11,751
Even there are many who say, “There is nothing
like Divine” and, “There is nothing like

99
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:13,981
God.”

100
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:18,341
In Russia I’ve been and I’ve been to China
and all the communist countries and they are

101
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:21,602
in a way partially justify it.

102
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:29,122
Because what they found, those people who
talk of God, those who say that, “We believe

103
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:36,922
in God” and those who say that, “We believe
in religion”, can be irreligious.

104
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:42,832
Anybody who can call himself a Christian,
Hindu, Muslim, say, Farsi, anything, is capable

105
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:44,152
of any sin.

106
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:48,192
Whatever he wants to do he can do it.

107
00:11:48,192 --> 00:11:54,342
Nobody can say that, “Because he was a Christian
he could not do it”.

108
00:11:54,342 --> 00:12:03,582
So the whole concept of religion becomes a
mental projection again an artificial thing.

109
00:12:03,582 --> 00:12:13,682
But if a person is a Self-Realized person
he goes beyond that, beyond temptations, beyond

110
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:17,282
any kind of domination of any habits.

111
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:25,102
He becomes a very strong person, very powerful
person and extremely compassionate.

112
00:12:25,102 --> 00:12:29,732
His compassion is active.

113
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:34,192
Is not a compassion that, “I’ll form a
charitable institution, which lends money

114
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:38,162
to people”, is not like that.

115
00:12:38,162 --> 00:12:46,112
The being itself emits compassion and this
compassion acts, acts and works out.

116
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:52,352
For example you become like a light which
gives light to people and to yourself.

117
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:54,202
You know others and you know yourself.

118
00:12:54,202 --> 00:13:00,162
That is the light of the Truth and unless
and until that happens one should not say

119
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:08,142
that, “I’m a Self-Realized soul” or,
“I am a twice born” – is artificial.

120
00:13:08,142 --> 00:13:15,402
So what you have to understand that we are
living in a relative world.

121
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:18,482
We talk relatively.

122
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:24,542
We have to be in the absolute world, where
the Truth is absolute.

123
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:30,371
There now before you I’m standing, you know
very well that I’m wearing a sari, which

124
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:31,601
is white.

125
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:37,432
But it’s a relative still because somebody
will say, “Oh, maybe it’s white”.

126
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:41,972
Somebody will say, “It’s of white”,
somebody will say like that.

127
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:52,221
Still you know something, but to know it absolutely,
meticulously the right thing, you have to

128
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:53,221
be the Spirit.

129
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:58,922
But what you know is much more than these
eyes can see or this nose can smell.

130
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:07,912
Is much more, much more explicit, much more
clear cut.

131
00:14:07,912 --> 00:14:10,822
Like a person who is suffering, say, from
some disease.

132
00:14:10,822 --> 00:14:19,152
A child is suffering from some disease and
they don’t know what the disease is.

133
00:14:19,152 --> 00:14:26,402
So they have to go many various kinds of tests
and for that the gentlemen, the father, or

134
00:14:26,402 --> 00:14:29,232
the mother, they have to pay a lot of money.

135
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:32,842
They go on finding about the child, what’s
wrong, what’s wrong, what’s wrong.

136
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:35,052
They can not find it, what’s wrong with
the child.

137
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:40,912
And they are so upset about it and within
three days a child dies and still the diagnoses

138
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:41,912
is not coming.

139
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:45,952
Is a very common thing.

140
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:52,342
But when you are a Self-Realized soul you
can know what’s wrong with the child, exactly

141
00:14:52,342 --> 00:15:00,312
you can put down your finger on the problem
that he has.

142
00:15:00,312 --> 00:15:01,312
Now how does it happen?

143
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:06,312
Here is already told you about the charkas
that we have, the centers within us.

144
00:15:06,312 --> 00:15:13,652
These are the centers, which on one side control
the cosmos, on the other side control us,

145
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:19,432
give knowledge and on the other side they
give us the knowledge about others.

146
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:20,832
These centers are within us.

147
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:27,101
Now when I’m telling you all this you have
to have an open mind of a scientist.

148
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:31,682
We shouldn’t just deny it because in your
concept it doesn’t fitting.

149
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:38,472
But like a scientist please see to it that
if it is proved you have to accept that this

150
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:40,402
is so.

151
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:46,692
Now these charkas are within you, these centers
are within you, and these centers communicate

152
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:53,981
to you through your fingertips what’s the
matter with a child.

153
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:59,372
You can feel it on your fingertips, now five,
six, and seven centers, right side, seven

154
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:00,372
centers.

155
00:16:00,372 --> 00:16:01,522
(Shri Mataji points to the chakra projections
on Her left and right palms.)

156
00:16:01,522 --> 00:16:05,652
The right side has got the seven centers,
if they are decoded properly and if you know

157
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:09,972
what is the decoding is, putting the hand
towards a child, for a Realized soul it is

158
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:11,342
very easy to see where is the problem.

159
00:16:11,342 --> 00:16:18,851
And as soon as he finds a problem and he knows
how to cure it he can cure people without

160
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:19,851
going to doctors.

161
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:26,302
Sahaja Yoga has cured, I must say, I don’t
want to claim it because I don’t want to

162
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:29,922
open a hospital.

163
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,722
We are here to create doctors and not patients.

164
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:38,452
So even some patients who have come to us
have become doctors today in a way that they

165
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:41,412
diagnose it on their fingertips.

166
00:16:41,412 --> 00:16:49,122
As Mohammed Sahib has clearly said that, “At
the time of your resurrection your hands will

167
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:50,122
speak”.

168
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:56,172
But still nobody wants to know about it, that’s
called as a resurrection time, as [SOUNDS

169
00:16:56,172 --> 00:16:58,172
LIKE – Kayama], nobody wants to talk about
it.

170
00:16:58,172 --> 00:17:03,442
“Your hands will speak and will give evidence
and witness against you”, clearly He has

171
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:11,692
said it, I must say, He’d done such a lot
of work on the Self-knowledge; as Christ has

172
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:15,272
also said so many things.

173
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:18,282
But people don’t want to look at that side.

174
00:17:18,282 --> 00:17:26,952
Like to say that, “We must suffer” itself
is a nonsense, I think, how can you.

175
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:34,231
Any God who is a compassionate Father would
like His children to suffer to meet Him?

176
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:37,851
I mean, it doesn’t going to logic at all.

177
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:42,542
But people accept this funny concept of sufferings.

178
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:43,722
What about Christ?

179
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:46,012
He suffered for us, isn’t it?

180
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:49,732
Isn’t it that He suffered for us?

181
00:17:49,732 --> 00:17:55,092
If so, is has He left something for us to
be done, to be completed more than He has

182
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:58,091
suffered?

183
00:17:58,091 --> 00:18:08,812
He has suffered for us and He has done the
job fully.

184
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:15,482
We don’t have to do any more about it.

185
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:18,702
He carried the cross.

186
00:18:18,702 --> 00:18:24,522
People make Him look like a TB patient, even
worse than that, just bones and the skins.

187
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:31,332
It’s very surprising, how can you conceive
Christ like that?!

188
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:40,741
Anyone of the people who say they are very
healthy people, let them carry the cross and

189
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:42,461
we’ll see.

190
00:18:42,461 --> 00:18:51,721
It is so contradictory about Christ, there’s
surprisingly that He should say that you have

191
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:55,042
to suffer.

192
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:56,042
Same about Jews.

193
00:18:56,042 --> 00:19:03,342
I just don’t understand why should they
say that you have to suffer if their God is

194
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,342
kind?

195
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:12,062
Same about all other organized; all these
organized or perverted people who say that

196
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:14,532
you have to suffer.

197
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:18,242
Suddenly people become vegetarians, suddenly
they become fasting.

198
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:22,742
In India though we have to fast in any case
because of lack of food, but they have fasting

199
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:23,742
days.

200
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:27,672
There are some people who fast at least five
days in a week.

201
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:28,672
They fasting.

202
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:29,672
What is the need to fast?

203
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:31,712
If you ask for fasting you’ll have to fast
all your life.

204
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,032
That’s what God gives you, “You fast now,
you want to fast?

205
00:19:35,032 --> 00:19:37,652
All right, have it fasting.”

206
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:40,372
We are asking for trouble.

207
00:19:40,372 --> 00:19:41,782
You want to be miserable?

208
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:44,802
All right, be miserable.

209
00:19:44,802 --> 00:19:45,852
You want to be unhappy?

210
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,972
All right, be unhappy.

211
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:54,642
You find people coming out of congregations,
which are supposed to be very religious so

212
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:56,152
miserable looking.

213
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:57,422
How can it be?

214
00:19:57,422 --> 00:20:03,642
It has to be joy, it has to be happiness.

215
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:09,982
Just think of it, how can we ever believe
such things what we have believed for ages,

216
00:20:09,982 --> 00:20:16,342
ages, ages, and it can not go out of our heads,
that we have to suffer.

217
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:21,162
How long, how many years, how many lives?

218
00:20:21,162 --> 00:20:23,162
Nothing is written anywhere.

219
00:20:23,162 --> 00:20:29,182
You better go on suffering and make others
suffer also with it.

220
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:34,652
If some person is like that in your family
you’d like to run away with that boredom,

221
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:37,502
because he’s suffering for nothing at all
and (Shri Mataji laughs) he don’t understand

222
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,702
why is he suffering.

223
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:41,562
So you want to run away from such a person.

224
00:20:41,562 --> 00:20:48,012
And all this kind of ideas we have accepted
for ages now.

225
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:51,592
And that has led us to a big confusion about
God.

226
00:20:51,592 --> 00:20:56,012
Then we take to things which give us joy.

227
00:20:56,012 --> 00:21:01,692
Actually they are not, they are just flippant
pleasures.

228
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:04,703
We can not enjoy anything in life, really
we can not.

229
00:21:04,703 --> 00:21:09,062
We can see the way people are now going on
for such sensational things.

230
00:21:09,062 --> 00:21:11,142
The reason is there’s no joy.

231
00:21:11,142 --> 00:21:17,972
The sensitivity to joy is so reduced that
I sometimes fear with all that they are doing

232
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:23,132
they so fed up, that they may have to put
electrodes in the limbic area to get the joy

233
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:25,642
instead.

234
00:21:25,642 --> 00:21:34,662
They have become so very (Shri Mataji smiles)
so very insensitive to anything, they’ll

235
00:21:34,662 --> 00:21:42,572
not laugh, they’ll not smile, they are so
full of closed hearts and frightened things,

236
00:21:42,572 --> 00:21:45,202
whatever they said about humane beings.

237
00:21:45,202 --> 00:21:56,132
Now first thing you have to know – you don’t
have to suffer at all.

238
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:57,622
Secondly, you don’t have to judge yourself.

239
00:21:57,622 --> 00:21:59,732
Let your Kundalini rise and judge you.

240
00:21:59,732 --> 00:22:01,192
You don’t start judging yourself and condemning
yourself.

241
00:22:01,192 --> 00:22:07,362
And the another fashion, which is very common,
is to feel guilty.

242
00:22:07,362 --> 00:22:11,972
From the very beginning you start, “I am
afraid”.

243
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:15,022
What are you afraid of?

244
00:22:15,022 --> 00:22:22,242
You have to have all the courage, all the
blessings, and all the confidence.

245
00:22:22,242 --> 00:22:28,922
You are a humane being and this is the message
I want to tell you that you are a humane being

246
00:22:28,922 --> 00:22:31,022
and you have to be the Spirit.

247
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:35,712
And once you are the Spirit you’ll be surprised
the blessings will be showering upon you.

248
00:22:35,712 --> 00:22:39,652
In these modern times should talk about these
things is out of date.

249
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:44,032
But it is predicted that this will be said
and this will be done.

250
00:22:44,032 --> 00:22:52,822
For us it is important first of all to know
our own glory, our own truths, and about how

251
00:22:52,822 --> 00:22:56,232
we are built and how others are built.

252
00:22:56,232 --> 00:23:02,062
Once you know that first of all the peace
within is established.

253
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:08,202
Unless and until there is peace within what
do you talk of this peace organization and

254
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:10,092
Peace Nobel Prize?

255
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:19,792
I’ve seen the people who have gotten Nobel
Prizes are the most hot-headed so much that

256
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:24,242
you have to talk to them with a barge pole
in between.

257
00:23:24,242 --> 00:23:29,522
Any time they are up to jump on you, you can
not challenge them; even talking to them is

258
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:31,792
a difficult situation.

259
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:38,412
So how are they going to have this peace foundation
when they are themselves so shaking?

260
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:43,872
Then you have other things talking about – the
love, the love.

261
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,092
Full of lust and greed.

262
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:51,712
They love your purse, not you.

263
00:23:51,712 --> 00:23:58,542
When you talk of love, love is a thing that’s
detached.

264
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:06,032
Like the sap in the tree rises, goes to all
the leaves, all the trunk, all the flowers,

265
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:08,712
all the fruits and comes back, is not attached.

266
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:17,292
If it’s get attached to one fruit the tree
will die and the fruit will die too.

267
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:24,472
So this Pure Love or the Divine Love is detached,
that’s why it acts, it works.

268
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:33,592
A person who is a Realized soul is such a
pure personality that even a glance of such

269
00:24:33,592 --> 00:24:37,292
a person can do lots of things.

270
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:45,432
Even a thought of such a person in the attention
can do so many things, bring about so many

271
00:24:45,432 --> 00:24:46,432
changes.

272
00:24:46,432 --> 00:24:49,642
So this is the time of our transformation.

273
00:24:49,642 --> 00:24:58,272
We have to become a higher personality; the
transformation has to take place.

274
00:24:58,272 --> 00:25:03,912
At the time of Easter we give people eggs.

275
00:25:03,912 --> 00:25:09,112
Perhaps people do not know why do we give
them eggs at the time of Easter.

276
00:25:09,112 --> 00:25:14,632
But about Christ is written in our Scriptures
that He was an egg to begin with.

277
00:25:14,632 --> 00:25:21,522
Of course, He was much more before that, but
to begin with He was the God of innocence.

278
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:26,242
But then He came as an egg.

279
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:29,122
And then He was divided into two halves.

280
00:25:29,122 --> 00:25:36,962
The one half, which incarnated, and which
transformed this Earth.

281
00:25:36,962 --> 00:25:40,282
So the resurrection is the transformation.

282
00:25:40,282 --> 00:25:49,812
Like an egg, if we are bound by our conditioning
and by our ego, we break through that shell

283
00:25:49,812 --> 00:25:52,862
and become a bird, which is really a free
bird.

284
00:25:52,862 --> 00:25:56,102
Only thing, the bird has to know how to fly.

285
00:25:56,102 --> 00:26:04,182
Now this is, again I’m saying is the living
process of the living nature, of the living

286
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:05,562
Power of Love.

287
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:08,062
It is not something artificial.

288
00:26:08,062 --> 00:26:15,822
In Sahaja Yoga, I must have spoken in this
hall I don’t know how many times might before

289
00:26:15,822 --> 00:26:19,872
and again today there’s a chance to speak
to you.

290
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:25,062
What I have to say, that it is important the
becoming.

291
00:26:25,062 --> 00:26:31,272
Is not important: you can not become a member
of Sahaj Yog, you can not pay membership,

292
00:26:31,272 --> 00:26:32,912
you can not pay for your Realization.

293
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:33,922
How can you pay?

294
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:40,342
How much do we pay to the Mother Earth to
sprout the seed, does She understand?

295
00:26:40,342 --> 00:26:45,692
Because She has the power She sprouts the
seed.

296
00:26:45,692 --> 00:26:53,372
If you give Her money or read something before
Her, it makes no difference.

297
00:26:53,372 --> 00:26:58,782
But once you get your Realization you start
understanding how many powers you have.

298
00:26:58,782 --> 00:27:05,972
And the greatest power is of compassion and
detached love.

299
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:10,782
These seven chakras are within us, which are
to be enlightened by the awakening of the

300
00:27:10,782 --> 00:27:14,262
Kundalini about which Dr. Spiro has already
told you.

301
00:27:14,262 --> 00:27:18,872
Now in this short time I can not cover up
the whole subject.

302
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:23,442
I must have given at least more than thousand
lectures in English language.

303
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:31,312
But I would request you one thing that forget
about what you have learned so far.

304
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:39,162
About your conditionings because if you had
achieved anything out of that I was not necessary.

305
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:48,242
Now you have to see with a clean slate, as
they say, what you can achieve in this lifetime,

306
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:52,112
which is the most important thing, is to be
achieved.

307
00:27:52,112 --> 00:28:01,482
Of course, where’s a lot of things that
should really make you more tempting about

308
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:02,532
it.

309
00:28:02,532 --> 00:28:06,042
Firstly, that you get rid of all your illnesses.

310
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:14,152
Most of the illnesses can be cured – if
they are at an early stage – by Sahaja Yoga.

311
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:20,402
Most of the mental illnesses can be cured
with Sahaja Yoga.

312
00:28:20,402 --> 00:28:25,462
Your material problems can be solved by Sahaja
Yoga.

313
00:28:25,462 --> 00:28:30,572
Your spiritual problems like going to wrong
gurus and wrong people whatever you have accumulated

314
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:32,522
within you can be corrected.

315
00:28:32,522 --> 00:28:39,752
But the highest of all that you become sensitive
to joy.

316
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:42,362
Then you start seeing joy in everything.

317
00:28:42,362 --> 00:28:46,842
You don’t have to think that, “Oh, this
is the thing which is marvelous”.

318
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:47,842
No.

319
00:28:47,842 --> 00:28:51,762
It just happens, you see it is.

320
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:56,412
Just you enjoy without thinking about it.

321
00:28:56,412 --> 00:28:58,422
You become a peaceful personality.

322
00:28:58,422 --> 00:29:00,842
You become a dynamic personality.

323
00:29:00,842 --> 00:29:07,492
Your are not spade by other veils of things,
like some fashion coming up, then some sort

324
00:29:07,492 --> 00:29:12,952
of a nonsensical idea coming up, then some
medicine coming up and you treating yourself

325
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:14,822
and getting to trouble.

326
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:19,122
You just rise above all the these things at
a higher level and you start see everything

327
00:29:19,122 --> 00:29:21,112
as a witness.

328
00:29:21,112 --> 00:29:27,392
You become the witness of all the jokes that
are going on and you just watch it and you

329
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:30,072
think, “What’s all this?

330
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:32,862
Is just a play”.

331
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:37,592
Many people have said that, “Mother, You
always laugh so much and You have always smiling

332
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:40,422
face, so the people are not going to take
You seriously”.

333
00:29:40,422 --> 00:29:43,732
I said, “I don’t want them to be serious”.

334
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:45,112
There’s not going to be any seriousness
needed.

335
00:29:45,112 --> 00:29:47,942
What are you serious about?

336
00:29:47,942 --> 00:29:50,252
You should be happy.

337
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:51,342
It’s fun.

338
00:29:51,342 --> 00:29:53,552
We have to be happy people.

339
00:29:53,552 --> 00:29:54,562
We have to be happy.

340
00:29:54,562 --> 00:30:00,622
Most people who think, they are very guilty,
should punish themselves by saying, “You

341
00:30:00,622 --> 00:30:03,032
are not guilty, you are not guilty” 108
times.

342
00:30:03,032 --> 00:30:06,082
That’s what we have in Sahaja Yoga.

343
00:30:06,082 --> 00:30:07,082
Is just the myth.

344
00:30:07,082 --> 00:30:12,802
All these are myths; we are working with myths
and making our lives miserable, which is meant

345
00:30:12,802 --> 00:30:20,482
to be joy, happiness and all the overflowing
blessings of the Divine.

346
00:30:20,482 --> 00:30:28,592
Whatever I’m telling you about we have within
ourselves all the great powers hidden of our

347
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:35,162
brain, of our liver, of our heart, – they
are to be enlightened.

348
00:30:35,162 --> 00:30:36,202
And then in the light you see everything.

349
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:42,952
But as in this room you have so many lights
you have to just push in one button and the

350
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:44,002
whole thing comes out.

351
00:30:44,002 --> 00:30:45,682
In the same way it happens.

352
00:30:45,682 --> 00:30:51,112
But if I start telling you about the history
of electricity in the dark and all about how

353
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:56,512
it came here and what all happened, you’d
be just fed up with it.

354
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:02,012
So what we are doing is to tell you that let
us put on the button first, you better have

355
00:31:02,012 --> 00:31:06,292
your light and see in that light if it is
true or not.

356
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:11,882
If it is true you have to understand and accept
it honestly.

357
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:17,002
You have to be honest to yourself that is
the main point I’m trying to tell you.

358
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:21,312
We are not to play about with ourselves and
play about with our conditionings.

359
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:26,702
We have to be honest and to get to our properties
that are within our selves.

360
00:31:26,702 --> 00:31:30,102
I’m not here to oblige you at all, there’s
no obligation.

361
00:31:30,102 --> 00:31:35,762
Is just like a catalyst, I would say, and
you become the catalyst oneself once you get

362
00:31:35,762 --> 00:31:36,872
your Realization.

363
00:31:36,872 --> 00:31:43,112
And you can do all that I can do, it’s very
easy and very simple.

364
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:47,222
May God bless you all.

365
00:31:47,222 --> 00:31:48,222
(Aside) Now, should we have questions or what?

366
00:31:48,222 --> 00:31:49,222
I find most of you were just ready for getting
Self-Realization.

367
00:31:49,222 --> 00:31:51,792
Not only that, but I think you all capable
of that.

368
00:31:51,792 --> 00:32:39,772
But still there must be some people who must
be want to ask questions.

369
00:32:39,772 --> 00:32:44,332
I would only request – don’t be aggressive
with Me, there’s no need.

370
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:50,702
I’ve not come here for votes, nor for any
money, nor for anything.

371
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:55,522
I’ve just come here to give you your own
keys.

372
00:32:55,522 --> 00:32:58,872
Out of Love that I am.

373
00:32:58,872 --> 00:33:02,652
So please try to understand Me.

374
00:33:02,652 --> 00:33:07,672
I’m not here to take, I mean, anything from
you.

375
00:33:07,672 --> 00:33:14,802
Just to show you what you are and you’ll
be happy to know that you are something great.

376
00:33:14,802 --> 00:33:22,652
So may God bless you, I would like you to
ask Me questions related to Self-Realization

377
00:33:22,652 --> 00:33:27,742
and not to waste the time of so many who look
so anxious to have their Self-Realization.

378
00:33:27,742 --> 00:33:35,782
Those who do not want to do any meditation
after this, which will take hardly ten minutes

379
00:33:35,782 --> 00:33:40,601
for you to get your Realization, because the
journey is three to four feet only – from

380
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:41,601
here to here.

381
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:44,922
(Shri Mataji shows the distance from Mooladhar
to Sahasrara Chakra with Her hand.)

382
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:45,922
That’s all.

383
00:33:45,922 --> 00:33:50,462
So, I would just say, that you will all get
your Realization in no time.

384
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:55,882
Should get your Realization, but do not try
to be uncivil.

385
00:33:55,882 --> 00:34:00,532
If you do not want to have it, you should
leave the hall and leave others in peace.

386
00:34:00,532 --> 00:34:02,652
That would be very kind of us.

387
00:34:02,652 --> 00:34:07,422
And not to see and watch, we don’t need
such people here.

388
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:13,022
Those who want to have Realization can sit
down or others have freedom to go, but not

389
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:14,162
freedom to sit here.

390
00:34:14,162 --> 00:34:23,952
So I would request you to be kind and civil
to others who want to receive their Realization.

391
00:34:23,952 --> 00:34:28,432
Any questions, please.

392
00:34:28,432 --> 00:34:32,902
Q.: [NOT AUDIBLE]

393
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:35,892
What’s it?

394
00:34:35,892 --> 00:35:03,492
A Sahaja Yogi: Mother, he said that Dr. Spiro
couldn’t complete his talk about how the

395
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:06,382
germinating principle works.

396
00:35:06,382 --> 00:35:11,432
Could You say something to finish of what
he said?

397
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:13,351
Shri Mataji: Generating principle?

398
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:14,422
The Sahaja Yogi: Germinating.

399
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:17,172
Shri Mataji: You see, it is, I would say,
it is spontaneous.

400
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:28,602
Now that should explain a little bit how does
a seed germinate.

401
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:33,002
You have the seed and you put it in the Mother
Earth, all right?

402
00:35:33,002 --> 00:35:39,532
And it germinates because it’s all built
in it, this is all built in it, all this is

403
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:40,691
built in it.

404
00:35:40,691 --> 00:35:47,262
And in the triangular bone you have got this
Kundalini, which is placed within you in 3,5

405
00:35:47,262 --> 00:35:49,782
coils of an energy, which is a residual energy.

406
00:35:49,782 --> 00:35:58,932
Which is actually the power of your pure desire.

407
00:35:58,932 --> 00:36:03,752
Because the desire that we have otherwise,
all the desires, are not pure.

408
00:36:03,752 --> 00:36:07,552
What’s why they are not satiable in general.

409
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,762
We get one thing, we want to have another.

410
00:36:09,762 --> 00:36:12,701
We get the another thing, you want to have
the third thing.

411
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:18,121
So this is the power of pure desire.

412
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:27,411
And this pure desire is described in the Bible
as Holy Ghost, in the Koran as [SOUNDS LIKE

413
00:36:27,411 --> 00:36:36,722
– Asas] and in the Indian Scriptures as
Adi Shakti, as the Primordial Mother.

414
00:36:36,722 --> 00:36:42,922
So She is the power of God as called as the
Primordial Mother.

415
00:36:42,922 --> 00:36:50,911
Now this Primordial Mother is settled in our
triangular bone while the Spirit which is

416
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:54,682
the reflection of God Almighty is in our heart.

417
00:36:54,682 --> 00:37:04,142
But the seat of the heart is on top of your
head – here – on the fontanel bone area,

418
00:37:04,142 --> 00:37:07,702
which is called as Brahmarandra in Sanskrit
language.

419
00:37:07,702 --> 00:37:14,782
And also when we talk of baptism we try to
bless there, but it’s artificial.

420
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:23,172
Real baptism is when this Kundalini, which
is the Holy Ghost or the Adi Shakti, the reflection

421
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:30,362
of that, rises within you piercing through
these centers, piercing through the fontanel

422
00:37:30,362 --> 00:37:39,042
bone area and actualizes the experience of
this personal experience and gives you a cool

423
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:41,032
breeze coming out of your head.

424
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:45,172
Actually the cool breeze coming out of your
head, you feel it, and then you feel it everywhere,

425
00:37:45,172 --> 00:37:49,182
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

426
00:37:49,182 --> 00:37:57,062
And that is the subtle of the subtlest, which
is the syntheses of all the powers, which

427
00:37:57,062 --> 00:37:59,512
works everything out.

428
00:37:59,512 --> 00:38:06,752
Like you can say, in the sulfur dioxide we
have in the molecule of the sulfur dioxide

429
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:09,272
we find that there is pulsation of the vibrations.

430
00:38:09,272 --> 00:38:11,882
Who does what?

431
00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:13,942
We say electromagnetic.

432
00:38:13,942 --> 00:38:18,392
But the electromagnetic is one part of the
same power.

433
00:38:18,392 --> 00:38:22,342
So this power we can broadly divide into three
things.

434
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:28,202
In the first power what we call as the power
by which we desire.

435
00:38:28,202 --> 00:38:36,692
The second power by which we act and the third
power by which we ascend.

436
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:48,112
All the synthesis of all these powers, all
these powers are in this Kundalini which meets

437
00:38:48,112 --> 00:38:54,072
the Spirit because the seat of the Spirit,
as they call the Pitha, is on top of your

438
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:59,642
head and that’s how the whole attention
you can see like a sari it is supposing the

439
00:38:59,642 --> 00:39:04,401
attention is spread here and the Kundalini
rises, rises like that (Shri Mataji puts Her

440
00:39:04,401 --> 00:39:06,173
finger under the sari on Her chest and erects
it like a tent pole), pierces through this

441
00:39:06,173 --> 00:39:08,972
at and the whole of this attention becomes
enlightened.

442
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:12,492
That’s how your attention becomes enlightened.

443
00:39:12,492 --> 00:39:14,242
This is in short I’m telling you.

444
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:20,942
But as I told you we have got My lectures
on all detailed way how it works out, it’s

445
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,202
quite a detailed thing.

446
00:39:22,202 --> 00:39:25,332
But in the first lecture it will be quite
boring for you.

447
00:39:25,332 --> 00:39:30,532
So I think I better tell you this much, that
it’s a spontaneous happening and can happen

448
00:39:30,532 --> 00:39:53,632
to all of you.

449
00:39:53,632 --> 00:40:10,952
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

450
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:11,952
The Sahaja Yogi: Do the first stages in Sahaja
Yoga consist of meditation and how they beneficial

451
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:12,952
physiological changes?

452
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,312
Shri Mataji: No, it is, you see, we do not
understand the meaning of meditation actually.

453
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:19,982
You are not to meditate, but you are in meditation
in Sahaja Yoga.

454
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,902
You become meditative by temperament.

455
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:27,322
Now, I would suggest like this that in the
beginning why I said you have to meditate,

456
00:40:27,322 --> 00:40:31,992
because I would like to tell you actually
that word is not so suitable, but I said that

457
00:40:31,992 --> 00:40:39,042
you have to little bit cooperate with Me how
to help your Kundalini to rise.

458
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:44,262
That’s the process we are going to have
in a very simple words.

459
00:40:44,262 --> 00:40:49,462
But I said meditate because that’s all could
make the smaller way of saying things.

460
00:40:49,462 --> 00:40:55,492
But actually in Sahaja Yoga the practice of
Sahaja Yoga is very different from any kind

461
00:40:55,492 --> 00:40:59,072
of meditation, of concentration or anything.

462
00:40:59,072 --> 00:41:05,312
There are very simple ways by which you have
to correct your left or right side and to

463
00:41:05,312 --> 00:41:07,901
be in the center.

464
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:10,732
And then when you are in the center the growth
take place.

465
00:41:10,732 --> 00:41:17,062
Is very simple and luckily we are going to
have next Thursday a very good workshop where

466
00:41:17,062 --> 00:41:20,352
they will tell you all the details how it
has to be done.

467
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:24,462
And they’ll solve all your questions and
all your problems there.

468
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:31,642
And lots of people are going to be in that
place where you’ll find solutions to all

469
00:41:31,642 --> 00:41:39,332
these questions you ask.

470
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:58,552
Thursday they are going to have a very good
workshop.

471
00:41:58,552 --> 00:42:04,322
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

472
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:19,472
Shri Mataji: [YES or FIRST], sickness can
be cured if you become Self-Realized.

473
00:42:19,472 --> 00:42:23,832
Actually you don’t go to doctors then anymore,
you become a doctor yourself.

474
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:28,312
So the physical sufferings can be, this [NOT
AUDIBLE – way ?]. Now the collective suffering

475
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:34,222
comes by the stupidity of humane beings, by
the ego of humane beings, of wrong ideas,

476
00:42:34,222 --> 00:42:35,302
you see.

477
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:41,362
Like a Hindu fighting a Sikh and a Muslim
fighting a Muslim and a Christian fighting

478
00:42:41,362 --> 00:42:44,312
the Jews or all the sorts of nonsense.

479
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:49,772
And also the capitalist fighting the communists.

480
00:42:49,772 --> 00:42:54,411
Actually I should say I’m a capitalist because
I have certain powers and I’m the greatest

481
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:55,612
communist because I must distribute it.

482
00:42:55,612 --> 00:42:59,332
This is the real power which has to be distributed.

483
00:42:59,332 --> 00:43:01,581
What is the money power to be distributed?

484
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:02,581
– Useless thing.

485
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,342
Money doesn’t give you any sense.

486
00:43:04,342 --> 00:43:10,351
So is the combination of everything, the synthesis
of everything you’ll find and that’s how

487
00:43:10,351 --> 00:43:14,282
you are surprised that the sufferings just
disappear.

488
00:43:14,282 --> 00:43:21,952
Also now you might say that, “What about
the sufferings of the nature?”

489
00:43:21,952 --> 00:43:30,122
People who are Realized souls never get those
suffering things because you see this full

490
00:43:30,122 --> 00:43:35,482
cosmos is within them, they are looked after.

491
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:39,122
This is at a humane awareness.

492
00:43:39,122 --> 00:43:43,151
But at the spiritual awareness you become
beyond sufferings.

493
00:43:43,151 --> 00:43:49,252
And Christ is to be awakened within you, that’s
the points is.

494
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:50,732
Because Christ is not awakened within you.

495
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:59,882
When the Christ, you know, in this chakra
– this center is Agya chakra, here – is

496
00:43:59,882 --> 00:44:02,662
bestowed the Deity of Christ.

497
00:44:02,662 --> 00:44:08,222
Now here if you can see in the map there is
they have shown on one side the ego, another

498
00:44:08,222 --> 00:44:11,612
side – the superego, means the conditioning.

499
00:44:11,612 --> 00:44:19,552
Now when this chakra is awakened meaning the
Christ within us is awakened, then He sucks

500
00:44:19,552 --> 00:44:20,812
in our karmas.

501
00:44:20,812 --> 00:44:25,402
That’s why they say that He died for our
sins.

502
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:31,392
Then He also sucks in our conditioning, both
the things.

503
00:44:31,392 --> 00:44:42,282
He is placed in the middle of the brain you
can say where is the optic chaisma crossing

504
00:44:42,282 --> 00:44:48,072
and He looks after the pituitary and the pineal
body.

505
00:44:48,072 --> 00:44:53,752
That’s how He controls both the things within
us and He sucks in.

506
00:44:53,752 --> 00:44:57,072
And when He sucks in there’s an opening
that takes place on our fontanel bone area

507
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:58,282
and through that then the Kundalini pierces
through.

508
00:44:58,282 --> 00:44:59,312
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

509
00:44:59,312 --> 00:45:10,342
The Sahaja Yogi: How can you keep your Self-Realization
if you are not in touch with the collective?

510
00:45:10,342 --> 00:45:26,164
Shri Mataji: You can not.

511
00:45:26,164 --> 00:45:28,332
You have to keep some connection with the
collective.

512
00:45:28,332 --> 00:45:31,082
It’s like say nowadays it’s autumn you
have seen.

513
00:45:31,082 --> 00:45:32,891
In autumn what happens?

514
00:45:32,891 --> 00:45:40,392
A bark like a cork develops between the leaves
and the tree.

515
00:45:40,392 --> 00:45:43,462
And such a leaf falls off and dies.

516
00:45:43,462 --> 00:45:48,302
You have to be in the collective, you can
not keep your Self-Realization without collectivity.

517
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:51,432
Is very important to be with the collective.

518
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:57,012
This is one point people fail, because they
think they’ll lose their individuality.

519
00:45:57,012 --> 00:45:58,682
Is a wrong idea.

520
00:45:58,682 --> 00:46:01,782
Actually when the leaf dies it has no individuality.

521
00:46:01,782 --> 00:46:07,651
On the contrary, when it is on the tree you’ll
be surprised, that one leaf can not tally

522
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:10,392
with another leaf in the whole world.

523
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:15,132
Such an individual thing it is.

524
00:46:15,132 --> 00:46:21,442
It is I would say unity in diversity, complete
unity in diversity.

525
00:46:21,442 --> 00:46:25,712
Because that is the variety is the one that
gives beauty to this world.

526
00:46:25,712 --> 00:46:30,612
Otherwise if we are all sort of dressed of
the same way, walking the same way, it will

527
00:46:30,612 --> 00:46:32,582
be such a boring company.

528
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:50,338
Is there any question?

529
00:46:50,363 --> 00:46:52,490
Such a rapport.

530
00:46:52,515 --> 00:46:53,982
It’s beautiful people today.

531
00:46:54,095 --> 00:46:54,838
All right.

532
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:59,275
So now, as I’ve requested you, those who
would like to go, should go.

533
00:46:59,377 --> 00:47:05,507
Because when we do this we all have to close
the eyes and people are not even willing to

534
00:47:05,507 --> 00:47:06,507
do that.

535
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:11,307
So the thing is that the Divine is not going
to fall at out feet, isn’t it?

536
00:47:11,307 --> 00:47:12,927
We have to be little humble about it.

537
00:47:12,927 --> 00:47:19,627
If we don’t have that humility is better
we should try other methods and then come

538
00:47:19,627 --> 00:47:20,967
to Sahaja Yoga.

539
00:47:20,967 --> 00:47:28,787
Because Sahaja Yoga is not meant for arrogant
people, for people who think knowing of themselves.

540
00:47:28,787 --> 00:47:41,297
Is meant for people who want to get their
Self-Realization.

541
00:47:41,297 --> 00:47:49,167
Now a simple thing we have to do, all of us,
which is also sometimes not liked by people

542
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:52,977
when I tell them – we have to take out our
shoes.

543
00:47:52,977 --> 00:47:56,427
Because this Mother Earth is going to help
us a lot.

544
00:47:56,427 --> 00:47:58,907
She’s the one who is giver of everything.

545
00:47:58,907 --> 00:48:02,576
So we have to take out our shoes and touch
the Mother Earth.

546
00:48:02,576 --> 00:48:16,847
You can keep your socks on with your both
the feet.

547
00:48:27,285 --> 00:48:34,599
Put both the feet separately because there
are two powers separately on the Mother Earth.

548
00:48:51,192 --> 00:48:56,527
Those who are sitting on the ground are all
right as they are, they need not put their

549
00:48:56,527 --> 00:49:06,437
feet like this, they can sit in a Sahaja asana,
means in a way that is relaxed, not to put

550
00:49:06,437 --> 00:49:08,897
legs on top of another row or anything.

551
00:49:08,897 --> 00:49:11,607
Any stress on your body is not needed.

552
00:49:11,607 --> 00:49:17,576
You have to be comfortable to be straight,
sitting straight, not putting your neck back

553
00:49:17,576 --> 00:49:27,296
or forward, just sitting straight, that’s
all.

554
00:49:27,296 --> 00:49:34,777
One promise has to be there in your heart,
that you will after Realization respect your

555
00:49:34,777 --> 00:49:43,487
Realization and grow like a tree and should
not be the like the parable of the seeds that

556
00:49:43,487 --> 00:49:50,027
some seeds fell on a rock and some who sprouted
also got lost.

557
00:49:50,027 --> 00:49:57,887
I would request you very-very earnestly and
with a great concern that you have to look

558
00:49:57,887 --> 00:50:01,517
after your Self-Realization and your growth.

559
00:50:01,517 --> 00:50:10,377
As we do not take any money from anyone, we
don’t have very elaborate places or elaborate

560
00:50:10,377 --> 00:50:15,277
centers, so whatever is available is there
for you.

561
00:50:15,277 --> 00:50:22,277
But that is God’s place and you have to
come there to get all the information, the

562
00:50:22,277 --> 00:50:26,857
knowledge about the Self.

563
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:39,707
I hope you will not treat it with just a side
issue, but the main object of your human

564
00:50:39,707 --> 00:50:41,469
ascent.

565
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:47,907
You don’t have to pay for it; you don’t
have to do anything else.

566
00:50:47,907 --> 00:50:58,027
Moreover, we are all the time trying to save
time and that is why the time has to be spent

567
00:50:58,027 --> 00:51:03,297
is been collective and enjoying the joy.

568
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:08,647
May God bless you all.

569
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:12,949
So both hands have to be like this, to begin
with.

570
00:51:14,117 --> 00:51:21,843
This is because as I told you these are all
sympathetic centers which are to be enlightened

571
00:51:21,843 --> 00:51:25,934
first of all, so the information goes to the
Kundalini that the Kundalini is to be awakened.

572
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,251
This is first thing we have to do.

573
00:51:28,276 --> 00:51:37,370
Now, secondly, we have to facilitate the movement
of the Kundalini even if she’s awakened.

574
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:45,830
And for that I will tell you how to put your
hand into various centers to the various centers

575
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:49,352
so that you can yourself facilitate.

576
00:51:49,377 --> 00:51:53,620
I would like one of you to get up and show
this better.

577
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,320
Yeah.

578
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:02,340
Now Dr. Spiro will show you also and I will
also that first you have to put your hand

579
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,100
to your heart where resides.

580
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:08,430
Now left hand towards Me and right hand on
the heart.

581
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:11,540
Left hand towards Me.

582
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:16,910
Now to your heart and here resides the Spirit.

583
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:23,380
We work only on the left hand side, because
that is the side of our desire and put the

584
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:30,880
left hand like this symbolically meaning that
this is the power of desire and we want to

585
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,970
have our Self-Realization, expression of that.

586
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:44,600
Now the second chakra is on the upper part
of your abdomen on the left hand side.

587
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:56,570
This is the center of your mastery by which
the mastery over this power of love or Divine

588
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:00,650
vibrations you achieve and manifest through
your being.

589
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:04,840
Is just starts working like through our eyes
we can see the light.

590
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:13,340
In the same way, once you become the master,
you can feel, you can know everything about

591
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,570
yourself and about others.

592
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:26,640
Then you have to take down your right hand
to the lower part of your abdomen.

593
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:36,790
This is the one, which is working out our
pure knowledge, knowledge, which is absolute

594
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,060
and pure.

595
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:44,810
This center is very important and by some
unauthorized people if some people have tamper

596
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:51,130
it we have to nourish it by putting our right
hand towards it.

597
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:58,860
Then again we go back into the upper part
of the abdomen.

598
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,380
Then we go back to our heart.

599
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:12,130
Now here we go back to the left hand side
of our neck, here, like this from front.

600
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,570
Many people tried this side (Shri Mataji pointed
to the back side of Her neck).

601
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:15,570
No.

602
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:21,040
You have to try from front and then turn your
head to your right, like this.

603
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:30,489
Now this center catches when we feel guilty
and now I find quite a lot catching in this

604
00:54:30,489 --> 00:54:31,489
audience.

605
00:54:31,489 --> 00:54:39,210
So please for the sake of your Self-Realization
forgive yourself, forgive yourself, forgive

606
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,210
yourself.

607
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:48,310
Now, please now stretch your hand like this
and put it on top of your forehead.

608
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:53,140
This is the center of forgiveness, – here.

609
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,700
And press it on both the sides, like this.

610
00:54:55,700 --> 00:55:04,322
Now you have to take this hand on the back,
rest your head on that, put the head up.

611
00:55:04,322 --> 00:55:16,030
And then you have to take out your hand again
and stretch it like this.

612
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:17,080
Fully stretched.

613
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:22,790
The center of your palm is to be placed on
top of the fontanel bone area.

614
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:25,240
You might bend your head a little, would be
better.

615
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:34,560
Just there, which was a soft bone in your
childhood, and you have to press your scalp

616
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:41,340
and move it about seven times slowly in a
clockwise manner.

617
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:52,940
That’s all we have to do.

618
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:58,530
But we must press it hard and the fingers
must be pushed back nicely so that we can

619
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:01,020
press our palm nicely.

620
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,270
All right.

621
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:06,530
That’s all is to be done.

622
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:10,090
[INAUDIBLE WORD – Principally ?]

623
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:12,239
Now we have to close our eyes.

624
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:15,870
Please don’t open your eyes till I’ll
tell you.

625
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:24,200
Because the attention will be attracted inside
and please you can take out your glasses.

626
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,790
The other day one lady who was quite blind
I think and she started seeing this, I mean,

627
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:33,239
you know, things happen like that.

628
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:35,960
I would request you to take out your glasses.

629
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:36,980
It helps you.

630
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:42,780
And you keep your eyes shut till I’ll tell
you, please don’t open your eyes.

631
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:51,510
It is how you are going to help yourself and
also you will know how to all the time raise

632
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,320
your Kundalini.

633
00:56:53,320 --> 00:57:00,560
It’s very simple method, which I’m telling
you.

634
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:07,430
Now, please put your left hand towards Me
like this and right hand on your heart.

635
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:13,979
Left hand towards Me and right hand on your
heart.

636
00:57:13,979 --> 00:57:17,260
Here, now close your eyes.

637
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:20,070
In the heart resides the Spirit.

638
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:25,530
So please ask Me question within yourself,
a very fundamental question, you can call

639
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:32,640
Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever you like,
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

640
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:37,469
Ask this question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

641
00:57:37,469 --> 00:57:44,715
Is a very fundamental question here to ask.

642
00:57:44,779 --> 00:57:50,249
Ask this question three times.

643
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:58,229
Now, if you are the Spirit, you are also your
guide and master.

644
00:57:58,229 --> 00:58:04,890
Please put your right hand in the upper part
of your abdomen on the left hand side, on

645
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:15,650
your stomach on the left hand side and press
it hard and ask a question here three times

646
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:20,020
again, “Mother, am I my own master?

647
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:23,700
Mother, am I my own master?

648
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,630
Mother, am I my own master?”

649
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:33,960
Ask this question in your heart.

650
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:50,270
Now, we move our right hand, move it down
into the lower part of your abdomen on the

651
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:51,450
left hand side.

652
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:58,860
Now here, please keep your eyes shut, please
keep your eyes shut and don’t move too much.

653
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:10,360
Here you have to know that I respect your
freedom and I can not force you to have the

654
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,450
pure knowledge.

655
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:15,270
You have to say that you want it.

656
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:26,636
So here you please say, “Mother, please
give me pure knowledge” six times, because

657
00:59:26,661 --> 00:59:29,336
this center has got six petals.

658
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:39,261
So please say six times, “Mother, please
give me pure knowledge”.

659
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:53,856
With this asking the Kundalini starts rising,
because she knows you want it.

660
00:59:54,142 --> 01:00:03,860
Now to facilitate her movement we go back
to the higher chakra and take our hand to

661
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:09,633
the upper part of the abdomen on the left
hand side and press it hard.

662
01:00:09,658 --> 01:00:21,001
Now, with full confidence we have to say ten
times, “Mother, I am my own master”.

663
01:00:21,026 --> 01:00:28,197
Say it with full confidence so the Kundalini
will rise, “Mother, I am my own master”.

664
01:00:28,284 --> 01:00:32,580
Please say it ten times.

665
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:45,407
This will correct your spiritual domination
if somebody has dominated you spiritually

666
01:00:45,432 --> 01:00:50,312
in the sense that they have misguided you
spiritually.

667
01:00:50,312 --> 01:00:55,142
“I am my own master”.

668
01:00:55,142 --> 01:01:11,582
Now, raise your right hand to the heart.

669
01:01:11,607 --> 01:01:15,887
Here resides the Spirit.

670
01:01:18,412 --> 01:01:34,002
So with full confidence say twelve times,
“Mother, I am the Spirit”.

671
01:01:34,002 --> 01:01:35,538
Have confidence in yourself.

672
01:01:35,563 --> 01:01:44,460
We have to know, that the Divine is the ocean
of love and compassion.

673
01:01:44,485 --> 01:01:54,032
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness
and we can not commit any mistakes, which

674
01:01:54,032 --> 01:01:59,082
the Divine can not forgive.

675
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:10,917
So please forgive yourself, forgive yourself
fully, and raise your right hand in the corner

676
01:02:10,942 --> 01:02:17,211
of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your
head to the right.

677
01:02:17,236 --> 01:02:29,222
And here with full confidence you say sixteen
times, “Mother, I am not guilty at all”.

678
01:02:29,222 --> 01:02:35,182
Please say it, very important and as I said,
if you still feel guilty, you can punish yourself

679
01:02:35,182 --> 01:02:38,322
by saying it hundred and eight times.

680
01:02:38,347 --> 01:02:45,028
You have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself
because you are going to enter into the Kingdom

681
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,290
of God.

682
01:02:50,678 --> 01:02:55,953
You have to love yourself and respect yourself.

683
01:02:56,247 --> 01:03:17,877
Sixteen times please say it.

684
01:03:22,751 --> 01:03:31,461
Now raise your hand and put it on your forehead
across.

685
01:03:31,461 --> 01:03:36,461
Put it on your forehead across.

686
01:03:36,461 --> 01:03:40,661
This is the center of forgiveness.

687
01:03:40,661 --> 01:03:52,345
So please here
you have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone”,

688
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,140
from your heart.

689
01:03:55,411 --> 01:03:59,791
You might say it is difficult, but it is a
myth.

690
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:04,280
Whether you forgive or you do not forgive
you do not do anything.

691
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,010
But if you do not forgive then you play into
wrong hands.

692
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:15,250
So to get over all the loads you just say
from your heart, “Mother, I forgive everyone”.

693
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:20,280
It’s not important how many times.

694
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:25,851
Press it on both the sides please.

695
01:04:25,851 --> 01:04:43,116
Now take back your hand, and put your hand
on the back of your head, and raise your head

696
01:04:43,155 --> 01:04:44,187
on that.

697
01:04:44,417 --> 01:04:47,111
Move your head upward.

698
01:04:47,111 --> 01:04:56,051
Now here for your own satisfaction only, without
counting any mistakes or guilt you can say,

699
01:04:56,051 --> 01:05:03,681
“Oh, Divine, if I have made any mistakes,
please forgive me”.

700
01:05:03,681 --> 01:05:08,050
For your own satisfaction, don’t feel guilty
about it.

701
01:05:08,075 --> 01:05:11,764
In a very pleasant manner.

702
01:05:17,571 --> 01:05:32,530
Now stretch your hand fully, push back your
fingers, and put the center of your palm on

703
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:42,851
top of the fontanel bone area, and now start
moving it very slowly, very slowly clockwise

704
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:43,931
the scalp.

705
01:05:43,931 --> 01:05:46,541
Press it hard, push back your fingers.

706
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:47,541
Seven times.

707
01:05:47,541 --> 01:05:54,581
At this point I must say that I can not force
again the Self-Realization upon you.

708
01:05:54,581 --> 01:05:56,861
I respect your freedom.

709
01:05:56,861 --> 01:05:58,551
You have to ask for it.

710
01:05:58,551 --> 01:06:08,190
So please say seven times, “Mother, please
give me my Realization, give me my Self-Realization”.

711
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:11,339
Or, “May I have my Self-Realization”.

712
01:06:12,712 --> 01:07:14,291
(Shri Mataji is blowing in the microphone
7 times.)

713
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:20,780
Now please take down your hands.

714
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:28,270
Please open your eyes very slowly.

715
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:30,701
Now watch Me without thinking.

716
01:07:30,701 --> 01:07:33,181
Let’s see if you can do it.

717
01:07:33,181 --> 01:07:34,471
Without thinking.

718
01:07:34,471 --> 01:07:39,750
Just watch Me without thinking.

719
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:47,061
Please put your right hand towards Me, right
hand towards Me like this.

720
01:07:47,061 --> 01:07:55,321
And the left hand above your head and bend
your head and try to see if you are feeling

721
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,341
any cool breeze from here.

722
01:07:57,341 --> 01:07:59,871
Bend your head, bend, bend it.

723
01:08:12,065 --> 01:08:13,169
Little higher.

724
01:08:13,201 --> 01:08:15,944
Some people get it very high, very high they
get it, some of them.

725
01:08:15,969 --> 01:08:18,079
Move it.

726
01:08:19,326 --> 01:08:25,926
And now put the left hand towards Me like
this, again bend your head and see if you

727
01:08:25,926 --> 01:08:39,285
are getting a cool breeze in your head.

728
01:08:39,285 --> 01:08:46,108
Now put your right hand towards Me again,
bend your head and see for yourself again

729
01:08:46,133 --> 01:08:50,403
if there’s a cool breeze.

730
01:08:59,954 --> 01:09:10,656
Now raise both your hands towards the sky
and push back your head and ask a question

731
01:09:10,656 --> 01:09:16,546
three times, “Mother, is this the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost?

732
01:09:16,546 --> 01:09:18,666
Mother, is this the Brahma Shakti?

733
01:09:18,666 --> 01:09:22,504
Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of
God’s Love?”

734
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:27,004
Just ask the question.

735
01:09:30,626 --> 01:09:33,348
Now put down your hands.

736
01:09:33,373 --> 01:09:36,023
Now please put your hands like this.

737
01:09:43,356 --> 01:09:48,916
You’ll feel very relaxed and peaceful.

738
01:09:48,916 --> 01:09:52,876
In the hands also you’ll feel little cool
breeze coming.

739
01:09:52,876 --> 01:09:58,775
Some people might feel in one hand, might
feel in another hand.

740
01:09:58,775 --> 01:10:02,805
Some of them do feel that way.

741
01:10:02,805 --> 01:10:19,865
All those who are feeling the cool breeze
on top of their heads or on their fingertips,

742
01:10:19,865 --> 01:10:23,813
please raise both your hands.

743
01:10:24,043 --> 01:10:32,285
Both hands to be raised those who are feeling
it.

744
01:10:32,285 --> 01:10:37,745
Just imagine!

745
01:10:37,745 --> 01:10:40,826
Most of them have felt it.

746
01:10:40,826 --> 01:10:42,045
Imagine.

747
01:10:42,045 --> 01:10:44,496
Hardly very few haven’t felt.

748
01:10:44,496 --> 01:10:53,015
It’s very easy for them also to feel it
and if they want they can come up to the stage

749
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,955
and people can look after them.

750
01:10:54,955 --> 01:11:02,095
They can feel it today, they should and they
will work out their Kundalini.

751
01:11:02,095 --> 01:11:10,342
Maybe little help is needed and it’s very
kind of you, all of you to have received your

752
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:11,842
Realization.

753
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:14,382
I bow to all of you.

754
01:11:14,572 --> 01:11:21,665
I bow to all of you and I beg of you as a
Mother that please look after your Self-Realization,

755
01:11:21,665 --> 01:11:24,115
do not waste it.

756
01:11:24,115 --> 01:11:30,375
Those who haven’t got it should not feel
in any way disturbed or upset, it’s very

757
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:31,526
simple.

758
01:11:31,526 --> 01:11:37,026
Maybe the little time was needed more or whatever
it is.

759
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:41,615
I would request them to come on the stage
for five minutes or ten minutes and they might

760
01:11:41,615 --> 01:11:44,446
get their Realization very well.

761
01:11:44,446 --> 01:11:46,716
May God bless you.

762
01:11:46,716 --> 01:11:55,574
Also if you want to come and meet Me you can
come on the stage, I would like to talk to

763
01:11:55,599 --> 01:11:56,599
you.

764
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:03,319
So many!

765
01:12:03,344 --> 01:12:05,413
Now what do you want?

766
01:12:05,595 --> 01:12:09,645
The England, the whole England!

767
01:12:09,645 --> 01:12:15,416
Those who want to be should come, one by one,
please.
