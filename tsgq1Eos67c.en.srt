1
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:57,824
- Today

2
00:05:59,056 --> 00:06:00,646
in this

3
00:06:00,646 --> 00:06:02,246
blessed place

4
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:03,359
of Mahaganesha

5
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:05,546
we have all assembled

6
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,209
to go deep into our own beings,

7
00:06:11,494 --> 00:06:12,819
To enjoy our own glory.

8
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:16,036
One has to remember

9
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:20,366
that the very first thing

10
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,826
God created on this earth

11
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:24,546
was Shri Ganesha

12
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:26,873
because he could emit

13
00:06:27,956 --> 00:06:28,789
holiness.

14
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:39,046
He exists as Chaitanya

15
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:44,146
and this Chaitanya exists
in the atoms and molecules,

16
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:45,456
As you know very well,

17
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,229
As vibrations symmetric and isometric.

18
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:53,426
These vibrations

19
00:06:57,686 --> 00:06:59,906
later on start expressing themselves

20
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:04,096
in the plant kingdom

21
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:06,819
as life force.

22
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:11,927
And you see how they are

23
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:13,529
kept under a bondage.

24
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:17,126
A tree that is

25
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:21,696
a mango tree will grow
up to a certain point.

26
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:31,979
A coconut tree will grow
up to a certain point.

27
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:36,186
It's all under control.

28
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:41,526
And then it is expressed in the animals

29
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,186
where it binds them.

30
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:47,229
That's why they're called
pashus, inside their bondage.

31
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:54,386
But in the human beings, it is expressed as

32
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:57,279
auspiciousness

33
00:07:58,531 --> 00:08:01,618
and ultimately as the epitome,

34
00:08:01,618 --> 00:08:02,618
as holiness.

35
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:06,042
Holiness

36
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:10,023
is to be understood

37
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:15,923
in its essence as
well as in this context.

38
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:25,081
Holiness is an innate
quality of personality.

39
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:29,589
Where a person rejects

40
00:08:30,756 --> 00:08:32,549
all that is unholy,

41
00:08:35,026 --> 00:08:36,699
All that is inauspicious.

42
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:43,906
The ego doesn't play any part.

43
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:46,706
Up to the animal stage,

44
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:48,666
ego doesn't exist.

45
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,469
But in the human stage

46
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:53,816
you are given freedom to choose

47
00:08:58,386 --> 00:09:01,406
whether you want holiness

48
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:02,239
or not.

49
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:05,469
But in the ego of man,

50
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:09,329
he might say

51
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:10,411
"what's wrong?"

52
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:16,981
And he may fight

53
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:21,678
All the rules and
regulations of the Divine

54
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:24,269
And take to unholy behavior.

55
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:28,656
But then he goes amok.

56
00:09:32,976 --> 00:09:35,513
Then we can see the results

57
00:09:36,426 --> 00:09:37,639
in this short time.

58
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:40,909
The results

59
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:44,189
of this defiance.

60
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:52,166
In the West, especially,

61
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,292
they're finding it impossible

62
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:56,559
to retreat back.

63
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,986
To begin with

64
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:01,199
people laugh at such people.

65
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:05,373
They make fun of them.

66
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:12,189
but holiness is the power within us.

67
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,796
As you have heard

68
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:20,596
that Rajput ladies

69
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:23,596
used to sacrifice their bodies so that

70
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:30,606
nobody tries to destroy their holiness,

71
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:31,439
Their chastity,

72
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:36,310
because they realise the power that lies

73
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,608
behind this chastity.

74
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:47,606
This sense of chastity

75
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:55,923
has helped so many women in this country

76
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:00,776
to lead a very dynamic

77
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:02,789
and holy life.

78
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,757
It is said that without holiness

79
00:11:12,146 --> 00:11:14,716
you cannot work out

80
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:15,899
anything.

81
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:23,226
Even, I've heard that

82
00:11:23,226 --> 00:11:24,059
in India

83
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,426
people believe

84
00:11:25,426 --> 00:11:28,626
that if you have to do wrestling,

85
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:30,589
the wrestler has to be a holy person.

86
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:36,538
If he's an unholy person, ultimately

87
00:11:36,538 --> 00:11:38,288
he will fail in life.

88
00:11:39,974 --> 00:11:43,216
Even those who play other games

89
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:46,626
have to be holy like Hanumana,

90
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:48,436
otherwise, they cannot

91
00:11:49,761 --> 00:11:51,656
continue with their games

92
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:54,442
and they might develop
some sort of problems

93
00:11:54,442 --> 00:11:55,942
within themselves.

94
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:01,516
The warriors who went on the wars

95
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:03,709
and fought

96
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:08,706
Other people had to lead a very holy life

97
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:12,326
otherwise they would suffer.

98
00:12:12,326 --> 00:12:15,106
As you have seen people
coming back from Vietnam

99
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:16,176
have become mad people.

100
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,736
In every walk of life

101
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:25,189
holiness was the most important part,

102
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:28,306
Most important subject

103
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,689
that was to be looked after.

104
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:38,209
No reaction took place to
people who fought with Shivaji.

105
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:45,159
But when I see the reaction of
war in some other countries,

106
00:12:46,106 --> 00:12:47,469
I'm quite surprised.

107
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:50,319
The reason is

108
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:52,956
while fighting the war

109
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:55,306
they fell into a trap of their ego

110
00:12:56,103 --> 00:12:59,481
and did not care for their chastity.

111
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:03,836
Chastity is not only meant for women.

112
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:05,129
That's a very wrong idea.

113
00:13:06,906 --> 00:13:09,286
It's very much more for men.

114
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:11,796
Those who lead a chaste life

115
00:13:11,796 --> 00:13:14,666
are the people who are glorious.

116
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:19,666
Tejas Punja, as we call it.

117
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:26,846
For Sahaja Yogis, the most important thing

118
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:30,106
is to lead a very holy life.

119
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:32,969
Everything else, is mundane.

120
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:39,686
Christ,

121
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,146
who came on this earth

122
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:42,979
As I told you,

123
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,866
was the incarnation of the same

124
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,689
Holiness as Shri Ganesha.

125
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:51,975
He had gone to this extent to say

126
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:55,369
That thou shall not
have adulterous eyes.

127
00:13:56,526 --> 00:13:59,676
Even your eyes should be holy

128
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:02,744
and innocent.

129
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,156
Innocence gives you that holiness.

130
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:09,246
As the children are

131
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:11,920
holy people,

132
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,316
because

133
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:14,409
they are so innocent.

134
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:22,051
There are so many things to
be learned from children.

135
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:23,826
In their simplicity,

136
00:14:23,826 --> 00:14:25,069
In their innocence,

137
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:30,419
They do not indulge into
things which are unholy.

138
00:14:32,176 --> 00:14:35,255
Holiness is not only concerned

139
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:40,513
with your married life.

140
00:14:41,726 --> 00:14:45,839
Also, it's concerned
with your political life,

141
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,489
With your economic life,

142
00:14:50,286 --> 00:14:51,486
With your national life.

143
00:14:57,726 --> 00:15:00,096
Chastity is the only keynote

144
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:02,086
for improving

145
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:04,456
all the problems,

146
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:07,083
all the problematic

147
00:15:09,504 --> 00:15:10,646
questions

148
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:13,810
or else solving them completely.

149
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,629
There's only one danger
among chaste people also,

150
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:23,776
that they might become extremely

151
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:26,556
dry

152
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:27,859
or could become

153
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:33,716
very hot tempered.

154
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,499
Sometimes also ego-oriented.

155
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:39,026
But just the opposite of Shri Ganesha,

156
00:15:39,026 --> 00:15:40,226
who is on the left side.

157
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:43,826
Shri Ganesha's holiness

158
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:46,936
is that of a child, eternal childhood.

159
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:47,859
It's so sweet.

160
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:52,106
The whole movement of his body

161
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,313
is so delicate

162
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:55,029
and so sweet.

163
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,213
Yet,

164
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,270
so charming.

165
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:12,252
He eats

166
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:13,524
a Modaka

167
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:14,612
which is a

168
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:16,562
sweet which is

169
00:16:16,562 --> 00:16:17,975
very simple to make

170
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:18,892
and very tasty.

171
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:23,018
To show that

172
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:25,315
we should have

173
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:26,508
sweet

174
00:16:26,508 --> 00:16:28,138
temperament

175
00:16:28,163 --> 00:16:28,996
Sweet nature.

176
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:36,796
So the idea that people
who are very chaste

177
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:40,586
are very rough, hot tempered

178
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:43,376
is absolutely wrong.

179
00:16:44,646 --> 00:16:46,126
Especially for ladies.

180
00:16:46,126 --> 00:16:47,339
It's very important

181
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,299
that

182
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:51,936
if they have to

183
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:53,336
understand Sahaja Yoga,

184
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:55,479
they must know that Shri Ganesha

185
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:57,766
works on the left side

186
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,066
and not on the right side.

187
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:05,646
This is a very big mistake

188
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:08,419
when we start using
him on the right side.

189
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:12,039
To express all our wisdom,

190
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:15,889
All our love.

191
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:17,882
Through holiness.

192
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:24,846
There's no end to what I have to say about

193
00:17:24,846 --> 00:17:25,819
this great quality.

194
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:29,729
Which all should imbibe,
respect and worship.

195
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,409
Only thing,

196
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:35,669
when you meditate,

197
00:17:37,936 --> 00:17:40,716
just believe

198
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:43,596
that your auspiciousness

199
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,456
and holiness

200
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,516
needs to be imbibed on your nerves

201
00:17:49,516 --> 00:17:51,139
on your central nervous system,

202
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:55,825
because that is the epitome of Chaitanya.

203
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:58,656
The Chaitanya that is flowing all around

204
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:00,586
if it is

205
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:04,126
in the form of holiness

206
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:09,056
even one glance of yours

207
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:13,895
can bring beautiful fruits.

208
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:16,998
Can bring peace and solace.

209
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:20,399
So this

210
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:22,497
innocence

211
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:26,506
and holiness

212
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,130
Is the one which is peace-giving,

213
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:34,626
Which reduces frictions, tensions,

214
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:39,051
because you enjoy

215
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,119
your

216
00:18:41,046 --> 00:18:41,879
chastity.

217
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:45,896
Because you enjoy

218
00:18:45,896 --> 00:18:46,729
your glory.

219
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,569
Please aspire

220
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:54,519
To be the epitome of holiness.

221
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:57,651
May God bless you all

222
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:01,246
(places her hands together in prayer)
