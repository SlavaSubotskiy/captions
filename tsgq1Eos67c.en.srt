1
00:00:02,485 --> 00:00:03,318
- Today

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,140
in this

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,740
blessed place

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,853
of Mahaganesha

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,040
we have all assembled

6
00:00:13,487 --> 00:00:15,703
to go deep into our own beings,

7
00:00:16,988 --> 00:00:18,313
To enjoy our own glory.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,530
One has to remember

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,860
that the very first thing

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,320
God created on this earth

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,040
was Shri Ganesha

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,367
because he could emit

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,283
holiness.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,540
He exists as Chaitanya

15
00:00:45,982 --> 00:00:49,640
and this Chaitanya exists
in the atoms and molecules,

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,950
As you know very well,

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,723
As vibrations symmetric and isometric.

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,920
These vibrations

19
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,400
later on start expressing themselves

20
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,590
in the plant kingdom

21
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,313
as life force.

22
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,421
And you see how they are

23
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:19,023
kept under a bondage.

24
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:22,620
A tree that is

25
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,190
a mango tree will grow
up to a certain point.

26
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:37,473
A coconut tree will grow
up to a certain point.

27
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,680
It's all under control.

28
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,020
And then it is expressed in the animals

29
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,680
where it binds them.

30
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,723
That's why they're called
pashus, inside their bondage.

31
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,880
But in the human beings, it is expressed as

32
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:02,773
auspiciousness

33
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:07,112
and ultimately as the epitome,

34
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:08,112
as holiness.

35
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:11,365
Holiness

36
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,517
is to be understood

37
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,417
in its essence as
well as in this context.

38
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:30,575
Holiness is an innate
quality of personality.

39
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,083
Where a person rejects

40
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,043
all that is unholy,

41
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,193
All that is inauspicious.

42
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,400
The ego doesn't play any part.

43
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,200
Up to the animal stage,

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,160
ego doesn't exist.

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,963
But in the human stage

46
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,310
you are given freedom to choose

47
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,900
whether you want holiness

48
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,733
or not.

49
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,963
But in the ego of man,

50
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,823
he might say

51
00:03:14,823 --> 00:03:15,656
"what's wrong?"

52
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:21,796
And he may fight

53
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,172
All the rules and
regulations of the Divine

54
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:29,763
And take to unholy behavior.

55
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,150
But then he goes amok.

56
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,007
Then we can see the results

57
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,133
in this short time.

58
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,403
The results

59
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,683
of this defiance.

60
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,660
In the West, especially,

61
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,786
they're finding it impossible

62
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:02,053
to retreat back.

63
00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:04,480
To begin with

64
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,693
people laugh at such people.

65
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:10,867
They make fun of them.

66
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,683
but holiness is the power within us.

67
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,290
As you have heard

68
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,090
that Rajput ladies

69
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,090
used to sacrifice their bodies so that

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,100
nobody tries to destroy their holiness,

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,933
Their chastity,

72
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,970
because they realise the power that lies

73
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,243
behind this chastity.

74
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,100
This sense of chastity

75
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,417
has helped so many women in this country

76
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,270
to lead a very dynamic

77
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,283
and holy life.

78
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:16,251
It is said that without holiness

79
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,590
you cannot work out

80
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,393
anything.

81
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,720
Even, I've heard that

82
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,553
in India

83
00:05:29,553 --> 00:05:30,920
people believe

84
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,120
that if you have to do wrestling,

85
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,083
the wrestler has to be a holy person.

86
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,032
If he's an unholy person, ultimately

87
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:43,782
he will fail in life.

88
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,710
Even those who play other games

89
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,120
have to be holy like Hanumana,

90
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,930
otherwise, they cannot

91
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,150
continue with their games

92
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,936
and they might develop
some sort of problems

93
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:01,436
within themselves.

94
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,010
The warriors who went on the wars

95
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,203
and fought

96
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,200
Other people had to lead a very holy life

97
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,820
otherwise they would suffer.

98
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,600
As you have seen people
coming back from Vietnam

99
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,670
have become mad people.

100
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,230
In every walk of life

101
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,683
holiness was the most important part,

102
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,800
Most important subject

103
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,183
that was to be looked after.

104
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,703
No reaction took place to
people who fought with Shivaji.

105
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,653
But when I see the reaction of
war in some other countries,

106
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,963
I'm quite surprised.

107
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,813
The reason is

108
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,450
while fighting the war

109
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,800
they fell into a trap of their ego

110
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,003
and did not care for their chastity.

111
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,330
Chastity is not only meant for women.

112
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,623
That's a very wrong idea.

113
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,780
It's very much more for men.

114
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,290
Those who lead a chaste life

115
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,160
are the people who are glorious.

116
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Tejas Punja, as we call it.

117
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:32,340
For Sahaja Yogis, the most important thing

118
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,600
is to lead a very holy life.

119
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,463
Everything else, is mundane.

120
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,180
Christ,

121
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,640
who came on this earth

122
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,473
As I told you,

123
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,360
was the incarnation of the same

124
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,183
Holiness as Shri Ganesha.

125
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,540
He had gone to this extent to say

126
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,863
That thou shall not
have adulterous eyes.

127
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,170
Even your eyes should be holy

128
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,333
and innocent.

129
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,650
Innocence gives you that holiness.

130
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,740
As the children are

131
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,414
holy people,

132
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,810
because

133
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,903
they are so innocent.

134
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,545
There are so many things to
be learned from children.

135
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:29,320
In their simplicity,

136
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,563
In their innocence,

137
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,913
They do not indulge into
things which are unholy.

138
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,260
Holiness is not only concerned

139
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:46,007
with your married life.

140
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,333
Also, it's concerned
with your political life,

141
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,983
With your economic life,

142
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,980
With your national life.

143
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,590
Chastity is the only keynote

144
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,580
for improving

145
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,950
all the problems,

146
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,940
all the problematic

147
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:16,140
questions

148
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,320
or else solving them completely.

149
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,123
There's only one danger
among chaste people also,

150
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,270
that they might become extremely

151
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,050
dry

152
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,353
or could become

153
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,210
very hot tempered.

154
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,993
Sometimes also ego-oriented.

155
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,520
But just the opposite of Shri Ganesha,

156
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,720
who is on the left side.

157
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,320
Shri Ganesha's holiness

158
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,430
is that of a child, eternal childhood.

159
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,353
It's so sweet.

160
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:57,600
The whole movement of his body

161
00:09:58,857 --> 00:09:59,690
is so delicate

162
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,523
and so sweet.

163
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,793
Yet,

164
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:06,764
so charming.

165
00:10:16,352 --> 00:10:17,746
He eats

166
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:19,018
a Modaka

167
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,106
which is a

168
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:22,056
sweet which is

169
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,469
very simple to make

170
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:24,386
and very tasty.

171
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:28,512
To show that

172
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,809
we should have

173
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:32,002
sweet

174
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:33,776
temperament

175
00:10:33,776 --> 00:10:34,609
Sweet nature.

176
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,290
So the idea that people
who are very chaste

177
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,080
are very rough, hot tempered

178
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,870
is absolutely wrong.

179
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,620
Especially for ladies.

180
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,833
It's very important

181
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,793
that

182
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,430
if they have to

183
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,830
understand Sahaja Yoga,

184
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,973
they must know that Shri Ganesha

185
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,260
works on the left side

186
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,560
and not on the right side.

187
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:11,140
This is a very big mistake

188
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,913
when we start using
him on the right side.

189
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,533
To express all our wisdom,

190
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,383
All our love.

191
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:23,376
Through holiness.

192
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,340
There's no end to what I have to say about

193
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,313
this great quality.

194
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,223
Which all should imbibe,
respect and worship.

195
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:38,903
Only thing,

196
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,163
when you meditate,

197
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,210
just believe

198
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,090
that your auspiciousness

199
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:49,950
and holiness

200
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,010
needs to be imbibed on your nerves

201
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,633
on your central nervous system,

202
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,373
because that is the epitome of Chaitanya.

203
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,150
The Chaitanya that is flowing all around

204
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,080
if it is

205
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,620
in the form of holiness

206
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,550
even one glance of yours

207
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,140
can bring beautiful fruits.

208
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:22,492
Can bring peace and solace.

209
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,893
So this

210
00:12:27,636 --> 00:12:28,469
innocence

211
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,203
and holiness

212
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:35,203
Is the one which is peace-giving,

213
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,120
Which reduces frictions, tensions,

214
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,780
because you enjoy

215
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,613
your

216
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,373
chastity.

217
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,390
Because you enjoy

218
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,223
your glory.

219
00:12:54,723 --> 00:12:56,063
Please aspire

220
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,013
To be the epitome of holiness.

221
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,458
May God bless you all

222
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:06,740
(places her hands together in prayer)
