1
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:13,740
Today is a special day of Guru Nanaka’s
birthday.

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:27,730
We have celebrated one Guru puja and, as you
know that, Guru Nanak was also the incarnation

3
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,380
of the Primordial Master.

4
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:34,210
The same Spirit came on this Earth.

5
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:46,379
And he’s the one who tried to re-establish
the work of Mohammed.

6
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:57,430
Mohammed was the incarnation of the same Spirit
– the Primordial Master.

7
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,510
He came on this earth to establish the religion.

8
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:15,340
Islam is the name of that religion, is the
religion of every Sahaja Yogi, of every Christian,

9
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,369
of every Hindu.

10
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:31,530
We all belong to one religion which believes
in expanding our awareness to the new perception

11
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:39,219
of collectivity.

12
00:01:39,219 --> 00:02:00,110
From human level to the higher level where
you can perceive and manifest the Divine Power.

13
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:07,549
This is the religion we are following.

14
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:16,849
All the religions were established on this
Earth to create the seekers.

15
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:17,950
You are the seekers.

16
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,250
You are the “men of God."

17
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:27,010
Now, all of you have to become prophets.

18
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:34,920
And to become prophets today’s Sahaja Yoga
has taken the form of Mahayoga.

19
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,099
All of you have to become prophets.

20
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:48,760
The prophets have two special qualities, as
all the prophets had: First of all, they have

21
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,239
to talk about spiritual education.

22
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,760
All of them did that.

23
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:08,090
Mohammed Saheb did it, Raja Janaka did it,
Nanaka did it, Moses did it, Abraham did it.

24
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:26,920
All of them prophesised and taught you how
to lead yourself in the right path, by the

25
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:35,680
right action, by leading a right life.

26
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:43,940
You are going to be the prophets of a little
different nature.

27
00:03:43,940 --> 00:04:02,450
You are prophets, you are Islamic, you are
Jews, you are Parsees, you are all those,

28
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:21,799
but you are going to become prophets which
are called as “pir’ in Islam, in Hindu

29
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:24,150
scriptures it’s called as “Atmasakshatkari’,
“Atmajas."

30
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:42,140
In the way Nanaka has described, he calls
them “par."

31
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:51,950
But you are endowed with a greater power.

32
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,880
There’s more power in you.

33
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:02,510
There they had a bigger propensity.

34
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:11,380
You have another delicate power by which you
can raise the Kundalini of people.

35
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:21,790
You are going to be prophets who are going
to make others prophets.

36
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:29,870
Not only to establish religion but to make
them prophets.

37
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:35,150
This is the most important thing.

38
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:45,340
Not just to maintain a static state of righteous
religious good people but to evolve those

39
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:52,460
seekers, those righteous, good, religious
people into prophets.

40
00:05:52,460 --> 00:06:04,210
And those prophets whom you will evolve will
also be the same type of prophets but they

41
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:13,590
will also have this additional power by which
they will also evolve.

42
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,210
That is why it is a Mahayoga.

43
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:33,560
This is the greatest work in the history of
all spiritual history, that you are the prophets

44
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:42,090
who are looking after the men of God, and
you are going to transform them into prophets.

45
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:56,990
To have so many prophets now, for me – you
can’t imagine how happy I must be feeling.

46
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:08,640
I have been, sometimes, very, very sharp with
you.

47
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,570
Sometimes I had to goad you.

48
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:23,510
Sometimes I had to love you, express my love
in that way, that you could feel that Mother

49
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,790
is very kind.

50
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:33,970
Sometimes I had to be very critical.

51
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,310
Sometimes also angry.

52
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,830
Behind all these aspects of your Mother, She
is nothing but Love.

53
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:50,180
Because She loves you so much, and She knows
that you have to be the prophets.

54
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:57,281
Your calibre may not be of the same level
as those prophets, maybe – you can’t say

55
00:07:57,281 --> 00:08:04,870
– but definitely you have got special powers.

56
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:15,800
Like, you can say, an old Rolls Royce might
be a better car as far as the propensity goes,

57
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,930
or an effect goes, or its behaviour goes – is
a good car.

58
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:30,170
But one of the modern ones may have more capacity
to show new acrobats.

59
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:39,409
For example it may tumble down, it may go
round the whole place and nothing will happen

60
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:40,409
to it.

61
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:47,490
Maybe, after some time, you might find a car
which goes half way and comes up a little,

62
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:55,550
like a hovercraft and then goes in the air,
and then again drops back.

63
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:14,850
So, this new generation of great prophets
are here before me.

64
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:24,560
But the big difference between them and you
is this: that none of them had a Mother to

65
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:38,500
guide them, to love them, to encourage them
when they were depressed, and also to spoil

66
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,330
them.

67
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:55,500
But you have here a Mother who may apparently
look to be spoiling her children.

68
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:06,500
But She is the Master of Masters and She knows
how far to take them and how to correct them.

69
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:15,160
Now, for all of you, I have to tell you that
you have to develop your independent discretion.

70
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:24,050
First of all we have to know that, in this
new realm where you have entered, you have

71
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:33,160
to have proper spiritual education, about
which I have given you so many lectures and

72
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,269
things.

73
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:41,649
But education doesn’t mean listening to
lectures after Realisation, it means it should

74
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:50,810
be imbibed within you, it should penetrate
into your veins, and into your every artery,

75
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,639
into every cell of your being.

76
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:59,490
You have to educate yourself spiritually.

77
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:12,160
And Guru Nanaka prophesised, just like William
Blake, that, “The men of God are going to

78
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:19,519
come during Kali Yuga, and there will be many
prophets who will be transforming prophets,

79
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:27,870
who will be transforming people into prophet
state,” [this] he had prophesised.

80
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:33,069
They have all prophesised about you!

81
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:41,020
Now you have to prophesise (sic) about those
who are going to be prophets.

82
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:50,190
But, as it is, you know that we need spiritual
education.

83
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:57,220
Because your Guru is a Mother we lack discipline.

84
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:03,139
There’s complete freedom for all of you.

85
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:08,589
You know that if you go to a guru what kind
of discipline you have to observe!

86
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:13,300
I mean the real one, also.

87
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,650
Unreal, of course.

88
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:21,180
But even the real ones, how they test your
attention.

89
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:27,449
Even for the smallest thing, how they treat
you.

90
00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:35,889
I’ll give an example of Ravi Shankar, who
was a very great, you know, who is a very

91
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:46,730
great sitar player: my father was an advisor
to the Maharaja of Maihar where their guru

92
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,180
(Allauddin Khan) was living.

93
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:56,660
This guru was a Muslim but he used to worship
Kali, Mother.

94
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,990
He used to worship Mother!

95
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,730
And [a] very self disciplined man.

96
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:09,270
They say he died at the age of 110 or 120
– Allauddin Khan Saheb.

97
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:15,760
And this Ravi Shankar was there.

98
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,690
I saw him as a young man, and this Ali Akbar
(Allauddin Khan’s son) whom you heard.

99
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,029
They were literally frightened of their guru,
who was a master himself.

100
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:31,360
He knew so many of these instruments.

101
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:40,559
One day my father, whom he used to respect
very much, always used to bow to him, though

102
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:46,050
he was a Muslim, they touched feet because
my father was a great connoisseur of music,

103
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:53,279
and a supporter of music, and he bowed to
him and he said, “Now, should I play?”

104
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,730
So he said, “Why not ask your disciple,
this Ravi Shankar, to play?”

105
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:00,480
And he said, “Yes, yes, come along, play."

106
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
he said, “Not today sir.

107
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,880
Please, not today."

108
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,470
he was very frightened.

109
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:11,129
Then he said, “Alright, let it be!” he
started playing.

110
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:12,980
He used to play on mrudangam.

111
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,379
Used to play beautiful mrudangam – tremendous!

112
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:22,160
I mean, you can’t imagine! he was a Realised-soul,
no doubt.

113
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,459
Then Ravi Shankar, when he finished and he
bowed to my father and he went away.

114
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:34,749
Then Ravi Shankar came to my father and he
said, “Don’t ask me to play before my

115
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,940
guruji!” he lifted his head and said, “See
here.

116
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,869
Do you see this bump?

117
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:47,279
This morning only, he hit me with my sitar,
which he broke, and this is the bump I have

118
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,279
got!”

119
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,910
So my father said, “What did you do?”

120
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,270
he said, “Only one note I played wrong!

121
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:01,740
That too not wrong but little out of tune,
and on that point he has broken this part

122
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,950
of my head and I have been in this terrible
pain and he said, “You are not to see any

123
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,950
doctor!”

124
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,950
And really there was a big bump.

125
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,759
He had covered it like that, with the hair.

126
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:24,569
(Laughter) That’s why today they have fame
as great masters, because to be masters you

127
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:30,709
have to obey your master and to discipline
yourself.

128
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:39,880
The spiritual education in Sahaja Yoga, under
Mataji Nirmala Devi, is absolutely left to

129
00:15:39,880 --> 00:16:00,620
your own wisdom: there is no force, there
is no compulsion, there is no organisation.

130
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:09,959
It is you who has to feel the joy of your
Spirit and it is you who has to share it with

131
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:10,959
others.

132
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:19,540
It is you who has to raise the Kundalini of
others.

133
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:39,290
Now, today, when we are thinking of a Great
Prophet who, on this Earth, came to establish

134
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:45,540
good relationships between Hindus and Muslims.

135
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:53,399
Imagine, when Mohammed Sahib came he did not
know that he was facing these horrible people

136
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,730
there who murdered him.

137
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,129
Actually they murdered him.

138
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:03,529
They gave him poison.

139
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:15,040
And when he died he said that, “There will
not be any need for any prophet to come in."

140
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,060
Naturally, if you torture somebody, what else
he’s going to say?

141
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:27,290
Also, he felt that whatever he has said, being
such a truth, it will definitely prosper and

142
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:31,220
the seed has been sown.

143
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,270
And he said, “There is no need for another
advent of a master."

144
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:49,900
But he found out that there was a big aggression
by the so-called followers of Mohammed, who

145
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:57,270
talked of nothing but rehmat (رحمت) – is
compassion.

146
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:11,060
Now, before his death he encountered all kinds
of attacks from the negative people.

147
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:16,950
Of all of them, the worst of all!

148
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,140
I think he has suffered the worst.

149
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:26,660
He had to move from places to places, hiding
the children away from negative forces, [from]

150
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,800
tribes to tribes.

151
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:43,450
It was a tremendous life, the way he led it.

152
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:54,390
And all his life there was nothing but struggle
for existence.

153
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:59,470
Only struggle for existence.

154
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:16,410
When Nanaka came in, he saw that Hindus and
Muslims were fighting, so he started his theme

155
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:30,000
with Kabira, saying that, “Ram and Rahim
are both the same, and how can you differentiate

156
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,240
between the two?”

157
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:37,150
All their theme was like this, of integration
of these two main religions which existed

158
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:43,230
in India.

159
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,090
That time, there was no question of giving
Realisation.

160
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:53,020
People were trying to defend their faiths
and fight each other and kill each other.

161
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,020
Imagine!

162
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,110
Created by the same Spirit!

163
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,320
Fighting among themselves!

164
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,660
How silly it must be, and absurd.

165
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,970
In many places Nanak Saheb has proved that
he was Mohammed.

166
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:13,640
Once, he was lying down and his feet were
towards Mecca.

167
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,030
So people said, “How can you put your feet
towards Mecca?”

168
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,720
He had Muslim disciples and also Hindu disciples.

169
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,050
He said, “Alright, whichever way you say,
I’ll put my feet."

170
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,420
He turned round his feet.

171
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,980
They said, “Still you are towards Mecca."

172
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:33,650
He went round and round and round [but] still
they saw him facing Mecca!

173
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:46,600
And they could not understand how it was that
he was facing, his feet were towards Mecca,

174
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,360
that Mecca was at his lotus feet.

175
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,480
Same with Mohammed.

176
00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:02,430
Now, all these great incarnations had a special
power over water.

177
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:12,740
Because you know, in the stomach we have our
Void and Nabhi Chakra which is made of ocean.

178
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:22,840
Ocean represents the incarnation of Adi Guru
– Dattatreya.

179
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,420
These had great powers over oceans and over
water.

180
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:35,540
Like Moses – he crossed the ocean by creating
a road.

181
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:41,990
That’s one of the very significant things
which shows that the Void can be crossed with

182
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,770
the help of the Guru.

183
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:51,240
And even Mohammed Saheb had a tremendous power
over ocean.

184
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:59,870
Then, Nanaka once put his hand on a rock and
water started coming out of that.

185
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:04,870
People were amazed how it started.

186
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,410
And that’s why it is called as ‘Punja-saheb’.

187
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,970
‘Punja’ means ‘the hand’.

188
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,030
‘Punja’ means ‘the five fingers’,
like this.

189
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:20,950
What do you say to this, this part, [of the]
hand?

190
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,810
Hand with five fingers?

191
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,890
Yogis: This is the palm.

192
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,450
Shri Mataji: No, no, not the palm!

193
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,140
The whole thing.

194
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,140
Like this is a punja.

195
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,140
‘Hand’.

196
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,140
Yogis: The hand.

197
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,140
The open hand.

198
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,830
Shri Mataji: But hand can be like this (a
fist) you see?

199
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,830
This way.

200
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,380
There’s no word, alright.

201
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,850
So this is ‘punja’ – this is five.

202
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:53,880
And ‘punjab’ is five waters, five rivers
– in that area – are called Punjab.

203
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:01,060
Now, another thing about these: all these
incarnations had to deal with your attention.

204
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:05,770
So they were particular about looking after
your attention.

205
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:15,830
And that is why, from the time Moses or Abraham
came in, they talked of no alcoholism.

206
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:19,450
All of them.

207
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:26,960
It is written very clearly in The Bible that
the strong alcohols, fermented, should not

208
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
be taken.

209
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,870
If you don’t want to read it, one need not.

210
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,920
But they think it was Moses who said it and
Christ did not say – so Christians can take

211
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,900
it, the Moses people should not take it.

212
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,890
There is no breaking of link between Moses
and Christ.

213
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:47,260
They are of the same tree, of the same pattern,
of the same thing.

214
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:54,870
But those who want to use Moses for their
own purpose will follow as much as Moses has

215
00:23:54,870 --> 00:24:00,780
said, and those who want to follow Christ
will follow only as much as Christ has said,

216
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,610
because it’s very good for them.

217
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:10,800
For such useless people Sahaja Yoga has no
place.

218
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:20,160
We have to understand that all these people
have said for our good and for the maintenance

219
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:28,330
of our spiritual life and none of them are
to be criticised or to be challenged but to

220
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,790
be fully respected as our Guru.

221
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,230
All of them.

222
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:42,590
Whether one belongs to Islam religion or to
the Jew religion or to the Christian religion

223
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,150
or to the Hindu religion.

224
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:51,040
And if they are fanatic they are going against
their guru – it is against their guru.

225
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,890
So, they were against fanaticism.

226
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,840
First thing they were against [was] alcoholism.

227
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,240
That’s the first thing, they thought, because
somehow human beings take to alcoholism very

228
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,240
fast.

229
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,280
At the time of Mohammed Saheb, people did
not know how to smoke.

230
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,590
Then they developed, became modern.

231
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:18,460
At the time of Nanaka they started smoking
so he prohibited that.

232
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:26,030
But Mohammed Sahib said that, “Anything
that goes against your awareness, any intoxication

233
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:37,840
of any kind” – he generally, he gave a
very general instruction, “is against God."

234
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:47,430
So, our training, our spiritual education
should be that we cannot be fanatics anymore.

235
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:56,140
If you are fanatic anymore, or you are identified
with any one of your old ideas, then beware!

236
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:02,280
Be very, very careful!

237
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:09,730
You cannot have fanatic ideas anymore if you
want to be a good Sahaja Yogi or a Maha Yogi

238
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:18,100
– meaning a person who is a prophet, not
only a prophet, but who is capable of transforming

239
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:24,210
others into prophets.

240
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,910
First is, you have to be away from alcoholism.

241
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,790
You should be deadly against it.

242
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:40,070
Whenever you have a chance you find it that
it is possible for you to say something against

243
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,070
alcoholism.

244
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:45,420
It should be absolutely boycotted.

245
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:58,210
Every place, anywhere you meet, it should
be smoking or any kind of intoxication, drugging,

246
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:06,250
anything, has to be completely branded as
anti-God, anti-Sahaja Yoga.

247
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:11,490
Then, fanaticism of any kind.

248
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,950
That lingers on.

249
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:17,320
This is another very deep misidentification.

250
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,200
I am aware of it.

251
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:29,110
I did not talk of Catholicism till the other
day I went to Portugal, when I had to talk.

252
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,920
So I said [for the] first time.

253
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:37,320
I never talked about Protestants before, till
I had to talk that they are another mad race

254
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
going round!

255
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,430
There are 27 churches of this kind.

256
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:52,600
None of them, except for we, are really Christians.

257
00:27:52,600 --> 00:28:01,190
All are nonsensical fanatics: Seventh Day
Adventists and Pentecostals, and this and

258
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,150
that.

259
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,470
All are absurd ideas!

260
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,890
All are playing into the hands of bhoots,
take it from me.

261
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,980
They have nothing to do with God, they are
anti-God.

262
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:21,270
All those who still stick on to all these
churches and to this kind of fanaticism – I

263
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:28,650
am saying here of churches because here I
have to talk about churches – should know

264
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,880
that all these churches have now become the
place of bhoots.

265
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,650
You’ll go to one church and you’ll rush
to me!

266
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:46,910
From my house I see in the night, hosts of
bhoots waiting out of the church.

267
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:55,750
(Laughter) I do not know! (laughing) And somehow
it’s happening that, whatever house I decide

268
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,750
to stay in, there’s a big church in front
of me.

269
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,850
(Laughter) It may be a Catholic church, may
be a Protestant church.

270
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:09,190
And they have seen to it that they make it
really bhootish by making all those who die

271
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,410
stay in that church.

272
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,970
They are not Realised people.

273
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:22,050
Realised people only should be buried and
all others should be burnt off.

274
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,050
It’s better.

275
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,340
At least the bhoots go out of them.

276
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:30,550
And they are roaming about in the church,
and you are taking the children down there

277
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,480
into the cemetery!

278
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,260
Apart from that wherever there is a anadhikaar
cheshta (अनधिकार चेष्टा

279
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,270
meaning ‘unauthorised activity’) – when
it is unauthorised – Gods do not exist there.

280
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,370
They leave the place.

281
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:51,510
So, we have to know that we are no more fanatics.

282
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:55,480
First and foremost thing is that we cannot
be fanatics.

283
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:03,850
Now, training ourselves is very important,
spiritual education is very important.

284
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:12,040
But in Sahaja Yoga, as your Mother is a very
kind teacher, but even such a kind teacher

285
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:19,600
is not such a help sometimes because all corrections
are left to yourself, and then you commit

286
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,860
really blunders and then you think, “Why
didn’t Mother tell us?

287
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,280
Why didn’t She protect us, why didn’t
She correct?”

288
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:35,520
But this is the style I have adopted because
in modern times, Sahaja Yoga is working out

289
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,770
because I do not challenge your ego.

290
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,890
Otherwise you would have crucified me long
time back.

291
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,160
So I leave it to you to decide to discipline
yourself.

292
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:52,250
It is for you to discipline yourself and understand
yourself.

293
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:59,760
Now, the best way to discipline yourself is
to find out, “What’s wrong with me?”

294
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
Not with others.

295
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,280
We are very good at that.

296
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,590
I have seen every day there’s some complaint
about somebody coming from someone.

297
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:15,570
But there are very few who will say, “This
is wrong with me, Mother, what to do?”

298
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,660
So just try to find out what is wrong with
you.

299
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,110
You are like a fort.

300
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:27,120
The fort has some sort of a weakness.

301
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:35,330
So, the man in charge of the fort – what
do you call him?

302
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:42,310
We call kiledaar ( किलेदार ) because
a fort is kila and the gentleman is the owner

303
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,830
of the kila, is called as kiledaar.

304
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:53,720
Now, this kiledaar finds out what are the
weak points of the fort and he sees to it

305
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,270
that they are all corrected one by one.

306
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:00,400
We are just the other way round.

307
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,420
We know we have weaknesses which we hide and
keep them there as they are.

308
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:12,040
Whatever strong points we have that we boast
of and we try to see the weaknesses of others,

309
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:18,950
and from these loopholes all these negative
things creep in and suddenly you find that

310
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,650
you are finished.

311
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:28,410
So try to find out what are your weaknesses.

312
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:37,160
One of the weaknesses, which is very common
is that we are very materialistic people,

313
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:42,690
we are still very materialistic, extremely
materialistic.

314
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:50,600
And the materialism is getting subtler and
subtler the subtler we be.

315
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,100
Try to give up some things.

316
00:32:53,100 --> 00:33:03,220
Keep a kind of a little balanced attitude,
a little detached attitude, not too many things.

317
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:07,630
Few things of value.

318
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,030
Try to detach yourself.

319
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,190
I don’t say you become sanyasis.

320
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,030
That is also another thing against.

321
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,520
But from inside you detach.

322
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:29,950
See, I’m wearing a very nice sari, but from
inside see what is the colour.

323
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,280
(Laughter)

324
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:36,510
From inside you should be detached, not from
outside.

325
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:40,650
So that, try to practice this detachment.

326
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,770
Whatever you want to possess, you just don’t
possess.

327
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,270
Teach your body, teach your mind: “No!

328
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:51,460
You want a shirt?

329
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,390
No!Nothing doing!”

330
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,390
You try.

331
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,290
Train up your body.

332
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:01,440
Now some people want comfort, the body wants
comfort.

333
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,240
Alright, “You want comfort?

334
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,450
No, I will sleep on the ground and teach you
a lesson!”

335
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:13,609
Teach your body a lesson!

336
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:17,179
Teach your wants and desires a lesson!

337
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,639
Let’s see what happens.

338
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:25,490
Now, I don’t know why, but in England it
should not be so.

339
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:29,710
I mean I expected people absolutely detached
because they have got everything.

340
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:34,720
But here it is much more attachment than detachment.

341
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,099
There is no satisfaction of any kind.

342
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:53,869
So, a kind of a detachment must be developed,
to your desires, to your belongings, to your

343
00:34:53,869 --> 00:35:01,009
possessions and whatever kind of a material
aspect you want to build up.

344
00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:09,029
I always said that you must not look like
people who are coming from the lunatic asylum,

345
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:16,099
that’s true, but you should also not look
like a dandy person, with a flair, a big bow

346
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:19,640
here, and a sort of a thing.

347
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,579
You should be in the centre.

348
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:26,990
And how are you in centre?

349
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,230
When you are detached.

350
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,780
Then nothing can impress you.

351
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:37,109
But that doesn’t mean…some people I’ve
seen that outside they make a show, that they

352
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:43,140
are absolutely dishevelled, absolutely in
a very filthy condition, smelling like pigs.

353
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,880
(Laughter) They think they are going to take
an avatara of Varaha (boar incarnation of

354
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,819
Shri Vishnu) by smelling like pigs!

355
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:59,520
And all sorts of funny things they do in the
name of detachment.

356
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,069
No – detachment is within.

357
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:06,869
Try to practice it.

358
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:10,299
That is one of the educations you have to
develop.

359
00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:12,599
How do you develop that detachment?

360
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:16,349
Is by giving things away.

361
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:20,549
Not to me, but giving things away to others.

362
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:24,619
Say you reach a certain state of – say you
have two suits.

363
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:28,070
If you have a third one then give it away.

364
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,109
Give away things.

365
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:37,499
It’s a very good way of developing detachment,
and enjoying the giving away than possessing.

366
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:45,360
It’s greater, is much greater, take it from
me, is much greater than possessing.

367
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:57,049
Now for you, at this stage, I cannot say,
but maybe after some time, it will become

368
00:36:57,049 --> 00:37:04,000
that I prophesise that you will become sinless,
absolutely sinless.

369
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,730
You cannot do sin and whatever you do will
not be sin.

370
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,910
I am sinless.

371
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:15,980
Even if I rob you of all your wealth nobody
can say I have committed sin.

372
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,190
I am absolutely sinless.

373
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:26,400
Even if I kill thousands and thousands of
people nobody would say that I have killed

374
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,180
because I am sinless.

375
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:39,160
But, despite all that state, I do not commit
any so-called sin because I have to lay down

376
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:44,640
my life in such a way that you people follow.

377
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,759
That you should not tomorrow say that, “Mother
did this, She has done this so why not we?”

378
00:37:50,759 --> 00:37:53,569
That’s why I’m so very particular.

379
00:37:53,569 --> 00:38:03,480
At the same point I would like to tell you
that today Chaya, in her sweetness, went and

380
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,089
bought a very expensive sari.

381
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:15,160
And she brought with such love and affection
to me, that I had told her just buy me a £10

382
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:20,630
worth of a shawl and she couldn’t bear the
idea.

383
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:30,710
But she should know [that] for me anything
is valuable that you give to me.

384
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,569
Nothing expensive is needed.

385
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:41,150
Even if you give me the most expensive I have
every right on that.

386
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:49,680
But you must understand that if this practice
is continued too much it will create a bad

387
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,680
public opinion.

388
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:57,690
So, at the most, definitely decide that you’ll
give me only two saris, that’s all.

389
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,519
I don’t need even these two.

390
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:01,770
And I can have all of them.

391
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:07,560
So, the situation is such that we have to
be very careful about the public opinion,

392
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,000
and people may start saying tomorrow, “Oh!

393
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,910
Mother, She wears all expensive saris."

394
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,950
Let my husband buy for me, he has lots of
money!

395
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,410
And you can buy me very ordinary things.

396
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:25,089
And I told once Modi that, “You buy me khadi
(homespun) saris, that’s the best,” but

397
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:26,200
he couldn’t bear it.

398
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,470
It was too much for him.

399
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:33,150
He says that, “Mother, we are middle class
people and we are giving you something middle

400
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,150
class."

401
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,150
I said, “Alright."

402
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:38,450
So, once for all I told them, “Alright,
you buy some saris."

403
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:42,800
And then I bought for them, one of them is
this one, and I don’t know if the whole

404
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,720
money is paid – most of the money I have
paid.

405
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,710
But still, you know, there was somebody who
came out with an objection!

406
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:58,490
I know you love me very much and you want
to do something for me like that, but I would

407
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:06,150
request that try to get things which are sober
and simple for me.

408
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:12,739
By God’s Grace, you should know your Mother
is looked after, you don’t have to worry.

409
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:23,400
Supposing I was a beggar then you would have
had to spend much more money but that is not

410
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
so.

411
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,000
And it is not that it is in any way wrong,
on the contrary, it’s a very great thing.

412
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,960
After all these are going to be in your Mother’s
personal archives and people are going to

413
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,150
see what saris you people gave me, and they’re
going to be very happy – of course, no doubt

414
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,850
– and that’s going to be very, very great
for you.

415
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:47,260
But, still, where the public is concerned
you be careful and understand that when you

416
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:54,930
do anything like that for me, this public
is mad and we have to keep a proper balance.

417
00:40:54,930 --> 00:41:06,519
Now, about training yourself, as I said, detachment,
then another thing is astuteness – astuteness.

418
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:12,789
Try to develop astute habits – astute – specially
for religious work.

419
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:19,760
First of all understand that you have to give
some money for Sahaja Yoga work.

420
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,530
In that you should be astute.

421
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:28,050
I was amazed to hear from some people that
for food also you want to have free – that

422
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,279
sometimes you had food you didn’t pay even
one pound.

423
00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:33,010
I mean this is absurd.

424
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:39,210
If you were beggars is alright, but for Sahaja
Yoga, first of all, it’s not too much.

425
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:42,140
But little you have to pay.

426
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,529
And you should not make your Mother pay for
you.

427
00:41:44,529 --> 00:41:45,529
It’s wrong.

428
00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:49,960
I never said this before, but today I’m
telling you.

429
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,920
Not aesthetically, but spiritually it is wrong
that I should pay for you.

430
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:00,130
It’s alright – I may give you a dinner,
it’s different, I may give you anything,

431
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:07,020
it’s different, but that you should not
try to take advantage in any way or exploit

432
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:16,539
in any way this Mother of yours, who has got
lots of things other than what you know of,

433
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:19,970
which can work out against your spiritual
growth.

434
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,450
So just don’t do anything like that.

435
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,890
No exploitation.

436
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:28,339
Learn that.

437
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:33,190
Those who have done such a thing must decide
that no more like that.

438
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:38,609
Now, I’ll tell you a difference between
Indians and you people is this: that an Indian

439
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:40,890
would never do that.

440
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:46,539
We had one Indian coming here and he was not
such a big Sahaja Yogi, but he used to come

441
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:50,740
for his puja, and he would not take money
for his puja and these people had to fight

442
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,740
with him.

443
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,549
Ask him, he’s sitting down, he would not
take.

444
00:42:53,549 --> 00:42:58,269
But how materialistic we are!

445
00:42:58,269 --> 00:43:03,910
And then, when people mesmerise you then you
buy a Rolls Royce for that person, and here

446
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:09,550
a Mother is giving you all the freedom, so
you are exploiting your Mother!

447
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:14,250
“I have no job,” all this is wrong.

448
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:18,680
You must pay for your food, and must pay where
you have to pay.

449
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:23,020
That’s your dharma, that’s your religion,
of every Sahaja Yogi.

450
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:28,960
Alright, you need not pay too much, but you
must pay where it has to be paid.

451
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,900
And never take a parasitic attitude.

452
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:36,289
That will kill your growth, will dwarf you.

453
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:39,430
I am warning you about it.

454
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:40,430
Astuteness.

455
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:46,079
For payment, for accounting, for everything,
one has to be extremely astute.

456
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,609
Like, I’ll tell you, I have seen people
used to come to my house, long time back – I

457
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:55,589
shouldn’t say this but [it] used to be so
funny – they would go in the kitchen, take

458
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:58,470
out anything, eat anything, walk off anywhere.

459
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,609
It was amazing!

460
00:44:00,609 --> 00:44:02,160
Our cooks could not understand.

461
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,430
Nobody could understand such people.

462
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:09,359
Just coming in the house, walking into the
kitchen, taking off whatever they like, eat

463
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:10,359
anything.

464
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:11,359
Like bounders!

465
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:23,920
This training has to come within you where
you must realise and understand that astuteness

466
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,239
towards Sahaja Yoga has to be maintained.

467
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:37,529
Like going into the ashram, walking into somebody’s
kitchen, taking out things.

468
00:44:37,529 --> 00:44:44,440
Using the ashram in a state as if it does
not matter.

469
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,440
It’s ashram!

470
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,660
It’s a pure thing.

471
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,670
You cannot fight in an ashram.

472
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:52,359
You cannot talk loudly in an ashram.

473
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:55,019
You have to lead a pure life in an ashram.

474
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:57,759
You cannot play games with each other.

475
00:44:57,759 --> 00:44:59,400
You cannot make it dirty.

476
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,489
You cannot spoil it, otherwise your spiritual
growth won’t come up.

477
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:09,099
This is the simplest thing one should know,
is to respect Sahaja Yoga.

478
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:12,109
Love without respect has no meaning.

479
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:16,789
You have to respect, and respect the place,
respect everything.

480
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:21,289
Keep it clean, be astute about it.

481
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:24,130
And this is one of the greatest trainings.

482
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:30,049
I don’t know how, but to a British mind
it should not be told, because they are known

483
00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:31,660
for this kind of a training!

484
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:43,119
But I don’t know, because now you are saints,
I think, I feel that you have had other kind

485
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:48,480
of training before, that you are born as saints.

486
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:57,670
Perhaps you have no self-esteem yet, of the
value that should be given to your own character.

487
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:02,369
Without that, nobody is going to be impressed
by you.

488
00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:05,140
Nobody is going to be impressed by you.

489
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,920
Nobody is going to become a prophet.

490
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,750
You have to first of all impress.

491
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,810
You have to dress up in such a way that you
impress others.

492
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:17,770
It’s a very important thing in Sahaja Yoga.

493
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,529
You have to talk in such a way that you impress
others.

494
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:25,839
Supposing somebody’s very fat, he must reduce,
somebody’s very thin, he must put on.

495
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,859
He must try to have a body of the centre.

496
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:33,970
Should not allow the body to move this way
or that way.

497
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:41,599
One has to be in a proper shape, in proper
dress, because you have to impress on others.

498
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,230
You must know that if the personality is not
impressive how are you going to communicate?

499
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:51,749
Because first of all the people see you, those
of you who come to you, see your outside.

500
00:46:51,749 --> 00:46:55,859
They don’t see your vibrations they see
your outside.

501
00:46:55,859 --> 00:47:04,119
So, all of you must learn how to dress up
and how to behave towards others, how to appear

502
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:10,400
before others, how to talk to others, so that
you become prophets who will do wonders and

503
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:18,770
who will transform many, many, many more people
into the same state as you are.

504
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:24,259
Now, this training you have to take yourself.

505
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:30,099
The another point in training in Sahaja Yoga
is that you have to read.

506
00:47:30,099 --> 00:47:39,589
There are many people who have not read even
Gregoire’s book, leave alone any other.

507
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:47,789
You have to learn certain things like chakras
and centres and mantras and you have to dedicate.

508
00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:52,692
Even people like Vivekanada’s who never
got Realisation – do you know, these people,

509
00:47:52,692 --> 00:47:57,319
twelve people – they used to study for fourteen
hours.

510
00:47:57,319 --> 00:48:06,309
Now you will know what to study, what not
to study, and even if you study wrong things,

511
00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:07,309
you will know where it is wrong.

512
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:08,309
So you have to study.

513
00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:11,609
For example, there are Jews with us – let
them study Torah and see there where is it,

514
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:12,920
Sahaja Yoga, in there written down.

515
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,540
Find it out!

516
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:18,249
If you are Christians read the Bible, find
out.

517
00:48:18,249 --> 00:48:22,720
You should read Gita, you should read Upanishadas,
and you should be masters.

518
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:30,099
You’ll find that Sahaj Yoga is such a light
that you will know what it is.

519
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:36,589
We have got the Devi’s names and the Sahastranamas:
try to read them and try to understand the

520
00:48:36,589 --> 00:48:40,460
meaning of that and try to understand what
it means, how far it goes.

521
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:45,970
That’s how the depth of your knowledge will
increase and your Sahaja Yoga will tell you

522
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:51,619
what is right and what is wrong.

523
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:57,479
Now emotionally, some of you have terribly
emotional weaknesses: the idea of ‘love’.

524
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:04,970
[About] that I must speak to you because it
has come from a group of people who went into

525
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:07,680
another style against the ego-oriented people.

526
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,290
And they believe that love means hugging each
other, kissing each other.

527
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:16,460
This type [of] nonsense is not love.

528
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:25,119
Love is this, that flows, that is love.

529
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,170
And understand the person through this alone.

530
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:34,260
And all nonsensical loves that people talk
of is not love.

531
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:40,519
When a person loves you he doesn’t stare
into you.

532
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:51,160
If somebody stares into you then know he does
not love you – he’s full of a bhoot.

533
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:59,239
Only when a realised soul is angry he stares
to drive out the badhas.

534
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:05,079
So, anybody who stares into your eyes and
says, “I have love,” then know that it

535
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:06,089
is mesmerism.

536
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:16,050
With discretion you will know this: that anybody
who loves, only a glance is sufficient.

537
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:28,749
But when it is an anti-Christ activity going
on then you can stare at that person and the

538
00:50:28,749 --> 00:50:30,229
thing increases.

539
00:50:30,229 --> 00:50:36,940
So the idea of love is so absurd.

540
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:46,650
Love is the one that corrects, that improves,
that elevates, which is blissful.

541
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:53,279
The relationship is blissful, not hallucinations.

542
00:50:53,279 --> 00:51:01,619
And this blissfulness is only felt through
vibrations not through by hugging or by kissing

543
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:08,080
or anything, just through vibrations.

544
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:13,750
Of course, I don’t say you should not hug
each other and you should not kiss each other

545
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,980
– you should, but that’s not the way it
is expressed, it’s through the vibrations.

546
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:25,099
It’s the pure love of your being which emits
just like light.

547
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:34,859
Everything should be done in the proper education
of the spiritual love.

548
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:39,569
We are people of dignity and sobriety.

549
00:51:39,569 --> 00:51:42,569
I have told you this before.

550
00:51:42,569 --> 00:51:46,529
Like, some people have a habit of doing this
in the — no!

551
00:51:46,529 --> 00:51:57,450
If you are sitting in a posture try to sit
for at least an hour – try.

552
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:04,640
I have sat on one posture for nine hours,
people have seen: didn’t go to bathroom

553
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,369
or eat anything and just sitting there nine
hours.

554
00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:13,410
This is known as baithak is ‘the seat’.

555
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:18,269
And this baithak has to be great in Sahaja
Yoga.

556
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:23,819
Try to establish your baithak, that is very
important, so that your attention is brought

557
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:29,390
in line with your Mooladhara and is straight
there.

558
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:38,630
Once you do that, practice it, you will find
your spiritual growth would be better.

559
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:41,859
Walk erect, be straight.

560
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:46,309
In your talks be straight, kind and gentle.

561
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:47,640
Need not shout.

562
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:54,089
No Sahaja Yogi should shout at anybody else,
should play games with another, should not

563
00:52:54,089 --> 00:53:01,920
in any way be angry with each other – is
prohibited.

564
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,930
Should not get into any tantrums of pulling
your hair or doing something like that – is

565
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:09,020
all nonsensical.

566
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,650
You have to be very, very dignified.

567
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:22,050
But another foxy method which we employ very
much is to tease and provoke another Sahaja

568
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:27,539
Yogi, which is even worse, because it hits
you at a subtler point.

569
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:31,779
Try to be straight, straightforward.

570
00:53:31,779 --> 00:53:37,989
Allow your mind to come to normal when you
talk.

571
00:53:37,989 --> 00:53:47,059
If you have to say something, wait and try
to say something nice, not artificial.

572
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:53,609
Try to say something from your heart, not
to show off.

573
00:53:53,609 --> 00:54:01,329
In talking also too much quietness is not
good, too much talking is not good.

574
00:54:01,329 --> 00:54:06,269
Some suffer from too much talking and some
do not talk at all.

575
00:54:06,269 --> 00:54:12,170
It’s better to talk whenever it is necessary.

576
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:18,400
Talk something sweet, no sharpness and sarcasm.

577
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,359
That will spoil your Vishuddhi.

578
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:25,050
Sarcasm is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

579
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:30,359
You are not to be sarcastic to each other.

580
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:41,319
Because of a new generation and a new race
that you are, you have to learn that to keep

581
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:47,450
your vibrations alright you have to have collectivity
within you.

582
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:53,190
Because you are collectively so much charged
that’s why the Kundalini’s rising.

583
00:54:53,190 --> 00:55:02,619
If your collectivity breaks then it’s a
very, very, very, very wrong thing.

584
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:10,329
So, try to be nice to each other, kind to
each other, try to understand each other’s

585
00:55:10,329 --> 00:55:11,329
problem.

586
00:55:11,329 --> 00:55:19,789
And never, never complain to me about any
other Sahaja Yogi – till I ask.

587
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:22,130
It’s prohibited!

588
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:27,160
If you have to say, tell me about yourself.

589
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,950
Unless and until of course something happens,
then it’s alright, but not against anyone.

590
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:38,259
Because you will only see the bad points of
the another person and you will not imbibe

591
00:55:38,259 --> 00:55:39,450
the good points.

592
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:46,390
You have to meditate and think about what
you have to do to become the real prophets

593
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:50,219
of modern times of Mahayoga.

594
00:55:50,219 --> 00:55:55,359
How you have to dress up, how you have to
behave, how you have to talk, and how you

595
00:55:55,359 --> 00:56:02,089
have to be kindly, that you have to decide.

596
00:56:02,089 --> 00:56:15,300
On this day, I would say that I have talked
a lot and only thing that you have to do is

597
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:19,890
to imbibe it in you and not on others, that’s
all.

598
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:30,109
To others you have to be kind, you have to
be sweet, you have to be patient, gentle.

599
00:56:30,109 --> 00:56:35,240
Now, today’s puja has to be very simple
because it is the puja of Guru, who is an

600
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,240
avadhuta.

601
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:43,559
Avadhuta, as I told you, always teaches you
that the whole thing is futile, all this pattern

602
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:44,720
is futile.

603
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:50,329
He even doesn’t talk of any Deities, because
he says, “Alright, let’s worship the Abstract.

604
00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:52,480
Why talk of the Deity?”

605
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,690
Though they will talk of the Mother, alright.

606
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:56,910
All of them talk of the Mother.

607
00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:00,940
But not of a Deity, because they think if
you talk of the Deity, people will talk more

608
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,289
about the Deity and not about the essence.

609
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:05,579
But talk is a talk.

610
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:15,819
Only at this stage you are prophets who are
talking about the Deities, and who are giving

611
00:57:15,819 --> 00:57:21,539
Realisation, and who know the Abstract is
flowing through them.

612
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:23,960
You are empowered to do that.

613
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,859
You know all about Deities, and you know all
about their mantras and you know how to awaken

614
00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:30,339
them and you know about yourself.

615
00:57:30,339 --> 00:57:31,960
You are all very great.

616
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,219
This may be the last puja now in London.

617
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:49,259
As a great thing we are worshipping today
Guru Nanaka, that’s me [so] that – may

618
00:57:49,259 --> 00:57:56,650
you become great Guru Nanakas.

619
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:01,339
All of them were created by Adi Shakti.

620
00:58:01,339 --> 00:58:04,920
All these Gurus were created by her.

621
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:15,609
And today I say that you all become as great
as Guru Nanak, as great as Moses, as great

622
00:58:15,609 --> 00:58:22,869
as Sai Nath, as great as Nanaka, Janaka, Mohammed.

623
00:58:22,869 --> 00:58:28,510
All [of you] have to become as great as all
these great incarnations.

624
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,720
Just desire!

625
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:35,190
Have earnestness in you and alertness to achieve
it.

626
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:39,339
[Only] earnestness is not sufficient, you
have to be alert.

627
00:58:39,339 --> 00:58:46,109
I have already told you how to practice this
alertness.

628
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:47,219
Try to do it.

629
00:58:47,219 --> 00:58:52,561
I have told Hari certain things, you can ask
him, and I have told other people also, how

630
00:58:52,561 --> 00:58:58,450
to become alert, and how to change your little
habits here and there.

631
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:03,250
Anything overdoing should be stopped: taking
of too much tea, taking of too much milk,

632
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:04,680
eating too much, too much reading.

633
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,230
Anything like that, just try to moderate.

634
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:14,119
Moderation has to be brought in, and you will
be surprised [that] you can master your tongue,

635
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:15,789
you can master it.

636
00:59:15,789 --> 00:59:24,119
May God bless you all, this day, in the name
of Nanaka I bless you all with that great

637
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:31,759
Spirit of Master, which you all should become
– the great prophets who are going to change

638
00:59:31,759 --> 00:59:41,460
all the men of God into prophets.

639
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:47,009
May God bless you!

640
00:59:47,009 --> 00:59:51,829
Today the puja has to be in a different way
if you don’t mind.

641
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:59,729
Gavin, first of all you do me any favour.

642
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:10,569
I have to tell you that today I want to give
some presents to you all and accordingly I

643
01:00:10,569 --> 01:00:15,289
have brought some presents for you all.

644
01:00:15,289 --> 01:00:22,239
Because these are material things, but all
are used by me, all are vibrated, and very

645
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:25,150
spontaneously we are going to choose them
all.

646
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:28,920
It was within two hours time we have done
some choosing.

647
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:34,690
But in this one has to understand that it’s
all done just to express the Dhanesh Shakti

648
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:39,390
of the Mother, just that She loves to give.

649
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:45,329
She loves to give.

650
01:00:45,329 --> 01:00:50,819
Just out of joy that I had in Hampstead, I
felt I should now give you something.

651
01:00:50,819 --> 01:00:59,619
It’s beautiful there and that’s how we
have today tried to make some arrangement

652
01:00:59,619 --> 01:01:02,630
for that kind of a thing.

653
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:13,569
So just before the puja I wanted to announce
this and then we can have the puja – very

654
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:21,640
simple one, because today is a day of simplicity
– complete surrendering.

655
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:36,660
Just imagine that these two colours are in
the Void, green and yellow, and if you mix

656
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:41,569
them what is the colour you get?

657
01:01:41,569 --> 01:01:43,280
Green and yellow?

658
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,549
You get the blue.

659
01:01:45,549 --> 01:01:50,390
So the green is the Nature.

660
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:55,220
So an avadhuta has to become one with the
Nature.

661
01:01:55,220 --> 01:02:01,849
This is the sign of the Surya nadi, the Sun.

662
01:02:01,849 --> 01:02:10,700
That means an avadhuta has to be brilliant
like the Sun, brilliant like the Sun, and

663
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:15,599
that detached as the Sun is.

664
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,339
All the detachment must come into him.

665
01:02:17,339 --> 01:02:21,269
He need not have liver on Sun line.

666
01:02:21,269 --> 01:02:25,730
He will not have liver if he knows what to
eat and what not to eat.

667
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:26,829
Normally all these gurus ate fruits, and they
ate meat, never fats and that’s how they

668
01:02:26,829 --> 01:02:27,829
kept their liver alright.

669
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:37,410
This is, these are the two combinations which
are there in the Void.

670
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:42,160
And the combination of these two, when they
combine, it makes a blue.

671
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,160
What is the blue?

672
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,160
Is the water.

673
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,759
So, in the water.

674
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:51,299
Now see the Gurus are surrounding the Lakshmi
on the Nabhi.

675
01:02:51,299 --> 01:02:57,079
On the Nabhi is the Lakshmi is in the centre
and they are surrounding her.

676
01:02:57,079 --> 01:02:59,089
They are her beauty.

677
01:02:59,089 --> 01:03:03,019
Without vairAgnya, without ascetic temperament,
the Lakshmi has no meaning.

678
01:03:03,019 --> 01:03:04,019
It has no meaning.

679
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:05,779
It is expressed in giving, is giving.

680
01:03:05,779 --> 01:03:15,969
That is what it means, that without vairAgnya
the Lakshmi has no meaning.

681
01:03:15,969 --> 01:03:19,720
Without the feeling of giving Lakshmi has
no meaning.

682
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:23,789
Why should Lakshmi come to anyone if they
do not want to give?

683
01:03:23,789 --> 01:03:27,593
And that is what one has to understand, is
the significance of giving.

684
01:03:27,593 --> 01:03:34,910
Now, today’s speciality is this, that: though
I am the Lakshmi – alright, I am the Mahalakshmi

685
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:41,490
in everything – but I am also Vairagyi,
I am the detached.

686
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:44,829
The One who is Nirmama, is beyond.

687
01:03:44,829 --> 01:03:48,119
Nobody can tie me, nobody can.

688
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:50,309
Nothing can bound me.

689
01:03:50,309 --> 01:03:54,240
I just talk but it has no meaning, I am beyond.

690
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:58,140
In the same way, all of you should try to
be beyond.

691
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:05,469
So, from the Lakshmi angle I want to give
you something, because Lakshmi looks after

692
01:04:05,469 --> 01:04:08,469
the saints, and the saints have to be detached.

693
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:17,630
That is the way it is going to work out.

694
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:25,180
I hope you won’t go back and wear kashayas,
the orange robes (laughter).

695
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:26,700
Discretion, discretion, has to mature.

696
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,700
It’s the maturity of discretion now.

697
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:28,830
So, now, for puja today, Chaya, let’s have
a very simple puja, whichever way you like.

698
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:30,329
Now, have you got Guru’s names?

699
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:31,880
Just see it, their name.

700
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,400
That I know, Graham.

701
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,900
Guillemette: Guillemette.

702
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:38,140
Shri Mataji: Loudly.

703
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,630
Guillemette: Guillemette.

704
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:41,869
Gavin Brown: Guillemette.

705
01:04:41,869 --> 01:04:46,770
Shri Mataji: How do you spell?

706
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:52,369
Gavin Brown: G-u-i-l-l-e-m-e-t-t-e.

707
01:04:52,369 --> 01:05:03,560
Shri Mataji: What’s your name, please?

708
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,420
Loudly.

709
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:09,150
Brian: Brian

710
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:14,750
Shri Mataji: Brian?

711
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:18,480
Rachel: Rachel

712
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:24,079
Shri Mataji: Rachel?

713
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,810
Christopher: Christopher

714
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:33,400
Shri Mataji: Christopher?

715
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,130
Christopher: Nicolas

716
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:42,730
Shri Mataji: Nicolas.

717
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:53,920
Shri Mataji: What’s your name please?

718
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:59,510
Richard: Richard Mother.

719
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:03,250
Bernard: Bernard

720
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:08,839
Shri Mataji: Bernard.

721
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:12,569
What’s your?

722
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:16,300
Ian: Ian

723
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:29,359
Shri Mataji: Now who else is here?

724
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:31,220
Eileen?

725
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:36,820
I now here.

726
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:41,789
You haven’t washed my hands?

727
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:45,249
No, Isodor has.

728
01:06:45,249 --> 01:06:48,719
Alan you have?

729
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:49,869
Never?

730
01:06:49,869 --> 01:06:53,339
Imagine! (laughter) Alright.

731
01:06:53,339 --> 01:06:57,660
So let’s have the start.

732
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:03,079
Gavin Brown: Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Gurur
Devo Maheshwara, Guru Sakshat Parabrahma,

733
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:04,079
Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma, Tasmai Guruve namaha.

734
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:05,920
Shri Mataji: You all know the meaning of this?

735
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,920
Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Gurur Devo Maheshwara.

736
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:21,190
The Guru is the creator, Guru is the protector,
and Guru is the existence and the destroyer.

737
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:35,130
Guru is the embodiment of the Parabrahma,
it’s the beyond state.

738
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:42,900
And to such a Guru we bow.

739
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:57,089
Just a little you can take it on your fingers
you can dip it, you see, and put it on your

740
01:07:57,089 --> 01:07:58,089
forehead, maybe.

741
01:07:58,089 --> 01:07:59,390
It’s a water which is now [vibrated].

742
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:00,390
Haa!

743
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:02,900
You will feel better.

744
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:09,150
On the Sahasrara you can put it.

745
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:15,849
Just sprinkle it all over you can.

746
01:08:15,849 --> 01:08:18,719
Let him do.

747
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:23,739
Sprinkle it all over.

748
01:08:23,739 --> 01:08:29,829
Who are these?

749
01:08:29,829 --> 01:08:34,900
Maria is here.

750
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:37,799
Yes.

751
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:55,210
Jaldi karo! (hindi: do it quickly)

752
01:08:55,210 --> 01:09:01,409
Five people together should come forward – alright?

753
01:09:01,409 --> 01:09:05,569
Come along!

754
01:09:05,569 --> 01:09:11,819
Five of you.

755
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:13,900
Yes.

756
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:18,069
Come along!

757
01:09:18,069 --> 01:09:29,120
Get your finger into there and to my hand.

758
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:33,109
Turn it like that, clockwise, with both the
hands.

759
01:09:33,109 --> 01:09:34,109
Alright.

760
01:09:34,109 --> 01:09:39,949
Now you rub your own hand.

761
01:09:39,949 --> 01:09:45,810
Now come along, you do it.

762
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:47,760
Come along.

763
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,719
Rub it.

764
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:51,670
It’s good.
