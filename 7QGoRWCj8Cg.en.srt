00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,234
Subtlety. Dollis Hill, London (UK), 8 June 1980.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,511
It is only possible for people who are of a subtler nature

3
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:25,378
to understand the value of Sahaj Yoga,

4
00:00:25,578 --> 00:00:30,519
to hold to the values of Sahaj Yog,

5
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:37,699
and to retain it in this fragmented world.

6
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:42,729
The world is fragmented

7
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:49,875
and everybody is acting towards one’s own destruction.

8
00:00:52,698 --> 00:01:00,798
All the values which people follow are gross values.

9
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:06,103
Most of the values are absolutely gross.

10
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:11,942
So for Sahaj Yoga we have to have people

11
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:20,165
who are trying to justify their subtleties.

12
00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:28,243
Such subtler people

13
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:34,157
have always been

14
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:38,180
a little different from the mundane crowd;

15
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:44,551
and these people

16
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:53,387
always express themselves in such a manner

17
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:59,919
that their existence itself suggests

18
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:10,953
that they are trying to cement the whole world.

19
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:16,810
Sort of you can feel that.

20
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:25,070
[Marathi]

21
00:02:29,558 --> 00:02:33,616
Those who can feel

22
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:39,493
that there is an element within us

23
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:45,556
which makes us laugh at the stupidity of others,

24
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:48,940
who may appear to themselves

25
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,604
to be very seriously doing certain things.

26
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:55,319
But to us it seems as if it’s rather stupid to

27
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,337
waste their lives.

28
00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:04,893
This is a calibre of different people.

29
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:07,796
First these people, with that calibre

30
00:03:07,997 --> 00:03:10,038
and that dynamism within them,

31
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,469
will be settled in Sahaja Yoga, not the ordinary gross type.

32
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:22,641
But because our doors are open to everyone,

33
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:30,231
because there is no charge or anything, for anything,

34
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:34,447
all sorts of people come in.

35
00:03:35,704 --> 00:03:39,407
And when they come in they don’t know what they want.

36
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:45,047
Out of them some could be the grossest of all.

37
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:49,320
Some might be just walking in to take out some things,

38
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,770
just to steal something; possibly.

39
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:58,893
I have seen all kinds of people coming to Sahaj Yog.

40
00:03:59,093 --> 00:04:02,354
Such people when they find that there’s something available,

41
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:06,515
they come in and go away.

42
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:15,866
Another kind, maybe, which is coming here,

43
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:23,258
is the one which is extremely gross,

44
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:31,389
but they can think that he can make some liaison work here;

45
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:36,474
[that] by having connections with different people

46
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:41,356
he can exploit it and make some money out of it.

47
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:45,028
So money mindedness is a very gross thing,

48
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:48,833
is a very gross thing.

49
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:51,634
If people are money minded

50
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:57,187
then Sahaja Yoga doesn’t work out well with them.

51
00:04:57,984 --> 00:05:00,647
If you always think about money, of your insurance,

52
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:04,174
about how the carpet is spoiled, this has happened, that happened:

53
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:08,950
such people are very difficult.

54
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,294
But lower than these are the people who come here

55
00:05:12,494 --> 00:05:17,312
to have some sort of an exploitation out of Sahaj Yog.

56
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:21,398
Such gross people also come in,

57
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:26,656
and when they find that they cannot work out their plans,

58
00:05:26,856 --> 00:05:30,684
they get out of it.

59
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:36,632
Now the third type of people who come here,

60
00:05:36,832 --> 00:05:42,619
they come for some material gain from Sahaj Yog,

61
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:46,017
maybe physical gain also: like somebody is sick,

62
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:49,376
so they come for their sickness.

63
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:52,014
It’s a very gross way of looking at things:

64
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:57,835
is to come to Sahaj Yog for getting cured.

65
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:03,921
So when they get cured they disappear.

66
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,354
Quite stupid isn’t it!

67
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:18,366
Then some people come with the idea that,

68
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:22,437
“Maybe, with Mother’s blessings, our financial problems will be solved.”

69
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:25,606
Only with that idea!

70
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:29,130
Then they also get their financial problems solved,

71
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,611
and they get out.

72
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:40,268
But some of them do not,

73
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:47,453
some of them cannot manage what they want to have,

74
00:06:47,653 --> 00:06:51,926
then they get upset.

75
00:06:54,994 --> 00:07:01,595
Now the best calibre, of the subtlest form,

76
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:10,841
is that which is just seeking Sahaj Yog,

77
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:18,976
which is just seeking union with God, nothing else;

78
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:23,027
 that’s the best calibre.

79
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,588
That calibre works hard.

80
00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:41,923
It has very concentrated effort.

81
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:47,233
It understands Sahaj Yog very quick.

82
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:55,994
[The] only thing is that,

83
00:07:56,194 --> 00:08:03,166
because of Western habit of thinking,

84
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:11,303
some of the people, though they have a calibre,

85
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:16,506
circulate around themselves;

86
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:21,774
they go on thinking about it, discussing about it,

87
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:24,821
arguing about it,

88
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:29,601
and then they become stationed at a point.

89
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:35,523
(laughing) Otherwise it goes little round and round itself.

90
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:40,726
They have a calibre, they have a height, they definitely have.

91
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:46,458
They have that weight in them, they can feel their element,

92
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:48,973
but still they go on, as a habit,

93
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:54,996
because they are used to it; they go on encircling round and round and round.

94
00:08:55,196 --> 00:09:00,063
They have to steady themselves.

95
00:09:03,297 --> 00:09:07,968
But

96
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:16,482
the calibre of a person

97
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:25,908
who just wants to be, to become,

98
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:31,009
can never be deterred by anything,

99
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:35,017
because he is subtle, in a way;

100
00:09:35,217 --> 00:09:40,174
in his lifetime he feels the subtleties of the unconscious.

101
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:46,933
He has felt his archetype images of these Deities.

102
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:50,433
He has known them.

103
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:55,821
He had these eruptions within him.

104
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:03,957
He identifies and he recognises

105
00:10:04,157 --> 00:10:08,604
the subtleties that he has felt

106
00:10:08,804 --> 00:10:12,151
and he tallies them with Sahaj Yog,

107
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:17,775
and Sahaja Yoga gets him like that.

108
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:32,728
Now these subtleties which I am describing to you,

109
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:40,468
come to you not through your mental effort of this lifetime,

110
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:46,767
but comes to you from the experiences of many lives

111
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:52,056
you have gone through

112
00:10:52,256 --> 00:10:58,271
and as soon as you come near Sahaja Yoga,

113
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:02,083
you start sucking.

114
00:11:02,283 --> 00:11:06,322
That is the best calibre.

115
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:10,833
But, because the door is open ajar,

116
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:13,708
the grossest of gross also can come in.

117
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:18,931
But sometimes they come this way and go back the same way.

118
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:23,251
Some of them, they come half way and rush back.

119
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:28,470
Some of them come inside and get out from the other side.

120
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:36,649
But those who stay are the people who are subtler by nature.

121
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:44,454
It is a very subtle happening.

122
00:11:44,654 --> 00:11:49,412
If you have lost your subtleties:

123
00:11:49,612 --> 00:11:51,612
say, some people as I said,

124
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:55,325
even doing hard work with your fingers, you become insensitive.

125
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:59,786
Even physical disrespect to your fingers,

126
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:06,798
you become a little bit insensitive,

127
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:13,212
[so that] even when you get your Realisation,

128
00:12:13,412 --> 00:12:17,571
you may not feel the vibrations that good.

129
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,557
But that is not so important.

130
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:25,393
Of course, vibrations you must feel for Realisation.

131
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:30,632
But maybe due to some external reasons also,

132
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:37,280
or maybe due to some physical problem,

133
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,627
you may get

134
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:49,307
a situation where you may not feel the vibrations so much.

135
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,853
But doubts would not rise in your minds

136
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:55,275
because there are no vibrations.

137
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:59,033
You would just think that, “Yes the vibrations are not there,

138
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:02,353
I must get my Vishuddhi Chakra all right.

139
00:13:02,553 --> 00:13:06,202
But it is there.”

140
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:15,322
And even if the doubts come in,

141
00:13:15,522 --> 00:13:21,326
a subtle person will fight it,

142
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:27,589
will argue it out, but a gross person won’t.

143
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:39,491
The subtle person is a brave man

144
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:44,671
and his bravery comes from

145
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:51,643
his built in capacity of those subtleties.

146
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,005
He does not succumb to doubts.

147
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:04,759
He just sees it [and] he fights it. He does not succumb to it.

148
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:09,778
But Sahaja Yoga is such a wonderful thing

149
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:14,498
[that] even those people who sometimes looked very gross,

150
00:14:14,698 --> 00:14:18,812
suddenly came out

151
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:23,375
with such a beautiful manifestation of subtleties

152
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:27,437
that it is surprising.

153
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:31,754
But that is exceptional.

154
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:47,060
The mind, and the human brain,

155
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:52,483
is subtle on certain points and gross on some points;

156
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:57,753
it’s most surprising. Maybe [due to the] background, maybe the…

157
00:14:57,954 --> 00:15:02,132
Can you take her at the back. Because
you know it’s disturbing. Nah?

158
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:07,410
Just now take her at the back all right? Good!

159
00:15:09,907 --> 00:15:13,933
Just give her a seat to sit down all right? Sorry!

160
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:17,457
Then I am going to take you in my lap, huh?

161
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:22,592
She is very unhappy to leave the place!

162
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:31,102
It’s a very subtle subject, you see. Please pay attention.

163
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:38,262
If a genius is created.

164
00:15:38,463 --> 00:15:40,463
Or we can say a...

165
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:43,636
They call it a prodigy, but I would call it a genius.

166
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:48,027
There’s a difference between a prodigy and a genius:

167
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:59,654
prodigy is a person who, for a short time of their lifespan,

168
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:02,771
suddenly becomes very talented,

169
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:06,076
and after some time the talent goes away.

170
00:16:06,276 --> 00:16:09,338
And a prodigious person may be mentally

171
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:17,095
absolutely very, very low; very low.

172
00:16:17,295 --> 00:16:28,237
So it is done by some sort of a spirit possession.

173
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:33,197
But a person who is a genius

174
00:16:33,397 --> 00:16:37,720
is a person who has those sensitivities.

175
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,009
The mind which is covered with thoughts,

176
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,165
which is thickened,

177
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:46,571
which is gross,

178
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:48,907
can be thinned out at certain points

179
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:54,074
and could be very sensitive to certain points.

180
00:16:54,894 --> 00:17:02,124
For example, some people could be very sensitive to music,

181
00:17:02,324 --> 00:17:10,129
some could be to art, some could be to human beings,

182
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,442
some could be to other things

183
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:25,384
which might make them rare people.

184
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:33,422
But these subtler things,

185
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:37,891
which create your personality,

186
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:41,848
always indicate, in your being,

187
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:46,762
that there is something of the beyond,

188
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:52,742
which is throwing some images within you.

189
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:55,531
Such people are conscious of them:

190
00:17:55,731 --> 00:17:59,007
that there are some images which are throwing these

191
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:06,694
subtle ideas within you,

192
00:18:06,894 --> 00:18:19,519
[and that] they are erupting some new commotion within you;

193
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:22,511
and once you start feeling them

194
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:27,711
you are compelled to put them down somewhere.

195
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:32,785
That’s how the poets are created, musicians are created,

196
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:37,603
great masters are created.

197
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:46,274
Now the fashioning of these subtle ideas is another job.

198
00:18:47,274 --> 00:18:51,108
But the beauty of these subtle ideas is this:

199
00:18:51,308 --> 00:18:55,077
that they are universal in nature.

200
00:18:55,277 --> 00:19:00,366
If they were not, they would not be so much appealing to everyone.

201
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:05,180
So there is something universal in those,

202
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,820
and that universality,

203
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:13,070
when manifested or fashioned into some expression,

204
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:20,020
then it is absorbed universally.

205
00:19:28,274 --> 00:19:35,651
Now it depends on the person how much he is closer

206
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:40,846
to those images and to the image of his Spirit.

207
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:45,801
If such a person is a realised-soul,

208
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:50,918
then the expression is heavenly.

209
00:19:51,118 --> 00:19:56,289
The fashioning of those expressions, of course,

210
00:19:56,489 --> 00:20:01,429
is determined by the surroundings,

211
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:05,257
the different atmosphere,

212
00:20:05,457 --> 00:20:10,941
the traditions, and all that, in which the people have lived.

213
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,705
That is the fashioning part of it.

214
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:18,806
But the universal essence of everything,

215
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:24,967
that element which is universal,

216
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:31,186
is manifested in a particular fashion.

217
00:20:31,386 --> 00:20:39,967
The more a person is nearer to his Self –

218
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:44,937
even the fashioning is very universal in nature.

219
00:20:45,137 --> 00:20:52,001
Then such a person doesn’t try

220
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:59,157
to be moulded by traditions so much.

221
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:06,800
But the traditions which have come through meditativeness,

222
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,525
or through realised-souls,

223
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:20,952
definitely give him a better chance of expression.

224
00:21:24,938 --> 00:21:28,618
So the fashioning also evolves, gradually, in every country,

225
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:32,706
in every place,

226
00:21:32,906 --> 00:21:35,550
till it reaches the point

227
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:42,170
where people start understanding them in meditation.

228
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,232
Now there are two types of fashioning:

229
00:21:45,432 --> 00:21:48,701
one is the fashioning that comes from outside,

230
00:21:48,901 --> 00:21:51,733
the other from inside.

231
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:55,522
The fashioning that comes from inside could be

232
00:21:55,722 --> 00:22:01,863
the teachings of the great masters, who are realised-souls,

233
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:09,644
and your own understanding of the work of these great masters.

234
00:22:09,844 --> 00:22:11,980
The other style could be that

235
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,504
you see what people have been producing, all of them,

236
00:22:15,704 --> 00:22:20,876
and you gather out of that, and fashion
your manifestation accordingly.

237
00:22:21,077 --> 00:22:23,411
In the second type of thing they may be realised,

238
00:22:23,612 --> 00:22:26,891
they may not be realised.

239
00:22:27,091 --> 00:22:30,953
Now when we go to Sahaj Yoga,

240
00:22:31,153 --> 00:22:36,692
even a person who is not a genius,
who has never been a genius,

241
00:22:36,892 --> 00:22:45,350
who had no idea of any special expression in life,

242
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:50,568
can get Realisation and of the highest type.

243
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:53,178
Maybe much more than a genius,

244
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:56,588
because genius might have become a geni-ass by now!

245
00:22:56,788 --> 00:22:59,428
His ego must have bloated out, he might be a geni-ass

246
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:03,499
instead of a genius!

247
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:13,565
But a Sahaj Yogi, when he gets his Realisation,

248
00:23:13,765 --> 00:23:19,816
his Realisation is a sign,

249
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:24,732
not of his subtleties,

250
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:31,292
but of his Kundalini – in what condition She is.

251
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:40,742
If the Kundalini is absolutely frozen

252
00:23:40,942 --> 00:23:49,184
that means a person has no desire to have Realisation,

253
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:53,660
he’s coming to Sahaj Yog to make some money out of it

254
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,045
or to make some name out of it,

255
00:23:56,245 --> 00:24:03,155
or to be - he could be a burglar coming as a Sahaj Yogi

256
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:07,855
to burgle away, say, my shoes!

257
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:18,504
Such a person can be very difficult for Realisation.

258
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:22,122
But maybe with some people,

259
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:28,201
who have some basic problems also,

260
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:33,284
can have their Kundalini completely frozen out.

261
00:24:36,836 --> 00:24:42,090
But people of very ordinary appearances,

262
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:48,412
of very ordinary life,

263
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:54,019
could be very subtle,

264
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:57,219
much more than all these genius

265
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,816
and geni-asses and geniuses put together –

266
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:06,142
because they can feel their Self.

267
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,095
Such people do not cheat themselves or others –

268
00:25:10,296 --> 00:25:13,110
no question.

269
00:25:13,908 --> 00:25:20,859
Their whole attitude towards Sahaj Yog

270
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:30,849
is like a person who is dying and gasping for air.

271
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:35,408
They are just struggling to get the Truth.

272
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:41,397
They have no other interest in life, but to get to the Truth.

273
00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:44,601
Such people could be very strong headed,

274
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:47,507
could be very different from normal.

275
00:25:47,707 --> 00:25:51,421
They may think many things [to be] stupid. Even just to have a wife

276
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:56,520
and children and family is quite stupid isn’t it?

277
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,589
That’s not the end of life.

278
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:04,253
It’s quite a stupid thing to do.

279
00:26:04,453 --> 00:26:10,310
I don’t say that you give up that, but it’s not the end of life.

280
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,607
It’s all right, it’s a part of it,

281
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:17,104
[but] you are not to be lost in it.

282
00:26:17,304 --> 00:26:21,143
We believe that marriage is important and we believe that,

283
00:26:21,343 --> 00:26:25,331
in the marriage, husband, wife should be very much

284
00:26:25,531 --> 00:26:27,992
understanding each other.

285
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:30,442
There should be love between the two.

286
00:26:30,643 --> 00:26:32,643
There should be enjoyment,

287
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,855
so that the children also feel the security of the family,

288
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:40,394
so the society improves.

289
00:26:40,594 --> 00:26:44,394
All this is all right, but that’s not the end of it.

290
00:26:44,594 --> 00:26:47,985
In India you will find many families like that:

291
00:26:48,185 --> 00:26:51,376
where a husband, wife are carrying on nicely,

292
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:54,415
children are nice, their money is in the bank;

293
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:56,969
when they die, the money goes to the children;

294
00:26:57,169 --> 00:27:01,282
then the children are married nicely, then they have their children,

295
00:27:01,482 --> 00:27:03,505
money goes to the bank;

296
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:07,014
when they die, the money goes to them.

297
00:27:07,214 --> 00:27:10,748
It goes on day in and day out.

298
00:27:10,948 --> 00:27:13,295
[It’s] nothing, it’s so mundane.

299
00:27:13,495 --> 00:27:15,729
That doesn’t mean I believe in divorces.

300
00:27:15,956 --> 00:27:19,709
Of course, that’s something nonsensical.

301
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:23,479
But to be married means just you have entered into life.

302
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,026
At least you should enter into life!

303
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:31,523
That is important as far as entering is concerned.

304
00:27:31,724 --> 00:27:39,325
Basisc. But that is just the basic, that’s not the end of life!

305
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:44,828
If you are a subtler person you will not think

306
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:49,380
what is your advantage monetarily, or what you are doing,

307
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,318
what is the thing, what gain you have got.

308
00:27:52,518 --> 00:27:56,638
Of course you will see that as yoga is established,

309
00:27:56,838 --> 00:28:01,451
your kshema will be established, your well-being will be established.

310
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:07,504
You will see that, clearly. It is to be seen,

311
00:28:07,704 --> 00:28:11,269
to be thankful.

312
00:28:11,469 --> 00:28:15,262
And the kshema is all right,

313
00:28:15,462 --> 00:28:24,185
because you should not have worry akshema,

314
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:29,974
but you should have free time to devote yourself

315
00:28:30,174 --> 00:28:34,169
to meditation and to Sahaj Yog:

316
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:38,513
so that you don’t have too much worry.

317
00:28:38,713 --> 00:28:40,935
That’s how the kshema comes in.

318
00:28:41,135 --> 00:28:44,943
But when the kshema comes in also, one may start

319
00:28:45,143 --> 00:28:49,672
going into the same circle of greediness,

320
00:28:49,872 --> 00:28:53,907
[of] having more and more money, more and more this,

321
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:58,556
better clothes, better house, [of] how to get this:

322
00:28:58,756 --> 00:29:02,772
this circle may start.

323
00:29:03,592 --> 00:29:07,345
There’s no end to it,

324
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:11,992
so you have to cut it down. I am not saying

325
00:29:12,192 --> 00:29:16,289
that you just have one dress

326
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:20,600
and all your life you end up with one dress;

327
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,327
it doesn’t mean that. Because you know if I say anything,

328
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:25,159
people will shoot off to the other end.

329
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,202
I am trying to keep it in the centre

330
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:31,585
[so] that not too much attention will be required on one side

331
00:29:31,785 --> 00:29:37,379
or on the other; of indulgences or of asceticism – none of these.

332
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:43,021
You are not to renounce anything or neither
you have to indulge into anything:

333
00:29:43,221 --> 00:29:49,016
but feel your subtleties, feed them, nourish them,

334
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:55,435
look after them. You should be proud of your subtleties:

335
00:29:56,849 --> 00:30:01,172
that you have these subtler values, while others don’t have,

336
00:30:01,372 --> 00:30:05,046
and that itself will be so self-sustaining

337
00:30:05,247 --> 00:30:09,520
that you can withhold all those values

338
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,363
that you get from your subtleties against the whole world.

339
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:19,483
Because the world is so fragmented,

340
00:30:19,683 --> 00:30:24,979
so cut off, that everybody feels lonely.

341
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:28,984
But that does not, by any chance, mean you should be arrogant

342
00:30:29,184 --> 00:30:34,570
to others, you should be fighting with others – no!

343
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:38,920
But in darkness a light shines.

344
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,389
The whole is darkness. If the light accepts the darkness,

345
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:46,881
then it becomes darkness! So the light must accept that:

346
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:53,863
“I am the light, and I am the path,” and should stand up.

347
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:59,781
That does not in any way mean any arrogance to others,

348
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:04,226
any showing-off to others, but it is the Light.

349
00:31:04,426 --> 00:31:10,076
And the Light, by itself, emits.

350
00:31:13,302 --> 00:31:19,669
When this happens to you,

351
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:25,107
you will not hate yourself first of all,

352
00:31:25,307 --> 00:31:29,266
but you will love and respect yourself

353
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:36,281
and respect the virtues in you and not your grossness.

354
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:41,003
Kundalini Itself makes you subtler and subtler.

355
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:47,016
But if you are a stone what can Kundalini do?

356
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,756
Now it is for you to see where you are stone.

357
00:31:56,956 --> 00:32:01,596
There should be a lot of heart searching.

358
00:32:02,596 --> 00:32:09,794
The greatest stone-age is nowadays.

359
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:13,723
Heart is like a stone!

360
00:32:13,923 --> 00:32:16,981
It doesn’t move.

361
00:32:17,181 --> 00:32:20,052
When talking to others,

362
00:32:20,253 --> 00:32:22,794
it doesn’t move.

363
00:32:23,013 --> 00:32:25,977
It has no ripple in it, there’s no joy in it.

364
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:30,456
It’s like a stone sitting there to hit everyone.

365
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:32,656
You see anybody sees you, “Oh Bala! He’s coming!

366
00:32:32,857 --> 00:32:34,857
Go from the other road!” “Who?”

367
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:39,078
“That fellow with the stone heart!”

368
00:32:40,811 --> 00:32:43,498
And you feel you are all right, you are a very good person

369
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:45,699
because you are stone hearted.

370
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,260
You think you can dominate the whole world because you are stone hearted,

371
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,762
you can give psychological treatments to others, keep quiet,

372
00:32:52,962 --> 00:32:56,262
don’t talk to anyone, shout at others and do whatever you please,

373
00:32:56,462 --> 00:32:59,908
because you have a stone heart.

374
00:33:00,551 --> 00:33:03,718
Nothing happens to your stone there.

375
00:33:03,918 --> 00:33:07,868
Now this stone heartedness

376
00:33:08,068 --> 00:33:16,058
is the sign that you should not be any more in Sahaj Yog.

377
00:33:17,926 --> 00:33:23,639
You must have a heart as your Mother has:

378
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:26,819
pulsating with love,

379
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:31,232
with compassion, with joy,

380
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:35,661
with happiness, with giving.

381
00:33:35,861 --> 00:33:40,858
That should be the attitude,

382
00:33:41,058 --> 00:33:44,124
not rationality, nothing.

383
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:48,593
It is the feeling:

384
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,967
feeling for the pains of others,

385
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:58,811
feeling for their longings and feeling for their aspirations.

386
00:33:59,011 --> 00:34:05,405
Just feeling them within yourself

387
00:34:05,605 --> 00:34:19,484
is their desire to be the Whole,

388
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:26,359
to be the Ocean Itself,

389
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,909
itself is so fulfilling.

390
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:37,724
We should not have our ideals among ourselves.

391
00:34:38,112 --> 00:34:40,156
Like, “She does this so why should I do?”

392
00:34:40,357 --> 00:34:44,795
“He does this so why should I do?” It’s very mediocre.

393
00:34:44,995 --> 00:34:50,400
It’s a very low-grade business to see others,

394
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,088
to worry about others, to talk about others.

395
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:58,985
It’s extremely low grade.

396
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:06,621
A person who is of a calibre

397
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:09,613
has his standards so much higher

398
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:16,313
that he cannot compare himself with others.

399
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:22,448
It’s really true. So, if I start comparing myself with you,

400
00:35:22,648 --> 00:35:26,120
what will be my position?

401
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,132
I mean, I can’t do it!

402
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,655
Then you will say, “It’s all right for you Mother!” It’s perfect,

403
00:35:34,855 --> 00:35:37,691
I agree, it’s all right for me as I am.

404
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:42,726
But you can be like me also.

405
00:35:48,054 --> 00:35:56,643
But if I start comparing and thinking, “Oh God, what is this?”

406
00:35:56,843 --> 00:36:00,087
then I should give up doing anything, thinking,

407
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:04,585
“Where have I come?”

408
00:36:05,272 --> 00:36:08,682
But when you know that

409
00:36:08,882 --> 00:36:13,897
you are not comparing, you are just giving.

410
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:20,409
The question of comparison should not arise at all,

411
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:22,971
at all.

412
00:36:23,171 --> 00:36:26,259
It’s just feeling.

413
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:29,618
I just feel.

414
00:36:29,818 --> 00:36:34,255
In the same way you feel each other.

415
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:40,845
Not in an artificial, courteous way:

416
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:43,126
[like] some people think that

417
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,409
if they have given their seat to someone

418
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:48,550
they have been really the generous people,

419
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:53,242
the greatest generous people!

420
00:36:55,787 --> 00:36:59,369
Just be yourself now: let’s see.

421
00:36:59,569 --> 00:37:03,986
Just be yourself, and that you are the Light.

422
00:37:04,186 --> 00:37:08,424
What is the comparison?

423
00:37:17,212 --> 00:37:23,697
The comparison exists when our calibre is low.

424
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:30,423
If it is 24 carat gold, what is the comparison?

425
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,759
It’s absolute.

426
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:37,215
If you are at an absolute point, there’s no comparison.

427
00:37:37,415 --> 00:37:42,598
So try to see that your calibre is that,

428
00:37:42,798 --> 00:37:46,471
that you are of that calibre

429
00:37:46,671 --> 00:37:49,425
and don’t worry about gross people.

430
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:51,608
Gross are gross [and] will remain gross:

431
00:37:51,824 --> 00:37:57,025
you just don’t worry about them. You [should] keep your calibre all right.

432
00:37:57,541 --> 00:38:03,463
And that is what is the most essential part of Sahaja Yoga.

433
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:07,789
Thank you very much.

434
00:38:11,494 --> 00:38:12,493
- Huh?

435
00:38:12,694 --> 00:38:15,032
They always tell me that You are actually God ,

436
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:19,217
the Father God Himself.

437
00:38:19,418 --> 00:38:21,283
Well I can’t see that at all.

438
00:38:21,483 --> 00:38:25,944
All right, now put your hand towards me. Ask the question.

439
00:38:27,124 --> 00:38:29,124
The simplest computer.

440
00:38:29,325 --> 00:38:33,812
Work out your computer and ask the question, finished.

441
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:41,197
That, “She is the ‘E’, means She is the One

442
00:38:41,397 --> 00:38:47,083
who is the desire of God Almighty.  the meaning?

443
00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:52,789
She is the power of God,

444
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:56,016
and it is only She who incarnates.”

445
00:38:56,216 --> 00:39:03,743
If you read the Vedas, it is said that She created Her child,

446
00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:14,974
and the first sound that was created was the child.

447
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:24,709
And that sound is the sound what we call as Brahma,

448
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:29,248
or the Logos, as they call it.

449
00:39:36,615 --> 00:39:41,615
So now, what is the difference between God and God’s desire?

450
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:46,425
What is the difference between sun and sunlight?

451
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:54,068
What is the difference between moon and moonlight?

452
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:59,343
What is the difference between the word and the meaning?

453
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:16,905
So the God Almighty whom people understand,

454
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:21,138
is just a witness.

455
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:27,307
The day these two things will meet, there won’t be any world left.

456
00:40:29,943 --> 00:40:34,141
Till they are separated, all these things happened.

457
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:40,084
When they meet, and merge into each other, there’s nothing left,

458
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:45,519
He just becomes the sound, Brahma.

459
00:40:56,049 --> 00:40:59,294
We cannot understand these things, because we have never seen

460
00:40:59,494 --> 00:41:04,284
two things [which are] that merged together as God and His Power.

461
00:41:04,484 --> 00:41:07,823
We cannot understand

462
00:41:08,023 --> 00:41:14,068
anything like that because there is no parallel.

463
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,358
Now, you can rationally also see things, that:

464
00:41:22,558 --> 00:41:25,132
people, when they bend before me,

465
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:28,441
their Kundalini starts moving.

466
00:41:28,642 --> 00:41:30,876
It is written in the scriptures [that]

467
00:41:31,077 --> 00:41:35,080
only at the feet of Adi Shakti this would happen.

468
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,952
Not only that, but you people

469
00:41:39,153 --> 00:41:43,307
who have not been to any austere life or anything,

470
00:41:43,507 --> 00:41:45,745
have got Realisation

471
00:41:45,956 --> 00:41:51,717
and that your own power is giving them Realisation. Isn’t it?

472
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:58,740
There is no one in the whole world today [

473
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,489
even though] there may be some realised-souls,

474
00:42:01,689 --> 00:42:05,543
who can give, the way you give, Realisation.

475
00:42:05,743 --> 00:42:09,864
You go and talk to some great gurus:

476
00:42:10,064 --> 00:42:12,742
they are jealous of you.

477
00:42:12,942 --> 00:42:17,914
They know who I am, they have told people who I am,

478
00:42:18,114 --> 00:42:21,140
but they are jealous.

479
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,340
They don’t understand why of all the things

480
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:26,541
I have given you these powers while they don’t have.

481
00:42:26,742 --> 00:42:28,742
They can’t give Realisation the way you give,

482
00:42:28,943 --> 00:42:31,842
in a second like this; nobody can.

483
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:34,528
You can go and have a look at them.

484
00:42:34,729 --> 00:42:38,529
They are great people no doubt.

485
00:42:38,729 --> 00:42:43,003
But your Kundalini works like a jet.

486
00:42:43,203 --> 00:42:48,909
They move like elephants,

487
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:51,666
from one chakra to another chakra.

488
00:42:51,866 --> 00:42:54,866
The Kundalini doesn’t move that way as it moves [in you],

489
00:42:55,067 --> 00:42:59,499
because I have given you the authority.

490
00:43:02,255 --> 00:43:07,211
You can go and meet them and they will tell you.

491
00:43:07,411 --> 00:43:11,204
There are thousands of people they have got [as] disciples,

492
00:43:11,404 --> 00:43:13,509
but they don’t send them to me.

493
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,710
They said, “Mother You will find your calibre [of people].

494
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:18,630
These gross people, you leave it to us.

495
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,845
We’ll manage them. We’ll send them later on.

496
00:43:21,046 --> 00:43:23,975
Just now you find your subtle people.”

497
00:43:24,175 --> 00:43:26,815
Why Sahaja Yogis are few [is] because there are

498
00:43:27,016 --> 00:43:29,694
very few subtle people in this world of that calibre.

499
00:43:29,894 --> 00:43:32,509
That’s why I am always requesting you that:

500
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,419
do not divert your attention here and there.

501
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:38,619
Settle down. Become good Sahaja Yogis. Unless and until

502
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,419
you really become good Sahaja Yogis

503
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,973
I cannot move to the second strata.

504
00:43:46,528 --> 00:43:48,653
Because the first strata is not yet settled down.

505
00:43:48,854 --> 00:43:51,125
They are worried about nonsensical things.

506
00:43:51,325 --> 00:43:56,641
I mean I just, sometimes, feel very unhappy to see that

507
00:43:56,841 --> 00:44:03,141
you fight among yourselves. This is something so painful,

508
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:05,291
that you say harsh words to each other.

509
00:44:05,492 --> 00:44:11,089
I mean you are the cream for me.

510
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,131
You go and ask any one of the gurus,

511
00:44:17,332 --> 00:44:23,936
if they can move the Kundalini on their fingers as you do!

512
00:44:26,862 --> 00:44:31,919
These powers cannot be given by an ordinary person.

513
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:36,896
I look ordinary, no doubt; I have to.

514
00:44:37,096 --> 00:44:42,064
But also you have seen me in other forms;

515
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:45,264
that’s not important.

516
00:44:45,506 --> 00:44:48,009
The important thing is [that] you should see your own transformation

517
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:52,140
and how many powers are manifesting.

518
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:54,530
If you go and tell somebody that,

519
00:44:54,731 --> 00:44:57,542
“I have started giving Realisation and raising Kundalini.”

520
00:44:57,742 --> 00:45:02,257
They will say, “You are mad! How can it be? Impossible!”

521
00:45:02,457 --> 00:45:04,425
Nobody is going to believe you at all.

522
00:45:04,626 --> 00:45:07,173
You have got it so easily:

523
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:12,454
why? Because I recognise certain subtleties in you.

524
00:45:16,754 --> 00:45:19,457
These gurus recognise me. They know about me.

525
00:45:19,658 --> 00:45:21,937
They know who I am. They are telling others.

526
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:25,911
There are so many of them like that.

527
00:45:26,216 --> 00:45:29,195
I told you the story of the lady here, American lady.

528
00:45:29,395 --> 00:45:32,453
She might come sometimes. I think you met her isn’t it?

529
00:45:32,653 --> 00:45:36,437
Some of you have met her. She went to Rangoon

530
00:45:36,637 --> 00:45:41,421
and there she went to meet some very great, high soul

531
00:45:41,621 --> 00:45:45,230
who was living on a mountain and he would not meet many people.

532
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:49,628
But she went there and he really respected her.

533
00:45:49,828 --> 00:45:51,906
And when she came in he said,

534
00:45:52,107 --> 00:45:56,566
“I am going to sit at a lower level than yours.”

535
00:45:56,766 --> 00:45:59,766
So she could not understand. He said,

536
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:03,201
“Because you have seen Mother with your own eyes. I haven’t.

537
00:46:03,401 --> 00:46:08,393
I will have to die to come and see Her again.”

538
00:46:10,921 --> 00:46:14,788
And then she was surprised.

539
00:46:17,187 --> 00:46:21,065
But first of all know that you have got these powers within you.

540
00:46:21,265 --> 00:46:24,265
Then know that you have got them

541
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:29,172
because I have chosen you.

542
00:46:34,214 --> 00:46:37,490
All right? Good!

543
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:40,300
See now!

544
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,309
Only thing: you get rid of your egos, which give you ideas.

545
00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:48,372
You see sometimes they come like big balloons!

546
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:53,713
So tell yourself, “Oh mister ego, please get out!

547
00:46:54,129 --> 00:47:01,866
These powers I have got because Mother has chosen me,

548
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:07,943
has loved me, has nourished me

549
00:47:08,144 --> 00:47:13,775
and has accepted me as Her child.”

550
00:47:14,572 --> 00:47:17,583
 It’s a fact!

551
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,204
Nobody can believe that you can give Realisation I tell you.

552
00:47:21,404 --> 00:47:24,352
You go and tell anybody.

553
00:47:24,552 --> 00:47:31,004
You should! But they are not going to believe you.

554
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:39,466
If this flowers says that, “I can become

555
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:43,099
the lamp in the lighthouse.”

556
00:47:43,299 --> 00:47:47,425
Nobody’s going to believe it,

557
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:51,003
because the light in the lighthouse is made in a special factory

558
00:47:51,203 --> 00:47:53,800
with a special this, and a special that.

559
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,550
But supposing this flower says so, or if this flower says that,

560
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:03,401
“I can cure your diseases.”

561
00:48:03,601 --> 00:48:08,547
Nobody would believe; but it may.

562
00:48:11,586 --> 00:48:16,659
When something fantastic happens

563
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:20,781
you have to believe that there is Divine acting

564
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:25,661
and acting so dynamically.

565
00:48:34,063 --> 00:48:39,129
Only thing [is]: do not waste your energies in gross hankerings

566
00:48:39,329 --> 00:48:44,225
and gross wanderings and ramblings.

567
00:48:44,897 --> 00:48:48,916
Try to be subtler and subtler.

568
00:48:49,116 --> 00:48:54,365
There is nothing that I have to ask for.

569
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:59,037
Now you think about it from God’s point of view.

570
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:01,622
You are to be given Realisation: first job.

571
00:49:01,822 --> 00:49:06,585
It’s a headache you know!

572
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,346
Somebody has to take up the headache of giving Realisation.

573
00:49:10,546 --> 00:49:13,956
It is much easier to be crucified once,

574
00:49:14,156 --> 00:49:18,402
but to be giving Realisation hundred times,

575
00:49:18,602 --> 00:49:24,219
to all kinds of funny Kundalinis to be raised,

576
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:27,255
you cannot imagine!

577
00:49:27,456 --> 00:49:32,017
And then after giving Realisation to tell you all about it:

578
00:49:32,217 --> 00:49:35,217
to decode all the chakras, to show you all the chakras,

579
00:49:35,418 --> 00:49:39,546
to tell you all about Deities, these archetypes and everything.

580
00:49:39,746 --> 00:49:46,108
And every word of it is true and acts and works.

581
00:49:46,308 --> 00:49:50,436
You have experimented and found out.

582
00:49:50,636 --> 00:49:54,927
Somebody has to come down.

583
00:49:55,896 --> 00:50:02,344
It has been my lot to come.

584
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:05,255
I don’t mind, as I told the other day,

585
00:50:05,455 --> 00:50:07,927
any one of you takes my seat I’ll be very happy

586
00:50:08,127 --> 00:50:12,927
to be a Sahaja Yogi sitting down like that!

587
00:50:13,127 --> 00:50:17,701
Really, I tell you! I will be the happiest person.

588
00:50:17,901 --> 00:50:22,240
 I’ll give you five garlands like this

589
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,868
and all the flowers from the market I will bring for you,

590
00:50:27,068 --> 00:50:34,005
if you could sit here and do the job for me.

591
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:39,868
It’s very easy to doubt, but can you do the job?

592
00:50:40,068 --> 00:50:42,727
No, you cannot.

593
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:46,716
This is the trouble with the Western mind is,

594
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:49,857
that it doubts.

595
00:50:50,057 --> 00:50:52,997
What are you doubting about?

596
00:50:53,197 --> 00:50:57,316
What is there to doubt?

597
00:50:58,144 --> 00:51:03,131
I cannot doubt myself, that’s very difficult.

598
00:51:03,331 --> 00:51:08,026
When you know that this is the tea, how can you doubt?

599
00:51:08,226 --> 00:51:13,616
Now if you doubt, what can I do? How to prove it?

600
00:51:17,799 --> 00:51:24,252
Best way is to understand my love.

601
00:51:25,463 --> 00:51:29,103
Through that you will understand me better.

602
00:51:29,303 --> 00:51:34,502
It’s much easier to understand me through your heart

603
00:51:34,702 --> 00:51:41,786
than through your brains, because I am very good at blasting them;

604
00:51:41,986 --> 00:51:44,560
and I play about with you, lots of things,

605
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:51,421
 by which I really give you a very difficult time.

606
00:51:51,621 --> 00:51:54,913
Because if you start thinking, I make you think more.

607
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:58,803
If you start doubting, I make you doubt more.

608
00:51:59,003 --> 00:52:04,171
So best thing is to see. As I told the other day that,

609
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,851
whatever is in the next room, it’s better to go and see

610
00:52:07,051 --> 00:52:11,687
than to sit down here and doubt,

611
00:52:11,887 --> 00:52:16,467
or to accept it and sit down here. No! Go and see for yourself.

612
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,667
And you have seen it yourself.

613
00:52:18,868 --> 00:52:22,467
But just think how tremendous it is.

614
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:26,047
Just sit down and think,

615
00:52:26,247 --> 00:52:30,250
how great it is, how dynamic it is!

616
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:35,349
That you have seen it with your own eyes!

617
00:52:35,896 --> 00:52:40,115
Just think,

618
00:52:43,506 --> 00:52:50,026
that you have felt it. That you are the people who have got it.

619
00:52:50,226 --> 00:52:54,637
You are the first few who have known it.

620
00:52:54,837 --> 00:52:57,704
There may be thousands and thousands later

621
00:52:57,905 --> 00:53:01,723
and the whole universe may take it up, but you are the first few.

622
00:53:01,923 --> 00:53:04,114
Improve your calibre.

623
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,454
Come up!

624
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,675
I think if you can give me leave, I would like to go

625
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:24,393
because the whole day I have been really working very hard.

626
00:53:24,593 --> 00:53:28,908
I did my cooking and did that. Now, what’s the matter with you?

627
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:33,675
You, still more? Still more?

628
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:41,500
Better! Keep like that! All right. Now can I take your leave?
