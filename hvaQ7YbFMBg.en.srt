1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:19,630
I welcome 
all of you from abroad, and this Kolhapur

2
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:32,800
is regarded as one of the deities’ temple,
which have three-and-a-half deities, or you

3
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:41,170
can say three-and-a-half coils of the Kundalini,
so it is said that, in this triangular bone

4
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:54,170
of Maharashtra - because it is surrounded
by, on all three sides by mountains, and the

5
00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:06,360
plateau is in the center so the all the three
sides make a nice triangle - is the 

6
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:21,009
Kundalini of the whole universe, of the whole
world, is expressed by Mother Earth in Maharashtra.

7
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:27,789
These are three-and-a-half energies, which
are coiled together.

8
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:32,079
The first one is of Mahakali.

9
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:46,810
This Mahakali power is expressed in Tuljapur
as Bhavani, and Shivaji Maharaj used to come

10
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:55,590
on a horse all the way for miles together,
to get the darshan of this Bhavani at Tuljapur:

11
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:04,079
he knew this; and he had a sword which was
called as Bhavani talwar, and people said

12
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:12,599
that the Goddess Herself has given this sword
to him.

13
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:19,010
Now the second one is Mahasaraswati, is at
Mahurgadh.

14
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:32,810
We always sing Mahurgadawari song, that is
the one is Mahasaraswati, which is 

15
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,709
also called as Renuka Devi, that’s the right-sided
Mahasaraswati.

16
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:46,769
Then the third one is Mahalakshmi, that is
at Kolhapur.

17
00:02:46,769 --> 00:03:00,549
Here a very bad demon called Kolasur was killed
by the Mother, so this place is specially

18
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:12,239
very holy for all of us; because you got your
Realization as the Kundalini went through

19
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:20,360
your Sushumna nadi, which is being nourished
by Mahalakshmi principle.

20
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,940
So in the Temple they sit down - it’s a
Mahalakshmi’s Temple, but they sing that:

21
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,519
“Oh Ambe, please rise, please rise, please
rise.”

22
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:42,519
This comes with the full understanding of
the Sushumna nadi, but ninety-nine-point-nine

23
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:53,810
percent people don’t know, because all the
knowledge about Shakti is being lost due to

24
00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:01,379
the different timings, and people never worried
about it.

25
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:27,060
So, one has to realize that in Indian shastras,
scriptures, Shakti is the most important thing.

26
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:41,450
It is to be understood why: because, say now,
if you have a light or if you have fire, what

27
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,180
is the power of fire?

28
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:51,320
The power of fire can be that it can give
you light, it can burn away things, but supposing

29
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,260
it does not have its power, then who’ll
care for fire?

30
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,090
Nothing.

31
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:14,010
So anybody who hasn’t got the power of being
the Spirit, it is useless.

32
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:23,440
So this power, this Shakti, has to be awakened
within us, because we do not have the power

33
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,610
of the Spirit.

34
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,700
We have to have the power of the Spirit.

35
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,120
That’s only possible if you get your Self
Realization.

36
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,640
That is the reason it is very important that
we should pay attention to our power.

37
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,610
Now this power is made as the power of a Mother.

38
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:55,680
Mother is the most loving relationship, and
through that relationship all the love is

39
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,820
expressed.

40
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:10,500
That is why the Shakti is that of a Mother,
and the affection, the love, the patience

41
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:17,160
that Mother has for Her children, the Shakti
too has the same powers, you see, and that

42
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,800
is how this Shakti never can harm you.

43
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:32,160
Out of all these Shaktis, all these powers,
highest of all is what we call as the Kundalini,

44
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,130
because without Her you cannot get Realization.

45
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:42,430
But also we can say, higher than that, or
complementary to that, is Mahalakshmi power.

46
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,190
Without the Mahalakshmi you cannot rise.

47
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:51,410
This is the ladder through which this power
of Kundalini can rise.

48
00:06:51,410 --> 00:07:01,580
So both the powers are very important and
very much related to each other.

49
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,230
Mahalakshmi principle starts when we have
finished with Lakshmi principle.

50
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:12,490
Like in the West, people are fed up with affluence,
fed up with all the riches and all that, so

51
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,521
they are thinking: “What have we achieved?

52
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:18,310
We have gone into imbalances, so what should
we do?

53
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,380
We have to balance ourselves.”

54
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,020
So how do we balance ourselves?

55
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,150
We have to have the knowledge of the Spirit.

56
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,940
That is called as aadhyatma.

57
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,870
You have to know what is the knowledge of
the Spirit, and to know the knowledge of the

58
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:40,720
Spirit Kundalini has to be awakened, and that
you are to be connected to this all-pervading

59
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,520
Power.

60
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:54,800
Once that happens, you just become one with
that energy and you get transformation within

61
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:02,010
yourself, because there is light and in the
light you can see all your problems, all your

62
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:07,280
defects; and also if you know how to correct
it, is the easiest thing to do is to get transformation

63
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,840
in Sahaja Yoga.

64
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,190
All of you have been very much transformed,
and now I find it difficult even to recognize

65
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:20,850
you, because all your faces are changed, your
attitudes are changed, you look so different,

66
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,790
so beautiful.

67
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:37,340
Today it seems to be a special day for Me,
here in Mahalakshmi Temple, that Mahalakshmi

68
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:45,950
is being awakened, and I’m feeling really
in that state of thoughtless awareness.

69
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:53,420
I don’t know how I’m talking; and I am
merged just in the meditative mood, absolutely

70
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,710
into meditative mood.

71
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:04,460
Because when you are in the center you don’t
think, you are in meditation.

72
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,450
That is why Mahalakshmi is very important.

73
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:18,070
So when you are fed up, you can feel there’s
something missing, and then you take to Mahalakshmi

74
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,500
principle.

75
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,210
But in India because of so many saints, we
feel that we should short-circuit it.

76
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:37,380
First let us develop our own aadhyatma, let
us develop our knowledge of atma and then

77
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:44,510
take to science, so there is no more imbalance
within us; because without the foundation

78
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:51,350
of aadhyatma, knowledge of the Spirit, you
take to any kind of progress, you can topple

79
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,350
down.

80
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:59,180
That’s why all the Western entrepreneurs,
enterprises and also projections of religion

81
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,860
have gone to waste, because there has been
no balance.

82
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,370
It is important that we must have the balance
within ourselves.

83
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:20,260
Now in India we have people who have this
idea, at least that you have to rise higher

84
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:31,230
than materialism and that you have to become
one with the Virata, part and parcel of the

85
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,230
whole.

86
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:38,130
This they know, and that’s what, by knowing
that, once they get to Sahaja Yoga, they grow

87
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:45,840
very deeply; the depth, the depth they have
achieved with this faith, that we have to

88
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:53,700
be self-realized, and that we have to feel
the all-pervading Power.

89
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:59,750
This conviction itself gives them the depth
and so when they achieve Realization, they

90
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,470
just go down very deep.

91
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:08,430
But most surprising, people who have never
heard about Ganesha, who have never heard

92
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:15,680
about Kolhapur, have never heard about Mahalakshmi
are sometimes much, much better, much more

93
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:22,270
deeper than the people who know all these
things by heart.

94
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:30,970
So one can deduct that those who know outwardly,
those who know through their books, or through

95
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:37,160
some gurus who teach them something, are absolutely
outside.

96
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:48,890
They have nothing in them to tell us because
they have had no experience of the Self, no

97
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:52,920
experience of the Self.

98
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:01,410
That’s only possible when your Kundalini
rises and breaks your Brahmarandra.

99
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:07,779
That is the time the first experience comes
to you of this all-pervading Power.

100
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:17,040
So all those people who have been only just
praying to Mahalakshmi, have been going to

101
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:26,360
Her, doing a lot of penances, fasting, this,
that, have no idea as to what Mahalakshmi

102
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:33,230
wants, and they always complain to Me: “Mother,
we have done this, we have done that.”

103
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,440
People are very religious.

104
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,250
They are doing all kinds of ritualism, what
we call as karmakanda, but with that you do

105
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:45,250
not reach where you have to reach.

106
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:53,150
So one has to understand that whatever has
been written and told about all these great

107
00:12:53,150 --> 00:13:02,370
things in India, people may know in words,
but in experience they do not know.

108
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:08,630
So Sahaja Yoga is very important to give them
this experience, so that they can really verify

109
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:20,960
whatever is said in the science of spirituality
about getting Realization, is absolutely true.

110
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:27,089
Not only that but it’s very practical, and
every person who gets Realization can understand

111
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:32,040
it very well.

112
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,240
So we are here in a very holy place, full
of unholy people.

113
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:49,450
But still there are some very, very good people
here also, and because of Mahalakshmi, they

114
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:58,970
make very good ornaments because these ornaments
are offered to the Goddess.

115
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:09,490
You can feel there a kind of a subdued feeling
for God, feeling for spirituality, but they

116
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:16,940
do not have the experience that you have got,
so you are much higher than all of them.

117
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,040
And those who have the experience can feel
more, once they go to the Temple, if you can

118
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,690
go to the Temple to see the place also; but
give yourself a big bandhan because I have

119
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,920
seen it, next to the deity there are very
funny people sitting.

120
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,950
They’re doing all kinds of commercial activities.

121
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,490
They are selling flowers, they are selling
this, selling everything.

122
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,220
So you have to be careful, with a bandhan
you can go and see for yourself.

123
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:53,830
Now they say that this Temple is made because
it’s a swayambhu – it’s the one that

124
00:14:53,830 --> 00:15:01,560
has come out of Mother Earth – you can see
yourself if there are vibrations and moreover,

125
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:09,290
you must know that this puja of these deities
are done by people who are not at all in any

126
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:16,220
way religious, but are just commercial people.

127
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:26,010
Commercialism can never give you any satisfaction,
can never give you at all any satisfaction.

128
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:37,040
Apart from that it can take you to something
unknown, of dangerous shores.

129
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:49,120
But if your faith is pure, without any greed,
without any demands, then you develop your

130
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:58,390
depth within yourself; which is very helpful
after Sahaja Yoga.

131
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:11,470
It’s a remarkable thing how this Shri Chakra
is here and how they have made the complete

132
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,490
calculation of Shri Chakra.

133
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:24,630
I met a scientist in Russia, in Moscow, who
has done a research, very much big research

134
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,050
on this Shri Chakra.

135
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:33,700
Now, so we have Shri Chakra on the right side,
on the left-hand side we have Lalita Chakra,

136
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:46,360
so all the things that we do with hands after
Realization are worked through, on the right-hand

137
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,610
side Shri Chakra, on the left-hand side Lalita
Chakra.

138
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:58,170
Now how it works is a very complicated thing,
but we don’t have to worry about that.

139
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:04,630
As soon as you put your hand on somebody,
the chakra knows how to work it out.

140
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:12,899
It works by itself, as if it is a built-in
mechanism within us, which knows what sort

141
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:18,559
of vibrations to be given to a particular
person for a particular cause, or a particular

142
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,860
purpose.

143
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:29,289
If that person has certain defects also, these
chakras know what is to be emitted, how to

144
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:31,309
work it out.

145
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:41,299
So it is not that we have the Kundalini awakening
only, these chakras are awakened, we also

146
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:47,159
have these two chakras awakened within us
because of Kundalini.

147
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:53,049
But if you have Vishuddi problem, then you
can find that your hands are stiff and you

148
00:17:53,049 --> 00:18:07,289
cannot feel guidance, or you can say, the
Divine intentions of Realization; because

149
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:11,549
when you start using your hands you don’t
feel any vibrations, so how will you know

150
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,789
what’s happening?

151
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:20,160
It’s a very complicated thing, and for that
complicated thing these instruments are made

152
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,559
already, are prepared already; they are quite
equipped with all the knowledge that is necessary,

153
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:34,129
like a feedback as you call it, or we can
call it a complete programming is there.

154
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:41,789
So as soon as you put your hand on a person,
the programming starts working it out.

155
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:48,440
Because it is programming is done by God Almighty,
it can never be wrong.

156
00:18:48,440 --> 00:19:01,679
It cannot be two different things, as far
as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

157
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:14,980
I have been thinking about writing about all
these big, big peethas that are in India,

158
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:22,840
so it will be helpful to you as well as to
others in India.

159
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:30,259
But here the atmosphere is so bad, as if to
think of God, to talk of God is absolutely

160
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:34,090
wrong, you cannot say.

161
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:43,139
The people are in illusion, and they think
that all these talks has brought us nothing.

162
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:57,740
To them it is the progress of the West is
more effective, more apparent, that they can

163
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:05,720
see how you have progressed in materialism,
and they can’t understand how we could progress

164
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:18,539
with aadhyatma very much in the area of physical
development or mental development.

165
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:25,450
So now we come to a point where we realize
that it is very important for all the Western

166
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:32,580
people to have the foundation of aadhyatma.

167
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:42,129
For that it is important to give up some of
your conditionings, because this knowledge

168
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:45,639
is coming definitely from India.

169
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:51,200
I mean the Indians had all the knowledge of
your medical science, this science, that science,

170
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
that science.

171
00:20:52,200 --> 00:21:02,690
But God’s science is in India, and for that,
what are you going to do?

172
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:09,029
When the question of God’s science is concerned,
what are you going to do about it?

173
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:15,769
How are you going to work it out, that this
is the science of God, and the God’s science

174
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:26,200
has to be understood with full dedication
and devotion?

175
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:34,009
Because of the conditioning of the Western
influence, the Western progress, sometimes

176
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:43,799
we just do not know how to grasp this knowledge
within ourselves; very difficult.

177
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:51,250
But if you can understand that, as for science
we had to accept it fully from the West, you

178
00:21:51,250 --> 00:22:00,750
have to accept the knowledge of your Spirit
from the East, East has the knowledge of the

179
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:06,970
Spirit: for that you have to be ready to receive
it.

180
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,460
But if you are still in your arrogance, if
you are still in your own conditionings, then

181
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,580
you cannot do it.

182
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:23,879
Like a boy who comes from a village, who has
never known about science, and you suddenly

183
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:27,909
put him in a science college, he’ll say:
“What is this nonsense, what’s all this

184
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:28,909
all?

185
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:30,039
I have never known these things.

186
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:33,799
Why should I use a test tube, why should I
go in the laboratory?”

187
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:39,860
All kinds of things he can start saying, and
this conditioning is there.

188
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,169
Then he’ll run away from school within one
year or two year, maybe earlier, and that

189
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:58,659
is what I find is their conditioning, which
turns away many people from Sahaja Yoga after

190
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:01,879
some time.

191
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:06,669
So we must watch our conditionings, what sort
of conditionings we have; while the Indians

192
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:13,489
have conditionings of so-called religious
beliefs and this ritualism, this, that, they

193
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:17,169
are very much conditioned also.

194
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:22,669
But is easy to overcome that when you realize
that whatever your worship: for example, in

195
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:31,549
India everybody has a kuladevata, means the
family’s goddess, everybody has; they must

196
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:35,789
worship that goddess, particular goddess,
everybody has.

197
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:43,859
So they have to, if they just ask: “Mother,
are You that Goddess?” the vibrations start

198
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:44,859
flowing.

199
00:23:44,859 --> 00:24:03,269
So the conditioning gets very easily eradicated,
but the mental acceptance of something is

200
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:05,789
very difficult to go.

201
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:13,419
And I’ve seen also when they get married
or marriage is arranged, they go mental.

202
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:14,419
They go mental.

203
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:22,559
If you go mental, then you cannot understand
many things.

204
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,809
But if you are spiritual, then you can understand.

205
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:30,899
For example, we see Mother Earth giving us
these flowers and all that, how can we go

206
00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:31,899
mental about it?

207
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:32,899
It’s a living process.

208
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:36,259
For any living process we cannot get mental.

209
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:40,730
So now you will say: “All right, this is
because of seed has got this, and the seed

210
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,399
is planted”; but how, why?

211
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,509
That you can’t answer, can never answer.

212
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:47,879
Then you’ll keep quiet.

213
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:54,859
But say if there’s a sage, he’ll say:
“All right, this is Mother Earth, She wants

214
00:24:54,859 --> 00:25:03,600
to give to Her children, these flowers, fruits,
these trees, so She’s working it out.”

215
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:12,179
So one has to jump from one conditioning of
materialism.

216
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:17,950
Now you should see in matter, energy never
moves.

217
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:23,149
Energy is stationary, it never moves.

218
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:30,889
And also energies which are moving, so-called,
like electricity, this, that, are absolutely

219
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:32,369
blind.

220
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:37,150
Supposing there is electricity here flowing,
all right, well and good, but supposing somebody

221
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,710
stops it, it will stop.

222
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,649
It has no mind, it is a mindless thing.

223
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:46,989
So in materialism you become mindless.

224
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:52,000
You start seeing also that within yourself,
that you have become mindless; and becoming

225
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:03,299
absolutely, absolutely, I should say, like
robots sometimes, which is mindless, which

226
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,640
is fixed, fixed quantity.

227
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,899
And I see very much clearly, in the West I’ve
seen, that people have very fixed ideas.

228
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:19,429
It’s difficult for them to get out of it
because they don’t have that movement towards

229
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:31,870
the spiritual subtlety, where one can use
the mind to do something.

230
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,659
We would say that Mother Earth has got the
mind.

231
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:40,380
Now that nobody can believe in the West, except
for Sahaja Yogis.

232
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:47,559
That the Mother Earth produces these vigrahas,
She produces these deities, nobody will believe.

233
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:53,100
How can you believe such a thing, that this
Mother Earth thinks, that this Mother Earth

234
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,379
produces these things?

235
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:58,389
But logically you can see, logically.

236
00:26:58,389 --> 00:26:59,389
Logically.

237
00:26:59,389 --> 00:27:07,470
Say a tree has a certain height, the fruits
have a certain shape, certain colors, flowers

238
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:13,200
same: who changes all the seasons, specially
in India is very clear-cut six seasons?

239
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,900
It’s called as Ritambhara pragya in the
Hatha Yoga.

240
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:27,350
Now that is the One which is a Lady, which
thinks.

241
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:36,210
She has a mind of Her own, She decides and
She works out everything.

242
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:46,320
This concept was doubly denied in the West,
is first is that they cannot accept a Goddess.

243
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,499
Woman has no part.

244
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:56,499
Right from Socrates onward, nobody has talked
much about a Woman, except of course there

245
00:27:56,499 --> 00:28:01,190
is Athena and all that, but it’s very minor
roles they have.

246
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:09,860
Greeks had goddesses who were just like human
beings, so that also gets ruled out, and very

247
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:14,999
little was accepted; and when Christianity
came, somehow or other Christians saw to it

248
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:19,779
that there should be no mention of the Mother
in any way.

249
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:22,871
But despite that, people worshipped the Mother.

250
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:27,950
They worshipped the Mother of Christ as, some
like a Goddess; though in the Bible She’s

251
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:37,479
talked as a “woman”, in a very derogatory
style She’s addressed.

252
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:47,269
So the conditioning of people is about the
power of God who hangs somewhere in the air,

253
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:58,289
that He’s there and that He gives us everything;
but what is the communication?

254
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:02,419
What is the justification or what is the logical
thing, how to explain?

255
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:04,340
So you have to say: “It is a mystery.

256
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,669
God is a mystery.

257
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:07,350
He hangs somewhere in the air.

258
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,350
He does everything.”

259
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,289
And how can people believe in it?

260
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:17,249
So the Christian conditioning has been even
worse than, I think, Jew conditioning because

261
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:21,249
they just took it out, Christ’s Mother,
away; though the painters, artists wouldn’t

262
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:25,690
do that, they wouldn’t accept: they had
the Mother there.

263
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:30,593
But despite all that, the Motherhood has not
been respected that should have been, in the

264
00:29:30,593 --> 00:29:40,419
Bible, which is a very wrong thing, while
Mahalakshmi Herself incarnated as Mother Mary

265
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:41,419
Herself.

266
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:47,679
And to say about Mahalakshmi as “a woman”,
I think is a great insult.

267
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,489
And where women are insulted like this, where
the Goddesses are insulted, we cannot expect

268
00:29:53,489 --> 00:30:02,220
any spiritual growth unless and until you
accept that it’s the Shakti, is the Motherhood,

269
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:12,320
who is the only thing that’s the communication
between us and the Divinity.

270
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,360
So this conditioning, Christian conditioning
has to go out, as far as the Motherhood is

271
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
concerned.

272
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,440
It’s very surprising sometimes when I see
how these people have tried to bring down

273
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:33,320
the level of a Goddess to just a woman.

274
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:41,379
So this is a very big blessing in India, that
they respect Mother as the Shakti, and that

275
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:47,440
the whole thing is done by the movement of
the Shakti, by the thinking of the Shakti,

276
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,840
by the coordination and the understanding
and the planning of the Shakti only.

277
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:58,619
It’s not done by God Almighty, He’s just
a spectator.

278
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:00,729
She does everything.

279
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:07,789
Once that concept can fit into your heads
properly, then you will see so many conditionings

280
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:14,249
will drop out; because religion was organized,
and in an organized religion you can put whatever

281
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:18,259
you like, the way you want to put it, and
it was such a big mistake.

282
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:30,999
By that people developed a lot of ego, lot
of things against women, and also the first

283
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:38,350
sin they call the “original sin” and all
that is because of a woman, they really ill-treated

284
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:42,679
women and they have no respect for them.

285
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:48,760
So the women have changed their role, and
instead of becoming mothers and goddesses,

286
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:55,599
they have tried to become something like actresses.

287
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:04,779
But you can understand that without the power
there is no sense in anything, and this is

288
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:09,989
the power of Love and this is the power of
Truth.

289
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:20,389
And once you get that power we should humble
down, and know that this power is within us,

290
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:26,759
which has given us all this knowledge, which
has given us all this ability to raise the

291
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,039
Kundalini.

292
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:32,200
All this is because of energy within us, the
Shakti within us.

293
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,281
Without that we are nothing.

294
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:44,429
And that too is the Mother who has done it.

295
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:55,669
I do not know how much to press this point,
but it’s important; because I find, specially

296
00:32:55,669 --> 00:33:03,820
in England some newspaper people came: “How
do you feel as a guru, as a woman?”

297
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:14,210
I mean, it’s a kind of a thing, “a woman”,
as if I am sort of a, that movement where

298
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:19,409
women are starting a fight with the men, sort
of a thing, and now: “This is another guru

299
00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:24,529
who is a woman, so She should be supported,”
or some sort of a nonsense like that.

300
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:29,990
It’s the only the Mother who does this job,
so there’s no question of asking such a

301
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,169
question.

302
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:40,729
But that’s what it is, that we should first
know that it’s the feminine quality of a

303
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:50,369
woman as a mother, is very powerful.

304
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:59,950
But we should encourage it and try to develop
it, so that spiritually you can communicate,

305
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:06,210
spiritually you can imbibe these qualities
for your own children.

306
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:15,659
The mothers who do not have aadhyatma can
never develop good children with proper emotions,

307
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:25,940
with proper value system of morality.

308
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:33,950
So it is very important for every mother to
be very proud that they are mothers, and for

309
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:39,520
girls who are going to be mothers to be very
proud that they are going to be mothers, and

310
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,039
that they represent the Shakti.

311
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:51,079
So now then, what is the part of the men is
to take full advantage of that power, by understanding

312
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:57,230
it, by complementing, by looking after that
power.

313
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,730
I’m not talking only about your wives.

314
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:11,000
I’m talking about your sisters, your daughters,
your mothers, and the whole society, where

315
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,840
women are to be respected, and they have to
be respectable.

316
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:22,349
And women should try to be respectable, to
try to know that they are the powers and they

317
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:27,650
are the ones who will be used by this Divine
power as channels, more than men.

318
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:34,570
But if they are useless, then of course they
wouldn’t bother about them, they would like

319
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:38,000
to bother then about men, much more than what
you are.

320
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,329
So it is important to understand what is your
role in Sahaja Yoga.

321
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:45,210
This is your role in Sahaja Yoga.

322
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,250
And I am sure you can work it out.

323
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,130
You can manage this part.

324
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:58,270
You can equip yourself for this role, which
is so beautiful and so good.

325
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:04,819
So much can be said about Mahalakshmi, and
there’s no end to it, but I think later

326
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:10,520
on we should keep this program on every year,
and you all should come to Mahalakshmi Temple

327
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:17,220
here, to the, I mean the Kolhapur, and then
I’ll again tell you all about the Mother’s

328
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,270
qualities, what She is as Mahalakshmi.

329
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:29,420
And today we’ll have the Shri Sukta.

330
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:38,819
Shri Sukta is about Mahalakshmi’s qualities.

331
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:44,819
I think we’ll have Ganesha Stuthi and then
we’ll have this.

332
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:49,619
So seriously you must understand what is it…

333
00:36:49,619 --> 00:37:11,470
I’m just in meditative mood today, I don’t
know what I’m talking; because this Mahalakshmi

334
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:17,290
is a thing that goes, finishes everything
else.

335
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:22,080
Left, right is finished now, you are just
in Mahalakshmi state: what to do?

336
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:28,950
“Mahalakshmi state” means nirvichar, nirvikalp,
beyond that, I don’t know what stages it

337
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,950
is.

338
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:37,619
It comes down a little bit, then again it
goes back to 

339
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:38,619
the same.

340
00:37:38,619 --> 00:38:08,890
