1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:09,700
I welcome 
all of you from abroad, and this Kolhapur
is regarded as one of the deities’ temple,

2
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:31,260
which have three-and-a-half deities, or you
can say three-and-a-half coils of the Kundalini,

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
so it is said that, in this triangular bone
of Maharashtra - because it is surrounded

4
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:51,150
by, on all three sides by mountains, and the
plateau is in the center so the all the three

5
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:03,420
sides make a nice triangle - is the 
Kundalini of the whole universe, of the whole
world, is expressed by Mother Earth in Maharashtra.

6
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:28,009
These are three-and-a-half energies, which
are coiled together. The first one is of Mahakali.

7
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:39,079
This Mahakali power is expressed in Tuljapur
as Bhavani, and Shivaji Maharaj used to come

8
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:53,810
on a horse all the way for miles together,
to get the darshan of this Bhavani at Tuljapur:

9
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,590
he knew this; and he had a sword which was
called as Bhavani talwar, and people said

10
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:11,079
that the Goddess Herself has given this sword
to him. Now the second one is Mahasaraswati,

11
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:24,750
is at Mahurgadh. We always sing Mahurgadawari
song, that is the one is Mahasaraswati, which

12
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:31,750
is 
also called as Renuka Devi, that’s the right-sided
Mahasaraswati. Then the third one is Mahalakshmi,

13
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:52,019
that is at Kolhapur. Here a very bad demon
called Kolasur was killed by the Mother, so

14
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:06,540
this place is specially very holy for all
of us; because you got your Realization as

15
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:15,299
the Kundalini went through your Sushumna nadi,
which is being nourished by Mahalakshmi principle.

16
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:26,939
So in the Temple they sit down - it’s a
Mahalakshmi’s Temple, but they sing that:

17
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:33,939
“Oh Ambe, please rise, please rise, please
rise.” This comes with the full understanding

18
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:45,629
of the Sushumna nadi, but ninety-nine-point-nine
percent people don’t know, because all the

19
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:54,989
knowledge about Shakti is being lost due to
the different timings, and people never worried

20
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:01,379
about it.

21
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:08,379
So, one has to realize that in Indian shastras,
scriptures, Shakti is the most important thing.

22
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:34,060
It is to be understood why: because, say now,
if you have a light or if you have fire, what

23
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:48,450
is the power of fire? The power of fire can
be that it can give you light, it can burn

24
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:55,810
away things, but supposing it does not have
its power, then who’ll care for fire? Nothing.

25
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:05,090
So anybody who hasn’t got the power of being
the Spirit, it is useless. So this power,

26
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:22,640
this Shakti, has to be awakened within us,
because we do not have the power of the Spirit.

27
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:32,610
We have to have the power of the Spirit. That’s
only possible if you get your Self Realization.

28
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:40,240
That is the reason it is very important that
we should pay attention to our power. Now

29
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,240
this power is made as the power of a Mother.
Mother is the most loving relationship, and

30
00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:00,220
through that relationship all the love is
expressed. That is why the Shakti is that

31
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:09,050
of a Mother, and the affection, the love,
the patience that Mother has for Her children,

32
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:20,200
the Shakti too has the same powers, you see,
and that is how this Shakti never can harm

33
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,800
you.

34
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Out of all these Shaktis, all these powers,
highest of all is what we call as the Kundalini,

35
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,160
because without Her you cannot get Realization.
But also we can say, higher than that, or

36
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:45,830
complementary to that, is Mahalakshmi power.
Without the Mahalakshmi you cannot rise. This

37
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:52,830
is the ladder through which this power of
Kundalini can rise. So both the powers are

38
00:06:53,020 --> 00:07:00,020
very important and very much related to each
other. Mahalakshmi principle starts when we

39
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,230
have finished with Lakshmi principle.

40
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:12,490
Like in the West, people are fed up with affluence,
fed up with all the riches and all that, so

41
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,140
they are thinking: “What have we achieved?
We have gone into imbalances, so what should

42
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:24,140
we do? We have to balance ourselves.” So
how do we balance ourselves? We have to have

43
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:30,500
the knowledge of the Spirit. That is called
as aadhyatma. You have to know what is the

44
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:37,500
knowledge of the Spirit, and to know the knowledge
of the Spirit Kundalini has to be awakened,

45
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:44,510
and that you are to be connected to this all-pervading
Power. Once that happens, you just become

46
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:57,170
one with that energy and you get transformation
within yourself, because there is light and

47
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,190
in the light you can see all your problems,
all your defects; and also if you know how

48
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:09,360
to correct it, is the easiest thing to do
is to get transformation in Sahaja Yoga. All

49
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,190
of you have been very much transformed, and
now I find it difficult even to recognize

50
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:20,850
you, because all your faces are changed, your
attitudes are changed, you look so different,

51
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,790
so beautiful.

52
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:29,790
Today it seems to be a special day for Me,
here in Mahalakshmi Temple, that Mahalakshmi

53
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:44,340
is being awakened, and I’m feeling really
in that state of thoughtless awareness. I

54
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:53,430
don’t know how I’m talking; and I am merged
just in the meditative mood, absolutely into

55
00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:01,180
meditative mood. Because when you are in the
center you don’t think, you are in meditation.

56
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:11,460
That is why Mahalakshmi is very important.
So when you are fed up, you can feel there’s

57
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:21,890
something missing, and then you take to Mahalakshmi
principle. But in India because of so many

58
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:28,890
saints, we feel that we should short-circuit
it. First let us develop our own aadhyatma,

59
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:38,570
let us develop our knowledge of atma and then
take to science, so there is no more imbalance

60
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:46,950
within us; because without the foundation
of aadhyatma, knowledge of the Spirit, you

61
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:55,160
take to any kind of progress, you can topple
down. That’s why all the Western entrepreneurs,

62
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:02,160
enterprises and also projections of religion
have gone to waste, because there has been

63
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,370
no balance. It is important that we must have
the balance within ourselves.

64
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:14,370
Now in India we have people who have this
idea, at least that you have to rise higher

65
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:27,260
than materialism and that you have to become
one with the Virata, part and parcel of the

66
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:37,500
whole. This they know, and that’s what,
by knowing that, once they get to Sahaja Yoga,

67
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:44,500
they grow very deeply; the depth, the depth
they have achieved with this faith, that we

68
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:52,550
have to be self-realized, and that we have
to feel the all-pervading Power. This conviction

69
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:01,360
itself gives them the depth and so when they
achieve Realization, they just go down very

70
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:08,050
deep. But most surprising, people who have
never heard about Ganesha, who have never

71
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:15,050
heard about Kolhapur, have never heard about
Mahalakshmi are sometimes much, much better,

72
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:22,240
much more deeper than the people who know
all these things by heart.

73
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:29,270
So one can deduct that those who know outwardly,
those who know through their books, or through

74
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:37,970
some gurus who teach them something, are absolutely
outside. They have nothing in them to tell

75
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:48,610
us because they have had no experience of
the Self, no experience of the Self. That’s

76
00:11:54,210 --> 00:12:01,210
only possible when your Kundalini rises and
breaks your Brahmarandra. That is the time

77
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:09,520
the first experience comes to you of this
all-pervading Power. So all those people who

78
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:17,460
have been only just praying to Mahalakshmi,
have been going to Her, doing a lot of penances,

79
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:26,860
fasting, this, that, have no idea as to what
Mahalakshmi wants, and they always complain

80
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,880
to Me: “Mother, we have done this, we have
done that.” People are very religious. They

81
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,380
are doing all kinds of ritualism, what we
call as karmakanda, but with that you do not

82
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:45,250
reach where you have to reach.

83
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:52,250
So one has to understand that whatever has
been written and told about all these great

84
00:12:53,150 --> 00:13:00,150
things in India, people may know in words,
but in experience they do not know. So Sahaja

85
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:09,480
Yoga is very important to give them this experience,
so that they can really verify whatever is

86
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,480
said in the science of spirituality about
getting Realization, is absolutely true. Not

87
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:27,089
only that but it’s very practical, and every
person who gets Realization can understand

88
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:32,040
it very well.

89
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:39,040
So we are here in a very holy place, full
of unholy people. But still there are some

90
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:48,330
very, very good people here also, and because
of Mahalakshmi, they make very good ornaments

91
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:59,460
because these ornaments are offered to the
Goddess. You can feel there a kind of a subdued

92
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:11,430
feeling for God, feeling for spirituality,
but they do not have the experience that you

93
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:19,000
have got, so you are much higher than all
of them. And those who have the experience

94
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,550
can feel more, once they go to the Temple,
if you can go to the Temple to see the place

95
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:30,990
also; but give yourself a big bandhan because
I have seen it, next to the deity there are

96
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:36,860
very funny people sitting. They’re doing
all kinds of commercial activities. They are

97
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,440
selling flowers, they are selling this, selling
everything. So you have to be careful, with

98
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,220
a bandhan you can go and see for yourself.

99
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:51,220
Now they say that this Temple is made because
it’s a swayambhu – it’s the one that

100
00:14:53,830 --> 00:15:00,830
has come out of Mother Earth – you can see
yourself if there are vibrations and moreover,

101
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,560
you must know that this puja of these deities
are done by people who are not at all in any

102
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:16,290
way religious, but are just commercial people.
Commercialism can never give you any satisfaction,

103
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:29,330
can never give you at all any satisfaction.
Apart from that it can take you to something

104
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:36,910
unknown, of dangerous shores. But if your
faith is pure, without any greed, without

105
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:51,850
any demands, then you develop your depth within
yourself; which is very helpful after Sahaja

106
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,390
Yoga.

107
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:05,390
It’s a remarkable thing how this Shri Chakra
is here and how they have made the complete

108
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:18,470
calculation of Shri Chakra. I met a scientist
in Russia, in Moscow, who has done a research,

109
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:29,910
very much big research on this Shri Chakra.
Now, so we have Shri Chakra on the right side,

110
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
on the left-hand side we have Lalita Chakra,
so all the things that we do with hands after

111
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:46,779
Realization are worked through, on the right-hand
side Shri Chakra, on the left-hand side Lalita

112
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:56,520
Chakra. Now how it works is a very complicated
thing, but we don’t have to worry about

113
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:04,339
that. As soon as you put your hand on somebody,
the chakra knows how to work it out. It works

114
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:12,039
by itself, as if it is a built-in mechanism
within us, which knows what sort of vibrations

115
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,600
to be given to a particular person for a particular
cause, or a particular purpose. If that person

116
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:30,449
has certain defects also, these chakras know
what is to be emitted, how to work it out.

117
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:38,309
So it is not that we have the Kundalini awakening
only, these chakras are awakened, we also

118
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:48,299
have these two chakras awakened within us
because of Kundalini. But if you have Vishuddi

119
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:56,019
problem, then you can find that your hands
are stiff and you cannot feel guidance, or

120
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:04,070
you can say, the Divine intentions of Realization;
because when you start using your hands you

121
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,489
don’t feel any vibrations, so how will you
know what’s happening? It’s a very complicated

122
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:21,489
thing, and for that complicated thing these
instruments are made already, are prepared

123
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:28,659
already; they are quite equipped with all
the knowledge that is necessary, like a feedback

124
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:35,429
as you call it, or we can call it a complete
programming is there. So as soon as you put

125
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:42,429
your hand on a person, the programming starts
working it out. Because it is programming

126
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:50,090
is done by God Almighty, it can never be wrong.
It cannot be two different things, as far

127
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:58,639
as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

128
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,679
I have been thinking about writing about all
these big, big peethas that are in India,

129
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:21,980
so it will be helpful to you as well as to
others in India. But here the atmosphere is

130
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:31,080
so bad, as if to think of God, to talk of
God is absolutely wrong, you cannot say. The

131
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:41,809
people are in illusion, and they think that
all these talks has brought us nothing. To

132
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:50,639
them it is the progress of the West is more
effective, more apparent, that they can see

133
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:05,200
how you have progressed in materialism, and
they can’t understand how we could progress

134
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:12,720
with aadhyatma very much in the area of physical
development or mental development.

135
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:25,450
So now we come to a point where we realize
that it is very important for all the Western

136
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:32,450
people to have the foundation of aadhyatma.
For that it is important to give up some of

137
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:45,950
your conditionings, because this knowledge
is coming definitely from India. I mean the

138
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,669
Indians had all the knowledge of your medical
science, this science, that science, that

139
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:58,669
science. But God’s science is in India,
and for that, what are you going to do? When

140
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:09,029
the question of God’s science is concerned,
what are you going to do about it? How are

141
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:15,960
you going to work it out, that this is the
science of God, and the God’s science has

142
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,960
to be understood with full dedication and
devotion?

143
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Because of the conditioning of the Western
influence, the Western progress, sometimes

144
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:41,009
we just do not know how to grasp this knowledge
within ourselves; very difficult. But if you

145
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:51,269
can understand that, as for science we had
to accept it fully from the West, you have

146
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:58,440
to accept the knowledge of your Spirit from
the East, East has the knowledge of the Spirit:

147
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:08,470
for that you have to be ready to receive it.
But if you are still in your arrogance, if

148
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,739
you are still in your own conditionings, then
you cannot do it. Like a boy who comes from

149
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:22,739
a village, who has never known about science,
and you suddenly put him in a science college,

150
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:30,039
he’ll say: “What is this nonsense, what’s
all this all? I have never known these things.

151
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:34,619
Why should I use a test tube, why should I
go in the laboratory?” All kinds of things

152
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:41,450
he can start saying, and this conditioning
is there. Then he’ll run away from school

153
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:48,450
within one year or two year, maybe earlier,
and that is what I find is their conditioning,

154
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:56,230
which turns away many people from Sahaja Yoga
after some time.

155
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:06,669
So we must watch our conditionings, what sort
of conditionings we have; while the Indians

156
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:13,489
have conditionings of so-called religious
beliefs and this ritualism, this, that, they

157
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:20,489
are very much conditioned also. But is easy
to overcome that when you realize that whatever

158
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:27,980
your worship: for example, in India everybody
has a kuladevata, means the family’s goddess,

159
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:35,749
everybody has; they must worship that goddess,
particular goddess, everybody has. So they

160
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:43,669
have to, if they just ask: “Mother, are
You that Goddess?” the vibrations start

161
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:50,859
flowing. So the conditioning gets very easily
eradicated, but the mental acceptance of something

162
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,789
is very difficult to go.

163
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:12,789
And I’ve seen also when they get married
or marriage is arranged, they go mental. They

164
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:20,470
go mental. If you go mental, then you cannot
understand many things. But if you are spiritual,

165
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:29,600
then you can understand. For example, we see
Mother Earth giving us these flowers and all

166
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,229
that, how can we go mental about it? It’s
a living process. For any living process we

167
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:40,359
cannot get mental. So now you will say: “All
right, this is because of seed has got this,

168
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:46,509
and the seed is planted”; but how, why?
That you can’t answer, can never answer.

169
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:52,529
Then you’ll keep quiet. But say if there’s
a sage, he’ll say: “All right, this is

170
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:59,529
Mother Earth, She wants to give to Her children,
these flowers, fruits, these trees, so She’s

171
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:09,190
working it out.” So one has to jump from
one conditioning of materialism.

172
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:19,179
Now you should see in matter, energy never
moves. Energy is stationary, it never moves.

173
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:30,149
And also energies which are moving, so-called,
like electricity, this, that, are absolutely

174
00:25:30,889 --> 00:25:36,720
blind. Supposing there is electricity here
flowing, all right, well and good, but supposing

175
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,720
somebody stops it, it will stop. It has no
mind, it is a mindless thing. So in materialism

176
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,659
you become mindless. You start seeing also
that within yourself, that you have become

177
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:57,659
mindless; and becoming absolutely, absolutely,
I should say, like robots sometimes, which

178
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:07,690
is mindless, which is fixed, fixed quantity.
And I see very much clearly, in the West I’ve

179
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:16,109
seen, that people have very fixed ideas. It’s
difficult for them to get out of it because

180
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:23,109
they don’t have that movement towards the
spiritual subtlety, where one can use the

181
00:26:28,979 --> 00:26:35,979
mind to do something. We would say that Mother
Earth has got the mind. Now that nobody can

182
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:43,119
believe in the West, except for Sahaja Yogis.
That the Mother Earth produces these vigrahas,

183
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:50,119
She produces these deities, nobody will believe.
How can you believe such a thing, that this

184
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:56,450
Mother Earth thinks, that this Mother Earth
produces these things? But logically you can

185
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,359
see, logically. Logically.

186
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:06,359
Say a tree has a certain height, the fruits
have a certain shape, certain colors, flowers

187
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:13,909
same: who changes all the seasons, specially
in India is very clear-cut six seasons? It’s

188
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:20,909
called as Ritambhara pragya in the Hatha Yoga.
Now that is the One which is a Lady, which

189
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:32,809
thinks. She has a mind of Her own, She decides
and She works out everything. This concept

190
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:44,759
was doubly denied in the West, is first is
that they cannot accept a Goddess. Woman has

191
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:53,659
no part. Right from Socrates onward, nobody
has talked much about a Woman, except of course

192
00:27:56,389 --> 00:28:03,289
there is Athena and all that, but it’s very
minor roles they have. Greeks had goddesses

193
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:10,289
who were just like human beings, so that also
gets ruled out, and very little was accepted;

194
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:16,169
and when Christianity came, somehow or other
Christians saw to it that there should be

195
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:22,899
no mention of the Mother in any way. But despite
that, people worshipped the Mother. They worshipped

196
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:29,899
the Mother of Christ as, some like a Goddess;
though in the Bible She’s talked as a “woman”,

197
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:37,179
in a very derogatory style She’s addressed.

198
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:44,479
So the conditioning of people is about the
power of God who hangs somewhere in the air,

199
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:54,269
that He’s there and that He gives us everything;
but what is the communication? What is the

200
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,349
justification or what is the logical thing,
how to explain? So you have to say: “It

201
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:08,479
is a mystery. God is a mystery. He hangs somewhere
in the air. He does everything.” And how

202
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:15,190
can people believe in it? So the Christian
conditioning has been even worse than, I think,

203
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:20,299
Jew conditioning because they just took it
out, Christ’s Mother, away; though the painters,

204
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:26,090
artists wouldn’t do that, they wouldn’t
accept: they had the Mother there. But despite

205
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:33,090
all that, the Motherhood has not been respected
that should have been, in the Bible, which

206
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:41,460
is a very wrong thing, while Mahalakshmi Herself
incarnated as Mother Mary Herself. And to

207
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:48,599
say about Mahalakshmi as “a woman”, I
think is a great insult. And where women are

208
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:55,599
insulted like this, where the Goddesses are
insulted, we cannot expect any spiritual growth

209
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:03,450
unless and until you accept that it’s the
Shakti, is the Motherhood, who is the only

210
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:11,929
thing that’s the communication between us
and the Divinity. So this conditioning, Christian

211
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:20,979
conditioning has to go out, as far as the
Motherhood is concerned. It’s very surprising

212
00:30:20,979 --> 00:30:27,979
sometimes when I see how these people have
tried to bring down the level of a Goddess

213
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:33,320
to just a woman.

214
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:40,320
So this is a very big blessing in India, that
they respect Mother as the Shakti, and that

215
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:47,440
the whole thing is done by the movement of
the Shakti, by the thinking of the Shakti,

216
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,529
by the coordination and the understanding
and the planning of the Shakti only. It’s

217
00:30:53,529 --> 00:31:00,529
not done by God Almighty, He’s just a spectator.
She does everything. Once that concept can

218
00:31:03,249 --> 00:31:10,249
fit into your heads properly, then you will
see so many conditionings will drop out; because

219
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:14,849
religion was organized, and in an organized
religion you can put whatever you like, the

220
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:21,849
way you want to put it, and it was such a
big mistake. By that people developed a lot

221
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:29,190
of ego, lot of things against women, and also
the first sin they call the “original sin”

222
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:40,279
and all that is because of a woman, they really
ill-treated women and they have no respect

223
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:42,679
for them.

224
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:48,759
So the women have changed their role, and
instead of becoming mothers and goddesses,

225
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:55,759
they have tried to become something like actresses.
But you can understand that without the power

226
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:06,419
there is no sense in anything, and this is
the power of Love and this is the power of

227
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:16,139
Truth. And once you get that power we should
humble down, and know that this power is within

228
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:26,009
us, which has given us all this knowledge,
which has given us all this ability to raise

229
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:33,099
the Kundalini. All this is because of energy
within us, the Shakti within us. Without that

230
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:40,099
we are nothing. And that too is the Mother
who has done it.

231
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:51,429
I do not know how much to press this point,
but it’s important; because I find, specially

232
00:32:55,669 --> 00:33:02,669
in England some newspaper people came: “How
do you feel as a guru, as a woman?” I mean,

233
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:11,200
it’s a kind of a thing, “a woman”, as
if I am sort of a, that movement where women

234
00:33:14,489 --> 00:33:19,409
are starting a fight with the men, sort of
a thing, and now: “This is another guru

235
00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:25,109
who is a woman, so She should be supported,”
or some sort of a nonsense like that. It’s

236
00:33:25,109 --> 00:33:32,109
the only the Mother who does this job, so
there’s no question of asking such a question.

237
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:40,169
But that’s what it is, that we should first
know that it’s the feminine quality of a

238
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:47,729
woman as a mother, is very powerful. But we
should encourage it and try to develop it,

239
00:33:53,700 --> 00:34:00,700
so that spiritually you can communicate, spiritually
you can imbibe these qualities for your own

240
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:11,700
children. The mothers who do not have aadhyatma
can never develop good children with proper

241
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:19,230
emotions, with proper value system of morality.
So it is very important for every mother to

242
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:36,700
be very proud that they are mothers, and for
girls who are going to be mothers to be very

243
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:43,039
proud that they are going to be mothers, and
that they represent the Shakti.

244
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:50,039
So now then, what is the part of the men is
to take full advantage of that power, by understanding

245
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:58,079
it, by complementing, by looking after that
power. I’m not talking only about your wives.

246
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:06,730
I’m talking about your sisters, your daughters,
your mothers, and the whole society, where

247
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:18,000
women are to be respected, and they have to
be respectable. And women should try to be

248
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,299
respectable, to try to know that they are
the powers and they are the ones who will

249
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:30,299
be used by this Divine power as channels,
more than men. But if they are useless, then

250
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:36,200
of course they wouldn’t bother about them,
they would like to bother then about men,

251
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:42,670
much more than what you are. So it is important
to understand what is your role in Sahaja

252
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:48,250
Yoga. This is your role in Sahaja Yoga. And
I am sure you can work it out. You can manage

253
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:55,250
this part. You can equip yourself for this
role, which is so beautiful and so good.

254
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:04,809
So much can be said about Mahalakshmi, and
there’s no end to it, but I think later

255
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:10,520
on we should keep this program on every year,
and you all should come to Mahalakshmi Temple

256
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:17,220
here, to the, I mean the Kolhapur, and then
I’ll again tell you all about the Mother’s

257
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,270
qualities, what She is as Mahalakshmi.

258
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:28,270
And today we’ll have the Shri Sukta. Shri
Sukta is about Mahalakshmi’s qualities.

259
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:45,819
I think we’ll have Ganesha Stuthi and then
we’ll have this. So seriously you must understand

260
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:49,619
what is it…

261
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:56,619
I’m just in meditative mood today, I don’t
know what I’m talking; because this Mahalakshmi

262
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:18,470
is a thing that goes, finishes everything
else. Left, right is finished now, you are

263
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:25,589
just in Mahalakshmi state: what to do? “Mahalakshmi
state” means nirvichar, nirvikalp, beyond

264
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:31,690
that, I don’t know what stages it is. It
comes down a little bit, then again it goes

265
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:38,279
back to 
the same.

266
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:45,279
