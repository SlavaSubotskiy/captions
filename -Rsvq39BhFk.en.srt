1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:09,820
Now this one is a praise of Mahalakshmi tattwa,
Mahalakshmi principle.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:22,620
And as you know that, Lakshmi principle is
the power of Shri Vishnu, which first establishes

3
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:42,410
within us when we start paying attention to
dharmic material life, dharmic financial life

4
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,990
and dharmic family life.

5
00:00:48,990 --> 00:01:03,990
After that seeking starts, seeking into higher
realms there.

6
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,510
It is manifested by the Mahalakshmi principle
within us.

7
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,170
That’s why in affluent countries people
start seeking.

8
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,560
They may go wrong, that’s different.

9
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:31,560
In a person this exists but the manifestation
starts when you are completely satisfied with

10
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,210
you material side, not with Sahaj Yoga.

11
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,340
In Sahaj Yoga it manifests and acts.

12
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:58,060
So the central path of Mahalakshmi starts
opening out, so rises above your nabhi chakra,

13
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,290
and goes up to your Sahastrara and pierces
through it.

14
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,950
In the Sahastrara also it is the Vishnu tattwa
that becomes the Viraata — it’s only one

15
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,950
principle.

16
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:27,290
It manifests itself in the Sahastrara and
you become aware of collective consciousness,

17
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,709
you become knowledgeable and you know the
truth.

18
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:36,040
It’s through the rising of the Kundalini.

19
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:46,390
Now here, they are only praising the middle
path, that’s the Mahalakshmi.

20
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:55,739
So here you are singing to me, to the Mahalakshmi
principle of mine.

21
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:08,150
But when it reaches the Sahastrara, in Sahastrara
it become the Mahamaya.

22
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:19,290
In the Sahastrara, it gets the power of the
Mahamaya, by which it has a thousand facets

23
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:31,330
and it puts you into illusions to test you
and to help you — in the Sahastrara.

24
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:37,290
But otherwise it has incarnated many a times.

25
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:47,959
Like we can say the Lakshmi has incarnated
on this Earth as Sita, as Radha, as Mary the

26
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,530
mother of Christ, and ultimately as your Mother.

27
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:59,269
But that’s only the central path and only
the one principle of Mahalakshmi.

28
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:03,120
So now here, you are praising me as Mahalakshmi.

29
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:13,150
So first they say “Oh Mahalakshmi, that’s
Mother, we praise you as Mahamaya — is the

30
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,021
One who creates this illusion of the world.

31
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:22,160
And you are the One who takes us out of this
illusion.

32
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:39,560
And you are the peetha, is the seat, or the
seat of the Shri Chakra.

33
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,660
And all the Gods worship you: “Shri peethe
sura pujite”.

34
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:50,220
“Shanka chakra gada haste” — because
it’s a Laksmi, you see, it’s the power

35
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,590
of Vishnu.

36
00:04:51,590 --> 00:05:01,740
He has shanka, that is the conch, the chakra
and the gada in the hand.

37
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,910
So, “Nirmala devi namostute, Mahalakshmi
namostute."

38
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,740
Now again Shri Vishnu is on the condor, the
Garuda.

39
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,820
So “Namaste garurha ruhe” — You are
the one who is going on the Garuda.

40
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,250
It’s so scientific.

41
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:26,800
She’s the power of Vishnu, of Narayana,
of Viraata, the central path.

42
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,200
How nicely, so She has all the weapons of
Shri Vishnu.

43
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,100
She rides on the Garuda.

44
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:46,300
“Kohlasura bayankari” — She’s the
one who killed Kohlasura.

45
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,480
Kohlasura is the one who was residing in Kohlapur.

46
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:59,930
She killed [him] there and there she appeared,
manifested in the temple.

47
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:07,100
That’s why in Kolhapur you have got Mahalakshmi’s
temple.

48
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:23,750
And “Sarvapapa hare Devi” — you are
the one who takes away all our sins, removes

49
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,910
all our sins.

50
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,910
“Mahalakshmi namostute”

51
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,300
“Sarvagye sarvavarade” — because Lakshmi
principle becomes Mahalakshmi, becomes then

52
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,570
the Viratangana, is the power of the Viraata,
is the same, [so] you know everything because

53
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,100
it is knowledge, it is the truth.

54
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,710
That’s the principle of truth, knowledge.

55
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:47,820
So, She is the one who knows everything: “Sarvagye
sarvavarade”

56
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:53,850
You are the one who gives all the blessings,
is the Mahalakshmi who gives you the blessings.

57
00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:05,550
“Sarvadushta bhayankari” — And you are
the one who is a terrible personality for

58
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:18,690
all those who are cruel — remember that!
— who are cruel people.

59
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:28,370
“Sarvadukha hare Devi” — You are the
One who takes away all the pains of the people.

60
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:36,610
Also the name of Shri Vishnu is Dhanvantari,
meaning the doctor; one of the names.

61
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:45,130
That means the Vishnu principle has got the
power to cure you, to give you relief from

62
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,790
pain.

63
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,660
Through that power You take away all our pain.

64
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,080
It’s true isn’t it.

65
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,110
“Sarvadukha hare Devi, Mahalakshmi namotute”

66
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:07,000
“Siddhi buddhi prade Devi” — You are
the One who is the giver of siddhis.

67
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,540
Now you have got siddhis, you can raise Kundalini,
you can cure people, you can know everything

68
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:18,130
on your central nervous system — are the
siddhis by which you know absolute knowledge.

69
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,900
You are the One who gives absolute knowledge.

70
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:27,480
Through the central path of Mahalakshmi you
get to know of the absolute knowledge.

71
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,580
So you are the giver of siddhis and buddhi.

72
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:39,039
You are the One who gives us the wisdom, buddhi,
is the intelligence, is the pure intelligence.

73
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,539
Pure intelligence comes from the central path.

74
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,690
You just see how they have described.

75
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:55,259
So you will be amazed that, if you sing the
song of, say, Shri Krishna or of Shri Rama,

76
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:02,689
or of Shri Vishnu or of Mahalakshmi, they
will have the same qualities described, because

77
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:06,160
they are one personality.

78
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,670
If you have their names, they will never intermingle.

79
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:18,269
Shiva will have His own qualities, Vishnu
will have his own qualities and Brahma will

80
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:22,410
have his own qualities — they are all separated.

81
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:39,999
So now here, what is the other quality is
that, in the middle, madhyankar, in the middle

82
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:50,149
of the ocean, in between the time, in the
interval part, You are the one who becomes

83
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:55,920
in the heart, the power of Shiva.

84
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
You know that.

85
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:07,379
See how clearly it is said, that, “In between
You become the power of Shiva and the One

86
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:18,139
who is the power of Maheshwara, is the Shiva."

87
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,410
Your the same middle path becomes.

88
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,889
“Yogade yoga sambhute” — You are the
One who makes it possible to get yoga.

89
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:30,829
You make us in such a way, ‘sambhute’
, ‘sambhut’ means you can make the situation

90
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:36,329
in such a way that we can get our Realisation,
yoga.

91
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:39,149
Not only that but you give Realisation.

92
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:56,730
Is the Mahalakshmi part of it.

93
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:03,779
You can become extremely subtle and extremely
gross.

94
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:10,790
So you can talk of very, very subtle things.

95
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:20,689
And you can move into human beings in a very
subtle manner and You can also, have a very

96
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:30,529
gross appearance, very gross behaviour, very
gross method, to handle the gross people.

97
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:34,629
I use that, you know that.

98
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:52,329
“Stula sukshma Maharaudre” — now You
are gross as well as very subtle and You are

99
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:55,939
the greatest destructive power ‘maharaudre’.

100
00:11:55,939 --> 00:12:03,179
‘Raudra’ is the power of Shiva, which
is destructive, but you are the one which

101
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:04,199
is the Maharaudre.

102
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:12,049
You have the power, the highest power of destruction,
the greatest power of destruction – maharaudre.

103
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:22,569
“Mahashakti mahodare” — You have a big
stomach and in that You contain all the powers,

104
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:25,699
the great powers, within Your stomach.

105
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:26,850
‘Maharaudre, mahodare”.

106
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:33,299
“Mahapapa hare Devi” — You are the one
who removes all our sins.

107
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,379
Papa is [sins].

108
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,949
And that is the One we worship.

109
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:41,019
“Padmasana stite Devi."

110
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:42,050
You sit in the lotus.

111
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,930
You are sitting in the lotus.

112
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:49,459
You will find Lakshmi always standing in the
lotus, but Mahalakshmi sits on the lotus.

113
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:54,009
You must have seen in the temple of Kolhapur
they have very, very big lotuses they give.

114
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:55,370
They grow there.

115
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,430
They do not grow anywhere else but there only
— such big, big lotuses.

116
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:04,329
Even in the Himalayas you won’t find them,
but at Mahalakshmi temple.

117
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:07,649
See how it’s all being done.

118
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:11,339
Whatever is described you get the proof of
it.

119
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:16,779
Now they describe, supposing, the flowers
that are liked say by Mahakali.

120
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:21,319
So if you go to [mount] Abu which is where
is the Ambas this thing [temple], you will

121
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:25,480
find the same flowers that are champakas and
all those are more there.

122
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:32,379
Then a kind of a fragrance that She likes
out of a glue called as gulgul.

123
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:35,089
They have described also about Her.

124
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:40,389
And that’s the place you find it, nowhere
else.

125
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:46,419
How the Mother Earth is also keeping those
limitations and those compartments meant for

126
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:49,149
different, different Goddesses.

127
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:56,839
So She sits on the lotus, sits.

128
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,620
She sits there and She establishes Herself
there.

129
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:09,779
Also it means that She sits on the lotuses
of your chakras and She establishes your lotuses.

130
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:18,249
So, throughout, in all the centres here, it
is the Mahalakshmi power, in different forms

131
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:21,869
and manifestations [that] works out the opening
of the chakras.

132
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:28,100
Even here where She becomes Madhyantar, in
the middle, in the little interval, [when]

133
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:33,319
She becomes, at that time, the power of Shiva,
it is Mahalakshmi.

134
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:35,680
So the principle is the same, of Mahalakshmi.

135
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,209
What is the principle of Mahalakshmi?

136
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,379
Is the ascent.

137
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:42,629
She helps the ascent of the Kundalini.

138
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:47,310
Because when the Kundalini rises there are
so many things to be done to keep the Kundalini

139
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:54,569
moving upward, not to make her fall down,
to open different chakras at different times,

140
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:59,920
and what you call the bandhas, are to keep
the central path in such a way that it [the

141
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,739
Kundalini] is pushed up and it is not allowed
to fall down.

142
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:08,449
All that is done through Mahalakshmi principle.

143
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:12,680
“Parabrahma swarupini” — She is the
One who is Parabrahma.

144
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,050
She is the One which is the All-pervading
Power.

145
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,389
Because of that we have the knowledge.

146
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:26,379
Because of that All-pervading Power of God
we get knowledge on our fingertips.

147
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:32,649
So it acts through your brain as Mahamaya,
through your nerves as boddhas, and all around

148
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:34,329
you you get the information.

149
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:43,949
So you become part and parcel of the whole
cosmos and you become a very efficient, already

150
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:47,389
programmed, computer.

151
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:54,250
She wears white dress.

152
00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:03,529
Whenever we have [public] programme I wear
white: “Shwetambara dhare Devi” — She

153
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,749
wears [white].

154
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:10,680
That’s the time I have to give Realisation,
so I am Mahalakshmi.

155
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,910
At the puja time I am Mahakali or Adi Shakti.

156
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:22,139
Mahakali is Adi Shakti…

157
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,059
(break in recording)

158
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:31,299
…Down to earth personality.

159
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:37,839
“Jagatstite” — down to earth (practical).

160
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,479
And She is the Mother of the whole universe,
of this world.

161
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,479
So Mahalakshmi.

162
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:56,329
Now, these two others [verses] are those who
read these stotras, these mantras about Nirmala

163
00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:15,880
Devi and do it with complete dedication, they
get all kinds of siddhis which are never lost.

164
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:28,730
They get the Kingdom of God forever.

165
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:36,150
The one who reads it once, it removes all
your sins.

166
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:49,380
Those who read it twice get into dhyana, into
samadhi state — only twice!

167
00:17:49,380 --> 00:18:00,950
If you read it three times, anyone who is
anti-God and troubling you gets destroyed.

168
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,080
Sahaja Yogi: We did it only twice Shri Mataji!

169
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:20,070
Shri Mataji: You have done it already twice
ah?

170
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,789
(laughter)

171
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:37,730
So, the one who becomes Nirmala Devi, means
who cleanses out, becomes an auspicious person,

172
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,590
becomes auspicious — shubha.

173
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:59,350
Because She’s the one, she gets prasanna,
over-pleased, She’s over-pleased and that’s

174
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:11,179
how She gives you blessings and you become
auspicious, because you are clean in heart,

175
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:20,950
there isn’t any ego, there isn’t any conditioning,
you have a very clean attention and clean

176
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,860
heart.

177
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:31,710
It’s the same now repeated, is the “Namastestu
Mahamaye, Shri peethe sura pujite.

178
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,889
Shanka chakra gada haste, Shri Nirmala Devi
Namostute."

179
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:48,730
It is a very, I should say, a precise, scientific
study.

180
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,970
Even when you take names.

181
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:57,159
I am amazed at these people, those who have
written.

182
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,120
I don’t know how.

183
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:08,320
Like the mantras in the puja.

184
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,440
What a description!

185
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:17,549
You start wondering what Divine eyes they
must have had.

186
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:27,149
I think at least your eyes should develop
to that state where you see those mantras.

187
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:33,000
We don’t have to create, but see that reflection,
if it is true or not.

188
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,450
It looks very fantastic but it’s a fact.

189
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,990
Some of the mantras really, it’s surprising
how they know!

190
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,850
I myself don’t know how they found it out!

191
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,309
(laughter).

192
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:53,429
But their discoveries show their depth, their
love, their dedication and understanding of

193
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:54,940
what I am.

194
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:05,169
Of course, at this stage I am a Mahamaya:
rather difficult, but still try.

195
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:20,460
Also intellectuals, the so-called intellectuals,
are the people, I think, who would walk backwards.

196
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,830
They can’t see the front.

197
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,659
If you walk backwards what do you see?

198
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:32,590
The reality is going out from you backwards.

199
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,451
It’s very difficult to talk to them.

200
00:21:34,451 --> 00:21:40,529
They always find something that is very surprisingly
funny to me.

201
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:44,860
But those who have the inner side [developed]
they see it so precisely, so clearly.

202
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,320
I mean, these were written long time back.

203
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,450
Of course, this one is written by Adi Shankaracharya.

204
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,210
But thousands of years back they have written
things.

205
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:59,559
Like Markandeya, he has described my knees,
can you imagine?

206
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:06,769
He must have crawled up to my knees to see
or what?

207
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:09,159
It’s exactly the same.

208
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:13,570
And here he says there are three folds, it’s
a fact.

209
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:20,539
All the time I have three folds, which human
beings don’t have: one on here, another

210
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,230
here, another here.

211
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,230
I have to have.

212
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:28,759
The eyebrows are described, everything.

213
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:31,639
It’s surprising.

214
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:39,539
They never saw me, I think, otherwise.

215
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:49,650
I didn’t exist before, as manifested, on
this Earth, but they saw me all right, especially

216
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,650
Markandeya.

217
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:58,150
When you go to this Vani, you have been to,
the temple of Saptashringi — Saptashringi

218
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,060
means ‘which has got seven peaks’.

219
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:14,090
It’s all right with me if I speak English
but [for] translation I am very bad.

220
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,789
So the shikaras are the seven chakras, and
that’s the Adi Shakti.

221
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:26,820
And the face is exactly like mine, with a
thousand hands.

222
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,690
And that is one temple [which] is not yet
spoiled.

223
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,470
But this Mahalakshmi temple is spoiled.

224
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,809
They get all the bhoots: not in front of Her
but at the back.

225
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:42,809
So we’ll have to remove that, and we’ll
manage.

226
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:49,620
It has nothing to do with a particular religion
or particular thing, it’s the inner understanding,

227
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,769
it’s the inner awakening — which is the
truth.

228
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:58,649
Now, one can say, “Why didn’t Christ say?”

229
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:01,290
He did in a way.

230
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,390
He did.

231
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:07,809
But just see where he was born, where there
was no tradition, no understanding.

232
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:11,070
He could not say all these things to us, could
he?

233
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:15,120
Even in India, how many people understand?

234
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,710
I asked so many people, “Why do you sing
this song in the temple of Mahalakshmi when

235
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,340
it is you are taking about Ambe?”

236
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,559
They didn’t know.

237
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,600
Nobody knows.

238
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:32,169
Even the ones who worshipped, have been there
in that temple, have been their forefathers

239
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:36,159
and forefathers and forefathers, they don’t
know.

240
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,309
They don’t know.

241
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:42,360
But at least they have the background.

242
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,669
But what’s the use of the background [of]
which you don’t understand anything?

243
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:58,850
Like a blind person, whether he stands next
to the flowers or to a donkey, God knows.

244
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,950
Now you are the ones who know.

245
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:12,160
But still, still we have to see for ourselves.

246
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
Many miracles, many things happen.

247
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,140
I hope you see the photographs.

248
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,200
Have they seen the photographs?

249
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,799
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji.

250
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,299
Shri Mataji: All of you have seen?

251
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:32,030
Have you seen the Deities?

252
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,120
Yogis: No.

253
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,760
Shri Mataji: No?

254
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:49,040
Oh God, where is it Gavin?

255
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,679
That’s very convincing!

256
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,080
Now, there are photographs that have come
out.

257
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:08,220
I am sitting like this and the cloth that
separates the brides and the bridegrooms is

258
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,240
just in.

259
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,020
You can see all the Deities sitting here,
around.

260
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,030
All of them!

261
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,499
Then all the bridegrooms are blessed with
light.

262
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:22,889
And you see all the arrows, which are described
now, that he sends arrows of love.

263
00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:29,190
Because they are getting married the Cupid
sends his arrows.

264
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:35,200
Then there are flowers which are Divine flowers,
for the brides.

265
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:46,570
And the one who is holding also that cloth
has got his Shri Chakra very clearly shown.

266
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:51,559
And all of you are sitting and on top you
is the light.

267
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:58,179
If you see it the other way round, it’s
my name written in Arabic!

268
00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:08,450
Also it looks like, a little bit, your cardiograph.

269
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,880
Everybody has light.

270
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,820
Everybody is a realised-soul.

271
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,650
It’s beautiful.

272
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:25,700
You must see that, and then you will know
your value, you will know your situation and

273
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,450
you will know what you are — you are all
realised-souls; not only realised-souls [but]

274
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,450
Sahaj Yogis!

275
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:38,749
You know all about chakras, you know how to
raise the Kundalini, you know how to give

276
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:39,749
Realisation.

277
00:27:39,749 --> 00:27:47,090
Such powerful people never lived on this Earth,
never existed, were never known.

278
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,650
You have entered into the Kingdom of God.

279
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:55,970
Not only that but you are on the stage and
everybody is looking after you.

280
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:01,400
You should see these photographs and you will
be convinced about it.

281
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:08,240
These were taken by an ordinary student, by
the small camera that you gave him as a present.

282
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,809
He brought and he said, “I can’t understand
what is all this English."

283
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,400
Poor fellow!

284
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,970
Trying to see this way that way.

285
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:27,290
You all should see it carefully, and then
we’ll enlarge and we’ll send it over to

286
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,290
people.

287
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,290
All the centres must have it.

288
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,499
Have you seen my photographs in the sky?

289
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:37,700
You’ve seen the photographs of the vibrations
on my house, Pratisthan.

290
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:45,879
But these are very remarkable photographs
I must say.

291
00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:51,779
They should convince you of your powers, of
you greatness, that you are very different,

292
00:28:51,779 --> 00:29:00,409
special people and you have to live like special
people, not to be bowed down by useless things

293
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:03,020
like, “My wife is like this!”

294
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,519
“My husband like this,” “My child like
this."

295
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:13,029
Who are your brothers and sisters?

296
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:22,690
Gyaneshwara has said, “They are all going
to be related."

297
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,769
“Soyeri ka hote."

298
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:28,220
“They will all be related.

299
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,659
Those who are in heaven.

300
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:31,659
They are the oceans.

301
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:43,399
Each one of them is the speaking ocean of
ambrosa.

302
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:53,010
And they are the great forests of boon giving
trees."

303
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,549
That’s you!

304
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:57,769
He describes you like that.

305
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:01,480
I mean, He never exaggerated.

306
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:14,769
He says, “Come along, you are the forests
of boon giving trees."

307
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:22,010
So let’s start one by one ahh?

308
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,169
Haa!

309
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:27,749
Also you see the angels.

310
00:30:27,749 --> 00:30:34,350
So first one with the Deities.

311
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:40,090
I am looking like a heart in the centre and
the rest of them are sitting behind me as

312
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,090
Deities.

313
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,090
You can all have it together, to see.

314
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:47,389
This is the first one.

315
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:52,520
All right.

316
00:30:52,520 --> 00:31:17,899
Now, here goes the second one where you find
the angels with their wings.

317
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:25,309
Pass it on.

318
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:35,030
Now, these are the arrows of love.

319
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:46,470
Pass it on.

320
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,289
(laughter).

321
00:31:50,289 --> 00:32:05,590
Now these are the blessings on the bridegrooms.

322
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:15,740
Now here I look like a white pitcher and here
are all the vibrations coming out from me.

323
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,869
The white one is me.

324
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:26,590
First see the Deities ones.

325
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,380
You see, one by one [the] series you must
see.

326
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,330
If you see it the other way round.

327
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,269
Now here are the brides blessed by Divine
flowers.

328
00:32:36,269 --> 00:33:05,899
This is the Shri Chakra of the person who
was holding that cloth.

329
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:25,909
This is my name written on top of your heads,
if you see the other way round you can see,

330
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:30,210
if you know Arabic.

331
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,279
Everyone.

332
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:39,739
I have always told you that the vibrations
are like half commas, like the moon of the

333
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:40,830
first day.

334
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:47,120
And you see me, a bundle of vibrations.

335
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,419
Yogi: It is [written] ‘Allah’, is God’s
name.

336
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:57,429
Shri Mataji: But if you put it like this,
it is my name.

337
00:33:57,429 --> 00:33:59,619
You see it is ‘Nir-mala’.

338
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:01,460
And ‘Allah’ otherwise, you see.

339
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:07,970
‘Allah’ if you see it from this side,
and from this side is ‘Nirmala’.

340
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,669
Yogi: Oh!!!

341
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:13,520
(applause).

342
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:22,770
Shri Mataji: ‘Allah’ is Viraata.

343
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:27,809
This is the one where Hanumana was sitting
before me.

344
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:37,309
I see all that but you don’t see, that’s
[what] the trouble is.

345
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:44,690
Yogis: (laughter)

346
00:34:44,690 --> 00:35:02,319
Shri Mataji: These are the two names [sides]
of one coin: one is ‘Nirmala’ the other

347
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:03,640
is ‘Allah’.

348
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:11,270
Also it is ‘Nirmala’ and ‘Sadashiva’.

349
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:20,090
Also it is ‘Nirmala’ and ‘Brahmadeva’.

350
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:30,210
So Allah is the same as Jehovah.

351
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:37,460
Pass it on to others to see.

352
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:44,230
We’ll have to make it big and we’ll get
them enlarged, isn’t it Gavin?

353
00:35:44,230 --> 00:36:23,069
This one is missing where the bullock carts
are.

354
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:41,630
So the muslims must have some sense in there
heads that’s why it is in Arabic.

355
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:51,609
They are the blindest people you can ever
think of, fanatics: this madman Khomeini.

356
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,109
He was dying, still he’s surviving.

357
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:54,620
He should not feel happy when he’s dying.

358
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,620
Let him die!

359
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:56,609
Can I have them (the photographs) back?

360
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:57,640
The ladies have seen?

361
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,750
All of you pass it that side first of all.

362
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,940
If somebody has not seen all of these?

363
00:38:01,940 --> 00:39:08,540
The last and not the least: this is for all
of you to understand that leadership is a

364
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,670
myth.

365
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:13,350
There’s nobody like a leader in the Kingdom
of God.

366
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:23,960
It’s not that a leader will be asked to
go first inside.

367
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,329
Nothing of the kind! (laughter)

368
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:31,089
But the worst are the leaders wives, they
start thinking themselves to be leaders.

369
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:33,530
They are the worst of all.

370
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,450
Don’t treat the wives of leaders as leaders.

371
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:47,710
And they have no business to guide anyone
or to tell anyone.

372
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,599
Be very careful on that point!

373
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,630
All such wives I don’t know where they’ll
end up.

374
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:59,609
It’s very common [that] those women who
have nothing in them try to bask in the glory

375
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:01,580
of their husbands.

376
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,289
You see so many prime ministers are like that,
their wives.

377
00:40:05,289 --> 00:40:17,170
So many of them we have had: Mrs Kennedy we
have had, Mao Tse Tung’s wife, we had the

378
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:26,820
wife of Chanta Sheik, of this Carlos also
of this…

379
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:30,960
Yogi: Mrs.

380
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,030
Marcos.

381
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:48,720
Shri Mataji: You see the wives of leaders
must keep themselves as non-identities.

382
00:40:48,720 --> 00:41:02,320
Any woman who tries such things will harm
the whole organisation.

383
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,900
Like people say Nancy Reagan rules her husband.

384
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,900
Imagine!

385
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,010
Shameful thing she does.

386
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:13,460
Ambav’s wife ruined him, that’s what they
say.

387
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:17,640
I mean everywhere they talk about this kind
of a thing.

388
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,250
So no leader’s wife is to be treated like
a leader by any chance!

389
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,109
Not to be given any importance.

390
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:29,600
And they are to be put down in their own places.

391
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,910
First of all they think they work very hard.

392
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,410
God knows what work they do!

393
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,890
They think no end of themselves.

394
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,520
They have to work very hard like all others.

395
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,650
They are like all other women, they are not
to have any special position.

396
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,790
That’s the sign of a real Sahaj Yogini.

397
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:58,340
You’ll be amazed, though I am Adi Shakti,
I never go into my husband’s office; never,

398
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:02,950
never telephone to him, never use anyone from
his office.

399
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:10,660
Nor do I to any one of his people, whatever
may be the difficulty, whether I have Sahaja

400
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,490
Yoga or not.

401
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:17,360
And this I have done all my life.

402
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:22,080
I never preach Sahaja Yoga in any one of his
offices.

403
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,180
Anybody from his offices I said, “Keep out!

404
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:31,750
You are not allowed in Sahaja Yoga till my
husband is working with you."

405
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:38,630
And if I telephone to him he thinks I must
have met with an accident!

406
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:42,120
He gets so upset.

407
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:51,150
But to bask in the glory of a father or husband
is a sign of a woman who doesn’t have any

408
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,980
personality: she must be a useless woman,
absolutely.

409
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,140
Show no special respect for such women!

410
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:04,940
They must stand in their own dignity like
all other Sahaj Yoginis are.

411
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:12,339
They have no business to take any decision
as wives of the leaders.

412
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:17,859
They have to be humble, intelligent.

413
00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:21,760
They have to work hard.

414
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,740
I have to do a lot of work for my husband:
I cook for his friends, I clean his ships.

415
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:31,589
Such a lot of things I have done for him.

416
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:34,059
I have decorated his ships.

417
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:36,619
Whatever type of work he has done.

418
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:40,700
I have to feed his clerks and his chaprasis
(junior office worker), his peons.

419
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,900
Everything I have done, lots of things.

420
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,299
But never, never once I asked [for anything].

421
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:51,970
I have to bring presents for his secretaries
and other people.

422
00:43:51,970 --> 00:44:01,289
I think before Christmas I have to give presents
to all of them but never, never asked the

423
00:44:01,289 --> 00:44:13,450
driver even to bring the car or even to bring
the medicine or even to bring the letter which

424
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,110
has arrived.

425
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,849
That should be the attitude, that’s a sign
of your dignity.

426
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:22,440
You are not here because you are somebody’s
wife!

427
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,640
You are here because you are a Sahaja Yogi
and a Sahaja Yogini.

428
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,160
All these complications come because your
attention is more on the husband or the wife

429
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:39,940
and not on me, and you don’t love me enough.

430
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,930
If you love me you will know me very well.

431
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:46,690
Like the people who have known me, they only
loved me.

432
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:52,140
And I don’t gain anything out of your love,
you have to gain something by loving me.

433
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:57,670
This is the last message I give you.

434
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:05,010
Horrible things I have seen happening to leaders
— and to different ashrams and different

435
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:11,710
cities and different countries — because
the wife is a negative woman.

436
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:15,880
And negativity always goes through the wives.

437
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:22,230
Always you will find politicians attacked
through their children, through their wives,

438
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:24,630
through somebody else.

439
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:29,910
And the leaders must put them down in their
own places.

440
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:40,650
You must have seen when my daughter came and
I asked her to come on the stage, she would

441
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,690
not.

442
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:52,109
I had to tell her, “At least come in front!”

443
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:55,240
She would not.

444
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:01,369
Always the wives are more susceptible, vulnerable
to negativity, so they have to be extremely

445
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:03,099
careful.

446
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:07,380
They should not take any decisions.

447
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:15,609
I have seen if they are miserly wives, horrid
they are, horrid.

448
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:21,210
The leaders are there because of their own
position, not because of their wives by any

449
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,210
chance.

450
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:26,700
In this I am muslim I think.

451
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:31,930
If it’s a lady who is the leader, she should
not look at her husbands face all the time,

452
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:34,240
what he has to say.

453
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:45,049
She should behave like a leader and should
not praise her husband beyond a certain point:

454
00:46:45,049 --> 00:46:50,902
he doesn’t matter in Sahaj Yoga.

455
00:46:50,902 --> 00:46:51,902
All right?

456
00:46:51,902 --> 00:46:52,902
I hope you understand.

457
00:46:52,902 --> 00:46:59,480
The women are the power behind the man and
they are not the manifestation of the power

458
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,920
of their husbands.

459
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,700
They have to give power to their husbands
and not to use his powers for their own use.

460
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:17,130
It’s a sign of a person who is very low
level and has no self-respect.

461
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:23,849
There are many subtle ways by [which] they
assert themselves, so be very careful, very,

462
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:25,930
very careful.

463
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:32,740
All the Sahaj Yogis must also remember that
your husbands or wives should not guide you

464
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,450
in Sahaj Yog.

465
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:42,660
Another point is that, in the name of ‘love’
you go on hugging each other: please don’t

466
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,660
do it!

467
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,140
The Kundalini gets affected.

468
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,589
Kissing each other.

469
00:47:46,589 --> 00:47:50,740
It’s all right men can hug men, women can
hug women.

470
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,190
But not too much of it [is] also not so good.

471
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:57,180
Maybe a bhoot does that more because she wants
to pass on bhoots into your body.

472
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,180
Better to keep out.

473
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,890
But the kissing business must be stopped immediately.

474
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:05,910
I mean, this French style of kissing everybody
is horrid!

475
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,190
You get a shock you know.

476
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:17,890
Any time you meet a French man you don’t
know where he is going to kiss you.

477
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:23,380
These are our private things, whom to kiss,
whom not to kiss.

478
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:29,309
How can we be exposed to every person like
that?

479
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:33,849
Even children should not be kissed much, and
if you have to kiss, kiss on their hands and

480
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:34,849
on their heads.

481
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:46,020
Then in the name of affection, love and compassion
we go to bhoots.

482
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:53,440
Now if somebody is sick, say, with AIDS you
have nothing to do with that person.

483
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,109
Anybody who is sick you don’t have to do
anything with that sick person: give my photograph,

484
00:48:57,109 --> 00:48:58,109
I’ll look after.

485
00:48:58,109 --> 00:49:05,040
You don’t have to go and cure anybody who
is sick because you have compassion.

486
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:12,510
You don’t have more compassion than I have
and I don’t believe in small families of

487
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:16,940
husband, wife and one and a half child.

488
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:23,140
I believe and you should also believe, which
is the truth, in the largest family, the big

489
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:29,330
family, where we are all part and parcel,
children of one Mother.

490
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:36,770
So don’t waste your attention on your family
business — you’ll never grow.

491
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:41,230
First you didn’t believe in family, you
didn’t believe in your children.

492
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:45,420
Now you believe too much in your family, too
much in your children.

493
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:51,360
It’s just the same, what difference does
it make?

494
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,900
Whether you are in the pitcher or in the river,
it’s just the same: you are in the water

495
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,190
isn’t it.

496
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:07,640
So we don’t believe in this kind of a small
family affairs, “My wife, my son, my this."

497
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:15,789
These limitations must be broken and you must
think yourself to be a Sahaj Yogi first and

498
00:50:15,789 --> 00:50:17,420
last.

499
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,880
Of course by the way you have a husband, by
the way you have a wife, by the way you have

500
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:27,589
children, but they shouldn’t form a major
part of your life.

501
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:33,480
Your Spirit is the major part and the only
part that you have.

502
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,880
The rest of it is just by the way.

503
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:45,680
If they are realised-souls, if they are Sahaj
Yogis [then] all right, they are with you.

504
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:52,130
Now, the last of the last, [is] that when
girls come from India you don’t think they

505
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,460
are all goddesses.

506
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,500
Don’t pamper them!

507
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:01,380
Don’t tell them that they are great: “You
look very beautiful."

508
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:06,380
You see, one girl came to Italy and all the
people said, “You are a classical beauty."

509
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,700
Can you imagine?

510
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,190
And this ‘classical beauty’ could not
get married for thirty-eight years!

511
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:14,070
And she really believed it [that] she was
a ‘classical beauty’.

512
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:17,329
I don’t know what she thought of herself.

513
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:21,770
And ultimately she became mad, she made her
husband mad.

514
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,609
So don’t treat them like goddesses.

515
00:51:23,609 --> 00:51:25,040
They are Indians, so what?

516
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,740
They are just like you — nothing so special!

517
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:34,049
But when they come here you try to pamper
them, give them presents, look after them.

518
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:40,490
Then they become naughty, they become rude
and then you become unhappy.

519
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,599
Treat them just like any other woman.

520
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:49,000
Especially women they lose their heads very
fast.

521
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,660
In India they are not treated like that once
they are married.

522
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:55,600
And big, big problems you have caused me.

523
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:01,000
There’s one lady who came to France: you
made such an ado out of her, now I don’t

524
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,059
know what to do with her.

525
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:05,290
The husband doesn’t want her, the father
can’t look after her.

526
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:08,390
Another one came to Switzerland, another horrid
one.

527
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:13,130
And they know how to handle you now and they
know how to frighten you.

528
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,160
Keep them down!

529
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:21,710
I’m allowing you even to give them two slaps
if they misbehave.

530
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:24,810
Because they come from India they don’t
become something great.

531
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:26,539
They are human beings, you are human beings.

532
00:52:26,539 --> 00:52:29,390
They are Sahaj Yogis, you are Sahaj Yogis.

533
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:31,630
Don’t spoil their heads.

534
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:34,070
Don’t give them special treatment.

535
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:38,039
They are just like all other Sahaj Yogis.

536
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:45,670
It’s very surprising: it has caused me so
much of trouble.

537
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:51,549
Some of them are quite negative, left-sided.

538
00:52:51,549 --> 00:52:56,589
Be careful!

539
00:52:56,589 --> 00:53:01,630
Very left-sided.

540
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:04,230
And some of them are very right-sided too.

541
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:11,789
So it’s not proper also [because] then we
have to leave them alone and then it’s a

542
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:19,960
bad name for us in Sahaj Yoga.

543
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:30,930
Treat them just like ordinary people and immediately
they start showing off you let me know.

544
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:31,930
This is very important.

545
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,280
There are some very sensible women from India.

546
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,500
I would say Chaya is one, who had come here,
Regis’s wife.

547
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,260
She is very, very sensible.

548
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:47,339
Yes, we have some very sensible, very, very
matured women, but also stupid [ones].

549
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,190
Some of them have no background.

550
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,609
They come from very poor families sometimes.

551
00:53:51,609 --> 00:53:55,510
Sometimes they come from families where they
have suffered a lot and suddenly their heads

552
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:58,079
go off, so be careful.

553
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,230
Some of them are from rich families so their
heads are off!

554
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:05,099
Keep them into balance.

555
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:07,750
I think you have some problem there?
