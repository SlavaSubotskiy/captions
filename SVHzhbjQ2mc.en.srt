1
00:05:11,714 --> 00:05:22,788
Today we have such a great opportunity
to celebrate the birth of Christ.

2
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:34,724
He was born in a manger.

3
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:40,475
All these things are already pre-planned.

4
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:51,503
That He should be born in a manger
in difficult situations,

5
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:56,911
to show that whether you are born
poor or rich,

6
00:05:57,112 --> 00:06:04,285
whether you are born in difficulties
or in problems,

7
00:06:04,486 --> 00:06:09,927
if you have Divinity within you it shines
by itself.

8
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:25,977
As the Christianity took a very wrong
deviated line,

9
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:33,198
they have never been able to understand
the significance of Christ.

10
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:43,373
To them Immaculate Conception is absolutely
not possible.

11
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:48,977
Most of the people think that it's some
sort of a mythical story.

12
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:55,189
But in India we do believe

13
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:10,269
that Gauri created Shri Ganesha out
of Her own vibrations

14
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:16,274
and that He became the Deity of Mooladhara.

15
00:07:16,475 --> 00:07:21,125
We accept it. But not in the West.

16
00:07:21,326 --> 00:07:23,289
They will never accept such a thing

17
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:30,649
because their mental side is over-developed
and dominates them.

18
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:39,067
Maybe they are not so very old like Indians

19
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:43,948
to understand that above all is God.

20
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:48,865
Even the concept of God is quite mental.

21
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:53,758
Moreover, the way Christianity has been,

22
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:59,941
it has not provided any proper guidance.

23
00:08:00,142 --> 00:08:06,154
On the contrary, whenever they have failed
they said: "It's a mystery."

24
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:12,779
But it's very simple to understand
for Indians,

25
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,549
that anything is possible for God.

26
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,663
After all He is God. He is God Almighty.

27
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:29,582
Because of this mental attitude which
is much lower

28
00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:34,394
than the knowledge of your Spirit,

29
00:08:34,595 --> 00:08:38,901
the ordinary, mundane type of this
superficial knowledge

30
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:48,247
can never allow the personality to accept
the greatness of God.

31
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:54,846
I had a grandma. She was My father's aunt

32
00:08:55,047 --> 00:09:02,755
and she used to tell us a nice story about
somebody who was going to meet God.

33
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:06,390
Of course this - in India everybody
understands all these things.

34
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:09,591
They will not say: "How is he going to meet
God?" but they accept, you see:

35
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,172
“All right, he is going to meet God”.

36
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:16,385
So when he was going on the way,
on the road, he found one gentleman

37
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:22,671
sitting there, nicely singing songs,
bhajans of God,

38
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:26,525
doing nothing on the roadside.

39
00:09:26,726 --> 00:09:29,637
So he said: "Oh, so you are going
to meet God?"

40
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:34,796
"Yes, I am going to meet Him. So have
you any message for Him?"

41
00:09:34,997 --> 00:09:38,767
"Yes, please tell Him that I'm all right,

42
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:45,476
but He should arrange for my food, because
I think the food is now finishing."

43
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:49,173
He said: "Really, that's what you want
me to tell Him?"

44
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:57,566
"Yes, yes, please tell Him. Oh, of course
He'll arrange, but please tell Him."

45
00:09:57,767 --> 00:10:01,466
So he went ahead and he met another
gentleman

46
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,757
who was standing on his head, or
in a Christian way I would say

47
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,742
he was going to church every day with nice
suits, and singing hymns every day,

48
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,087
listening to the pastor's sermons, or
whatever you may say;

49
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:16,860
and in the Indian way we can say he was
going to the temple every day,

50
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:21,742
standing on his head, doing all kinds
of yoga asanas and everything.

51
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:26,779
And he asked him: "Please go and ask
God - I've tried everything.

52
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,489
When is He going to meet me? I would
like to see Him.

53
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,286
I would like to have His darshan."
He said: "All right."

54
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:38,099
So he went to God,

55
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,637
and whatever work he had he finished
with it,

56
00:10:43,838 --> 00:10:48,541
and then God asked him: "Have you got
anything to tell Me?"

57
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:55,713
He said: "Nothing much, but I met one
gentleman while coming

58
00:10:55,914 --> 00:10:59,749
and he said that 'I'm doing all kinds
of things, I have tried everything,

59
00:10:59,964 --> 00:11:02,672
and when will God meet me? I am standing
on my head,

60
00:11:02,873 --> 00:11:07,057
and I am doing also all kinds of yoga
asanas, and all kinds of things,

61
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:10,596
and also I am going to church and
mosque, I am praying,

62
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:16,517
doing all sorts of prayers, but when will
God meet me?'"

63
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:20,492
So God said: "Tell him he has to do little
more.

64
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:25,717
See, it's not easy. When Sahaja Yoga
will come we'll see!"

65
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:40,924
So then even he said: "And there’s another
one who was on the road, You see.

66
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,122
He was just enjoying himself singing songs,

67
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:46,270
he suddenly saw me, and he told me:

68
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,448
'You see, my food is now finishing, ask
God to arrange it for me.'"

69
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:53,662
He said: "Really, is the food just
finishing?" Immediately God said:

70
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:57,209
"What are you doing, why don't you go
and look after him? His food is finishing."

71
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,528
"No, no, Sir, we yesterday only, we
arranged it, all that."

72
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:03,808
He said: "All right, all right, doesn't
matter." You see, he couldn't understand,

73
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:06,005
you know, that this fellow who is trying
all these things

74
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:09,222
and God is still saying that he has
to wait.

75
00:12:09,423 --> 00:12:12,879
And while this fellow is just singing songs
of God and all that,

76
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,194
and why is it so much impressed by this
another fellow

77
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:22,632
who is doing nothing to seek God?

78
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:26,074
So then God realized that he is in some
sort of an illusion.

79
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:30,973
So He told him: "All right, you go and tell
them one thing.

80
00:12:31,174 --> 00:12:36,655
To both of them the same thing, that 'When
I went to God what I saw there

81
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:45,123
was that He made a camel pass through
the eye of a needle.'"

82
00:12:46,823 --> 00:12:50,009
So he said: "Really, I should tell them?"

83
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,292
"Yes, yes, you just tell them, and see
the reaction."

84
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:57,662
So he went down. So this is, the first one
met him, he said: "What God has said?"

85
00:12:57,863 --> 00:13:01,570
He said that God has said: "Wait till
Sahaja Yoga comes in, then I'll meet you.

86
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:04,192
Before that you go round like this."

87
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:06,442
"Oh God, when will this Sahaja Yoga come?"

88
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:09,036
And he said: "So, but He'll meet me
sometime?

89
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:13,859
I hope Sahaja Yoga also comes some time."

90
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,809
And he was quite disappointed.

91
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,541
So he went and he asked him that:
"What did you see with,

92
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:25,099
there when you went to see God?"
He said: "I saw that, you know,

93
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,299
He passed a camel through the eye
of an, of a needle."

94
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:33,334
He said: "What? How is it possible?
It's impossible!" -

95
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:36,285
Now mental - "How is it possible,

96
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:39,451
that a camel can pass through the eye,
it's not possible,

97
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:44,906
see the volume of this one and such
a little thing. How can he pass?

98
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:47,906
No, no, no, no you are just telling me
a story because you have been to God,

99
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:52,134
you are trying to show off, that's all. I,
I don't believe in all this nonsense.

100
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:55,831
You see, you are just telling me lies,
and don't try to befool me."

101
00:13:56,032 --> 00:14:00,645
So he went to another person who was
on the street eating nicely.

102
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:03,629
He said: "How are you?" "Oh, I know He had
arranged before you reached there,

103
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,025
I know it was all right after all. You see,
He looks after me all the time.

104
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:13,729
So what did you see when you went there?"
He said: "I saw that God Almighty

105
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:20,717
passed a camel through an eye of a
needle. It's a very amazing thing."

106
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:26,123
He said: "What amazing thing? He is God,
do you know He is God?

107
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:33,208
Do you know He is God? God can do
anything. He can do anything!"

108
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:41,768
That's made him understand, that if you
understand that God is all-powerful -

109
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:46,162
all-powerful, it doesn't mean that He can
move Himalayas to Maharashtra.

110
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:49,480
It doesn't mean that!

111
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,482
But it means He is all powerful.

112
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:06,583
Means He can do subtlest and subtlest
thing, and such things

113
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:11,946
which our brain, this mental side cannot
understand.

114
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:18,034
It's beyond the conception of a human mind.

115
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:23,420
This is what God is.

116
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:26,266
He is the One who has created human beings.

117
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,490
He has to be beyond us if He is creating.

118
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:31,946
If a potter creates a pot that means
he is beyond the pot.

119
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:35,677
Pot cannot create God... the potter.

120
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:41,373
And the potter has created the pot,
so that means that this pot

121
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:46,513
which is created by him has to be -
something which is made by him,

122
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:52,077
so he has to be much more powerful
than the pot is.

123
00:15:53,570 --> 00:16:01,197
But it is unbelievable, or say, beyond
the conception of human beings,

124
00:16:01,398 --> 00:16:11,144
that what a God it must be Who has made
this great computer.

125
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:15,715
We take everything for granted.

126
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:21,830
We cannot even make a particle of clay
ourself.

127
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:25,550
We cannot make anything, human beings
cannot make.

128
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,774
Ha, if there is some stone, all right, you
can put this up.

129
00:16:28,975 --> 00:16:33,748
If there is some clay, you can make some
sort of a house out of it.

130
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:37,339
But it’s all dead from the dead.

131
00:16:40,156 --> 00:16:51,632
But can you make a candle which will
burn badhas?

132
00:16:55,858 --> 00:17:03,102
You have seen it with your own eyes that
before My photograph the badhas burn.

133
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:06,369
Can you do that?

134
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:15,522
Now you, we have no, also the idea
of the complete, intricate working,

135
00:17:15,723 --> 00:17:27,015
delicate machinery, and also very dynamic
explosive machinery,

136
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:32,690
how it works to create human beings,
to create all this universe,

137
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:40,022
to create all these beautiful flowers and
trees and everything.

138
00:17:40,223 --> 00:17:44,991
Look at the stars. Look at how many
they are.

139
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:50,169
Out of that He has chosen this Mother Earth
to create human beings.

140
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,785
How He has made it?

141
00:17:55,947 --> 00:18:04,956
When He wants to send His own Son, He
can send it the way He wants to send it.

142
00:18:06,526 --> 00:18:18,591
Even to challenge this shows the mental
mind which is in, absolutely in mud.

143
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:27,383
So to accept it is only possible

144
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:31,541
when you have saints, real saints who
tell you,

145
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:38,237
that this is how Shri Ganesha was born
out of Gauri.

146
00:18:42,526 --> 00:18:46,737
But to jump into it, into faith,

147
00:18:46,938 --> 00:18:53,061
when you come to Sahaja Yoga, you start
seeing miracles taking place.

148
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:58,439
Then you can understand that these miracles
are taking place

149
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,724
and if there is another miracle that has to
take place it will take place in any case.

150
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:09,397
 We are not doing anything, it’s all done.

151
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:16,567
And we don't doubt it. Once you doubt
you become again the same

152
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:24,056
human being which is just embedded
in the mud.

153
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,329
I always say that you are like lotuses now
opened out.

154
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,234
You are not flying in the air. Your roots
are down there.

155
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:39,745
But you are now lotuses,

156
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:47,156
and that's what is on top of the lotus,
this Mahalakshmi principle is born.

157
00:19:47,357 --> 00:19:53,863
Mahalakshmi principle is the One which
came on this earth

158
00:19:54,064 --> 00:20:05,162
as Sitaji, as Radha and also as Mary,
as Mother Mary.

159
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,317
It's said that Mahalakshmi is born out
of the sea.

160
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:18,289
What is the meaning of "Mary"? Maria means,
you know, Marine means "the sea".

161
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:22,738
She was born out of the sea.

162
00:20:22,939 --> 00:20:29,602
So She being a Mahalakshmi Herself, She
could create a child. What's the harm?

163
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:35,596
She could do anything,

164
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:41,511
and this is the thing you have to rise
above.

165
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:45,648
Christians have to rise above this
Christianity,

166
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:49,842
and has to understand that it's such
a great thing that was Christ

167
00:20:50,043 --> 00:20:56,560
Who came on this earth, Who was the
Incarnation of the principle of Ganesha.

168
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:59,685
Ganesha becoming Mahavishnu is
a very big thing

169
00:20:59,886 --> 00:21:02,962
which one should try to understand.

170
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:10,039
Ganesha is the Son of Shiva.

171
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:22,869
Shri Ganesha is the One Who was first
created before creating anything,

172
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:30,930
any atmosphere, anything, because He is
the Omkara,

173
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:37,163
and the Omkara is the first breaking
of Adi Shakti from Shiva.

174
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:42,272
That sound, "Tan-kar", as they call it.
From there started Omkara

175
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:47,525
and He is the One Who is the embodiment
of that Omkara.

176
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:51,558
So this sound is Shri Ganesh, is His power,

177
00:21:51,759 --> 00:22:00,063
was created first foremost thing, just
to create holiness, pavitrata.

178
00:22:00,264 --> 00:22:04,509
When this holiness was created, this
pavitrata was created,

179
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:11,573
then everything was created in the sea
of that holiness.

180
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:20,892
And then He incarnated as Christ, but
as Mahavishnu,

181
00:22:21,093 --> 00:22:26,591
not as Shiva's Son, but as Mahavishnu.

182
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:34,511
And who is Vishnu? He is an uncle
of Shri Ganesh.

183
00:22:35,336 --> 00:22:42,471
His Mother's brother is Shri Vishnu.

184
00:22:43,606 --> 00:22:49,366
So the, it was brought up, we should say,
by Mahavishnu, we can say,

185
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:56,213
but Mahalakshmi adopted the principle
of Shri Ganesh.

186
00:22:56,414 --> 00:22:59,514
In the Kundalini chart you can see that
the Shri Ganesha

187
00:22:59,715 --> 00:23:04,620
is connected on the left-hand side
to the Ida Nadi,

188
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:12,068
and the Kundalini is above that.

189
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:19,333
So now what has happened is this, that
He transcended that part,

190
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:22,234
and if He had to come for the redemption,

191
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:27,501
He had to come as the Son of Mahalakshmi.

192
00:23:27,702 --> 00:23:31,086
So it was Mahalakshmi who adopted Him,

193
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:38,953
or we should say, really conceived Him
within Himself as Christ,

194
00:23:42,226 --> 00:23:44,765
and He became Mahavishnu.

195
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:53,484
Anything is possible in the family of Gods
and Goddesses, because they are Gods.

196
00:23:55,497 --> 00:24:01,033
It is beyond human mind to understand
how these things

197
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:07,867
are working out in that realm. Very
difficult.

198
00:24:08,422 --> 00:24:12,110
But now you have got Realization, you can
feel in the cool breeze,

199
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:16,683
so many new things are happening to you.
So now believe Me,

200
00:24:16,884 --> 00:24:21,856
that there is no unholy alliances

201
00:24:22,057 --> 00:24:25,002
among the Gods and Goddesses, no
unholy alliances.

202
00:24:25,203 --> 00:24:29,963
There is nothing that is human in them.

203
00:24:30,164 --> 00:24:36,421
They are all divine, pure people.

204
00:24:38,532 --> 00:24:41,839
Once you understand this point, then
you will understand

205
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:52,178
why Shri Ganesha had to accept to be
a Son of Mahalakshmi,

206
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:56,718
was born to Him as Christ.

207
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:04,478
Because He had to come on Agnya,
and for the redemption,

208
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:10,256
as Ganesha, He doesn't do the redemption
part,

209
00:25:10,457 --> 00:25:18,721
because at that stage He is for
the innocence, for the holiness,

210
00:25:18,922 --> 00:25:26,060
for the wisdom or also for destroying
a negativity.

211
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:32,042
But He had to come up; only He,

212
00:25:32,243 --> 00:25:42,429
only Ganesha could be brought to this
very constricted chakra, Agnya chakra.

213
00:25:43,318 --> 00:25:46,366
Now why is it constricted? It's quite
a scientific thing

214
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:49,218
which I would not like to discuss today.

215
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:51,891
But it had to be constricted

216
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,419
and it goes on getting more constricted,
this Agnya chakra,

217
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:02,935
the more, the more we think, the more
we go into the left or right,

218
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:07,685
it goes on really becoming like this,
absolutely like this.

219
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:15,763
So in this very subtle area only Christ
could be settled,

220
00:26:15,964 --> 00:26:20,102
because He is the subtlest of subtle.

221
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:26,671
He's even subtler than an atom, because
in the atom

222
00:26:26,872 --> 00:26:31,454
those vibrations which move asymmetric
and symmetric movements

223
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:36,538
are subtler than the atom.

224
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:39,955
And this is the subtler of that also.

225
00:26:40,156 --> 00:26:45,206
So in that little very constricted area,

226
00:26:45,407 --> 00:26:55,026
only a personality like Christ, which is
nothing but purity.

227
00:26:55,227 --> 00:27:07,700
There is no other element in Him
but purity.

228
00:27:08,248 --> 00:27:16,918
All other Incarnations have all the five
elements in it.

229
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:23,716
He has nothing. He is nothing but pure
vibrations.

230
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:27,642
That's why He could walk on the water,

231
00:27:27,843 --> 00:27:35,845
because there was no mass in His body,
no matter in His body. No matter.

232
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:41,371
No element, except for Chaitanya itself.

233
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:46,963
Omkara becoming Ganesha in the mud,

234
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:52,602
or the what you can say, the thing that
came out of Her body.

235
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:57,400
Only the Chaitanya. So at Ganesha's stage
we can say

236
00:27:57,601 --> 00:28:02,291
that the Chaitanya was kept in that form,

237
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:09,154
but in the state of Christ it was no
longer there.

238
00:28:12,402 --> 00:28:18,011
But the whole drama was played later on,
of His death and resurrection,

239
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:22,262
because He is the One who is responsible
for our resurrection,

240
00:28:22,463 --> 00:28:27,802
because He is the Gate. He is the Path
because He is Shri Ganesh.

241
00:28:28,003 --> 00:28:34,205
Omkara is the Path, and He is the Gate,
but He is not the destination.

242
00:28:37,271 --> 00:28:40,862
His Mother is the destination.

243
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:47,773
Even Mahalakshmi is not the Destination.
Even Mahakali, Mahasaraswati.

244
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:53,463
It's the Adi Shakti is the destination
where you have to reach.

245
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,603
All these things were never told
in the Bible

246
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:04,379
because He could hardly live for four
years with public life.

247
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,177
Nor did they want to tell about it because
they did not know.

248
00:29:09,378 --> 00:29:16,008
Also there was a definite suppression
of all Divine things,

249
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:20,848
for these people are all commercialized
institutions,

250
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:24,996
as we have also in India all kinds
of commercial institutions.

251
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:30,628
But the only advantage in India is that
religion is not organized.

252
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:33,447
Thank God for that!

253
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:36,032
But they organized it, they organized
Christ,

254
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,990
they organized all His principles,
everything,

255
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:42,674
and now they think He was a good human
being.

256
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:46,027
What a certificate to give!

257
00:29:48,268 --> 00:29:53,636
So today we are here to celebrate
the birth of Omkara.

258
00:29:53,837 --> 00:29:58,933
It's a very big thing. I don't know
if you can realize it, what it is,

259
00:29:59,134 --> 00:30:06,551
which moves into everything, whether it is
anu, paramanu, is the atom, molecules,

260
00:30:06,752 --> 00:30:14,022
into all the organizing of chemicals and
also the periodic laws,

261
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:23,380
and also in the gravity, into everything
that moves is this Omkara,

262
00:30:23,581 --> 00:30:28,690
and your vibrations are nothing but
Omkaras.

263
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:34,067
Actually, in My photograph the vibrations
have come as Omkaras.

264
00:30:34,268 --> 00:30:38,749
On the head of the people there is Omkara
written.

265
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:44,239
How is it happening, these lights look
like Omkara?

266
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,797
How is it on top of the heads of the Sahaja
Yogis,

267
00:30:47,998 --> 00:30:51,816
there's - all the Sahaja Yogis' heads -
there is Omkara?

268
00:30:52,017 --> 00:31:00,899
Or Allah in Arabic language, My name
also, in Arabic?

269
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:06,007
Who is doing this?

270
00:31:08,788 --> 00:31:12,599
It is He who is doing all those things.

271
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:22,105
So Omkara itself takes a form to do things
to convince you of Adi Shakti.

272
00:31:22,306 --> 00:31:29,803
He is the One who is handling all these
powers.

273
00:31:31,616 --> 00:31:36,611
He doesn't enter into the photograph,
no, He does not,

274
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:40,473
but He plays a trick.

275
00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:46,717
After all you see, if you go into details,
how do you get a photograph?

276
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:52,292
Through the light. The light passes
straight, in a straight line.

277
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:57,032
But if He wants, He can make the light
pass another way round.

278
00:31:57,233 --> 00:32:00,792
He can just transform the light into
something else.

279
00:32:00,993 --> 00:32:04,083
He can do whatever He likes.

280
00:32:04,284 --> 00:32:08,460
And that's what He does to convince you.

281
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:11,869
And He said that "Anything against Me
I'll tolerate,

282
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,630
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

283
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:20,189
And this Holy Ghost is the Adi Shakti.

284
00:32:21,728 --> 00:32:28,974
Without Him you cannot go to the Sahasrara.

285
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:32,422
So the in the whole play He is like
the sutra dhara,

286
00:32:32,623 --> 00:32:36,420
He is the One who is the conductor,

287
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:43,188
the One moves the strings in a puppet show.

288
00:32:43,389 --> 00:32:46,250
And so it is very important to pray
to Shri Ganesha,

289
00:32:46,451 --> 00:32:49,307
every time we have Puja, we have
to pray to Him

290
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:56,005
and we, that's how we are praying to Lord
Jesus Christ. Every time.

291
00:32:56,206 --> 00:33:01,569
Without His auspiciousness, without His
help, we cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

292
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:08,328
He is the Manager. See, I am sitting
here and He is the manager.

293
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:12,460
Supposing there is no management, how
will I speak here?

294
00:33:12,661 --> 00:33:15,889
Nothing can happen. But He is so efficient,

295
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:21,827
and you never see Him working out
everything, doing everything.

296
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,180
(Hindi talk)
