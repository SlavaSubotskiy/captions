1
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:29,170
Today we have such a great opportunity to
celebrate the birth of Christ.

2
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,840
He was born in a manger.

3
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,530
All these things are already pre-planned.

4
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:54,409
That He should be born in a manger in difficult
situations, to show that whether you are born

5
00:05:54,409 --> 00:06:06,324
poor or rich, whether you are born in difficulties
or in problems, if you have Divinity within

6
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:12,057
you it shines by itself.

7
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:30,055
As the Christianity took a very wrong deviated
line, they have never been able to understand

8
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,317
the significance of Christ.

9
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:43,151
To them immaculate conception is absolutely
not possible.

10
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:49,468
Most of the people think that it's some sort
of a mythical story.

11
00:06:49,468 --> 00:07:10,609
But in India we do believe that Gauri created
Shri Ganesha out of Her own vibrations and

12
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:15,719
that He became the Deity of Mooladhara.

13
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:18,799
We accept it.

14
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:19,949
But not in the West.

15
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:27,819
They will never accept such a thing because
their mental side is over-developed and dominates

16
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:32,419
them.

17
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:44,058
Maybe they are not so very old like Indians
to understand that above all He is God.

18
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:48,439
Even the concept of God is quite mental.

19
00:07:48,439 --> 00:08:00,039
Moreover, the way Christianity has been, it
has not provided any proper guidance.

20
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:07,749
On the contrary wherever they have failed
they said: "It's a mystery."

21
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:15,099
But it's very simple to understand for Indians,
that anything is possible for God.

22
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:18,898
After all He is God.

23
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,939
He is God Almighty.

24
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:32,070
Because of this mental attitude which is much
lower than the knowledge of your spirit, the

25
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:42,698
ordinary, mundane type of the superficial
knowledge can never allow the personality

26
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:46,319
to accept the greatness of God.

27
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:50,469
I had a grandma.

28
00:08:50,469 --> 00:09:01,799
She was My father's aunt and she used to tell
us a nice story about somebody who was going

29
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,799
to meet God.

30
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,778
Of course this - in India everybody understands
all these things.

31
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:09,299
They will not say: "How he is going to meet
God?" but they accept.

32
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,288
All right, he is going to meet God.

33
00:09:11,288 --> 00:09:18,349
So when he was going on the way, on the road,
he found one gentleman sitting there nicely

34
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:26,649
singing songs, bhajans of God, doing nothing
on the roadside.

35
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,579
So he said: "Oh, so you are going to meet
God?"

36
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:32,369
"Yes, I am going to meet Him.

37
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:34,929
So have you any message for Him?"

38
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:41,359
"Yes, please tell Him that I'm all right,
but He should arrange for my food, because

39
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,819
I think the food is now finishing."

40
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:48,908
He said: "Really, that's what you want me
to tell Him?"

41
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:51,959
"Yes, yes, please tell Him.

42
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,669
Oh, of course He'll arrange, but please tell
Him."

43
00:09:57,669 --> 00:10:04,782
So he went ahead and he met another gentleman
who was standing on his head, or in a Christian

44
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:09,246
way I would say he was going to church every
day with nice suits, and singing hymns every

45
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:12,432
day, listening to the pastor's sermons, or
whatever you may say; and in the Indian way

46
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:18,943
we can say he was going to the temple every
day, standing on his head, doing all kinds

47
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:22,059
of yoga asanas and everything.

48
00:10:22,084 --> 00:10:26,793
And he asked him: "Please go and ask God - I've
tried everything.

49
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:28,894
When is He going to meet me?

50
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,274
I would like to see Him.

51
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:32,044
I would like to have His darshan."

52
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:33,253
He said: "All right."

53
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:47,074
So he went to God, and whatever work he had
he finished with it, and then God asked him:

54
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:48,716
"Have you got anything to tell Me?"

55
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:57,026
He said: "Nothing much, but I met one gentleman
while coming and he said that 'I'm doing all

56
00:10:57,026 --> 00:11:01,011
kinds of things, I have tried everything,
and when will God meet me?

57
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:06,365
I am standing on my head, and I am doing also
all kinds of yoga asanas, and all kinds of

58
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:12,913
things, and also I am going to church and
mosque, I am praying, doing all sorts of prayers,

59
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,346
but when will God meet me?'"

60
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:20,409
So God said: "Tell him he has to do a little
more.

61
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:21,846
See, it's not easy.

62
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:35,681
When Sahaja Yoga will come we'll see!"

63
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:41,477
So then even he said: "And there is another
one who was on the road, You see.

64
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:46,212
As he was just enjoying himself singing songs,
he suddenly saw me, and he told me: 'You see,

65
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:50,172
my food is now finishing, ask God to arrange
it for me.'"

66
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:52,508
He said: "Really, is the food just finishing?"

67
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:56,733
Immediately God said: "What are you doing,
why don't you go and look after him?

68
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:57,733
His food is finishing."

69
00:11:57,733 --> 00:12:00,203
"No, no, Sir, we yesterday only, we arranged
it, all that."

70
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:02,513
He said: "All right, all right, doesn't matter."

71
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:06,703
You see, he couldn't understand, you know,
that this fellow who is trying all these things

72
00:12:06,703 --> 00:12:10,112
and God is still saying that he has to wait.

73
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:14,773
And while this fellow is just singing songs
of God and all that, and why is it so much

74
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:23,803
impressed by this another fellow who is doing
nothing to seek God?

75
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:26,533
So then God realized that he is in some sort
of an illusion.

76
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:30,543
So He told him: "All right, you go and tell
them one thing.

77
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:39,283
To both of them the same thing, that 'When
I went to God what I saw there was that He

78
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:46,937
made a camel pass through the eye of a needle.'"

79
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:50,082
So he said: "Really, I should tell them?"

80
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:54,173
"Yes, yes, you just tell them, and see the
reaction."

81
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,173
So he went down.

82
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:58,342
So this is, the first one met him, he said:
"What God has said?"

83
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:02,573
He said that God has said: "Wait till Sahaja
Yoga comes in, then I'll meet you.

84
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,302
Before that you'll go around like this."

85
00:13:04,302 --> 00:13:06,742
"Oh God, when will this Sahaja Yoga come?"

86
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:09,295
And he said: "So, but He'll meet me sometime.

87
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,566
I hope Sahaja Yoga also comes some time."

88
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:17,104
And he was quite disappointed.

89
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:18,212
So he went.

90
00:13:18,236 --> 00:13:23,683
And he asked him that: "What did you see with,
there when you went to see God?"

91
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:30,779
He said: "I saw that, you know, He passed
a camel through the eye of an, of a needle."

92
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,268
He said: "What?

93
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:34,268
How is it possible?

94
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:35,268
It's impossible!"

95
00:13:35,268 --> 00:13:36,268
(Now mental.)

96
00:13:36,268 --> 00:13:41,228
"How is it possible, that a camel gets passed
through the eye, it's not possible, see the

97
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:44,159
volume of this one and such a little thing.

98
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,199
How can he pass?

99
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,039
No, no, no, no you are just telling me a story
because you have been to God, you are trying

100
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,189
to show off, that's all.

101
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:53,119
I, I don't believe in all this nonsense.

102
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:57,489
It's.. you are just telling me lies, and don't
try to befool me."

103
00:13:57,489 --> 00:14:01,319
So he went to another person who was on the
street eating nicely.

104
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:02,919
He said: "How are you?"

105
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:06,909
"I know He had arranged before you reached
there, I know it was all right after all.

106
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:08,819
You see He looks after me all the time.

107
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:11,348
So what did you see when you went there?"

108
00:14:11,348 --> 00:14:18,929
He said: "I saw that God Almighty passed a
camel through an eye of a needle.

109
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:20,988
It's a very amazing thing."

110
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:23,107
He said: "What, amazing?

111
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:25,862
He is God, do you know He is God?

112
00:14:25,862 --> 00:14:28,242
Do you know He is God?

113
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,876
God can do anything.

114
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:33,378
He can do anything!"

115
00:14:33,403 --> 00:14:42,415
That's made him understand, that if you understand
that God is all-powerful, all-powerful, it

116
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,456
doesn't mean that He can move Himalayas to
Maharashtra.

117
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:59,281
It doesn't mean that!

118
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:01,931
But it means He is all powerful.

119
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:09,531
Means He can do subtlest and subtlest thing,
and such things which our brain, this mental

120
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:11,840
side cannot understand.

121
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,871
It's beyond the conception of a human mind.

122
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:24,001
This is what God is.

123
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:26,811
He's the One who has created human beings.

124
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:28,651
He has to be beyond us if He is creating.

125
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:32,251
If a potter creates a pot that means he is
beyond the pot.

126
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:34,550
Pot cannot create God.. the potter.

127
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:43,771
And the potter has created the pot, so that
means that this pot which is created by him

128
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:49,691
has to be something which is made by him,
so he has to be much more powerful than the

129
00:15:49,691 --> 00:15:53,981
pot is.

130
00:15:53,981 --> 00:16:04,801
But it is unbelievable, or say beyond the
conception of human beings, that what a God

131
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:12,791
it must be Who has made this great computer.

132
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:16,221
We take everything for granted.

133
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:23,011
We cannot even make a particle of clay ourself.

134
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:25,791
We cannot make anything, human beings cannot
make.

135
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,911
Ha, if there is some stone, all right you
can put this up.

136
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:34,151
If there is some clay you can make some sort
of a house out of it.

137
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:37,031
That's all dead from the dead.

138
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:50,231
But can you make a candle which will burn
badhas?

139
00:16:50,231 --> 00:17:02,570
You have seen it with your own eyes that before
My photograph the badhas burn.

140
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,491
Can you do that?

141
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:22,560
Now you, we have no, also the idea of the
complete, intricate working, delicate machinery,

142
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:31,861
and also very dynamic explosive machinery,
how it works to create human beings, to create

143
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:38,561
all this universe, to create all these beautiful
flowers and trees and everything.

144
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:41,791
Look at the stars.

145
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,041
Look at how many they are.

146
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:50,611
Out of that He has chosen this Mother Earth
to create human beings.

147
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:55,851
How He has made it?

148
00:17:55,851 --> 00:18:07,141
When He wants to send His own Son, He can
send it the way He wants to send it.

149
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:22,710
Even to challenge this shows the mental mind
which is in, absolutely in mud.

150
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:32,151
So to accept it is only possible when you
have saints, real saints who tell you, that

151
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:39,580
this is how Shri Ganesha was born out of Gauri.

152
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:51,311
But to jump into it, into faith, when you
come to Sahaja Yoga you start seeing miracles

153
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:54,651
taking place.

154
00:18:54,651 --> 00:19:00,700
Then you can understand that these miracles
are taking place and if there is another miracle

155
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,420
that has to take place it will take place
in any case.

156
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,330
We are not doing anything, it is all done.

157
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,960
And we don't doubt it.

158
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:22,551
Once you doubt you become again the same human
being which is just embedded in the mud.

159
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:29,121
I always say that you are like lotuses now
opened out.

160
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:32,101
You are not flying in the air.

161
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:34,911
Your roots are down there.

162
00:19:34,911 --> 00:19:44,731
But you are now lotuses, and that's what is
on top of the lotus, this Mahalakshmi principle

163
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:46,191
is born.

164
00:19:46,191 --> 00:19:59,820
Mahalakshmi principle is the One which came
on this earth as Sitaji, as Radha and also

165
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:05,830
as Mary, as Mother Mary.

166
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,361
It's said that Mahalakshmi is born out of
the sea.

167
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:13,151
What is the meaning of "Mary"?

168
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:18,231
Maria means, you know, Mare means "the sea".

169
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:23,291
She was born out of the sea.

170
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:29,431
So She being a Mahalakshmi Herself, She could
create a child.

171
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:32,521
What's the harm?

172
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:42,251
She could do anything, and this is the thing
you have to rise above.

173
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:48,971
Christians have to rise above this Christianity,
and has to understand that it's such a great

174
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:54,381
thing that was Christ Who came on this earth,
Who was the Incarnation of the principle of

175
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:57,481
Ganesha.

176
00:20:57,481 --> 00:21:03,791
Ganesha becoming Mahavishnu is a very big
thing which one should try to understand.

177
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:09,451
Ganesha is the Son of Shiva.

178
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:25,371
Shri Ganesha is the One Who was first created
before creating anything, any atmosphere,

179
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:35,481
anything, because He is the Omkara, and the
Omkara is the first breaking of Adi Shakti

180
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:36,481
from Shiva.

181
00:21:36,481 --> 00:21:40,611
That sound, "Tan-kar", as they call it.

182
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:48,070
From there started Omkara and He is the One
Who is the embodiment of that Omkara.

183
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:57,070
So this sound is Shri Ganesh, is His power,
was created first foremost thing, just to

184
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,580
create holiness [SOUNDS LIKE povitrada].

185
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:07,561
When this holiness was created, this [povitrada]
was created, then everything was created in

186
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:13,550
the sea of that holiness.

187
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:27,231
And then He incarnated as Christ, but as Mahavishnu,
not as Shiva's Son, but as Mahavishnu.

188
00:22:27,231 --> 00:22:28,371
And who is Vishnu?

189
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:35,721
Is an uncle of Shri Ganesh.

190
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:40,465
His Mother's brother is Shri Vishnu.

191
00:22:40,949 --> 00:22:52,361
So He was brought up, we should say, by Mahavishnu,
we can say, but Mahalakshmi adopted the principle

192
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:54,171
of Shri Ganesh.

193
00:22:54,171 --> 00:23:01,181
In the Kundalini chart you can see that the
Shri Ganesha is connected on the left hand

194
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:12,581
side to the Ida Nadi, and the Kundalini is
above that.

195
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:21,041
So now what has happened is this, that He
transcended that part, and if He had to come

196
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:28,031
for the redemption, He had to come as the
Son of Mahalakshmi.

197
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:34,891
So it was Mahalakshmi who adopted Him, or
we should say really, conceived Him within

198
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:45,511
Himself as Christ, and He became Mahavishnu.

199
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:53,911
Anything is possible in the family of Gods
and Goddesses, because they are Gods.

200
00:23:53,911 --> 00:24:05,421
It is beyond human mind to understand how
these things are working out in that realm.

201
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:07,271
Very difficult.

202
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:13,431
But now you have got Realization you can feel
in the cool breeze, so many new things are

203
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:14,821
happening to you.

204
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:23,801
So now believe Me, that there is no unholy
alliances among the Gods and Goddesses, no

205
00:24:23,801 --> 00:24:24,861
unholy alliances.

206
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:30,171
There is nothing that is human in them.

207
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:34,941
They're all divine, pure people.

208
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:47,521
Once you understand this point then you will
understand why Shri Ganesha had to accept

209
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:57,420
to be a Son of Mahalakshmi, was born to Him
as Christ.

210
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:09,311
Because He had to come on Agnya, and for the
redemption as Ganesha, He doesn't do the redemption

211
00:25:09,311 --> 00:25:19,741
part, because at that stage He is for the
innocence, for the holiness, for the wisdom

212
00:25:19,741 --> 00:25:26,861
or also for destroying the negativity.

213
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:37,181
But He had to come up, only He, only Ganesha
could be brought to this very constricted

214
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:43,541
chakra, Agnya chakra.

215
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,991
Now why is it constricted?

216
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:48,432
It's quite a scientific thing which I would
not like to discuss today.

217
00:25:48,432 --> 00:25:55,709
But it had to be constricted and it goes on
getting more constricted, this Agnya chakra,

218
00:25:55,734 --> 00:26:04,411
the more, the more we think, the more we go
into the left or right, it goes on really

219
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:08,131
becoming like this, absolutely like this.

220
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:18,711
So in this very subtle area only Christ could
be subtle, because He's the subtlest of subtle.

221
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:29,671
He's even subtler than an atom, because in
the atom those vibrations which move asymmetric

222
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:34,681
and symmetric movements are subtler than the
atom.

223
00:26:34,681 --> 00:26:40,451
And this is the subtler of that also.

224
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:52,051
So in that little very constricted area, only
a personality like Christ, which is nothing

225
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:54,201
but purity.

226
00:26:54,201 --> 00:27:06,891
There is no other element in Him but purity.

227
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:17,351
All other Incarnations have all the five elements
in it.

228
00:27:17,351 --> 00:27:18,351
He has nothing.

229
00:27:18,351 --> 00:27:24,241
He is nothing but pure vibrations.

230
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:32,161
That's why He could walk on the water, because
there was no mass in His body, no matter in

231
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:33,161
His body.

232
00:27:33,161 --> 00:27:35,011
No matter.

233
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:41,651
No element, except for Chaitanya itself.

234
00:27:41,651 --> 00:27:50,461
Omkara becoming Ganesha in the mud, or the
what you can say, the thing that came out

235
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:51,461
of Her body.

236
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:55,271
Only the Chaitanya.

237
00:27:55,271 --> 00:28:03,231
So at Ganesha's stage we can say that the
Chaitanya was kept in that form, but in the

238
00:28:03,231 --> 00:28:10,271
state of Christ it was not there.

239
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:19,591
But the whole drama was played later on, of
His death and resurrection, because He is

240
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:25,901
the One who is responsible for our resurrection,
because He is the Gate.

241
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:28,091
He's the Path because He's Shri Ganesh.

242
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:37,561
Omkara is the Path, and He's the Gate, but
He is not the destination.

243
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:41,311
His Mother is the destination.

244
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:46,131
Even Mahalakshmi is not the Destination.

245
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:47,381
Even Mahakali, Mahasaraswati.

246
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:55,261
It's the Adi Shakti is the destination where
you have to reach.

247
00:28:55,261 --> 00:29:01,101
All these things were never told in the Bible,
because He could hardly live for four years

248
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:03,343
with public life.

249
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:12,221
Nor did they want to tell about it because
they did not know, also there was a definite

250
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:20,271
suppression of all Divine things, for these
people are all commercialized institutions,

251
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:24,651
as we have also in India all kinds of commercial
institutions.

252
00:29:24,651 --> 00:29:30,411
But the only advantage in India is that religion
is not organized.

253
00:29:30,411 --> 00:29:32,441
Thank God for that!

254
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:39,441
But they organized it, they organized Christ,
they organized all His principles, everything,

255
00:29:39,441 --> 00:29:43,271
and now they think He was a good human being.

256
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:47,771
What a certificate to give Him!

257
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:53,191
So today we are here to celebrate the birth
of Omkara.

258
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,241
It's a very big thing.

259
00:29:55,241 --> 00:30:01,921
I don't know if you can realize it, what it
is, which moves into everything, whether it

260
00:30:01,921 --> 00:30:11,401
is [SOUNDS LIKE anu, paramanu], is the atom,
molecules, into all the organizing of chemicals

261
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:22,551
and also the periodic laws, and also in the
gravity, into every thing that moves is this

262
00:30:22,551 --> 00:30:26,941
Omkara, and your vibrations are nothing but
Omkaras.

263
00:30:26,941 --> 00:30:33,621
Actually, in My photograph the vibrations
have come as Omkaras.

264
00:30:33,621 --> 00:30:39,591
On the head of the people there is Omkara
written.

265
00:30:39,591 --> 00:30:44,651
How is it happening, these lights look like
Omkara?

266
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:50,331
How is it on top of the heads of the Sahaja
Yogis, there's all the Sahaja Yogis' heads,

267
00:30:50,331 --> 00:31:02,901
there is Omkara? - or Allah in Arabic language
- My name also, in Arabic.

268
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:06,551
Who is doing this?

269
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:13,781
It is He who is doing all this.

270
00:31:13,781 --> 00:31:22,491
So Omkara itself takes a form to do things
to convince you of Adi Shakti.

271
00:31:22,491 --> 00:31:29,271
He's the One who is handling all these powers.

272
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:38,601
He doesn't enter into the photograph, no,
He does not, but He plays a trick.

273
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:46,101
After all you see, if you go into details,
how do you get a photograph?

274
00:31:46,101 --> 00:31:47,131
Through the light.

275
00:31:47,131 --> 00:31:51,421
The light passes straight, a straight line.

276
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:57,511
But if He wants He can make the light pass
another way round.

277
00:31:57,511 --> 00:32:00,710
He can just transform the light into something
else.

278
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:03,861
He can do whatever He likes.

279
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:07,201
And that's what He does to convince you.

280
00:32:07,201 --> 00:32:15,991
And He said that: "Anything against Me I'll
tolerate, but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

281
00:32:15,991 --> 00:32:22,121
And this Holy Ghost is the Adi Shakti.

282
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:29,371
Without Him you cannot go to the Sahasrara.

283
00:32:29,371 --> 00:32:35,351
So that in the whole play He is like the [SOUNDS
LIKE sutra dhara], He's the One who is the

284
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:41,811
conductor, the One moves the strings in a
puppet show.

285
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:48,071
And so it is very important to pray to Shri
Ganesha every time we have Puja.

286
00:32:48,071 --> 00:32:55,911
We have to pray to Him and we, that's how
we are praying to Lord Jesus Christ.

287
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:56,911
Every time.

288
00:32:56,911 --> 00:33:02,261
Without His auspiciousness, without His help,
we cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

289
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:03,731
He's the Manager.

290
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:08,731
See I'm sitting here and He's the manager.

291
00:33:08,731 --> 00:33:13,021
Supposing there's no management how will I
speak here?

292
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:14,281
Nothing can happen.

293
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:19,791
But He is so efficient, and you never see
Him working out everything, doing everything.
