See this [UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]

3
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:32,026
- We've felt quite often we have our open right heart.
- Right heart?

4
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:40,006
Right heart will be those people, who came and killed many people

5
00:00:41,526 --> 00:00:47,426
This was a major center of colonizing [UNCLEAR]

6
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:54,966
- the organizing for the colonizing of countries started from this. It was all...
- Did they come here to the Spaniards or...?

7
00:00:55,166 --> 00:01:01,746
- The money was here, the banks were here, the organizers were here
- Oh, I see, that's how..

8
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:09,226
- That sorted [UNCLEAR]
- Oh,
- and even when the government shifted to Wellington, it was still

9
00:01:10,586 --> 00:01:16,426
- it was still Auckland which ...
- worked it out.
- [UNCLEAR]

10
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:25,286
I feel that, you see, all things, these things are of

11
00:01:25,646 --> 00:01:30,046
the past and we have a special category of human-beings born now-a-days.

12
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:50,046
- Come to the Feet.
- You can now use that one, if you want.
-  ..... while they're decorating the Feet [UNCLEAR]

13
00:01:55,286 --> 00:02:01,286
- Now you can put it there in there, in that.
- [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah

14
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:29,586
All the colors of My feet are there - yellow and the red.

15
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:44,586
- What's that flower is?
- It's [UNCLEAR]
- Annh?

16
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:49,446
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes. You don't get this in India.

17
00:02:49,826 --> 00:02:54,026
[UNCLEAR] they always [UNCLEAR]

18
00:02:58,146 --> 00:03:01,706
But the vibrations are like that.

19
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:12,346
- This is Warren's idea.
- What is his idea?

20
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:18,766
[UNCLEAR - SAREE IS THE...?]

21
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:34,846

- Mother, it's a great privilege for us to have You here.
- May God...

00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:38,206
Ladies can also [UNCLEAR]

23
00:03:41,686 --> 00:03:48,726
Such a great thing! I was just thinking - normally, I could never have thought of New Zealand being visited, but for you

24
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:54,046
and for your efforts.

25
00:03:54,306 --> 00:04:00,886
Yes, you all have to go for it in a double way.

26
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:17,986
- Warren wanted to be [UNCLEAR]
- What is [UNCLEAR]

27
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:25,226
- Probably, they got it in the same amount that they had - everything - so many; They'll show you all of them.
- We decided to buy among those [UNCLEAR]

28
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:32,046
for Mother, for the marriages in Sydney. We had enough left time to buy

29
00:04:32,326 --> 00:04:35,526
something to go with it for New Zealand [UNCLEAR].

30
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:41,766
- Mother, for presenting [UNCLEAR]
- Alright - the price has to be removed.

31
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:47,526
- Just take the tag out.
- You have to double it, you have to double it

32
00:04:51,186 --> 00:04:56,606
This is a nice color. What do you call this color? Is this we call it onion color - pyaji

33
00:04:56,906 --> 00:05:04,266
- Mushroom
- Mushroom
- Mushroom? Mushrooms have this color?

34
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:11,846
- Yes, yes.
- Do they? Alright.
- The beauty, isn't it, Mother?
- Very beautiful, I tell you, really. What a choice!

35
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:15,726
- Yeah.
- Is a beautiful sari.

36
00:05:20,506 --> 00:05:26,446
You see, we had gone for that bumper sale, where we got everything very cheap and then Warren had an idea,

37
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:31,766
that he should buy something for every center that is beautiful. Alright.

38
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:39,866
[UNCLEAR] now you double it. Yes, now take it around, back [UNCLEAR]

39
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:47,846
- See, one of you come around here. Take it through
- That's better.
- Put it over, wrap it around

40
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:52,486
Make it double. It's beautiful. I tell you, that color is so beautiful.

41
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:57,306
Really, the most beautiful one you gave it to Auckland.

42
00:05:57,546 --> 00:06:01,806
- Yeah
- [UNCLEAR]
- Can you [UNCLEAR] it Mother?
- [UNCLEAR]

43
00:06:04,486 --> 00:06:09,706
It's really beautiful! It's like a lotus - the color is.

44
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:28,006
This thing is another; Just came as a by-product.[UNCLEAR] It's nice - isn't it?

45
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:34,166
- This is beautiful; It's beautiful!
- [UNCLEAR]
- We can say it beautiful but also

46
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:40,086
Mother, we are offering it to You, Shri Mataji - we didn't, we didn't choose it but we're very grateful that his choice

47
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:47,126
- It's very delicate and nice, really
- Everyone has seen it.
- Seen it - alright. Thank you very much, thank you. May God bless you!

48
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:53,606
- You like the design? Isn't it nice? [UNCLEAR - RARE STONE?]
- We just have to buy, Mother, a nice little chain

49
00:06:53,946 --> 00:07:00,886
- That we'll buy; Mother can buy something also [UNCLEAR - THIS TYPE OR THIS TIME?]

50
00:07:01,206 --> 00:07:07,406
May God bless you! It's beautiful, this one is a beautiful sari

51
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:14,626
It's really beautiful! I wish people also become warm like this.

52
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:21,346
I think, My eyes were closed when he took one for Me.

53
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:28,146
You must take the whole - that's the way. That's the best.

54
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:34,346
- Cheryl is a great photographer
- I know she is. Yes, you did some very good ones even.

55
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:55,266
This little Matthews is another one. I don't know how he gets it so spontaneously - beautiful photographs!

56

[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION BETWEEN YOGIS]

57
00:08:02,546 --> 00:08:06,286
- [UNCLEAR] this is the one and another one just before this.
- Yes

58
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:13,006
- Is just, I tell you, so beautiful
- There were three with the, with us

- I see

That shows there wrapped up in the lotus

Yes

82
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:12,866
It's very good. Is this the same video or is a different?

83
00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:26,146
It's different - isn't it? It's coming out very well. Very good, very clear. [UNCLEAR - SO?] very clear.

84
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:39,866
Brian's in  the business - it should be. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

85
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:45,206
First thing about using machinery and nothing about, nothing

86
00:11:45,946 --> 00:11:53,286
Like Me; I'm so bad, I'm very bad at it. See, machinery I just can't think of, really.

87
00:11:55,526 --> 00:12:03,586
Just don't know what is machinery is really because.... it's very good, it's coming out very well.

88
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:16,506
- It has to be in an angle all the time?
- No, so You can see it, Mother.
- That's the thing is, yes. It's very good.

89
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:31,146
It's so nice to be here again. I have to come again once more. I was telling him how we are going to manage that.

90
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:39,086
- You have to get an around the world tour
- You see, it is true. What you said Me that, "People are so conditioned and absolutely

91
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:46,986
frozen into it," but we shouldn't worry about those people. They are not all - they are very few,

92
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:54,346
actually, such people are. The people who, they may be at the helm of affairs, they might be the controlling people and all that,

93
00:12:54,626 --> 00:13:01,406
on the whole, I think that, the general public, you see, has that feeling still -

94
00:13:02,086 --> 00:13:08,506
they can be brought around. I told you, fifty percent of Australia, I have a feeling, are seekers -

95
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:12,686
- fifty percent are seekers
- Hmm, that's tremendous.

96
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:18,126
but they're lost. I'm not saying that they are all available to Sahaja Yoga but they're lost but they are.

97
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:25,566
- They're like lost sheep - they are to be found.
- We have to start a campaign - that's all. We have to really start a campaign.

98
00:13:26,086 --> 00:13:29,046
Can start a campaign; You can do it, no doubt.

99
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:37,186
A message came through last night from [UNCLEAR] from Warren, saying that You had said that

100
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:44,186
campaigning was necessary and that [UNCLEAR] to a certain extent actions today with the press -

101
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:49,226
normally are very civilized, quite straightforward and they

102
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:53,746
- [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]
- [UNCLEAR] indecent
- today I

103
00:13:55,126 --> 00:14:02,786
[UNCLEAR] quite strong about,  "Campaigning, campaigning in there?" so I was [UNCLEAR]

104
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:10,586
But you have to get after them, the way they are, you see. They are so much used to protests and so much used to very heavy

105
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:16,846
blasting that they cannot stand, I mean, they cannot understand that there could be mild

106
00:14:17,426 --> 00:14:22,986
people, there are people who are trying to just go out in a very beautiful way

107
00:14:24,626 --> 00:14:31,346
but, I think, if the Truth is not accepted, you have to break many things, you have to break many things

108
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:38,046
because it will manifest itself by breaking so many things  - you'll better to warn them, better to warn them.

109
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:46,886
Only shackles will be left out of them. If it has to come out it will come out and come out in a very big way and they'll be left

110
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:55,626
untold. It's better to tell them openly; Better to tell them that this is what it is; Is the Last Judgment, no doubt.

111
00:14:58,926 --> 00:15:06,326
As it is so many things are happening like, now they are challenging Christ and His Immaculate birth, His

112
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:11,286
about His miracles - everything is under challenge so what are they talking now?

113
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:19,006
So they, after some time they'll have to make Mr. Paul as they will come out Pauleen religion.

114
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:32,266
I don't know what's the meaning of Paul in Hebrew or in Roman language.

115
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:38,226
- It's a Roman..
- Maybe, it's the one who's seen the light.

116
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:46,086
Paul, cannot [UNCLEAR] because it was in his name before that  - see in the light - not has been the light.

117
00:15:46,426 --> 00:15:50,666
- He was Soul of Tarsus.
- He was what?
- Soul of Tarsus.

118
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:56,926
- What's that?
- That's his name.
- That's Turkey - Tarsus was Turkey and he was of the Greek

119
00:15:57,826 --> 00:16:02,866
He was a Greek, he was a Jew of the D'Aspro which means [UNCLEAR] of Judiah

120
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:07,006
and he was really, what we call Turkey.

121
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:13,226
- He was Turkish?
- You know why, yes, that [UNCLEAR]
- He belonged to Rome.

122
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:18,246
He belonged to the Roman Empire as a citizen but also was a Greek

123
00:16:18,626 --> 00:16:23,166
because he was part of Turkey which was then owned by the Greek Empire.

124
00:16:24,746 --> 00:16:32,466
- He became Paul after his
- Oh, I see
- after the Buddha came,
- Then he became Paul.

125
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:41,586
after he hit his head on a stone, after he fell off a horse, after he top of a donkey, had a [UNCLEAR]

126
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:47,526
changed one hallucination for another

127
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:52,326
That's how he became Paul.

128
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,846
- Paulo is an Italian name.
- Paulo, means what?

129
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:03,166
- It's folk.
- Annh?
- Folk, as we call it

130
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:12,026
So, he called himself an Italian then. First he was Greek, then he became the Turk, then ... I tell you

131
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:20,486
- He was a Greek Turk who was a Jew and a Roman citizen.
- Luckily the Turks, the Turks are not so traditional people

132
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:27,486
- why?
- He's not very traditional, Mother.
- but Greeks are. Greeks are traditional, so how can he be Greek?

133
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:30,866
[UNCLEAR]

134
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:40,186
Must be something, you see, because what I'm saying, that see this Turk, Turkey might have been captured later on by Greek people

135
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:48,726
might have, they might have extended but there's no similarity in their faces or in anything but very different people to look at.

136
00:17:54,886 --> 00:18:02,126
- The whole Empire extended there, the cultural in the Greeks there - the education, the language
- Hmm

137
00:18:02,526 --> 00:18:09,506
- It seemed to override
- but Turks do not speak Greek language
- They used to, Mother, they used to.
- Achcha, but not now.

138
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:17,826
- After this Kemal Pasha they speak some other, it's a
- We had Mahamadim, MahaIslama is the

139
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:30,366
- Tonight [UNCLEAR]
- Yes, that will be nice
- Why don't you take this?
- Alright. It's a beautiful sari actually - color is so nice

140
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:47,366
- Wipe My feet, I think, with a towel. This is the towel you can wipe
- [UNCLEAR] you can wash Them also
- No, it's alright.

141
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:54,446
Just wipe it fully [UNCLEAR] I can do it. Yes, yes, yes - They are very sturdy feet.

142
00:18:54,766 --> 00:19:00,766
- Very sturdy feet
- [UNCLEAR]

143
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:07,486
- They have worked very hard. Yesterday specially,  see how that man I put all My feet and all that

144
00:19:08,126 --> 00:19:11,426
Isn't it a beautiful combination?

145
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:25,266
Thank you. May God bless you!

146
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:37,426
We were just planning that supposing we go, we take a tour like

147
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:43,706
come to America and then travel with the Sun, you see,

148
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:51,966
then come to Auckland, Australia back - will be better; He was saying, "Yes, that way."

149
00:19:53,666 --> 00:20:00,966
"You travel with the Sun - will be better," he was saying. I don't know, this year, I don't know what's going to happen. As it is, 250 people, you know what it was.

150
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:06,526
- Terrible!
- Tremendous, tremendous!
- You came to Brahmapuri, Veedo? - you were not in them.

151
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:13,146
Oh, that was the best part - that was the climax and then the second one came when we went to

152
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:20,926
- Bordi, Bordi marriages. Who was there, one of you, any one of...?
- David. David was our representative, who was there right through.

153
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:26,166
- Oh, I see.
- He's in England now. He's gone home to England to spend little time with his parents.

154
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:32,066
- and he'll be back here in New Zealand in..
- He sent presents for you, your

155
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:39,566
- Yes, we received almost beautiful [UNCLEAR]
- he gave you for the Pujas and the things

156
00:20:39,966 --> 00:20:43,086
- beautiful, beautiful!

157
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:48,566
- but you know they are so particular about customs and things

158
00:20:50,506 --> 00:20:57,286
the last time that when they came to Australia they brought everything and just walked through

159
00:20:58,026 --> 00:21:01,946
They came like traders, nobody asked them - but you people they don't ask.

160
00:21:02,506 --> 00:21:10,326
The, you see, the residents they don't ask much but they thought I was an Indian maybe I'm carrying narcotics or something.

161
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:20,406
Rather unnerving Shri Mataji that New Zealand should be the one place, the first place where You're

162
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:25,126
- asked to open Your luggage
- Yes, because one becomes
- the customs people search

163
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:29,926
but they were really tired, you know, taking out everything, fixing up everything, they were tired.

164
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:36,766
I said, "I'm sorry for the trouble you have to take - really don't know what to [UNCLEAR]

165
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:46,886
How can they find a narcotic in, in searching a place like that? - they cannot.

166
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:53,046
I don't know what they were looking out for - just can't understand.

167
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:59,446
- They - I don't know what circumstances are. A diplomatic luggage is never
- Never -

168
00:21:59,846 --> 00:22:06,146
but what were they looking out for? This is something I can't still understand because the way they saw, you see, here and there

169
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:13,966
and just pushed their hands here and there - what can you get? if you have to carry narcotics, you have to go into the - isn't it? Under a [UNCLEAR] they should see.

170
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:26,546
- No answer.
- I just don't know what were they looking for.

171
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:45,206
See, the story about this is that, they wanted Me to buy a mangalsutra, you see,

172
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:51,926
so we went - they're very expensive; This one is about fourteen thousand rupees, you see.

173
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:59,866
so I said, "May get, may not get, I don't know," but they had a little small thing in that amount and that too silver and this. I said,

174
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:06,166
"Why do you want to waste all this money I have already got one thing with the diamonds, so let's buy something else, you see."

175
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:12,266
then suddenly I turned around that shop - all kind of junk was selling.

176
00:23:12,746 --> 00:23:18,966
So, suddenly I turned around and what I see, this little piece this form

177
00:23:19,346 --> 00:23:26,346
and next to that was another one, which is another very beautiful thing, which you will be surprised to see that

178
00:23:26,546 --> 00:23:33,846
it is made of the same, what you call that - coral - red coral;

179
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:40,406
I was very amazed, I said, "This is here," - I had never seen anything made like this in India, so brought it

180
00:23:40,806 --> 00:23:48,126
and that one and this one and a mangalsutra - three put together is the price of that - that one little thing that

181
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:54,826
and such a beautiful piece it - Warren - is he there?

182
00:23:55,386 --> 00:23:59,126
It's a kitchen, is it? It's a huge place.

183
00:24:01,686 --> 00:24:04,726
Kitchen is very big; Is that the kitchen?

184
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:12,866
- Kitchen is  very big.
- Sorry, Mother?
- Kitchen is  very big. Is it a kitchen or a dining-room?
- Sort of very well planned and nice

185
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:17,206
- Very nice! Now I was saying show them the coral thing you got from there
- Yes

186
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:24,906
I'm telling them the story of mangalsutra - everything in coral; this is coral, that one in coral - just imagine!

187
00:24:26,706 --> 00:24:32,266
- And this was all in the same place?
- Same place and that too was a Sunday, all the shops were closed

188
00:24:32,546 --> 00:24:39,926
only we had to go to Dadar to this shop and there we find this, you see, Sahaja - it is so Sahaja you can't imagine; We just can't believe it.

189
00:24:42,326 --> 00:24:47,246
And he was worrying, "Mother, it's Sunday, how will we.." We said, "Alright, I'll arrive at that point - let's see."

190
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:53,106
And there these things we got for the same price that we'd just have bought one mangalsutra.

191
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:58,866
One better than the other - it's miracles after miracles

192
00:24:59,086 --> 00:25:04,426
[UNCLEAR]  the art, you see. This is the mangalsutra see now, see, very nice with the coral.

193
00:25:04,906 --> 00:25:09,346
- This is the mangalsutra which we bought
- [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR] in gold

194
00:25:09,726 --> 00:25:15,366
- It's nice we bought yours
- Yes, yes
- Just let them see.

195
00:25:18,906 --> 00:25:23,426
[UNCLEAR] all the deities are very helpful to you, that's what I can say.

196
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:30,406
It's very different from others - done well.

197
00:25:38,986 --> 00:25:44,906
- This is another
- [UNCLEAR]
- Oh!

198
00:25:45,286 --> 00:25:48,886
- Just look at that!
- This is. - this goes with the mangalsutra.
-

199
00:25:49,706 --> 00:25:53,186
Just look at that - in the same price - can you believe it?

200
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:59,086
- Did You tell her, Mother, about we found a little mangalsutra like the one You're wearing
- Yes, yes
- quite as good as the one as She has

201
00:25:59,306 --> 00:26:06,106
Yes a very small, very small, much smaller  than this and that too a silver thing and all that in, so

202
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:14,286
- we were not very happy with it - just see that. It's a piece of art and they said that, "It's been with us for many days, many years

203
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:21,286
and this we cannot make, we cannot make again, we cannot repeat it even if You want us to, we cannot repeat it."

204
00:26:23,706 --> 00:26:31,266
- [UNCLEAR] color of great gold.
- This is 22 carat gold again - real gold

205
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:40,306
- Now this is another story
- This is all part of it the

206
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:44,906
- [UNCLEAR]
- of one piece - out of the one piece we got three pieces.

207
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:52,986
It is, it is most auspicious that this should be a combination of gifts because both Australia and New Zealand

208
00:26:53,366 --> 00:26:59,286
- are part of the same energy in the Universal sense
- That's what I'm saying - it is so.

209
00:26:59,506 --> 00:27:02,606
and also of coral means it's Ganesha's.

210
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:09,346
the coral to find, see, in the shop there were no corals, nothing, suddenly, these three pieces came up.

211
00:27:15,726 --> 00:27:23,766
- [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]
- That's all, it's good. What's that?
- That's some ginger [UNCLEAR - COOKIE?]

212
00:27:24,946 --> 00:27:28,826
Something sugary if you have [UNCLEAR] If you have any

213
00:27:29,186 --> 00:27:34,466
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

214
00:27:39,206 --> 00:27:46,726
- So well done!
- This is the
- This is another miracle.
- This is the gift that we're all getting from [UNCLEAR]

215
00:27:46,906 --> 00:27:50,326
- This is another miracle also, just see that
- For Haiwatha

216
00:27:55,326 --> 00:28:02,706
- Silver pearl - queen of the Universe. Like [UNCLEAR]
- Warren has a special gift, I must say.

217
00:28:05,346 --> 00:28:13,266
And I'm telling him, "Don't buy. Now, three you have bought, now don't buy this, I'm feeling shy." "This is but for birthday, Mother," I said, "Forget it."

218
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:20,386
Isn't it, [UNCLEAR] in the same amount - can you imagine - a little thing like that - even a smaller than that

219
00:28:20,706 --> 00:28:27,126
- than what She's wearing
- what I'm wearing
- about three
- much smaller - all these three things came in that amount.

220
00:28:29,946 --> 00:28:33,686
It was a coral day, I tell you.

221
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:50,286
- So much beautiful!
- Isn't it? See the workmanship. This is very beautiful, this one and every piece is different.

222
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:55,426
- Just let the camera have a look at it.
- Add the other pieces.
- Let [UNCLEAR]

223
00:28:58,746 --> 00:29:05,746
And they said, "We can't make it for You any other. This is the only one we have. We cannot make it."

224
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:14,926
- See this one - see the workmanship
- The [UNCLEAR]

225
00:29:16,226 --> 00:29:22,666
- Yeah
- It's just beautiful [UNCLEAR] ! Snuggle little look

226
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:27,686
-  Warren is very good.
- Bring it [UNCLEAR] put it in front of the camera - just let it see.

227
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:32,426
- He's luckier than Me; If I want to buy, I cannot get things.

228
00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:40,606
- Turn around.
- I think this is made here - isn't it?
- Yeah

229
00:29:40,786 --> 00:29:46,366
- Made from Australia, made here
- Made in New Zealand. Haan, just see how did I know.

230
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:54,246
- It is, it is actually painted by a relation of [NAME UNCLEAR] specially for You.
- haan, I see - beautiful!

231
00:29:54,566 --> 00:30:01,306
- Very good paint
- Her realization last year
- these daisies are there - three daisies. It's very beautiful!

232
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:10,346
They don't make things like that, normally but in Australia, I found [UNCLEAR] like that

233
00:30:11,086 --> 00:30:17,126
- Who made those - now the ones you gave Me?
- Cups, Mother?
- Not cups, the plates.

234
00:30:17,406 --> 00:30:24,166
- Oh, Joe
- Joe
- Joe Robin Reeds, Mother
- We have two [UNCLEAR] and two pujas as well

235
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:29,666
- Oh, is it [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]
- That's awesome!

236
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:33,286
- She's very generous too.
- She's so generous

237
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:41,026
- Did you each of these pieces costs of, each of these pieces costs - lot of money is
- It's pure gold
- Pure gold?

238
00:30:44,066 --> 00:30:49,266
- and She gives them by the dozen
- What is a beauty it is!

239
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:54,726
She's given Me one like this. Yes, I have one. It's beautiful, isn't it?

240
00:30:59,446 --> 00:31:04,066
It's beautiful! Beautiful, really beautiful.

241
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,566
It's very hard to get that red in [UNCLEAR] too.

242
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:19,646
This they will appreciate much more, anywhere, not the variety so much - it's beautiful!

243
00:31:19,826 --> 00:31:24,926
- Let us keep it for Puja - beautiful!
- Nice [UNCLEAR]

244
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:29,226
and this also one other, one other for gift

245
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:35,666
- which can grow, which is this
- but

246
00:31:39,446 --> 00:31:42,686
be careful.

247
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:56,006
- He's [UNCLEAR] all about a potter. He's a sahajayogi in Perth, in sense.
- In Perth?

248
00:31:56,406 --> 00:32:00,066
- In Perth
- It's beautiful
- and

249
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:11,066
Very good, very good. This is  very good. Even you see the different

250
00:32:11,466 --> 00:32:17,906
things are there like the light that's small - not really it shows

251
00:32:22,946 --> 00:32:30,266
Very well done! It is very lively because the light falls on that, you see,

252
00:32:30,466 --> 00:32:36,486
so it looks very lively. It's beautiful!

253
00:32:39,526 --> 00:32:44,926
- It's a lovely gift when it arrived.
- It was a sheet, sheet of [UNCLEAR] photographs, isn't it Sheryll?

254
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:48,146
- Sure, yes.
- See, what they are.

255
00:32:49,306 --> 00:32:53,626
- She never saw the light herself, did she?
- No.
- No
-

256
00:32:58,446 --> 00:33:03,686
How she took seven of them, it's very surprising - one after - it is guided, I think

257
00:33:04,006 --> 00:33:08,066
[LAUGHTER]

258
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:16,126
It's very well done - beautiful! It's real gold.

259
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:27,726
- It's color of pearls
- And [UNCLEAR] and it's very, very delicate;

260
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,446
See, it's so delicate, it's very delicate thing.

261
00:33:31,906 --> 00:33:35,726
- There is [UNCLEAR] gold, Shri Mataji
- Annh?
- There is [UNCLEAR] gold
- Gold?

262
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:43,786
- [UNCLEAR] gold.
- No, it's real gold. Is 22 carat - it's real gold
- Ah, I see.
- 22 carat.

263
00:33:48,086 --> 00:33:52,206
Not gold plated - it's all gold - yes.

264
00:33:54,606 --> 00:33:59,686
So very cheap, you just can't believe it! How did you like this piece?

265
00:34:00,466 --> 00:34:08,326
It's very good work, hain? This was in Jaipur he picked up. He, you see, he's very lucky, I must say - he's very lucky.

266
00:34:10,246 --> 00:34:17,366
You knew about the saris we went to buy for the Puja - went to the shop and they had it in the bundle.

267
00:34:18,646 --> 00:34:25,086
We asked them, "Have you got any pure zari saris?" "Yes," and eleven of them in a bundle - can you imagine?

268
00:34:25,506 --> 00:34:30,666
I don't know, I could not protest even the way it was done. You see, they took it out

269
00:34:30,926 --> 00:34:36,926
and each sari could cost about six, seven thousand rupees - worth for 1600, so I kept quiet.

270
00:34:37,146 --> 00:34:44,486
I said, "What to do now, what can you say?" Being too much, really; The graciousness is so great.

271
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:48,766
Beautiful these things are!

272
00:34:54,966 --> 00:34:58,586
Now, lots of new photographs have also come with lights and things.

273
00:34:59,686 --> 00:35:03,366
- This is from, from India?
- Yes, this is bought in India.

274
00:35:03,706 --> 00:35:10,186
- [UNCLEAR]
- Which one? No, no, I don't know - from all over, from all over.

275
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:17,506
See the other way, the other side. I'll tell you what - never even touched it and saw it.

276
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:23,286
The beauty of this work is that, you don't get these things normally, you see.

277
00:35:26,686 --> 00:35:29,666
You see the work is on the other side, you see.

278
00:35:37,226 --> 00:35:42,366
- So well finished, you know!
- [UNCLEAR] The back has...

279
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:45,846
-Yes, the back is done with [UNCLEAR]

280
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:06,146
A little bit. I didn't take My [UNCLEAR] there but I did have something on the people had brought for Me.

281
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:19,086
- Bring the table around. It should be..
- Warren, you know who made this? Did you

282
00:36:19,486 --> 00:36:23,766
- No, I don't know
- It's some thing different, isn't it? Is made by a sahaja yogini.

283
00:36:24,046 --> 00:36:27,206
- Really?
- Hmm. [UNCLEAR]

284
00:36:31,646 --> 00:36:36,786
- It's very beautiful [UNCLEAR], Mother.
- I could see that. I just said, "It is not made in -

285
00:36:37,026 --> 00:36:40,446
it's made somewhere here or in..

286
00:36:40,772 --> 00:36:46,557
[Missing part-around 2 minutes]

287
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:53,804
and we went, this time, to see one, in Adelaide again, one exhibition just to see what they're making - absolutely primitive stuff.

288
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:04,364
Surprised - absolutely primitive; Even the dresses were made, as if, you would look like a cave-man or something

289
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:09,384
[UNCLEAR] girl selling cave-girl dresses [UNCLEAR] leather hanging on

290
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:14,384
with a leather, you see - have you seen that sort of a thing - looking so funny.

291
00:37:14,704 --> 00:37:21,484
One lady traveled with us with that kind of a funny dress. Now-a-days, you see, they make this another style, this another style

292
00:37:21,744 --> 00:37:25,964
Only they can do something with their hair, I think, they can't do anything else - so.

293
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:50,384
- New Zealand is famous for potters
- Which one?
- Number of

294
00:37:51,304 --> 00:37:58,004
of potters in this country doing quite enterprising work, quite rather primitive ones slab one

295
00:37:58,244 --> 00:38:04,324
[UNCLEAR] making slabs but there's also another potters doing very delicate work

296
00:38:04,524 --> 00:38:09,844
- Is it?
- Yes, there's one doing

297
00:38:10,784 --> 00:38:16,144
quite creative channel birthday by our

298
00:38:17,524 --> 00:38:24,684
by a potter we have hopes of becoming a sahaja yogi some right [UNCLEAR] since

299
00:38:25,524 --> 00:38:33,144
- Oh, that's fine. Wow, it's Kundalini
- Really?
- Oh, it's done well.

300
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:38,884
That's something, really - it's quite delicate and deep.

301
00:38:40,324 --> 00:38:45,244
- It's beautiful! Just see Warren.
- Yes. Subtle colors
- very good.

302
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:52,624
- Like more tea?
- No, thank you, no, thank you. It's alright. So, that's how it is.

303
00:39:03,084 --> 00:39:08,984
- Who is this one? What's the name of the potter?
- Hainesly, Hainesly Niceon

304
00:39:11,284 --> 00:39:17,444
There're a number of, a number of potters who're working in fine work

305
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:21,504
It should be, it should be, it should be like that.

306
00:39:25,244 --> 00:39:31,624
- We got one gift of fan
- Hmm
- and that had a Ganesh [UNCLEAR]
- Really?

307
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:37,984
Very free flying but very welcome, very beautiful - similar to this in color.

308
00:39:39,604 --> 00:39:42,644
But who's seeing all this in the Unconscious?

309
00:39:43,204 --> 00:39:49,244
[NAME UNCLEAR] She's, she's selling her work now in England and

310
00:39:50,164 --> 00:39:55,844
and what she sells here for 15 and 16 $, sell for 60 and 70

311
00:39:56,184 --> 00:39:59,284
- in, in
- Really? In England?
- hmm

312
00:40:02,784 --> 00:40:06,224
- She can sell as much as she can make.
- Hmm

313
00:40:16,104 --> 00:40:21,584
That everything they are scientifically said, "[UNCLEAR] should be [UNCLEAR] should be [UNCLEAR]."

314
00:40:23,084 --> 00:40:26,584
It is so spontaneous that you cannot write it down exactly.

315
00:40:27,584 --> 00:40:33,184
The color should be such, what is good what is bad. You see, the ideas,

316
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:41,944
which come to you after seeing something, should not be conditioned by somebody else.

317
00:40:45,684 --> 00:40:53,104
Even you cannot appreciate spontaneous art because you're already conditioned - you see through that hole.

318
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:58,504
- Same with music as well
- With music very much.

319
00:40:58,804 --> 00:41:05,824
- Heard somebody, the other day say that, "Within twenty years,  just to open store, would be just too expensive."

320
00:41:06,204 --> 00:41:11,124
and therefore music will uphold a name by electronic means and so on

321
00:41:11,524 --> 00:41:15,564
and they can, even now, make music electronically which

322
00:41:15,904 --> 00:41:20,164
- Warren, why don't you try - it's very good. Try one.

323
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:25,824
We're just realizing that we're two hours ahead and wondering why we're not terribly hungry

324
00:41:26,124 --> 00:41:29,224
- It's actually only six 0'clock out
- Hmm

325
00:41:29,424 --> 00:41:34,824
- So, we'll have dinner at ten, something like that, Mother - is it alright? It's 8:15 now.
- Alright

326
00:41:39,184 --> 00:41:45,544
- Or nine? When would You like?
- Whatever time, I mean, I'm alright with you to have. Warren should be alright.

327
00:41:45,824 --> 00:41:51,464
- Alright, would you like to introduce everybody to Shri Mataji?
- Alright.

328
00:41:51,784 --> 00:41:56,704
- [UNCLEAR - SWATI?]
- Just let them be wherever they have be

329
00:41:59,404 --> 00:42:06,424
- [UNCLEAR - VINAY?] of course You know?
- Of course, I know. I know her. She's doing very well.

330
00:42:07,344 --> 00:42:11,344
- She's growing very well.
- This is [NAME UNCLEAR]

331
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:18,924
- When did she get her realization?
- Two years ago or four

332
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:22,884
- Three years
- Three years ago. She came across to Australia

333
00:42:23,104 --> 00:42:27,924
- I remember meeting her.
- and was there for our [UNCLEAR] and

334
00:42:28,364 --> 00:42:36,004
- started develop her realization there, then came back to New Zealand
- You came from New Zealand to Australia first?

335
00:42:38,024 --> 00:42:44,644
- So, you are a New Zelander.
- Yes. Cheryll's sister - this Cheryll
- [UNCLEAR] your sister, o, oh.

336
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:50,224
They have a mother - different paths.

337
00:42:53,764 --> 00:42:59,644
- Keep a little back
- Aitrow is quite new, in fact. She got her realization earlier this year

338
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:03,204
I see, she's good, she's very good.

339
00:43:03,404 --> 00:43:09,924
- and within a matter of a week or two, she moved into the [UNCLEAR]
- Really?

340
00:43:11,084 --> 00:43:17,204
- so she's starting to, starting to settle into sahaja.
- You are a New Zealander too.
- Yes.

341
00:43:17,444 --> 00:43:20,864
- All your life you've lived here?
- Yes.
- Hmm, good.

342
00:43:21,244 --> 00:43:28,904
That's it. We should get New Zealanders  - is the main point because they are the essences which will then work out. Hmm.

343
00:43:30,684 --> 00:43:38,344
- So, what do you think of your age group people - are they open to sahaja yoga, will they be open?
- [UNCLEAR] they are, Mother, they are - my age group.

344
00:43:38,524 --> 00:43:45,484
I have a feeling that this age group is very different. They are born with  more vision, more compassion

345
00:43:45,764 --> 00:43:50,804
more understanding of a wider world but earlier, naturally, you see, the effects of these

346
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:55,604
people, who came here, were called as Paki haq, as you said -

347
00:43:56,044 --> 00:44:01,524
so they, they had come with other intentions - they couldn't assimilate much of the thing

348
00:44:02,324 --> 00:44:06,724
Such a beautiful place - one should have a feeling.

349
00:44:07,804 --> 00:44:13,644
- Hmm, then?
- [UNCLEAR] this is Wein, who's been

350
00:44:13,924 --> 00:44:19,684
- Wein?
- Wein, who's been coming quite, quite regularly

351
00:44:19,924 --> 00:44:23,744
[UNCLEAR] is good, very [UNCLEAR]

352
00:44:23,984 --> 00:44:27,824
- Wein works in electronics
- Is he?

353
00:44:28,064 --> 00:44:31,504
- So, he's somebody who will help into
- organizing

354
00:44:31,824 --> 00:44:37,524
- [UNCLEAR]
- Ours is also Divine electronics - isn't it?

355
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:43,004
Works the same way - negative, positive.

356
00:44:44,144 --> 00:44:50,724
Jane, as mentioned, is, in fact, an artist. Jane has been to art school, has done

357
00:44:50,944 --> 00:44:57,924
- quite a deal, has exhibitions herself
- Really?
- and she has just recently finished her course at,

358
00:44:58,204 --> 00:45:04,444
at Teacher's Training College and now is established teacher at High School, just near here.

359
00:45:05,364 --> 00:45:12,804
- Support weight and all that - ah, good!
- so she's teaching also the things like art itself and History about itself.

360
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:16,724
- Ah, good!
- She has an exhibition, some little time ago,

361
00:45:16,944 --> 00:45:24,484
- of a [UNCLEAR]. All the pictures were fox [UNCLEAR] pictures of a fox.

362
00:45:25,304 --> 00:45:29,924
They are the most amazing animals also. They can live for days together.

363
00:45:30,304 --> 00:45:38,204
You know, they have lived for years and ages that's when they are found; For ages they have lived - don't know, no one knows their life.

364
00:45:41,924 --> 00:45:49,864
Aitrow, Aitrow is like [NAME UNCLEAR]. She works in a, in a shop, in a boutique, You know.

365
00:45:50,044 --> 00:45:55,544
- Ah! Designing [UNCLEAR]. Designing or selling?

366
00:45:55,784 --> 00:45:58,864
- Selling.
- Selling.
- Hmm.

367
00:45:59,064 --> 00:46:05,684
- [UNCLEAR]
- O,o,oh!
- [UNCLEAR] see locket, inside it - locket

368
00:46:05,884 --> 00:46:12,724
- Hunh?
- Inside the locket, Mother.
- Oh, I see and a frog smiling.

369
00:46:27,604 --> 00:46:34,284
- Last time, I was telling him about a frog in a well
- Last week
- This was [UNCLEAR] came in my mind

370
00:46:35,204 --> 00:46:39,504
Frog in a well. You know the story, frog in a well?

371
00:46:40,204 --> 00:46:45,244
- Yes, it's a Chinese story.
- Haan. It's Indian. There was a frog in a well

372
00:46:46,244 --> 00:46:53,764
and one frog jumped out of the well and told that he saw a very big animal.

373
00:46:54,404 --> 00:46:59,004
So, the frog in a well thought how can there be a bigger animal, bigger than himself because he was such a

374
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:06,544
ego-oriented fellow, you see. So, he said, "How big?" So, he said, "Very big," so he started puffing up

375
00:47:06,884 --> 00:47:14,304
himself; He just pushed some air into his body - just again started, you see, blowing inside and, "He's so big?"

376
00:47:14,484 --> 00:47:22,004
He said, "No, no much bigger," "So big?" went on and on and on till he just burst out

377
00:47:22,204 --> 00:47:27,744
You see, that's the story 'Frog in the Well'

378
00:47:29,864 --> 00:47:37,644
- This is, this is [NAME UNCLEAR - BRYAS?] Shri Mataji.
- Of course, [UNCLEAR - BRYAS?] I know
- He's also an artist, he was also

379
00:47:37,924 --> 00:47:42,984
- All artists here?
- Yes a number of
- He's

380
00:47:43,164 --> 00:47:48,444
- Great artists, annh?
- It's like a Hamsa
- Just see. Alright, put your head down, let's see.

381
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:51,664
- That's it.
- hmm

382
00:47:52,944 --> 00:47:59,524
So, all the artists have must Swadhishthana - right Swadhishthan - that has to happen and one has to work on that.

383
00:48:00,864 --> 00:48:05,384
Good, he's sucking vibrations. Good! Are you feeling?

384
00:48:05,564 --> 00:48:10,464
- He's got [UNCLEAR]...
- It's tremendous, it's tremendous; They're all Saatvikaas - in the center.

385
00:48:11,564 --> 00:48:18,704
- He's with, he's with us in the house as well.
- Is it?
- In your ashram he is
- Is he? All good.

386
00:48:19,824 --> 00:48:25,064
- So what do you paint?
- Portraits.
- Portraits, hmm.

387
00:48:25,264 --> 00:48:33,084
- Is that your profession or do you do another job too?
- I [UNCLEAR]
- That's good

388
00:48:35,344 --> 00:48:39,184
There are people here who appreciate art here in this country?

389
00:48:40,024 --> 00:48:46,524
Yes, regularly held exhibitions. A number of exhibition buildings in the city which have regular,

390
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:54,464
regularly display exhibitions - painting, photograph, pottery, wood carvings

391
00:48:55,184 --> 00:49:00,824
- and also ordinary interesting things - enamel works and so on.
- Enamel? [UNCLEAR]

392
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:09,944
But I think, in certain thing India is really - look at this piece that they have made also - this kind

393
00:49:10,604 --> 00:49:15,804
I don't think, we can do it here. You see, retail working

394
00:49:16,384 --> 00:49:23,044
Certain things we are still very good and these things can be taught to the artists there in India - that's My idea is.

395
00:49:23,384 --> 00:49:30,764
and you can teach them some things that; Like, I saw one thing was good, very good was, what you call,

396
00:49:31,624 --> 00:49:38,664
- etching -
- Etching?
- etching, that I have not seen in India; People don't do that. Also this pottery painting

397
00:49:42,004 --> 00:49:47,664
Indian art is fantastic but it is not so realistic like, your portraits are realistic and

398
00:49:48,104 --> 00:49:55,424
also other things, other styles are not there - impression is taken all the styles are not very much known to them.

399
00:49:56,144 --> 00:50:04,004
Is it very sharp difference, isn't it Shri Mataji, between the Indian, Indian painting which it sets out to

400
00:50:04,864 --> 00:50:12,504
to represent the figure in it's perfect form which seems to be in the paintings [UNCLEAR] of the Deities and so

401
00:50:12,704 --> 00:50:16,484
- that the job of the painter is not to express himself
- hunn

402
00:50:16,704 --> 00:50:20,104
- but to be himself talented
- He doesn't even write his name, you know, doesn't even

403
00:50:20,364 --> 00:50:28,164
that's not there. He doesn't want to express himself; He is trying to, I don't know, he's trying to express the Creator

404
00:50:28,644 --> 00:50:36,084
in his things, you see, that's why it's very different and if you see even the paintings, I gave you, these ordinary ones

405
00:50:37,364 --> 00:50:43,324
from Bihar - see every line is done with a

406
00:50:43,504 --> 00:50:50,084
very dainty, I mean delicate, pen - we cannot rub it off, you see

407
00:50:50,344 --> 00:50:57,344
every line is drawn, is drawn now - it's not rubbed off and they don't have any other tracing done or anything - just free hand

408
00:50:57,924 --> 00:51:03,764
and imagine, how many lines they do and this - no problem at all, I mean, nothing is destroyed,

409
00:51:03,964 --> 00:51:08,044
nothing is rubbed off - it's just the same they make at a stretch.

410
00:51:10,884 --> 00:51:18,264
So one thing is, concentration is good and their deftness and the fingers are very steady, you see, shows their nerves very steady.

411
00:51:18,544 --> 00:51:24,944
Is they're peaceful people that's why they can do it. And also I saw this miniature painting - I haven't brought any

412
00:51:25,404 --> 00:51:30,204
to show you but I wish I'd brought to show you; Miniature paintings are so delicate, so delicate

413
00:51:30,544 --> 00:51:34,124
little, little things done so delicately with such artistry.

414
00:51:35,204 --> 00:51:42,544
I don't know how they do it in the villages - just done for no price at all. What about the present? Better get it.

415
00:51:44,304 --> 00:51:51,944
- We got a present for them.
- Oh, that one, yes. It's nice and early to give it -  now that's good.

416
00:51:52,284 --> 00:51:57,604
- [UNCLEAR] Adelaide [UNCLEAR]
- Yes, I know but I enquired if you have it or not.

417
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:11,204
But for them art is not money, art is not anything else but enjoyment, just enjoyment, so they just indulge into it

418
00:52:11,464 --> 00:52:16,924
and they make a perfect job. Now see, this sari of Mine is, I must show you

419
00:52:17,144 --> 00:52:22,444
because I didn't realize it was so [UNCLEAR] it's all woven with hand - see

420
00:52:25,884 --> 00:52:33,604
See the details that are done - elephant and everything is all woven. What I'm saying, it's all done with hand all woven.

421
00:52:34,864 --> 00:52:39,424
So simple it is for them to - every bit of it, you see, so delicate;

422
00:52:41,344 --> 00:52:44,424
This is fine arts, absolutely fine arts.

423
00:52:46,524 --> 00:52:52,044
[UNCLEAR] had a famous [UNCLEAR]

424
00:52:52,364 --> 00:52:55,604
Yeah, this is Mahakali, Mahalaxmi, Mahasaraswati - They are

425
00:52:56,804 --> 00:53:03,864
No, it is Shri Krishna, I'm sorry. This is Shri Krishna and these are the gopis dancing - this is what they have shown - see

426
00:53:04,104 --> 00:53:08,904
- Just hold it up to the camera.
- What's this?

427
00:53:21,504 --> 00:53:26,444
See now. [UNCLEAR] craft. You just sit down and do it.

428
00:53:28,184 --> 00:53:36,204
But not one line you'll find is, sort of, wrong or anything is rubbed off - nothing; Just they take the paper, start doing it.

429
00:53:37,244 --> 00:53:44,464
There they're. The theme and everything is so spontaneous - just like somebody is sitting down and singing to you - it's like that.

430
00:53:59,784 --> 00:54:05,764
This time I couldn't get any - I was so disappointed. I said, "What's happening to this, why I didn't get anything?" I mean,

431
00:54:05,904 --> 00:54:13,684
normally I get about 100-200. Last time I got about 150. This time didn't get any; I went to Patna for that purpose.

432
00:54:15,004 --> 00:54:20,424
I hope next time I'll be able to get some. So, that's it.

433
00:54:29,064 --> 00:54:35,904
You see, he didn't give you the 'raas' - it gave all of them like this, I don't know why. I see them all of them on this there.

434
00:54:36,544 --> 00:54:43,244
- Just two, Mother, these... these two of this and then two [UNCLEAR]
- You see, the theme is

435
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:51,444
that they see Krishna everywhere, you see, standing with everyone and they're wondering what is this. you see, like this the expression is.

436
00:54:52,184 --> 00:54:55,944
It's just a village craft, absolutely and also His

437
00:54:57,104 --> 00:55:03,124
- stories about Him how He killed and what He did and
- Always little bit miniature ones.
- Haan, miniature ones - yes.

438
00:55:04,324 --> 00:55:07,364
See the shades and things they've done.

439
00:55:09,484 --> 00:55:15,304
- Berry, you've got a big enough wall?
- [UNCLEAR] yes
- There you can put it, yeah.

440
00:55:15,644 --> 00:55:18,704
You see the fineness of the work!

441
00:55:27,784 --> 00:55:34,224
- That's from your big brother.
- Ah! It's beautiful
- Such a lot of work, I tell you, such a lot of work.

442
00:55:37,564 --> 00:55:40,664
and this cloth looks like silk when they have done it.

443
00:55:46,484 --> 00:55:49,684
All His life stories on the sides they have done.

444
00:55:56,664 --> 00:56:00,864
God knows what sort of colors they are using - some sort of indigenous colors.

445
00:56:02,584 --> 00:56:10,044
Is there anything with the - this would be better for - same style; They're all the same style - yeah.

446
00:56:12,584 --> 00:56:17,304
- There's about little different here and there.
- There's a difference there.
- Hmm.

447
00:56:19,404 --> 00:56:25,124
- But the Raas is not there.
- There's a little Raas in the photograph. I will show You.

448
00:56:25,464 --> 00:56:31,224
but that Raas one he didn't give us. Perhaps, you told him we don't want the

449
00:56:33,064 --> 00:56:40,564
- See it's just there.
- It's giving very inside there, somewhere. If not, it's alright. [UNCLEAR] but one has to be careful.

450
00:56:41,184 --> 00:56:47,384
- I know it's just the fall
- Yes, there's a difference - see. There's one house here and house there - there's no house there.

451
00:56:47,744 --> 00:56:55,324
- Only the Raas is there.
- Raas is different style, you see, it's different.
- This is another one. [UNCLEAR]

452
00:56:55,804 --> 00:57:03,204
- Whichever you like. I think, this is, this would be better for New Zealand.
- Alright. I think, they can get this for [UNCLEAR]

453
00:57:07,664 --> 00:57:12,784
- And all their details.
- It's nice, annh?
- Beautiful!

454
00:57:13,424 --> 00:57:18,244
- Like it? It's very beautiful art.
- Whichever one you want is yours.

455
00:57:20,424 --> 00:57:27,164
And this one is better. I find  that one it's more with the house and all that.

456
00:57:32,684 --> 00:57:39,044
See there are stories around, are there [UNCLEAR] and the ladies also. Here there are no - there are cows here.

457
00:57:44,604 --> 00:57:48,364
- It's quite interesting too.
- Everything is, no doubt.

458
00:57:53,684 --> 00:58:01,384
- But there are so many ladies.
- [UNCLEAR] beautiful!
- Can I have My spectacles from there?

459
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:15,264
- They look national
- What is that national?
- This site, national site

460
00:58:15,724 --> 00:58:20,864
- Is this is the one for New Zealand?
- What is national - where?

461
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:27,104
You see it. It is one of the eleven, what we call,

462
00:58:28,684 --> 00:58:32,664
Oh, this one now. When are they going to give back one, alright?

463
00:58:33,104 --> 00:58:37,044
Now, you've already got this one - it's too much.

464
00:58:38,804 --> 00:58:44,044
- This is [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah, national work. So, there was no need for you to buy

465
00:58:44,404 --> 00:58:51,524
He bought it for Australia; This is out of the blue. This is out of the blue.

466
00:58:52,784 --> 00:58:59,804
[UNCLEAR] work and kept in a pyjama - that's the best part of it.

467
00:59:02,344 --> 00:59:08,184
What a nice one it is - beautiful! But this you get next year - now not this year.

468
00:59:08,484 --> 00:59:13,464
- Hmm?
- This will be next year now.
- Can I have a glimpse at it, Mother?
- Alright, let them have.

469
00:59:17,784 --> 00:59:22,884
you have no puja here - are we going to have any puja as such? Then you can

470
00:59:24,624 --> 00:59:31,324
You see, every nationality has to have one sari, so like that they have given eleven saris; It's a very beautiful piece, no doubt.

471
00:59:32,864 --> 00:59:36,444
May God bless you! Just see that - see the workmanship.

472
00:59:40,004 --> 00:59:45,424
So, he included you, you see, in buying that, this is his he included you in one of the centers.

473
00:59:45,644 --> 00:59:53,624
- This is your program sari, I've called it.
- huh
- This is your country sari
- National, yes, national sari because you are a nation - isn't it?

474
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:58,484
- Isn't it? See the workmanship.
- This is a gift from me, alright,
- Alright.

475
00:59:58,664 --> 01:00:03,744
To you people but this is the one you bought for the birthday.

476
01:00:04,284 --> 01:00:10,684
[UNCLEAR] When you bought this national, why have one more?

477
01:00:12,104 --> 01:00:19,124
- So, this is the one we keep for when we have a puja?
- Yes
- It's a beauty [UNCLEAR]
- Are you having a puja here?

478
01:00:19,464 --> 01:00:24,524
- I haven't planned Mother, I haven't planned, Mother, at all
- Better have a puja there, if possible.

479
01:00:25,304 --> 01:00:30,664
- They have a little one today.
- That's all? You keep it for next year, alright?

480
01:00:30,924 --> 01:00:35,804
- When you've got a hundred sahaja yogis
- [UNCLEAR]
- Keep it for next year.

481
01:00:39,144 --> 01:00:43,624
This is a very nice one. This is another miracle - tell them about it.

482
01:00:43,864 --> 01:00:50,344
- This is a London - we got, we found this in London.
- Can you imagine, for half the price?

483
01:00:52,124 --> 01:00:58,424
Now You know why, Mother, I decided they have an extra twelfth sari for Australia because there has to be one for New Zealand.

484
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:06,244
- You had to? I didn't follow still.
- You know that lovely green one that we bought for You first day

485
01:01:06,524 --> 01:01:10,464
- Yes
- I was looking for an excuse to get one more sari
- hunh

486
01:01:10,824 --> 01:01:18,004
- and New Zealand didn't have a national sari, so they had to
- I see, so next year when they have the puja we'll have it - alright?

487
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,464
for New Zealand, so keep it then with you.

488
01:01:25,764 --> 01:01:32,424
- Keep it nicely wrapped up
- Warren has his ideas
- That's [UNCLEAR] trousers

489
01:01:32,624 --> 01:01:38,844
[LAUGHTER] He loves to [UNCLEAR] with the dhobi - so he wrapped up

490
01:01:40,644 --> 01:01:47,804
- I was, I don't know whether it was [UNCLEAR]
- I don't know what's the thing in bottle stuff, you see.

491
01:01:48,284 --> 01:01:55,704
Brandy [LAUGHTER] I'm not guilty.

492
01:01:58,184 --> 01:02:04,824
- It's a very beautiful thing. You turn around and see the workmanship on the other side.
- Have a look at the palla.
- The palla is so beautiful.

493
01:02:05,804 --> 01:02:11,044
So that you see the proper text and put it in relation to the other part.

494
01:02:12,544 --> 01:02:19,884
- It's all hand woven and that is pure gold, gold thread.
- How much did you pay for it - 700

495
01:02:20,164 --> 01:02:23,564
- Fifty-one pounds
- Fifty-one pounds - can you imagine?

496
01:02:24,204 --> 01:02:29,764
- That's now fifty one dollars
- Everything - no, no everything inclusive, all, everything inclusive.

497
01:02:31,384 --> 01:02:36,364
Everything inclusive - even the sari and petticoat, everything. Can you imagine?

498
01:02:42,524 --> 01:02:48,264
See the workmanship; This is what I am saying. This, what you have to learn when you come to India.

499
01:02:48,504 --> 01:02:54,264
Isn't it - that's a something, that weaving that you don't do here - you can't.

500
01:02:56,144 --> 01:03:00,724
And a little lace like that also will really change the whole pattern, like

501
01:03:01,004 --> 01:03:06,624
your black, this thing, dress, if you can put a little bit of gold in that, will look nice - isn't it, something..

502
01:03:11,164 --> 01:03:17,824
But we are, we are, you see, like you people only make koala bear, you also make only elephants, you see, like that.

503
01:03:18,184 --> 01:03:23,104
In India, whatever you may try, they'll have elephants, elephants, elephants

504
01:03:23,384 --> 01:03:28,904
and this also patterns, whatever are there, they do not change, they keep the same.

505
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:34,764
If you tell them, why not just make borders, just make cloth without borders - they cannot.

506
01:03:36,264 --> 01:03:39,584
It's a very, you see, blinkers there are.

507
01:03:47,644 --> 01:03:53,964
- Nice.
- This is some with this hand painting. They stretch it on a stretcher with a back in

508
01:03:55,284 --> 01:04:02,264
and put it plus gold frame and all, super plain gold frame and all that's nice; We've seen them stretch

509
01:04:02,504 --> 01:04:10,004
You see, they have done one thing good is to put something, a very transparent plastic thing on top, you see, so it doesn't get spoilt.

510
01:04:12,024 --> 01:04:15,344
- You didn't see that?
- Where was that, Mother?
- It was in Perth.

511
01:04:15,684 --> 01:04:23,604
- Oh, really?
- Hmm. I asked them how is it kept so well
- You mean, spray or a sheet?
- No, a sheet. Absolutely a very, very thin sheet, you see

512
01:04:24,064 --> 01:04:28,244
- Tied [UNCLEAR] it?
- No, no, no, no - just on the cloth
- Just on top
- Yes.

513
01:04:29,544 --> 01:04:37,504
Just like when you are framing this, with that they frame that, so it keeps very... because this is after all cloth, you see, it catches some dirt

514
01:04:38,004 --> 01:04:45,324
- but here there's no question.
- There is also a spray you can use on the now, Mother, which has the same effect

515
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:52,164
- It repels all the dust and it protects the actual fabric.
- [UNCLEAR] saw it there - that will protect the cloth also.

516
01:04:55,164 --> 01:05:00,124
Shri Mataji, would You like to just quietly spend some time?

517
01:05:00,304 --> 01:05:05,564
- Oh, I
- Just introduce the other people, Brian  and before dinner Mother would just be at ease.

518
01:05:06,024 --> 01:05:11,564
- Peter You know from
- You know Peter, Mother?
- Of course.

519
01:05:14,004 --> 01:05:22,064
- Since how long has he been with you?
- Not sure.
- Since last few days
- Last few days.

520
01:05:23,924 --> 01:05:29,224
Australians have wonderful vibrations, I tell you - New Zealand and Australians also - Tremendous!

521
01:05:29,584 --> 01:05:36,104
You can't find this with Americans; They think no end of themselves though. May God bless you!

522
01:05:39,044 --> 01:05:45,124
- It's very good.
- Elizabeth is
- Peter's the one who has the health food chocolates, Sydney

523
01:05:45,784 --> 01:05:52,504
- Oh
- and has certain propositions for sahaja yoga on those lines.
- Achcha, good.

524
01:05:52,944 --> 01:06:00,584
- This is Elizabeth, Mother, who's been coming for the last few weeks.
- How are you Elizabeth - let's see?

525
01:06:03,064 --> 01:06:07,944
Good, good! May God bless you! It's good

526
01:06:08,304 --> 01:06:13,924
- and [UNCLEAR] Robert
- Hello!
- Now
- Unnh

527
01:06:16,484 --> 01:06:20,204
- Like me substantial
- Is he Greek?
-
-

528
01:06:23,124 --> 01:06:26,164
Good!

529
01:06:27,944 --> 01:06:31,584
[UNCLEAR] good, excellent!

530
01:06:32,804 --> 01:06:37,404
- Are you Greek?
- No, no Irish.
- Irish, I see.

531
01:06:37,844 --> 01:06:46,004
- Looks like a Greek.
- [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]
- Annh?
- [UNCLEAR].

532
01:06:46,304 --> 01:06:50,764
- Thank you.
- But
- Irish could be Greek, you see, possibly because

533
01:06:50,964 --> 01:06:54,724
so many Greeks spread that way - Irish, I mean, it's not pure Irish.

534
01:06:56,204 --> 01:07:03,504
- But that Robert and Elizabeth have been involved with Mahikari.
- Beg your pardon?
- But Robert and Elizabeth have been involved with Mahikari.

535
01:07:04,204 --> 01:07:08,164
Haan, that's another problem.

536
01:07:11,564 --> 01:07:17,244
But it has happened with everyone, I tell you. All those who have been even incarnations.

537
01:07:17,764 --> 01:07:23,804
Think of Christ - I mean, you cannot say Christ was not true but his disciples are like this.

538
01:07:24,244 --> 01:07:31,624
See, all those great people, who came on this earth, when their disciples came in, they were like that, so you can't blame anyone.

539
01:07:31,844 --> 01:07:38,564
- Actually, it was the daughter of this
- Huh, she
- she interrupted. He, he was a realized soul.
- He was realized

540
01:07:39,444 --> 01:07:45,244
- But also he was just realized, he was just realized.
- Sukyo Nisama was a realized soul

541
01:07:45,464 --> 01:07:52,264
but [UNCLEAR], his daughter was absolutely not a realized soul and she was manipulated by the money-makers and the organisation.

542
01:07:53,204 --> 01:07:58,684
That's very common, I tell you, very, very common that a person who's of a

543
01:07:59,124 --> 01:08:04,204
very great value comes on this earth, does nice good work and then suddenly,

544
01:08:04,444 --> 01:08:07,864
son or maybe the disciple, they spoil it.

545
01:08:09,764 --> 01:08:16,284
Maybe You're saying that of the year of the originator of the Church in Houston, what You're talking about

546
01:08:17,124 --> 01:08:22,364
- I said that
- He went to church there - he was a realized soul but think his followers

547
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:29,424
- Oh, no not, no, no
- Not [UNCLEAR] the one who started the church
- The one who started the church
- Yes, he was

548
01:08:29,744 --> 01:08:35,524
but this Sid is, you see is, I don't know what he's doing, I mean, they've compromised

549
01:08:35,764 --> 01:08:43,024
Yes, you see, they want to adjust themselves to unity, unity as funny people.

550
01:08:43,904 --> 01:08:51,044
They were supporting Rajneesh - now they don't know what to do with him because they were supporting Rajneesh - now Rajneesh has been found out to be a crook

551
01:08:51,664 --> 01:08:58,144
All the Rajneesh people have now gathered near him there and they were forced to come there

552
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:05,764
and it was said that, "You all come along and then, now the whole world is going to end up, so we'll all look after," stupid people went there

553
01:09:06,484 --> 01:09:11,764
They sold all their things, assets and all that and everything was given there in Rajneesh's ashram

554
01:09:12,024 --> 01:09:17,184
and some of them were paid also money for these people to go there those who didn't have money

555
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:21,504
but now they are working there like hard labor for them -

556
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:26,004
they're doing all their farming, this, that and even if they want to come out, they cannot.

557
01:09:27,464 --> 01:09:32,684
So, they informed the government and then these people have got now guns and everything and

558
01:09:32,964 --> 01:09:38,804
they said that, "Anybody tries to come inside, then we'll shoot off these people," so they are in a mess there.

559
01:09:42,584 --> 01:09:47,884
Eric is a seeker from way back, Shri Mataji. He's been through

560
01:09:48,144 --> 01:09:53,304
a lot of the powers on the ways - this Eric.

561
01:09:57,864 --> 01:10:02,984
Hmm, that why the void is, left side - it's very simple. You can cure it.

562
01:10:04,064 --> 01:10:10,924
I mean, if you are a seeker, you just go out from everything that is being done - forget it, it's finished.

563
01:10:12,284 --> 01:10:17,544
Because, you see, they appear to be very sensible sometimes, I don't know what they appear to be

564
01:10:19,324 --> 01:10:25,344
but in America, you know, they asked Me, "How many Rolls Royces She has?" Stupid people.

565
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:28,924
And when they told them, She doesn't take any money, how will She have Rolls Royces?

566
01:10:29,164 --> 01:10:34,444
- So they said, "We're not interested in the person who has no Rolls Royces, who doesn't make money."
- That was the Press.

567
01:10:34,704 --> 01:10:40,304
- And even a person who came to see Me in London, what was his name?
- Oh yes, the B.B.C. man.
- Haan, B.B.C. man

568
01:10:40,704 --> 01:10:46,864
He said, "How can it be that You don't take any money then, you see, the Anglo- Saxon brain cannot understand it."

569
01:10:47,064 --> 01:10:54,124
- Anglo- Saxon brain is which, made of what?
- [LAUGHTER]
- It's the first question I asked here by the Press.

570
01:10:54,324 --> 01:10:58,764
"How much do you pay, how much do you pay?" First question, first, first question.

571
01:10:58,924 --> 01:11:06,784
- Meaning that they should pay?
- No, no meaning that they want to know the price that this lady, who I am trying to

572
01:11:06,984 --> 01:11:11,404
interest them in, how much she charges us

573
01:11:11,604 --> 01:11:16,744
- What are the damages?
- Yeah [LAUGHTER] that's always the first question, always.

574
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:20,944
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

575
01:11:21,324 --> 01:11:27,644
- Peter is, Shri Mataji, Peter is in broadcasting as well. He's a
- Is he?

576
01:11:27,884 --> 01:11:33,904
- He's a Assistant Director
- Oh I see [UNCLEAR] broadcasting [UNCLEAR]
- Yes
- Good

577
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:42,264
- They're talking of BBC and here it is
- He has asthma.
- Hmm

578
01:11:44,284 --> 01:11:52,124
That we'll cure. Hold your breath thrice - for a while, for a while - not for long.

579
01:11:54,784 --> 01:12:01,664
Thrice. [UNCLEAR] there

580
01:12:07,164 --> 01:12:10,244
May God bless you!

581
01:12:13,284 --> 01:12:19,464
They cannot understand some body who could be just [UNCLEAR] can't understand, can't.

582
01:12:20,024 --> 01:12:27,424
Here I'm fighting this fellow, "Don't buy this I'm feeling shy, then I'll have to make amends, I'll have to buy things to give them presents -

583
01:12:27,604 --> 01:12:32,904
don't buy." They can't understand such a person - that's the trouble is.

584
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:42,984
They just can't understand - beyond them. I don't know how they understand Christ.

585
01:12:45,164 --> 01:12:49,004
- [UNCLEAR]
- They don't.

586
01:12:49,324 --> 01:12:53,804
- What do they say about His
- I mean, they've all missed the point - haven't they?

587
01:12:58,964 --> 01:13:05,284
Such [UNCLEAR] like this fellow, your

588
01:13:06,544 --> 01:13:10,144
Archbishop of Canterbury - did I tell you about Him?

589
01:13:10,904 --> 01:13:16,424
He was asked by Robin Day, you see, Robin Day you know what Robin Day is. My granddaughter says,

590
01:13:16,704 --> 01:13:23,124
"He must have been a bull dog in his last life, you see." This Robin Day asking him a question

591
01:13:23,324 --> 01:13:30,584
- A very aggressive English individual.
- I know - very bluntly asking a question, "Ah! Then what do you think of Holy Ghost?"

592
01:13:31,464 --> 01:13:37,464
So Archbishop says, "I'm agnostic." He said, "Then what are you doing here?" Said, "I'm doing my job."

593
01:13:37,704 --> 01:13:44,344
Said, "Yes, yes. You're doing your job, I'm doing my job." [LAUGHTER] Finished. Mutual understanding.

594
01:13:44,584 --> 01:13:52,264
Probably, they were right because you're doing your job, I'm doing my job - paid for it - finished. "Yeah, I'm agnostic."

595
01:13:53,644 --> 01:14:00,424
I, you know My eyes popped off - C P was there - he took out his spectacles, he couldn't understand - then he put it.

596
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:05,084
He said, "Archbishop?" I said, "Yes, this is the one." [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

597
01:14:06,524 --> 01:14:12,084
- This is [UNCLEAR] Shri Mataji. [UNCLEAR] who acts in the same shop as [UNCLEAR]
- Hun huh

598
01:14:12,284 --> 01:14:20,064
and had many a comforts inside in the dressing room doing spare time about what sahaja is all about.

599
01:14:21,264 --> 01:14:26,844
- All those, that I work with, had their realization and they're all coming along to the program.
- Good.

600
01:14:27,864 --> 01:14:31,544
Yes. May God bless you!

601
01:14:33,504 --> 01:14:39,764
- You make cotton dresses here, you sell?
- It's all cotton, no polyester.
- No polyester - that's good.

602
01:14:40,164 --> 01:14:44,724
- Good
- You see, I was telling him that, "You must be getting some cotton here after all."

603
01:14:45,444 --> 01:14:51,524
So he said - then somebody told Me, "They make cotton here in Australia."

604
01:14:52,924 --> 01:14:56,124
Australian cotton you have.

605
01:14:58,044 --> 01:15:05,004
Because no use having polyester. If not cotton, have silk but polyester is no good.

606
01:15:07,204 --> 01:15:12,044
Outside clothes may be that some of you have sweaters and things

607
01:15:12,864 --> 01:15:19,304
but I just can't, I mean, I can't wear it. I get funny feeling inside here.

608
01:15:22,444 --> 01:15:29,184
But how will people manage because they are used to these things and so many clothes, you see, one lady wants to have;

609
01:15:30,164 --> 01:15:34,704
So many clothes then how can she have cotton? Cotton must be expensive here.

610
01:15:35,024 --> 01:15:42,784
[UNCLEAR] polyester [UNCLEAR]

611
01:15:43,024 --> 01:15:49,804
[UNCLEAR] all these ladies come in and love, You know, [UNCLEAR]

612
01:15:51,044 --> 01:15:56,964
- This summer has been a lot of cotton, a lot of cotton ball.
- Is it?
- Pure cotton - a lot of

613
01:15:57,304 --> 01:16:01,704
Truly think is that it is the best expensive and the plastics are the least expensive.

614
01:16:02,044 --> 01:16:08,344
But in India the other way round. You see, polyester is, at least, four times more expensive than cotton, you see.

615
01:16:09,104 --> 01:16:17,144
- Silk is half the price of polyester. You know that, Warren?
 - Five times more expensive than stainless steel.

616
01:16:17,604 --> 01:16:24,164
Yeah, but now stainless steel, I must say, stainless steel is now very cheap in India but very expensive in Australia.

617
01:16:24,444 --> 01:16:30,424
- We went to the shop, I must tell you this one. Now that, let's meet all of you, then I'll tell you about it.
- Cha Cha

618
01:16:33,344 --> 01:16:39,164
- She must have been coming at the last [UNCLEAR]
- Put your hands under My feet - alright?

619
01:16:39,724 --> 01:16:42,744
They are all very good, I must say.

620
01:16:45,084 --> 01:16:52,304
- Excellent!
- He's a hard working seeker.
- Annh?
- A hard working seeker.

621
01:16:57,684 --> 01:17:01,544
- May God bless you! Alright?
- I think, that's everybody.

622
01:17:02,404 --> 01:17:10,484
- Oh, who's she?
- Come I'll [UNCLEAR] That's Ericsson. That's everybody - should be.

623
01:17:12,364 --> 01:17:19,724
- So we..
- You may have a rest.
- What's that? Now be done. Everything you've given me
- Just another little present, another little one.

624
01:17:20,884 --> 01:17:27,184
- It's particularly about New Zealand. It's some pictures of New Zealand, really.
- Hmm, thank you very much.

625
01:17:27,824 --> 01:17:35,544
- Thank you very much, thank you. Can I open it?
- Yes. [UNCLEAR]

626
01:17:40,044 --> 01:17:46,124
- That seems to be [UNCLEAR]
- You see, this I knew - Sarva Granthi Vibhedini

627
01:17:46,744 --> 01:17:52,084
[LAUGHTER] Granthi, I know.

628
01:17:57,204 --> 01:18:04,964
Now .... but the sticking things I don't know.

629
01:18:07,124 --> 01:18:10,704
- Knots You can do but not sticky things.
- Yes.

630
01:18:12,044 --> 01:18:17,884
[UNCLEAR] this has been packed very well, so.

631
01:18:19,864 --> 01:18:25,984
- So they kept the flowers back?
- Yes, they have. They said that they have [UNCLEAR]

632
01:18:26,564 --> 01:18:34,504
- All humbug. They wanted to have the flowers themselves.
- Humbug
- Absolutely.

633
01:18:44,144 --> 01:18:47,124
[UNCLEAR]

634
01:18:51,564 --> 01:18:57,524
- New Zeal Land
- Land of new zeal.
- New zeal

635
01:18:59,584 --> 01:19:05,004
Land of many dreams - but the dreams have to come true.

636
01:19:06,824 --> 01:19:14,804
This color scheme is nice. I must, you must see - Rommel's book has come out very well; You'll be happy to see his progress.

637
01:19:15,344 --> 01:19:21,184
- It's in the smaller case - if you can bring My...
- O, You've got a copy here.
- Yes, I have.

638
01:19:21,404 --> 01:19:27,384
- Is it in the top part or bottom part, Mother?
- I think, top part.

639
01:19:32,104 --> 01:19:38,964
South Island in the country is nearly down in the West coast, which is a very famous tourist area

640
01:19:39,184 --> 01:19:46,904
It's a field land like in, in Norway - very steep sided mountains going right out very deep

641
01:19:47,144 --> 01:19:52,464
- I see.
- The sea comes right after the valleys into the

642
01:19:52,804 --> 01:19:56,244
- huh
- under a very tall mountains.

643
01:19:59,344 --> 01:20:07,144
- [UNCLEAR] my glasses are sitting there just there on ..
- No, it's alright. It's beautiful! See the colors.

644
01:20:08,044 --> 01:20:11,184
Naturally they are so beautiful.

645
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:16,704
This is, this is North of Auckland.

646
01:20:24,984 --> 01:20:32,444
- There's a lot of bush
- I saw a painting like this on, in the airport.

647
01:20:32,884 --> 01:20:40,484
- swimming - yes
- This is the sort of forest that this wood is grown, Shri Mataji. This is, this is Kauri - one of the, one of the

648
01:20:40,584 --> 01:20:46,964
- What is it called?
- Kauri - k-a-u-r-i Kauri
- Kauri
- and it's one of the most famous of the New Zealand

649
01:20:47,184 --> 01:20:54,304
- What is the fruit like?
- I don't know, I don't know what
- Pine cone
- Pine, it's Pine cones

650
01:20:55,004 --> 01:20:59,964
- Pine - is it Pine? Like the Pine cones
- It's more curled
- Huh huh

651
01:21:00,724 --> 01:21:06,664
- because we call kauri as something else that's why I wanted to know.
- There's also an Australian tree called a Kauri
-
-

652
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:14,444
- which is, but that is, that's quite a different tree
- What are these lines?
- they got the time exposure let the camera run while all the traffic is run through

653
01:21:14,684 --> 01:21:20,384
- so that these lights have
- [UNCLEAR - ARE ON THE?]
- been printed on the, on the negative.

654
01:21:21,464 --> 01:21:27,264
- It's like the camera's been opened for ten seconds or fifteen seconds
- So what is this is?
- They're cars

655
01:21:27,444 --> 01:21:32,144
- they're the lights of cars that are traffic. Here the lights of the car coming forth.

656
01:21:32,484 --> 01:21:39,544
Because you see in one of My, two of My photographs they've got things like that travelling, going, shooting off like that

657
01:21:40,084 --> 01:21:46,184
- lights
- That's rather different type of
- That's what I was
- that's a different sort of light

658
01:21:47,104 --> 01:21:54,364
- That must be with the same kind of a
- That's the Auckland bridge, here.

659
01:21:56,564 --> 01:22:01,444
I put them it wasn't wide enough. Since I built it, it wasn't big enough, so I built

660
01:22:01,604 --> 01:22:06,444
two sections on either side and the Japanese - they employed Japanese firm

661
01:22:06,764 --> 01:22:12,764
to, to put these extra pieces on the side of the bridge and they called them the nipons flipons.

662
01:22:16,984 --> 01:22:21,764
- Beautiful!
- This is [UNCLEAR] offices; This is near where we are.
- Hmm

663
01:22:22,184 --> 01:22:29,784
- This is the [INAUDIBLE]
- This is Chinese style
- Hmm

664
01:22:32,464 --> 01:22:38,384
- Color schemes are beautiful, beautiful!
- That's the Bay of Islands.That is the most beautiful part of this country

665
01:22:40,564 --> 01:22:47,444
- lush and lovely!
- Hmm
- This is another famous tourist area - Red Rove, where there are [UNCLEAR]
-

666
01:22:48,064 --> 01:22:55,044
and bowling mud pools and so on. The volcano, the volcanic is very near to the surface.

667
01:22:57,284 --> 01:23:03,144
- Hawk water pool it's called
- [UNCLEAR]
- That's also in Red Rove near

668
01:23:03,544 --> 01:23:09,604
In Japan also you have lots of things like that. Every 28 minutes in a plain city a spout

669
01:23:09,804 --> 01:23:16,584
- of thing comes out - every 28 minutes.
- [UNCLEAR] saying there like they have
-

670
01:23:17,004 --> 01:23:23,484
- but the timing is so correct - it's beautiful! It's quite old?
- That's Rotoroa again.

671
01:23:24,064 --> 01:23:30,704
- What style it is?
- Quda. That King had too many wives

672
01:23:31,424 --> 01:23:37,984
- Here
- That's his style of building. It was from that period but of course it's much more - mop.
- This is the church?

673
01:23:38,224 --> 01:23:45,004
- No, I say it's a
- It's a residence
- it's a place for people to go to a spa, You know, to
- Hmm

674
01:23:45,244 --> 01:23:52,344
- take the waters and there's a from a distance of quality to these, to these boiling mud-pools

675
01:23:52,984 --> 01:24:00,824
- these
- Oh, I see
- people got to take the waters into. Just swim in the hot waters and swim
- See the nature!

676
01:24:03,144 --> 01:24:09,684
- Tremendous this is!
- All of Rotoroa is like this with every backyard

677
01:24:09,924 --> 01:24:17,604
- this is little jets of hot steam
- Yeah, where?
- In this town of Rotoroa - in this, right in the center of the island - in the middle of the North Island.

678
01:24:19,564 --> 01:24:23,884
We're sitting on top of a volcano [UNCLEAR]?

679
01:24:24,244 --> 01:24:31,424
Like everybody, they say, that when the spurts of steam stop, then you get worried.

680
01:24:32,224 --> 01:24:37,644
- because as long as the steam is coming up, then probably there's a slighter
- There's an outlet
- it's nothing.

681
01:24:38,084 --> 01:24:44,144
- It's like, I think, this, this looks to Me like Japan, you see,
- What?
- New Zealand same on

682
01:24:44,624 --> 01:24:51,504
- altitudes
- but it's all, all part of the great circle of geological circle

683
01:24:51,724 --> 01:24:57,024
round the Pacific. It goes up through the Andes, up through the Nawadas, up to the [UNCLEAR - SPOKES?] and so on

684
01:24:59,924 --> 01:25:07,004
- in California
- [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR], then right up through Canada through the Elysium Islands, down through Japan,

685
01:25:07,324 --> 01:25:12,784
down through the Philippines, down through New Guinea and round to New Zealand.

686
01:25:13,024 --> 01:25:19,224
It's all the same geographical red, big geological [UNCLEAR - BANDUNG?] right round the Pacific but

687
01:25:19,484 --> 01:25:25,764
throughout the tempest of Mother Earth, the heat and the boiling

688
01:25:26,024 --> 01:25:31,064
and the boiling lava are quite near to the surface - all the way round there - all

689
01:25:31,664 --> 01:25:37,764
- [UNCLEAR]
- yeah
- This is a colonial hub
- Yes, a number of them

690
01:25:38,084 --> 01:25:44,484
- Hmm, good.
- [UNCLEAR]
- Well, what's this printed here?

691
01:25:45,164 --> 01:25:48,664
Umm?

692
01:25:54,064 --> 01:26:00,084
- Written about [UNCLEAR] in Spain
- [LAUGHTER]
- Are you sure it was something like that?

693
01:26:00,324 --> 01:26:05,184
Because I've seen the coloring there - Spain or Switzerland - Spain

694
01:26:14,084 --> 01:26:19,704
That area is called Property Bay. Property Bay because Kelvin Captain Cook arrived here. He couldn't get on-shore to

695
01:26:20,024 --> 01:26:25,404
- to kill things for food and some -  getting the name Property Bay

696
01:26:26,224 --> 01:26:31,944
Makes one down with most, who's most propitious for him so called it Bay of Plenty.

697
01:26:37,304 --> 01:26:40,584
[UNCLEAR]

698
01:26:42,984 --> 01:26:50,444
- That's a  the mountains and
- All kinds of views and things
- Center of the Island

699
01:26:50,724 --> 01:26:58,064
- The variety is too much.
- It's very much a pastoral land. There's no iron ore in this country at all.

700
01:26:58,264 --> 01:27:02,824
- No iron ore?
- No iron, so there's no steel. All steel has to be imported.

701
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:10,284
- Really?
- So there's no heavy industry
- All, all
- Why don't you import from India we're having surplus? They are having a glut.

702
01:27:11,624 --> 01:27:18,904
- Steel is in glut there.
- Bring together our Prime Minister with
- Hmm but they won't go to India, I think.

703
01:27:20,244 --> 01:27:25,884
Well, Australia next door, of course, also has a surplus of, of iron ore

704
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:33,564
This is another - this is the next, this is the Capital city of the country - this is Wellington, which is most beautiful city - hub all round.

705
01:27:34,264 --> 01:27:42,224
- a lovely
- jungle of mountains
- once you get outside that, it's round this beautiful harbor.

706
01:27:42,664 --> 01:27:47,244
- It's [UNCLEAR]
- It's a capital city like Canberra is.

707
01:27:51,084 --> 01:27:58,164
They say about it that, "People who were blown into the harbor, never ever would get out of it." It's very windy.

708
01:27:58,384 --> 01:28:04,364
- Oh, I see. What's this one?
- That's Wellington again.
- This is nice.

709
01:28:05,404 --> 01:28:11,464
- This part
- This is the old cathedral [UNCLEAR]

710
01:28:17,024 --> 01:28:24,864
- [UNCLEAR] Mother
- [UNCLEAR] scenes are good. Beautiful

711
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:33,284
- There are a number of lakes such are very popular with [UNCLEAR] in the center of the island also.
- Hmm
- [UNCLEAR]

712
01:28:37,204 --> 01:28:42,604
Just like a reflection it is. This way one reflection, this way another.

713
01:28:46,344 --> 01:28:49,384
You see, the photographer is good.

714
01:28:56,544 --> 01:29:00,424
- Very good!
- This is an area where there's skiing.

715
01:29:01,124 --> 01:29:04,884
Very steep - it's snow there, people

716
01:29:07,664 --> 01:29:15,604
A lot of, a lot of the literature - this is Christ Church which is a very English city. See, this is it's Cathedral.

717
01:29:17,224 --> 01:29:24,504
A lot of stories and legends about living in the mountains, living in the rock areas of New Zealand

718
01:29:24,744 --> 01:29:30,584
mastering straight forth  basic jobs

719
01:29:30,784 --> 01:29:37,724
occupy quite a lot of literature in New Zealand literature. French chairs of fasios

720
01:29:39,344 --> 01:29:47,384
- Number of [UNCLEAR] comes up with stones
- Umm?

721
01:29:47,644 --> 01:29:52,344
Comes up with the stones - the wood which is undermined.

722
01:29:53,564 --> 01:30:01,284
- Hillsides with bush are undermined and the bush falls in the sea and is then washed up
- [UNCLEAR]

723
01:30:01,524 --> 01:30:09,424
- [UNCLEAR]
- on the shores
- Hmm. They often become fossilized - very, very hard
- [UNCLEAR]

724
01:30:11,464 --> 01:30:17,784
- There're lovely, lovely waterfalls. I believe the highest waterfall in the world stands in this
- Is it?

725
01:30:18,344 --> 01:30:22,004
- [UNCLEAR]
- South Island
- South Island falls

726
01:30:23,284 --> 01:30:30,344
- Same thing
- Highest meaning - longest flow of water.
- Umm?
- The single drop, I think

727
01:30:30,624 --> 01:30:35,524
- The biggest drop of water
- [UNCLEAR]

728
01:30:41,184 --> 01:30:47,324
- This is New Zealand's biggest industry - ram and goat.
- Yeah, I know.

729
01:30:47,744 --> 01:30:53,684
Quite often, one buys shawls in India made from pure New Zealand merino wool.

730
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:58,324
- Yeah, yes, yes marina wool, merino wool
- That's an [UNCLEAR - IMPORT?]

731
01:30:59,264 --> 01:31:03,824
Yes, I bought a suit length, this time of that Merino wool, yeah.

732
01:31:04,764 --> 01:31:12,784
It's lake Wakatipu which is one of the most famous of the, of the seven lakes. Now it's very much a tourist area so

733
01:31:14,124 --> 01:31:20,304
- has hotels, motels and distractions and amusements for the visitors.
- Hmm

734
01:31:20,924 --> 01:31:26,064
- Hunh
- So this being one of them - this is like build this old farm - it's old

735
01:31:27,064 --> 01:31:30,924
- [UNCLEAR] about gold mine [UNCLEAR]
- Umm

736
01:31:32,824 --> 01:31:39,844
- What about gold? No more available?
- Still [UNCLEAR] still dig but it's not as it was before.

737
01:31:40,224 --> 01:31:47,224
- It's not a big industry as it was once before.
- Hmm
- There was a time when New Zealand took a,

738
01:31:47,464 --> 01:31:52,964
- was part of the International gold chain
- Hmm
- You know, the gold from California to

739
01:31:53,244 --> 01:31:59,644
- Australia
- Yes, yes
- to New Zealand. This is part of the Central Taigo where's a lot of fruit firm. This is

740
01:31:59,844 --> 01:32:07,484
- Beautiful! I've got a painting like this.
- They had to, they crossed company so early they had to put a pox of oil

741
01:32:07,764 --> 01:32:12,244
they put pox of oil on the [UNCLEAR - LIGHT THEM?] to keep the frost away from the blossom

742
01:32:12,484 --> 01:32:17,784
- because the first frosts come after the blossom [UNCLEAR]
- I see

743
01:32:18,404 --> 01:32:26,284
- and then the light can keep them out?
- Yeah - the heat is just strong enough to keep the frost away from the blossom.

744
01:32:27,144 --> 01:32:33,984
It is [UNCLEAR]. It's round about what uh.. it's timberish

745
01:32:34,784 --> 01:32:40,224
It's that the time when in terms like Alexander and so on - is an oily smell in the air

746
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:46,144
- but a little bit lighter when the blossom starts to really appear. It's beautiful! [UNCLEAR].
- The picture of the first rain.

747
01:32:47,404 --> 01:32:53,604
- That's called Sand Fly Bay
- Sand Fly bay?
- Sand fly Bay.

748
01:32:54,004 --> 01:32:59,564
- This one is?
- Hmm, this area
- Sand fly Bay.
- The Bay of Sand flies

749
01:33:04,544 --> 01:33:07,784
- Lot of pictures like that [UNCLEAR]
- It looks like Bhairava to Me.

750
01:33:11,084 --> 01:33:14,184
Yeah, it does - see.

751
01:33:15,024 --> 01:33:20,004
Lot of those rocks have scone of, what you call, birds

752
01:33:21,224 --> 01:33:26,984
- Regular [UNCLEAR]
- Is it in the sea - this one? Looks like Bhairava.

753
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:32,304
This is Mount Cook, which is again, another a mega spot for tourists

754
01:33:32,504 --> 01:33:40,224
It's one of the highest places where you can really have a comfortable hotel; Really posh hotel way up a mountain. Of course, it's very expensive.

755
01:33:42,664 --> 01:33:49,744
- It's called the Southern Alps.
- Let the sahaja yogis go there they'll get it cheaply as we managed it everywhere.

756
01:33:50,884 --> 01:33:55,324
It's all part of Mount Cook - the area.

757
01:33:55,664 --> 01:34:02,604
- Shri Mataji, they've made us another pot of tea. Would You like to have one?
- I don't take so much tea [UNCLEAR]

758
01:34:08,664 --> 01:34:13,984
- Beautiful horses!
- Hmm
- They've grown here. There lots of
- Yes, yes

759
01:34:14,164 --> 01:34:19,804
- You breed them?
- New Zealand is quite famous for it's race horses. The Australians come across here regularly

760
01:34:20,084 --> 01:34:26,864
for their yearling sales and a lot of the Australian race horses come from New Zealand.

761
01:34:29,424 --> 01:34:35,284
So most of the effort in horse-breeding is for racing.

762
01:34:37,644 --> 01:34:44,484
- Very nice - one better than the other; One can't believe it's so great.
- [UNCLEAR]
- Annh, in such a small little place

763
01:34:45,304 --> 01:34:52,504
-  all the beauty is [UNCLEAR]
- There's quite a famous commercial for New Zealand which is [UNCLEAR] time

764
01:34:53,024 --> 01:34:58,244
which says, "The couple in a tourist place, in a tourist shop

765
01:34:58,644 --> 01:35:06,004
and they say, "All excursion group to Norway and you see shops of fields and so on, now let's go to Spain

766
01:35:06,204 --> 01:35:11,944
you see some rolling camps, let's go some," and all the places turn out to be New Zealand.

767
01:35:12,064 --> 01:35:19,124
- because New Zealand has a vast variety of country-side
- You can see so clearly; See such a variety of things.

768
01:35:19,324 --> 01:35:27,224
- So,
- Thank you very much [UNCLEAR]
- it's like, in Australia, You know, You can travel for 200 miles and the country-side will look very much the same, You know

769
01:35:27,384 --> 01:35:34,104
- Boring, yeah
- [UNCLEAR] here to come to have
- Yes
- five miles and the whole country-side changes

770
01:35:34,704 --> 01:35:41,584
Like Yangtze river, every five minutes the rocks change there - everything changes, the

771
01:35:42,304 --> 01:35:48,384
the trees, the style - everything changes. Five minutes you just go ahead, you'll see something else there

772
01:35:48,724 --> 01:35:56,584
- So interesting view the Yangtze river - that's the Tao
- Tao
- and I've done that travelling, luckily.

773
01:35:56,844 --> 01:36:03,664
- Now, this is what Rommel's is, this book is.
- Ah!
- It's called  'Ascent to the Divine'

774
01:36:04,544 --> 01:36:12,264
and this one here, he's tried to prove that whatever is written in the Puranas and all these things, we have the proof of that

775
01:36:12,604 --> 01:36:19,544
in the [UNCLEAR - NATIVE?] that's what he's tried to say. So, this one he took it there and this is My suggestion

776
01:36:19,784 --> 01:36:27,564
to put this photograph here. He's gone to Himalayas and he taken Kailash and Mansarovar. Kailash is -

777
01:36:29,804 --> 01:36:33,664
- See it makes like a four petal thing
- Hmm
- See

778
01:36:38,824 --> 01:36:44,644
- That's the steps - the structure of the land?
- Yes, how it is - structured

779
01:36:45,564 --> 01:36:53,524
- and all centered on Kailash?
- Beg your pardon?
- Is that center on Mount Kailash?
- Yes. All, is the center is the Mount Kailash.

780
01:36:54,444 --> 01:36:59,864
Center is the Mount Kailash where Sadashiva lives, you see, and one side is the Mansarovar, is the Mansa

781
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:08,044
- See this one; That's the, that's the emblem they have got for long that this is Kailasha
- [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]

782
01:37:09,144 --> 01:37:12,524
It's all is his scholarship you can see in this what he's done,

783
01:37:12,864 --> 01:37:18,464
- done it very well but this test you must see.
- That's the most
- This is he's done it with the Kundalini
- Ahh!

784
01:37:18,664 --> 01:37:26,144
[UNCLEAR] how it is, where is Sadashiva, what is it? All these things - he's done it well

785
01:37:27,944 --> 01:37:33,404
- Is this a book for publication in the West?
- Yeah
- It's all sold
- Ah!

786
01:37:40,644 --> 01:37:45,204
Stars I don't know, from where he starts reading. This is it.

787
01:37:45,884 --> 01:37:53,304
- Beautiful!
- Color blue, you see did it in Switzerland. Painting was done in Switzerland.

788
01:37:53,964 --> 01:37:58,764
See the women who live here - very innocent.

789
01:37:59,924 --> 01:38:04,084
It's different there from here - dancing and all that.

790
01:38:05,424 --> 01:38:10,004
You can see yourself; It's very interesting. [UNCLEAR]

791
01:38:17,584 --> 01:38:25,204
- What is that name? Man..
- It is Mansarovar - is the one is the Mahata Manasa - is the superego.

792
01:38:25,624 --> 01:38:30,764
- Ha!
- This is the, you see, Kailasha is the center, then Mansarovar on one side

793
01:38:30,944 --> 01:38:37,984
and I told him, told him, there must be another, that's there, the lake, which is actually the ego - is the rakshas taal, they call it.

794
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:44,924
- Ha!
- And this one is always very peaceful; The other one is turbulent at the slightest move doing it.

795
01:38:45,784 --> 01:38:49,604
- You can see it.
- You're talking about the two, the two lakes
- Yes

796
01:38:50,544 --> 01:38:56,324
- and how the weather can be apparently be similar
- Here, the interesting thing, I'll show you, what he's showed it

797
01:38:56,624 --> 01:39:03,744
you see, the few things that he's brought forth is, the river Ganges, you see, when it comes - see this

798
01:39:04,164 --> 01:39:11,424
thing that; These are their rituals. He dealt with the public there, what sort of people they are

799
01:39:12,084 --> 01:39:19,644
and then he dealt with the ... this is how they kill a big

800
01:39:20,484 --> 01:39:27,544
It's not a bull, it's a male buffalo with all the bhoots in it and all the public sitting there in the night.

801
01:39:27,824 --> 01:39:34,604
He took the picture in the night. So now, he goes on to this climbing and there he saw there.
-

802
01:39:34,744 --> 01:39:41,644
Now it's further on - that's about the people. Now, here he's shown Sadashiva, you see

803
01:39:42,144 --> 01:39:47,304
- and Nandi and this is Mansarovar and this is Sadashiva.
- Ah!
- See this is Kailasha.
- That's Kailasha.

804
01:39:47,544 --> 01:39:54,824
And if you see Kailasha from there it looks like a human-being with Brahma Vishnu in it - you can see it clearly.

805
01:39:55,004 --> 01:40:02,184
This is how they went, you see. This is very difficult to go there, so went by that road that is being given.

806
01:40:06,164 --> 01:40:13,844
- Every, now this is it, see.
- Ah!
- This is Sadashiva and this is Brahma and Vishnu here
- Ah!

807
01:40:14,124 --> 01:40:21,864
- and this is Mansarovar
- That's, the hills the shape of the, of the Kailash temple at Ellora

808
01:40:22,024 --> 01:40:29,544
Yes, it's just like that - yes, he's shown that also. [UNCLEAR] This is how they sacrifice goats and things

809
01:40:29,924 --> 01:40:37,824
in the name of God but he's shown here, see, these things have given the shapes to the temple, you see.

810
01:40:37,964 --> 01:40:44,584
They have taken from here. He's tried to show this will also look like temples but these are not man-made.

811
01:40:45,324 --> 01:40:52,544
These are not man-made - at Kailash they are like this, so from there they have taken this idea; He's tried to depict it.

812
01:40:53,444 --> 01:41:00,384
This is the Rakshas taal. [UNCLEAR] Then, he comes in between with this

813
01:41:01,064 --> 01:41:07,944
two, three things, you see, like he's shown here how in the villages is depicted like this - the Kailasha.

814
01:41:08,904 --> 01:41:15,604
Now going up, there's one good thing he's shown - the Swayambhu of - see the color schemes

815
01:41:16,024 --> 01:41:19,144
- That's like Chinese paintings
- Yes, and see this also

816
01:41:20,044 --> 01:41:27,924
- is the [UNCLEAR]
- It's like the terrace is going up to the Himalayas
- And this is the Kailash seen from this angle - these people are seeing that, he's showiing.

817
01:41:29,244 --> 01:41:35,904
Now, this is a kind of a thing that happens sometimes that is a, this is the Devi's,

818
01:41:36,484 --> 01:41:40,264
uh.. Devi's mountain they say. This is the goddess.

819
01:41:41,704 --> 01:41:44,924
- Parwati's
- What is the Panna?
- Parwati's

820
01:41:46,064 --> 01:41:53,324
They've got different, different things and this is the valley of flowers; Is all natural in the jungle, they say - valley [UNCLEAR]

821
01:41:54,464 --> 01:42:01,764
You see, he's depicted in a way that how you have to go now to river Ganges [UNCLEAR] to river Ganges.

822
01:42:02,484 --> 01:42:08,724
See, how people are climbing [UNCLEAR]. See now, now this is Amarnath, Amarnath temple.

823
01:42:09,144 --> 01:42:15,044
See, this is the - this is the lady when she sees Amarnath; His photography is very good.

824
01:42:15,704 --> 01:42:22,364
Then, this is what they do for the dead. People who are dead, they give them food and this and that - that is what, is a ritual.

825
01:42:23,484 --> 01:42:29,704
Now, this is where they reach. See the [UNCLEAR]

826
01:42:29,904 --> 01:42:36,024
this is the place and this. It's so cold, so cold and this fellow is sitting without any clothes there.

827
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:41,244
and here it is where the guru Gita was taught to Parwati - this is the place, is here.

828
01:42:41,464 --> 01:42:45,884
Ah, this is where He says, "I would play the game

829
01:42:46,104 --> 01:42:50,164
- and I would teach You the things that you have taught Me."
- Yeah, this is it.

830
01:42:50,404 --> 01:42:57,544
this is the place. Now, this is most wonderful is that, this Ganesha is made automatically, spontaneously.

831
01:42:57,764 --> 01:43:03,944
for a very short time. It lives for about three or four days. It has tremendous vibrations and that is [UNCLEAR] See how [UNCLEAR]

832
01:43:05,004 --> 01:43:11,844
- It's ice, is it?
- It's ice. It's - comes down from one little hole there.

833
01:43:12,004 --> 01:43:15,984
And this is made - only for two three days it stays, this Ganesha.

834
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:25,744
And this is the famous Amarnath thing which is made on a particular day is completed.

835
01:43:26,404 --> 01:43:29,424
That's the Purnima Shivratri - that day it is complete.

836
01:43:31,624 --> 01:43:38,184
It, then it dissolves again. Then again it starts building up - then again it builds up to Shivratri day.

837
01:43:38,844 --> 01:43:45,584
Here he has shown, how the Pandavas, when they were in exile, they went and worshiped Shiva instance

838
01:43:45,824 --> 01:43:50,464
- just a pilgrimage. He's done lot of work, no doubt.

839
01:43:52,564 --> 01:44:00,404
Then, now he's talking about the River Ganges - how the River Ganges has come and what, how it has come down

840
01:44:01,064 --> 01:44:08,124
He's taken a very - he's describing here, see, the River Ganges is flowing through this. Same way he will show there

841
01:44:08,384 --> 01:44:12,104
how it flows down. You see, this is Bhagirath,

842
01:44:12,344 --> 01:44:17,224
who prayed for Her coming, so he's praying here, in the, in the mythology.

843
01:44:18,304 --> 01:44:24,784
And this is what seen, so he says this is the churning of the ocean which took place

844
01:44:25,104 --> 01:44:31,524
and Shiva is sitting there. The two oceans are, part of the oceans are there - one on this side, one on the other side.

845
01:44:31,704 --> 01:44:38,464
This is Mansarovar and this is the thing with which it was churned; See here they have shown the churning.

846
01:44:38,824 --> 01:44:44,884
- Ah, yeah.
- See, this is
- This is Krishna
- This is Krishna, of course, Krishna was the one

847
01:44:45,124 --> 01:44:48,404
who did it but on top of him is, see, this one

848
01:44:50,564 --> 01:44:56,084
And all this came out of His - Ashwathama, this is Airawat; Fourteen things came out of it.

849
01:45:02,764 --> 01:45:08,904
Now, this is River Ganges he's tried to show, how the River Ganges comes into the [UNCLEAR - THING?] and

850
01:45:09,264 --> 01:45:16,044
see this man sitting there and worshiping. Now, it's said, the Airawata, the one

851
01:45:16,284 --> 01:45:23,424
the elephant that came out, bring out the [UNCLEAR] to pierce here through the

852
01:45:23,644 --> 01:45:31,684
mountain and this is the piercing point; But I don't know how Rommel has taken this because it is a very precarious point from there the river flows.

853
01:45:38,564 --> 01:45:44,684
Then, it's the same Ganges river is shown flowing down - this is another one

854
01:45:47,644 --> 01:45:54,984
This has references that side, then he goes down, how the river came in and how they worship, you see,

855
01:45:55,404 --> 01:46:03,044
all this is the River Ganges. Just see, the depiction is - mountains are shown this way

856
01:46:03,944 --> 01:46:11,184
- He's tried to
- It's very, the parts of New Zealand are very, very similar
- Yes, very similar, yes.

857
01:46:11,844 --> 01:46:17,964
Now see, this is the Banaras - I think, this is Haridwar [UNCLEAR] like this.

858
01:46:18,324 --> 01:46:25,424
I mean, what he's tried to show, that whatever is described about the river, is absolutely so.

859
01:46:25,784 --> 01:46:32,764
this you can see the things thereas happening. Also, in the paintings how the river is described

860
01:46:32,944 --> 01:46:39,964
and this is again the Ganges again flowing; So all this he's described in the book what it is and his theory about it.

861
01:46:40,324 --> 01:46:47,124
- He's described his theory that is always [UNCLEAR]
- Hmm, lovely book.

862
01:46:47,804 --> 01:46:54,204
- Shri Mother, would You like tea [UNCLEAR] dinner?

863
01:46:54,644 --> 01:47:00,264
- What is it?
- Plain or fish?
- Anything, I mean..

864
01:47:00,904 --> 01:47:06,724
- [UNCLEAR]
- Whatever you have.
- Plain fish
- Would You prefer fish?
- Whatever you have.

865
01:47:06,844 --> 01:47:12,164
- I mean, fish you have or?
- Fish and lamb.
- Oh, I'll have lamb because I had fish

866
01:47:15,304 --> 01:47:21,184
- What, have you cooked it or not?
- No, no I'm just going to.
- Better cook fish then fish will be faster, alright.

867
01:47:21,404 --> 01:47:28,904
- Oh, it is quite
- Is it? Alright, then put lamb - whatever suits you.
- Would You like sour, a little sour
- Yes, I'll have

868
01:47:29,184 --> 01:47:33,904
- [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]
- Put it [UNCLEAR]

869
01:47:36,404 --> 01:47:41,724
Anything is alright, you see, I don't understand much about food. I know how to cook

870
01:47:42,224 --> 01:47:49,324
But the theory is very great in there, the theory - the way he's worked it out. The book's name is, 'Ascent to the Divine'

871
01:47:49,984 --> 01:47:52,944
and he's worked out through Kundalini also.

872
01:47:54,924 --> 01:48:01,884
This is relating everything through the Himalayas to

873
01:48:03,244 --> 01:48:09,784
progress for the Divine to the nature of Divinity - Kailash has been the center of that particular world

874
01:48:10,444 --> 01:48:15,904
and with the, with the ego and the superego, these two lakes on either side one...

875
01:48:16,084 --> 01:48:22,824
There're two lakes. One is called as the Mansarovar is the superego and the another is the ego is the

876
01:48:23,004 --> 01:48:30,644
called as, what you call that, Rakshas Taal. Rakshas Tall, which gets into turbulence.

877
01:48:44,984 --> 01:48:52,244
You mentioned in, in India, Shri Mataji, about various woods, asking about what would make [UNCLEAR].

878
01:48:52,424 --> 01:48:58,524
- huh.
- I collected a few pieces of wood, of New Zealand wood, see here

879
01:49:00,084 --> 01:49:06,644
- that is, that one is called Toteara
- What is it?
- Toteara

880
01:49:07,044 --> 01:49:11,384
- To-ta
- Toteara. T-O-T-E-A-R-A Toteara
- Toteara

881
01:49:13,364 --> 01:49:16,424
It's a very light wood, Toteara, isn't it?

882
01:49:26,804 --> 01:49:32,444
Beautiful grains, though but very light, I feel. Hmm

883
01:49:32,724 --> 01:49:39,704
- So, that's Kaori
- hunh?
- That's Kaori
- Kaori, I see.

884
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:48,824
- That's what is the most popular wood in New Zealand for.
- But you cannot make furniture out of it
- Yes, furniture is made out of Kaori
- Really!

885
01:49:50,304 --> 01:49:55,844
- And doors and things
- Yes and plates of various soup -

886
01:49:56,064 --> 01:49:59,324
- that's an AUM
- Oh, that's beautiful!

887
01:50:07,144 --> 01:50:11,364
[UNCLEAR] is this but is this a strong wood to [UNCLEAR]?

888
01:50:12,384 --> 01:50:17,664
It's quite a, yes, it's quite a resilient wood, it's quite a

889
01:50:18,264 --> 01:50:26,204
- Is it Brazilian?
- No, it's a, it's a resilient wood. It needs a lot of working. It's hard wood to work.
- O, resilient.

890
01:50:27,224 --> 01:50:34,264
- You have to work very hard with it, is it?
- There's another one which is even more so
- You have to clean it much more, is it?

891
01:50:34,664 --> 01:50:40,424
- Yes, it has to be, it's, it's, it's
- It's like Rosewood. You have to work hard to get

892
01:50:40,644 --> 01:50:45,744
- You can't work, you can't go ahead because it breaks off.

893
01:50:46,104 --> 01:50:53,484
- You have to be careful and [UNCLEAR] continue it
- Breaks up fast
- Hmm, this is a, this is a very, very difficult wood to work.

894
01:50:54,564 --> 01:51:01,044
- but it's, there's some of it which is even more [UNCLEAR], it's called [UNCLEAR]
- Is it?

895
01:51:01,244 --> 01:51:05,524
[UNCLEAR] It's a, it has a very rich red flower and

896
01:51:05,764 --> 01:51:11,624
and it's known as the New Zealand Christmas tree because at Christmas time it comes out of these bright

897
01:51:11,864 --> 01:51:18,304
- beautiful red flower.
- What greens annh? What a beauty!
- But that's a very, very difficult wood to work
- But it's also oily

898
01:51:18,704 --> 01:51:24,764
- Would be good wood - this will be good like something nearer Rosewood, not so much but

899
01:51:24,964 --> 01:51:29,104
- That's, that's Remo
- What's that?
- That's Remo
- Remo

900
01:51:29,504 --> 01:51:34,584
That's quite a popular wood for making plates and so on [UNCLEAR]

901
01:51:35,184 --> 01:51:41,984
- But what do they use for furniture here? This would be [UNCLEAR]
- Kaori mostly [UNCLEAR], Remo - yes

902
01:51:42,164 --> 01:51:46,064
- [UNCLEAR] This would be
- Tables and chairs
- Pine
- Yes the

903
01:51:46,284 --> 01:51:50,684
- Pine?
- Pine
- Is it strong? Is it?

904
01:51:51,744 --> 01:51:59,664
- It's very hard wood [UNCLEAR] strong
- In India Pine is no good
- there are a number, there are a number of Pines grown here - different sorts of Pines.

905
01:51:59,844 --> 01:52:03,524
Some are used for buildings, some are used for

906
01:52:03,804 --> 01:52:08,204
- furniture making, some are treated, some are specially treated
- What's this one?

907
01:52:12,704 --> 01:52:17,504
- It's what? Fur
- Fur

908
01:52:23,384 --> 01:52:30,824
Very nice! This is the wood they have, all kinds - haven't seen one like this before, haven't seen.

909
01:52:31,024 --> 01:52:35,904
- That's, that's, that's
- What do you call this?
- [UNCLEAR - AHUTAKAWA?]

910
01:52:36,184 --> 01:52:42,524
- Ahuto
- Ahutakawa
- Kawa
- It's all one word - Ahutakawa
- Ahutakawa

911
01:52:44,144 --> 01:52:51,844
It's a very distinctive - I mean, at Christmas time, if You looked around here - stood outside and looked around, You'd see the Ahutakawa's in all directions.

912
01:52:52,244 --> 01:52:57,764
- Is it?
- with these bright red flowers and when they fall, they fall like red needles
- So nice

913
01:52:57,864 --> 01:53:03,624
- [UNCLEAR - THEMSELVES?] washed or red needles on the pavement
- Like bottle-brush are they? Like bottle brush?

914
01:53:03,904 --> 01:53:09,804
- A little like that - yeah, needly, a needly flower
- [UNCLEAR] pick You one
- Hmm

915
01:53:12,524 --> 01:53:19,524
- and in case, it's going to be our Puja
- [UNCLEAR]
- Oh, that's also [UNCLEAR]

916
01:53:20,084 --> 01:53:28,024
- We'll see now what's the situation is like. Beautiful, it's very nicely done. Yes, that's the same one? No, this is another wood, I think.

917
01:53:28,264 --> 01:53:35,344
- That's [UNCLEAR]
- Same as that. This is alright for furniture, I think.
- Hmm.
- This would be.

918
01:53:36,104 --> 01:53:39,944
So they make here some furniture out of this wood, do they?

919
01:53:43,064 --> 01:53:50,784
- The, the
- Very strong
- There was a quick desire for furniture like Kaori and [UNCLEAR - REMO?] and so on

920
01:53:50,964 --> 01:53:55,524
- You'd to have a table and chairs made out of
- Kaori, hmm
- expensive tree
- Hmm

921
01:53:59,544 --> 01:54:04,684
- Very good collection. You put them up somewhere you're able to see - it's nice.
- Mother, there's, there's

922
01:54:04,944 --> 01:54:08,284
If you see them as a collection, then you see the beauty of these.

923
01:54:09,664 --> 01:54:17,384
- Yeah. We bought those since You are interested in eventual about making, making

924
01:54:17,884 --> 01:54:22,984
what ones were good for making plates are of, in India, so we wondered whether those

925
01:54:23,244 --> 01:54:30,964
- any of those woods You might like and we could
- make plates
- have plates made for You if You would like them
- Plates

926
01:54:42,744 --> 01:54:50,004
So the thing is, plates if you make, then we eat anything in it, it can be spoilt because wood doesn't take water [UNCLEAR]

927
01:54:51,444 --> 01:54:57,164
- What they do here is, they
- Lacquer it
- In the country there's also a wax

928
01:54:57,384 --> 01:55:02,684
that they, that they use for sealing the wood.

929
01:55:02,984 --> 01:55:09,524
What is the best for doing anything here is the handles, the door handles of wood?

930
01:55:09,824 --> 01:55:15,004
Handles is very important. What I've seen that now, you see, we have taken to these

931
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:22,884
other metals and all that - after some time these handles become very, very smooth

932
01:55:23,104 --> 01:55:28,064
so much so that the can't open them; You see, you go on pushing sometimes you get locked with them

933
01:55:28,524 --> 01:55:34,664
but if you have these handles with little working of brass or something on top

934
01:55:34,884 --> 01:55:40,884
they will look very nice, I think; Better for making handles than anything like that.

935
01:55:41,144 --> 01:55:48,384
For these handles for the say, this one for the knives and things, you see - artistic.

936
01:55:49,224 --> 01:55:55,144
To do something artistic work with them but if you start using them for plates

937
01:55:55,784 --> 01:56:03,484
they may be spoilt but in India we use lot of it for salads and for dahi.

938
01:56:04,284 --> 01:56:08,204
They make dahi, actually in the villages they make dahi only in the wooden

939
01:56:08,544 --> 01:56:14,724
- What is dahi?
- Dahi is yogurt.
- Annh, make it in wood?
- Hmm - is the best, they say.

940
01:56:15,004 --> 01:56:20,064
- In this you try some dahi - is the best.
- It keeps the heat, isn't it?
- Very good.

941
01:56:21,384 --> 01:56:26,964
Apart from that, dahi can, you see, metal can be little bit absorbed in the yogurt

942
01:56:27,224 --> 01:56:34,264
but this is absolutely is, doesn't absorb any acid

943
01:56:35,064 --> 01:56:40,784
It's very good, so in India mostly they use for dahi - yogurt.

944
01:56:41,844 --> 01:56:45,544
Dahibada, dahi - anything they make out of dahi, they make it

945
01:56:50,904 --> 01:56:56,604
- That one is a very knotty wood, it's very twisted
- Annh?
- twisted, knotty that
- That one is

946
01:56:56,724 --> 01:57:02,864
- that's why it's so difficult to
- unnh, knotted one, unnh but anyone - this one can be used also
-
-

947
01:57:03,264 --> 01:57:09,924
India we have big, big, things like that, you see, made for this and then we also use it for

948
01:57:11,924 --> 01:57:17,824
so many things we use wooden things - like for,

949
01:57:19,004 --> 01:57:25,504
you know, when we make chappatis we have to knead aata - for that also we use the same thing

950
01:57:25,744 --> 01:57:29,804
- the wooden
- Yes, I mean, in the villages even now they use it.

951
01:57:30,104 --> 01:57:34,664
- but cities have become so much plastic and stainless steel and all.

952
01:57:35,324 --> 01:57:41,584
I should tell you, we went to the shop, you see, to buy some things and there the most expensive things were made of plastic

953
01:57:41,964 --> 01:57:49,404
next to that was glass - really, and third was the moulded glass and the cheapest was

954
01:57:49,644 --> 01:57:57,564
the hand cut glass from Bohemia [LAUGHTER][UNCLEAR]

955
01:57:57,784 --> 01:58:05,204
- Topsy turvy
- Really, it's so topsy turvy in one shop it was and people were buying all expensive things like glass and this

956
01:58:05,924 --> 01:58:11,064
and I bought this Bohemian glass. I said, "This is cut glass. One piece is so expensive in London.

957
01:58:11,264 --> 01:58:18,804
Here why is it the the other way round people are there," - They are like Indians, I think. Like Indians would buy polyester than cotton sort of thing.

958
01:58:19,364 --> 01:58:27,384
So, they would buy plastic; Plastics are the most expensive some thing like this plastic was more expensive than the wood itself.

959
01:58:27,644 --> 01:58:34,644
[UNCLEAR] Warren didn't understand what was the thing going on. There were two other sahaja yogis. They started looking at it. I said, "What is this -

960
01:58:35,064 --> 01:58:40,804
plastic so very expensive and hand-cut Bohemian glass is the cheapest?"

961
01:58:41,144 --> 01:58:46,524
What's happening to people? Absolutely, I don't know, what's happening to them?"

962
01:58:48,604 --> 01:58:55,864
Haan, the best part was the cheapest were the silver-plated - that was the best part - 40% less.

963
01:58:56,684 --> 01:59:03,304
- Cheapest was the silver-plated, pure silver-plated.
- Was this related just to the market? I mean, it wasn't sort of the thing that people pay.

964
01:59:03,444 --> 01:59:08,404
- this is the sort of money
- This is something, I can't understand the mentality what's happening to them

965
01:59:09,184 --> 01:59:16,264
- It's like nylon saris.
- It's nylon saris, something like that, same style but I mean, you are developed country, we are developing, so we are stupid.

966
01:59:16,784 --> 01:59:23,164
I can't understand why should you be that stupid as to have [UNCLEAR]! Best was the Bohemian glass. Then I said,

967
01:59:23,524 --> 01:59:31,484
"This is just ordinary glass - is more expensive than Bohemian hand-cut; It is really to be seen, I mean, you can't believe it

968
01:59:32,624 --> 01:59:40,504
such a thing happening. And then, of all the things silver-plated means there's silver plated - such beautiful designs are 40% less.

969
01:59:44,664 --> 01:59:49,924
Just we couldn't understand. Now, the things would be like this one day

970
01:59:50,304 --> 01:59:57,184
will be the price of plastic is more than something made of gold.

971
01:59:57,964 --> 02:00:04,124
If you move in this direction, what is going to happen. Absurd, really absurd!

972
02:00:06,304 --> 02:00:10,504
There is a link presumably, Shri Mataji, between

973
02:00:11,164 --> 02:00:16,064
- knowing what is valuable and what is appropriate and what is auspicious.
- Hmm

974
02:00:16,484 --> 02:00:23,004
Innate value - people know it's innate value. Now of course, the plastic is nice we wash it, put it what you like -

975
02:00:23,324 --> 02:00:28,864
I mean, it's nice you can throw it where you like, it's very practical, this, that,  it has a practical value

976
02:00:29,164 --> 02:00:37,264
but still, compared to Bohemian glass, I mean, to buy plastic at an expensive price -  more expensive - this I could not understand.

977
02:00:38,784 --> 02:00:46,244
- I just could not understand that.
- It is so, it's mass produced so

978
02:00:46,444 --> 02:00:53,444
- So many [UNCLEAR]
- but that should be cheaper? If it is mass produced, it should be cheaper; It's the other way round.

979
02:00:54,964 --> 02:01:00,844
Bohemian glass, can you imagine, Bohemian tumblers? I mean, first I saw, then again I couldn't believe.

980
02:01:01,084 --> 02:01:05,344
-  I called Warren, I said, "See, is it true?"
- "Yes Mother, it is so."

981
02:01:07,944 --> 02:01:15,904
- So I don't know, where is Australia now, where is it going? Is it developed or developing or
- Going backwards

982
02:01:16,144 --> 02:01:21,324
And on the other round in the exhibition they were wearing funny dresses like the cave-girls.

983
02:01:25,604 --> 02:01:32,364
I think, it's all conditioning of the mind. It's conditioning through the advertisement, this, that. The people

984
02:01:33,884 --> 02:01:41,124
know things in their mind something and then they see it, they want to buy that; It is more conditioning - they don't have their own personality now.

985
02:01:41,424 --> 02:01:48,424
No perspective of their own to see things. They, whatever is told to them morning till evening see, just blasted into their heads

986
02:01:48,644 --> 02:01:54,984
everyday they see in the television this, that, so that's it; That must be the reason.

987
02:02:01,164 --> 02:02:08,044
- Things that were important here, have a special value.
- No, it was, that's what I am telling

988
02:02:08,244 --> 02:02:14,304
- [UNCLEAR] see there, they think to be thought of better
- All imported thing?

989
02:02:14,704 --> 02:02:20,544
That's everywhere but the Bohemian I'm saying, Bohemian glass was the cheapest of all.

990
02:02:20,984 --> 02:02:27,644
- with hand cut, you know. I was so surprised
- I think, they would be very expensive here.
-

991
02:02:28,284 --> 02:02:34,244
- Here?
- The Bohemian glass will be very expensive here.
- Here, so then New Zealanders are alright, then.

992
02:02:34,464 --> 02:02:38,704
[LAUGHTER] I just couldn't understand it.

993
02:02:39,864 --> 02:02:47,324
Perhaps, you see, what I judged must be this way. That it's a Bohemian glass, then you have to be careful about it

994
02:02:47,664 --> 02:02:54,544
you have to keep it in the cupboard most of the time to see it and you don't use it much, may be that

995
02:02:54,824 --> 02:03:00,164
it will break but it is cheaper than plastic then what's the harm.

996
02:03:08,424 --> 02:03:15,144
German and Bohemian hand cut things they had, German, of course, was not so good.

997
02:03:15,504 --> 02:03:18,924
but Bohemian, I was surprised - so beautifully done.

998
02:03:23,684 --> 02:03:29,564
And the silver, the silver-plating was five years guarantee - such good

999
02:03:29,924 --> 02:03:35,604
and the cheapest of that was stainless steel - it was five times more expensive. Ask Warren.

1000
02:03:35,724 --> 02:03:43,584
"Warren, just tell them about the shop where the stainless steel was five times more than the silver - wasn't it?"

1001
02:03:43,784 --> 02:03:51,284
We were get it through all this. It was Edmund's of all things. You know Edmund's chain of stores in Australia and

1002
02:03:53,124 --> 02:03:58,604
well, we were just going through everything. We found all this beautiful silver and then we started pricing the other things

1003
02:03:58,990 --> 02:04:02,105
and finally we got worked away through the various metals

1004
02:04:02,130 --> 02:04:06,387
and we got to this stainless steel and stainless steel was about three times the price.

1005
02:04:30,288 --> 02:04:34,499
But it's the other way around with glass
too. Did Mother tell you?

1006
02:04:34,524 --> 02:04:35,317
Bohemia

1007
02:04:35,342 --> 02:04:36,389
Bohemian glass

1008
02:04:36,414 --> 02:04:41,314
This hand-cut crystal was cheaper than [UNCLEAR]

1009
02:04:41,339 --> 02:04:46,278
No, and the glass, ordinary glass was
even more expensive than the pressed one
