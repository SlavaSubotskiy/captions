1
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:08,413
Today is a great day of Navaratri,

2
00:00:09,413 --> 00:00:14,913
we are sitting on the cusp of the sixth and the seventh.

3
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:23,913
Sixth and the seventh is the day when Mahasaraswati

4
00:00:23,913 --> 00:00:28,913
finished Her work

5
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:33,913
and the incarnation of the Shakti itself started.

6
00:00:33,913 --> 00:00:39,413
So, at twelve o’clock today the Devi takes the Shakti upon Herself.

7
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:48,413
Of course, as you know that Mahakali and Mahasaraswati,

8
00:00:48,413 --> 00:01:00,413
both are the powers of Shri Sadashiva.

9
00:01:00,413 --> 00:01:08,413
Adi Shakti first formed Herself into Mahakali,

10
00:01:08,413 --> 00:01:13,413
which is the Power of Desire.

11
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:18,413
But all these powers are nothing

12
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:25,413
but the power of God’s love.

13
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:36,413
So, in the series of this great love of God,

14
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:42,413
Adi Shakti had to first become the Power of Desire.

15
00:01:42,413 --> 00:01:43,413
In the same way,

16
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:48,413
Sahaja Yogis who are bestowed with this power of love

17
00:01:48,413 --> 00:01:53,413
have to have full desire in their heart.

18
00:01:53,413 --> 00:02:00,413
Desire to love.

19
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:07,413
That desire is very different from

20
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:12,413
the other kinds of human love we have known.

21
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:16,413
In other kinds of human love,

22
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:19,413
when we have relations with others,

23
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:23,413
we have expectations,

24
00:02:24,413 --> 00:02:29,413
and that’s why it is very disappointing.

25
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:33,413
Our expectations always run higher

26
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:39,413
than our understanding and realities.

27
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:44,413
And so we suffer from disappointments and frustrations.

28
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:50,913
And the love that has to be nourishing and fulfilling

29
00:02:50,913 --> 00:02:54,913
becomes a thankless job.

30
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:59,913
So, when it reflects in the human beings,

31
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:04,913
it is the desire to be loved by everyone,

32
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:08,913
not to love others.

33
00:03:08,913 --> 00:03:11,913
Everyone should love you,

34
00:03:11,913 --> 00:03:15,913
but how far you love another is the point.

35
00:03:15,913 --> 00:03:18,913
Naturally everyone for oneself!

36
00:03:18,913 --> 00:03:21,913
So really nobody loves.

37
00:03:21,913 --> 00:03:26,913
But when it comes to real love

38
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:32,913
then sacrifice, becomes a nature.

39
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:36,913
You don’t call it a sacrifice but you call it a privilege.

40
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:41,913
We say it’s a privilege to give love.

41
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:46,913
It’s a great chance that we can love.

42
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:51,913
It’s our great fortune that we can love.

43
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:56,913
It’s God’s blessings that we can love and give.

44
00:03:56,913 --> 00:04:02,913
So the giving starts when you realise,

45
00:04:02,913 --> 00:04:06,913
not understand but realise the love,

46
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,913
the power of love expressing .

47
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:14,913
That’s the third power, which starts expressing .

48
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:16,913
Because, after this,

49
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:20,913
a person becomes active, kriyasheet.

50
00:04:20,913 --> 00:04:24,913
That’s how the action of

51
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:29,913
achieving that state of giving love starts.

52
00:04:29,913 --> 00:04:33,913
To begin with we start activating in so many ways.

53
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:39,913
As I said, we start expecting

54
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:46,913
and thinking that we are loving others.

55
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:50,913
We act for that.

56
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:54,913
In that madness that others should love us,

57
00:04:54,913 --> 00:04:56,913
others should respect us,

58
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,913
others should think we are great,

59
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:00,913
they should recognise us

60
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:05,913
we start loving something else which is not so important.

61
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:10,913
So, we go on first to money,

62
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:13,913
money becomes a very important point.

63
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:19,913
We think that, if we have money, people will love us.

64
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:23,913
We become very powerful as moneyed people,

65
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:26,913
as rich people.

66
00:05:26,913 --> 00:05:28,913
So we start accumulating money,

67
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:35,913
we start loving the money.

68
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:38,913
But money is not the Truth;

69
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:40,913
we don’t love the Truth.

70
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:43,913
When we start loving the money

71
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:46,913
we start thinking about problems of money.

72
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:54,913
Such people can become miserly to such an extent

73
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:57,913
that even towards God they become miserly.

74
00:05:57,913 --> 00:05:58,913
They never have money actually,

75
00:05:58,913 --> 00:06:01,913
because if you cannot spend your money, you have no money.

76
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:06,913
If it is not available what’s the use of having all the money?

77
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:09,913
That’s how they have problems

78
00:06:09,913 --> 00:06:16,913
because they love money and not the God Almighty.

79
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:22,913
They’re worried about money but not about the Truth.

80
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:27,913
Then with that they go to a second thing: is the power.

81
00:06:27,913 --> 00:06:30,913
They want to have the power;

82
00:06:30,913 --> 00:06:32,913
they want to become presidents,

83
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:37,913
ministers and bureaucrats and all that.

84
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:40,913
They want to have the power:

85
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:43,913
they think by having great power

86
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:45,913
people will respect them and love them.

87
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:50,913
But they get drowned in fear.

88
00:06:50,913 --> 00:06:54,913
What they get is fear. All the time they have fear.

89
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:57,913
Also moneyed people have fear.

90
00:06:57,913 --> 00:07:03,913
That’s why in the Bible it is said that: wages of sin is fear.

91
00:07:03,913 --> 00:07:08,913
What is sin? Sin is not to love the Truth.

92
00:07:08,913 --> 00:07:12,913
Is the sin. When you don’t love the Truth then it is sin.

93
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:18,913
So when you start getting worried about your positions…

94
00:07:18,913 --> 00:07:24,913
Like the president feels that he’ll lose his job,

95
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:31,913
the vice president thinks that he’ll be sacked,

96
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:36,913
the prime minister thinks he may not be elected,

97
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:40,913
the bureaucrats think they will lose their jobs,

98
00:07:40,913 --> 00:07:42,913
they won’t get promotions or something,

99
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:44,913
there will be problem.

100
00:07:44,913 --> 00:07:48,913
All these people are suffering from terrible sense of fear.

101
00:07:48,913 --> 00:07:51,913
They have no freedom of any kind.

102
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:56,913
And in that category people just go down so much with fear,

103
00:07:56,913 --> 00:08:00,913
that even worse than people with money.

104
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,913
Because once they are lost they are lost.

105
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:07,913
They can never revive. No chance.

106
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:09,913
Once you lose the elections you are lost,

107
00:08:09,913 --> 00:08:10,913
nobody is going to look at you.

108
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:14,913
I have known people who have been at a very high position

109
00:08:14,913 --> 00:08:19,913
and once they lose that position nobody looks at them,

110
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:20,913
they just walk like straight,

111
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:24,913
otherwise there will be at least hundred cars to receive them.

112
00:08:24,913 --> 00:08:28,913
And once they lose their jobs there’s nobody even to look at them.

113
00:08:28,913 --> 00:08:31,913
They just walk like ordinary people.

114
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:34,913
Even seeing all these things happening,

115
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:40,913
this truth just coming before them so clearly,

116
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:44,913
they do not keep to that truth,

117
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:47,913
they do not realise that truth,

118
00:08:47,913 --> 00:08:53,913
they do not have that realisation within them.

119
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:58,913
They understand for a while and they go after that.

120
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,913
Then when the person dies,

121
00:09:01,913 --> 00:09:07,913
they see a moneyed man, a rich man is forgotten,

122
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:11,913
nobody is bothered about them, who was a rich man.

123
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:13,913
On the contrary, the people,

124
00:09:13,913 --> 00:09:17,913
the prime ministers and all those high-ranking people, when they die,

125
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:21,913
immediately books start coming out about their private life:

126
00:09:21,913 --> 00:09:25,913
all the dirty things they did

127
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:30,913
and all the horrible things they did and what sort of life they led

128
00:09:30,913 --> 00:09:32,913
There’s no fragrance in their life,

129
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:36,913
no idealism. Nothing.

130
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:39,913
Because the responsibility

131
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,913
that they have to the public

132
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:46,913
and to themselves they have not understood it

133
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:49,913
and they made a mess of their private life.

134
00:09:49,913 --> 00:09:55,913
That’s why this kind of a reaction comes after it.

135
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:58,913
The other day I was reading

136
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:02,913
an interview with a very well-known actor.

137
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:06,913
He’s a born realised fellow, I know, but he’s gone down completely.

138
00:10:06,913 --> 00:10:09,913
He says, “I think, what’s the harm in drinking,

139
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:11,913
what’s the harm in gambling,?

140
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:13,913
what’s the harm in smoking?

141
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,913
Because, after all, I’m going to die

142
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:22,913
and then who is going to bother?

143
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,913
Supposing, I get cancer, so what?

144
00:10:24,913 --> 00:10:26,913
In any case I’m going to die.

145
00:10:26,913 --> 00:10:29,613
So why not enjoy these pleasures of life?”

146
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:35,613
But what about death? You continue with it.

147
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:39,613
Then all that you’ve been doing will come out,

148
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:45,613
and people will not to like to have your photograph in the household.

149
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:48,613
Children will spit at you. What about that?

150
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:53,613
Your life is not what it is today for three, four years or ten years

151
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:56,613
or fifteen years of your so-called success.

152
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:58,613
But when you die

153
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:02,613
all this craziness will disappear,

154
00:11:02,613 --> 00:11:06,613
and people will come out with truth about you.

155
00:11:06,613 --> 00:11:12,613
That is how this power to be popular finishes off.

156
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:16,613
This cheap popularity,

157
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:24,613
this cheap type of treatment towards yourself

158
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:30,613
gives you a personality that will not be worshipped,

159
00:11:30,613 --> 00:11:33,613
that will not be accepted.

160
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:36,613
Nobody will quote you as something great.

161
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,613
For some time, it will continue,

162
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:44,613
but in totality such a person has given nothing to humanity.

163
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:51,613
That’s how the power of Saraswati works.

164
00:11:51,613 --> 00:11:53,613
People go into action

165
00:11:53,613 --> 00:12:02,613
for achieving the results of getting into power.

166
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:08,613
But it should act to discover the truth.

167
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:18,613
Saraswati should give you the leap to find out the truth.

168
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:25,613
That, when you act in those funny places and streets,

169
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:28,613
you discover this is not the path, we have missed it.

170
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:33,613
The path is somewhere else. We’ve lost it.

171
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:36,613
Let us find out the real path because this doesn’t give joy.

172
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:38,613
This one can learn from others,

173
00:12:38,613 --> 00:12:43,613
from history, from so many other things and from your own parents,

174
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:49,613
from your society and from yourself and from your children also.

175
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:51,613
If you want to learn,

176
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:55,613
that is the quality of Saraswati pujaris,

177
00:12:55,613 --> 00:13:00,613
that they take to gyana, they take to reality.

178
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,613
Vedas, in the beginning of the Vedas,

179
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:05,613
it’s said that:

180
00:13:05,613 --> 00:13:09,613
if by reading these four Vedas,

181
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:13,613
if you do not get the veeda,

182
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:18,613
veeda is the knowledge on your nerves, means Realisation,

183
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:27,613
there is no use reading these Vedas.

184
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:35,613
So the Saraswati’s first thing is that through the reading,

185
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:40,613
through the process of Saraswati’s manifestation,

186
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:45,613
you must reach a point to understand that this is a rat-race,

187
00:13:45,613 --> 00:13:46,613
and we have to get out of it.

188
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:48,613
We have to step out.

189
00:13:48,613 --> 00:13:50,613
When that happens,

190
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:53,613
then the Mahalakshmi Tattwa starts working in you,

191
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:58,613
that is the third tattwa, which starts working.

192
00:14:03,613 --> 00:14:05,613
Mahalakshmi Tattwa

193
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:10,613
then starts expressing its love in its full extent

194
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:15,613
through evolutionary process in human beings.

195
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:19,613
He starts evolving simultaneously.

196
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:23,613
He sees on both the sides what’s happening,

197
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:31,613
like a witness and he uses his Mahalakshmi power.

198
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:35,613
In the first part of the Mahalakshmi power

199
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:43,613
he starts getting out of the common rut of the family bondages

200
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:51,613
and the other human bondages of power,

201
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:54,613
money, lust

202
00:14:54,613 --> 00:14:59,613
and he starts moving on a higher plane.

203
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:07,613
He gives us a new idea of popularity

204
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:12,613
by establishing the Truth.

205
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:15,613
Because through Mahalakshmi power

206
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:21,613
you discover the Truth on your central nervous system

207
00:15:21,613 --> 00:15:32,613
and ultimately it is the light of an enlightened brain.

208
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:40,613
When the Mahalakshmi power starts manifesting,

209
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:45,613
one starts thinking of others.

210
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:48,613
Not on material level,

211
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:50,613
that materially people are suffering,

212
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:53,613
“Now there are people in Ethiopia, who will save?

213
00:15:53,613 --> 00:15:55,613
We must give them some food, this, that.

214
00:15:55,613 --> 00:16:01,613
” No! They go to the roots of the problems. Why?

215
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:03,613
Or they don’t think there should be

216
00:16:03,613 --> 00:16:06,613
equal distribution of money and wealth.

217
00:16:06,613 --> 00:16:09,613
No. This is superficial.

218
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:16,613
Because wherever it is done people are not happy.

219
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:21,613
They feel they have no freedom.

220
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:26,613
Those people who have money are not happy

221
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:31,613
because they have a demonic life.

222
00:16:31,613 --> 00:16:35,613
Where they are free they behave like devils.

223
00:16:35,613 --> 00:16:37,613
No sense of totality,

224
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:40,613
no sense of collectivity.

225
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:44,613
When they become like that,

226
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:54,613
they even do not realise that they have become demonic.

227
00:16:54,613 --> 00:17:00,613
Everything becomes like a big martyrdom.

228
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:03,613
They fight for lands,

229
00:17:03,613 --> 00:17:05,613
they fight for nations,

230
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:09,613
they fight for rights.

231
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,613
And they do all kinds of horrible things.

232
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:19,613
Start destroying people, human beings.

233
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:24,613
All the turmoil of today is the effect of

234
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:27,613
mostly in the West,

235
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,613
and also all the Arabic countries,

236
00:17:31,613 --> 00:17:35,613
I would say – is of the right side.

237
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:42,613
And in the East, it is of the left side - the turmoils.

238
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:47,613
It’s very surprising that

239
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:49,613
it’s very contrasting also.

240
00:17:49,613 --> 00:17:51,613
It’s a funny dilemma for Me,

241
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:54,613
I can’t understand it sometimes

242
00:17:54,613 --> 00:17:58,613
that where they are so particular about the chastity,

243
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:10,613
they become when they are so much worried about chastity and everything,

244
00:18:10,613 --> 00:18:13,613
that they should have problem of the left side.

245
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:16,613
They do puja, they have shraddha,

246
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:18,613
they are like Catholics, we can say,

247
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:19,613
are never rich people,

248
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:24,613
seldom, except in Switzerland,

249
00:18:24,613 --> 00:18:26,613
I think, here everybody’s rich

250
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:30,613
because they are so money-oriented.

251
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:38,613
So, or the people where they are right sided,

252
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:43,613
when they neglect their chastity,

253
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:48,613
not bothered about the right side,

254
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:53,613
they have the problems of the right side,

255
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:57,613
is very surprising.

256
00:18:58,613 --> 00:19:03,613
The reason is where they look after the chastity part

257
00:19:04,613 --> 00:19:07,613
they go too much into it.

258
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:15,613
Now, supposing a person is doing a puja.

259
00:19:17,613 --> 00:19:21,613
He just goes on doing puja, puja, puja morning till evening,

260
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:23,613
without any activity.

261
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:25,613
Very easy to do puja, isn’t it?

262
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:27,613
Just come down,

263
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:29,613
somebody does puja for you, get the vibrations,

264
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:31,613
nicely blessed, go home.

265
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:32,613
Nothing to be done,

266
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:35,613
no activity.

267
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:39,613
So there is no balance.

268
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:44,613
So they do puja and they think, “Oh, they have done very well.”

269
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:47,613
No, if you are a right sided person,

270
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:50,613
then puja will help you,

271
00:19:50,613 --> 00:19:52,613
but not if you are a left sided person.

272
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,613
Puja does help,

273
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:01,613
of course, My Puja will help, no doubt,

274
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:02,613
in both the sides,

275
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:06,613
because I’m neither left nor right nor anywhere.

276
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:22,613
So the puja part when they do …

277
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:28,613
supposing a man is doing a puja to a Devi.

278
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:34,613
In India they take a great courage to do puja to a Devi,

279
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:35,613
you do not know that.

280
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:37,613
Saptashati. That’s where we have

281
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,613
that thing that the way people do,

282
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,613
they get possessed,

283
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:42,613
they can’t understand.

284
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:45,613
First of all, they have a statue of someone

285
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:47,613
made by some horrible fellow.

286
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,613
When they will do the puja of that Goddess,

287
00:20:50,613 --> 00:20:52,613
they are God-fearing,

288
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:54,613
everything is good,

289
00:20:54,613 --> 00:20:58,613
we have got temples where there are also,

290
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:01,613
we can say, swayambhus

291
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:05,613
from the Mother Earth,

292
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:07,613
which are worshipped

293
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:08,613
and should be all right,

294
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:11,613
but no, they get possessed. Why?

295
00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:14,613
Because most of them,

296
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:20,613
these temples are hounded by or haunted by spirits.

297
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,613
Because they do all kinds of tantaric things there.

298
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:26,613
And when people go and do the pujas there

299
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:29,613
what happens to them?

300
00:21:29,613 --> 00:21:32,613
That they get attacked,

301
00:21:34,613 --> 00:21:36,613
they become more left sided.

302
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:42,613
Now the Muslims and others who believe in a God

303
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:43,613
which is neerakara,

304
00:21:43,613 --> 00:21:45,613
which is formless,

305
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:50,613
they go to the right side.

306
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:52,613
There’s formless God,

307
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:54,613
it’s nice, formless everywhere is God,

308
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,613
in Me, in you, everyone there is God,

309
00:21:57,613 --> 00:21:59,613
everybody’s God.

310
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:02,613
Even if you are a devil, you are God.

311
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,613
There’s nothing wrong with anyone,

312
00:22:05,613 --> 00:22:07,613
everybody’s God,

313
00:22:07,613 --> 00:22:09,613
starts on that principle.

314
00:22:12,613 --> 00:22:15,613
So they go onto supraconscious side

315
00:22:15,613 --> 00:22:18,613
and they become demonic.

316
00:22:21,613 --> 00:22:23,613
Then they must fight,

317
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:24,613
because they are devils. Devils have to fight;

318
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:27,613
otherwise, how will they exist?

319
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:32,613
They fight, they aggress,

320
00:22:32,613 --> 00:22:34,613
they go to other countries,

321
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:37,613
aggress them, capture them,

322
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:40,613
all the time they are thinking of aggressing others.

323
00:22:40,613 --> 00:22:42,613
In a subtler way they aggress,

324
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:45,613
nowadays the media is aggressive in the West.

325
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,613
There are so many ways of aggression

326
00:22:49,613 --> 00:22:55,613
and to them aggression is something is very dharmic.

327
00:22:55,613 --> 00:22:57,613
For anything.

328
00:22:57,613 --> 00:23:00,613
They’ll ask direct questions,

329
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:06,613
arrogant, insulting and cruel,

330
00:23:08,613 --> 00:23:09,613
they become cruel.

331
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:15,613
That’s how the turmoil starts

332
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:18,613
when we start using the power of Saraswati

333
00:23:18,613 --> 00:23:21,613
in a wrong way or the power of Mahakali.

334
00:23:27,613 --> 00:23:31,613
That’s why in Sahaja Yoga before the Puja

335
00:23:31,613 --> 00:23:33,613
we have to go into lot of activity.

336
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:35,613
You have to decorate the hall,

337
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:38,613
you have to get the flowers,

338
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:41,613
you have to organize everything beautifully.

339
00:23:42,613 --> 00:23:45,613
Look at the roses, how beautiful they are.

340
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:48,613
Then you starts balancing yourself

341
00:23:48,613 --> 00:23:51,613
with all these activities you do.

342
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:59,613
And then you sit down for puja.

343
00:23:59,613 --> 00:24:02,613
That’s like in the daytime you work,

344
00:24:02,613 --> 00:24:03,613
in the night you sleep.

345
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:08,613
To rest, to get the place: you must be active.

346
00:24:11,613 --> 00:24:13,613
Like they have to climb Himalayas

347
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:16,613
to achieve meditation,

348
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:19,613
because when you are tired,

349
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:23,613
you can be restful afterwards.

350
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:25,613
Otherwise, if you get somebody,

351
00:24:25,613 --> 00:24:27,613
say, from Switzerland only,

352
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:33,613
the very speedy person for meditation,

353
00:24:33,613 --> 00:24:36,613
you’ll have to put the glue on him

354
00:24:37,613 --> 00:24:40,613
to settle down because he’ll be frantic, you know,

355
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:44,613
all the time. Will be all the time jumping!

356
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:56,613
So the activity has to come before the puja

357
00:24:58,613 --> 00:25:00,613
and the balance has to be established.

358
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:03,613
So the ladies have to find out the saris

359
00:25:03,613 --> 00:25:05,613
and the blouses and this and that

360
00:25:05,613 --> 00:25:07,613
and they have to worry about putting the flowers,

361
00:25:07,613 --> 00:25:10,613
arranging things, this, that. Lot of activities!

362
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:14,613
We have to travel.

363
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,613
For English it was necessary to travel all the way from England,

364
00:25:17,613 --> 00:25:20,613
to arrange their money and rooms and everything to come here,

365
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:27,613
to go to futuristic side, to think what they are going to pay,

366
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:30,613
how they are going to pay back their loans!

367
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:40,613
All this futuristic: planning they have to do before they come to Switzerland.

368
00:25:42,613 --> 00:25:49,613
Switzerland being the most active place, it’s better to have the puja here, so they are not so much active!

369
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:54,613
That’s how the Devi arranges everything.

370
00:25:57,613 --> 00:26:01,613
So the ascent starts evolving.

371
00:26:03,613 --> 00:26:10,613
In that, the play of the Devi is the Navaratri – in your ascent – from ages.

372
00:26:10,613 --> 00:26:15,613
Navaratri: that’s why is the most important Puja.

373
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:21,613
In Sahaja Yoga, Navaratri is the most important puja.

374
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:28,613
Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahastrar Day is, because that’s how you started getting your Realisation.

375
00:26:28,613 --> 00:26:33,613
But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution

376
00:26:34,613 --> 00:26:42,613
you’ll find [that] Navaratri is the one which has brought you to Sahastrara.

377
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:47,613
Without the help of the Devi at different stages of your ascent,

378
00:26:47,613 --> 00:26:53,613
you could not have been in a position to receive your Realisation.

379
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:59,613
So all the steps that you took in the past are today worshipped

380
00:27:00,613 --> 00:27:08,613
and are used for thanking the Devi for what She did to bring you down here.

381
00:27:08,613 --> 00:27:09,613
So it’s like a thanksgiving.

382
00:27:10,613 --> 00:27:15,613
Without Her work nothing could have happened.

383
00:27:15,613 --> 00:27:19,613
So, when we read about the Devi, about Her incarnations:

384
00:27:19,613 --> 00:27:23,613
how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas,

385
00:27:23,613 --> 00:27:32,613
people who were trying to ascend, to cross this bhavasagara,

386
00:27:33,613 --> 00:27:36,613
how She worked hard,

387
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,613
how she fought the devils,

388
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:45,613
how She fought, She killed the demons single-handed,

389
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:52,613
She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the bhavasagara.

390
00:27:53,613 --> 00:27:58,613
Guru gave you the strength to have dharma, but She is the one who brought you out.

391
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:02,613
Even those who were dharmic could not do it because of the demonic pressure.

392
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:09,613
She’s the One who fought single-handed with Her powers of destruction.

393
00:28:10,613 --> 00:28:13,613
In Her love for you She fought.

394
00:28:13,613 --> 00:28:15,613
She brought you to this level.

395
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:20,613
And then She took a milder form of incarnation.

396
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:24,613
Even during the time of all the gurus,

397
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:34,613
She took the form of, as you know, Janaki was the daughter of Janaka,

398
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:41,613
then Fatima was the daughter of Mohammed Sahib

399
00:28:41,613 --> 00:28:44,613
and Nanaki was the sister of Nanaka.

400
00:28:44,613 --> 00:28:57,613
In those forms, these Powers sustained and nourished the Guru Tattwa.

401
00:28:57,613 --> 00:29:04,613
And later on, or sometimes simultaneously,

402
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:16,613
They incarnated in milder forms to help human beings to rise.

403
00:29:16,613 --> 00:29:19,613
So, today is the day of thanksgiving.

404
00:29:20,613 --> 00:29:24,613
As Guru Puja is a day of thanksgiving to your Guru,

405
00:29:24,613 --> 00:29:26,613
the One who has counselled you,

406
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:30,613
the One who has told you about the Truth,

407
00:29:30,613 --> 00:29:37,613
the One who has taught you the Truth and has given you Realisation.

408
00:29:38,613 --> 00:29:43,613
And the Devi puja is a thanksgiving where, single-handed,

409
00:29:45,613 --> 00:29:49,613
just like a very loving mother, under Her sari,

410
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:58,613
She protected you, fought for you, fought with every enemy that is around,

411
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:04,613
every sort of problems that existed

412
00:30:04,613 --> 00:30:11,613
and ultimately brought you into Sahastrara level and then gave you Realisation.

413
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:15,613
It’s a real thanksgiving to the Mother.

414
00:30:17,613 --> 00:30:23,613
So, we can say Navaratri is like a Mother’s Day where you give thanksgiving to Her:

415
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:30,613
which was just relentless, continuous working for Her children.

416
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:39,613
Motherhood is much more important than the guruhood.

417
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:45,613
Because guru is the one who trains you, makes you efficient.

418
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:48,613
But the Mother forgives you,

419
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:53,613
She loves you, She sustains you and She teaches you how to love.

420
00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:59,613
She has tremendous patience and tremendous, love and She does it single-handed.

421
00:30:59,613 --> 00:31:03,613
She doesn’t expect anything from you – absolutely selfless.

422
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:11,613
'Selfless’ is a very small word I should say, it’s such an expansive compassion

423
00:31:11,613 --> 00:31:21,613
which engulfs everything that is wrong, dissolves it, digest it, absorbs it.

424
00:31:23,613 --> 00:31:28,613
So, it’s a very great day Navaratri is, for all the Sahaja Yogis,

425
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:41,613
because then She took Her form as Sita, as the Power of Shri Rama, silent potential,

426
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:47,613
suffering. How much She suffered! How much She suffered!

427
00:31:49,613 --> 00:31:52,613
Then She took the form of Radha.

428
00:31:53,613 --> 00:32:01,613
Then She came as five powers of Saraswati as the five wives of Shri Krishna.

429
00:32:03,613 --> 00:32:10,613
Then She came as Mary: that was the greatest suffering, I think, to see the Son being crucified.

430
00:32:10,613 --> 00:32:16,613
The suffering, silent, patient suffering, She had to go through it.

431
00:32:17,613 --> 00:32:20,613
All that drama, to be seen, was too much.

432
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:26,613
She went through all that because you all had to cross your Agya Chakra.

433
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,613
She had to sacrifice Her Child.

434
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,613
It’s easy for a father to do that, very difficult for a mother.

435
00:32:33,613 --> 00:32:39,613
Now you are all mothers, so many of you, you will know what it is to have a child

436
00:32:39,613 --> 00:32:42,613
and how one feels about it.

437
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:47,613
After doing that,

438
00:32:47,613 --> 00:32:53,613
She comes to the state where you have to give your Realisation.

439
00:32:53,613 --> 00:32:56,913
Is a work of tremendous patience, as you know.

440
00:32:56,913 --> 00:33:00,613
It’s tremendous patience and understanding.

441
00:33:00,613 --> 00:33:08,613
Human beings, as the time advanced, have evolved no doubt for Realisation,

442
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:14,613
but also evolved to very funny, stupid, crooked nonsensical ways.

443
00:33:14,613 --> 00:33:20,613
It’s impossible to understand how they go about with their stupid ideas

444
00:33:20,613 --> 00:33:22,613
and how troublesome they can be!

445
00:33:22,613 --> 00:33:27,613
They can be very crooked, funny, troublesome

446
00:33:27,613 --> 00:33:33,613
to such an extent that sometimes even it is difficult to forgive.

447
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:41,613
Despite that so many of you are here today, in Europe,

448
00:33:41,613 --> 00:33:47,613
in the land of the Guru, here I find, who have got Realisation.

449
00:33:47,613 --> 00:33:54,613
So, the Mother’s pride, Mother’s joy knows no bounds,no doubt about it.

450
00:33:54,613 --> 00:33:57,613
It’s such a great thing to see Her children

451
00:33:57,613 --> 00:34:03,613
sitting here to receive all the powers from Her.

452
00:34:04,613 --> 00:34:08,613
Now, again, when we are in this situation,

453
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:14,613
we have to know the first principle with which the whole thing started:

454
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:18,613
that it is the power of love.

455
00:34:21,613 --> 00:34:27,613
It is the power of love that has brought you to this state

456
00:34:27,613 --> 00:34:33,613
and it’s the power of love that you will express and manifest; you will evolve.

457
00:34:35,613 --> 00:34:42,613
Now, after coming to Sahaja Yoga also the temptations become subtler and subtler.

458
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:50,613
We try to do Sahaj Yog, we try to spread Sahaja Yoga, sometimes for the powers .

459
00:34:50,613 --> 00:34:53,613
Maybe you are lonely, so you want to have more Sahaja Yogis.

460
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:59,613
Maybe you do it because you think that, that’s how you spread your powers.

461
00:34:59,613 --> 00:35:04,613
Even there are problems on leadership I find, ego problems there are.

462
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:08,613
Somebody’s appointed a leader then another feels bad, this, that all goes on.

463
00:35:08,613 --> 00:35:13,613
I see the drama going on. Like small children they fight. What is this leadership?

464
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:17,613
Is just artificial! It’s not even noted in any newspaper!

465
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:28,613
As they have mock governments we have a mock leadership.

466
00:35:30,613 --> 00:35:34,613
So, then people fight for that – this becomes subtler.

467
00:35:34,613 --> 00:35:37,613
The power struggle goes on becoming subtler and subtler.

468
00:35:40,613 --> 00:35:46,613
Then again money problems come up. Some people think that

469
00:35:46,613 --> 00:35:49,613
Sahaja Yoga is a very big way of making money.

470
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:53,613
Or some people think that, “We can get lot of money, because

471
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:58,613
Mother blesses people with money, affluence, so let us be in Sahaja Yoga,”

472
00:35:58,613 --> 00:36:00,613
but don’t spend a single pai, you see,

473
00:36:00,613 --> 00:36:07,613
just manage it. No! It’s not like that. It’s the other way round!

474
00:36:10,613 --> 00:36:13,613
It’s again the another dilemma is there that,

475
00:36:13,613 --> 00:36:23,613
in India which is a place of poverty compare to all of you, everyone donates money.

476
00:36:23,613 --> 00:36:29,613
All the trustees in every centre wherever there are trustees,

477
00:36:29,613 --> 00:36:34,613
have to donate at least five thousand rupees to become the trustees.

478
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:38,613
Of course, I don’t get anything out of it,

479
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,513
but I must have donated I don’t know how many how much Myself

480
00:36:42,513 --> 00:36:45,613
to become the Trustee of Sahaja Yogis!

481
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,913
But you have to donate.

482
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:58,913
And when you become miserly again that means, again, it’s the same thing going on.

483
00:37:00,913 --> 00:37:05,913
You have bank balances, but the source is finished and you have nothing left.

484
00:37:06,913 --> 00:37:10,913
The bank balance should be with God.

485
00:37:10,913 --> 00:37:15,913
Then He gives you interest more than the capital.

486
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:18,913
Is there any bank which does that?

487
00:37:21,913 --> 00:37:25,913
At least not the Swiss Bank!

488
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,913
You have to pay for keeping money with them.

489
00:37:34,913 --> 00:37:43,913
That’s how it is. You should tap . Always try to go to the source.

490
00:37:46,913 --> 00:37:51,913
This becomes subtler and subtler in the sense

491
00:37:51,913 --> 00:37:55,913
that people think that now their children are realized souls.

492
00:37:56,913 --> 00:38:00,913
All right, so what? They are not Gods, are they?

493
00:38:00,913 --> 00:38:05,913
They get so involved with their children, I mean, this is another stupidity women fall into.

494
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:10,913
But to them their child is so important,

495
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,913
they get so adhered to the child.

496
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:17,913
I mean, first they used to neglect the children, now they become so attached to their children

497
00:38:17,913 --> 00:38:21,913
that they look like glued people all the time.

498
00:38:23,913 --> 00:38:28,913
And such children cannot grow properly unless and until you give them freedom.

499
00:38:29,913 --> 00:38:32,913
Give them full freedom to grow.

500
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:41,913
But guidance, of course, that they are majestic people, meaning Sahaja Yogis,

501
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:46,913
they are born realised as a Sahaja Yogi, as a good Sahaja Yogi how they should behave.

502
00:38:46,913 --> 00:38:51,913
Have a rapport, talk to them, tell them about it, how they be.

503
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:56,913
Develop that self-respect within them that they should be like this.

504
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:58,913
Not to glue them to you.

505
00:39:02,913 --> 00:39:06,913
That’s not the way. Children will never grow properly, even physically,

506
00:39:06,913 --> 00:39:08,913
if you glue them to yourself.

507
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:15,913
In the West now I see new ideas coming up that the children must be glued to the mother.

508
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:21,913
This is from one extreme to another extreme.They’ll become very left-sided.

509
00:39:21,913 --> 00:39:26,913
Even if they’ll be grown up in age they won’t grow up in their brains.

510
00:39:26,913 --> 00:39:30,913
They won’t grow up in their behaviour if they are glued with the mother.

511
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:35,913
If they cry for a while, little bit, doesn’t matter,

512
00:39:35,913 --> 00:39:39,913
but the children must be made to sleep away from the mother.

513
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:44,913
All the time you should not carry your children in your lap. There is no need at all.

514
00:39:45,913 --> 00:39:51,913
But this is not that the child wants, is the mother who wants this kind of a thing.

515
00:39:53,913 --> 00:40:00,913
And some fathers also I have seen glue down to their children

516
00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:08,913
and then they say, “Mother, my child is spoiled, he’s like this, like that.”

517
00:40:08,913 --> 00:40:13,913
Such children will get possessed very fast if you make the children dependant on you.

518
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:16,913
Very fast they’ll become possessed.

519
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:20,913
If you make them over-independent, “You are on your own”,

520
00:40:20,913 --> 00:40:23,913
like the other side was that when we were in Oxted

521
00:40:23,913 --> 00:40:28,913
a girl of seven years used to come and give us newspapers.

522
00:40:28,913 --> 00:40:31,913
And she was a daughter of a lord!

523
00:40:31,913 --> 00:40:36,913
At about five o’clock in the morning, in that cold she used to climb up all the way

524
00:40:36,913 --> 00:40:40,913
on a bicycle delivering those newspapers.

525
00:40:40,913 --> 00:40:43,913
And when I told her mother, “What are you doing? It’s very dangerous,

526
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:46,913
this child is in danger, she is a girl, how can you do that to her?”

527
00:40:46,913 --> 00:40:49,913
she said, “No, no, she has to be on her own.”

528
00:40:51,913 --> 00:40:57,913
So, the one side is to be on her own and another side is to glue them,

529
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:02,913
is again the same subtle attitude of possessiveness. It’s possessiveness,

530
00:41:02,913 --> 00:41:08,913
"This is my child, I must look after the child, the child is self-realised soul, this, that.”

531
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:14,913
Only your child is not realised soul, everybody’s child is the realised soul in Sahaja Yoga.

532
00:41:14,913 --> 00:41:17,913
How much do you do for other’s children?

533
00:41:17,913 --> 00:41:20,913
Or only you look after your own child?

534
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,913
The custom should be: if you buy one thing for your child,

535
00:41:26,913 --> 00:41:30,913
buy two more things for another child.

536
00:41:30,913 --> 00:41:35,913
Buy better things for another child and less things for your child.

537
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:43,913
Let your child share his things with others.

538
00:41:44,913 --> 00:41:48,913
At the time when you are buying something, buy something that he can share.

539
00:41:48,913 --> 00:41:50,913
Teach him how to share.

540
00:41:50,913 --> 00:41:56,913
Because though they are realised souls, with the mothers and the fathers like this

541
00:41:56,913 --> 00:42:01,913
they’ll become again the same miserly old-style people:

542
00:42:03,913 --> 00:42:09,913
quarrelsome, fighting, beating each other, troubling each other.

543
00:42:09,913 --> 00:42:11,913
So be careful .

544
00:42:11,913 --> 00:42:22,913
Being realised-souls, you will be surprised, they will be extremely, extremely convenient for you.

545
00:42:22,913 --> 00:42:25,913
Give them to other Sahaja Yogis to handle, depend on them,

546
00:42:25,913 --> 00:42:27,913
let them look after.

547
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:34,913
And the homogeneous feeling comes through children. Children are the ones who bind each other.

548
00:42:34,913 --> 00:42:38,913
But, “Don’t touch my child! This is my child!”

549
00:42:38,913 --> 00:42:41,913
you close the door as soon as somebody comes in.

550
00:42:42,913 --> 00:42:46,913
That’s you are going back in the same way as your mothers have been.

551
00:42:47,913 --> 00:42:50,913
There’s no war on in Sahaja Yoga.

552
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:55,913
We are in the government of God.

553
00:42:56,913 --> 00:42:59,913
This realisation has to come.

554
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:04,913
There is no need to seek all these useless things, these pleasures of life.

555
00:43:05,913 --> 00:43:10,913
Understand your responsibility

556
00:43:10,913 --> 00:43:16,913
that you are Sahaja Yogis first and last and, in the middle

557
00:43:18,913 --> 00:43:22,913
and as Sahaja Yogis what is your duty?

558
00:43:22,913 --> 00:43:28,913
Is to be completely dedicated for the betterment and the benevolence of others.

559
00:43:30,913 --> 00:43:34,913
That’s the only thing which is going to nourish you to rise.

560
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:38,913
If you look after your children like this, like mad, it’s not going to help you .

561
00:43:38,913 --> 00:43:40,913
You’ll have problems.

562
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:43,913
If you neglect your children, you will have problems.

563
00:43:46,913 --> 00:43:53,913
So come in the centre and be just witnesses of all that.

564
00:43:57,913 --> 00:44:03,913
It’s a very common failing in the beginning of every Sahaja Yogi who comes to Sahaja Yoga.

565
00:44:03,913 --> 00:44:09,913
They’ll send me the list of five generations on this side and five generations on this side

566
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:20,913
"my fathers, brothers, sisters, this thing, that thing, real cousins, real this thing is sick.

567
00:44:20,913 --> 00:44:23,913
So please, Mother, put Your attention.”

568
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:27,913
And when I put my attention, the attention returns back, I can’t find that.

569
00:44:29,913 --> 00:44:35,913
It starts like that to begin with. Alright, in the beginning I say, “Alright, just now they have entered.”

570
00:44:35,913 --> 00:44:39,913
"But you don’t know", these are tentacles which keep you down,

571
00:44:39,913 --> 00:44:45,913
they do not allow you to rise in the domain of God.

572
00:44:45,913 --> 00:44:51,913
In the domain of God everything that is yours, even your hair,

573
00:44:51,913 --> 00:44:54,913
are looked after by God Almighty.

574
00:44:54,913 --> 00:45:00,913
Every thing! Can you understand that? Can you realise that?

575
00:45:00,913 --> 00:45:11,913
Is all done by billions and billions and billions of powers of Adi Shakti.

576
00:45:16,913 --> 00:45:22,913
What can you do yourself? Nothing! Except for worrying and troubling.

577
00:45:22,913 --> 00:45:31,913
So just if you believe and assume that power today

578
00:45:31,913 --> 00:45:35,913
that you are in the domain of God,

579
00:45:36,913 --> 00:45:40,913
which is active benevolence,

580
00:45:40,913 --> 00:45:45,913
the nature of it is active benevolence

581
00:45:46,913 --> 00:45:48,913
as we say ‘hita’  (हित).

582
00:45:53,913 --> 00:45:57,913
If you are sick, it is for your benevolence.

583
00:45:57,913 --> 00:46:00,913
If you are alright, it is for your benevolence.

584
00:46:00,913 --> 00:46:06,913
If you have money, it is for your benevolence. If you don’t have money, it is for your benevolence.

585
00:46:10,913 --> 00:46:15,913
Everything does good for you in the domain of God.

586
00:46:15,913 --> 00:46:22,913
Do not judge it according to your own standards.

587
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:29,913
Whom do you think to be a person who is benevolent in this world apart from Me?

588
00:46:31,913 --> 00:46:33,913
Really, in the real sense of the word?

589
00:46:34,913 --> 00:46:38,913
Supposing you take a man who is very rich;

590
00:46:38,913 --> 00:46:40,913
is he benevolent?

591
00:46:41,913 --> 00:46:47,913
No. Is he happy? No. Is he respected? No.

592
00:46:51,913 --> 00:46:57,913
At least he has to be a realised soul to be somewhere near that description.

593
00:46:59,913 --> 00:47:03,913
And if you have to ascend in the domain of God,

594
00:47:03,913 --> 00:47:07,913
you have to know that everything works through His power:

595
00:47:07,913 --> 00:47:16,913
your activity, your inactivity, your sleep, everything is worked through His powers of love.

596
00:47:16,913 --> 00:47:21,913
Love can never harm, can never destroy.

597
00:47:21,913 --> 00:47:24,913
You go a little ahead with it

598
00:47:27,913 --> 00:47:33,913
and it showers flowers upon you.

599
00:47:35,913 --> 00:47:42,913
But understand your nature: supposing you are a left-sided person.

600
00:47:42,913 --> 00:47:46,913
Mostly I’ve seen left sided persons always want to do my pujas.

601
00:47:46,913 --> 00:47:51,913
And the right-sided person are organising. Do the other way round.

602
00:47:51,913 --> 00:47:59,913
must know your nature, give yourself a balance, and then enter into the Kingdom of God.

603
00:47:59,913 --> 00:48:04,913
Like you entering into a door, say for example,

604
00:48:04,913 --> 00:48:07,913
and you have too much load on your back,

605
00:48:07,913 --> 00:48:09,913
meaning you are a left-sided person.

606
00:48:09,913 --> 00:48:16,913
Then take down the load from your back on your head and enter in.

607
00:48:16,913 --> 00:48:23,913
But if you have too much on your head, put it on your back and enter in.

608
00:48:23,913 --> 00:48:26,913
Because you’re tired. You do it every day.

609
00:48:26,913 --> 00:48:30,913
Supposing this hand is tired, you put it on the left hand.

610
00:48:30,913 --> 00:48:35,913
I see in aeroplane when people are walking, they are holding it in one hand

611
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,913
and automatically when it is tired, they put it to the left – automatically.

612
00:48:39,913 --> 00:48:41,913
They are not Sahaja Yogis!

613
00:48:42,913 --> 00:48:48,913
In the same way in life also, if you have done one-sidedness too much,

614
00:48:48,913 --> 00:48:53,913
try to do the other side and give yourself a balance.

615
00:48:55,913 --> 00:49:00,913
Navaratri is the day to give you the balance.

616
00:49:01,913 --> 00:49:08,913
Those whose right hand is tired will get the power in the left hand.

617
00:49:08,913 --> 00:49:17,913
Those who have the left hand tired will get the power on the right hand to share the load.

618
00:49:18,913 --> 00:49:26,913
So those who are having money problems will solve their money problems.

619
00:49:27,913 --> 00:49:33,913
And those who have sleeping problems will solve their sleeping problems.

620
00:49:33,913 --> 00:49:38,913
But one can say if somebody has both, then what do they do?

621
00:49:38,913 --> 00:49:44,913
I know of somebody, I lived there, in that country

622
00:49:44,913 --> 00:49:49,913
where they have both the problems, they sleep as well as they have no money, and they are not bothered!

623
00:50:04,913 --> 00:50:07,913
So, for such people what should we do?

624
00:50:07,913 --> 00:50:12,913
Of course, I won’t tell you, but one has to do something about it!

625
00:50:19,913 --> 00:50:22,913
One has to work out something.

626
00:50:25,913 --> 00:50:27,913
They just don’t move

627
00:50:27,913 --> 00:50:33,913
and if you tell them, answer is, “I know. I know I sleep a lot;

628
00:50:33,913 --> 00:50:37,913
I know I’m like this. I know. I know.”

629
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:40,913
That’s all. Then what do you say?

630
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:46,913
It stops you completely. You can’t go further. If they know, what more to be told?

631
00:50:50,913 --> 00:51:00,913
This is a complete mountain there standing just to finish you completely.

632
00:51:09,913 --> 00:51:12,913
So, one has to do.

633
00:51:14,913 --> 00:51:16,913
Everyone has to do something.

634
00:51:16,913 --> 00:51:18,913
Somebody is working it out,

635
00:51:18,913 --> 00:51:22,713
somebody is doing some work,

636
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:24,713
and another is not helping.

637
00:51:24,713 --> 00:51:31,713
Then that cannot be completed, it’s a collective work, you cannot! One person cannot do it.

638
00:51:32,713 --> 00:51:37,713
I’ve seen it happens like this. It’s a collective work.

639
00:51:37,713 --> 00:51:43,713
So, we come to the position that Navaratri today is not the work of Mother only,

640
00:51:43,713 --> 00:51:47,713
which She did so far, is the work of every one of you.

641
00:51:48,713 --> 00:51:50,713
I cannot do it single-handed.

642
00:51:52,713 --> 00:51:55,713
If I could, there was no need for you to be here,

643
00:51:55,713 --> 00:52:00,713
I would have built the aeroplane, put you there, pushed them some or other, lock it up and put you there.

644
00:52:00,713 --> 00:52:02,713
It’s not possible.

645
00:52:03,713 --> 00:52:06,713
You all have to carry your own aeroplanes.

646
00:52:06,713 --> 00:52:10,713
Build it up and carry it yourself with dignity,

647
00:52:10,713 --> 00:52:13,713
not like small children. So, you have to mature.

648
00:52:14,713 --> 00:52:19,713
And for that maturity it’s a collective thing that has to take place.

649
00:52:19,713 --> 00:52:23,713
In the beginning in the school, alright, they’ll teach you two plus two is equal to four.

650
00:52:23,713 --> 00:52:27,713
But when you go to the college, you have to do it yourself,

651
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:31,713
solve the problem yourself.

652
00:52:31,713 --> 00:52:39,713
And that’s what it is today. Sahaja Yoga is good, you get your Realisation in these modern times,

653
00:52:39,713 --> 00:52:43,713
but the maturity has to take place,

654
00:52:43,713 --> 00:52:45,713
otherwise useless.

655
00:52:45,713 --> 00:52:53,713
Up to the seed it was alright, but once it is sprouted it must become the tree, otherwise it’s useless.

656
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,713
And that all of you have to do together,

657
00:52:57,713 --> 00:53:00,713
helping each other, understanding each other.

658
00:53:00,713 --> 00:53:04,713
And everyone has to work it out.

659
00:53:04,713 --> 00:53:07,713
Even if one person suffers, I suffer.

660
00:53:12,713 --> 00:53:16,713
The whole thing has become collective.

661
00:53:18,713 --> 00:53:21,713
The Devi has become collective.

662
00:53:23,713 --> 00:53:26,713
It’s a venture.

663
00:53:28,713 --> 00:53:33,713
It’s a venture, I know, too much of it. There was no other way out.

664
00:53:33,713 --> 00:53:41,713
It’s like crucifixion of every part of Your body, every cell of Your body.

665
00:53:44,713 --> 00:53:46,713
But it’s alright.

666
00:53:49,713 --> 00:53:53,713
So today, instead of feeling guilty,

667
00:53:53,713 --> 00:53:59,713
you should be filled with tremendous courage and tremendous enthusiasm:

668
00:53:59,713 --> 00:54:04,713
that we have to do it, because Mother has given us the power.

669
00:54:04,713 --> 00:54:07,713
We can do it; nothing should keep us down.

670
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:10,713
And we are going to help each other.

671
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:16,713
One person is doing one job, nobody will look at it, you see, they won’t just move!

672
00:54:16,713 --> 00:54:21,713
"I know, I’m sitting down, I know. I don’t do anything I know.”

673
00:54:25,713 --> 00:54:28,713
And in Sahaja Yoga, it has become even subtler,

674
00:54:28,713 --> 00:54:32,713
"I want to do but there’s a bhoot in me which doesn’t allow me to do it.”

675
00:54:34,713 --> 00:54:36,713
So, you get out with your bhoot!

676
00:54:37,713 --> 00:54:39,713
That’s what it is.

677
00:54:41,713 --> 00:54:51,713
All these arguments are stupid, of no value in Sahaja Yoga.

678
00:54:51,713 --> 00:54:55,713
That means you have not understood the meaning of Sahaja Yoga,

679
00:54:55,713 --> 00:55:01,713
you have not understood the meaning of yourself, and you have no respect for your life.

680
00:55:01,713 --> 00:55:02,713
That’s what it is.

681
00:55:02,713 --> 00:55:06,713
If you indulge into such thinking, then it is no good.

682
00:55:06,713 --> 00:55:11,713
But today you have to promise to yourself and to me within your heart

683
00:55:12,713 --> 00:55:17,713
that you are going to be filled with that enthusiasm and that shakti.

684
00:55:19,713 --> 00:55:22,713
The time has come.

685
00:55:28,713 --> 00:55:33,713
Which is going to make you real yogis.

686
00:55:36,713 --> 00:55:38,713
Complete dedication.

687
00:55:38,713 --> 00:55:44,713
Imagine these PLO people what they are doing, fearlessly.

688
00:55:44,713 --> 00:55:46,713
I mean, all kinds of people you see around you

689
00:55:46,713 --> 00:55:49,713
even in Kali Yuga are so dedicated to something nonsensical.

690
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:53,713
Why can’t we be dedicated to something so sensible?

691
00:55:57,713 --> 00:56:00,713
They are not afraid of anything,

692
00:56:00,713 --> 00:56:03,713
they are dare devils.

693
00:56:03,713 --> 00:56:05,713
Why can’t we become like that?

694
00:56:06,713 --> 00:56:09,713
What’s wrong with us?

695
00:56:10,713 --> 00:56:17,713
So every one of us must have that enthusiasm and “I’m an institution by myself.

696
00:56:17,713 --> 00:56:22,713
And I’m going to do it, I’m not going to take advantage of the ashram life,

697
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:26,713
nicely settled down in the ashram. You see very good, cheap.”

698
00:56:26,713 --> 00:56:30,713
No! We are all going to move out also

699
00:56:30,713 --> 00:56:33,713
and take up a place somewhere else.

700
00:56:33,713 --> 00:56:35,713
For the time being ashram is alright.

701
00:56:35,713 --> 00:56:38,713
But then give more room to others who are coming.

702
00:56:38,713 --> 00:56:42,713
You get out of it. Go out and stay somewhere and work it out.

703
00:56:44,713 --> 00:56:48,713
Then in the ashram, “This is my house, I have spent money for this,

704
00:56:48,713 --> 00:56:52,713
this is my furniture, this is this thing, that thing.”

705
00:56:55,713 --> 00:57:03,713
Actually, you should know how to live on a string, shoestring, as they say, on a shoestring.

706
00:57:03,713 --> 00:57:09,713
Of course, now I’m feeling that every ashram has such a lot of furniture that they had to [UNCLEAR bring].

707
00:57:10,713 --> 00:57:13,713
Better live on a shoestring.

708
00:57:13,713 --> 00:57:19,713
So the tapasya starts.

709
00:57:19,713 --> 00:57:22,713
Go into a penance yourself.

710
00:57:22,713 --> 00:57:27,713
But then I will hear, “Mother, I’m on a tapasya, I’m eating only once.”

711
00:57:27,713 --> 00:57:32,713
Why? Who ask you to be on tapasya? Enjoy! Enjoy your tapasya!

712
00:57:32,713 --> 00:57:35,713
Then it is Sahaja, otherwise: nonsense.

713
00:57:35,713 --> 00:57:39,713
Enjoy. If you can enjoy your tapasya then you are sahaj;

714
00:57:39,713 --> 00:57:43,713
With enthusiasm. Look at these PLOs,

715
00:57:44,713 --> 00:57:47,713
look at these people,

716
00:57:49,713 --> 00:57:55,713
do they say, "We are going in a tapasya”? Nothing.

717
00:57:56,713 --> 00:57:59,713
You have examples of people around you.

718
00:58:00,713 --> 00:58:03,713
But we can’t say  they are possessed by bhoots.

719
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:09,713
Or even if they are what about you? You better get possessed by sahaj bhoots for a change!

720
00:58:11,713 --> 00:58:15,713
If that’s the way, only, you can be motivated.

721
00:58:21,713 --> 00:58:27,713
So, tell your mind, “No explanations, nothing doing. I am going to show my worth!”

722
00:58:35,713 --> 00:58:40,713
But all the time if the attention is just to show off

723
00:58:40,713 --> 00:58:44,713
or to be in my attention

724
00:58:45,713 --> 00:58:52,713
or to be in contact with me, to be writing to me or something, is not going to help at all.

725
00:58:57,713 --> 00:59:03,713
I am just a mirror, and you see within myself yourself, in the true way.

726
00:59:03,713 --> 00:59:09,713
And also, this mirror, is full of maya.

727
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:19,713
So, a devil may look into this mirror and may look like a saint to him.

728
00:59:19,713 --> 00:59:23,713
If he has ego, he might look like a saint to himself.

729
00:59:25,713 --> 00:59:36,713
Or if he is a left-sided person he might think he is the incarnation of Bhairava – he might.

730
00:59:40,713 --> 00:59:50,713
But if he is truthful, he can see clearly that he is the highest of highest, he's a sahaja yogi

731
00:59:50,713 --> 00:59:56,713
And unless and until you see yourself like that, know that it’s a maya.

732
01:00:01,713 --> 01:00:08,713
So, to realise that you have achieved a lot by getting your Realisation,

733
01:00:08,713 --> 01:00:12,713
of rising so much higher above all these petty ideas.

734
01:00:12,713 --> 01:00:17,713
Every idea is petty, whether it is economics, politics, philosophy,

735
01:00:17,713 --> 01:00:21,713
any ism, anything is all petty for a Sahaja Yogi,

736
01:00:24,713 --> 01:00:30,713
because none of them know even this much about God’s domain.

737
01:00:30,713 --> 01:00:33,713
What are they talking about is economics!

738
01:00:37,713 --> 01:00:40,713
They do not know anything about His politics.

739
01:00:42,713 --> 01:00:47,713
They do not know anything that there is a miraculous power

740
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:50,713
which rules the whole Universe,

741
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:56,713
and which is so efficient. Which never fails.

742
01:00:57,713 --> 01:01:03,713
So timely, so sensible, so interesting, dramatic.

743
01:01:03,713 --> 01:01:08,713
See how we reserved all these things in no time.

744
01:01:08,713 --> 01:01:13,713
How we got to this place. I was to have this puja here.

745
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:16,713
All this you know. How I came here.

746
01:01:16,713 --> 01:01:21,713
See the miracle working. How the powers of the Divine are working.

747
01:01:21,713 --> 01:01:23,713
You be the proper instrument of the Divine.

748
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:26,713
And it has another force as I told you

749
01:01:26,713 --> 01:01:30,713
centripetal and centrifugal – and you might be thrown out.

750
01:01:32,713 --> 01:01:38,713
So be careful on that point. Face yourself in truthfulness!

751
01:01:38,713 --> 01:01:42,713
Do not get pampered by your ego or morosed  by your superego!

752
01:01:42,713 --> 01:01:47,713
Just see for yourself as a powerful instrument of love.

753
01:01:47,713 --> 01:01:50,713
But in love you do not become indiscrete.

754
01:01:52,713 --> 01:02:00,713
Steadily, beautifully, gently you attend to it.

755
01:02:02,713 --> 01:02:08,713
And so much power can be born.

756
01:02:08,713 --> 01:02:13,713
You will be amazed that water, which looks something so frivolous to us,

757
01:02:13,713 --> 01:02:16,713
has so much power in it.

758
01:02:17,713 --> 01:02:19,713
You know about hydrostatics.

759
01:02:22,713 --> 01:02:26,713
This Mother Earth which looks so simple:

760
01:02:26,713 --> 01:02:31,713
We walk on Her on our feet. She attracts us on ourself.

761
01:02:31,713 --> 01:02:34,713
She’s spinning with such a speed Herself,

762
01:02:34,713 --> 01:02:36,713
She keeps us sticking on to Her.

763
01:02:37,713 --> 01:02:42,713
She’s doing thousands and thousands of tremendous jobs,

764
01:02:42,713 --> 01:02:46,713
this great Mother Earth She looks so simple.

765
01:02:46,713 --> 01:02:54,713
She’s so powerful. In the same way you are made out of this Ganesha Tattwa which is so tremendous.

766
01:02:58,713 --> 01:03:02,713
This Navaratri should give you that power,

767
01:03:02,913 --> 01:03:08,713
those nine powers of nine chakras.

768
01:03:08,713 --> 01:03:13,713
Seven chakras: you already know.

769
01:03:13,713 --> 01:03:18,713
Above that you become the master yourself,

770
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:24,713
and then you become the Power yourself.

771
01:03:32,713 --> 01:03:34,713
May God bless you!
