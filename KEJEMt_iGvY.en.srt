1
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:11,650
then the deity disappears from them, all right?

2
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:14,170
The attention goes away from the place.

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,147
Then they bring the Satan there and play the havoc.

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,308
See these tantrikas have no relationship with our ancient Scriptures,

5
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:24,924
no relationship at all.

6
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,664
For example Rajneesh will never mention any one of our ancient Scriptures,

7
00:00:28,664 --> 00:00:29,814
nothing.

8
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:32,295
They have no relationship with any deities.

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,816
They have no relationship with

10
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:38,993
any great writers we have had, like Adi Shankaracharya.

11
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:40,516
Not a word.

12
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:47,152
Holiness is the basis of religion and spirituality.

13
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:51,562
In which Scripture this is written?

14
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:55,173
Does he mean to say that he is,

15
00:00:55,174 --> 00:00:58,865
he has nothing to do with Christ, nothing to do with God,

16
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:01,784
nothing to do with anyone, but only sex?

17
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:06,239
Deluded you people are really, why don’t you think are you only sex point?

18
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:08,962
So many things are written about it.

19
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,783
Because you people wanted.

20
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:13,403
Audience: (inaudible}

21
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,683
Where is it?

22
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:15,583
(Inaudible)

23
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:16,686
No. No, no, no, no.

24
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:17,783
There’s nothing about sex?

25
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:19,245
Not a word.

26
00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:20,388
(Questioner Inaudible)

27
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:21,397
No, no…

28
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:23,808
What?

29
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:26,481
You see that way these people have spoiled

30
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:30,981
even Ashwa Medha Yagna which was the…, such a great thing, you know.

31
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:34,787
They have used it for their own purpose saying that this is the symbol of this.

32
00:01:34,798 --> 00:01:38,234
Even Shiva and Shakti, nonsensical people call it sex.

33
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:40,784
How can you do that to God?

34
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:43,388
You sublimate into that, the greater thing.

35
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:44,594
What is sex?

36
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:48,085
Every Dick, Tom, Harry can do sex…

37
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:49,814
We are used to do it so…

38
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:50,825
Yes, then what?

39
00:01:50,905 --> 00:01:56,718
That’s why they are telling you to do it and, but if you do it in a wrong way you’ll have diseases,

40
00:01:56,737 --> 00:01:59,697
you’ll have impotency,

41
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:02,962
no children will be born to you if you misuse it.

42
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:08,205
There is a sanctity about it.

43
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,467
May I ask you a question?

44
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:09,985
Yes.

45
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,459
Do you say that one should never use sex?

46
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:13,788
No, no, one should.

47
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:15,278
One should be married.

48
00:02:15,338 --> 00:02:16,628
One should use sex.

49
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,015
It’s meant for a happy married life and for having children,

50
00:02:21,027 --> 00:02:24,096
and leading a very happy and a good life.

51
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:28,645
You must have a good sex life. You see, we do not think of sex at all in India.

52
00:02:28,643 --> 00:02:29,742
Never.

53
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:31,772
This is spontaneous.

54
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:34,582
You see, we never think of sex and all this nonsense.

55
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:36,269
We don’t read about it.

56
00:02:36,294 --> 00:02:42,677
I mean, I can tell you except for few anglicised and westernised Indians whom you meet,

57
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:45,895
you will hardly find anyone asking. Now they have met villagers.

58
00:02:45,903 --> 00:02:47,433
They don’t even think about sex,

59
00:02:47,503 --> 00:02:51,153
is a thing, relationship with the wife, very sacred relationship.

60
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:55,808
When you are with your wife, you see you indulge into it at an extreme point.

61
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:57,419
That’s all.

62
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:59,378
We do not sit and read about sex.

63
00:02:59,438 --> 00:03:04,014
Why should you read about it? This is spontaneous thing. Why should you read?

64
00:03:04,014 --> 00:03:05,044
I don’t read this.

65
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:05,835
That’s it.

66
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,034
But that’s what they are doing it.

67
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:13,094
This is another kind of Hitlerism.

68
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:17,465
I can tell you this is another kind of a cruelty to human beings.

69
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:21,106
See, you will be enticed absolutely;

70
00:03:21,104 --> 00:03:24,947
you would not find out, you will not know that this is a mistake.

71
00:03:24,935 --> 00:03:27,713
You’ll get into it and then you’ll realize it’s a mistake.

72
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:30,084
This is a destruction of your own being.

73
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,223
By wars you have destroyed others.

74
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:35,364
By this you will destroy yourself.

75
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:41,335
What I say has a bearing in the Bible,

76
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:42,905
has a bearing in Koran,

77
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:48,623
has a bearing in what you call any of the Scriptures, of Upanishads and all that,

78
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:50,683
every word of it,

79
00:03:50,693 --> 00:03:54,039
Gita and also of Adi Shankaracharya,

80
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,361
every word of it.

81
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:05,592
He has made forty crores of rupees.

82
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:07,502
This also you don’t understand

83
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:10,013
that he’s playing on your ego.

84
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:11,623
You think you can purchase him,

85
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:13,903
you can handle him.

86
00:04:13,924 --> 00:04:17,403
You don’t understand this, you see. He is too cunning for you.

87
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:24,492
But how can you explain that so many western people

88
00:04:24,502 --> 00:04:25,153
Mad!

89
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:27,673
went to him and go to him every time?

90
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:29,932
How can you explain so many Germans

91
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:33,142
wanted to kill thousands of people

92
00:04:33,223 --> 00:04:36,368
like so many of them were burnt alive

93
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:41,238
and put in the gas chamber? Do you, can you explain it?

94
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:45,170
Very easy to befool you people,

95
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,225
very easy.

96
00:04:46,214 --> 00:04:48,795
The trouble is you all think you are very clever.

97
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,324
You can be outwitted by a cleverer cunning fellow.

98
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,369
You are not cunning. You are only clever.

99
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,079
Any cunning man can outwit you just like this.

100
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:01,269
It’s very easy to befool you.

101
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:05,478
Then you should also think why is it that Indians do not even take his name in the morning?

102
00:05:06,678 --> 00:05:09,629
Indian Government is anxious to oust him.

103
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:13,404
Why don’t you think like that?

104
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,774
If India is a place of wisdom,

105
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:19,324
then why he is not at all respected in this country?

106
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:27,448
In fact in all houses if name is also mentioned he’s considered most inauspicious

107
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,677
Inauspicious. In his house, you see, if anybody mentions his name

108
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:34,079
in Indian homes we think it is inauspicious;

109
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,759
we think he’s a Ravana.

110
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:39,108
He’s the incarnation of Ravana, Rajneesh is.

111
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:41,651
Incarnation of?

112
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:42,769
The Ravana.

113
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:43,432
There is a…

114
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:46,331
The one who fought against Rama.

115
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:49,718
Demon, he is a demon no doubt. He is what?  Is he not?

116
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:54,348
He is, hundred per cent he is Ravana. Be sure of it.

117
00:05:58,497 --> 00:06:04,399
(Shri Mataji talks to a child.)

118
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,230
She’s a born realised child.

119
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,933
He is very nicely playing with your mind.

120
00:06:24,406 --> 00:06:27,333
In London, just imagine, in London,

121
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:30,130
nine people got hold of a basement

122
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:34,341
and took out their clothes and danced ecstatically,

123
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:38,360
just take out all your clothes and say, “No, no, no, no, no, no”.

124
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:41,004
And they have within five months time, I don’t know,

125
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:44,545
they have thousands of people. They are buying the whole of London.

126
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,314
Why can’t you see this stupidity?

127
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:58,331
I mean, at least at the time of Hitler you could say that people had this feeling to kill others.

128
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:01,785
But in this, to be stupid is the feeling, is it?

129
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:05,016
Absolute stupidity, nonsense!

130
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:12,959
If by becoming naked you can reach God,

131
00:07:12,985 --> 00:07:15,988
then in the bathroom every day you are like that.

132
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:19,738
I told you that don’t go in the sun too much. Be careful.

133
00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:24,293
You see, this is also very wrong the way you expose your body to sun.

134
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,110
You will develop skin cancers.

135
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:28,521
Believe Me, you will develop skin cancers.

136
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,964
You shouldn’t burn your skin so much.

137
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,884
It's not a good thing, you know.

138
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:36,375
For sun also, you cover yourself and take the thing.

139
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:38,555
Otherwise you will develop skin cancers.

140
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:42,416
You should not overdo anything.

141
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:45,033
Extremes should be avoided.

142
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:50,004
That is how you land into difficulties,

143
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:55,132
How many people in Sweden are committing suicide today?

144
00:07:56,223 --> 00:08:00,091
You are rich people. Why are you committing suicide?

145
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:03,660
While you find there Indians so happy, don’t you?

146
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:05,920
They haven’t got riches or anything.

147
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,521
How are they happy?

148
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,500
Even when they are starving they are happier.

149
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:14,927
Why?

150
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:17,360
I’m not sure whether they are so…

151
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:19,480
Not all, not all, but many.

152
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:28,064
Because India is also [unclear]. They are much influenced by Europeans as well as [unclear].

153
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:32,471
No, no… They could not influence us… They tried, they tried…

154
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:34,451
(Unclear)

155
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:39,467
What is it?

156
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:40,288
Culture

157
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:44,488
(Unclear)

158
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,677
What's he saying?

159
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:52,432
I think he says that also the India’s cultural background has been modified like that, by the West

160
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:54,561
That is true but still we are Indians.

161
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:56,522
(Unclear)

162
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:57,282
Yes, I agree.

163
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:03,649
But you know it can be about of the mind of the Indian people, you know the source and the education of lot of Indians, you know.

164
00:09:03,749 --> 00:09:06,178
That is what you are doing now to give us ideas.

165
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:10,094
You see, you people are coming and give us, giving us ideas.

166
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:13,576
See, we never knew that hashish could be sold like this.

167
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:16,453
Now you are giving us ideas.

168
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:19,506
Apart from that you are trying to develop our country,

169
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:22,297
I agree, I agree,

170
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:25,919
but there’s a great aggression still on.

171
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:28,366
But our this culture cannot be destroyed.

172
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:31,649
Because our culture is a very deep thing,

173
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,389
is very deeply built in our inside, you see.

174
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,629
Our family structures cannot be destroyed easily.

175
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:44,850
These are just permissions on the periphery, but inside India you cannot enter.

176
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,710
You cannot.

177
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,759
This is also another aggression, you don’t know, for us even the sex is an aggression from you people.

178
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,639
We never had these ideas.

179
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,190
For us it is difficult to maintain these horrible demons in this country

180
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,307
but for you people who are maintaining them there.

181
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,546
We would like them to be sent to you people

182
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:11,035
so that you leave us alone with our auspiciousness, holiness and spirituality.

183
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:16,952
It’s a very subtle aggression coming to us and you people are saints.

184
00:10:17,023 --> 00:10:20,442
You must understand you were saints in India in previous lives.

185
00:10:22,851 --> 00:10:25,491
You have to understand our difficulty.

186
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:30,964
You can have your sex, you can have your sex shops,

187
00:10:30,994 --> 00:10:33,323
you can have all nonsense, all your lives, doesn’t matter,

188
00:10:33,403 --> 00:10:36,134
but for us you spare us now.

189
00:10:40,354 --> 00:10:44,437
In India we have a very, absolutely different ideas about the saint.

190
00:10:44,456 --> 00:10:47,806
A saint has to lead a very holy life.

191
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:51,691
He has to be a holy person, very kind, affectionate.

192
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:55,100
He doesn’t take any money from you. He’s not a parasite.

193
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,841
He lives with self-respect.

194
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,642
Villagers just laugh, you see.

195
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:05,131
They cannot understand.

196
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:09,331
If you tell them, “Why do you go and sell them hashish?”

197
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:12,076
They said, “Only the children go and do it. We don’t do it.”

198
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:16,067
I said, “The children will have the sin. Why do you go and tell them?”

199
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:20,582
They said, “No, the children can go and have bath in the river, they're innocent they don’t know.

200
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:25,073
But they are committing sins by doing these things.

201
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:33,956
You must understand it is a very serious matter, My children.

202
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:38,263
It’s a very serious matter and responsibility will be your own.

203
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:44,025
You are saints and how are you going about it?

204
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:49,655
Where is it, in which Scripture it is written

205
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:54,807
that sex should be the criteria for a saint?

206
00:11:56,307 --> 00:11:59,142
All right, I don’t say suppress it like that.

207
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:01,611
Your churches have done nonsensical thing.

208
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:04,491
Of course, that’s all nonsense, I agree. …

209
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:06,782
But this is another extreme,

210
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,561
one is the suppression of sex, all right?

211
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:15,542
Like nunneries and all that. That’s all nonsense, but the other is even worse.

212
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:21,547
You are going from one extreme to another extreme.

213
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,326
God is in the centre.

214
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:36,477
This over excitement and these wrong ideas,

215
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:39,484
I don’t know how I... you should accept.

216
00:12:42,903 --> 00:12:45,504
It is high time you people now understand

217
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:48,149
because it will be very late, later on.

218
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,975
As you said, “Why” to Me? now I am giving you an example.

219
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:58,562
It’s a, it’s a… sort of a hypnosis, a kind of a hypnosis.

220
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:01,331
You are just hypnotised.

221
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:04,131
He does not explain how he does it.

222
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:07,384
He does not as I do. They know how to do it themselves.

223
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:11,783
They know all the methods, how it is done,

224
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,344
how Kundalini is brought up,

225
00:13:13,403 --> 00:13:19,452
how your heart has got the Spirit, which is brought into your parasympathetic.

226
00:13:19,472 --> 00:13:24,211
It’s all written down in our books, how to make it out.

227
00:13:24,232 --> 00:13:26,911
As yesterday, that music you heard?

228
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:32,671
Of Chitananda Lahari, you see you get these vibrations you must get  in the hands.

229
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:40,023
This is what is written in our Scriptures, is there, and this is how one has to achieve.

230
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:46,730
And even a person like Shankaracharya has said

231
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,172
that, “Na yoghe na sankhen”, means “neither by yoga”,

232
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:55,525
means the way you do Hatha yoga “neither by sankhen it works out”

233
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:57,870
but it works out through the grace of Mother.

234
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,842
A person like Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya, such a learned man,

235
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,186
who wrote Vivekachudamani, later on he just wrote the praise of Mother, that’s all.

236
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,456
He said, “Nothing more is needed.”

237
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:14,716
Now Rajneesh is just the opposite of it.

238
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:18,076
He’s teaching you how to insult your Mother.

239
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:28,947
Nothing was wrong with Freud as you can say,

240
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:32,054
because you cannot understand what was wrong with him.

241
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:36,054
You do not have the complete idea as to what you are.

242
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:40,274
I will tell you just now what you are and what you have to achieve.

243
00:14:40,284 --> 00:14:42,095
I’m waiting for all of them to come.

244
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:45,581
You just think over; it’s a very big responsibility.

245
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:50,731
You people have given up materialism, you have started seeking God.

246
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:52,851
Why?

247
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:55,654
Because you were saints in your last life.

248
00:14:55,638 --> 00:15:01,764
It is described that saints would be seeking much more in the Kali Yuga, at this time.

249
00:15:01,764 --> 00:15:08,576
When these demands started all these thugs have also started supplying.

250
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:18,683
What is the transformation of the person who talks to you intermittently?

251
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:22,028
What did he get within himself, an experience.

252
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:24,178
What given experience?

253
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:28,167
You see if he says," Is an experience." You should say, “Can you make out what’s wrong with me?”

254
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,708
Ask him.

255
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:31,527
These people can make out.

256
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:33,976
He told me this chakra is catching,

257
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,940
you will also say.

258
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:39,480
Isn’t it? I mean, there should be some knowledge of yourself.

259
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:41,581
You must get some knowledge within yourself.

260
00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:46,402
Your consciousness must have a wider dimension, do you understand?

261
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:49,234
Now he told me that your left Vishuddhi is catching.

262
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:52,004
So I asked you left Swadishthan to be, to be settled.

263
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:54,620
It pains you there also.

264
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:58,640
Now he doesn’t know where it pains you. How did he tell Me?

265
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,860
See now.

266
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,961
So he could feel that this chakra is catching.

267
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:04,998
Catched.

268
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:06,421
Catched, caught up.

269
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,500
Now I asked, “Do you feel guilty?”

270
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,190
That’s it.

271
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,453
It has been other things also.

272
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,562
All of them can tell you. All of them can tell you what’s wrong with you.

273
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:25,145
Even if you have ten realised children here, if you tie up their eyes

274
00:16:25,296 --> 00:16:29,537
they will tell the same thing, that this is catching in this person and you will also feel the same.

275
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:33,567
You put your hands and you will feel this finger burning.

276
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:38,876
See?

277
00:16:44,697 --> 00:16:48,616
When your sensitivity will improve you will also tell about others.

278
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:55,961
It is your instrument must start working.

279
00:16:55,951 --> 00:16:58,138
What are the experiences you are talking about?

280
00:16:58,128 --> 00:17:02,878
Like a hashish experience, then like a hallucination experience,

281
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:06,667
then other experience; you had many like that, you see.

282
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:12,978
“I was very high. Somebody says I’m very high.” But what did you get?

283
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:18,357
You see, you are, you are just regarding to something by some sort of a chemical thing or a hypnosis.

284
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:22,518
Still all of us have not come.

285
00:17:23,728 --> 00:17:25,557
You have taken the photographs?

286
00:17:25,657 --> 00:17:29,294
Very nice then, I must say. I have professional photographs also.

287
00:17:29,374 --> 00:17:32,794
I think you are very good. Did a good job and we were all surprised.

288
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:37,513
If you want you can take just now but they all have not yet arrived

289
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:51,598
No, but let Mr. George come and see Me. Tell him. Because he still gets sick, you see.

290
00:17:51,782 --> 00:17:55,722
I must get him cured. You tell him today because tomorrow I won’t have any chance.

291
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:56,707
All right?

292
00:17:58,366 --> 00:17:59,916
If you want you can.

293
00:17:59,924 --> 00:18:02,936
Come along, come forward.

294
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:08,196
This sit space is free if you want to get…

295
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:16,738
Now you are better. Much better now, see.

296
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:24,655
See, you are in a way more sort of connected with Sanskrit language, you see.

297
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:28,796
You are the vehicle now for Sanskrit language.

298
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:34,232
But I was surprised that how Germans were influenced by these horrible tantrikas.

299
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,949
They, they don’t know superficial things.

300
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:43,135
You know, to know about tantrikas is like entering into the house through the sewage.

301
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:51,380
First enter into the sewage only and then they got, I mean they never got any knowledge.

302
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,749
No German has written about Shankaracharya. Most surprising.

303
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:57,628
Not a word.

304
00:18:58,598 --> 00:19:04,178
They have written books after books over tantrikas, which is sewage for us, absolutely sewage.

305
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:11,347
They could never enter because perhaps some way or other they were guided into it or taken into it.

306
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:14,087
Mislaid completely.

307
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:20,771
Even Jung I was surprised, even Jung, you see.

308
00:19:20,832 --> 00:19:28,556
Poor thing, you know, they, they come to whatever they read and whatever it is, they could never reach the reality.

309
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:30,846
We have to reach to the bone of this country.

310
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:35,016
Then only you’ll get that peace and bliss which is promised.

311
00:19:35,036 --> 00:19:38,334
You must understand them not from outside but from inside.

312
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:41,564
For that you have to go inside.

313
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:48,672
But these all superficial experiences, if you depend on, then what’s the use?

314
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:08,935
What’s your name? You’ve done really that photograph?

315
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:11,516
Eldon?

316
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,455
Really?

317
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:15,816
You see here you’re walking or what?

318
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:24,295
That’s all right. She has got light also.

319
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,355
Whatever comes in, in a general way…

320
00:20:34,829 --> 00:20:37,192
This is a very subtle happening;

321
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:39,261
it’s a very, very subtle happening.

322
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:47,238
It is not a gross happening where you think of women and think of these dirty things that you’ve before liked having casinos and busy life.

323
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,240
It is not like this. It’s a deep happening.

324
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:58,671
It’s a very, very deep happening and a very subtle happening for you will have to be very, very religious people.

325
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:04,949
While you have no idea of religion in that country, I can tell you.

326
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:08,288
Religion is within, not without.

327
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,659
Like there are some priests and they are coming …

328
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:12,196
"We don’t believe in our priests

329
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:16,317
just for play sake we do, but we don’t think that they are saints."

330
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,257
Saints are very different.

331
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:28,598
So the value of saints is so much reduced because your Pope has started certifying somebody as a saint.

332
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,939
Naturally the Pope himself is not a saint.

333
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:33,721
How does he know somebody is a saint or not?

334
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:42,560
So I don’t blame you, naturally. You are quite a sort of disillusioned,

335
00:21:42,721 --> 00:21:44,303
absolutely correct.

336
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:48,549
but, by just one disillusionment you don't go to another illusion also.

337
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:55,884
What is the reality?

338
00:21:57,721 --> 00:22:05,137
By knowing yourself you should know your inner being and you should know the inner beings of others, isn’t it, Peter?

339
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:08,785
Supposing you are an engineer, take it like that, all right?

340
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,375
If you are an engineer, if you have become an engineer

341
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:17,723
you will know about the instruments that are in your house and in anybody else’s houses.

342
00:22:22,344 --> 00:22:24,903
Sit down, sit down.

343
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:32,019
This is what should happen, by knowing self-knowledge means knowing yourself.

344
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:34,378
What are you thinking about these experiences?

345
00:22:34,378 --> 00:22:39,814
You see, anybody can give you by putting you out somewhere.

346
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:54,574
The experience of the Spirit is that by which you get the knowledge of your being and the knowledge of another person.

347
00:22:59,384 --> 00:23:03,869
Then something that you cannot achieve yourself,

348
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:07,201
It has to come as grace to you. It has to come as grace.

349
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:12,191
If you can achieve God then He is no more God.

350
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,686
If He is the Almighty then you cannot capture Him.

351
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:24,452
He has to come to you, He has to give you, He has to do the job.

352
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:35,003
This is like a kick you get, you see?

353
00:23:35,074 --> 00:23:40,338
What you call a kick, that kind of a kick which brings you down.

354
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:44,540
It gives you a kick. The way it is given a kick, you come down the same way.

355
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,381
Nowhere in the scriptures described it.

356
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:54,846
Either you wipe out all the history of human beings

357
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:57,487
and put these horrible people on the list,

358
00:23:57,596 --> 00:24:04,846
or this, their behaviour, their theories,

359
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:08,465
must tally with the theories of the previous people.

360
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:12,175
They must relate to that.

361
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:16,516
So as I say, this is not a superficial thing, just a kick.

362
00:24:16,596 --> 00:24:21,089
It’s a deep, embedded thing, which works out, flowers out.

363
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:24,079
It’s a reality,

364
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:25,619
and reality takes time.

365
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:33,365
Thousands of people going to Rajneesh itself suggest that it is plastic.

366
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:43,568
There are gurus and gurus one better than other.

367
00:24:43,574 --> 00:24:46,213
Can I [UNCLEAR] Dalai Lama?

368
00:24:47,425 --> 00:24:50,705
What Dalai Lama has done, also? Think about it.

369
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:54,115
See, what you should do is to use your brains.

370
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:57,605
Because somebody is a Dalai Lama must you accept?

371
00:24:57,644 --> 00:25:01,744
All right, what Dalai Lama has done, think it over.

372
00:25:02,565 --> 00:25:05,509
Has he given Realization to anyone?

373
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:08,069
Has he transformed anybody’s life,

374
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,789
by which his life has become a king of happiness, joy?

375
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:22,188
Has he given any peace to anyone? Think it over.

376
00:25:22,268 --> 00:25:25,627
You see, somebody says, “Now this is the place where you will get peace.”

377
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:29,048
You at least see the people who are coming out of it.

378
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:36,798
Dalai Lama, I never knew was such a crook, to be very frank,

379
00:25:36,877 --> 00:25:43,357
till I sat just next to him because my husband was with the Prime Minister in Tibet.

380
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:47,478
The Prime Minister sat, so I could not come out, Lal Bahadur Shastri. So I sat next to him.

381
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:49,759
I was just burning, all burning.

382
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:56,929
So the Prime Minister said, “What’s the matter?” I said, “Oh, God”, I said, “Ma” in Hindi language, I said “You put Me on the other side”.

383
00:25:58,868 --> 00:26:03,221
He was a parasite, these Tibetians were such poor people.

384
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,536
Sit down, sit down, good.

385
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:10,707
He was just a parasite… Hello, how are you? Better? Now, that’s it.

386
00:26:10,717 --> 00:26:13,967
Come along, sit down. If you want you can take another…Yes, good.

387
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:30,327
He was like a parasite, and they were so poor, Tibetans were so poor, where as this man had nothing but some spirits, because of supraconscious.

388
00:26:31,249 --> 00:26:33,835
You will see that in Sahaja Yoga.

389
00:26:34,525 --> 00:26:38,035
See, we have people in this country who have called these spirits,

390
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:42,775
what you call these, as we call it a Smashan Vidya.

391
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:44,836
What do you say to Smashan in English?

392
00:26:46,276 --> 00:26:49,675
Crematorium, the knowledge of the crematorium you see.

393
00:26:49,736 --> 00:26:54,242
So they master some of the spirits, and they use these spirits for this purpose.

394
00:26:54,282 --> 00:26:57,353
They will tell you what horse you are going to win.

395
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:59,403
Even that they can tell you.

396
00:26:59,462 --> 00:27:03,577
Now we must understand what is the interest of God in these things.

397
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:08,938
Why should God tell you who is going to win the horse,

398
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,417
what’s wrong with your father, who is going to become Dalai Lama, this, that?

399
00:27:12,468 --> 00:27:14,520
God has no interest in all that.

400
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:18,832
He has only one interest, only one interest,

401
00:27:18,922 --> 00:27:24,901
that you become your self, that you get connected with the mains

402
00:27:24,921 --> 00:27:28,416
and start understanding Him

403
00:27:28,431 --> 00:27:33,385
and that the instrument that you are should have your fulfilment.

404
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:35,786
That’s the only interest He has.

405
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:43,558
He doesn’t believe in giving you gifts and these experiences so-called of such sort of a hashish and things, no.

406
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:49,558
He wants to give you the complete understanding of yourself through your awareness.

407
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:53,949
It’s an actualisation. It is not just lecturing that I lecture you.

408
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,130
Actually I was not going to give you a lecture because you said, “You must give us a lecture,” so I am giving you.

409
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,071
You ask them. I’ve been working on their back for hours together now.

410
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:06,538
He will tell you, from Denmark.

411
00:28:07,848 --> 00:28:09,547
I have to work hard.

412
00:28:12,498 --> 00:28:17,567
While this Rajneesh works no hard and he has made forty crores of rupees.

413
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:21,438
Just he is telling you that you go into sex like this.

414
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:27,086
I still cannot understand how can you ask for a guru for this.

415
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:31,974
Even a dog and a bitch knows.

416
00:28:35,484 --> 00:28:40,237
Don’t debase yourselves. You are the Spirit. You are not sex points.

417
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:49,690
He will lead you to impotency, complete impotency.

418
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,970
He’ll destroy you completely.

419
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:56,279
He’s just trying to pamper your ego.

420
00:28:56,309 --> 00:29:02,058
He’s just trying to say, “Oh, you are great, you are…” Then “You’ll go there... oh you are very great.”

421
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:05,959
If you are a rich man then you are even greater.

422
00:29:08,878 --> 00:29:11,615
He knows all about your status and everything.

423
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:17,884
He has all the interest in the rich people.

424
00:29:17,944 --> 00:29:25,028
In India also he’s using the Indian women who are rich women and supplying them with men.

425
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:32,536
We had a boy known as Mario, who came to me and told me that he was used by a lady of sixty-five years old for six months

426
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,648
and this lady was giving money to him. I know her name also. Her name is Sharmishta

427
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,092
I get disciples from him who are disillusioned.

428
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:49,473
But I would blame your brains only that you cannot understand these things.

429
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:51,138
How can he?

430
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:55,967
You understand machines, but you don’t understand human beings.

431
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:07,942
He plays on your ego,

432
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:11,063
he pampers your ego

433
00:30:12,363 --> 00:30:14,833
and you like it.

434
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:24,358
You have forgotten Christ completely. What was Christ like?

435
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:26,989
He was a good man.

436
00:30:27,048 --> 00:30:28,161
He was a very good man

437
00:30:28,221 --> 00:30:37,624
He was very, very…. full of knowledge more than other people at His time.

438
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,854
Not only.

439
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:41,773
If He lives now He would, He would…

440
00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:42,863
You would deny Him.

441
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,315
unclear

442
00:30:45,335 --> 00:30:47,204
No, they would not.

443
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:50,753
You would deny Him much more than you would deny anybody else, because

444
00:30:50,753 --> 00:30:55,936
you see, He would not fit in to your conception of heavenly and Godly people.

445
00:30:55,942 --> 00:31:00,449
But only through Sahaja Yoga you will know that Christ exists within you here.

446
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:04,380
You will know that He is there.

447
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:10,111
You see when the Kundalini stops here you have to say Lord’s Prayer and you have to take the name of Christ.

448
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:14,220
Indians do it just like that because they know who He is,

449
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:19,000
they know more than you people.

450
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:25,862
I was thinking that still in everybody of us there’s a Father God working. So we can...

451
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:29,511
You can become that, all right. That’s it, that’s it, I’m

452
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:39,236
I came just to see You. I’ve seen You one year ago, I don’t know. You must remember, I’ve seen You in Delhi, Gandhi Bavan. You were there, about a year ago.

453
00:31:39,317 --> 00:31:39,863
Is it?

454
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:44,026
Yes…. You gave Spontaneous Realization

455
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:50,593
So now, that’s what I am saying that there is a part in you now I will tell you today, once for good, all right? Now.

456
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:57,593
Now this is the human being and [unclear]… All right?

457
00:31:57,663 --> 00:31:59,663
Now please pay attention fully.

458
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,286
Just see here.

459
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:10,973
Here now this is the human being

460
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:16,094
or you have read that God has made man in His own image.

461
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:21,578
So God also, you can say, this is a microcosm

462
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,499
or the base.

463
00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:31,799
Great God and you all are the cells in Him. Made in the same image as this one is.

464
00:32:33,904 --> 00:32:35,650
Now how are you made?

465
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:42,403
You are made from amoeba to a human being. All right?

466
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:46,625
First you were even carbon, even matter.

467
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:51,336
You were evolved from amoeba to this stage.

468
00:32:55,185 --> 00:32:57,345
Why were you evolved?

469
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:01,194
How were you evolved, that you know. But why?

470
00:33:04,924 --> 00:33:09,525
These are different places of your evolution.

471
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:14,041
Like when you are making a machine

472
00:33:14,055 --> 00:33:19,702
first you create a part of it, the base and then the upper part and the upper part, like that.

473
00:33:19,752 --> 00:33:25,690
The whole being that you are is created like this

474
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:31,968
and these are the three main undercurrents, which have made you as a human being.

475
00:33:36,228 --> 00:33:42,068
This, this one, the first one , gives you the existence, the first one.

476
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,550
This channel is called as the Ida Nadi.

477
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:57,681
This channel gives you existence and passes over your heart where resides your Spirit.

478
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,788
The Spirit has nothing to do….

479
00:34:05,837 --> 00:34:10,498
Come in, come in, come in.

480
00:34:10,994 --> 00:34:14,403
Sit down.

481
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:24,088
Sit down. You can come this side.

482
00:34:24,108 --> 00:34:28,646
The men can sit that side. You can come this side, and the ladies can…

483
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:38,173
Ah, you can sit there. They will come to this side. All the men should move this side. The ladies can sit there. It’s all right.

484
00:34:47,664 --> 00:34:54,838
So Indians know this better, that because it has the Virata, you see,

485
00:34:54,856 --> 00:35:02,880
God Almighty you can say, the Virata, in which we are small cells in His being.

486
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,530
We are made the same way as the Virata is made,

487
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,233
the Great Primordial Being, is Virata.

488
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:19,032
In that blue line that you see is the undercurrent for our existence

489
00:35:19,152 --> 00:35:22,373
and called as Ida channel within us.

490
00:35:22,382 --> 00:35:26,469
Now these are subtle channels within us.

491
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:34,507
It is for our existence and also it gives us the activity of our emotional life, left side.

492
00:35:35,617 --> 00:35:39,431
Also it gives you your subconscious area.

493
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:47,103
Where whatever you are listening to Me now, goes into that, in your past.

494
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:54,617
This is a recording of all your past and all the subtle recording of your past goes into this.

495
00:35:58,668 --> 00:36:03,106
On the right side there is another channel here,

496
00:36:03,126 --> 00:36:05,666
which is golden colour.

497
00:36:06,556 --> 00:36:13,335
This one is called as the Pingala Nadi or the Sun line.

498
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:19,697
This is the Moon line and this is the Sun line within us called as Pingala Nadi,

499
00:36:19,726 --> 00:36:28,201
which gives us the physical being of our physical being and also our mental being.

500
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:32,762
So we have left and right, two channels, Ida and Pingala.

501
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:37,364
One is the moon line, another is the sun line.

502
00:36:37,371 --> 00:36:45,097
Now, this one outside is expressed, these two are expressed outside, this is the subtle current inside.

503
00:36:45,157 --> 00:36:51,518
In the medical terminology you can call them left and right sympathetic nervous systems.

504
00:36:53,637 --> 00:36:57,264
In the centre is our evolutionary path

505
00:36:58,364 --> 00:37:06,541
by which arising from the amoeba stage, from here, we have gone up gradually like that.

506
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:12,664
From here we came first of all, from the carbon state to the amoeba state.

507
00:37:12,724 --> 00:37:24,034
Then we rose and there have been altogether nine incarnations so far of the Divine power of evolution.

508
00:37:24,144 --> 00:37:32,045
So here the aspects of evolutionary Divine Power work

509
00:37:32,074 --> 00:37:39,846
while this side the aspect of the existence and desire, aspect of God work

510
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:47,277
and this side this is physical being and the mental being or the creative being works on that.

511
00:37:49,552 --> 00:37:53,891
So God has mainly three aspects:

512
00:37:53,902 --> 00:37:56,668
one is the existence;

513
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:58,822
second is the creation;

514
00:37:58,942 --> 00:38:01,481
and the third is the evolutionary aspect.

515
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:12,628
This one represents the Shiva Tattwa, is the principle of Shiva or Sadashiva.

516
00:38:12,677 --> 00:38:17,601
This is the first and the last, it starts with this,

517
00:38:17,661 --> 00:38:20,686
manifests all this, again dissolves back.

518
00:38:20,786 --> 00:38:23,177
That’s why it is called as Sadashiva.

519
00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:30,996
Then the second principle of creation is represented by Brahmadeva

520
00:38:30,981 --> 00:38:34,713
and His power is called as Saraswati.

521
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:38,364
The third one in the centre, which is evolutionary,

522
00:38:38,387 --> 00:38:44,737
is manifested through the incarnation of Vishnu,

523
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:47,108
of Shri Vishnu.

524
00:38:47,115 --> 00:38:50,596
Shri Vishnu is here

525
00:38:50,686 --> 00:38:55,235
and when He grows to his full maturity He becomes this Virata.

526
00:38:58,856 --> 00:39:03,378
You go on developing from here up to this point.

527
00:39:03,393 --> 00:39:08,088
When you reach that point then only your Sahasrara,

528
00:39:08,106 --> 00:39:09,565
this

529
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:17,177
petaled, as a thousand lotus petals, opens;

530
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:22,239
it has got thousand petals. But you have to grow into a human being.

531
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:29,280
Now this is the point, lowest, is the centre,

532
00:39:29,278 --> 00:39:34,628
is the centre of innocence, occupied by Shri Ganesha,

533
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:40,563
it has nothing to do with the evolutionary piercing.

534
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:48,240
You see, this, this force that is here, the force residual energy that is here, the Kundalini, passes above it.

535
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:53,648
Only this controls the protocol of this force,

536
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:58,958
which is inside; this is the triangular bone called as the coccyx.

537
00:39:59,038 --> 00:40:01,188
You have got the triangular bone.

538
00:40:01,248 --> 00:40:05,760
This energy is placed in this; you can say like the coil it is kept there.

539
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:12,188
This is the main. So this coil has to come out to go to the mains.

540
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:16,617
Now this is a living process.

541
00:40:16,677 --> 00:40:21,677
It is an evolutionary, divine process.

542
00:40:21,737 --> 00:40:24,838
You cannot pay for it, first thing.

543
00:40:24,898 --> 00:40:27,568
It’s like the plumule

544
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:32,978
or you can call it, it is like the

545
00:40:33,168 --> 00:40:39,231
germinating force of a seed which sprouts by itself.

546
00:40:39,282 --> 00:40:42,862
You cannot force it.

547
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,172
You cannot.

548
00:40:46,568 --> 00:40:49,621
You cannot do it.

549
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:55,340
It just works spontaneously through the grace of a Realized soul.

550
00:40:58,851 --> 00:41:02,748
You cannot do anything about it except for one thing

551
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,427
that is this portion,

552
00:41:05,568 --> 00:41:09,637
which you see here it gets stuck.

553
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:17,150
This is the place where a human sustenance is regulated.

554
00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:23,574
This is the part of sustenance, of evolution.

555
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:29,568
Now this portion of the stomach

556
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:32,668
is being sustained

557
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:44,190
and is guarded and guided by the forces of religion.

558
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:51,458
Not the religion you know of outside, like some Brahmins coming and doing Puja, or say some Pope giving you a lecture, not by that,

559
00:41:52,907 --> 00:41:59,485
but by maintaining it through your balancing system within yourselves,

560
00:41:59,505 --> 00:42:04,034
leading a life which is balanced and not extreme.

561
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:09,135
Any extremes will take you out this side to the left,

562
00:42:09,188 --> 00:42:13,909
to the subconscious, the collective subconscious or this side to the supraconscious.

563
00:42:13,938 --> 00:42:17,028
So any extreme is against Me.

564
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:23,206
All the Ten Commandments described in the Bible

565
00:42:23,226 --> 00:42:27,956
are the ten religions we have to follow.

566
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:37,018
This one is a very important thing for Western people to understand.

567
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,148
Of course in India they know that.

568
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:49,027
I was just telling you that if you ask any Indian that you can reach God through sex, they’ll just pull their ears to hear such a thing.

569
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:54,960
But they have been told like this

570
00:42:55,021 --> 00:42:58,951
and they believe into it. Surprisingly... just imagine.

571
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:07,032
Even I mean, my husband when I told him he said that, “No, no. You see, they may not be believing but they must be just trying.

572
00:43:07,112 --> 00:43:10,003
They cannot. How can they believe such a silly thing?”

573
00:43:12,983 --> 00:43:17,405
He’s an intelligent Indian and we have many here people intelligent …

574
00:43:17,425 --> 00:43:20,885
Can you ever think such a thing will be accepted to us in India?

575
00:43:24,025 --> 00:43:26,411
She’s a lady doctor sitting here.

576
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:33,681
And because this is placed down below here, He’s an embodiment of innocence.

577
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:37,735
And this is your Mother, the Kundalini, sitting there.

578
00:43:37,795 --> 00:43:41,565
She’s your Mother. Everybody has that Mother within them.

579
00:43:43,635 --> 00:43:47,367
And this Mother has to rise and open it out.

580
00:43:49,117 --> 00:43:53,367
This is not possible by forcing it. Nothing.

581
00:43:53,478 --> 00:43:57,818
If you are ready it will work out. Like a candle

582
00:43:57,878 --> 00:44:04,998
if it is ready, if it is not wet, then an enlightened candle can enlighten it without any difficulty.

583
00:44:05,057 --> 00:44:10,329
But if the candle is not all right, then the candle has to be put right.

584
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:14,599
That’s what I’ve been doing for the last three days, you know, is to put your candle right.

585
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:19,768
Once the candle is put right, then only the Kundalini is going to rise

586
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:27,528
and give you that experience of the being by which you get this Chitananda Lahari,

587
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:32,574
these vibrations, which are described in all the Scriptures

588
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:42,869
that when you are realized these vibrations start flowing not just talking. I’ve seen many people just talk, “not good vibrations, bad vibrations”. How do you know?

589
00:44:46,228 --> 00:44:48,844
You are not yet connected to the mains.

590
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:56,753
Like this instrument, when you are connected to the mains the record is established, like a computer.

591
00:44:56,768 --> 00:44:59,014
You are made very carefully.

592
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:02,643
For thousands of years this body has been created as a human being.

593
00:45:05,054 --> 00:45:09,083
And this is the last evolutionary thing that has to happen and get.

594
00:45:10,902 --> 00:45:14,382
For that you don’t have to be very well educated.

595
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:16,132
There is no need for you to know much.

596
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:19,414
On the contrary, simpler people get it just like that.

597
00:45:23,184 --> 00:45:27,364
The more you are complicated the more you’ll get problems.

598
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:33,228
Now cancer is the answer, because without cancer you will not understand. So cancer has come, just to teach you.

599
00:45:35,197 --> 00:45:46,217
This is the parasympathetic nervous system in the centre, which is giving you the energy to both the sides, like this. I will show you. This starts…
