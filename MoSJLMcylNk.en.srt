1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Now raise your Kundalini. All of you raise
your Kundalini and tie it up so that it's

2
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:32,380
up there. Just raise it like that. No. This
way. This way you should do it. This way.

3
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:05,050
It's good. Once more.

4
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:12,309
In the West, you have grown very big outside,

5
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,240
like a tree has grown very big. But it must
find its roots, otherwise the whole tree can

6
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,500
fall off, without nutrition. So you must know
the knowledge of the roots.

7
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,289
Without the knowledge of the roots, the tree

8
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:34,289
has no meaning. So this may be a little new
thing for you to understand, but you must

9
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:39,649
know ... to know the knowledge of the roots
you have to become subtle. If you are not

10
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:44,660
a subtle personality you cannot enter into
your roots and you cannot understand what

11
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:51,660
lies in there. So, first of all, I said yesterday,
you all should get your Realisation, and after

12
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,580
your Realisation you can understand this better
than anything else.

13
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,209
Christ came on this earth, but he was only

14
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:07,830
allowed to preach and talk for three and a
half years of his life time. And in tree and

15
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:14,090
a half years is nothing. In that, whatever
was possible he said positively, he told about

16
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:20,360
the future, all that was to happen. He didn't
talk much about the Holy Ghost. The reason

17
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,960
was His Mother was the Holy Ghost at that
time and He didn't want to talk about Her

18
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,960
because the attention of the people would
be on Her and they would have killed Her.

19
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,920
And then he has got eleven destroying powers.
And he would have used those eleven destroying

20
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,840
powers and everything would have been finished,
the whole drama would have been finished.

21
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,310
So He did not mention much about the Holy
Ghost and did not (expect / express / exaplain?)

22
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,710
But logically we must understand that we talk
of the Father and of the Son but not of the

23
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,810
Mother.
How can you have a father and a son and no

24
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,069
mother? That's an impossibility. So, Holy
Ghost is the Primordial Mother.

25
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:10,480
In the sanskrit language if you go - because
in the Bible you cannot find everything about

26
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,680
Christ, it's very (little/literal) - but you
have to go back about 1400 years back, back

27
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,319
in India people have prophesied about Him,
how He will be coming. And about the Primordial

28
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,440
Mother who was called as Adi Shakti who was
the Holy Ghost.

29
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,020
All description was given and when Her advent
will come what will happen and how to recognize

30
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,600
her.

31
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:39,240
All this is described very well so many
years back, even about Christ, quite a lot

32
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,630
to described and also we are going to read
it out to you, the translation of what is

33
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:51,630
written about Christ and then there is a complete
description about His origin, how He came

34
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,840
on this earth and what was the purpose of
His life.

35
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,840
(Ask that gentlemen to come inside. Can
you ? This gentlemen, come inside. You sit

36
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:02,920
comfortably)

37
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,540
4:02 And what was the purpose of His life
and how He has to establish in this centre

38
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,709
here (pointing to the Agya Chakra), and that
by establishing there he can suck the ego

39
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:20,709
and superego in you and how He takes you away,
or He washes off your karmas and your conditionings.

40
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,530
All that has been described very well in the
Devi Mahatmya book out of which we are just

41
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,150
going to read a little bit to you about the
adoration.

42
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,629
So Bible cannot contain Christ, because Christ
is Chaitanya, He is Omkara, He is the Logos

43
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:43,629
as we call Him. He is the Power, and you cannot
describe Him in one little book, when He was

44
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:49,289
here only for three and a half years and the
people who saw him also were his disciples,

45
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:54,659
they did not know much about Him. Until he
was resurrected they did not believe Him and

46
00:04:54,659 --> 00:05:01,139
even after His death, I mean His resurrection,
Matthew and all these people were quite disturbed

47
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:07,779
and upset because you know they were all persecuted
and they, somehow or the other, wanted to

48
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:10,889
continue the message of Christ in a very secretive
manner.

49
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:17,889
So today the time has come for you to
know about Him, about what He was - in the

50
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,460
Heaven and how He came on this Earth. All
that we don't have time today but we'll be

51
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,710
just telling you about a little passage that
is written about him.

52
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:35,710
So first, He is the one who is innocence,
who is an eternal child, and He appears first

53
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,770
on the first chakra of Muladhara, and there
He's called as Shri Ganesh. Where the carbon

54
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:48,770
atom was made. Carbon. And that is very important
to understand that Ganesha is the symbol of

55
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:56,629
innocence and Mother Earth is the power of
that deity, Ganesha.

56
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:04,270
So it was Ganesha, later on incarnated
on this Earth as Christ, and He will be incarnated

57
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:11,279
again as eleven Rudras, means Ekadashas, or
we can call him as Nishkalanka deity, when

58
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:17,919
He will just sort out things in a sense that
He will just cut the people out who are not

59
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,919
realised, who are no good, and the rest of
them will ascend in the Kingdom of Heaven,

60
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,050
this is what is the last Ascent.

61
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,369
Now, for this ...

62
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:32,919
Please sit down, please. Please be seated,
give him a chair or something. You have to

63
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:38,289
sit down comfortably. You see, it is a thing
that makes... happen something within you,

64
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:43,069
so you have to be very much restful, that's
very important. Give him a chair if he cannot

65
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:49,300
sit on the ground. Give him a chair, but be
comfortable otherwise it won't work out, you

66
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,520
see, it is not something that will go into
your mind, it's something that will go to

67
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,669
your being, so you have to be very receptive.

68
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:57,439
Another thing I'll tell you, yesterday also

69
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:03,839
I saw, and today also, you should not move
your neck by eating something or chewing something

70
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,680
because this Vishuddhi chakra gets upset at
that time. So keep still, unless and until

71
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,509
you are still it cannot work out. So please
keep still.

72
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,240
So this is the nourishment of the roots of

73
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,810
which we are going to work out, which you
will feel it, very nicely within yourself.
