1
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:50,519
Today, we are going to do Puja for Navaratri.

2
00:00:50,519 --> 00:01:02,140
Yesterday you saw a beautiful description
of Navaratri, and how the Mother Goddess has

3
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:15,420
created all kinds of powers within you. It's
not that only She has the powers, but you

4
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:25,870
all have the powers and you can all work it
out. You can all find out whether these powers

5
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:41,450
are there or not. With us the Realization
is very important, but there the Kundalini

6
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:52,770
has given you this Realization. Of course
Kundalini is a part, or we can say reflection,

7
00:01:52,770 --> 00:02:10,530
of Adi Shakti, and also 

8
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:37,060
the Jagadamba is also part of Adi Shakti.
She 

9
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:52,660
is placed in the center of two Hearts, which
is a very important point. Now, all these

10
00:02:52,660 --> 00:03:08,530
powers are placed in that Chakra. So you imagine
how many of these powers must be. And Her

11
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:24,060
powers are expressed through the center Heart
in all the Ganas you have around your body.

12
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:37,020
Now these Ganas are the ones who do give you
the protection, give you the sleep, give you

13
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:46,170
the energy, give you the blessings - all of
them are at work all the time - and these

14
00:03:46,170 --> 00:04:04,349
bodies are extremely dedicated and connected
all the time to the Mother Amba: we can call,

15
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:05,860
Jagadamba.

16
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:13,410
Now She is the Mother of the universe; so
you can imagine it, how busy She has to be

17
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:29,300
to look after the whole universe. When this
center becomes weak, that means Her connection

18
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:43,120
with the Ganas is reduced. Ganas also are
weak, and all the powers that could be exercised,

19
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:57,930
cannot be done because of this weakness. It's
a very subtle center because it is Mother's

20
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:08,919
center; is impossible to understand the love
of Mother. It's absolutely impossible. When

21
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:15,330
the girls get married, and they become mothers,
then they start understanding how much their

22
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:26,120
mother must have done for them to come up.
In the same way when Sahaja Yogis become good

23
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:37,419
Sahaja Yogis, like Ganas, they realize how
much the Ganas had to have patience, had to

24
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:48,699
have love and intelligence, to fight the negativity.
So all the forces of the Jagadamba act towards

25
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:52,210
hitting the negativity of all kinds.

26
00:05:52,210 --> 00:06:02,460
That is Her first and foremost nature - is
to destroy all the negativity that is in this

27
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:16,690
world and is against Sahaj, against you. Her
destruction takes place in so many ways. First

28
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:27,449
of all, we have to know that if you sin against
the Goddess, then all kinds of physical problems

29
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:42,279
start - like psychosomatic diseases, all kinds:
we can say cancer, AIDS, all of them. But

30
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:53,939
some of the diseases have got also the mixed
up with the Ganapati. Now Ganapati is the

31
00:06:53,939 --> 00:07:02,850
Lord of all the Ganas. So, the Mother has
Ganapati, and She controls all these Ganas

32
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:14,330
through her son Ganapati. It is so connected.
So the sin against the Mother when we do - means

33
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:25,939
when we become immoral. Immoral means when
we start indulging into things which are not

34
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:35,279
permitted by dharma. By dharma whatever is
permitted is the legal. Now you people understand

35
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:41,069
Sahaj dharma innately, from within. I didn't
have to tell you. Now you know this is wrong,

36
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:51,060
is wrong, this is right, this is right. So
any such things when you try to do, because

37
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:59,240
She is a Mother, She takes time to punish
you. No doubt. But if you commit a sin against

38
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:06,419
the Father, like boastfulness, talking big,
being cruel, harsh and all that - immediately

39
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:16,169
the punishment comes in. But from Her, She
being the Ocean of compassion, the punishment

40
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:28,699
is more delayed, and a full chance is given
to the person to improve himself and guide

41
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:38,490
himself. But when the punishment starts, then
you get into diseases which are of a very

42
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,080
serious nature.

43
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:53,460
So it comes from one thing, what we call as
fear. When somebody frightens you or aggresses

44
00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:04,000
you, or becomes like a maskit as they say;
somebody who is oppressed by aggressive people

45
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:18,820
or is threatened, intimidated, then a person
starts losing faith in the powers of Mother.

46
00:09:18,820 --> 00:10:00,190
As a result, such a person ... So this center
Heart is 

47
00:10:00,190 --> 00:11:05,100
to be looked after. Out of fear, if somebody
is thrown on to the left side, away from the

48
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:14,400
Mother, because She is the one who gives us
confidence, who gives us courage and bravery.

49
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:25,160
But if you are frightened, or if you are under
fear, also you can be thrown to the left side;

50
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:31,660
and you can get into all kind of diseases
which are very serious, incurable as they

51
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:46,920
call them. Another thing is if you are driven
by your senses into indulgences without any

52
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:59,732
dharma, then also this central path throws
away, you can say, you to the left side, because

53
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:09,670
you are not worthy of being at the lotus Feet
of 

54
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:17,260
the Mother. Now, this center is the one which
when we are afraid, the sternum bone starts

55
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:26,330
moving like a remote control and informs all
the Ganas that the attack is coming. But when

56
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:34,400
you deliberately go to the left side, and
get into indulgences, then they are not bothered.

57
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:41,770
They said: "All right, go ahead, do what you
like; you can behave the way you want to behave."

58
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:53,300
All these different types of movements towards
the left, takes you away from your Mother.

59
00:12:53,300 --> 00:13:01,980
I'll tell you a story about somebody in America.
He is a very old Sahaja Yogi, Indian. He came

60
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:08,050
out of his shop, where he was working, and
got into his car - there was one man sitting

61
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:14,600
with a dagger. And he hit him with the dagger
on the center Heart. And this fellow started

62
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,480
bleeding. He said, " I don't know what happened
to me, Mother. I got such strength, I caught

63
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,910
hold of him and I started fighting with him,
and I took the dagger from him. He had the

64
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:34,900
handle and the dagger came into my hand. And
the fellow ran away. But still I was not worried

65
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:42,160
about my bleeding. What I did - I called my
colleague who was coming out of the car, I

66
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,640
ran after him and he took me in his car for
half-an-hour searching that fellow." They

67
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,740
didn't go to the police.

68
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,120
And then they went to the police. The police
was surprised - the whole shirt was full of

69
00:13:52,120 --> 00:14:00,400
blood. He said, "Nobody would believe." Even
the police was shocked. "For half an hour

70
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,210
you were searching this fellow. Why didn't
you come to the police?" He said, "It would

71
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:09,831
have taken half-an-hour for you to come, so
we thought, better do it ourselves." See the

72
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:18,029
courage! Then, of course, he was taken to
the hospital, and he was all right. Just they

73
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:26,190
stitched him up. But he is all right. That
is the sign of a person who can never get

74
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:32,260
any one of these horrible diseases, because
there is no fear in his mind, of any kind.

75
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:41,560
And, he is an Indian, he said: "I have never
even slapped my own children. I have never

76
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,840
fought with anyone. I am not a wrestler by
any chance, nothing of the kind. But it happened."

77
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:54,100
He says, " I don't know how, from where I
got this shakti; and how I did it, I just

78
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,190
don't know."

79
00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:00,980
There are many stories like this they can
tell you about Sahaja Yogis, and about so

80
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:14,070
many saints, how they were never afraid of
attacking someone when somebody attacks them,

81
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:20,711
or of protecting themselves from all kinds
of horrible things with their courage. This

82
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:28,110
is something one cannot believe sometimes,
but it is happening, every day, I get letters

83
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:34,930
from people how they have been courageous.
If you believe in the Goddess, then know that

84
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:42,750
She is extremely powerful; She is very intelligent;
and if She has to protect you, She will protect

85
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:50,650
you out and out, in such a way that you will
not know how you have been protected. But

86
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:56,380
this faith has to be developed. Faith has
to be developed by experience also, how you

87
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,850
have been protected always; how you have been
helped always; how you came out of so many

88
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:09,730
crises. But despite that if you get upset,
worried, if some clouds appear in the sky

89
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:16,940
of your life, then if you get upset, that
means you are still weak. So first thing,

90
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,190
if you are really worshipping the Goddess,
then you should have no worry at all of any

91
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:29,110
kind, and you should have no fear at all.
Go ahead, fearlessly. Whatever you are doing,

92
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:35,691
do it fearlessly. But at the same time I have
to tell you the other side, that one should

93
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:44,730
not go about like a zombie, it doesn't mean
that; saying all kinds of nonsensical things

94
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:53,610
of the right side. But if you have to do something,
do it with clear-cut ideas, and also without

95
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,030
any fear.

96
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:04,480
So all Her powers, you start manifesting it.
A man who is fearless has nothing to worry

97
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:14,679
about - his sleep, his well-being, nothing.
He is fearless. Again I say, "fearless" doesn't

98
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:20,860
mean you go on hitting everybody, saying all
kinds of things, no. It means that you are

99
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:26,039
fearless: anybody who attacks you, you can
always protect yourself. I mean, this story

100
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:33,330
I told you, because this was not a protection
which was from within, like Goddess protecting

101
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:41,070
them, but actually protected himself. So the
power had started working through him. You

102
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:48,980
should allow your mind, your body to project
these powers. Otherwise we say here pujas,

103
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:56,970
everything, all right; and the power is there;
but your mind which tells you "No, no, no,

104
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:05,220
this is not so." There's so many stories,
so many miracles people have described about

105
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,289
this.

106
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:14,049
So, first of all, you should not have any
fear about anything. If you have done nothing

107
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:20,730
wrong, if you are on the right path, you will
be always protected. Now remember this - you

108
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:30,380
will be always protected. Remember this and
believe in this, that: "I am always protected."

109
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:36,789
This is something very difficult, because
perhaps our mind gives ideas: "Oh God, what

110
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:43,169
will happen now; what is going to happen?"...
this thing, that thing.

111
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:51,899
So first and foremost thing, as I said, is
to be fearless - to make the Goddess express

112
00:18:51,899 --> 00:19:00,710
Herself. Supposing now, take it like this:
now all Ganas are following you. Now if the

113
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:15,759
leader of an army is a frightened personality,
what will others do? Thus, you become dependent

114
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:26,799
upon yourself. This faith also must be developed.
I have seen people who are sick - so they

115
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,129
must come and see Me, because they do not
depend upon themselves. They can cure themselves.

116
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:37,720
There is no need for them to come and see
Me. There are many cases where people have

117
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:46,029
cured themselves, cured others, just with
prayer. But the faith, when it is not matured,

118
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:52,399
then they think I, I should treat them. I
should touch them, I should do this, I should

119
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:58,539
do that. Now I have stopped it. I used to
do once upon a time. Reason is, now you depend

120
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:04,619
upon yourself. Not only that you can help
yourself, but you are going to help others.

121
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:11,789
But if you do not have faith in yourself,
that you can cure, you can look after yourself,

122
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:18,169
you can protect yourself; so the whole thing
becomes like a ... all the time the Mother

123
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:22,399
has to do the job.

124
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:29,179
Now you, first of all, you have to feed the
little baby; all right? You can get him aid,

125
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:34,419
look after him, do everything. But when he
grows up, then he doesn't want his mother

126
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:41,029
to feed him. In the same way, the Sahaja Yogis
now, how many years I have been working. You

127
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:54,320
have to grow up dignified and you should mature,
so that you can yourself do things properly.

128
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:04,159
This maturity is there because your Mother
has blessed you. All Her powers She has given

129
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:15,649
you - every. But one power, of patience, is
difficult. You have to be patient like your

130
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:22,390
Mother. You might think it's very difficult.
But try to be. Must have patience, first of

131
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,400
all, with yourself. I have known many people
who think they are spiritually nothing and

132
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:37,049
they have not achieved anything. This is absolutely
a sort of a escapicism, that you want to escape

133
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:43,529
your personality. Just see. If you introspect,
you will find out that you have developed

134
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:51,440
into a real spiritual giant now. Nobody can
touch you; you can do everything; you can

135
00:21:51,440 --> 00:22:00,240
look after yourself; you can support others.
Whatever are the powers of all these that

136
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,980
they were singing yesterday, all these powers
are manifesting in you. But still you leave

137
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:17,159
it to chance and, I should say, you leave
it to others, not to yourself.

138
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:27,820
Now this is one point that no one, so far,
has done this kind of a job - is to connect

139
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:38,169
all the disciples to the Divine power. Because
it is the Divine power of love, you must know

140
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:41,860
how to love others. That's very important.
But again, when it comes to love, they will

141
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:48,549
love their child, love their wife; I mean
it is very common in Sahaja Yoga. They are

142
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:56,649
too attached to their children. Before this,
they were known to be absolutely selfish,

143
00:22:56,649 --> 00:23:02,989
had no attachment for children or wife or
anything. But now it is like a glue. Children

144
00:23:02,989 --> 00:23:11,149
are glued to them, wife is glued to them and
the family - very important. This is another

145
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:18,149
temptation from which you have to get out.
I am not saying that you have to give up your

146
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:27,419
family or your child. But, again I say, the
detachment. The detachment is your power.

147
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:32,440
Watch everything with detachment. Now don't
think that, "Oh, I came only a few days back

148
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:39,600
in Sahaja Yoga"...no. Don't think, "Somebody
is higher than me; I am no good" ... no. You

149
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:51,331
just introspect yourself and see for yourself
how many powers you have already got. And

150
00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:58,919
the more you'll know, the more you'll become
humble. It's very surprising. You'll become

151
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:08,360
humble. No fear of any kind. You can have
fear if you have some, say, lot of money with

152
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:15,389
you. If you are very well educated, you might
have fear of jealousies. If you have other

153
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:21,730
wealth like ornaments and things, you will
be afraid of big thieves coming around. If

154
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:29,049
you are a politician, you might be afraid
that somebody might take away your seat when

155
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:37,941
you are away. But, when it comes really to
Sahaja Yoga, it's the other way round. Who

156
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:52,149
can steal your Self-realization? Tell me!
Who can steal your powers? Who can steal your

157
00:24:52,149 --> 00:25:04,789
vibrations? Think of it. And who can steal
your love? Because it is coming from the Spirit,

158
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:13,460
which is eternal, and the flow is all the
time there. Only when you go away from your

159
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:28,399
Spirit, then only you feel all these things,
which one feels in the darkness.

160
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:35,981
Then another power of Mother is that She gives
you a state in which you are a sakshi, you

161
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:43,980
are a witness, watching everything. You have
tremendous patience; tremendous patience.

162
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:52,000
Whatever's happened, all right, let it be.
This will be all right, that will be all right,

163
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:01,830
this and that. So you get rid of a horrible
thing called anger. And this gives you such

164
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:09,860
a peaceful witness state, that you start becoming
younger and younger. I will tell you, some

165
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:16,239
Sahaja Yogis whom I gave Realization, say,
last year, this time I met them - I could

166
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:23,090
not recognize. They have suddenly become ten
years younger. It's very surprising. And I

167
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:30,049
was Myself, had to confess that I really,
I can't recognize that are you the same people,

168
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:34,749
or are you the son of that fellow?

169
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:46,200
So then, what happens to you is that you become
a peaceful personality. Why? Because your

170
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:54,429
Mother is there always. This faith: She is
always there, She is always with us, always

171
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:59,350
protecting us: but now we are grown up, so
She has given us all the powers. All the property

172
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:09,669
She has given us; so what, what is there to
be afraid of? But this faith has to be not

173
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:17,450
just a blind faith, but an enlightened faith.
Now the difference is, in blind faith you

174
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:25,190
have faith but no powers. In enlightened faith,
you have faith and all the powers. When that

175
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:36,340
happens to you, you start growing very much
fast - first in your dharma. And you are not

176
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,090
afraid of your virtues.

177
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:50,720
You tell people, talk about Sahaja Yoga everywhere,
and it works, it clicks. Once you don't have

178
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,460
any fear, the whole picture will be clear
to you, because you become a visionary: what

179
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:05,559
we call in Sanskrit "drishtas". Like see how
C. S. Lewis could see our procession. How

180
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:15,519
could William Blake predict our future? How
could Gyaneshwara, wrote about "Pasayadan",

181
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,960
which is a description of all the Sahaja Yogis?
But all the time he is saying, "Now you get

182
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,630
up and walk, and do this, you are that, now
you've got it." He is trying to assure people

183
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:35,049
all the time. How could Rabindranath Tagore
see our going to Ganapatipule? How could it

184
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:36,049
happen?

185
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:49,489
It happens only when people are in enlightened
faith. In enlightened faith your Mother gives

186
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:58,100
you another very great power, is of discretion;
of discretion. Somebody came to me, "Mother,

187
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:05,100
You see, this gentleman is very good, this,
that; and You know nobody has looked after

188
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,859
him, this that... He is very well educated,
very moneyed person...this, that." I said:

189
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:16,690
"All right, show Me the photograph." I saw
the photograph. I said: "No - yes,better keep

190
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:23,390
him out. Absolutely. Keep him out!"
He was amazed. "How You say keep him out absolutely?"

191
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:29,700
I saw the photograph, and in the photograph
only how could Mother say that? I could feel

192
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:35,979
the vibrations.
Immediately I said: "Is wrong."

193
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:42,550
One gentleman came here and told Me that some
Nigerians have written letter to him, that

194
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:51,119
"You put thirty-five thousand pounds in the
bank", or something like that, "and we'll

195
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:58,519
put our money, quite a lot, in millions, and
then you can have one third of that." He came

196
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:08,369
and told Me this story. I said, "Really? Keep
out of it." So he said, "Why?" " It's a scam."

197
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:15,769
When he went back to America, they found it
was a scam. He said, "Mother, how did you

198
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:24,279
know?" I said: "You can feel the vibrations
- so hot! So it is a scam." You have got vibrations.

199
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:30,250
You can feel your vibrations. Now if you don't
want to use this new awareness, what is the

200
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,059
use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

201
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:38,080
He was very upset when I told him, "Forget
it." He thought: "Why Mother is saying so?"

202
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,690
I said: "Now what do you need money for? You
need money? All right. We have. Don't take

203
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:51,210
these things." When I told him it's a scam,
he got a shock. When he went back, he found

204
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:59,190
out it was a scam. So at the airport only,
he was on My feet prostrated. I said, "What

205
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:06,220
happened?" "Mother, You are the limit. What
You said is there." I said: "But it was the

206
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:14,909
vibrations which told Me that he is a cheat.
So, if he says so, that he is going to give

207
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:23,970
you so much money, is not correct because
his vibrations were so very bad." In this

208
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:34,749
way, you can gradually experience. With the
experience, try to put the experience in your

209
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:45,000
heart and have faith in that experience. What
were you? What have you become now? How many

210
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:55,659
experiences of Sahaja Yoga you had? - of the
Mother's attention on you. Now if you have

211
00:31:55,659 --> 00:32:02,730
that enlightened faith, enlightened faith
in you, you become powerful...You are powerless,

212
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:09,110
because your faith is like this.

213
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:20,899
But if you become really a evolved, matured
realized soul, then all your powers will work.

214
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:47,129
There's a fisherman in India, who is - I mean,
he is a graduate though he is a fisherman.

215
00:32:47,129 --> 00:32:57,029
So one day, he was going on a boat to another
island to do Sahaja Yoga. And when he came

216
00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:05,220
out of his hut, he found huge big clouds,
black ones, hovering and the Vishnumaya playing.

217
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:12,529
Just he stood on the shore and told Vishnumaya,
"Please tell these clouds to behave themselves.

218
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:19,080
I am going for the work of Mother, and dare
not trouble me on the way." Just told it.

219
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,519
The people who were with him, told me that
this Harishchandra was talking like that.

220
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:31,519
They got into the boat. They did the program,
came home. When he went into his boat, the

221
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,289
rain started.

222
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:43,340
So you control all five elements by your enlightened
faith. For which you don't even have to say

223
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:51,250
anything. The powers are so great that they
act. See now: today when the Puja was to be

224
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:58,979
done, suddenly it became pleasant. I didn't
ask. Just it became pleasant, much better

225
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:09,149
than yesterday: could have been very cold.
But this should become again, a faith which

226
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:16,349
is reality. If you remember last time, we
had a horrible rain and the whole thing was

227
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:24,990
jumping up and people had to pull all these
pillars down. As soon as they started saying

228
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:32,691
My "Jai", it stopped. Now, this experience
should make you; there was no need for you

229
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:41,260
to pull the ... these pillars, but you had
to just sing My "Jai", that's all. Instead

230
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,280
of that, you were busy with pulling all of
you that thing. I was just looking at you,

231
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,770
I didn't know what to say anything; I said,
"Let them try."

232
00:34:49,770 --> 00:35:00,710
So these ordeals also come to make you mature.
These ordeals if they are not there, these

233
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:08,030
ordeals if they do not come, then you will
not supersede them; and if you will not supersede

234
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:15,290
them, you will not know what is your faith.
A person who is standing on the shore will

235
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:22,080
say, "I don't know how to swim." But supposing
you made him jump into the water and he swims,

236
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:32,130
then he knows that he can swim. Because you
do not know what you have become. You do not

237
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:38,220
know that you can swim. You do not know that
you can also save others. You are still busy

238
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:45,270
with small, small, little, little things here
and there. But if you just know what you have

239
00:35:45,270 --> 00:36:01,860
become, then you are going to completely change.
Your smallness, which looks like a little

240
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:11,670
particle, will cover the whole sky. But this
power that is within you, will not give you

241
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:19,400
ego. One thing, the test is, it makes you
humble. This is one of the things: that it

242
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,730
makes you humble, and extremely loving and
compassionate. You will not hurt other people

243
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:33,880
with these powers; that's the sign: it is
Mother's love, power of Mother's love. A person

244
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:42,730
who has a mother, very loving and nice, it's
a psychological fact, becomes a very nice

245
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,090
person; it's a psychological fact.

246
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:54,810
So now if you realize what you are now, what
you have become. Navaratri Puja is, that's

247
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:04,230
why, is a very, very powerful Puja in a way:
because it manifests, opens out the channels

248
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:16,580
of your power, that's why it's very, very
important; and since morning I have been just

249
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:24,011
flowing with vibrations, tremendous, it was
like a waterfall of vibrations. And the whole

250
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:27,100
time I am seeing light, light, light, light;
I was thinking, "Now I don't know what am

251
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:33,850
I going to speak or something." That's why
I closed My eyes, because all the time there

252
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,920
will be something else I will be seeing and
not you people; so better, I thought, I'll

253
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:49,560
close My eyes. But now you are the light.
You are the light. Light is not afraid of

254
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:57,330
darkness, is it? Because, it can remove the
darkness. That's what you are, but you don't

255
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:04,250
know what you are, and you live with very
small, very small ideas about yourself.

256
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:14,800
I am not saying that you should become like
gurus that go round talking big, with two

257
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:24,480
horns on their head, no. What is your decoration
is your humility, is your kindness, is your

258
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,560
sweetness, and the way you handle people.
You will be amazed, I also tell people when

259
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:38,240
I find there is something wrong with them.
I also do it, no doubt; but in a way that

260
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:45,190
the person understands it is for the benevolence
of that person. So the whole personality,

261
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:59,680
the whole temperament, everything changes;
the whole face changes; the whole movement

262
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:09,520
changes. The style of talking changes, automatically
as if you know the machinery has changed,

263
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:21,520
within. So you develop the qualities of a
real Mahayogi.

264
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:35,640
This Mahayogi condition is achieved by many
people also before, but they had to go through

265
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:44,230
very circuitous life. They had to give up
everything, not to show, but really from the

266
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:51,390
heart they had to detach. They had to get
out of it, go to some far-fetched places,

267
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:55,900
and live on ordinary food. All kinds of . . .even
Buddha suffered so much. Christ suffered so

268
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:06,840
much. They were Incarnations but still they
had to suffer. Rama suffered so much; Shri

269
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:12,180
Krishna suffered so much: imagine. Now you
people didn't have to suffer. On the contrary

270
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:28,870
you all came out of the suffering: enjoyment,
music, everything. But to enjoy Sahaja Yoga,

271
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:40,280
in Niranand - absolutely without anything
else but joy - then one has to know that he

272
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:47,541
should give up all the myths with which he
is living. All kinds of myths there are. Some

273
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:52,680
people have myths: "We are very poor". Some
have myths: "We are very rich". Some have

274
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,870
this thing that "We are very unhappy". Some
have that "We are very happy". All kinds of

275
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:10,960
myths these are. These are all myths. What
is the thing is the complete emptiness; complete

276
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:19,600
emptiness. That is joy. This emptiness is
filled with joy. Complete emptiness. Then

277
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:27,060
you don't expect anything from anyone. And
this emptiness from within is actually, gives

278
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:34,750
chance to compassion and love to enter into
you. Supposing there is something in a pot

279
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:42,760
already, what can you pour into it? What can
you give into it? So if you are completely

280
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:49,310
empty within, there's nothing of this nonsense
of the past and the future: the aspirations,

281
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:57,490
the ambitions, all those things, and falsehood.
If you just become empty, it is filled in

282
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:05,880
with nothing but joy, and joy of such a eternal
nature. You never asked for it; you do not

283
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:14,330
look forward to it. It is there, all the time.
And this is what I wish today you people can

284
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,330
feel it.

285
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:25,210
As you know, the Devi's things are so very
deep and subtle: how She took the form of

286
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:38,380
a Mother and how She looked after Her bhaktas
with love; how She fought demons and also

287
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:46,510
negativity. But now the demons have entered
into your hearts; these false gurus have entered

288
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:53,480
into your brains. Through these horrible books
so many things are coming, all the time attacking

289
00:42:53,480 --> 00:43:02,670
you. Even if you kill those demons, still
they'll be lingering in your heads. They should

290
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:10,580
be actually killed when they, once they are
reflected into your mind, have gone away.

291
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:16,280
Then only it's possible to eliminate them.
Otherwise, they will go away but leave their

292
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:25,280
bhoots into your heads. So these negativities,
which come from wrong type of following you

293
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,360
have had, from wrong books you have been reading,
also in Sahaja Yoga when you come, you can

294
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:37,851
be misled by some people - it's possible.
In that case also, forgive that person. That

295
00:43:37,851 --> 00:43:43,270
person may improve, but you may continue with
the same ideas and funny things and will suddenly

296
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:48,290
come up.

297
00:43:48,290 --> 00:44:02,870
So the quality is of compassion and love,
fearlessness and courage and the complete

298
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:10,080
emptiness. In this emptiness, then, you are
not worried about what you have to achieve,

299
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:16,610
how many people you have to gather, how many
must come to Sahaja Yoga - not bothered about

300
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:20,361
that. Automatically it will work out, but
you would not desire for it, and you will

301
00:44:20,361 --> 00:44:28,130
not hanker: "Oh my God," say, "There is not
many people, what to do?"... this, that. It

302
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:33,940
is good for us in a way, because where is
the place in heaven for so many stupid people?

303
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:45,860
So we should not run after people who are
negative and useless. But we must definitely

304
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:54,620
take over the people who are genuinely good.
One thing more I would like to tell you, that

305
00:44:54,620 --> 00:45:01,800
automatically such people are dropped out
in Sahaja Yoga. In one shot they will go away.

306
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,510
They don't stay, because they don't deserve
to be there. They don't deserve to have the

307
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:15,070
Mother's powers. So this happens in a very
beautiful, subtle manner. And I see, I go

308
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:24,160
late always to any program, so those who are
useless just disappear. And some of them disappear

309
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,080
half-way through, because nothing goes into
their head, really, they don't understand

310
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:35,860
anything, so they go away. So now the ones
which are left are the real seekers of truth

311
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:42,360
and they get, all of them, Realization. In
Sanskrit they call it "cheyen" - means "selection".

312
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:51,820
This is a natural selection that takes place,
and how people go away and how they come back

313
00:45:51,820 --> 00:46:01,420
to Sahaja Yoga, it's very interesting. This
is a common happening in Sahaja Yoga, you

314
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:06,910
know. You should not get upset. Now if you
get too many people, say from Russia, and

315
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:14,560
not so much from Switzerland, maybe you might
think that way; but now it's not that bad.

316
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:23,950
Then we should not worry, because we are no
more Russians or Swiss. We are superhuman

317
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:30,720
beings, we are Sahaja Yogis. Whether they
are Russians or whether they are Indians or

318
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:38,820
from some African land, it's all right. As
long as they are Sahaja Yogis, we should be

319
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:45,120
happy. If the Swiss are coming to Sahaja Yoga,
we should be happy. So this attachment, in

320
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:50,140
a way, is good to begin with, that you want
to bring more Swiss, because you want to have

321
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:57,710
company. Now you can't live with one person
in a jungle, with all the others non-Sahaja

322
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:02,300
Yogis, you see - difficult. So you want to
have company. So you want to have more and

323
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:08,390
more and more. But doesn't matter. As many
as there are sufficient, and we shouldn't

324
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:12,040
worry about those things, the number.

325
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:19,050
But when we want to share our love, then we
do feel the dearth. Not because we are Swiss,

326
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:27,980
but because we cannot share. That time a new
personality rises, and this new personality

327
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:36,470
is the one which works. I mean we are not
giving you any money; there are no awards

328
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:43,060
for you. There's no way there's much encouragement,
like we have your sort of a picture hanging

329
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:48,730
here, nothing of the kind. Can you imagine
in any organization anybody would work like

330
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:55,550
this, the way you work? Nobody would. They
give you awards, they give you bonuses, also

331
00:47:55,550 --> 00:48:02,860
they give you promotions; they do all kinds
of things, you see, to keep you going. But

332
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:09,520
we don't do anything in Sahaja Yoga. So what
makes you work so hard in Sahaja Yoga, what

333
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:17,290
makes you spread Sahaja Yoga? Only thing is
that you want to share. You can't help it,

334
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:22,420
it's like a drunkard you see. If he has a
bottle, he must have at least one person to

335
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:33,640
share with him, because he thinks that it
would be sinful: "As it is I am doing sin,

336
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:52,141
why not share with somebody else?" So it would
be half-half divided. But in Sahaja Yoga you

337
00:48:52,141 --> 00:49:02,620
share it; you want to spread it. It is because
you are collective; you have become collective,

338
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:10,630
that's why. You want more to come in, more
to join, to enjoy. You become a very noble

339
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:16,250
person, you see? Like, of course drunkards
do that, but supposing somebody has a lottery,

340
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:24,480
or some, he gets a very big business, he won't
like to share. But you think that "Why not?

341
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:34,170
If I am so much enjoying, why not others?
Why not people have the same bliss as I have?"

342
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:42,950
So because you become extremely noble, so
noble, you work so hard, so very hard to achieve

343
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:50,900
it. I mean, no words can describe My joy when
I see you people working it so spontaneously.

344
00:49:50,900 --> 00:50:02,520
Yesterday I saw the film, the whole drama,
and I was really very much amazed and touched

345
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:14,910
that this Marathi music has come to Cabella.
Can you imagine any Italian thinking of it?

346
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:22,660
Even hundred years to come he would not think.
But how it has come so spontaneously and is

347
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:28,990
working out? Because there is a sense of collectivity.

348
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:36,190
The "New Age" people talk of is here, no doubt.
This is the New Age, and new consciousness

349
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:42,950
is also there. But what is the "new" now is
the new collectivity, and that collectivity

350
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:51,970
acts, that you want to spread: it acts, like
your hunger, it is another kind of hunger,

351
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:57,690
that you want to create more Sahaja Yogis,
you want to have more brothers and sisters,

352
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:02,840
and you want to help them so that they could
come to the Pujas and all that and become

353
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:10,500
good Sahaja Yogis. Now this kind of an ambition
or a joy or whatever you may call it, is the

354
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:18,600
whole plan, shows that in your heart, the
collectivity is prospering. And that's why

355
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:25,670
you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga alone, sitting
in the Himalayas -no. You want to have other

356
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:26,700
people.

357
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:34,320
This is now the sign of how the Mother's love
has taken roots in your hearts and how you

358
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:43,100
are all going to spread Sahaja Yoga. Of course
I'm told that somebody in Australia making

359
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:49,230
money - Australia has been always a problem
- they are making money out of this; so I

360
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:55,040
just don't know what to say, because this
is, I can't understand. How can they think

361
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:06,260
of making money or doing all kinds of things,
and doing all kinds of asahaj things? Some

362
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:14,290
sort of a headache comes up, doesn't matter.
Leave it to Me. I'll manage it, whatever it

363
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:21,310
is; but you just become great lights of your
Mother. That's what I have to request you

364
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:31,140
tonight. You have all the power flowing in
you, you have the light which is enlightened,

365
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:38,910
but you must expand. Expand it more and more
and more, and you will be surprised what Tukarama

366
00:52:38,910 --> 00:53:09,350
has said, that, "I am like a small little
particle of dust, and also 

367
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:57,150
I am the whole sky." This is what is your
personality.

368
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:59,460
May God bless you all.
