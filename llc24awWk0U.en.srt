1
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:41,760
Today, we are going to do Puja for Navaratri.

2
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,470
Yesterday you saw a beautiful description

3
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,544
of Navaratri, and how

4
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:08,801
the Mother Goddess has created all kinds of powers within you.

5
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:14,288
It's not that only She has the powers,

6
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:17,378
but you all have the powers

7
00:01:18,183 --> 00:01:20,586
and you can all work it out.

8
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:27,328
You can all find out whether these powers are there or not.

9
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:37,164
With us the Realization is very important,

10
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:44,756
but there the Kundalini has given you this Realization.

11
00:01:47,195 --> 00:01:49,902
Of course Kundalini is a part,

12
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:55,222
or we can say reflection, of Adi Shakti, and also

13
00:02:10,303 --> 00:02:15,469
the Jagadamba is also part of Adi Shakti.

14
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:45,407
She is placed in the center of two Hearts,

15
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:49,795
which is a very important point.

16
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:58,837
Now, all these powers are placed in that Chakra.

17
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:03,939
So you imagine how many of these powers must be.

18
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:12,983
And Her powers are expressed through

19
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:22,019
the center Heart in all the Ganas you have around your body.

20
00:03:24,262 --> 00:03:30,044
Now these Ganas are the ones who do give you the protection,

21
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:38,911
give you the sleep, give you the energy, give you the blessings

22
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:43,397
- all of them are at work all the time -

23
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:54,327
and these bodies are extremely dedicated

24
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:58,784
and connected all the time to the Mother

25
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:02,571
Amba: we can call, Jagadamba.

26
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,646
Now She is the Mother of the universe;

27
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:11,333
so you can imagine it,

28
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,189
how busy She has to be to look after the whole universe.

29
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:22,879
When this center becomes weak,

30
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:31,758
that means Her connection with the Ganas is reduced.

31
00:04:32,443 --> 00:04:35,062
Ganas also are weak,

32
00:04:35,856 --> 00:04:42,953
and all the powers that could be exercised,

33
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:48,172
cannot be done because of this weakness.

34
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:55,145
It's a very subtle center

35
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,743
because it is Mother's center;

36
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:02,371
is impossible to understand the love of Mother.

37
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:06,963
It's absolutely impossible.

38
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:12,158
When the girls get married, and they become mothers,

39
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:14,264
then they start understanding

40
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:18,820
how much their mother must have done for them to come up.

41
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:28,057
In the same way when Sahaja Yogis become good Sahaja Yogis,

42
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:33,484
like Ganas, they realize how much

43
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:38,490
the Ganas had to have patience, had to have love

44
00:05:38,684 --> 00:05:42,493
and intelligence, to fight the negativity.

45
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,343
So all the forces of the Jagadamba act towards

46
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:51,451
hitting the negativity of all kinds.

47
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:56,332
That is Her first and foremost nature

48
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:59,146
- is to destroy all the negativity

49
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:06,947
that is in this world and is against Sahaj, against you.

50
00:06:10,992 --> 00:06:15,022
Her destruction takes place in so many ways.

51
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:22,548
First of all, we have to know that if you sin against the Goddess,

52
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:28,190
then all kinds of physical problems start

53
00:06:28,576 --> 00:06:32,510
- like psychosomatic diseases, all kinds:

54
00:06:35,243 --> 00:06:40,949
we can say cancer, AIDS, all of them.

55
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,147
But some of the diseases

56
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,464
have got also the mixed up with the Ganapati.

57
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:56,004
Now Ganapati is the Lord of all the Ganas.

58
00:06:56,503 --> 00:07:02,359
So, the Mother has Ganapati, and She controls all these Ganas

59
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,671
through her son Ganapati. It is so connected.

60
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,839
So the sin against the Mother when we do

61
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,255
- means when we become immoral.

62
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:22,887
Immoral means when we start indulging into things

63
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:27,625
which are not permitted by dharma.

64
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:32,545
By dharma whatever is permitted is the legal.

65
00:07:33,782 --> 00:07:36,379
Now you people understand Sahaj dharma

66
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,452
innately, from within. I didn't have to tell you.

67
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:43,422
Now you know this is wrong, is wrong, this is right, this is right.

68
00:07:43,857 --> 00:07:49,176
So any such things when you try to do,

69
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:54,551
because She is a Mother, She takes time to punish you.

70
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:59,613
No doubt. But if you commit a sin against the Father,

71
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:04,039
like boastfulness, talking big, being cruel, harsh and all that

72
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:07,983
- immediately the punishment comes in.

73
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:14,687
But from Her, She being the Ocean of compassion,

74
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:18,814
the punishment is more delayed,

75
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:26,572
and a full chance is given to the person to improve himself

76
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,711
and guide himself. But when the punishment starts,

77
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:38,105
then you get into diseases which are of a very serious nature.

78
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:45,647
So it comes from one thing, what we call as
fear.

79
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:53,611
When somebody frightens you or aggresses you,

80
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,541
or becomes like a maskit as they say;

81
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,065
somebody who is oppressed by aggressive people

82
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:11,287
or is threatened, intimidated,

83
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:17,554
then a person starts losing faith in the powers of Mother.

84
00:09:18,502 --> 00:09:23,303
As a result, such a person ...

85
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:54,636
So this center Heart is to be looked after.

86
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,811
Out of fear, if somebody is thrown on to the left side,

87
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,222
away from the Mother,

88
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,804
because She is the one who gives us confidence,

89
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:13,113
who gives us courage and bravery.

90
00:11:13,986 --> 00:11:19,256
But if you are frightened, or if you are under fear,

91
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:23,694
also you can be thrown to the left side;

92
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:28,269
and you can get into all kind of diseases

93
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:32,841
which are very serious, incurable as they call them.

94
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:40,537
Another thing is if you are driven by your senses

95
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:48,473
into indulgences without any dharma,

96
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:57,342
then also this central path throws away, you can say,

97
00:11:57,468 --> 00:12:01,348
you to the left side, because you are not worthy of being

98
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:04,106
at the lotus Feet of the Mother.

99
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:15,584
Now, this center is the one which when we are afraid,

100
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:17,882
the sternum bone starts

101
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:20,745
moving like a remote control and informs

102
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,689
all the Ganas that the attack is coming.

103
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:29,979
But when you deliberately go to the left side,

104
00:12:30,237 --> 00:12:34,126
and get into indulgences, then they are not bothered.

105
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:38,029
They said: "All right, go ahead, do what you like;

106
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,150
you can behave the way you want to behave."

107
00:12:41,365 --> 00:12:48,646
All these different types of movements towards the left,

108
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:52,178
takes you away from your Mother.

109
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:58,007
I'll tell you a story about somebody in America.

110
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,230
He is a very old Sahaja Yogi, Indian.

111
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:05,292
He came out of his shop, where he was working,

112
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,372
and got into his car - there was one man sitting with a dagger.

113
00:13:09,553 --> 00:13:12,942
And he hit him with the dagger on the center Heart.

114
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:15,124
And this fellow started bleeding.

115
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:17,941
He said, " I don't know what happened to me, Mother.

116
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:19,678
I got such strength,

117
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:22,545
I caught hold of him and I started fighting with him,

118
00:13:22,705 --> 00:13:25,188
and I took the dagger from him.

119
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:29,182
He had the handle and the dagger came into my hand.

120
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:31,503
And the fellow ran away.

121
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,126
But still I was not worried about my bleeding.

122
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,150
What I did

123
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:41,442
- I called my colleague who was coming out of the car,

124
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:43,255
I ran after him

125
00:13:43,394 --> 00:13:46,599
and he took me in his car for half-an-hour searching that fellow."

126
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,963
They didn't go to the police.

127
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:52,152
And then they went to the police. The police was surprised,

128
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:55,947
the whole shirt was full of blood.

129
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:59,094
He said, "Nobody would believe." Even the police was shocked.

130
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:01,825
"For half an hour you were searching this fellow.

131
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,683
Why didn't you come to the police?"

132
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:06,302
He said, "It would have taken half-an-hour for you to come,

133
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:09,128
so we thought, better do it ourselves."

134
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:10,718
See the courage!

135
00:14:12,414 --> 00:14:15,422
Then, of course, he was taken to the hospital,

136
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:17,274
and he was all right.

137
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:21,036
Just they stitched him up. But he is all right.

138
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,398
That is the sign of a person

139
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:28,913
who can never get any one of these horrible diseases,

140
00:14:29,562 --> 00:14:34,687
because there is no fear in his mind, of any kind.

141
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:38,184
And, he is an Indian,

142
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,543
he said: "I have never even slapped my own children.

143
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:42,750
I have never fought with anyone.

144
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,940
I am not a wrestler by any chance, nothing of the kind.

145
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:47,514
But it happened."

146
00:14:47,702 --> 00:14:50,588
He says, " I don't know how, from where I got this shakti;

147
00:14:50,787 --> 00:14:53,952
and how I did it, I just don't know."

148
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,377
There are many stories like

149
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,098
this they can tell you about Sahaja Yogis,

150
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:05,362
and about so many saints, how they were never afraid of

151
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:13,949
attacking someone when somebody attacks them,

152
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,433
or of protecting themselves

153
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:19,980
from all kinds of horrible things with their courage.

154
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:24,740
This is something one cannot believe sometimes,

155
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,087
but it is happening, every day,

156
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:30,395
I get letters from people how they have been courageous.

157
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:33,452
If you believe in the Goddess,

158
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:37,080
then know that She is extremely powerful;

159
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:39,500
She is very intelligent;

160
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,648
and if She has to protect you, She will protect you

161
00:15:42,814 --> 00:15:46,178
out and out, in such a way that

162
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:49,225
you will not know how you have been protected.

163
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:52,519
But  this faith has to be developed.

164
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,860
Faith has to be developed by experience also,

165
00:15:56,011 --> 00:15:58,204
how you have been protected always;

166
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,293
how you have been helped always;

167
00:16:00,432 --> 00:16:02,499
how you came out of so many crises.

168
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:06,697
But despite that if you get upset, worried,

169
00:16:06,936 --> 00:16:11,150
if some clouds appear in the sky of your life,

170
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,190
then if you get upset, that means you are still weak.

171
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:19,198
So first thing, if you are really worshipping the Goddess,

172
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,816
then you should have no worry at all of any kind,

173
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:27,947
and you should have no fear at all. Go ahead, fearlessly.

174
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:31,080
Whatever you are doing, do it fearlessly.

175
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,899
But at the same time I have to tell you the other side,

176
00:16:35,063 --> 00:16:40,587
that one should not go about like a zombie,

177
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:42,504
it doesn't mean that;

178
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,646
saying all kinds of nonsensical things of the right side.

179
00:16:45,865 --> 00:16:48,178
But if you have to do something,

180
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:50,876
do it with clear-cut ideas,

181
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:54,722
and also without any fear.

182
00:16:56,675 --> 00:16:59,960
So all Her powers, you start manifesting it.

183
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:04,295
A man who is fearless has nothing to worry

184
00:17:04,493 --> 00:17:08,937
about his sleep, his well-being, nothing.

185
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,409
He is fearless.

186
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:15,163
Again I say, "fearless" doesn't mean that

187
00:17:15,343 --> 00:17:18,656
you go on hitting everybody, saying all kinds of things, no.

188
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:21,248
It means that you are fearless:

189
00:17:21,446 --> 00:17:24,462
anybody who attacks you, you can always protect yourself.

190
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:26,727
I mean, this story I told you,

191
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:29,298
because this was not a protection

192
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:31,347
which was from within, like

193
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:33,588
Goddess protecting them,

194
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,827
but actually protected himself.

195
00:17:36,993 --> 00:17:39,958
So the power had started working through him.

196
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:43,881
You should allow your mind, your body

197
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:46,434
to project these powers.

198
00:17:47,158 --> 00:17:50,746
Otherwise we say here pujas, everything, all right;

199
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,524
and the power is there;

200
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:58,257
but your mind which tells you "No, no, no, this is not so."

201
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,531
There's so many stories,

202
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,313
so many miracles people have described about this.

203
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:11,194
So, first of all, you should not have any fear about anything.

204
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:13,678
If you have done nothing wrong,

205
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:18,321
if you are on the right path, you will be always protected.

206
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:22,906
Now remember this: you will be always protected.

207
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,464
Remember this and believe in this,

208
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,981
that: "I am always protected."

209
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:32,092
This is something very difficult,

210
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:35,128
because perhaps our mind gives ideas:

211
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:38,183
"Oh God, what will happen now; what is going to happen?"...

212
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:40,022
this thing, that thing.

213
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:46,115
So first and foremost thing, as I said,

214
00:18:46,295 --> 00:18:52,564
is to be fearless - to make the Goddess express Herself.

215
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,845
Supposing now, take it like this:

216
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:58,267
now all Ganas are following you.

217
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:06,025
Now if the leader of an army is a frightened personality,

218
00:19:06,403 --> 00:19:08,083
what will others do?

219
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:17,757
Thus, you become dependent upon yourself.

220
00:19:19,537 --> 00:19:22,459
This faith also must be developed.

221
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:25,634
I have seen people who are sick

222
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,244
- so they must come and see Me,

223
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,591
because they do not depend upon themselves. They can

224
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,341
cure themselves. There is no need for them to come and see Me.

225
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:39,338
There are many cases where people have cured themselves,

226
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:42,394
cured others, just with prayer.

227
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:47,812
But the faith, when it is not matured,

228
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:50,583
then they think I, I should treat them.

229
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:53,062
I should touch them, I should do this, I should do that.

230
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,888
Now I have stopped it.

231
00:19:55,073 --> 00:19:56,840
I used to do once upon a time.

232
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:59,609
Reason is, now you depend upon yourself.

233
00:19:59,987 --> 00:20:02,043
Not only that you can

234
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,334
help yourself, but you are going to help others.

235
00:20:04,474 --> 00:20:07,203
But if you do not have faith in yourself,

236
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:11,639
that you can cure, you can look after yourself,

237
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:14,616
you can protect yourself; so the whole

238
00:20:14,854 --> 00:20:17,028
thing becomes like a ...

239
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:20,008
all the time the Mother has to do the job.

240
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:25,266
Now you, first of all, you have to feed the little baby;

241
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:26,426
all right?

242
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:30,946
You can get him aid, look after him, do everything.

243
00:20:31,138 --> 00:20:32,672
But when he grows up,

244
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,898
then he doesn't want his mother to feed him.

245
00:20:36,116 --> 00:20:38,397
In the same way, the Sahaja Yogis now,

246
00:20:38,557 --> 00:20:40,481
how many years I have been working.

247
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,770
You have to grow up dignified and you should mature,

248
00:20:47,216 --> 00:20:51,930
so that you can yourself do things properly.

249
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:59,124
This maturity is there because your Mother has blessed you.

250
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:03,653
All Her powers She has given you - every.

251
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:11,086
But one power, of patience, is difficult.

252
00:21:12,852 --> 00:21:15,586
You have to be patient like your Mother.

253
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:20,009
You might think it's very difficult. But try to be.

254
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:23,499
Must have patience, first of all, with yourself.

255
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,704
I have known many people

256
00:21:25,923 --> 00:21:27,775
who think they are spiritually nothing

257
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:29,650
and they have not achieved anything.

258
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:35,166
This is absolutely a sort of a escapicism,

259
00:21:35,721 --> 00:21:38,521
that you want to escape your personality.

260
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:41,586
Just see. If you introspect, you will find out

261
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:46,816
that you have developed into a real spiritual giant now.

262
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,735
Nobody can touch you;

263
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,801
you can do everything; you can look after yourself;

264
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,620
you can support others.

265
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:58,019
Whatever are the powers

266
00:21:58,237 --> 00:22:01,245
of all these that they were singing yesterday,

267
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:05,529
all these powers are manifesting in you.

268
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:10,046
But still you leave it to chance and,

269
00:22:10,225 --> 00:22:13,745
I should say, you leave it to others, not to yourself.

270
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:20,609
Now this is one point

271
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:25,133
that no one, so far, has done this kind of a job

272
00:22:25,372 --> 00:22:30,510
- is to connect all the disciples to the Divine power.

273
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:37,247
Because it is the Divine power of love,

274
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:42,339
you must know how to love others. That's very important.

275
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:45,148
But again, when it comes to love,

276
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:47,539
they will love their child, love their wife;

277
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:49,987
I mean it is very common in Sahaja Yoga.

278
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:53,164
They are too attached to their children. Before this,

279
00:22:53,362 --> 00:22:56,450
they were known to be absolutely selfish,

280
00:22:56,707 --> 00:23:00,418
had no attachment for children or wife or anything.

281
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:02,515
But now it is like a glue.

282
00:23:03,057 --> 00:23:06,381
Children are glued to them, wife is glued to them

283
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,741
and the family - very important.

284
00:23:09,713 --> 00:23:14,390
This is another temptation from which you have to get out.

285
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,865
I am not saying that you have to give up your family or your child.

286
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:20,291
But, again I say, the detachment.

287
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:24,195
The detachment is your power.

288
00:23:26,378 --> 00:23:29,048
Watch everything with detachment.

289
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:30,667
Now don't think that,

290
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:34,298
 "Oh, I came only a few days back in Sahaja Yoga"...no.

291
00:23:34,537 --> 00:23:38,357
Don't think, "Somebody is higher than me; I am no good" ... no.

292
00:23:38,735 --> 00:23:44,865
You just introspect yourself and see for yourself

293
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:49,687
how many powers you have already got.

294
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:55,056
And the more you'll know, the more you'll become humble.

295
00:23:56,009 --> 00:24:00,135
It's very surprising. You'll become humble.

296
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,925
No fear of any kind.

297
00:24:03,123 --> 00:24:06,587
You can have fear if you have some,

298
00:24:06,787 --> 00:24:08,653
say, lot of money with you.

299
00:24:08,892 --> 00:24:13,116
If you are very well educated, you might have fear of jealousies.

300
00:24:13,376 --> 00:24:17,633
If you have other wealth like ornaments and things, you will be

301
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:20,260
afraid of big thieves coming around.

302
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:24,707
If you are a politician, you might be afraid

303
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:29,449
that somebody might take away your seat when you are away.

304
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:36,186
But, when it comes really to Sahaja Yoga, it's the other way round.

305
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,836
Who can steal your Self-realization?

306
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,665
Tell me! Who can steal your powers?

307
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:54,252
Who can steal your vibrations? Think of it.

308
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:59,867
And who can steal your love?

309
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:04,998
Because it is coming from the Spirit,

310
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:09,105
which is eternal, and the flow is all the time there.

311
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,987
Only when you go away from your Spirit,

312
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:19,898
then only you feel all these things,

313
00:25:20,078 --> 00:25:22,211
which one feels in the darkness.

314
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,334
Then another power of Mother is that She gives you

315
00:25:33,612 --> 00:25:37,818
a state in which you are a sakshi, you are a witness,

316
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:39,819
watching everything.

317
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:43,109
You have tremendous patience;

318
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:47,438
tremendous patience.

319
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:50,444
Whatever's happened, all right, let it be.

320
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:53,480
This will be all right, that will be all right, this and that.

321
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,481
So you get rid of a horrible thing called anger.

322
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:05,539
And this gives you such a peaceful witness state,

323
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,798
that you start becoming younger and younger.

324
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,179
I will tell you, some Sahaja Yogis

325
00:26:11,358 --> 00:26:13,738
whom I gave Realization, say, last year,

326
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,657
this year I met them - I could not recognize.

327
00:26:16,816 --> 00:26:19,514
They have suddenly become ten years younger.

328
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:25,320
It's very surprising. And I was Myself,

329
00:26:25,523 --> 00:26:28,545
had to confess that I really, I can't recognize

330
00:26:28,745 --> 00:26:32,905
that are you the same people, or are you the son of that fellow?

331
00:26:37,157 --> 00:26:40,561
So then, what happens to you

332
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,649
is that you become a peaceful personality. Why?

333
00:26:45,501 --> 00:26:48,193
Because your Mother is there always.

334
00:26:48,689 --> 00:26:52,677
This faith: She is always there, She is always with us,

335
00:26:52,815 --> 00:26:54,989
always protecting us:

336
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,839
but now we are grown up, so She has given us all the powers.

337
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:01,609
All the property She has given us; so what,

338
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:04,331
what is there to be afraid of?

339
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:10,756
But this faith has to be not just a blind faith,

340
00:27:10,935 --> 00:27:12,871
but an enlightened faith.

341
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:16,871
Now the difference is, in blind faith

342
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,110
you have faith but no powers.

343
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,278
In enlightened faith, you have faith and all the powers.

344
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:32,109
When that happens to you, you start growing very much fast

345
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:34,462
- first in your dharma.

346
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:37,638
And you are not afraid of your virtues.

347
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:46,287
You tell people, talk about Sahaja Yoga everywhere,

348
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,674
and it works, it clicks.

349
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,853
Once you don't have any fear,

350
00:27:51,993 --> 00:27:54,659
the whole picture will be clear to you,

351
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,173
because you become a visionary:

352
00:27:57,905 --> 00:28:00,372
what we call in Sanskrit "drishtas".

353
00:28:00,604 --> 00:28:04,710
Like see how C. S. Lewis could see our procession.

354
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:09,107
How could William Blake predict our future?

355
00:28:09,345 --> 00:28:10,677
How could

356
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:15,117
Gyaneshwara, wrote about "Pasayadan",

357
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,716
which is a description of all the Sahaja Yogis?

358
00:28:17,861 --> 00:28:21,082
But all the time he is saying, "Now you get up and walk,

359
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:24,138
and do this, you are that, now you've got it."

360
00:28:24,275 --> 00:28:27,175
He is trying to assure people all the time.

361
00:28:27,987 --> 00:28:32,808
How could Rabindranath Tagore see our going to Ganapatipule?

362
00:28:33,424 --> 00:28:35,024
How could it happen?

363
00:28:35,254 --> 00:28:38,639
It happens only when people are

364
00:28:38,936 --> 00:28:41,250
in enlightened faith.

365
00:28:45,358 --> 00:28:49,000
In enlightened faith your Mother

366
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,813
gives you another very great power, is of discretion;

367
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,430
of discretion.

368
00:28:55,653 --> 00:28:58,587
Somebody came to me, "Mother, You see,

369
00:28:59,253 --> 00:29:01,784
this gentleman is very good, this, that;

370
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:06,546
and You know nobody has looked after him, this that...

371
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:09,792
He is very well educated, very moneyed person...this, that."

372
00:29:09,971 --> 00:29:12,252
I said: "All right, show Me the photograph."

373
00:29:12,847 --> 00:29:15,458
I saw the photograph. I said: "No

374
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:18,614
- yes,better keep him out. Absolutely.

375
00:29:18,812 --> 00:29:21,391
Keep him out!" He was amazed.

376
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:24,329
"How You say keep him out absolutely?"

377
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:27,554
I saw the photograph, and in the photograph only

378
00:29:27,772 --> 00:29:31,236
how could Mother say that? I could feel the vibrations.

379
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:35,216
Immediately I said: "Is wrong."

380
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:39,701
One gentleman came here and told Me that some

381
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:42,391
Nigerians have written letter to him,

382
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:44,398
that "You put thirty-five

383
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:49,728
thousand pounds in the bank", or something like that,

384
00:29:50,084 --> 00:29:54,421
"and we'll put our money, quite a lot, in millions,

385
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,313
and then you can have one third of that."

386
00:29:58,628 --> 00:30:01,259
He came and told Me this story. I said, "Really?

387
00:30:01,556 --> 00:30:06,932
Keep out of it." So he said, "Why?" " It's a scam."

388
00:30:07,846 --> 00:30:11,250
When he went back to America, they found it was a scam.

389
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:14,128
He said, "Mother, how did you know?"

390
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:17,434
I said: "You can feel the vibrations - so hot!

391
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:20,072
So it is a scam."

392
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,818
You have got vibrations. You can feel your vibrations.

393
00:30:25,937 --> 00:30:29,560
Now if you don't want to use this new awareness,

394
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:32,216
what is the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

395
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:35,542
He was very upset when I told him, "Forget it."

396
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,120
He thought:

397
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,060
"Why Mother is saying so?"

398
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,558
I said: "Now what do you need money for? You need money?

399
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:43,919
All right. We have. Don't take these things."

400
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:49,097
When I told him it's a scam, he got a shock.

401
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:52,788
When he went back, he found out it was a scam. So

402
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:59,407
at the airport only, he was on My feet prostrated.

403
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:00,907
I said, "What happened?"

404
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:03,903
"Mother, You are the limit. What You said is there."

405
00:31:04,023 --> 00:31:08,506
I said: "But it was the vibrations which told Me that he

406
00:31:08,745 --> 00:31:12,693
is a cheat. So, if he says so,

407
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:16,046
that he is going to give you so much money,

408
00:31:16,305 --> 00:31:19,907
is not correct because his vibrations were so very bad."

409
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:29,947
In this way, you can gradually experience.

410
00:31:30,602 --> 00:31:34,783
With the experience, try to put the experience in your heart

411
00:31:35,438 --> 00:31:38,949
and have faith in that experience.

412
00:31:40,636 --> 00:31:44,100
What were you? What have you become now?

413
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:47,574
How many experiences of Sahaja Yoga you had?

414
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:52,951
- of the Mother's attention on you.

415
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:59,292
Now if you have that enlightened faith, enlightened faith in you,

416
00:31:59,611 --> 00:32:01,291
you become powerful...

417
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:06,178
You are powerless, because your faith is like this.

418
00:32:08,896 --> 00:32:14,656
But if you become really a evolved, matured

419
00:32:15,753 --> 00:32:20,297
realized soul, then all your powers will work.

420
00:32:21,922 --> 00:32:24,193
There's a fisherman in India,

421
00:32:40,344 --> 00:32:42,022
who is

422
00:32:42,935 --> 00:32:46,299
- I mean, he is a graduate though he is a fisherman.

423
00:32:46,836 --> 00:32:50,982
So one day, he was going on a boat

424
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:54,871
to another island to do Sahaja Yoga.

425
00:32:55,922 --> 00:32:58,751
And when he came out of his hut, he found

426
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,410
huge big clouds, black ones,

427
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:04,096
hovering and the Vishnumaya playing.

428
00:33:04,823 --> 00:33:06,623
Just he stood on the shore

429
00:33:07,163 --> 00:33:08,960
and told Vishnumaya,

430
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,212
"Please tell these clouds to behave themselves.

431
00:33:12,434 --> 00:33:14,311
I am going for the work of Mother,

432
00:33:14,515 --> 00:33:17,779
and dare not trouble me on the way." Just told it.

433
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:20,834
The people who were with him, told me that

434
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,613
this Harishchandra was talking like that.

435
00:33:23,812 --> 00:33:26,482
They got into the boat. They did the program,

436
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,760
came home. When he went into his boat, the rain started.

437
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:39,042
So you control all five elements by your enlightened faith.

438
00:33:41,097 --> 00:33:44,263
For which you don't even have to say anything.

439
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:47,578
The powers are so great that they act.

440
00:33:47,816 --> 00:33:51,736
See now: today when the Puja was to be done,

441
00:33:51,915 --> 00:33:54,781
suddenly it became pleasant. I didn't ask.

442
00:33:55,506 --> 00:34:00,208
Just it became pleasant, much better than yesterday:

443
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:03,176
could have been very cold.

444
00:34:03,712 --> 00:34:10,708
But this should become again, a faith which is reality.

445
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,132
If you remember last time, we had a horrible rain

446
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,259
and the whole thing was jumping up and people had to

447
00:34:19,498 --> 00:34:22,803
pull all these pillars down.

448
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,625
As soon as they started saying My "Jai", it stopped.

449
00:34:28,558 --> 00:34:31,091
Now, this experience should make you;

450
00:34:31,473 --> 00:34:33,874
there was no need for you to pull the...

451
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,005
these pillars, but you had to just sing My "Jai", that's all.

452
00:34:40,242 --> 00:34:42,197
Instead of that, you were busy with pulling

453
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,000
all of you that thing.

454
00:34:44,153 --> 00:34:46,406
I was just looking at you, I didn't know

455
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,966
what to say anything; I said, "Let them try."

456
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:54,413
So these ordeals also come to make you mature.

457
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:57,460
These ordeals if they are not there,

458
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,888
these ordeals if they do not come,

459
00:35:03,032 --> 00:35:06,083
then you will not supersede them;

460
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:08,563
and if you will not supersede them,

461
00:35:08,722 --> 00:35:11,256
you will not know what is your faith.

462
00:35:11,817 --> 00:35:15,110
A person who is standing on the shore

463
00:35:15,408 --> 00:35:17,570
will say, "I don't know how to swim."

464
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,777
But supposing you made him jump into the water

465
00:35:20,937 --> 00:35:25,043
and he swims, then he knows that he can swim.

466
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:30,170
Because you do not know what you have become.

467
00:35:31,472 --> 00:35:33,806
You do not know that you can swim.

468
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,059
You do not know that you can also save others.

469
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:38,671
You are still busy

470
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:41,377
with small, small, little, little things here and there.

471
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:46,773
But if you just know what you have become,

472
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:55,539
then you are going to completely change.

473
00:35:56,334 --> 00:36:02,912
Your smallness, which looks like a little particle,

474
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:05,162
will cover the whole sky.

475
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:09,837
But this power that is within you,

476
00:36:10,286 --> 00:36:11,966
will not give you ego.

477
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:15,765
One thing, the test is, it makes you humble.

478
00:36:17,331 --> 00:36:20,414
This is one of the things: that it makes you humble,

479
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:23,221
and extremely loving and compassionate.

480
00:36:23,402 --> 00:36:27,690
You will not hurt other people with these powers; that's the sign:

481
00:36:27,946 --> 00:36:32,640
it is Mother's love, power of Mother's love.

482
00:36:33,077 --> 00:36:37,164
A person who has a mother, very loving and nice,

483
00:36:37,343 --> 00:36:39,143
it's a psychological fact,

484
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:41,819
becomes a very nice person;

485
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,389
it's a psychological fact.

486
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,997
So now if you realize what you are now,

487
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,075
what you have become.

488
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:56,162
Navaratri Puja is, that's why, is a very, very

489
00:36:56,321 --> 00:36:57,948
powerful Puja in a way:

490
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,015
because it manifests, opens out

491
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,750
the channels of your power, that's why it's very, very
important;

492
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:14,749
and since morning I have been just

493
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:19,483
flowing with vibrations, tremendous, it was like a

494
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:22,915
waterfall of vibrations.

495
00:37:23,094 --> 00:37:26,288
And the whole time I am seeing light, light, light, light; I was

496
00:37:26,448 --> 00:37:30,356
thinking, "Now I don't know what am I going to speak or something"

497
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:32,173
That's why I closed My eyes,

498
00:37:32,332 --> 00:37:34,812
because all the time there will be something else

499
00:37:34,971 --> 00:37:37,471
I will be seeing and not you people; so better, I thought,

500
00:37:37,551 --> 00:37:39,151
I'll close My eyes.

501
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:45,225
But now you are the light. You are the light.

502
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:50,583
Light is not afraid of darkness, is it?

503
00:37:52,151 --> 00:37:54,617
Because, it can remove the darkness.

504
00:37:55,345 --> 00:37:58,801
That's what you are, but you don't know what you are,

505
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:03,757
and you live with very small, very small

506
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:06,542
ideas about yourself.

507
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:12,049
I am not saying that you should become like gurus

508
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:16,832
that go round talking big, with two horns on their head, no.

509
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:20,141
What is your decoration is your humility,

510
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,899
is your kindness, is your sweetness,

511
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,244
and the way you handle people.

512
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,387
You will be amazed, I also tell people

513
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:34,376
when I find there is something wrong with them. I also do it,

514
00:38:34,555 --> 00:38:37,153
no doubt; but in a way

515
00:38:37,435 --> 00:38:40,002
that the person understands it is for the

516
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,960
benevolence of that person.

517
00:38:42,412 --> 00:38:49,658
So the whole personality, the whole temperament,

518
00:38:50,804 --> 00:38:57,034
everything changes; the whole face changes;

519
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:00,657
the whole movement changes.

520
00:39:00,836 --> 00:39:02,836
The style of talking changes,

521
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:08,890
automatically as if you know the machinery has changed, within.

522
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:17,879
So you develop the qualities of a real Mahayogi.

523
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:27,156
This Mahayogi condition is achieved by many people also before,

524
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:37,593
but they had to go through very circuitous life.

525
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,358
They had to give up everything, not to show, but

526
00:39:43,518 --> 00:39:46,318
really from the heart they had to detach.

527
00:39:46,613 --> 00:39:50,502
They had to get out of it, go to some far-fetched places,

528
00:39:51,018 --> 00:39:53,022
and live on ordinary food.

529
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:56,863
All kinds of even Buddha suffered so much.

530
00:39:57,616 --> 00:39:59,671
Christ suffered so much.

531
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:02,985
They were Incarnations but still they had to suffer.

532
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:07,640
Rama suffered so much; Shri Krishna suffered so much: imagine.

533
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:10,769
Now you people didn't have to suffer.

534
00:40:11,331 --> 00:40:14,595
On the contrary you all came out of the suffering:

535
00:40:15,755 --> 00:40:18,929
enjoyment, music, everything.

536
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:30,303
But to enjoy Sahaja Yoga, in Niranand

537
00:40:30,878 --> 00:40:35,329
- absolutely without anything else but joy -

538
00:40:36,321 --> 00:40:42,880
then one has to know that he should give up all the myths

539
00:40:43,195 --> 00:40:45,112
with which he is living.

540
00:40:45,315 --> 00:40:47,215
All kinds of myths there are.

541
00:40:47,354 --> 00:40:49,298
Some people have myths: "We are very poor".

542
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,063
Some have myths: "We are very rich".

543
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,171
Some have this thing that "We are very unhappy".

544
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:58,100
Some have that "We are very happy".

545
00:40:58,279 --> 00:41:00,279
All kinds of myths these are.

546
00:41:00,957 --> 00:41:03,933
These are all myths.

547
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:08,528
What is the thing is the complete emptiness;

548
00:41:09,084 --> 00:41:13,250
complete emptiness. That is joy.

549
00:41:14,362 --> 00:41:17,052
This emptiness is filled with joy.

550
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:19,089
Complete emptiness.

551
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:22,234
Then you don't expect anything from anyone.

552
00:41:22,457 --> 00:41:26,263
And this emptiness from within is actually,

553
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:31,581
gives chance to compassion and love to enter into you.

554
00:41:31,938 --> 00:41:34,628
Supposing there is something in a pot already,

555
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:36,607
what can you pour into it?

556
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,921
What can you give into it?

557
00:41:40,621 --> 00:41:44,005
So if you are completely empty within,

558
00:41:44,303 --> 00:41:47,913
there's nothing of this nonsense of the past and the future:

559
00:41:48,053 --> 00:41:51,253
the aspirations, the ambitions, all those things,

560
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:55,874
and falsehood. If you just become empty,

561
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:59,914
it is filled in with nothing but joy,

562
00:42:00,113 --> 00:42:03,825
and joy of such a eternal nature. You never asked for it;

563
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,267
you do not look forward to it.

564
00:42:07,406 --> 00:42:10,238
It is there, all the time.

565
00:42:10,814 --> 00:42:15,675
And this is what I wish today you people can feel it.

566
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:18,465
As you know, the Devi's things are

567
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:22,480
so very deep and subtle:

568
00:42:23,393 --> 00:42:29,655
how She took the form of a Mother and how She looked after

569
00:42:29,993 --> 00:42:33,385
Her bhaktas with love;

570
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,639
how She fought demons

571
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:38,895
and also negativity.

572
00:42:40,508 --> 00:42:44,269
But now the demons have entered into your hearts;

573
00:42:45,005 --> 00:42:48,141
these false gurus have entered into your brains.

574
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:52,028
Through these horrible books so many things are coming,

575
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:54,519
all the time attacking you.

576
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,519
Even if you kill those demons,

577
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:01,832
still they'll be lingering in your heads.

578
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:04,610
They should be actually killed when they,

579
00:43:04,789 --> 00:43:09,602
once they are reflected into your mind, have gone away.

580
00:43:10,218 --> 00:43:13,967
Then only it's possible to eliminate them.

581
00:43:14,146 --> 00:43:18,701
Otherwise they will go away but leave their bhoots into your heads.

582
00:43:19,198 --> 00:43:22,046
So these negativities, which come

583
00:43:22,343 --> 00:43:25,775
from wrong type of following you have had,

584
00:43:25,934 --> 00:43:27,919
from wrong books you have been reading,

585
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,917
also in Sahaja Yoga when you come,

586
00:43:30,062 --> 00:43:33,262
you can be misled by some people - it's possible.

587
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:37,137
In that case also, forgive that person.

588
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:40,054
That person may improve, but you may continue

589
00:43:40,259 --> 00:43:44,291
with the same ideas and funny things and will suddenly come up.

590
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:53,995
So the quality is of compassion and love,

591
00:43:54,748 --> 00:43:57,281
fearlessness and courage

592
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,324
and the complete emptiness.

593
00:44:04,238 --> 00:44:08,416
In this emptiness, then, you are not worried about

594
00:44:08,714 --> 00:44:11,967
what you have to achieve, how many people

595
00:44:12,186 --> 00:44:13,983
you have to gather,

596
00:44:14,182 --> 00:44:17,852
how many must come to Sahaja Yoga - not bothered about that.

597
00:44:17,976 --> 00:44:21,931
Automatically it will work out, but you would not desire for it,

598
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,364
and you will not hanker: "Oh my God,"

599
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,865
say, "There is not many people, what to do?" this, that.

600
00:44:28,015 --> 00:44:29,857
It is good for us in a way,

601
00:44:30,056 --> 00:44:34,088
because where is the place in heaven for so many stupid people?

602
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:41,833
So we should not run after people who are negative and useless.

603
00:44:42,864 --> 00:44:47,209
But we must definitely take over the people

604
00:44:47,409 --> 00:44:50,722
who are genuinely good.

605
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,401
One thing more I would like to tell you,

606
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:57,460
that automatically such people are dropped out in Sahaja Yoga.

607
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:01,190
In one shot they will go away.

608
00:45:01,528 --> 00:45:04,742
They don't stay, because they don't deserve to be there.

609
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,928
They don't deserve to have the Mother's powers.

610
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:13,167
So this happens in a very beautiful, subtle manner.

611
00:45:13,365 --> 00:45:17,821
And I see, I go late always to any program,

612
00:45:18,278 --> 00:45:21,762
so those who are useless just disappear.

613
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,226
And some of them disappear half-way through,

614
00:45:25,443 --> 00:45:27,952
because nothing goes into their head, really,

615
00:45:28,151 --> 00:45:31,287
they don't understand anything, so they go away.

616
00:45:31,781 --> 00:45:35,685
So now the ones which are left are the real seekers of truth

617
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,887
and they get, all of them, Realization.

618
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:41,261
In Sanskrit they call it "cheyen"

619
00:45:41,419 --> 00:45:45,963
- means "selection". This is a natural selection that takes place,

620
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:51,657
and how people go away and how they come back

621
00:45:52,034 --> 00:45:55,121
to Sahaja Yoga, it's very interesting.

622
00:45:56,927 --> 00:46:01,014
This is a common happening in Sahaja Yoga, you know.

623
00:46:01,193 --> 00:46:02,692
You should not get upset.

624
00:46:02,832 --> 00:46:05,968
Now if you get too many people, say from Russia,

625
00:46:06,244 --> 00:46:08,121
and not so much from Switzerland,

626
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:12,121
maybe you might think that way; but now it's not that bad.

627
00:46:14,185 --> 00:46:19,919
Then we should not worry, because we are no more Russians or Swiss.

628
00:46:20,713 --> 00:46:26,189
We are superhuman beings, we are Sahaja Yogis.

629
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:30,134
Whether they are Russians or whether they are Indians

630
00:46:30,275 --> 00:46:33,142
or from some African land, it's all right.

631
00:46:34,779 --> 00:46:38,235
As long as they are Sahaja Yogis, we should be happy.

632
00:46:39,281 --> 00:46:43,341
If the Swiss are coming to Sahaja Yoga, we should be happy.

633
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:45,512
So this attachment, in a way,

634
00:46:45,651 --> 00:46:48,809
is good to begin with, that you want to bring more Swiss,

635
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,794
because you want to have company.

636
00:46:50,953 --> 00:46:55,437
Now you can't live with one person in a jungle,

637
00:46:55,734 --> 00:46:58,722
with all the others non-Sahaja Yogis, you see

638
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:01,016
- difficult. So you want to have company.

639
00:47:01,145 --> 00:47:03,685
So you want to have more and more and more.

640
00:47:03,805 --> 00:47:05,014
But doesn't matter.

641
00:47:05,194 --> 00:47:07,394
As many as there are sufficient,

642
00:47:07,674 --> 00:47:11,130
and we shouldn't worry about those things, the number.

643
00:47:11,683 --> 00:47:15,147
But when we want to share our love,

644
00:47:15,405 --> 00:47:19,234
then we do feel the dearth. Not because we are Swiss,

645
00:47:19,373 --> 00:47:21,607
but because we cannot share.

646
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:25,686
That time a new personality rises,

647
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:31,143
and this new personality is the one which works.

648
00:47:31,737 --> 00:47:34,288
I mean we are not giving you any money;

649
00:47:34,448 --> 00:47:36,382
there are no awards for you.

650
00:47:36,591 --> 00:47:39,457
There's no way there's much encouragement,

651
00:47:39,627 --> 00:47:42,734
like we have your sort of a picture hanging here,

652
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,440
nothing of the kind.

653
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:47,516
Can you imagine in any organization

654
00:47:47,635 --> 00:47:51,008
anybody would work like this, the way you work? Nobody would.

655
00:47:51,187 --> 00:47:54,948
They give you awards, they give you bonuses,

656
00:47:55,861 --> 00:47:58,440
also they give you promotions;

657
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,262
they do all kinds of things, you see, to keep you going.

658
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,091
But we don't do anything in Sahaja Yoga.

659
00:48:05,707 --> 00:48:08,715
So what makes you work so hard in Sahaja Yoga,

660
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,393
what makes you spread Sahaja Yoga?

661
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:14,688
Only thing is that you want to share.

662
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,323
You can't help it,

663
00:48:17,522 --> 00:48:19,522
it's like a drunkard you see.

664
00:48:19,686 --> 00:48:21,293
If he has a bottle,

665
00:48:21,412 --> 00:48:24,676
he must have at least one person to share with him,

666
00:48:25,143 --> 00:48:32,047
because he thinks that it would be sinful:

667
00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:35,297
"As it is I am doing sin, why not share with somebody else?"

668
00:48:35,397 --> 00:48:37,664
So it would be half-half divided.

669
00:48:47,259 --> 00:48:55,683
But in Sahaja Yoga you share it; you want to spread it.

670
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:00,318
It is because you are collective;

671
00:49:00,775 --> 00:49:03,442
you have become collective, that's why.

672
00:49:04,267 --> 00:49:08,275
You want more to come in, more to join, to enjoy.

673
00:49:08,493 --> 00:49:11,301
You become a very noble person, you see?

674
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:13,437
Like, of course drunkards do that,

675
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:17,468
but supposing somebody has a lottery, or some,

676
00:49:17,647 --> 00:49:21,210
he gets a very big business, he won't like to share.

677
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:27,162
But you think that "Why not? If I am so much enjoying,

678
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:28,621
why not others?

679
00:49:29,923 --> 00:49:34,082
Why not people have the same bliss as I have?"

680
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,399
So because you become extremely noble, so noble,

681
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:43,082
you work so hard, so very hard to achieve it.

682
00:49:43,717 --> 00:49:47,180
I mean, no words can describe My joy

683
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:51,665
when I see you people working it so spontaneously.

684
00:49:51,884 --> 00:49:55,784
Yesterday I saw the film, the whole drama,

685
00:49:55,943 --> 00:50:01,836
and I was really very much amazed and touched

686
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:09,070
that this Marathi music has come to Cabella.

687
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:14,744
Can you imagine any Italian thinking of it?

688
00:50:15,499 --> 00:50:18,796
Even hundred years to come he would not think.

689
00:50:19,075 --> 00:50:23,541
how it has come so spontaneously and is working out?

690
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,311
Because there is a sense of collectivity.

691
00:50:28,799 --> 00:50:32,192
The "New Age" people talk of is here, no doubt.

692
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:37,097
This is the New Age, and new consciousness is also there.

693
00:50:37,395 --> 00:50:40,595
But what is the "new" now is the new collectivity,

694
00:50:41,442 --> 00:50:45,351
and that collectivity acts, that you want to spread:

695
00:50:45,529 --> 00:50:51,283
it acts, like your hunger, it is another kind of hunger,

696
00:50:51,592 --> 00:50:54,401
that you want to create more Sahaja Yogis,

697
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:57,072
you want to have more brothers and sisters,

698
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:01,060
and you want to help them so that they could come to the Pujas

699
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:04,066
and all that and become good Sahaja Yogis.

700
00:51:04,215 --> 00:51:09,961
Now this kind of an ambition or a joy or whatever you may call it,

701
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,870
is the whole plan, shows that in your heart,

702
00:51:14,128 --> 00:51:17,056
the collectivity is prospering.

703
00:51:17,692 --> 00:51:21,521
And that's why you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga alone,

704
00:51:21,739 --> 00:51:23,739
sitting in the Himalayas -no.

705
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,067
You want to have other people.

706
00:51:26,422 --> 00:51:31,791
This is now the sign of how the Mother's love has taken roots

707
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:37,207
in your hearts and how you are all going to spread Sahaja Yoga.

708
00:51:38,815 --> 00:51:43,627
Of course I'm told that somebody in Australia making money

709
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,108
- Australia has been always a problem -

710
00:51:46,307 --> 00:51:48,640
they are making money out of this;

711
00:51:48,736 --> 00:51:50,815
so I just don't know what to say,

712
00:51:50,978 --> 00:51:53,640
because this is, I can't understand.

713
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:57,918
How can they think of making money or doing all kinds of things,

714
00:51:58,057 --> 00:52:03,076
and doing all kinds of asahaj things?

715
00:52:05,954 --> 00:52:09,834
Some sort of a headache comes up, doesn't matter.

716
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,563
Leave it to Me. I'll manage it,

717
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:17,890
whatever it is; but you just become great lights of your Mother.

718
00:52:18,247 --> 00:52:21,275
That's what I have to request you tonight.

719
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:26,235
You have all the power flowing in you,

720
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:30,612
you have the light which is enlightened,

721
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:32,953
but you must expand.

722
00:52:34,164 --> 00:52:36,715
Expand it more and more and more,

723
00:52:36,974 --> 00:52:40,128
and you will be surprised what Tukarama has said,

724
00:52:40,406 --> 00:52:43,977
that, "I am like a small little particle of dust,

725
00:52:44,255 --> 00:52:47,176
and also I am the whole sky."

726
00:52:50,271 --> 00:52:54,954
This is what is your personality.

727
00:52:55,271 --> 00:52:57,750
May God bless you all.
