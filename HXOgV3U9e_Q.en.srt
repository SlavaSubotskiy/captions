1
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:14,200
Today, we have decided to have a Vishnumaya
Puja. In this context, one has to know who

2
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:26,329
is this Vishnumaya and what is Her – you
can call it mythological [Shri Mataji laughs

3
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:33,609
gently] – but a historical relationship.
I have told you that America is the country

4
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:42,079
of Shri Krishna and He’s Kubera, as well
as He’s Yama. Because He’s Kubera, people

5
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,729
have got their affluence, they are rich people,
they have money, more than anywhere else,

6
00:01:48,729 --> 00:02:03,159
but if you do not remember, that you have
to have balance, and that Shri Krishna’s

7
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:19,849
power is of Mahalakshmi. So Mahalakshmi Principle
is such that where seeking is important, Vishnu

8
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:29,650
Principle is there when Shri Lakshmi is His
power. After getting the Lakshmi up to a certain

9
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:39,060
point, then you jump into a new awareness
or a new sort of a seeking which is the seeking

10
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:45,890
of the spirit where the Mahalakshmi principle
starts, the central path.

11
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,829
That far, of course, in America it started,
the Mahalakshmi Principle, but people did

12
00:02:52,829 --> 00:03:04,879
not know, they had no discretion to know which
way to go for their seeking and so many got

13
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:12,099
enamoured by false advertisements, by all
kinds of promises, claims and things and I

14
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:19,959
came here long time back at that moment where
I knew that the seeking now is showing results

15
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:27,469
and that all the people from all over the
world will try to come down here because there

16
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:37,969
was a market for them and their marketing
will start in such a manner that these people

17
00:03:37,969 --> 00:04:08,799
who are used to marketing will fall into it.
I came here, I think I was the first to arrive,

18
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,989
I warned them, I told them names of the people
who will be doing all this kind of work. Also

19
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,220
I told them what were they in their last lives,
what kind of a thing they did, what kind of

20
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,220
work they did, what are their negatives powers
and how they tried to manipulate. But nobody

21
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:34,349
would listen to me. Because these people found
out that the weaknesses of Americans, if you

22
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:43,759
can pamper them, pamper their ego, and tell
them that this is something very important,

23
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:57,750
that you should do something – ah- that
is very superficial but something looks fantastic

24
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:03,990
as I told you that they said : you can fly
three feet height. And the Americans took

25
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,710
to it. All such absurd ideas, they took to
it because they thought it was something new,

26
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:18,349
something different and they wouldn’t listen
to Me because I said I won’t take money.

27
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:24,060
And they told Me very clearly that “Nobody
will understand you if you don’t take money.”

28
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,280
So I said how much will you pay Me which is
so invaluable? How much money are you going

29
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,860
to pay Me?” And they had no answer.
So those people who were still money-oriented,

30
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,550
so the Mahalakshmi Principle was not in them
to understand that if you have to seek the

31
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:47,319
truth, you cannot pay for it. They couldn’t
understand that and that is how they had to

32
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:55,330
go through all this circle of facing all kinds
of false gurus, all types, all superficial

33
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:01,409
things.
Ultimately now, I think, first year I feel

34
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:14,560
everything has come up very well, but one
of the chakras of this Vishuddhi is, as you

35
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,020
know, very important, is the Left Vishuddhi.
And the Left Vishuddhi is the centre, if it

36
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:30,190
is caught up, you get angina, you get spondylitis
and also you get lethargic organs. So this

37
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:40,060
Left Vishuddhi has been a sort of a fashion
with the Western people, maybe because of

38
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,979
Christianity where you had to confess and
you have to say you’re a sinner and you’re

39
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:48,340
a born sinner, an original sinner all kinds
of things.

40
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,900
So, as you are branded as sinner, you see,
you always felt guilty and that guilt was

41
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:03,479
built in, in the Left Vishuddhi. I think this
is one of the greatest drawbacks, even today,

42
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:12,789
that people in America feel extremely guilty
for very small things, because they have no

43
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:18,819
confidence in themselves. Firstly, they think
that “We are a very young nation. We had

44
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:26,470
no tradition – basically”. They may look
arrogant, they may look to be very show-offs,

45
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:33,169
but basically inside, they feel that “We
have had no tradition. We are a very young

46
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:41,789
nation.” Like they think that the English
are too over sophisticated or the French are

47
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:47,240
very sophisticated and we are not, compared
to them. We are primitive.” This kind of

48
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:56,530
funny ideas they have. And because of this,
you see, they try to make up. To make it up,

49
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:05,550
the path they followed ended up into all kinds
of things and it built up a very huge Left

50
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:16,930
Vishuddhi in them. That’s why Americans
are having so many problems of the Left Vishuddhi.

51
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:25,060
First of all, this centre catches when you
do not want to face your mistakes. “I’ve

52
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,030
committed this mistake all right, I’ve committed
it, now I’m not going to do it, and why

53
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:34,680
I commit it and why it happened, just face
it.” They don’t want to. They will feel

54
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,900
guilty that we have done this or I’ll put
it here. [Shri Mataji puts Her hand on Her

55
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:44,160
left shoulder, close to the neck] Like, they
go on amassing, like very black clouds of

56
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:54,160
guilt.
Then this Vishnumaya, who is the thunder,

57
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:05,780
we can call, who is the electrical charge,
which is liberated by the friction of these

58
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:17,660
black clouds, which actually is a catalyst
for rain. It’s a catalyst for rain. This

59
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:32,760
starts acting on such people, that is, they
suddenly get a shock. They become extremely

60
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:44,830
sensitive people. They get nervous and this
nervousness can make, makes them think “Why

61
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:51,100
are we nervous? What is the problem?” Like
the exposure of their guilt comes through

62
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,510
the Vishnumaya Power.
Now I have to tell you about also the origin

63
00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:01,020
of Vishnumaya, which is very interesting.
Vishnumaya was the sister of Shri Krishna,

64
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:09,040
who was born after Shri Krishna was born.
Actually She was not His own sister, but She

65
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:19,120
was a daughter of Nanda. And when Shri Krishna
was taken over and was put in the care of

66
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:27,350
Nand and Yeshoda they gave their own daughter
in His place and the father of Shri Krishna

67
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:35,870
brought it back [in the castle]. So when Kamsa
came – the uncle- you all know about the

68
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,870
story – to ask about the eighth child, they
said, “This is the child.” He said, “But

69
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:50,070
this’s not a man. This is a woman.” He
took the child in his hand and did like this

70
00:10:50,070 --> 00:11:00,600
and threw it in the sky. And there She went
and there She announced that : “Shri Krishna

71
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:11,070
is already incarnated, He is living and He
is your killer.” So She is the announcer.

72
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:18,040
She is the announcer of the incarnations.
She is the announcer of something good that

73
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:33,560
is going to happen to you. Also She’s the
one who can burn things, which are not spiritually

74
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:41,420
all right.
At the time of Mahabharata, She was born as

75
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:52,950
Draupadi and this Draupadi was the sister
of Shri Rama and when, as you know in Mahabharata

76
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:59,910
– all of you know the story of Mahabharata,
I need not tell that – Duryodhana tried

77
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:06,980
to take out Her clothes. Then She called for
Krishna. First She said, “Kri.” She had

78
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:13,280
put Her teeth like this [Shri Mataji holds
her own sari with her teeth]. Till She had

79
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,460
said, “Krish,” [the sari] it was there.
Because She was thinking if She said “shna,”

80
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:27,140
the thing will fall down and She ‘ll become
exposed. As soon as She said, “Krishna,”

81
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:34,670
the thing fell down and that’s the time
Shri Krishna came all the way from Dwarika

82
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:40,160
and Tulsida has here described it very well
in Hindi language : “Dwarika me Shabad gayo

83
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:48,420
[message went to Dwarika]”. In Dwarika,
there was a big – big noise, you can call

84
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:58,180
it or what I don’t know. “Shor bhayo,
shor bhayo bhare [caused comotion ; shora:

85
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,320
noise, bhare : to fill] – tremendous, what
you call the – thunder, you can call it,

86
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:10,190
because She was the one who’s responsible
for thunder. “Shor bhayo bhare, Shankha

87
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:17,560
(conch) Chakra (disc) Gada Padma (weapon)
Garuda le sidhare” With the shankar, with

88
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:26,610
Chakra, with Garuda, with Padma, all of them,
He came on the Garuda. With all His weapons,

89
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:37,520
He came on a Garuda to help Her. He started
supplying the saris to Her and this Duryodhana

90
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:45,980
got absolutely – Dushansana did that – got
absolutely tired and he fell on the ground.

91
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:53,500
So now here, Vishnumaya is the one who is
the virgin. Not only that She is a virgin,

92
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:02,040
but She exists in all the five elements as
shown that She married five Pandavas and that

93
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:19,760
this power of virginity in Her used to expose
people to the dangers of these horrible Kauravas

94
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:30,620
who were going to rule and destroy the dharma.
So She stood back and She is the one who said

95
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:36,670
that “You have to fight. You have to fight
for dharma, whatever may happen” and Krishna

96
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:43,470
always supported Her. So as a brother, Shri
Krishna supported Her, so the relationship

97
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:51,300
between brother and sister are very important
in India. Also should be with Sahaja Yogis

98
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,050
because we have raki bandhan. You also have
what you call the bhaiya duj [Hindi; Bhau

99
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:03,370
bij in Marathi], where on Diwali day we tie
up a raki to the Brother. Now this raki is

100
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:09,250
nothing but the Vishnumaya’s power, which
protects the brother. Actually, there the

101
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:14,980
brother protected Her and now the sister’s
love protects the brother. So the relationship

102
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:21,220
between brother and sister is much more important
than any other relationship because it’s

103
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:29,320
so pure, it’s so protective, it’s so loving
and also it is of an equal age.

104
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:36,480
For example, between the parents and the children,
cannot be that or say, between the grandparents

105
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,610
and the children can be quite imbalanced also.
But between the brother and sister they’re

106
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:49,430
of the same age group, same understanding
and this relationship is maintained by this

107
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:55,900
Vishnumaya.
We have a very good incident of that in India,

108
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:03,430
which I must tell you, how this Rakhi Bandhan
or this relationship between brother and sister

109
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:10,120
is respected. I mean nobody will believe because
in these countries where there is no relationship

110
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,600
which is respected, we won’t understand.
But when Alexander the Great came to India,

111
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:23,550
he conquered our country quite a lot. But
there was one king Poru, who defeated him

112
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:32,680
and put him in jail. Alexander had married
an Indian lady. So it was a day of this Rakhi

113
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:40,980
Purnima. She put one rakhi in one plate and
covered it up and sent it to this king Poru.

114
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:46,090
So they said : “a rakhi has come.” So
the King said : “All right, tie up the rakhi.”

115
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,360
He didn’t know whose rakhi it was and it
was tied. He said, “Who’s rakhi it was?”

116
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,070
“It’s your sister’s.” “Who is my
sister?” “She is the wife of this King

117
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:03,590
Alexander.” “Oh, my God! How could I do
such a thing? He is my brother-in-law.”

118
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:12,120
He immediately went to the jail and prostrated
before him. He said, “I’m sorry. Whatever

119
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:19,429
I -”. This is the graciousness, you understand.
“How could I be – how could I be so stupid

120
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:26,019
as to arrest you?” Alexander was flabbergasted.
He couldn’t understand this reaction. He

121
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:35,529
said, “What’s this going on?” And he
said that “Now, I ask for your forgiveness

122
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:41,559
and please come out.” With great pomp and
show, with ornaments for his sister and all

123
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:48,279
that, he sent the brother-in-law home. Now
this Alexander could not understand. He went

124
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:53,970
in and his wife was smiling. He said, “What’s
the matter? How am I here?” She said, “Do

125
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:59,809
you know, I have saved you with one thread?”
She showed him a rakhi. “With this thread

126
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:05,940
you saved me? How?” She said, “You know
what is today? Is a day when a sister can

127
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:13,549
tie this to a brother and the brother has
to do what sister wants. So I said I sent

128
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:22,210
it to this Poru, the king, and he has released
you.” Alexander thought, “What sort people

129
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:27,340
these Indians are? On one thread they release
such an enemy like me. How can I rule this

130
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,070
people? They’ll put me out any time, so
symbolic they are.” He said, “All right,

131
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:38,490
I am sorry.” He took one fellow called Bardai,
Chanda Bardai, took him down – he was a

132
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,870
poet with him, and he said, : “Now, you
write poetry because Indians are very subtle

133
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,860
people and I can’t understand how can they
release such a horrible enemy like me, only

134
00:18:48,860 --> 00:19:00,250
on a thread?” Such trust, such understanding
of a brother for a sister and the sister has

135
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:07,080
to keep the trust also.
So now when we go deeper into it and see for

136
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:18,029
ourselves, our Vishuddhi problems is this
that we always try, in the West, to feel guilty

137
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:28,070
and get out of our mistakes. For small, small
things feel guilty, people, because the norms

138
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:35,250
in the West – Western life are so rigid,
like if you put a spoon on the other side,

139
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:41,200
finished. I mean what does it matter? You
can take it on this side and eat it. If you

140
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:50,620
spill some coffee, then that guilt will last
all your life. After all coffee is to be spilt.

141
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:57,570
[big laughs] If it is hot, it can happen,
some accident can take place. And the guilt

142
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:04,899
business is so great that nobody corrects
oneself, just go on feeling guilty, guilty,

143
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:12,929
guilty, guilty. And all the subtleties of
life you start missing. In Sahaja Yoga, specially,

144
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:19,870
to feel guilty means all your left side is
caught up. You cannot feel the vibrations

145
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:25,340
properly because this is the cervical nerve
on which your guilt is sitting and it’s

146
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:32,159
just clamping it, you cannot feel the left
side. You start catching on the left side

147
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:41,399
till you receive some sort of a horrible disease,
then you realize.

148
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:51,419
The subtler part of this Vishnumaya is that
She knows the truth. When She shines you can

149
00:20:51,419 --> 00:21:02,080
see everything out of Her. Even for a short
time, She exposes in the darkness everything.

150
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:11,659
In the same way, when Vishnumaya starts acting
on you, then She exposes the truth to you.

151
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:21,120
But supposing you continue with your left
Vishuddhi too much, then She just disappears.

152
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,980
She’s not there to correct you, to help
you in any way or to expose you. Then you

153
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:34,779
don’t feel anything. You become numb on
the left side, absolutely numb on the left

154
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:46,210
side and the left side is, know, is the indicator
of all kinds of left side diseases. This is

155
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:53,080
one of the reasons that we have the maximum
number of left-sided diseases in the West

156
00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:01,460
than in India. Indian diseases are from right
side while the left-sided diseases come from

157
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:10,870
this left Vishuddhi. So to feel guilty, itself
is wrong and is a mythical thing.

158
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:20,070
Now you feel guilty for something. What’s
the use of feeling guilty? It’s just a myth.

159
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:27,009
It’s an empty thing you are carrying upon
yourself. No use feeling guilty. If you think

160
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:32,769
you have done something wrong, just face it.
That I have done this wrong and I will not

161
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:38,190
do it again. But if you feel guilty, then
you see, it’s like a stored up stuff there

162
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,909
and then again you do the same mistake. Again
you do the same mistake and you become immune,

163
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:51,700
immune to your development. Then you start
not even feeling that it is wrong, you know.

164
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:58,850
People do wrong things even without thinking
that it is wrong. Even that consciousness

165
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:05,639
or, you can say, that alertness is finished.
Then you think, “What’s wrong?” For

166
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:11,960
anything, this is a very good answer, “What’s
wrong?” It’s like a drunkard, he starts

167
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,870
drinking. First he feels, “Oh, I should
not have done.” Then he starts little bit

168
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:20,759
more, then little bit more, little bit more.
Ultimately, he’ll say “What’s wrong?

169
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:21,659
If I’m drinking is perfect.”

170
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:31,499
Anything of that kind starts with left Vishuddhi
because we do not face the mistake. It’s

171
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:39,639
not true that because your tradition has been
very short or anything, it’s only thing

172
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:47,899
your attitude. Because it is Krishna’s place,
especially for Americans, it is very important

173
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:53,409
to face their mistakes and to admit, “All
right, I have done this mistake and I’m

174
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:56,590
not going to do it.”

175
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:03,659
So because they do not want to admit, they
put up this arrogant behavior. I know underneath

176
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:15,460
this arrogant there’s somebody who is very
guilty. They are, actually, here very collective,

177
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:24,759
also, very collective in the sense they will
be worried about Vietnam, Korea, everything.

178
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:29,899
Anything happens in the world they are worried
about. They are, they are the ones who started

179
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:36,409
UN and every sort of thing, you see. Everything
is there. But despite all that, this guilt

180
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:45,119
business makes them very insensitive, very
insensitive to things which are reality.

181
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:53,799
Anything which is negative, they should face
that thing as negative that they don’t face.

182
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:59,769
They will support a country which is despotic
despite the fact they are democratic country.

183
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:06,610
All such things, not only in politics, but
also in day to day life. Then the whole thing

184
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:17,809
becomes such a lifestyle. It becomes a lifestyle.
The whole thing becomes collective. Nobody

185
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:23,600
ever can come and say that this is something
we are doing wrong and we should stop it.

186
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,970
If somebody says that or they say he’s mad,
he’s no good.

187
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:34,600
For Freud, I was telling you that Freud was
denounced by many people and people gave some

188
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:41,320
papers, everything happened, but nobody would
listen to them. And the same thing happened

189
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:48,649
with Sahaja Yoga also. They would not listen
to Me because they have developed a immunity

190
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:58,710
against reality. In everything, whatever is
real they become immune to it. They do not

191
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:09,480
want to face it. ‘That’s too much, much
too much for me.’ With this kind of an attitude,

192
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,990
they had to work out something else and in
that they have gone to the right side. With

193
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,999
that they have developed all kind of machinery,
science, all this, everything. But science

194
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:29,700
is not conclusive. It cannot give you the
totality. It cannot give the reality.

195
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:39,749
So this Vishnumaya shows Her strength. She
does lots of things by which people are frightened.

196
00:26:39,749 --> 00:26:53,480
She can enter into any, any element. She can
permeate. Supposing She enters into a water

197
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:03,049
element, She can create a typhoon. She can
create any kind of disasters. She can enter

198
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:14,429
into Mother Earth and She can create a earthquake.
She can do anything because She has a power

199
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:18,899
to enter into anything. You know that She
can enter into Mother Earth very easily. She

200
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:24,950
can enter into water very easily and when
She gets into it, She becomes the catalyst.

201
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:34,249
And all these problems that you are facing
today in America are because of left Vishuddhi,

202
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:35,639
because of Vishnumaya.

203
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:43,309
I’m happy today’s program has been arranged
for Vishnumaya because this is the power which

204
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:53,139
you Sahaja Yogis should be able to harness
and should be able to worship so that She

205
00:27:53,139 --> 00:28:00,179
sees all of you there and She looks after
you and She maintains your life and looks

206
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,090
after you.

207
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:17,289
Now the most difficult thing is to convince
people in America that money’s not everything.

208
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:27,899
You may have any amount of money, you may
have any amount of so-called pleasures, everything,

209
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:35,460
but still, you can never be satisfied and
you can never be at peace with yourself and

210
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:45,509
you cannot generate peace. Money cannot replace
reality. It’s just there.

211
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:56,509
Now the problem is that people become so addicted
to this money that all value systems start

212
00:28:56,509 --> 00:29:12,480
going down. I was surprised I knew somebody
here who took his own sister for prostitution.

213
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,799
So I said, “What’s this? What are you
doing?”

214
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:19,330
“What’s wrong? We’ll get money.”

215
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:26,909
So whatever can get money, they indulge into.
So there’s no chastity which is the basics,

216
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:38,289
which is the foundation of human beings. As
a result, when you insult this virginity of

217
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:48,210
Vishnumaya, then the Maya – means the – Her
play is that you get AIDS, you get all kinds

218
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:53,899
of other diseases which are incurable and
which are what you can call as the secret

219
00:29:53,899 --> 00:30:08,169
diseases. Because She’s the virgin and because
She respects the virginity. And those who

220
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:15,320
go against, not that virginity is meant only
for women, also meant for men, because everybody

221
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:22,080
has here left Vishuddhi. Here the idea is
that only the virginity is word used for women

222
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:30,929
only. It’s not. Even the men who do not
respect their virginity, their chastity are

223
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:37,429
attacked by Vishnumaya in different ways.
I’m not surprised that Los Angeles, they

224
00:30:37,429 --> 00:30:44,619
say, is in danger all the time, because of
your cinemas you produce, all these things

225
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:48,769
you produce.

226
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:56,019
Of course, I mean now with the Sahaja Yoga
being established very well in Los Angeles,

227
00:30:56,019 --> 00:31:03,609
thing may be averted, but still it’s very
dangerous. It’s one of the most powerful

228
00:31:03,609 --> 00:31:18,009
Shakti is this of Vishnumaya because She plays
the illusion. She creates the Maya also. Also

229
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:27,489
She breaks the Maya and She can burn anything.
Your forest is burning now. Sixty-five hectares

230
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:37,450
of land is burning. Who has done this? Is
nothing but Vishnumaya. Nobody has to take

231
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:45,879
any matchbox for that. She can burn anything
and is Her burning gives you the feeling that

232
00:31:45,879 --> 00:31:56,359
if there’s an electrical charge, as if burnt
with electrical charge. This is very true

233
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:03,649
in so many cases I’ve seen. Those who came
to Me with problems of left Vishuddhi, that

234
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:08,080
they said that, “We think that there’s
some electrical charge coming out of here.”

235
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:18,200
As if it’s the burning of an electrical
shock. This is Vishnumaya’s doing and She’s

236
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:27,460
the one who is the corrector. She corrects.
Don’t feel guilty. Face your problems. It’s

237
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:38,809
sort of when we hide our mistakes in the name
of guilt, when we try to camouflage it, She’s

238
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:51,850
the one who exposes it on individual level,
on collective level, on national level, international

239
00:32:51,850 --> 00:33:01,749
level. Because She can permeate into anything
and this permeation of Hers gives Her such

240
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:15,239
subtleties. But people cannot relate disaster
to their mistakes. They cannot. They don’t

241
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:21,929
understand why such a disaster has taken place,
what has happened.

242
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:33,600
There was a big typhoon that came, came up
to a point and suddenly turned towards Kauai.

243
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:40,389
Now what was the reason for that, to go and
hit Kauai? In Kauai there is a Swayambu of

244
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:48,700
Shiva, is a fact. People are making money
out of it, quite a lot of money and deceiving

245
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:58,169
people. There’s big business going on in
the name of Shiva. So Kauai was hit, not Hawaii

246
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:04,889
so much as Kauai, and it turned suddenly,
no one can understand that.

247
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:11,470
So all these thundering things that are coming
from nature, anything, whether it is earthquake

248
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:21,060
or it is landslide or it could be floods or
it could be typhoon, anything is the work

249
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:29,440
of this Vishnumaya or we can say all natural
catastrophes are brought about by this Vishnumaya.

250
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,919
She has this power to do it. This is the only
way they can shock people, but despite all

251
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:43,370
that shocking, people have to relate these
disasters so their mistakes that they have

252
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:49,520
committed and have nicely kept it here, not
facing it.

253
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:56,440
I’ve heard from some Indian students that
when they came to America some boys asked

254
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,680
them to take drugs and do all other things
also. So they wouldn’t do. They said, “You

255
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,200
are goody-goodies,” this, that. You know,
they just pumped it into their head that,

256
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,250
“You have to do it. You are cowards. You
cannot do it.” And all that. So some of

257
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,560
them said, “All right, we’ll try.” But
what surprised them that they knew it was

258
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,170
wrong while those who were telling them never
thought it was wrong. They thought they have

259
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:27,900
been great martyrs or they have been liberators
and they have got liberties. They couldn’t

260
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,320
understand this.

261
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:38,440
This kind of liberty that they were boasting
of was so destructive. They’d never understood

262
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:46,810
that this is destructive. So once your left
Vishuddhi is absolutely jammed, you lose complete

263
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:56,230
discretion of the chakra here which we call
as Hamsa chakra and then you do not know what

264
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:01,590
is destructive, what is constructive. You
start accepting mostly the destructive thing

265
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:13,660
if your left Vishuddhi is bad. Escape. “So
what. What wrong?” That is how violence

266
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:23,590
has come. That is how all kind of cheating,
corruption has come. “What’s wrong?”

267
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:27,480
Because if you do anything wrong you put it
there. Finished. Stored up.. Again, you do

268
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:34,780
anything, you put it there and till you become
absolutely immune to all destructive action,

269
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:39,310
you go on doing.

270
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:48,920
So to get out of it, what to do. To get out
of this horrible state where you do not feel

271
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:56,780
anything wrong, what is the thing is only
is to take to Sahaja Yoga in a right fashion.

272
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:11,410
First of all, you must face yourself. If you
start facing yourself, you’ll realize that

273
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:19,040
you have committed a mistake. “So this is
the mistake I have committed. Doesn’t matter.

274
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,580
I am not going to feel guilty about it. If
I ever have to do this, I will not do it and

275
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:29,420
I’m not guilty for whatever has happened.
Is the past. Finished.”

276
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:38,640
With this faith in yourself, you can definitely
get rid of your left Vishuddhi. The problem

277
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:46,020
is even if I tell you something, I am worried
that you start feeling guilty about it also.

278
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,680
I mean, I am telling you for something for
your correction. Then you start guilty that,

279
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:56,830
“Oh, I – Mother is saying, so you see,
I did this and -” that you did. At this

280
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:04,690
moment what I am telling you, never to do
it again. And face it. Whatever you did is

281
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:14,490
finished and gone and is forgiven completely,
otherwise Vishnumaya will take over. This

282
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:24,830
is very important because one side is the
leela, it’s a play and it’s all the world

283
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:31,670
is beautiful. The another side is the guilt.

284
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:37,660
So we think that by just feeling guilty, we
are solving all our problems and this side

285
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:43,640
we are enjoying ourselves and this, the guilt
part, is just like a storehouse of a garbage

286
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:51,930
we put there. But we never think this garbage
what it is wrong, it is doing to us. And this

287
00:38:51,930 --> 00:39:00,880
is what it is that Vishnumaya has to burn
this garbage, then She works in Her own ways,

288
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,150
in Her own Maya ways and so many things happen.

289
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:11,600
Like there was a lady and she was very right-sided.
She used to dominate everyone, but nobody

290
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,910
dared tell her that because, if you tell her,
she would come back on you. So nobody wanted

291
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:21,040
to tell her what’s wrong with her. They
said, “All right. Let it be.” But I told

292
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,010
her, “That you see you are very right-sided.
You are dominating everyone. Everybody’s

293
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:29,950
frightened of you.” So she said, “No,
Mother, I’m not.” I said, “All right

294
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:37,550
I’m telling you. You better believe Me or
really you are in for trouble.” And that

295
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:43,960
very day she was getting down from the staircase
and she fell from top to bottom she did and

296
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:49,370
all her right side. She came to Me, “Mother,
you see.” Her right hand is broken. “My

297
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:56,380
right leg is broken. This is broken. That
is broken.” I said, “Then you know what

298
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:03,550
happened.” “I now know why it has happened.”
Then I cured her. She was all right. But what

299
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:10,260
I am trying to tell you that she wouldn’t
listen to Me. So the right-sided people have

300
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:19,180
a special capacity to put everything here.
So I always say that it is the by-product

301
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:32,150
of ego. Those people who try to dominate,
who try to be angry, try to control everyone,

302
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:42,910
they put it down there and then the whole
thing works against them. This is to be understood

303
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:49,170
in a very serious manner, that feeling guilty
is not that you are harming yourself, but

304
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,660
you are harming all others.

305
00:40:52,660 --> 00:41:03,050
Also this Vishnumaya gets very upset with
two other things. One of the things is smoking.

306
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:12,040
If you smoke too much, then this Vishnumaya
gets very angry. She is the one who then causes

307
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:20,970
cancer. She can spoil your throat. I mean,
all kinds of ear, nose, throat problems can

308
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:30,230
come in with the smoking because She doesn’t
like that smoke. She – once, twice, thrice

309
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:37,150
– but once you start smoking and after some
time, “Oh, what’s wrong?” They will

310
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:43,900
quote such and such man who is eighty-three,
he still smokes. See, quoting like this, they

311
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:49,920
have ideals like this. Then you have also
some cinema heroes. “Such and such man,

312
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:57,280
see, he murdered his wife. He’s not – see,
he’s going along.” So we should also murder.

313
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,570
We should also smoke. So the all ideals which
have destroyed themselves become our ideals

314
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:11,080
and we start exactly doing what they are doing
without knowing that how they are destroyed,

315
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,220
we’ll be also destroyed.

316
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:25,340
So this understanding about Vishnumaya’s
powers should be there with us. That if we

317
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:37,990
try to continue with our mistakes and putting
them here, then first thing we become vulnerable

318
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:47,820
to all kinds of diseases. With that if you
are smoking, you can become also very much

319
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:57,760
vulnerable to cancer of the throat. Another
thing which people do not know is the mantras.

320
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,610
If you go on saying any mantra – I mean
in India there are people who will every day,

321
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:11,730
morning get up and say some mantra for about,
say, hundred times, some say it at least three

322
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:17,160
hundred times, five hundred times. They go
on measuring, mantra, mantra, mantra, mantra,

323
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:25,400
like that. Now She’s the mantrika. She’s
the one who gives the power to the mantra.

324
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:33,970
Now if you are not connected to this Divine
Power, then there’s a short-circuiting takes

325
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:39,300
place and if you go on saying this mantra,
you develop all the troubles of the throat,

326
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:45,520
throat cancer. You can develop also stomach,
in the stomach, problems because it is Krishna

327
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:55,120
and Vishnu are the same. You might develop
also the problem of Virata. Because you are

328
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:03,710
reciting a mantra like this, you see – a
telephone, if it is not connected, I go on

329
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:07,700
using it, the telephone will go out of order.

330
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:16,240
In the same way, if you are doing wrong mantras
in the sense that the mantras which are said

331
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:23,470
before you have connection with the Divine,
then they can spoil your left Vishuddhi, like

332
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:32,140
this. This is the style they use in India.
Supposing you are a business man in India.

333
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:37,160
Now a big business man, you have made a lot
of money, now you feel guilty about it because

334
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:43,450
you have made by bad means, also by all kinds
of black-market and all that sort of things.

335
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:52,930
So they’ll make a big temple of Vishnu,
not Vishuddhi but they’ll make a very big

336
00:44:52,930 --> 00:45:00,830
temple of Shri Vishnu and they will create
a kind of image that they are great religious

337
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:06,690
people. Or they’ll have khairat, means they
will distribute food to people or distribute

338
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:13,930
some things to people and feel satisfied.
Here you go on committing any amount of sins,

339
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:24,250
any amount of nonsense and then out of that
money you make a little contribution to Shri

340
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:30,710
Vishnu thinking that Shri Vishnu will be very
happy and will not punish them. But He’s

341
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:35,900
Kubera, what can you give it to Him. He’s
the Kubera. He gives you all the money. He

342
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:46,220
does everything. So how can you give anything
to Kubera who is Himself the Lord of wealth.

343
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:52,280
It’s a very common thing in India, like
there was a bhudan [donating land] thing.

344
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:58,960
I knew of a man who was very corrupt, very
bad person, I mean really, he was really very,

345
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,370
very bad man and he had taken away so much
land from the poor farmers and all that. So

346
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:13,540
he gave one land to Mahatma Gandhi and this
land, this bhudan land was no good, it was,

347
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:20,540
you know, I think why he gave. This land was
so bad that you could not put even cactus

348
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:29,200
there and he was telling everybody, “I have
given so much land to bhudan. I have given

349
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,870
so much land to bhudan.” So trying to sort
of justify himself for taking all the land

350
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:42,010
from the poor and flinching them and then
to do this kind of a generosity.

351
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:51,070
So this is another escape people have, that
do what you like and ultimately be generous.

352
00:46:51,070 --> 00:47:01,460
This kind of gracious covering of your mistakes
can be very misleading. It doesn’t work

353
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:08,010
with Vishnumaya. She knows you out and out
and if you try all these tricks with Her,

354
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:15,650
She will show Her own powers. I would say
all our left side problems come because of

355
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:25,550
Vishnumaya power. She punishes you, as well
as She exposes, as well as She gives you light,

356
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:29,160
as well as She corrects you.

357
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:39,670
With all these powers of Vishnumaya, we should
be very thankful that today we are celebrating

358
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:46,010
Her special puja because I think it is one
of the curses of the West, especially of Americans

359
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:48,190
to feel guilty.

360
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:54,920
So today you all have to promise in your heart
that the mantra is – now She also understands

361
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:01,900
English perhaps – you can say that, “Mother,
I am not guilty at all.” That’s all. If

362
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,940
that is said, She will be very happy. “I’m
not guilty at all. I’m not going to feel

363
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:12,220
guilty.” Once you stop feeling guilty you
will not do wrong things because how will

364
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:17,030
you manage. Because you are not doing, you
cannot put it as guilt, so what’s the use

365
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:21,760
of doing anything wrong. If you do wrong,
it comes on your head, you cannot put it in

366
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:29,540
your left Vishuddhi, so you won’t do anything
wrong. You will immediately understand that

367
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:34,800
if I have to do wrong, I have to face it.
But if there’s a space here, kept where

368
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:42,530
you can put your guilt for your wrong doings
available, then you don’t mind so much.

369
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:46,270
Supposing somebody has a small house, no place
to store, then somebody brings something.

370
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:55,890
Says, “No, no, no, no space here. I am all
ready very full.” It’s like that.

371
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:02,760
So the best thing is to have no guilt at any
cost. I will have no guilt. If I have done

372
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:08,590
mistake, all right I’ll admit I have done
the mistake and I’ll have no guilt at all

373
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:14,640
about it. I’ll face it. You’ll be surprised.
You’ll stop doing wrong things. Definitely

374
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,070
you’ll stop because there’s no space left.

375
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:26,700
So this is very important today to do Vishnumaya’s
thing and I am sure now very happy with the

376
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:32,690
tour of America. This time I’m really happy
because I think it has worked in most of the

377
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:40,580
places very well, and if it has not worked,
one should not feel guilty, but face the problem,

378
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:48,810
why it has not worked and the problem lies
with Sahaja Yogis and nobody else. You shouldn’t

379
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:56,020
blame anybody else for it. Just see yourself,
what mistakes you must have committed. Could

380
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:03,230
be a small or big mistake. Whatever it is,
face it. There’s no harm in saying, “I

381
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:09,470
have done mistake.” But if you say, “Sorry,”
means it goes there, straight off. No, “I

382
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:18,330
have committed a mistake.” To admit that
is very gracious, very beautiful and very

383
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:20,410
kind to yourself for your benevolence.

384
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:27,500
In Sahaja Yoga it’s one of the biggest mantras
for all the Western people. They should all

385
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:35,880
the time say to all the trees, all the nature
around, “I am not guilty”. Your ecological

386
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:43,930
problem will improve because then you won’t
do wrong things to spoil your ecology. You’ll

387
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:48,320
be careful because you spoil it and you’ll
feel guilty, “Oh, I should not have done

388
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:53,620
this. Oh, I should not.” But why did you
do in the first place is the point. So now,

389
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:56,730
next time you are not going to do it.

390
00:50:56,730 --> 00:51:04,000
So many of our problems will be solved if
you face them and correct them boldly. It’s

391
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,390
possible for Sahaja Yogis because you are
separated from your being, you’re away from

392
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:15,210
it. You can see your body, you can see your
mind, you can see your ego, you can see all

393
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:21,700
of those things and you know how to put them
right. You are not that, you know, so you

394
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:28,880
are the spirit and with the light of the spirit
you can correct all these things. But this

395
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,360
guilt is something where it stops you completely
from correcting or doing anything better about

396
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:41,110
it or bringing any constructive thing to your
own mind.

397
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:50,110
This will solve many problems for America,
as well as for all the Western world. Same

398
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:56,040
with the Indians, that they should not think
that if they are generous a little bit they

399
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:00,370
can get rid of their mistakes. See, they have
to face it. It’s a different style. Indians

400
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:08,670
are very clever, you know, they know how to
find excuses and escapes. But after all, it

401
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:15,940
is Vishnumaya. She will show you that there
is no escape, just face it. There’s no need

402
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:23,520
to condemn yourself, no need to, in any way,
degrade yourself or to feel inferior, but

403
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,130
to be superior as the spirit, I see. Like
I would say, “All right, Nirmala, I see

404
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:34,730
you very well now, you did this.” Separate
yourself from yourself. You can talk on the

405
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:41,940
mirror. You can go to the river and talk there
or you can go to an ocean and tell them that,

406
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:47,660
“See, I’ve done this mistake and now I’m
not going to do it.” You can make promises

407
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,490
to all of these elements.

408
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:56,310
Once you make these promises, this Vishnumaya
will receive the message and She won’t enter

409
00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:00,950
into any one of these elements to disturb
you. So you have to go and tell the ocean

410
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:08,720
that, “All right, America is not guilty
for whatever they have done.” Say like that.

411
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,980
If you say is all right, not other people
because I told your genetics are changed.

412
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:20,840
You are different people. Whatever you say,
Vishnumaya will always believe in and everything

413
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,380
will work out very well.

414
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:29,760
But this is a special time, as I told you
before where we call it is the Krita Yuga,

415
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,630
where between the Kali Yuga and Satya Yuga
this time is so important that whatever mistakes

416
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:40,010
we have committed, we have to pay for it.
Is a karmaphala [consequences of past deeds].

417
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:44,240
It won’t work out by just putting it here.

418
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:52,910
So one has to get to realization, change the
genetics completely and then you can go and

419
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:58,220
tell the nature that, “All right, we are
not guilty now. We have got our realization.”

420
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:04,660
And it will work, I am sure. So many of catastrophes
of this country can be avoided by you Sahaja Yogis.

421
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,820
May God bless you!
