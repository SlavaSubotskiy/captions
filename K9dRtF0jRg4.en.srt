[Hindi/Marathi]

42
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,880
[Hindi/Marathi]

43
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,040
It is such a fortunate day today,

44
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,040
that we should come on the birth of Shri Ganesha

45
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,920
– today is Vinayak Chaturthi, today -

46
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,240
that we should celebrate this Puja.

47
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,880
Also, it is so fortunate to have people like

48
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,000
Dr Sanghvi, his wife and his son, his daughter-in-law,

49
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,520
who are so much dedicated to Sahaja Yoga.

50
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,440
In 1972 I had visited Pune, Nasik,

51
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,280
and we had a big session here.

52
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,200
People from all over came; we got a lot of Sahaja yogis here.

53
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,880
Raulbai is one of them.

54
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,800
But the people of Nasik did not come forward much to do Sahaja Yoga,

55
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,280
and sort of, we didn’t find any

56
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,640
footing place here, so we gave up coming to Nasik.

57
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,760
And today after so many days, now I’m back here.

58
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,480
And it’s so surprising how we have been able to manage.

59
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,120
So many people yesterday, about,

60
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,160
they are saying about ten thousand people were present.

61
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,880
And at least, I would say that ninety percent people

62
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,120
got Realization, at least.

63
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,400
Now, I have to say that the quality of people is very important,

64
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,440
and in Maharashtra you must understand that there’s a quality.

65
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,280
These people have a special quality of purity, I think,

66
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,000
that invariably

67
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,480
I’ve seen the amount of working it takes place in Maharashtra,

68
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,840
doesn’t take place in other place.

69
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Perhaps the people are very much aware

70
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,800
of the three and a half peethas they have here.

71
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,520
Now for, they are Jains and have been following Jainism but

72
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,120
still they always worshipped the Goddess, the Devi.

73
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,560
So, we can understand that what is an impact

74
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,600
of those three and a half peethas is.

75
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,800
And you have visited

76
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,240
the great shrine of Chaturshringi.

77
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,720
Saptashringi.

78
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,440
I’m sorry, Saptashringi. [Hindi/Marathi]

79
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,400
Today being Ganesha’s day,

80
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,800
only it is going to come "chatura" in My mouth.

81
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,080
So this Saptashringi is the one

82
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,840
who has got seven chakras, means the limbic area,

83
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,000
and She is the Sahasrara, representing the Sahasrara.

84
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,840
That’s why she’s the Ardha-Matra.

85
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,160
And Her face and body and all that you can see,

86
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,920
is so beautifully made,

87
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,040
that it emits vibrations for miles together.

88
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,560
Those who are sensitive can feel it.

89
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,080
And you have been so lucky to go there and see that

90
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,160
miraculous place, that this have come out of Mother Earth.

91
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,400
And since ancient times it has been there.

92
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,120
Nobody knows when it appeared.

93
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,560
So we are in a very holy place,

94
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,600
because as you know Sita lived here for so many years

95
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,880
and Shri Rama was also with Her, and also Shri Lakshmana.

96
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,800
So it is obvious that this is a big kind of,

97
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,440
we can say a,

98
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,360
quite a big meeting place of various holy things,

99
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,440
that happened during the different periods of Maharashtra.

100
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,920
And the River Godavari also flows and the, also the

101
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,320
[Hindi/Marathi] source, source of this river is also very near.

102
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,360
Actually they wanted to take you down there,

103
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,520
but it’s another high climb and I thought you will be all exhausted

104
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,880
so I told her better not take that way.

105
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,120
But normally those people who come to Nasik always go there.

106
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,720
And there is one sad incident was that

107
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,200
there’s a Trimbakeshwar where is there is one of the Jyotirlingas.

108
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,680
There are twelve Jyotirlingas.

109
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,360
Actually we should say they are fourteen because

110
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,680
two of them are half, so .…

111
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,760
There are twelve Jyotirlingas,

112
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,200
and the complete are ten.

113
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Out of them, one of them is here.

114
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,920
But the gentleman was quite funny and he said that

115
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,840
"Those who are not Hindus, we cannot admit there".

116
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
So it’s again

117
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,720
all nonsense going on which will all stop one day, I’m sure,

118
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,440
because they have no sense how to recognize the saints, you see.

119
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,360
And once they start recognizing the saints, they will know that

120
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,080
they are the first who should go inside,

121
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,400
than those who are not realized.

122
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,560
Moreover, for Shiva doesn’t matter whether they are even bhoots,

123
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,680
doesn’t matter to Him. His temple need not be so guarded.

124
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,840
Any other temple I can understand, but Shiva’s I can’t understand

125
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,920
why there is so much guarding is needed.

126
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,560
But I think it’s a money-making proposition.

127
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,880
Whatever it is, it brings to My notice

128
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,920
all these nonsensical things that are going on in this country.

129
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,680
And then one starts realizing

130
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,640
that how much people have to open out themselves and give up fear

131
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,840
from people who are coming from other countries.

132
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,240
They suffer all of them, not only,

133
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,160
not only the people

134
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,920
who are religious but also people who are political, social.

135
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,640
They are all frightened of foreigners coming in now,

136
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,400
in the country, and they always start doubting.

137
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,240
And you can understand that’s why they doubt, but still

138
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,840
they should also understand that in these advanced stages

139
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,920
if there are saints, they should be able to recognize,

140
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,480
and this is what’s lacking in them.

141
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,280
And I was sad on that point, but doesn’t matter.

142
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,240
I think next time I’ll put him right, this gentleman.

143
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,280
So, on the whole, our whole stay was,

144
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,680
I think was very interesting and nice, and this evening

145
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,120
we are going to have a very beautiful musical program,

146
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,400
variety entertainment and classical music by children,

147
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,840
which you, I’m sure you’ll all enjoy very much.

148
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,800
That we’ll have here.

149
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,920
So on the whole we should be thankful to Mr. Sanghvi

150
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,640
and to Mr. Mehtani for organizing

151
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,280
this stay in Nasik so well

152
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,200
and with such comfort to all of us,

153
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,320
and such elevating experiences which has brought you

154
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,920
to something higher, and the experience of your own depth.

155
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,360
So may God bless you all.

156
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,120
[Hindi/Marathi]

157
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,400
[Hindi/Marathi]

158
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,920
They have to first ask for forgiveness of all of you,

159
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,360
and they are asking My forgiveness also.

160
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,040
[Hindi/Marathi]

161
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,920

[Hindi/Marathi]

165
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,400
They say, "If we have done any mistakes,

166
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,560
please forgive us,our whole family.”

167
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,560
[Hindi/Marathi]

168
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,880
[Hindi/Marathi]

169
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,280
First you have to worship yourself. Otherwise …

170
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,760
that’s why she has to worship herself,

171
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,440
that she should make herself, cleanse herself,

172
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,560
and she should worship herself, she should have respect for herself,

173
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,520
and she is worshipping Me.

174
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,360
If you are not a respectable person

175
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,920
you are not supposed to worship Me.

176
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,920
[Hindi/Marathi]

177
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,760

[Hindi/Marathi]

179
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,120

[Hindi/Marathi]

368
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:11,600
Now by doing karmas, our brains have muddled up.

369
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,160
So Goddess, we offer You this dhupa

370
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:20,800
so that You remove the enemy of karma in our head,

371
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,840
remove all of the karmas from our head

372
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,920
so that we are clarified, we give dhupa.

373
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,080
Now, see, it’s so interesting that

374
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,720
what they are suggesting is dhupam,

375
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,920
is the, dhupam is given to Shri Krishna,

376
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,360
who is the one who gives us the witness state.

377
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,000
So how it is connected. Deepam is the Spirit,

378
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,760
so you see how it is connected. The whole thing is so connected.

382
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:06,000
Now, it is so significant that a coconut is offered for moksha.

383
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,280
Now, you know, coconut has a limbic area inside it.

384
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,640
It has the three shells,

385
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,080
just like your brain has, and inside is the limbic area.

386
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,440
It represents the limbic area, and that’s why

387
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:23,120
for moksha you have to go into the limbic area and that’s why

388
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,560
a, is called as “shripala”, Holy Ghost, you see,

389
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,080
the pala of the Holy Ghost, you see,

390
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,280
the fruit that is liked, or representing Her.

391
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,040
This is your limbic area, and that’s why it is given to the Mother.

392
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,160
How significant, and how absolutely appropriate it is.

393
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,640
God has also created this, just to suggest that thing.

Now, this is a [Hindi/Marathi]

404

This is, she has to offer Me a supari,

which is the Ganesha Tattwa, and that is Agama Shastras,

means the shastras which have come out of that.

407

so this is the Shri Ganesha Tattwa which we offer You,

412
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,640
so that You also make us virtuous

413

Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, seven times with her.

433
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,560
Gavin, why have you dropped “Shri Mataji”?

434
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,920
You should put “Shri Mataji” essentially

435
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,360
because that’s the first name of the Sahasranama, all right?

436
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:44,640
Should be there, “Shri Mataji”.

437
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:49,240
When you are standardizing the thing - who has done this?

438
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,400
– you must ask Me;

439
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,880
Because that’s the biggest part, is that I am the Mother, isn’t it?

[Hindi/Marathi]

441
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,720
And that is actually the name given by the modern people,

442
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:08,160
so it must be accepted. Is an additional thing.

443
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:16,400
When you are standardizing the things, you must ask Me, all of you.

444
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:21,040
I don’t know who has done it, but whosoever it is.

I wish you could all remember by heart,

500
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,360
so that it’s a very nice way of getting rid

501
01:16:54,560 --> 01:17:01,840
of our six types of enemies.

502
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,680
You also don’t know what to ask God.

503
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,800
You are always asking for something which is not important.

504
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:23,200
Our priorities are all wrong.

505
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,880

Mr. Sanghvi said that he would not accept any money

from the people for Puja. I said, “But they must all join in”.

511
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:14,840
So with great difficulty they agreed that we should collect

512
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:20,680
eleven rupees from all of you for the Puja,

513
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:24,120

514
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,440
Twenty one.

515
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:29,680
