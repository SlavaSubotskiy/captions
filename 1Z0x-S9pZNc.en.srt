1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,515
India, Bordi, 09/02/1985

2
01:35:47,459 --> 01:35:54,450
On this occasion when you are all leaving
me, is rather hard to listen to these qualities

3
01:35:54,450 --> 01:35:58,680
described in your beautiful song.

4
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:23,690
My words are so loaded with a feeling of extreme
sadness, plus the exuberance of new ventures,

5
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:38,180
some ideas that I have to do much more to
establish whatever you are describing me.

6
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:43,890
So many rakshasa are to be killed as you have
described Me.

7
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:48,021
All the disparities are to be removed from
this world.

8
01:36:48,021 --> 01:36:55,460
All the ignorance, the darkness, the chimera
has to be removed, as you have described me.

9
01:36:55,460 --> 01:37:09,171
It is very easy to destroy this world and
it was easier to destroy the demons and the

10
01:37:09,171 --> 01:37:21,100
devils, but today the time is so precarious
that all these have entered into the brains,

11
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:25,159
the Sahastrara of many seekers.

12
01:37:25,159 --> 01:37:38,719
So, it’s a very delicate task to remove
those horrible influences to save the seekers

13
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:44,030
from the clutches of these devils.

14
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:55,800
You have been very kind to understand that
it is a very delicate thing and we cannot

15
01:37:55,800 --> 01:38:00,570
do it with harshness, with bluntness, with
straightforward statements.

16
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:11,940
We have to take them round because there are
hard rocks and make them understand through

17
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:18,440
compassion, love and complete concern.

18
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:24,830
Discretion is the only way we can manage and
one has to use all kinds of methods of discretion

19
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:29,040
to save these people.

20
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:34,340
Once a maximum number is saved, the rakshasas
can be destroyed.

21
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:42,170
As it is they are so much exposed now, they
are getting destroyed by themselves, by their

22
01:38:42,170 --> 01:38:43,170
own behavior.

23
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:48,140
That’s the best about the falsehood, that
it shows itself.

24
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:53,110
The effects are shown.

25
01:38:53,110 --> 01:39:04,010
In the process we also find that the effects
of these devils are still in our behavior

26
01:39:04,010 --> 01:39:05,550
sometimes lingering.

27
01:39:05,550 --> 01:39:10,870
So all the Sahaja Yogis who have been to other
false gurus should be careful so that they

28
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:15,450
should not be any more dominated when they
are ascending.

29
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:24,300
Also there are other effects of our past,
our aggressiveness, our incompatibility, our

30
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:26,360
anti-collective activities.

31
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:30,090
All this comes from the grossness of personality.

32
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:35,950
As soon as your grossness becomes subtler
and subtler you’ll merge, dissolve into

33
01:39:35,950 --> 01:39:38,480
the collective understanding, very easily.

34
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:52,100
Now, the
things that I have to do sometimes looks like

35
01:39:52,100 --> 01:40:02,050
mountainous and I seek your help in every
way.

36
01:40:02,050 --> 01:40:10,900
I cannot do it alone, so I seek your help
and I ask for your guidance in many ways,

37
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:14,780
because human beings are not easy to understand.

38
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:19,010
You have to ask human beings what they are
up to.

39
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:25,780
Now, the first task is ahead of you is to
save yourself from negativity from within,

40
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:27,170
from within.

41
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:32,270
You might find one or two murmuring souls
here and there talking nonsense about the

42
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:37,480
program we had, the tour we had, the way we
went round, about nonsensical thing, which

43
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,950
has no meaning to the spiritual life.

44
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:44,890
Or maybe some people who would be grudging
about something else, whose attentions have

45
01:40:44,890 --> 01:40:46,600
been on some other things.

46
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:50,210
So forget about them, because you should worry
about your ascent.

47
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:56,090
The negativity can also come from your own
understanding of things.

48
01:40:56,090 --> 01:41:05,930
My only effort was to see that you forget
the rest of the world and start ascending

49
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:09,770
in collectivity, as well as in your own spiritual
growth.

50
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:14,920
These are so simultaneous that I cannot differentiate
between the two.

51
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:17,590
Like the sun when it rises the sunshine comes.

52
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:19,240
It’s like that.

53
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:24,040
So, one has to be very careful about this
point, that when you go from here, anybody

54
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:33,230
who starts talking in the anti way, just put
your hands on your ears and say that, “This

55
01:41:33,230 --> 01:41:34,230
is not…

56
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:35,230
We don’t want to hear.

57
01:41:35,230 --> 01:41:36,780
Please don’t make us pull down”.

58
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:43,200
Because they’ll pull you down and some who
are half-baked Sahaja Yogis will fall down.

59
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:48,110
I hope all those who have come will stick
to what they have achieved, what they have

60
01:41:48,110 --> 01:41:52,580
felt, what they have understood and go further
with it.

61
01:41:52,580 --> 01:42:01,400
The wholesomeness, the wholesomeness of the
experience is to be envisaged, to be felt

62
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:04,540
when you are gone from here.

63
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:10,660
Just to think of it, the memory of that, the
Mahakali Shakti of that will give you all

64
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:17,641
the beautiful experiences, the shiver, which
we call the shiver of the experiences and

65
01:42:17,641 --> 01:42:25,010
you will enjoy the thrills that you had in
India, again back when you are in that country.

66
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:28,130
And those thrills will fill the atmosphere.

67
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:29,980
The atmosphere changes tremendously.

68
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:37,350
When the Sahaja Yogis increase in sizes, the
atmosphere changes and the climate changes.

69
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:39,920
Not only that, but human beings also start
changing.

70
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:44,580
So it is necessary for us to have more and
more people coming to India.

71
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:47,410
So now, first your own negativity is to be
seen.

72
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:50,990
Then, you must see among Sahaja Yogis, we
are one.

73
01:42:50,990 --> 01:42:53,080
Never criticize another Sahaja Yogi.

74
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:55,700
Never talk to other Sahaja Yogi harshly.

75
01:42:55,700 --> 01:43:00,160
We are very kind to other people, because
we know that if we talk like this to another

76
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:04,330
person that person will not accept it and
he will react.

77
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:10,180
But with Sahaja Yoga many people try, I have
seen, to talk to each other in a very rough

78
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:15,450
manner and sometimes in the organization also
they try to aggress.

79
01:43:15,450 --> 01:43:20,430
Like some arrangement is there so they’ll
say, “Why not this?”

80
01:43:20,430 --> 01:43:25,010
Try to give up most of the things that you
want to say.

81
01:43:25,010 --> 01:43:27,220
Is very simple, like that.

82
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:30,510
That, now supposing say to have this color.

83
01:43:30,510 --> 01:43:33,760
Just keep quiet, see what happens.

84
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,100
Because you think you can give a suggestion
you just give a suggestion, because you must

85
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:38,200
say something.

86
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:39,770
Not necessary.

87
01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:40,770
Not necessary.

88
01:43:40,770 --> 01:43:43,550
Because you have seen in Japan, only one person
speaks.

89
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:49,350
You see, if there is necessary to say something,
then you should say.

90
01:43:49,350 --> 01:43:54,360
Otherwise, unnecessarily, just to create a
new idea, a new theme, a new stuff, is not

91
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,040
proper.

92
01:43:56,040 --> 01:44:05,590
Now, the main thing about Sahaja Yoga is this,
that it does not belong to any country.

93
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:09,570
It belongs to the country that is God’s
kingdom.

94
01:44:09,570 --> 01:44:13,560
So it’s a very different thing into which
you have landed.

95
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:18,890
Once you realize this, once you accept this
situation that you have now entered into the

96
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:26,040
kingdom of God, your sense of security will
be built up, your style will be built up,

97
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:30,810
your behavior will improve, your attitude
towards yourself will improve and you will

98
01:44:30,810 --> 01:44:36,890
really feel you have jumped into the sea,
the ocean of joy.

99
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:38,040
Just assume the power.

100
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:40,670
Assumption is very difficult in Sahaja Yoga.

101
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:44,480
Reality people assume with difficulties.

102
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:47,220
If it is unreal, if somebody can mesmerize,
you believe it.

103
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:52,940
So just believe that you are in the heaven
now.

104
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:57,700
This is the kingdom of God and this is where
you have to be and enjoy that.

105
01:44:57,700 --> 01:44:59,070
You will be amazed.

106
01:44:59,070 --> 01:45:05,310
Once it happens, all your seeking will end,
all your frustrations will end and now you

107
01:45:05,310 --> 01:45:09,500
will know that you have reached that situation
where now you have to give.

108
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,700
Now you have become the light and light has
to give.

109
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:15,810
That’s the job of the light and you will
not be any more bothered about how to keep

110
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:22,800
light going, because once you start giving
it that way it freely moves.

111
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:26,680
The collectivity cannot come with mediocre
efforts.

112
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:31,370
Like many people think that if you invite
people for tea or something like that then

113
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:32,990
the some more people will come.

114
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:39,040
Such people never stay or those people who
like very sweet words to be said to them and

115
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:45,660
all that, they just come for a picnic sort
of a thing, have a very sweet sitting down,

116
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:48,470
some sort of a group, and then they disappear.

117
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:51,850
So, we have to have people who are of quality.

118
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:57,140
To begin with we have to have people of quality,
to end with also we have to have people with

119
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:58,140
quality.

120
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:01,750
The people who are peripheral are headaches
for Sahaja Yoga.

121
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:03,950
They come, trouble us from the sides.

122
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:09,840
Like you see these skirmishes we have from
the outside, that’s how they come and just

123
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:12,640
hit some people on the outside and [unclear:
sounds like won’t go out].

124
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:16,840
So the people who are on the periphery are
of no use to us.

125
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:21,760
So try to have people of quality as far as
possible, as many as can.

126
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:23,910
The popularity is not the point in Sahaja
Yoga.

127
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:27,600
Is the quality, what you achieve and where
you reach.

128
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:30,650
If the quality of the people is poor, just
give them up.

129
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:35,060
Forget it, don’t argue with them, don’t
try to persuade them, don’t try to bring

130
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:36,060
them.

131
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:38,530
This is one of the understandings we should
have.

132
01:46:38,530 --> 01:46:41,350
We should not go on fighting for the whole
world.

133
01:46:41,350 --> 01:46:46,070
Where is the place in God’s heaven to fit
all these nonsensical people?

134
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:47,860
There’s no room there.

135
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:49,200
There’s no room.

136
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:52,160
So better have it, because they don’t deserve
it.

137
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:55,570
So don’t try to push such people into it.

138
01:46:55,570 --> 01:46:58,290
We are trying some experiments with some people
who are very difficult and useless.

139
01:46:58,290 --> 01:47:01,390
We are trying to push them here and there.

140
01:47:01,390 --> 01:47:04,140
If they do not work out, we’ll have to throw
them out.

141
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:05,140
And you must accept it.

142
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:09,450
There should be no compassion for such people,
but compassion for other Sahaja Yogis who

143
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:10,810
are suffering from them.

144
01:47:10,810 --> 01:47:14,730
That’s the best way to have compassion is
to understand these are saints and they are

145
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:20,390
suffering because of the negative people,
so why push them into Sahaja Yoga and trouble

146
01:47:20,390 --> 01:47:21,390
everyone.

147
01:47:21,390 --> 01:47:23,260
That’s not the way it should be.

148
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:27,850
Now, so this is one of the things one should
understand when you are organizing, that have

149
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:29,470
people of quality.

150
01:47:29,470 --> 01:47:33,240
If you have ten people of quality will create
ten thousand tomorrow.

151
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:37,990
But, if you have even one hopeless fellow,
it will kill even the rest of the nine.

152
01:47:37,990 --> 01:47:44,920
So be careful that you don’t allow people
who are not of quality to come to puja.

153
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:46,990
Outsiders should not come to puja.

154
01:47:46,990 --> 01:47:52,240
Only the people who are of quality should
come, and those who have been now traveling,

155
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:58,160
we have been noting how they have been behaving,
how their behavior has been, how they have

156
01:47:58,160 --> 01:47:59,160
been progressing.

157
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:01,720
We know all about every one of them.

158
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:06,760
So, we’ll see them, how they are progressing
further when I visit your countries and I’ll

159
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:07,760
see for it.

160
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:14,020
And then, I’ll be able to tell you that
such and such person has not progressed at

161
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:15,020
all.

162
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:21,419
So, this should be the attitude that we all
should individually progress and once we progress

163
01:48:21,419 --> 01:48:23,830
individually it shows in collective enjoyment.

164
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:29,890
A person who cannot enjoy collectivity is
not a Sahaja Yogi.

165
01:48:29,890 --> 01:48:33,750
Now Leader can be only one; there cannot be
three leaders.

166
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:42,190
Now for all purposes I have appointed Danny
as the Leader of United Nations, United … ah,

167
01:48:42,190 --> 01:48:48,730
that’s the word … that’s the word … that’s
the word…ah, we should say United States,

168
01:48:48,730 --> 01:48:55,570
but then we have to have United Nations later
on.

169
01:48:55,570 --> 01:49:06,970
Because I find in Danny those qualities which
are required for a good Sahaja Yogi.

170
01:49:06,970 --> 01:49:09,090
He’s very congenial.

171
01:49:09,090 --> 01:49:11,090
He knows how to go round people.

172
01:49:11,090 --> 01:49:18,820
He is very steadfast in his own ascent and
he is a person who doesn’t shout at people,

173
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:24,930
who doesn’t get angry with people too much,
and I haven’t seen him getting angry with

174
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:26,099
anyone whatsoever, so far.

175
01:49:26,099 --> 01:49:28,300
I have been with him for so many days.

176
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:32,270
And, he manages people very well and he knows
how to control them.

177
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:35,740
But, he is extremely strong as far as Sahaja
Yoga is concerned.

178
01:49:35,740 --> 01:49:37,750
Extremely strong and he understands it.

179
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:44,670
So, all these qualities can help you people
very much to understand how a leader should

180
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:45,670
be.

181
01:49:45,670 --> 01:49:46,670
Moreover, he is selfless.

182
01:49:46,670 --> 01:49:49,830
He has no selfish aims for anything whatsoever,
for his name, for his position, for anything

183
01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:50,830
I have seen.

184
01:49:50,830 --> 01:49:53,260
He doesn’t mind anybody becoming a leader,
he doesn’t mind anything whatsoever.

185
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:57,910
That sort of a thing should be that anybody
becomes a leader is just a joke.

186
01:49:57,910 --> 01:50:01,260
Otherwise, I have seen people, you make them
the trustees they just ride on the horse.

187
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:03,890
You make them something, leader, they ride
on the horse.

188
01:50:03,890 --> 01:50:05,080
All sorts of things happen.

189
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:11,290
That should not happen any more, and the leaders
must see to the point that they have to become

190
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:13,359
really great evolved avadhutas.

191
01:50:13,359 --> 01:50:15,950
Otherwise they cannot impress people.

192
01:50:15,950 --> 01:50:22,630
Avadhutas are the people who are extremely
compassionate, extremely kind and for you

193
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:28,320
I would say you should follow the example,
Tukarama, because he was such a kind and a

194
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:35,760
sweet person, but he said things which were
very, very deep and very straightforward.

195
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:41,780
So the forthright behavior need not be so
sharp as to cut everybody through.

196
01:50:41,780 --> 01:50:47,140
Forthright could be such that it guides the
person in the proper way and the plying of

197
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:50,940
a person in this ocean of maya becomes easier.

198
01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:53,159
That is what is called the leadership.

199
01:50:53,159 --> 01:50:55,880
Now leadership should not be challenged.

200
01:50:55,880 --> 01:51:00,060
Some people have too much ideas from outside,
because they think they are something, you

201
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:01,230
see, they know.

202
01:51:01,230 --> 01:51:07,150
They are administrators or they are journalists
or they have worked as some sort of a politicians

203
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:11,520
or this and that, and they try to control
the leaders, is a wrong thing.

204
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:15,020
So now do not try to control the leaders.

205
01:51:15,020 --> 01:51:17,100
If there’s something wrong I’ll correct
them.

206
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:22,650
This is very important, because again and
again I tell you that once you start challenging

207
01:51:22,650 --> 01:51:25,310
the leader I get the pangs of it.

208
01:51:25,310 --> 01:51:26,359
So, please do not do it.

209
01:51:26,359 --> 01:51:30,960
If you do not want to hurt me, do not challenge
the leader as he is.

210
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:39,340
Now, as you are going away, you are taking
all the sweet memories from here of the Indians.

211
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:50,310
You have to take their last, I should say,
the glimpse and also give them a promise that

212
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:56,070
you will write to them, thanking them, keep
contact, have friends, write letters to them,

213
01:51:56,070 --> 01:51:57,669
they will write to you.

214
01:51:57,669 --> 01:52:03,969
Let us have contacts and know what’s happening,
where what is happening and thus we can have

215
01:52:03,969 --> 01:52:11,500
a nice circulation and communication with
each other and we can establish a better understanding

216
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:15,180
of different countries through this method.

217
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:22,400
Also, those who have come from other countries,
like say Australians have come, should write

218
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:26,979
to English or they can write to French or
the French could write to Australians.

219
01:52:26,979 --> 01:52:30,250
Like that there should be a big movement.

220
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:31,719
The circulation has to be good.

221
01:52:31,719 --> 01:52:36,979
If the circulation is not good the body gets
sick, so the circulation has to be good and

222
01:52:36,979 --> 01:52:45,130
all of you have to do that circulation in
a way that is good, compassionate and in a

223
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:46,599
Sahaj manner.

224
01:52:46,599 --> 01:52:52,269
My own work does not finish.

225
01:52:52,269 --> 01:52:56,470
I am moving on now, as you know, to another
areas.

226
01:52:56,470 --> 01:52:59,310
Then I’ll be going to Calcutta.

227
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:02,509
For the first time we’ll be having program
in Calcutta in this way.

228
01:53:02,509 --> 01:53:10,390
And then I am going to Australia and again
back, New Zealand and back to India and then

229
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:12,990
again back to London and I go on moving.

230
01:53:12,990 --> 01:53:17,830
You see mine is such a circuitous, complicated
roundabout ways.

231
01:53:17,830 --> 01:53:19,860
The sun has to do only one way.

232
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:23,400
I’m going this way, that way.

233
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:28,120
All sorts of movements are there, nothing
regular.

234
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:31,070
Absolutely it is regularly irregular.

235
01:53:31,070 --> 01:53:36,540
It is like that, and, it’s, still it’s
working out.

236
01:53:36,540 --> 01:53:40,870
It works out with some sort of a rhythm in
it, I think.

237
01:53:40,870 --> 01:53:46,110
It pulsates and I feel quite happy with that
rhythmic movement.

238
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:55,030
So, I have to pray that you look after your
health, look after your spiritual wealth and

239
01:53:55,030 --> 01:54:00,280
look after your Sahaja Yoga family in your
own countries.

240
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:03,370
So may God bless you all.

241
01:54:03,370 --> 01:54:11,490
Section in Marathi language

242
01:54:11,490 --> 01:54:20,080
I’m thanking them for looking after you
very much.

243
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:34,600
They have, I mean, gone all the way out in
the villages and in very far-fetched places,

244
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:42,320
and whatever I ask them for they arrange the
programs in the actual jungles and along the

245
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:48,800
riversides, and all kinds of things they have
done, just to make you feel happy and away

246
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:50,920
from the madding crowd.

247
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:58,629
All this has worked out, only because of their
cooperation, without any reward, without anything.

248
01:54:58,629 --> 01:55:02,950
They have to take leave, giving up their jobs
and coming down.

249
01:55:02,950 --> 01:55:08,160
Everything they have done so well that we
can see that how in a place like Brahmapuri

250
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:13,150
which is such a far-fetched place, or in a
place like Sangli where we had no rooms or

251
01:55:13,150 --> 01:55:17,840
anything, they arranged all these tents, and
all that overnight for you people to stay

252
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:19,810
and to enjoy your stay there.

253
01:55:19,810 --> 01:55:26,460
So, if there was some sort of a problem you
must understand that we don’t have tents

254
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:28,190
easily available in India.

255
01:55:28,190 --> 01:55:29,210
We have to make them.

256
01:55:29,210 --> 01:55:34,050
We haven’t got all these facilities as you
have for camping, because you are so fond

257
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:37,889
of camping there that if you go to a shop
you can get everything for camping.

258
01:55:37,889 --> 01:55:39,550
Here, you have to make everything.

259
01:55:39,550 --> 01:55:44,220
You just cannot get things for camping because
somehow Indians have no time for camping at

260
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:51,310
all and they have no part time for partaking
a holiday, and neither they go for a holiday,

261
01:55:51,310 --> 01:55:52,850
and I was the other day surprised.

262
01:55:52,850 --> 01:55:57,690
Somebody told me that he took a taxi and went
to south of India for a trip.

263
01:55:57,690 --> 01:55:58,800
I was really surprised.

264
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:03,940
How could he do it, because normally this
is seldom done, and is a good idea to go down

265
01:56:03,940 --> 01:56:07,960
like that, meet other Sahaja Yogis and have
a little travel.

266
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:09,410
But they just don’t move.

267
01:56:09,410 --> 01:56:10,410
They’re like Ganeshas.

268
01:56:10,410 --> 01:56:14,790
Once set in one place they have set till they
are put in the sea.

269
01:56:14,790 --> 01:56:23,050
So, it was very remarkable how so many people
have come from Delhi, all the way, and I thank

270
01:56:23,050 --> 01:56:29,889
them for coming down and making this occasion
so auspicious and so good.

271
01:56:29,889 --> 01:56:39,470
[unclear: may be Especially or Specially],
I have to thank Madras Sahaja Yogis who have

272
01:56:39,470 --> 01:56:51,470
come all the way from Madras, it’s so far
away, to come here and to join us.

273
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:58,840
Of course, the Maharashtra Sahaja Yogis are
to be thanked again and again for looking

274
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:05,380
after us so well.

275
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:13,100
I hope one day we’ll be able to invite them
to your different countries and can have some

276
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:14,870
seminars like this.

277
01:57:14,870 --> 01:57:15,870
One day, might be.

278
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:19,070
Such a day might come such a time when we
will be able to do it, when we’ll have our

279
01:57:19,070 --> 01:57:26,160
own ship and people can travel on the ship.

280
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:32,360
And, I have such ideas.

281
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:34,020
You see, I’m too enthusiastic.

282
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:36,120
I have tremendous ideas.

283
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:40,420
If I tell you, you’ll be all jumping in
the air, so I don’t want to tell you about

284
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:41,420
that.

285
01:57:41,420 --> 01:57:42,950
But it materializes.

286
01:57:42,950 --> 01:57:50,070
Somehow or other, my ideas materialize, and
we should have such a seminar that we can

287
01:57:50,070 --> 01:57:55,869
celebrate it on a ship, where the ship moves
throughout the world, and we meet every corner

288
01:57:55,869 --> 01:57:57,139
and the shores of the world.

289
01:57:57,139 --> 01:57:58,720
That would be a nice idea.

290
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:01,480
For a month, if you travel, you can do it,
the whole world, I think.

291
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:11,960
It’s not so difficult if you have a good,
nice ship, given us to us by IMO.

292
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:19,110
So, this is hoping for the best.

293
01:58:19,110 --> 01:58:23,070
Now as it is, people are very helpful in this
country.

294
01:58:23,070 --> 01:58:24,580
The government is very helpful.

295
01:58:24,580 --> 01:58:27,180
We have seen the central government was very
helpful.

296
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:28,590
The Customs were very helpful.

297
01:58:28,590 --> 01:58:33,800
All this has happened because one person gets
realization in the Customs, she talks to another

298
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:35,760
person, he gets all the Custom people to [unclear].

299
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:37,960
[unclear: may be One other or Another] person,
a policeman, talks to another policeman, all

300
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:40,160
the policemen are there.

301
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:44,690
But you see, the rapport in this country is
much more than it is otherwise because the

302
01:58:44,690 --> 01:58:49,190
climate of this country is such that we are
open, our houses are open, we have a open

303
01:58:49,190 --> 01:58:50,190
home.

304
01:58:50,190 --> 01:58:51,900
We live in an open way.

305
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:55,070
In a village everybody knows everyone.

306
01:58:55,070 --> 01:58:57,980
Say, in a city, now, in [unclear: sounds like
Nepal] if you tell my father’s name everybody

307
01:58:57,980 --> 01:58:58,980
knows him.

308
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:04,250
I mean, everybody knows me, everybody knows
my father, and I know them, so it’s like

309
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:08,560
a big rapport, and that’s an advantage we
have which we can create there with the sunshine

310
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:09,820
of our love.

311
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:15,550
So, even those who are not Sahaja Yogis, try
to be kind to them, try to be nice to them.

312
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:20,020
Don’t show that you are fanatics or anything,
but try to be sweet and nice.

313
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:21,020
Try.

314
01:59:21,020 --> 01:59:23,930
If they can come, well and good, but do not
insist, do not force them.

315
01:59:23,930 --> 01:59:24,930
That’s the worst thing.

316
01:59:24,930 --> 01:59:29,570
Never force such people to come in because
such people, if they come, they are very great

317
01:59:29,570 --> 01:59:30,570
troublesome people.

318
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:34,670
They are of no gain to us, so just do not
force anybody to come.

319
01:59:34,670 --> 01:59:39,290
There are your relations, brothers, sisters,
husband, wife, just forget them.

320
01:59:39,290 --> 01:59:41,450
If they want to come, let them come.

321
01:59:41,450 --> 01:59:42,889
Otherwise, just forget them.

322
01:59:42,889 --> 01:59:45,690
Don’t bother your heads about them.

323
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:51,180
Now, regarding next tour, I don’t know how
we could manage it next year but I’ll let

324
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:56,200
you know about it in time so that we can arrange
it in a better way than this time.

325
01:59:56,200 --> 02:00:00,970
Maybe we might have again two tours, I don’t
know, or maybe fifteen days’ tours, or something

326
02:00:00,970 --> 02:00:08,680
like that, so that we do two sides of tour
in fifteen days, something like that.

327
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:14,420
So, we’ll try to evolve new ideas as you
have seen that realization giving is becoming

328
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:22,230
simpler and simpler, and maybe that just attending
the program, people might get realized.

329
02:00:22,230 --> 02:00:30,610
It may happen like that, one day in India.

330
02:00:30,610 --> 02:00:36,840
I would like to have sensible, proper, constructive
ideas from you for your country.

331
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:41,410
That’s a very good idea, but do not condemn
somebody else and say that that fellow’s

332
02:00:41,410 --> 02:00:42,430
like this and that.

333
02:00:42,430 --> 02:00:44,660
That I don’t like at all because I know
who is who.

334
02:00:44,660 --> 02:00:50,190
So, just tell me if you have any constructive
ideas about this, about propagating, going

335
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:51,950
to some new countries.

336
02:00:51,950 --> 02:00:56,660
Like, Gregoire wanted to start something in
Greece, and there are some people who want

337
02:00:56,660 --> 02:00:58,129
to do it in Greece also.

338
02:00:58,129 --> 02:01:02,521
So, we have to see how we can work it out
in Greece and we have to find out people who

339
02:01:02,521 --> 02:01:06,430
will work it out in other places, wherever
you think you can do it.

340
02:01:06,430 --> 02:01:11,420
Like Tunisia, some people said it would be
a good idea to enter into.

341
02:01:11,420 --> 02:01:18,230
But you just work it out and let me know whatever
countries you think we can do this.

342
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:21,530
Maybe Brazil, maybe another place, one could
go.

343
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:27,610
But now I think, before I go there, some of
you should go, work it out, establish a centre,

344
02:01:27,610 --> 02:01:30,290
have a proper centre running, and then I should
go.

345
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:31,290
Is better.

346
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:32,350
Otherwise it is quite wasted.

347
02:01:32,350 --> 02:01:36,510
That’s how we are going to propagate in
the west.

348
02:01:36,510 --> 02:01:39,910
In the same way in India, also we have to
do the same.

349
02:01:39,910 --> 02:01:46,259
I used to propagate it in such a manner that
we ourselves travel a lot.

350
02:01:46,259 --> 02:01:51,610
Say we are living in a place like Delhi, we
can go along, meet people of different organizations,

351
02:01:51,610 --> 02:01:54,940
talk to them and organize that we’ll come
and talk.

352
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:57,040
It’s not necessary for me to go there.

353
02:01:57,040 --> 02:02:04,020
You can all talk and give lectures, in different
organizations, in different institutions and

354
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:05,560
in different municipalities and all that.

355
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:09,800
In India it is much easier to organize these
lectures.

356
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:12,360
Indians are very fond of listening to lectures.

357
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:14,040
So that would be a good idea.

358
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:19,250
But for westerners also, like in universities
you can handle professors and talk to them.

359
02:02:19,250 --> 02:02:22,950
On your own you can think of so many things
that you can do.

360
02:02:22,950 --> 02:02:27,270
And, I’m sure one day will come that all
these efforts will work out.

361
02:02:27,270 --> 02:02:29,940
As I told you about Buddha’s disciples used
to do.

362
02:02:29,940 --> 02:02:33,290
And, I need not go to all these various places.

363
02:02:33,290 --> 02:02:38,190
You can manage it and seeing you only, people
will get to Sahaja Yoga much faster, because

364
02:02:38,190 --> 02:02:43,210
they’ll think, the one who has given them
this, if they are so great, then that the

365
02:02:43,210 --> 02:02:46,970
person who has given must be greater and I
need not see them, because sometimes they

366
02:02:46,970 --> 02:02:51,100
get disappointed to see me also.

367
02:02:51,100 --> 02:02:58,950
They think that a person who was talking to
us was very brilliant and this and that, andin

368
02:02:58,950 --> 02:03:11,100
my own swabhava of Mahamaya I
try to fumble and sometimes make mistakes

369
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:20,590
and try to become a simple housewife, and
then people don’t understand that this little

370
02:03:20,590 --> 02:03:27,080
housewife, a government servant’s wife,
you see, that’s another gone case, and then

371
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:33,150
an Indian Christian and all that thing, then
she’s must be hopeless.

372
02:03:33,150 --> 02:03:41,550
So all these things, you see, make up for
the mind and that’s how the, one can go

373
02:03:41,550 --> 02:03:46,200
into the final decision of the last judgment.

374
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:49,230
You see, Mahamaya is the only way one can
judge people.

375
02:03:49,230 --> 02:03:50,650
There’s no other way out.

376
02:03:50,650 --> 02:03:57,900
Those who can see through the Maya, only such
people will be redeemed.

377
02:03:57,900 --> 02:04:03,620
Those who cannot see through the Maya cannot
be redeemed.

378
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:13,260
So Maya is important.

379
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:34,129
Now the last, but not the least, remember
that your Mother loves you very much.

380
02:04:34,129 --> 02:04:38,810
Thank you very much.
