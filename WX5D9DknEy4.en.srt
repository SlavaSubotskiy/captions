1
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:22,709
I must have said lots of things about Christ before,

2
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:28,042
and how Jesus Christ is related to Shri Radhaji,

3
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:37,709
that He is the incarnation of Sri Ganesha who was the son of the Adi Shakti

4
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:41,668
to begin with but then he was given to Shri Radhaji

5
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:48,209
and Shri Radha created as Mahalaxmi, as Mother Mary

6
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:51,459
this great incarnation of Christ.

7
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:56,751
Now for the western mind it is impossible to understand

8
00:04:56,793 --> 00:05:01,376
how there can be a immaculate conception because they have no sense at all,

9
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:05,042
no sensitivity at all to spiritual life.

10
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,834
We Indians can understand it,

11
00:05:06,876 --> 00:05:09,918
is very easy for Indians to understand

12
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:13,834
because we had Sri Ganesha created that way.

13
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:16,292
We just believe it we don't doubt these things.

14
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:18,626
Whatever is said about God is not to be doubted

15
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:21,958
with this limited brain, that's not done in India.

16
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,918
But in the west, from the very birth of Christ

17
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:31,542
they have had arguments, arguments, arguments, arguments

18
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:37,209
with this limited brain they had, and the whole religion in the name of Christ

19
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:43,209
is just a perversion, such a horrible things have been said

20
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:52,167
that it's unbelievable. His purity, his holiness, his auspiciousness

21
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:55,376
is never understood in the west I think.

22
00:05:55,417 --> 00:06:02,376
Those who follow Christianity, how can they be so debased

23
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:07,042
in their moral character. They're all right for their political,

24
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:13,626
their economical you can say, their legal side but their moral sense

25
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:16,459
is absolutely missing. Is very surprising,

26
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,334
those who are the followers of Christ

27
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:23,167
should have the greatest amount of morality.

28
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:31,125
He has said that thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,

29
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:36,376
such a subtle thing, even the eye should not have adultery,

30
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:44,501
should not have lust and greed. Such a subtle thing he has said it,

31
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:50,292
and just think in the west people could not follow it

32
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:52,958
because the whole religion got perverted

33
00:06:52,958 --> 00:07:00,751
under the influence of Paul and Peter. It's a very serious thing

34
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:03,918
they have done against Christ, it's still going on.

35
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,084
Still this Catholic church, though being exposed so much,

36
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,751
is still going on, in India also all over,

37
00:07:10,793 --> 00:07:15,042
is stupid this Protestant church also is going on everywhere.

38
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:19,751
What good name have they brought to Christ? One should see.

39
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:24,084
The first and foremost thing he has said

40
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:31,376
that you must enter into the Kingdom of God,

41
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,626
that you must be born again.

42
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:37,292
So it's all mental, you are born again,

43
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:40,793
you have a certificate, you are born again, finished.

44
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:46,958
So this mental attitude of the west is responsible

45
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,417
for killing the great incarnation of Christ,

46
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,834
I think is another crucifixion.

47
00:07:57,876 --> 00:08:02,542
Mentally you cannot understand spirituality.

48
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:05,918
So they were telling your brain trust, brain trust,

49
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,751
I said brain trusting-I can't understand in Sahaja Yoga.

50
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:20,584
In Sahaja Yoga what is the brain trust? Where is the brain?

51
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:27,417
In thoughtless awareness where is the brain?

52
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:32,209
So this brain trust business might be all right

53
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:35,250
for any other place but for Sahaja Yoga, I still don't understand

54
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,709
what do you do in brain trust. Because some people

55
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:41,042
want to come on the stage and speak you see,

56
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:50,334
they have a kind of a madness, they can't get over it.

57
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:53,292
So they might be coming to the brain trust maybe,

58
00:08:53,292 --> 00:09:02,542
but it's not brain, it's the heart, is the heart

59
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:08,876
which has to be opened out because with the brain

60
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:13,084
what we do is all kinds of materialism.

61
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:18,876
All kinds of nonsense has come from human brain only,

62
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:23,668
not so much from animals brain. You can see

63
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:29,501
if you go to any forest it's clean, nice smelling,

64
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:33,125
so well but put one human being there and you will know

65
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:38,250
that this filth, dirt has come from some human being.

66
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:47,084
So as it is they have made a mess of all the great incarnations

67
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:53,376
but worst is done to Christ and I feel what a waste it was.

68
00:09:53,417 --> 00:10:03,626
So we must understand Christ in the right sense, he is the eternal child,

69
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:09,209
he is the innocence itself, he's the source of innocence

70
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:14,292
and he is the bestower of all blessings in all chakras.

71
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:18,751
But that doesn't mean that you are Christians,

72
00:10:18,793 --> 00:10:23,334
you should be very proud that oh she's talking about Christ,

73
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:27,709
many I've seen Sahaja Yogis are still identified with Christ

74
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,958
while they have nothing to do with Christ at all.

75
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:43,417
Now one has to understand that how Christ in his miraculous life

76
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:47,876
has shown so many miracles. First of all his birth was immaculate.

77
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:52,542
So now they are discussing the birth of Mary

78
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:55,793
whether it's immaculate or not. For all incarnations

79
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:59,709
every kind of birth is immaculate, they are beyond sins,

80
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:02,250
they are special people. They may come as human beings,

81
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,042
they may come as angels, they may come as anything,

82
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:08,918
they are divine and we should understand

83
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,793
that this little brain of ours cannot discuss about them

84
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:19,292
and talk about them but is to just surrender and worship them.

85
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:26,668
They are much beyond us. So for the western mind

86
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:31,334
it is important to understand that the life of Christ

87
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:36,250
was such a blessing for them that they have lost it,

88
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,250
they have wasted it and they have never understood how to respect it.

89
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:50,793
The whole thing became like a political, economical, nonsensical fraud.

90
00:11:50,834 --> 00:12:00,918
I have told you long time back that how we can prove

91
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:05,459
that Christ was Ganesha and he was the logos,

92
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:10,209
he was the what we call is the Brahmanat, the first sound.

93
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:17,668
By looking at your left side from the right side,

94
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:23,209
if you see the Mooladhara you will see swastikas

95
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,209
because it is made of carbon atom.

96
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,501
If you see from left to the right you can see Omkara

97
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:38,584
and if you see from down upward it looks like Alpha and Omega.

98
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:44,167
In those days Christ has said I am the Alpha and I am the Omega

99
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:46,292
and now we have made the animation,

100
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,167
we have no arrangement to show you there,

101
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:50,376
I don't know if you could arrange it somehow,

102
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:54,958
but you can see it clearly, what I have said can be proved.

103
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:01,209
So as you worship Ganesha you must worship Christ

104
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:05,250
in the same manner for all those who worship Ganesha.

105
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:09,292
Because I have seen that Hindus, they are stuck to Ganesha

106
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:18,542
and Christians are stuck to Christ, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga

107
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:23,167
they carry those traits. Ganesha is all right up to a point

108
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:31,709
and then it is important we must pray to his incarnation that is Christ.

109
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:38,417
In the same way those who worship Christ must also worship Ganesha

110
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:44,709
because he is the source, he is the potential of Christ.

111
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:50,834
All this was in the Divine plan, done with Divine discretion,

112
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:54,584
everything was done so beautifully but as I told you

113
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:58,626
human beings are good at massacring anything that is beautiful

114
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:02,751
and that's how it has happened. It's very, very sad

115
00:14:02,793 --> 00:14:06,042
and on his birthday today we have to decide

116
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:10,918
that he has to be born within us again, in a proper way,

117
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:14,793
that he is the Alpha and the Omega.

118
00:14:14,793 --> 00:14:19,167
At that time of his time I didn't know that anybody knew

119
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:23,668
about these symbols. These symbols also must have come

120
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:28,501
from unconscious to some of the great mathematicians

121
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,876
in long time and that's why these symbols

122
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:35,958
are used exactly like Alpha and Omega,

123
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,958
you see him clearly. It is so clear cut now in Sahaja Yoga,

124
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,334
we can prove so many things all tangible;

125
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:50,918
how Christ used to cure people, what did he do,

126
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:56,542
it's all tangible, we can prove it now in Sahaja Yoga, how it works out,

127
00:14:56,584 --> 00:15:01,668
how these powers work out, but we have to first of all

128
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:07,084
cleanse our lives, we have to lead a very honest,

129
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:13,959
powerful and pure life. I've seen those stalls outside,

130
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,542
I told them not to put up any stalls here

131
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:22,459
because they are making profit for themselves not for Sahaja Yoga.

132
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:27,958
Once Christ saw like that and he took a hunter and hit all of them,

133
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,542
now I can't do that. One should not encourage these people,

134
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:38,292
it's not a shopping centre, you have come for meditation.

135
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:43,209
Is all right if you need anything we have bought things for you,

136
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,417
if you buy them, there might be little profit, may not be,

137
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:50,459
but that will go to Sahaja Yoga, is not going to be used

138
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:55,042
for any private purpose. But these people from outside come

139
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:58,376
and put up a stall and you all run about means

140
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,292
you are still hanging around with that thing,

141
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,459
you have come here for what?

142
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:11,626
One should be all the time meditative in Ganapatipule,

143
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:15,958
all the time you should be in a meditative condition

144
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:19,417
and shouldn't get to these mundane things

145
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:25,084
which you always do outside also. But these people know

146
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,876
that you still have those weaknesses, that's why they have put up the stalls.

147
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:38,376
Leaders should stop all this nonsense, I've told not to eat outside.

148
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:41,459
Last time all of you suffered because of that

149
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,584
but still the stalls are on, that means see they know

150
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:48,958
there are some culprits who would like to buy things from them

151
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,250
and get sick and bring bad name to Sahaja Yoga.

152
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:56,959
So the first thing of Ganesha is that wisdom,

153
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,793
and that wisdom we see in the life of Christ,

154
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:09,501
from the very beginning, he was so confident of it

155
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:16,893
that at the age of twelve years he went and talked to these parses,

156
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:20,626
means the people who were priests, we still have priests

157
00:17:20,626 --> 00:17:23,876
and mullahs and these burgees and all of them,

158
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:28,334
these so called dharmamantandas, all over,

159
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:33,542
but he went and argued with them at that young age

160
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:36,584
and he was just saying what are you doing here.

161
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:45,918
What is this? What are you talking, all lip service.

162
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:49,793
He was discussing and talking to them

163
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:54,958
but his parents were perhaps, were frightened that these people

164
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,417
might kill him so they brought him to India,

165
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,542
he came to India for wisdom.

166
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:03,167
I don't know where is that wisdom missing now from Indians,

167
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:07,167
but must be this country was full of wisdom when he came

168
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:14,958
and stayed in India and we have lots of memories

169
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:20,626
about him, even the King Shaliman met him, is described in his book

170
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:25,292
that he met a man in Cashmere who was very saintly

171
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:27,959
and he asked him what's your name?

172
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,958
He said my name is Isa, see now imagine-Isa.

173
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:39,626
I is the word used in the Vedas for the Adi Shakti-

174
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:47,668
Sa means with.He said my name is Isa, he said from what country do you come.

175
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:52,084
He said I come from a country which is foreign to me

176
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:57,876
and this is my country. So this India, the Bharat,

177
00:18:57,876 --> 00:19:05,751
the Hindustan was the country of spirituality, and one should not try to compete

178
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:11,334
and feel inferior to other countries who have gone up materially higher,

179
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:13,042
you don't know where they are,

180
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:18,584
but we should be spiritually higher,

181
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:25,250
that's what Christ said. This is my own country, is clearly written,

182
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:27,084
that means Christ recognised

183
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:31,417
that this country of spirituality is his own.

184
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:37,042
So we belong to that country of spirituality

185
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:43,834
and not to the materialistic or to the mundane or the baser type of life.

186
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:58,000
In his life time which was so very short, whatever he has said,

187
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,417
every word is great but as I told you

188
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:10,167
that this Paul tried to completely change, re-edit the bible

189
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:15,250
and he's put lots of things in there, whatever weaknesses he has,

190
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:19,542
he has put them nicely.  Now recently I've got a book

191
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:25,459
which was hidden in a jar in Egypt

192
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:31,793
for about, till fifty years they discovered it, and this book is called

193
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:35,250
as the Library of Hamadhi. The place was called Hamadhi

194
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,834
were it was discovered, and what Christ has said,

195
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:44,626
what Thomas has written, when Thomas was coming to India he put all these things there, is very interesting.

196
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:49,958
About drinking, he said drinking begets debauchery,

197
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,958
it's a bad word to use and while Christians don't know.

198
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,584
On the contrary they think that drinking is allowed in Christianity,

199
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:04,000
very nicely. Was he mad to allow drinking?

200
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,376
How can he allow drinking

201
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:12,958
which goes against your awareness,

202
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,250
but they thought it was nice,

203
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:22,042
and that's what people have been using as a big attraction

204
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:24,584
that you can drink in Christianity.

205
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:32,958
So in the other religion, like Catholic religion, you could have only once the Marriage.

206
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:39,042
So they have one marriage and ten keeps, is all right,

207
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:41,334
allowed, in the bible is written,

208
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:44,417
only you can have one marriage you cannot divorce,

209
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:47,918
do what you like. No sense of morality

210
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:54,876
and everything came like a derailment towards themselves

211
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:58,876
and they accepted one after another, all kinds of nonsense,

212
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:04,876
and the basic thing of Christ's life is morality.

213
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:10,125
He is on the left side as you can see he's from Sri Ganesh

214
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:13,292
and then he establishes himself at Agnya,

215
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:18,668
but morality is the essence of his life,

216
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:24,709
what we call in India language his character.

217
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:33,459
Our character is how we lead a life of purity.

218
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:38,376
We indulge into all kinds of nonsense,

219
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:42,417
I mean if you go to the west you'll be amazed what things they do.

220
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:48,000
I mean you cannot even believe it

221
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:51,584
and I cannot even mention it to you, you won't believe

222
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:54,042
that these so called advanced countries

223
00:22:54,084 --> 00:22:56,084
are advancing towards what.

224
00:22:56,125 --> 00:23:04,209
Impossible we cannot conceive it even, such an impurity,

225
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:15,334
such a horrible, destructive immorality,

226
00:23:15,376 --> 00:23:17,668
and I don't know from where it comes,

227
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:19,834
I think it's something wrong with the genetics,

228
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:24,209
from where do they get these ideas. One after another

229
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:31,167
it's impossible to believe these people doing all these things

230
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:34,834
and then nicely dress up and go to church on Sunday,

231
00:23:34,876 --> 00:23:41,668
pray to God and come back. Now it is for you to decide,

232
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:45,459
you have to pull out all these people in your own countries

233
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:51,542
and you have to tell them this is all nonsense in the name of Christ,

234
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:59,042
in the name of God, you have to come up and talk about it,

235
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:03,668
same about Sri Ganesh. I have seen in Poona, I was surprised,

236
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:08,793
there was Ganesh ........... everybody was drinking nicely,

237
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:13,334
the horrible dirty songs, some western songs,

238
00:24:13,376 --> 00:24:16,958
some horrible cinema songs put up there

239
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:22,167
and everybody was using as a disco in front of Sri Ganesh.

240
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:27,209
Sahaja Yogis should go and object to this kind of a nonsense

241
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:30,918
they are in that how could they drink in the presence of Sri Ganesh.

242
00:24:30,918 --> 00:24:42,084
No wisdom of Sri Ganesha, no respect for his auspiciousness.

243
00:24:42,084 --> 00:24:46,376
Now not only drinking, doing all kinds of things.

244
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:50,793
Sri Ganesha has been shown by these tantrikas

245
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:55,000
as something so horrible which is also done

246
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:59,793
by so many psychologists, so called, in the west.

247
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:04,209
Thank God one of them is Mr. Freud is exposed now.

248
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:11,250
So the another quality of Ganesha, is shown in Christ's life,

249
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:18,918
is a devotion to Mother. In that book the,

250
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:25,751
Mary is telling them about knowledge,

251
00:25:25,751 --> 00:25:30,834
but this Paul objects to it,

252
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:37,125
and she says that this is what you have to achieve.

253
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:40,668
But he doesn't want to, he is arguing with her,

254
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:49,584
but then Thomas said that what Christ has said on the Cross

255
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:56,542
"behold the Mother". She is the Mother of Christ

256
00:25:56,542 --> 00:26:02,417
and how dare he insult her but just the opposite,

257
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:09,668
Paul never respected women, so he appointed,

258
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:14,876
I mean he called her as just a woman.

259
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:19,376
No respect for Mahalaxmi, no respect.

260
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:25,793
Can you imagine, just a woman,

261
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,000
and a big controversy going on

262
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:32,584
on these so called advanced people whether the women

263
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:35,793
should be ordained as priests or not.

264
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:38,125
We think we are very backward

265
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:42,501
but I think they are so backward in religion, nonsense.

266
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:45,668
We had.............

267
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:48,876
such people here and we respect the Mother

268
00:26:48,918 --> 00:26:56,292
as the Adi Shakti, she is the one we call her, the one who has created us,

269
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:58,250
she is the one who looks after us,

270
00:26:58,292 --> 00:27:01,709
for us she is important, Shakti is important,

271
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:07,542
they don't call her Shakti but a woman,

272
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:13,042
and supposed to be very advanced people,

273
00:27:13,084 --> 00:27:19,334
and all other nonsense they do in the name of advancement.

274
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:28,209
It's impossible to tell, my words fall short, feel so ashamed

275
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:32,042
in the name of Christ.

276
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:39,084
Today now when we are celebrating the pure life of Christ,

277
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:43,376
he came on this earth. They can't believe

278
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:48,000
that he could have been so pure. A criminal cannot believe

279
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:50,834
that others could be non criminal.

280
00:27:50,876 --> 00:28:00,250
So we have to within ourselves see if we have developed

281
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:06,668
that purity of mind that expresses through our eyes.

282
00:28:06,668 --> 00:28:12,334
Eyes have to become innocent, otherwise they have no effect.

283
00:28:12,376 --> 00:28:19,584
If you are hankering after attracting other people

284
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:22,334
and charming other people and all that,

285
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:25,709
you are not a Sahaja Yogi, there's no need.

286
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:29,125
Once the light is within yourself, people will know.

287
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:35,292
As Sahaja Yogis you have to have

288
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:40,000
the light of Christ in your own life.

289
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,626
He was a young man who came on this earth, and how he lived.

290
00:28:46,668 --> 00:28:53,000
He had nothing to do with Mary Magdalen, who was a prostitute,

291
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,334
but he stood by truth, and when people started stoning her

292
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:03,000
he stood up and said those who are not committed any sin

293
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:09,459
can throw the stone at me. What a strength of truth.

294
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:17,042
So not that only he was a pure personality but purity also

295
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:21,834
is expressed in truth and his compassion and love.

296
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:27,501
Such compassion he has expressed, such compassion.

297
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:31,876
I think Sri Ganesha got a little transformation.

298
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:36,958
Sri Ganesha is definitely very compassionate to people

299
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:43,751
who are worshipping him but those who go against them

300
00:29:43,793 --> 00:29:49,626
he hits them hard.............they have to suffer,

301
00:29:49,668 --> 00:29:53,834
aids, this, that, everything comes.

302
00:29:53,834 --> 00:30:01,292
But those who are pure people, Sri Ganesha protects.

303
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:04,292
But Christ is compassionate, he forgives

304
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:08,459
because he believes that there could be a transformation.

305
00:30:08,459 --> 00:30:15,417
At the level of Sri Ganesha he thinks is better

306
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:19,209
that let them be killed and be born again

307
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:23,459
because they're so impure but Christ had hopes

308
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:25,626
that he can transform people,

309
00:30:25,626 --> 00:30:30,376
but he could not, they crucified him.

310
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:35,793
What wonderful people they must have been to crucify Christ.

311
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:41,209
Brainless we should call them, absolutely

312
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:46,167
without any understanding about spirituality,

313
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:51,958
very insensitive to true knowledge.

314
00:30:51,958 --> 00:31:00,417
So for Sahaja Yoga, only the wise can follow.

315
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:07,167
It is not meant for stupid idiotic people nor it is meant for very smart ones.

316
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:13,542
Some people think they are very smart because they are successful in life,

317
00:31:13,584 --> 00:31:17,751
they can say some smart sentences, they can say something very,

318
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:23,668
outstandingly very sharp, it's not meant for that.

319
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:30,042
For that Christ has said meek in heart will inherit the earth.

320
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:36,876
Meek in heart, not those who think too much of themselves

321
00:31:36,876 --> 00:31:42,793
but for meek in heart will inherit the earth.

322
00:31:42,793 --> 00:31:45,751
Among Sahaja Yogis also only those who are meek in heart

323
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:52,668
will inherit the blessing of Mother. You have to be meek,

324
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:58,417
you have to be wise and with wisdom you'll become meek

325
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,125
because then you will see

326
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:03,459
where are we into this great cosmos,

327
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:10,334
that, you will feel that you have entered into this Kingdom of God,

328
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:15,958
for what? How? How have we come here?

329
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:20,709
How have you entered here? So many tried,

330
00:32:20,709 --> 00:32:25,459
thousands of years sacrificing this sacrificing that,

331
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:28,626
standing on their heads, fasting,

332
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:31,626
how is it suddenly we got this blessing?

333
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:33,876
How are we there?

334
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:39,417
When we start looking at this we become meek.

335
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:42,918
Is the blessing, is the grace.

336
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:45,417
It's not through our ego,

337
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:48,793
through our conditionings but is just the grace,

338
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:53,125
the compassion, the love the Sandrakaruna,

339
00:32:53,125 --> 00:33:01,250
and then you enjoy your transformed life,

340
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:09,417
the new dimension of spirituality which is in reality.

341
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:12,958
Now you know reality, you know totality, you know everything

342
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:16,459
but those who have not known themselves

343
00:33:16,501 --> 00:33:19,000
have not become Sahaja Yogis.

344
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:25,793
Tukarama has said in very simple words .............

345
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:31,709
the one who has known himself is the last one.

346
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:36,042
You can judge the chakras of others

347
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:38,167
but you can't judge your own chakras,

348
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:40,501
you can introspect others,

349
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:42,584
you can judge others but you cannot judge yourself.

350
00:33:42,584 --> 00:33:45,584
You know everything about others but about yourself

351
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:50,918
you don't know anything, then you are not Sahaja Yogis.

352
00:33:50,918 --> 00:33:52,751
First thing you must know yourself.

353
00:33:52,751 --> 00:33:55,834
What sort of an ego stuff I am doing.

354
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:58,250
What sort of a conditioning I have got.

355
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,918
Even now people have so many conditionings.

356
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:05,250
So there's a new discipline of Sahaja Yoga,

357
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:13,876
in the new discipline you have to be meek, humble and you have to be wise.

358
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,000
Every step of yours, every talk of yours,

359
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:22,376
everything should express wisdom

360
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:26,292
and the Sahaj discipline which automatically stops you

361
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:28,000
from doing wrong things.

362
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,709
Now say I'm walking down and some lady suddenly

363
00:34:30,751 --> 00:34:35,000
falls at my feet without even understanding that I am just walking,

364
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,584
I may fall down or catches hold of my feet,

365
00:34:39,626 --> 00:34:43,709
is all self oriented.

366
00:34:43,751 --> 00:34:48,167
I should see Mother, I should go and meet her,

367
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:51,834
I touched her feet, is all ego.

368
00:34:51,876 --> 00:34:57,042
A Sahaja Yogi stands in the back,

369
00:34:57,084 --> 00:35:05,834
real Sahaja Yogi is at the back from there he can enjoy because he knows I am everywhere.

370
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:14,084
He doesn't want to see me, nothing, just like this, standing.

371
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:18,834
He doesn't force his way in any way.

372
00:35:18,876 --> 00:35:23,000
Mother is here.

373
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,125
But this is what it is Christ has said, meek in heart.

374
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:33,084
There's a very big word "meek" and people don't understand meek

375
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:36,292
because in the west if you are meek people say you are weak,

376
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:38,918
you have to be aggressive. If they have to praise somebody

377
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:41,584
they'll say, oh he is very good, he is very aggressive.

378
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:45,876
I think their genetics are little lower than normal,

379
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:51,417
must be some animals in them otherwise how can they think

380
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:56,209
that to be aggressive is being something higher.

381
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:04,501
It's impossible, how can a person who is supposed

382
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:07,959
to be a higher person, could be like a devil.

383
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,084
How could Hitler say that he was a higher race

384
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:16,417
when he was himself a devil?

385
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:20,793
Is very nice for a devil to say I am a higher race.

386
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:29,376
So in dealing in Sahaja Yoga, the sweetness of natural meekness

387
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:33,959
not artificial of a businessman but a natural one

388
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:44,751
that makes you shine with your great, great spirituality.

389
00:36:44,793 --> 00:36:49,125
Nobody can touch you, I have told you, except for you.

390
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:54,584
You can only fall down but nobody can touch you,

391
00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:57,626
you are all protected from every angle

392
00:36:57,668 --> 00:37:01,376
but if you want to hit yourself I can't help it.

393
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:04,250
So again we come to Tukarama saying,

394
00:37:04,292 --> 00:37:10,209
as Christ has said "know thyself ".

395
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:16,000
First and foremost thing of introspectionis know thyself.

396
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:22,167
What you are doing,

397
00:37:22,209 --> 00:37:26,209
are you trying to look at yourself or not?

398
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:34,626
He has also said that we see a big beam into the eyes of others,

399
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:41,751
then it's all right, but the beam is in your eyes

400
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:44,918
and you start seeing the beam in others eyes and that's.

401
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:52,084
So in your meditation you have to sit down

402
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:55,376
and first of all introspect-Oh Christ,

403
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:59,918
Oh Sri Ganesha please give me wisdom to see myself

404
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:06,834
and understand what's wrong with me and understand

405
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:14,376
where do I lack all the qualities of a good Sahaja Yogi.

406
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:21,958
Just to meditate and you feel so happy, so joyous,

407
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:26,958
because virtue within you gives you joy.

408
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,209
But you don't say I'm virtuous,

409
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,459
you don't say that, but the virtue within you

410
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:35,334
when you discover, that gives you joy

411
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:42,292
and not your bad qualities and your hankerings,

412
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:45,958
your lust and greed, no it does not.

413
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:53,626
So we must really concentrate, even coming to Sahaja Yoga

414
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:58,751
people think how I can use it for say fame,

415
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:04,626
leadership you see is another myth. Then they sometimes think

416
00:39:04,668 --> 00:39:08,501
why not use it for making some money some how.

417
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:12,042
Some sort of a business they start.

418
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:17,250
Don't do any business with Sahaja Yoga or Sahaja Yogis,

419
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:20,292
I've told a hundred times, if you do it you'll be in trouble

420
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:22,834
and then don't come and tell me the trouble.

421
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:29,125
Sahaja Yoga is only Gods business, that's all.

422
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:39,376
Everything that you are doing is for God and that's why

423
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,542
you are doing it for your self.

424
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:45,084
So introspection is very important,

425
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:50,250
criticising others should be less and criticising yourself

426
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:52,459
and laughing at yourself is the best.

427
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:53,834
I laugh at myself many a times

428
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:57,376
and say many things like that, if you have noticed,

429
00:39:57,417 --> 00:40:06,042
that makes life so interesting. That will kill your ego.

430
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:12,250
How I am trying to assert myself and where is the meekness

431
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:18,542
that Christ has talked about. It is a natural goodness within us.

432
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:26,626
Once it shines and shows, you become so beautiful, so loveable.

433
00:40:26,668 --> 00:40:29,292
Whether you are sitting here near me or there

434
00:40:29,334 --> 00:40:32,292
I know who is that kind.

435
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:37,958
My heart just opens for such a personality.

436
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:49,292
I know who they are. But even if I know I will never tell you,

437
00:40:49,334 --> 00:40:53,125
it is better that you know yourself.

438
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:58,417
"Know thyself" is his message,

439
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:03,459
in the real way not with deception because you are deceiving yourself,

440
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:10,209
whom are you deceiving, know thyself without any deception,

441
00:41:10,209 --> 00:41:19,501
without any lies, with full concentration,

442
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:26,751
see where is your attention going, that's how you are going to rise,

443
00:41:26,793 --> 00:41:30,417
you are not going to rise by seeing the defects of others

444
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:35,542
but you are going to rise only by seeing your own defects.

445
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:38,459
Exactly this what Christ has said,

446
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:42,501
I am telling you in very, very simple words.

447
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:48,501
Then he has said love thy neighbour as thyself which is a very,

448
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:52,958
very big thing to say. Now is only possible in Sahaja Yoga

449
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:58,084
because you are collective, those who are not collective

450
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:01,876
how can they love their neighbour. I mean who is the neighbour then,

451
00:42:01,918 --> 00:42:04,167
nobody's the neighbour, they're outsiders,

452
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:07,668
but as soon as you become collective,

453
00:42:07,668 --> 00:42:11,918
see today there are fifty five nations, you are all so collective,

454
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:15,584
so moral, so beautiful, no complications, nothing,

455
00:42:15,626 --> 00:42:17,958
I am so overjoyed to see that

456
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:21,584
but to make it perfect we should introspect.

457
00:42:21,584 --> 00:42:26,958
Socially, collectively you people have improved a lot

458
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:29,958
but also individually within yourself

459
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:33,125
you have to improve for your own goodness.

460
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:39,584
So on this great occasion, we have to celebrate

461
00:42:39,584 --> 00:42:45,209
because really such a great amount of work was done by Christ

462
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,167
though neutralised by these horrible priests,

463
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:51,417
which is done in every country, in every religion

464
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:55,459
but now we should take a vow to save others

465
00:42:55,501 --> 00:43:00,292
who are taking the name of Christ and doing something

466
00:43:00,334 --> 00:43:05,709
just the opposite. If it could be done, if it could be achieved

467
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:09,876
through your lives Christ's work has been done.

468
00:43:09,876 --> 00:43:17,292
You have to now express Christ through your life, this is what it is.

469
00:43:17,334 --> 00:43:22,876
Through your life you can express it, through the purity,

470
00:43:22,918 --> 00:43:26,751
through the meekness, through the compassion

471
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:35,459
and the wisdom of Christ. Absolutely fearless was he

472
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:38,376
and that's why you have to be fearless

473
00:43:38,376 --> 00:43:44,125
because you have to be only afraid of God and nobody else,

474
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:47,834
that's all and if you have done nothing wrong

475
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:51,459
then there's nothing to be afraid of God also because he loves you very much.

476
00:43:51,459 --> 00:44:01,459
So be clear cut about everything, be understanding,

477
00:44:01,501 --> 00:44:08,626
you are all loveable people no doubt but you should be such

478
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:12,207
that you can adore yourself and love yourself

479
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,549
because of the virtues you have.

480
00:44:14,647 --> 00:44:18,981
May God Bless you all.
