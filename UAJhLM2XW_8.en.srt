1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:05,260
Nations land, where Hazrat Nizamuddin was buried,

2
00:00:07,358 --> 00:00:12,551
He was a great nabi and a sufi

3
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:20,623
and in his whole poetry he has used very symbolic things

4
00:00:21,303 --> 00:00:23,719
and for people of that level

5
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:27,562
they do not think of any religion being exclusive.

6
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,172
Even Mohammad saheb never talked only of Islam.

7
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:41,648
He talked of all the people who came before.

8
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:47,755
Like Abraham, then he talked of Moses, then he talked of Christ

9
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:51,231
and his mother specially in Quran he has talked it.

10
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:54,868
He never talked that I am something separate, never exclusive.

11
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,837
They can never be exclusive

12
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:02,050
because they know that all these great people came on this earth

13
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:06,177
to do the emancipation of human beings,

14
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:13,063
so their expertise and same as Hazarat Nizamuddin.

15
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:17,191
Long time back before my marriage when I came here

16
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:20,048
I was the first I think to put

17
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:24,084
a chadar of flowers on him

18
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:28,926
and my father also was a great soul.

19
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:35,389
He told me this is Hazarat Nizamuddin and his disciple was Kusro

20
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:38,141
was a great poet in Hindi language,

21
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,760
he is regarded as a very great poet

22
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:45,185
and he is the one who has written this beautiful song,

23
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:49,718
now the symbolic is this chap means is the Muslims.

24
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:51,602
Tilaks are the Hindus.

25
00:01:51,804 --> 00:01:55,852
I have given up everything once I met the reality.

26
00:01:56,272 --> 00:02:00,545
But it’s very deep and beautifully explained

27
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:04,615
and though they were born in the Muslim community,

28
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,891
they saw the reality in every religion

29
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:10,889
and these sufis are everywhere and I am surprised

30
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:12,557
they are in Turkey

31
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:17,159
and also they are now when I went to Tunisair they are there.

32
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:20,855
All over the world the sufis are there. These are also the sufis

33
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:24,573
but now they have become real Sahaja Yogi sufis

34
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,547
and this is something is exactly the Sahaja yoga.

35
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:38,649
Spontaneously, as soon as I saw you I lost all this nonsense.

36
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:42,721
Very spontaneous. Sahaj and this is what

37
00:02:42,937 --> 00:02:45,537
so beautifully expressed in this song.

38
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:49,449
I read, I read this song when I was a very young girl.

39
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:54,804
Wanted to see sometimes the tomb of Hazarat Nizamuddin Saheb.

40
00:02:55,656 --> 00:03:01,362
He was so great and whose brought so much luck to this Delhi 
(unclear)

41
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:04,353
aprat from that we are dam dam saheb (unclear)

42
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:07,391
We have all these great people very dear,

43
00:03:07,505 --> 00:03:09,372
it’s a very precious place.

44
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:13,196
So when I, we wanted to have a program here

45
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:16,298
the police people came and told us that

46
00:03:16,423 --> 00:03:19,949
don’t have it there because 
there are lots of Muslims they will kill you.

47
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:22,298
I said what sort of muslims there?

48
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:25,189
They said, they are all disciples of Nizamuddin.

49
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:27,965
I said, they are my people. Don’t worry.

50
00:03:28,102 --> 00:03:30,969
They won’t do anything to me. I know that.

51
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,645
So this oneness of spirit can only be felt

52
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:40,956
by people who have enlightenment.

53
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:43,547
Those who do not have enlightenment,

54
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,440
see everything separated different and fight

55
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:52,309
but those who are enlightened see.

56
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:56,099
I always give an example of a Marathi poet.

57
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:59,182
He went to, he was was himself a Tailor

58
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,237
and he went to see one another great saint

59
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:08,055
who was just a potter.

60
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:12,976
So this potter was kneading the mud.

61
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:17,380
When this saint the Tailor,

62
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:25,461
Namadeva went and saw him kneading the mud.

63
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:29,310
He just stopped and looked at him,

64
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:33,217
and what he says that, In Marathi says

65
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:36,431
”Nirgunachabheti alou sagunachi”

66
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:38,812
meaning, I came to see the

67
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:42,879
Nirakar, I came to see here formless

68
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:48,018
but here it is formless is in form. That is you.

69
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:52,231
Only a saint can appreciate a saint.

70
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:55,223
Only can a saint can understand a saint.

71
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:01,576
So, was Nizamuddin saheb, we have (unclear),

72
00:05:01,755 --> 00:05:06,735
we have got Middin saheb, we have many sufis in India

73
00:05:07,351 --> 00:05:12,124
and they are worshipped and respected by all the communities.

74
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:15,928
Shiridi Sainath was another one Nath,

75
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:19,529
regarded very great nath panthis.

76
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:21,465
They were all enlightened people.

77
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:24,084
They didn’t have this kind of a nonsense

78
00:05:24,243 --> 00:05:27,043
this dharam, that dharam, that dharam,no,

79
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:31,187
for them only oneness with God

80
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,296
and these two persons,

81
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:36,888
Ameer Kusros, (Unclear) When I was very young

82
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:40,422
and I was surprised people never understood him.

83
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:44,507
I wish you all could read his poetry and understand

84
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,358
with a symbolic meaning.

85
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:49,249
May God bless you.
