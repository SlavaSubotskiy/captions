1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,120
It is so wonderful for your Mother to see so many

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,240
beautiful Sahaja yogis assembled together,

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,280
on this day of Sahasrara.

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,440
I think the first era of Sahaja Yoga has ended now,

5
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,520
and new has started.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,800
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,440
the starting point was first the opening of the Sahasrara.

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,840
And gradually –

9
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,520
(it’s not on My …, that’s the point, it’s …, that’s better) –

10
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:36,120
and gradually moving towards the completion,

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,120
I find there are so many who are great Sahaja yogis today.

12
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,040
It is a very natural process of growth

13
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,240
that you have gone through.

14
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,760
The first one was, we can say,

15
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,680
is just the awakening of the Kundalini,

16
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,400
and piercing the fontanel bone area.

17
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,920
As you see on top of your head these bandhans,

18
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,960
that's how you too have in your head, same way.

19
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,680
And you have the chakras same way built in,

20
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,840
in your Sahasrara.

21
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,200
So in the first era of Sahaja Yoga we have awakened

22
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,400
the deities in your centers,

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,120
in the medulla oblongata and also in the brain.

24
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,400
But now the time has come for us to spread it

25
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,600
on a horizontal level.

26
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,920
And to move it on the horizontal level,

27
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,160
we have to understand how to go about it.

28
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,000
Like the seven colors of the rainbow,

29
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,720
we have got seven colors of the light of these centers,

30
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,800
of the chakras.

31
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,840
And when we start it from the back,

32
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,320
from the Mooladhara, bringing it up to the,

33
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:52,920
this side, Agnya, then it is placed in a different order,

34
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,160
if you see it clearly.

35
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:22,600
I mean to say that in the Sahasrara,

36
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,200
because it's a concave replacement,

37
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:34,040
is important to understand that the center

38
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:44,120
of the fontanel bone area corresponds to our heart.

39
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:07,560
So heart is the pivotal point for the second era now.

40
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,720
I hope you understand what I mean.

41
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,120
So if you have to place your attention to Sahasrara,

42
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,160
first thing you have to do is to pay attention to your heart.

43
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:01,160
In the Sahasrara, the Heart Chakra and the heart itself,

44
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,680
the Atma, coincide.

45
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:19,840
Means the Jagadamba becomes one with the heart –

46
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
that is the Atma.

47
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,200
So we see that here the yoga takes place.

48
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:54,280
At this point of time it is very important to understand

49
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,080
that we have to take a bigger step.

50
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:17,960
The whole Sahasrara moves in this way,

51
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,040
all these chakras throw their lights in this way,

52
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:34,320
in a clockwise manner; and this axis is the heart.

53
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,880
So the essence of all the religions, of all the prophets,

54
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,440
of all the incarnations is compassion,

55
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,520
and it’s placed in this Chakra of Heart.

56
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,520
Thus we understand that in the second era now,

57
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,560
we have to have compassion.

58
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,680
Is the manifestation now of the compassion.

59
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,600
If God Almighty had no compassion,

60
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:05,720
He would not have created this great universe.

61
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,560
Actually His Power, or the Adi Shakti,

62
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,720
is the embodiment of His compassion.

63
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:35,360
And this compassion has brought forth all the evolution

64
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:42,360
to human level, and even your emancipation as Sahaja yogis.

65
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,600
And compassion is always completely covered

66
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,760
with forgiveness.

67
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,640
So you can see, the Trinity meets at this point.

68
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,760
The Son of God is forgiveness,

69
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,120
is the embodiment of forgiveness.

70
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,040
So the God Almighty who is the witness,

71
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,520
the Mother who is the compassion

72
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,760
and the Child who is the forgiveness,

73
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,720
all of them meet at Heart Chakra, in the Sahasrara.

74
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:19,000
Now, one must learn how to improve Sahasrara itself.

75
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:32,800
You know the presiding deity of the Sahasrara very well.

76
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:47,520
Now the place of Sahasrara is in your head,

77
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,840
as you think it to be,

78
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,840
but it’s just the center of the whole universe.

79
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,360
To develop this, you have to pay attention

80
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:16,760
to your Heart Chakra in the fontanel bone area.

81
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,960
If you pay attention to the fontanel bone area,

82
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:42,280
then there you must establish the deity.

83
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:00,520
But this deity has to be first established into the heart.

84
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,160
Now you are very lucky people that you have the deity

85
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,160
in person with you.

86
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,520
The people who got realization before I came on this Earth

87
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,560
had to imagine the deities,

88
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,600
and in that imagination they were never perfect.

89
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,280
But as they say that at Sahasrara She is Mahamaya –

90
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,280
that is how it is described –

91
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,720
so if you also see the person,

92
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,840
you may not be knowing fully that person

93
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,200
or in the perfect way or a complete way,

94
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,720
because Mahamaya Shakti is much greater

95
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,600
than your imagination.

96
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,400
That is why one has to surrender.

97
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:50,200
With your limited imagination of brain,

98
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,840
one cannot see the deity.

99
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,200
Also it is said She is Bhakti Gamya:

100
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,280
you can know through bhakti, through devotion.

101
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,680
So the devotion has to be there,

102
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,040
but the devotion has to be a very clean devotion,

103
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,880
in the sense there should be no malice in the heart.

104
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,200
Heart should be clean.

105
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,520
Heart, to keep it clean is very difficult.

106
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,320
Always human beings have a relative understanding of

107
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,320
of reality,

108
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,360
but reality is absolute.

109
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,200
So to achieve that, one has to get rid of all

110
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:17,320
the other kind of impurities that are within the heart.

111
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:30,320
So in the beginning we try to achieve our realization,

112
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,160
not with very clean heart.

113
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,520
At that time we had lots of attachments,

114
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,600
we were identified with false things.

115
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:02,000
And also we thought by getting realization

116
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,360
we’ll become very powerful people.

117
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,520
After realization also,

118
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,520
we started indulging into petty things.

119
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,760
We started asking for favors for our relations, friends,

120
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,080
mothers, sisters;

121
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,920
and the women thought of their husbands

122
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,120
and their brothers, children.

123
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,120
They all asked for the blessings of all those

124
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,200
with whom they were entangled.

125
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,280
All this entanglement you got over, I know, very soon.

126
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,360
Now the job of a Avatara is such

127
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:40,480
that He has to fulfill the desires of His bhaktas.

128
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,880
The job of an Avatara is such that He has to fulfill

129
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:58,120
the desires of His bhaktas, His disciples.

130
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,200
For example, Shri Krishna was asked by gopis that

131
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,080
“we want You to be with us,

132
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,080
individually with every one of us.”

133
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,760
So He divided Himself into many Krishnas,

134
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,880
and He was with every one of them.

135
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,600
But that was a very divine desire, I think;

136
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,760
that was a very divine desire of the gopis.

137
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,040
But when you asked Me about your brothers, sisters,

138
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,840
mothers, fathers, I tried to do that,

139
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,080
whatever was possible.

140
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,120
Also the kshema that you asked for,

141
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,520
ashrams you asked for,

142
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,800
all the things that you needed,

143
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:30,520
was there for your desire to be fulfilled.

144
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,960
So at the Krishna's level it was

145
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,200
"Yoga kshemam vahamyaham."

146
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,040
So the kshema was looked after at Krishna's level,

147
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,760
because it was promised.

148
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,960
But what next, in the new era that has to come?

149
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,160
As you have now good families, good ashrams,

150
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:27,360
good jobs, everyone is happy, let us think of the next era.

151
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,840
Next era is of compassion, as I told you.

152
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,280
But any one of the chakras are weak in you still;

153
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,440
the light that becomes white because of the seven colors

154
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,600
may dim out, or may be defective.

155
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,360
So, all the chakras that are within us

156
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,520
are to be looked after.

157
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:35,680
To pay attention to every chakra, and put compassion,

158
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,920
the feeling of compassion on these chakras.

159
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,160
Now let us take the Chakra of Shri Ganesh.

160
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,640
You pay attention to Shri Ganesha and

161
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,640
establish Him through your thought –

162
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,320
because now your thought is divine –

163
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,320
in the Mooladhara Chakra, with great respect.

164
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,680
Here now, you have to know that in the first era

165
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,200
of Sahaja Yoga I could not have talked of these things to

166
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,720
of these things to you, of …

167
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:02,400
This is much subtler doing, subtler work.

168
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,760
Now put your feeling on that chakra.

169
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,760
Chakra is the pradesha, is the country,

170
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,920
and the king is Shri Ganesh.

171
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,880
And that's the country.

172
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,920
Now when you put your attention onto that chakra,

173
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,040
put your feelings towards Him,

174
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:58,680
of feeling of love and adoration to Him, to begin with.

175
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,120
And then to manifest compassion,

176
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,160
you have to ask nothing but one thing,

177
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:16,960
that "O God of Innocence, give innocence

178
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,080
to all the people of the world."

179
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,480
But first you have to be innocent to ask that;

180
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,160
otherwise it is unauthorized asking, or you can say,

181
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,240
you have no right to ask.

182
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,080
So to understand innocence

183
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,720
you should try to understand yourself,

184
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,800
how your mind is working.

185
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,480
When you, say, look at anyone, do you feel that you

186
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,640
should possess that person?

187
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:26,160
Do you feel unduly attracted, or something base feeling

188
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,240
comes into your mind?

189
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,600
For an innocent person,

190
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,360
a beautiful person, or a woman,

191
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,720
or a beautiful scene or a beautiful creation,

192
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,720
the first thing should happen that he becomes thoughtless –

193
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,760
there’s no thought.

194
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,360
So if there is no thought, there's no question

195
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,640
of having any expression of possessiveness

196
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,720
or any kind of a baser feeling.

197
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:44,760
But if you pray to Shri Ganesha, also unauthorized

198
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,480
a little bit, that "Please make me innocent,

199
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,720
so that I'm empowered to ask You for this boon,

200
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:03,680
that wherever I go I become the source of innocence.

201
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:24,480
So that I emit innocence: when people look at me,

202
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,520
they feel I am innocent."

203
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,360
This is compassion,

204
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,840
the compassion to ask Him to give you

205
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,920
the power of compassion itself.

206
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:07,520
So that, as you see here these beautiful centers, as if

207
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:14,640
the light starts moving horizontally;

208
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:33,160
it starts moving on the sympathetic nervous system.

209
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,840
So you become the powerful innocence yourself.

210
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,960
You don't become stupid or childish,

211
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,200
but you become child-like.

212
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:06,320
The whole behavior is extremely dignified and innocent.

213
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,880
Normally if you find a person who is dignified,

214
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:19,000
is normally he’s not an innocent person,

215
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,960
because he puts up a show – it's a deliberation

216
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,960
to become serious and show that he’s very dignified,

217
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,800
to impress others.

218
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,640
And child doesn’t put up the show of innocence, of

219
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:49,720
of dignity or anything, because the child is not aware

220
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,040
of deliberations.

221
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:09,520
But you develop that rare combination of innocent dignity.

222
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,440
Now the other quality of, say, Shri Ganesha starts

223
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:28,320
expressing itself on horizontal level,

224
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,600
that you become discreet.

225
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,760
But that is a power, I'm again say,

226
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,920
the power of discretion you develop.

227
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,800
Now one must understand the difference between

228
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,800
the power of discretion, and discretion itself.

229
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,880
So “the power” means it acts.

230
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,360
For example, you may not speak, but if you are

231
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,320
but if you are standing somewhere

232
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,440
the discretion itself will act in the situation.

233
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,200
Like a Sahaja yogi, supposing is a good Sahaja yogi,

234
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,840
is going in a train, and the train has an accident –

235
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
mostly it will not have, but has – nobody will die.

236
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:04,640
So you establish the discretion which is power itself,

237
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,480
that acts by itself.

238
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,360
You don't have to say that you act, it acts,

239
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,760
but you just become the vehicle,

240
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,720
a beautiful clean vehicle of that discretion.

241
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,080
Then you should believe,

242
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,200
now you are spreading horizontally.

243
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,600
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

244
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,440
you needed to see Me in person.

245
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,120
You needed to see Me in person.

246
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,840
As we say in Sanskrit, a “dhyeya”: is the target.

247
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,120
You wanted the target in front of you.

248
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,360
(But see, there’s no word in English!) Dhyeya:

249
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,400
whatever is to be achieved.

250
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,960
(Because there’s no word in the English language, what to do?)

251
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,000
So now when you wanted that all the time,

252
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,720
and you felt happy, secured, joyous

253
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,720
when you had that in person before you.

254
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,080
Then in the second era, now,

255
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,640
you will not desire so much that Mother should be there –

256
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,200
you'll take it over from Me.

257
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,400
This is the divine desire I'm telling you about,

258
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,600
and you have to work on that from today onwards.

259
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,360
I am with you, you know that;

260
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,320
but need not be in this body,

261
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,360
because I don’t know if I exist in this body or not.

262
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,880
But once this desire starts working,

263
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,760
you will see tremendous miracles happening.

264
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,960
When the child is born to a mother,

265
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,520
automatically she gets milk.

266
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,520
So the nature is so connected with the whole thing.

267
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,800
In your divine desire also it is connected.

268
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,840
And it is very evident when you are a divine person.

269
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,400
So you may find Me anywhere:

270
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,480
you are walking on the street,

271
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,720
suddenly you might find Mataji walking with you.

272
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,320
So this is the second era we have started,

273
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,760
and you should not be shocked

274
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,600
if you see Me sitting on your bed

275
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,520
and putting My hand on your head.

276
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,600
Or you may see Me in the form of Christ

277
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,800
walking into your room,

278
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,560
or as Shri Rama.

279
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,520
That has to happen,

280
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,720
so you should be prepared.

281
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,280
Already so many miracles have taken place on you,

282
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,520
but on a grosser level.

283
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,400
We have seen the light coming on My head,

284
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,320
and the photographs have shown some miracles to you.

285
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,360
But many things will happen,

286
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:59,480
that you will see something that you could never imagine.

287
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,040
This has to happen, just to convince you

288
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,640
that you have reached a certain height of your evolution

289
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,880
in the new area of Pragyalok.

290
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,480
Because this is a new state into which

291
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,600
now you will be entering, on a horizontal basis.

292
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:54,520
In this area you will give up asking for gross things,

293
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:11,320
and also for anything subtler, anything that is subtle.

294
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,080
The asking will disappear,

295
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,400
and that is the time you’ll become very powerful.

296
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,400
Whatever I say happens, as you know;

297
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:46,760
only thing, I cannot command you to be evolved.

298
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:04,680
The Kundalini's work in you has been done, quite a lot.

299
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,840
Now the new work of compassion,

300
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,160
of spreading it to others has to be done by you.

301
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,320
As the light grows brighter and brighter,

302
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:44,400
the area it covers becomes bigger and bigger.

303
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,360
So you become the giver of compassion.

304
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,840
In My last lecture, which you have heard already,

305
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,160
I have requested you how to do tapah.

306
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,360
(Oh, I see, I’m sorry. All right.)

307
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:34,040
With a complete surrendered mind you have to go through

308
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:39,880
the pilgrimage, say, of this castle.

309
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,560
This is one of the glimpses of the tapah

310
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,160
that you have to do, because I am told

311
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:08,160
some of you had to get into little difficulties,

312
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,760
and you people suffered a little bit

313
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,920
on your way for the pilgrimage.

314
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:33,920
But it is fun to be venturesome and to get into places

315
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,480
where the devils dare not go.

316
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,040
Fun: no word!

317
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,280
They have never fun! Let us see, it is miserable!

318
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:09,040
And if you know how to get fun out of the so-called

319
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,400
discomforts, then you should know

320
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,680
you are on the right lights.

321
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,440
And as you start becoming discreet automatically,

322
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,440
you should know you are progressing well.

323
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,800
As you become more peaceful and your temper

324
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,920
vanishes in the thin air as soon as you see somebody

325
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:56,080
attacking you, then know that you are progressing well.

326
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:23,320
As soon as you see a ordeal or a calamity falling on

327
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:28,240
the personality and you do not get worried about it,

328
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,840
then know that you are progressing.

329
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,880
No amount ….

330
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:52,280
When no amount of artificiality can impress you,

331
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,280
then know that you are progressing.

332
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:13,200
No amount of material well-being in others

333
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,240
makes you unhappy, no more unhappy,

334
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,360
then know that you are progressing well.

335
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:37,000
No amount of

336
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,840
labor or

337
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:58,000
or troubles are sufficient to become a Sahaja yogi.

338
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,560
Any – whatever you may try, one cannot become a Sahaja yogi,

339
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:08,760
while you have got it without any effort.

340
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,800
So you are something special.

341
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,800
So this, once you understand that you are special,

342
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,960
you will become humble about it.

343
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:41,120
Then when it happens to you that you’ve humbled down

344
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,920
when you see you have achieved something,

345
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,160
that you have some powers,

346
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:52,080
that you are emitting innocence, that you are discreet,

347
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,800
and as a result of that you become more compassion,

348
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,040
humbler personality, a sweeter personality,

349
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,440
then you should believe

350
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,480
that you are in the heart of your Mother.

351
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:35,120
This is what is the sign of the new Sahaja yogi now

352
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:44,760
in the new era, who has to move with new force.

353
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:02,080
Where you will grow so fast that without meditation,

354
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,200
you will be in meditation;

355
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:16,160
without being in My presence, you will be in My presence;

356
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:33,040
without asking, you will be blessed by your Father.

357
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,960
This is what you are in for;

358
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:45,160
and again I welcome you to this new era today,

359
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,360
on this great day of Sahasrara.

360
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,640
May God bless you all.
