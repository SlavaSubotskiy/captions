1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:04,492
in any place
where we want to start

2
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:11,241
a work or do anything about it, because He
is innocence and innocence was created

3
00:00:11,442 --> 00:00:14,110
before everything else was created.

4
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:23,268
Is the most powerful power, I should say,
innocence.

5
00:00:23,593 --> 00:00:27,977
And then we’ll do the Guru Puja which is
actually

6
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:33,237
the Adi Guru, the Primordial Master, who
incarnated on this Earth many a times.

7
00:00:33,438 --> 00:00:41,347
And, as you know, as Dattatreya He was born,

8
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:48,252
as Janaka, Nanaka and many others.

9
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,777
That principle is within us and that is
very important

10
00:00:51,978 --> 00:00:59,273
that we should develop the principle
of Guru Nanak or Janak

11
00:00:59,474 --> 00:01:05,463
or anyone of these primordial masters.
Because if the Spirit is the master,

12
00:01:05,664 --> 00:01:14,208
we have to become the master of ourselves.
And the power of the masters are

13
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:26,677
that they are essences of the innocence –
of the creator,

14
00:01:28,147 --> 00:01:34,059
of the sustainer and the destroyer.

15
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:40,786
They are the innocence of all these. Out
of them – this great personality –

16
00:01:40,987 --> 00:01:47,959
innocence of these three personalities
was created this great incarnation.

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,577
And their innocence is shown by their
detachment to things – they live everywhere

18
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:58,573
just like other human beings – married,
living in the families,

19
00:01:58,774 --> 00:02:05,554
but absolutely detached. Unless and until
this principle is awakened in you,

20
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:08,954
you cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

21
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:17,338
First of all, this principle of Guru must
be awakened in you which gives you balance

22
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:23,970
and then the ascent has to be brought in
through the Spirit, the Atma.

23
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:27,958
That is done by the Shakti, by
the Kundalini Herself.

24
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,080
She’s the Shakti, She’s the womb. She’s
the one Who nourishes, first of all.

25
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:39,655
She nourishes that power within us,
nourishes us, nourishes all our chakras.

26
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:48,183
By which She cures our mental, emotional,
physical, spiritual being.

27
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:51,274
Because sometimes we bow to wrong type
of people,

28
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:54,600
our spiritual being is also very much hurt.

29
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:58,364
And after that, after She has achieved
that,

30
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:07,956
then She ascends through your fontanel bone
and gives you the Self Realization.

31
00:03:08,157 --> 00:03:13,492
So it is She who is the giver of your
moksha.

32
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:18,724
She is the one who is the giver of
the peace, of the joy,

33
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:24,297
and this Mother of yours resides in you
and She gives you the Realization.

34
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:29,027
So we worship Her as the power within you,
so that you are empowered,

35
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:37,633
you become powerful. But this power makes
you the master.

36
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:42,034
When She comes in the Void area, She makes
you the Master

37
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:49,808
because She enlightens that Guru principle
within you and you become the Master,

38
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:55,303
you become the master of yourself and by
that you become the Master of others also.

39
00:03:55,504 --> 00:04:00,120
The one who is not the Master of oneself
cannot be the Master of others.

40
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:05,134
So it works out, first of all, on you and
then it radiates.

41
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:10,640
And that radiation makes others also accept
you as the guru.

42
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:20,572
The dynamism and that compassionate
attitude

43
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:27,014
all develops through this Guru principle.

44
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:32,656
But this is the blessing of the Kundalini,
the Womb, the Mother,

45
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:35,937
the one who we call as Aquarius.

46
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:42,616
This is residing within us and we have to
just accept

47
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:48,826
Her manifestation and welcome Her with
open heart.

48
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:55,593
And know that today is the day when we are
expecting human beings

49
00:04:55,794 --> 00:05:01,593
to rise to that level where they become
compassion, love, affection.

50
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:08,493
This is the new awareness with which we are
going to be

51
00:05:08,694 --> 00:05:12,278
completely fulfilled and unless and until
that happens

52
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,284
there’s no chance for the emancipation,
no doubt about it.

53
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:25,405
We have worked out so many things in so
many places

54
00:05:25,606 --> 00:05:30,271
and every place, I find, has a different
problem.

55
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:36,017
The most difficult, I find, is America,
it’s like Mathura

56
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:39,310
where Shri Krishna had to go and establish
Himself,

57
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:45,237
that was the Kingdom of Shri Krishna and
where Kamsa was ruling.

58
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:50,981
So the people in Mathura were the most
difficult people because they were governed

59
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:56,313
by devils and the devils have a capacity
to dominate good people.

60
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,249
They’re all so dominated that even where
Shri Krishna lived,

61
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:08,550
they tried to go and harm Him and kill Him
and all that.

62
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:14,056
And all the dynamism of these people from
Mathura was killed by Kamsa

63
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:19,784
who was to be killed by Shri Krishna.

64
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:23,345
Surprisingly, the first day I came to New
York for the puja,

65
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:29,730
the first day it was written “Parivartani
Ekadashi”.

66
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:36,595
Now “Ekadesha” is the power with which
the people are going to be destroyed.

67
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:41,747
Now that is “Parivartani” means the one
by which you are going to be transformed.

68
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:46,327
So, how is it the power that is going
to destroy is going to transform you.

69
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:52,929
Firstly, it will destroy all that is
oppressive, all that kills your dynamism,

70
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,465
all that makes you slave, that is going
to be destroyed.

71
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,860
Secondly, people will be frightened,
the halfbaked ones

72
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:07,142
who are neither here nor there, that we’ll
be destroyed and that awe will change them.

73
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:11,750
Thirdly, when you see that your kith and
kin are going to be destroyed,

74
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:16,324
then you’ll have much more compassion,
much more tolerance for them

75
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:20,835
and you’ll try to save them all. So that is
what it is,

76
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:27,276
where Shri Krishna had to raise a complete
mountain on His fingertip,

77
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:32,405
you see like this, to the right side,
“Govardhandhari” He was called.

78
00:07:32,606 --> 00:07:35,991
That is what is my job here, is to raise
the mountain again

79
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:42,280
and raise it on my finger tip like that.
But this finger has to be strong

80
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:50,089
and this finger is nothing but the Sahaja
Yogis of America and they have to help

81
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:58,188
by their dynamic behaviour and by their
proper understanding, responsibility

82
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:05,096
as the people belonging to this great
nation of Fatherhood.

83
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:10,836
This is the finger of the Father and that
Fatherhood has to be dynamic,

84
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:19,494
has to be overpowering and has to be very
responsible.

85
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:23,200
And in that responsibility you learn so
many things –

86
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:26,853
so that’s my job is, that’s my goal is.
She (tv host) asked me in the TV,

87
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:30,294
“What is your goal, Mother?” I didn’t tell
her that I have to raise

88
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:33,646
the mountain on my finger, you see, she
would never have understood that.

89
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,516
But that is what one has to do here.

90
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:42,484
To raise the mountain and I find it’s like
that – Mountainous.

91
00:08:42,685 --> 00:08:48,550
And base of the mountain seems to be Houston
which is the most difficult part of it,

92
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:55,143
they just don’t move, they just don’t move,
its jada it's very, very ‘tamasic’,

93
00:08:55,344 --> 00:09:00,577
it’s so full of ignorance and so full
of heaviness.

94
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:04,845
That is the most difficult part and that’s
why – for Houston specially –

95
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:10,399
we should do a nice puja to the Kundalini
that She rises in Houston.

96
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,289
May God bless you all.

97
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:21,516
Can you give me the handkerchief.

98
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:41,497
Yogi: Today it’s said it’s Anant
Chaturdashi. Shri Mataji: Uh?

99
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:45,406
Yogi: Anant Chaturdashi.
Shri Mataji: Today? Ah-ah!

100
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:49,493
That’s great! Yes, must be. I was wondering
Anant Chaturdashi.

101
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:55,347
Anant Chaturdashi is the day when we

102
00:09:57,336 --> 00:10:03,712
‘visarjan’– dissolve Shri Ganesha
in the water.

103
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:07,581
(Hindi : it’s that day we put the Ganesha
in to the water)

104
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:13,578
Because He’s established for ten days and
after ten days, He’s born on the fourth,

105
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:19,531
after ten days He’s dissolved in the water
so that everywhere His Power is spread

106
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:23,912
through the water. That’s why no wonder
there was a puja.

107
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:27,661
Ganesha settled down into the water.

108
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:31,980
That is Ananta Chaturdashi. Ananta is the,
is Shri Ganesha.

109
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:36,831
Ananta means which cannot be destroyed.
Innocence cannot be destroyed.

110
00:10:37,032 --> 00:10:41,753
And that is why is the Ganesh Chaturdashi
means the day

111
00:10:41,954 --> 00:10:47,062
when Ganesha is dissolved in the water,

112
00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:56,117
in the ocean or He is created, worshipped
for ten days and again given back.

113
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:04,076
So it’s a very great day today, I should
say, like the resurrection of Christ

114
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:10,439
that you are,

115
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:16,850
you had Christ here, He lived with you,

116
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:21,619
and then went back to His Father. Father is
the ocean

117
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,996
and that’s what in India they do, establish
Him on the fourth day

118
00:11:27,197 --> 00:11:30,631
and on the tenth day they put Him back
to the ocean.

119
00:11:30,832 --> 00:11:34,360
Yogi: We used to do the same thing in
our school. Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

120
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,669
Yogi: I said we used to do the same
thing in our school. Shri Mataji: Eh?

121
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,906
Yogi: We used to do the same thing in our
school.

122
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:43,062
Other yogi: He says that he did the same in
his school, they used to make the Ganesha.

123
00:11:43,263 --> 00:11:48,444
Shri Mataji: Really? What school?
Yogi: (School name).

124
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:54,282
Yogi: So we used to have a statue and four
of the guys used to carry them on.

125
00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:57,212
Shri Mataji: But no one understands. They
just do it without understanding

126
00:11:57,413 --> 00:12:01,246
what they are doing about it. So it’s
a thing, even in India

127
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:03,772
how many people know about Ganesha,
no one knows.

128
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,038
Yogini: In Maharastra. Shri Mataji: In
Maharastra, they worship Him a lot

129
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:10,912
but they don’t know much about it. They
don’t know how much He’s important,

130
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:15,028
about what He represents, how did He came
on this earth, nothing they know.

131
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:19,563
We have become very superficial that way.

132
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:27,467
But at least it keeps your attention by
doing all these things, “there”.

133
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:31,857
You see, this is the advantage of in India,
the children have to be little bit

134
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:37,389
pinned down to a thing they, by festivals
and all that they try to then find out

135
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,241
what is this, what is that. Their attention
is more there, not outside so much,

136
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:43,758
you see, that’s the thing is.
