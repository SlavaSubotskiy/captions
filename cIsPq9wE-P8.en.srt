1
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,080
Today we are going to worship

2
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,920
the Devi, we call her Amba,

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,480
and by many other names.

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,160
She is the last, we should say, the ''residual power''

5
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,120
When she has done everything

6
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,080
she becomes the Kundalini

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,200
and settles in the triangular bone of yours.

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,880
This is the Mooladhara Chakra.

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,960
But actually she is expressed

10
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,840
more on the left side,

11
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,560
because that time she is purely the Amba.

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,000
This left side is a very, very important

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,320
thing for all the human beings.

14
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,880
lf you have no left side, you cannot balances to begin with.

15
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,320
And it is said that

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,080
she gives you a real personality

17
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,240
of a Sahaja Yogi.

18
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,160
That is, your left side, if it is weak,

19
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,160
then you have to worship her;

20
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:30,400
and request her that ''Please enrich our left side''.

21
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,920
By enriching your left side,

22
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,920
what she does, she is a comforter,

23
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,240
So, what does she give you? First of all, she makes you rest.

24
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,200
It is said that she makes you rest.

25
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,960
That is, she makes you sleep.

26
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,920
lf you are too much thinking about future

27
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,920
and you are so much indulging into the futuristic planning,

28
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,920
you have some problems;

29
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,840
but the best thing is if you can sleep,

30
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,560
then it is a great comfort,

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,360
it is a very great comfort to you that you can sleep

32
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,880
and that you can take some rest.

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:31,680
Without her you cannot sleep: absence of her, you cannot sleep.

34
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,880
So sleeping is a very important function

35
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,240
of the body, which is brought forth by the left side.

36
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,960
That's why we worship her,

37
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,360
because she should give us rest.

38
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,040
She's the one who gives you peace;

39
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,760
She's the one who

40
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,400
gives you also illusions,

41
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,080
called as Bhranti.

42
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,720
She gives you all the artistic talents,

43
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,080
she protects you.

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,400
But this part that is she is

45
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,280
creating illusions for you

46
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,640
that's very, very important.

47
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,880
Because those people who are against Divine,

48
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:50,280
who are trying to be away from the reality,

49
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,880
she creates illusions for them.

50
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,800
So she separates you from those people,

51
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,320
while you know the reality

52
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,440
and all such people who are

53
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,240
troubling or trying to destroy her work

54
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,520
She is the one who creates illusions.

55
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,160
She is the one who resides as the Kundalini.

56
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:35,120
So we can say that part of her is the Kundalini,

57
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,200
but another part that she has

58
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,960
is the one which resides in the left side.

59
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,960
Now there are seven

60
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,760
levels

61
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,840
which she resides.

62
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,240
Once you start enjoying her on the first level,

63
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,280
then She has all these qualities described to you.

64
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,840
That She is peace,

65
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,920
She is the one who gives you love,

66
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,160
She is the one who creates

67
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,920
all the beautiful things for you.

68
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,680
She is the Mother.

69
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,200
And what She expects you is to enjoy her protection,

70
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,960
enjoy her love and be always

71
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,400
under her complete protection.

72
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,920
So this is a very important part of her work.

73
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,440
And the second one is that She is the Kundalini.

74
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,360
So She also acts on seven levels.

75
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,920
Seven levels She moves, we can say horizontally,

76
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,040
and seven levels she moves upward.

77
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,840
And all these seven levels, on both of the sides.

78
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,560
She does tremendous work for us.

79
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,400
How she protects us through these seven levels, is like this,

80
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,720
that even if you start going towards the left side,

81
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,000
there are seven Deities

82
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,880
which try to throw you back into normalcy.

83
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,360
There are Shankini, Dhankini, these are the names.

84
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,280
And by that you try to come to normal conditions.

85
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,920
Now for example, many psychosomatic diseases

86
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,160
which come to us, like cancer and so many others;

87
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,240
psychosomatic means it is physical

88
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,960
as well as it is emotional.

89
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,000
So these psychosomatic troubles

90
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,960
start coming from the left side.

91
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,400
Sometimes you are too much on the right side,

92
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,800
then suddenly you are thrown to the left side, suddenly.

93
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,080
And then the movement like a pendulum, you can go any far.

94
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,080
But there are seven powers on the left-hand side

95
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,360
which protect you from getting into these diseases;

96
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,040
also reducing

97
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,240
their intensity.

98
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:27,200
So at one time, she is the one who is peace giving,

99
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,680
she is the one who looks after you and protects you,

100
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:43,120
and she is the one who saves you from psychosomatic diseases.

101
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,200
ls a very powerful entity.

102
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,840
lf she was not there l don't know what would have happened.

103
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,200
So we should worship her within ourselves.

104
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,840
We should respect her, and understand her;

105
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,520
she is your Mother.

106
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,480
As Kundalini she is your particular Mother.

107
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,120
She is the one, Amba,

108
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,880
who gives you your second birth.

109
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,240
And as the left side

110
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,640
goddess she gives you

111
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,120
a very good support in your ascent.

112
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,560
A very good support in your ascent.

113
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,120
Without her you could not balance yourself.

114
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,000
This goes too far sometimes

115
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,240
when people are too much on the right side.

116
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Then they get diseases which are very funny.

117
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,280
They can get heart-attack, they can get paralysis.

118
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,840
They also get the right side completely paralyzed.

119
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,920
They can't walk, they can't lift themselves.

120
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,240
This is too much of right side movement.

121
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,800
So then she is the one

122
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,280
who makes you feel bad about it.

123
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,120
She is the one who suggests that you give up your right side

124
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,920
and take more to the left side.

125
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,720
So that doesn't mean that right side,

126
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,840
if it is cured by the left side,  it is very good.

127
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,920
For example, a person who is very arrogant, egotistical,

128
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,720
such a man may become absolutely docile,

129
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,000
and people might think he is cured. No. He is on the left side.

130
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,360
Though he has become docile, still he is not normal.

131
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,160
Still he is very much wrong because he is on the left side.

132
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,680
On the left side one starts getting many diseases like schizophrenia

133
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,320
on the upper level of this group.

134
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,920
This side these same seven centers

135
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,440
act to give you very serious troubles.

136
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,880
One of them is that people become schizophrenic.

137
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,120
It can be cured;

138
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,480
it can be cured if you can move that person to the center.

139
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,880
And by Kundalini awakening you can do it.

140
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,000
Then people also become mad, lunatic.

141
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,200
But all the troubles of the right side disappear.

142
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,320
Such people who have moved to the left side

143
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,160
won't have liver problems.

144
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,640
They might have enlarged liver,

145
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,240
but over-active liver they won't have.

146
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,200
They won't have other symptoms like asthma, heart attack.

147
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,800
They cannot have heart attack. They'll give heart attacks to others

148
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,800
but they themselves don't get heart attacks.

149
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,280
So this

150
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,200
sudden movement of your attention into the left side

151
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,800
is all the time guarded by these seven entities,

152
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,520
or goddesses,who look after you.

153
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,800
But still if you go on with it:

154
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,920
for example you go to the false gurus;

155
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,560
then what do the false gurus do?

156
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,800
They put you to your left side.

157
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,880
They'll give you a name, some name,

158
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,320
it could be the name of a servant, or anyone

159
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,240
whom they have captured and whom they are looking after

160
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,880
as a kind of a possession for others.

161
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,160
This is tantrika, they people possess

162
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,040
the spirits of these dead people

163
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,360
and use them to entice you.

164
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,960
So when you start

165
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,800
getting into the left side by any means,

166
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,960
you can get it by worrying too much,

167
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,880
you can get it by feeling very sorry for something,

168
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,920
or crying, weeping, anything,

169
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,440
then your right side problems disappear.

170
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,440
That is why you do it. But it goes too far.

171
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,960
The right side problems are, if they are cured,

172
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,440
you get the left side problems which are much more dangerous.

173
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,800
l told you all kinds of psychosomatic diseases,

174
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,200
l don't want to give the list to frighten you,

175
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,280
but they all come from the left side.

176
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:48,000
Now, because the right side is a sort of completely

177
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,040
cured, as they say, people think that it is a very good idea

178
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,360
to get possessed by some spirit.

179
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,440
So these false gurus, what they do,

180
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:07,640
they master these dead spirits.

181
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,520
How? l mean, they know how to do it;

182
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,200
l need not tell you, you are not going to do it.

183
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,840
And they master it and they tell you that ''You take this name''.

184
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,920
You start taking the name of some sort of a God-knows-what.

185
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,640
They don't tell that you take the name of any incarnation,

186
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,040
but they'll tell you ''Take the name of Ram''.

187
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,440
Ram's name is not taken like that,

188
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,000
it has to be Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, Shri Mataji.

189
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,880
So they never put Shri, they just tell you ''Take these names'',

190
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,160
and by these names what happens is that you go

191
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,160
to the left side because of these dead spirits, they capture you.

192
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,960
There are dead spirits on the left side

193
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,920
and there are dead spirits on the right side.

194
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,400
lf they are on the right side they are very ambitious people,

195
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,720
and they try to capture you. It is a very

196
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,240
frightening explanation of the whole thing.

197
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,360
Once they capture you, if you go to the right side,

198
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,840
you get all right side ''qualities'', you are not normal.

199
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,400
Sometimes you feel you are going in the air somewhere,

200
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,960
you have seen something which you would normally not see.

201
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,240
Like two Americans came to see me and they were journalists.

202
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,560
So l asked them ''Why are you here?''

203
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,800
They said ''Mother, you make us like Harishchandra''.

204
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
There was one fellow called Harishchandra who was a journalist.

205
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,400
l said, ''But, like him?''

206
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,960
Because he used to travel in the air, and he used to get news,

207
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,320
like he would tell, about what is happening in some part

208
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:46,000
some part of Bombay

209
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,760
like we have a Juboo Beach

210
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,000
So one day in the newspaper it came out what happened at Juboo Beach

211
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,920
and his name was there,

212
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,240
the one who is the correspondent was Mr Harishchandra.

213
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,760
So, how did Harishchandra tell you my name?

214
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,960
l cured him, while you want to get into his trouble?

215
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,200
So we want to have this ''astral travel'', Americans,

216
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,760
''For what?'' ''Because we are journalists

217
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,280
and we'll know so much about everything

218
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,920
we want to travel all over''.

219
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,080
l said ''This l don't do''.

220
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,480
lf you are doing astral travel, of course l can reduce it .

221
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,280
So all these gurus had mastered

222
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,920
also this art of astral travel,

223
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,960
controlling some dead spirits who were right sided.

224
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,160
So right sided spirits are very ambitious

225
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,960
and they do all kinds of healings,

226
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,760
and all kinds of predictions,

227
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,000
because they are futuristic.

228
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,320
Sometimes they know, sometimes they don't know.

229
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,240
But it is all coming from a wrong source;

230
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,040
so getting into that trap is not a very good thing.

231
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,800
lf somebody is possessed like that,

232
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,280
then such a person starts doing all kinds of wrong things.

233
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,240
Like it will try to grab your house,

234
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:50,200
to grab your money, to deceive you,

235
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,400
run away with your wife, all kinds of things

236
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,040
which are absolutely wrong.

237
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:03,200
Because the influence of the right side increases with it.

238
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,600
Also there are some drugs, when you take them,

239
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,800
like LSD and all that,

240
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,920
you go to the right side and then you start seeing colours,

241
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,120
and people think it is a very great thing to see colours,

242
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,160
because normally you don't see colours.

243
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,520
They don't know basically what is wrong with them.

244
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,080
But basically what is wrong with them is that

245
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,400
there is a bhoot, there is some sort of a ghost

246
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,800
which is very right sided, has gone into their being

247
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,080
and trying to work it out.

248
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,200
But the left side bhoots are different then.

249
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,960
They are sly and they teach you peevish things.

250
00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:00,680
They may also try to entice you

251
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,400
to such an extent that a person can tell lies to any limit.

252
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,840
He tells lies, then he tries to secretly take away your money,

253
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,800
take away whatever you have,

254
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,760
all kinds of planning secretive takes place,

255
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,200
nothing is open,

256
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,280
and you do it without even understanding.

257
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,880
But all these people are more interested

258
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,880
in achieving some sort of a very material advancement,

259
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,240
whether it is on the right side or the left side.

260
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,240
Many things happen like fundamentalism.

261
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,520
lf you are a fundamentalist then these bhoots take over

262
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,040
and they try to overpower you.

263
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,360
They try to teach you how to

264
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:07,160
kill people who do not belong to your religion or to your sect.

265
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,080
They give ideas and they fight and they quarrel and they kill.

266
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,480
But the Mother Earth

267
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,120
or the sea, anything,

268
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,120
any one of these elements can work out the destruction.

269
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,440
Ln such places you'll find

270
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,160
big earthquakes taking place and destroying them.

271
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,200
Or there could be a hurricane that will come and destroy them.

272
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,960
Of course some innocent people are also killed with them.

273
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,320
It could be anything that you do wrong,

274
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,280
it is being corrected by all these five elements.

275
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,640
Ln lndia we had a place called as Latur

276
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,960
where people used to drink and drink and drink.

277
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,320
Once they went for drinking

278
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,480
when they had immersed the statue of Shri Ganesha.

279
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:30,680
That we do, we put it in the sea,

280
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,080
after three days, maybe seven days or ten days.

281
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,280
And they came back from there,

282
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,920
and they had gone for drinking after that

283
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,240
and they were completely drunk

284
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,840
and still they were singing the praise of Shri Ganesh

285
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,200
and saying all kinds of filthy things,

286
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,080
unholy things, dirty things, we can call them

287
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,200
or lots of abuses they were using.

288
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Fulfilling that desire to be nasty, to be bad.

289
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,720
And suddenly an earthquake came.

290
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,360
They were all dancing, and they all went inside

291
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,280
the Mother Earth and were finished.

292
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,720
We had a center there, surprisingly, that center was not touched.

293
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:35,240
About 100 yards away there was a round circle created

294
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,280
so nobody could go out, and they were amazed how is it

295
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,040
that this center has not been touched at all.

296
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,800
That's the power of the goddess.

297
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,280
At the same time,

298
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,440
when she sees these negative people are coming

299
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,280
to torture or to trouble,

300
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,200
it's the goddess who saves the right type of people.

301
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,160
As you know, normally always, if there is one good person,

302
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,080
there will be a hundred bad people getting after them.

303
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,360
And that person feels so lost,

304
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,440
but then the goddess helps that man,

305
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,480
and saves that one, or that human being,

306
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,800
from the troubles from the negative force.

307
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,000
So this mother of yours fights

308
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,160
all kinds of negative forces.

309
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:50,160
They can be, as l told you, drunkards who drink.

310
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
So she starts destroying.

311
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,080
At a lower level she'll destroy their liver,

312
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,800
at an even greater level she'll destroy their family,

313
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,880
she'll destroy their money.

314
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,960
l've not heard of anywhere a statue erected of a drunkard, never.

315
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,200
Nowhere where drinking is a fashion,

316
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,840
where drinking is a daily worship in a way,

317
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,760
but l have never seen anywhere.

318
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,560
How is it that nobody has erected

319
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,720
any statue of a man who was drunk?

320
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,200
It would be nice to show that, but no.

321
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,680
Because the wisdom prevails and people understand

322
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,000
what is the destructive force.

323
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,720
So, one can get possessed by any such idea.

324
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,680
See, like Hitler,

325
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,920
he got the idea that he is the monarch of everything,

326
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,240
and he has every right to destroy the Jews.

327
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,520
And he was destroying; he destroyed so many people.

328
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,360
But, what happened at the end?

329
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,760
He was using the swastika which is the symbol of Shri Ganesh,

330
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:37,440
and with that he was fighting. But luckily it so happened

331
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,320
that the Mother entered into his mind.

332
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,920
By that he lost Bhranti,

333
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,040
illusions, he lost the power of Ganesha, how to use it.

334
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:58,080
And he was using a stencil, and because of the stencil

335
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:05,720
the second, l should say, printing of the Swastika

336
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,880
was the other way round which was for destruction.

337
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,160
So he printed the other kind of swastika.

338
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,480
As a result he got destroyed.

339
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,880
So this is the Bhranti part.

340
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,080
That she enters into your mind and puts you into a Bhranti,

341
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,680
means into an illusion. You commit mistakes.

342
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,440
lf it had not happened

343
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,640
so many people would have been finished by now.

344
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,440
So she enters into the mind of such people

345
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,480
for trying to destroy human beings,

346
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,840
for trying to destroy anything,

347
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,840
and puts ideas in such a manner that they die

348
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,840
or they get self-destruction.

349
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,400
That is why it is written that she is a Bhranti within us.

350
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,520
She creates such an illusion within us that,

351
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,400
that a person who tries to be harmful, to be troublesome,

352
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,800
to be destructive, gets destroyed.

353
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,320
All kinds of things she can put,

354
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,080
and that's how so many people have survived in this world,

355
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,880
otherwise so many would have been finished

356
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,280
and there would have been the kingdom of the Satan.

357
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,960
But it's this goddess is the one who saves us.

358
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:38,080
Symbolically they have said that she has killed so many demons.

359
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,440
Actually she has,

360
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,920
it is not that she has killed them in a symbolic way.

361
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,200
There were demons and demons and even today we have demonic people.

362
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,880
And all of them

363
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,200
will not only be killed but will be finished forever.

364
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,000
l have seen in Russia, l have seen in many countries,

365
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,240
those people once upon a time were regarded as Gods has finished.

366
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,840
It happens in every country.

367
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,840
Wherever there are wrong type of people, they're exposed

368
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,840
and people don't even want to look at their photographs.

369
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,560
They have thrown away their statues.

370
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,080
All this happens because this goddess is the one

371
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,360
who creates an illusion for people.

372
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,800
Now supposing there is a person who is very demonic,

373
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,200
who is going to destroy everyone.

374
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,400
Then the people who are wise will understand,

375
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:48,160
but those who are not, will take to her and get destroyed with him.

376
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,200
Like this thousands of people have been destroyed.

377
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Because they didn't see the right point.

378
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,400
They couldn't understand what is right and what is wrong.

379
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,880
So this idea of right and wrong also

380
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,680
is completely confused by her

381
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,160
so that those who are wrong type can be destroyed.

382
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,160
We don't want them on this earth.

383
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,720
Those who are troublesome,

384
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,240
who are destructive, who are argumentative, will be all destroyed.

385
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,880
But by themselves only they will be destroyed.

386
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,320
It is not necessary for the goddess to do that.

387
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,840
So this is the one which many people ask me,

388
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,080
Why it is said that Bhranti Rupena Samstita?

389
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Why does she exist as an illusion?.

390
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:47,320
This is the reason that your discriminating power is challenged.

391
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,280
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, a real Sahaja Yogi,

392
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,240
then you can feel on your fingertips

393
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,880
if the person whom you are following

394
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,440
is a good man or a bad man.

395
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:06,840
And then you can tell others also that don't

396
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,000
So many seekers are destroyed like that.

397
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,920
Wrong type of gurus came, and they just followed them.

398
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,760
Stupid, they were absolutely stupid gurus,

399
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,960
and these were stupid people,

400
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,920
l don't know why they followed them. It was so obvious

401
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,320
that they were just after some sort of a Rolls Royce or something.

402
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,560
l have seen them,

403
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,200
so mad that they can't get out of it.

404
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,480
There are people now who are following all kinds of wrong gurus;

405
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:52,320
one of them is now very much liked by the lndians all over

406
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,520
when they are abroad, not in lndia so much.

407
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,080
So they follow that Babaji, all right.

408
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,080
And this Babaji is the one,

409
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,240
he takes money, he steals money,

410
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,240
he steals ornaments, he does all kinds of things.

411
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,840
But they don't mind. Whatever he is doing is all right.

412
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,040
And this Babaji is the one, is to be destroyed.

413
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,800
But the advantage of having this Babaji is this,

414
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,120
that you have all kinds of stupid people on this earth,

415
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:35,080
so they have no discrimination,

416
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,160
and they fall prey to these Babajis finished.

417
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,080
They'll get heart attacks, they'll become blind, they'll get cancer,

418
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,640
they'll get all kinds of troubles and that destroys them.

419
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,840
But it is surprising, human beings are such

420
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,280
that they see a person being destroyed by a Babaji,

421
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,000
or some guruji lady,

422
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,360
and still one is killed and this also goes forward .

423
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,480
It is something surprising, that human beings don't see

424
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,200
that the person is destroyed.

425
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,360
Like l have told you many a time since,

426
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,080
people who are going to the pub,

427
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,400
they see from the pub people coming out and falling on the ground.

428
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,160
And they queue up to go inside again, to come back and fall.

429
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,720
It is very surprising, isn't it?, they have no brains.

430
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,600
Why do they want to go to the pub?

431
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,960
lf they have seen already somebody falling down.

432
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,840
But they do it.

433
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,640
Now this is the Last Judgement, as l told you,

434
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,200
and at this time

435
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,760
you have to see what's happening to the person

436
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,360
who has gone by wrong methods

437
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,000
or by the help of some of these gurujis.

438
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,200
It is very clear, if you want to see it, very clear.

439
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,560
How they are destroying themselves.

440
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,080
''ln any case'', they say, ''ln any case we have to die,

441
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,880
so why not go to the pub?'' l mean, what's this?

442
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,560
This kind of argument they give, so stupid

443
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,280
as if they have no brains, no intelligence

444
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,440
to understand that a person has gone

445
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,480
and he came back from there and he has fallen on the ground,

446
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,880
and nobody to pick him up.

447
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,880
And they are doing it.

448
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,800
And they said that Christ did it, that he gave wine to people.

449
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,160
Now, no, he cannot, he is perfect.

450
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,840
He didn't give wine, he gave them

451
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:53,080
just an ordinary juice of the grapes.

452
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,920
How can you make wine in one second, can you?

453
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,200
But that's how they explain it;

454
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:06,320
all their bad things are explained by their stupid intelligence

455
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,080
and they go for destruction.

456
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,240
And now in Kali Yuga

457
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,240
destruction is working very fast.

458
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,200
Why? Because people have lost their discrimination.

459
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,320
They are no more discreet,

460
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,360
and so many people have lost it, it's not few.

461
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,640
And it is a fashion to become indiscreet.

462
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,880
l said, ''Why are they doing like this?''

463
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,240
''Mother, this is a fashion''.

464
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,720
Any stupid thing is a fashion.

465
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,240
Now you take to that stupid thing and then you are in trouble.

466
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,920
Nowadays of course there's a fashion that women,

467
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,160
especially in America l have seen,

468
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:10,040
they want to wear just straps over their

469
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,720
frocks, whatever you may call it.

470
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,800
Just straps, and both the chakras are left open.

471
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,680
They're very important chakras,

472
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,800
you should not even wear sleeveless,

473
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,800
they should be always covered.

474
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
All other chakras we cover, except for Agnya

475
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,160
which we also cover with kumkum.

476
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,040
By that, how many diseases can come. You can get sinus,

477
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,400
start from sinus, you can get eye trouble,

478
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,800
you can get paralysis of both the hands.

479
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,840
You can get also Parkinson.

480
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,240
All sorts of diseases can come

481
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,600
because these are two very important chakras,

482
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,320
one is the Sri Chakra, which is on the right side

483
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,240
and another is the Laleeta Chakra on the left-hand side.

484
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,480
You should never, never expose these chakras, also the knees.

485
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,200
But it is a fashion nowadays to show the knees, l don't know,

486
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,080
l can't understand the logic behind it.

487
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,920
What is in the knees?

488
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,040
Why people want to see the knees of people?

489
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,320
l mean l just don't understand.

490
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,840
There's no logic, it's senseless!

491
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,000
At first l never understood it,

492
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,800
and now l have understood that they want to attract men!

493
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,200
lf men are attracted by your knees,

494
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,000
what sort of men they must be?

495
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,080
l don't understand such men also.

496
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,280
Men will be fully dressed while women will expose both the Nabhis

497
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:55,400
and both the chakras which are so important.

498
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,200
And that is the fashion!.

499
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,760
Tomorrow the fashion will start that you shave your heads.

500
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,640
So everybody will shave.

501
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,800
As if it's like a flock of sheep

502
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,240
who don't understand, they go by the collective happening.

503
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,200
So there's a fashion which is actually collective.

504
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,680
And that's how it finishes off their sense, completely.

505
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,200
You see it every day and you don't understand.

506
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,680
l have seen even lndian women who are abroad,

507
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,200
they also try to copy the fashions.

508
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,880
And they also expose both their chakras,

509
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,040
and then they get into troubles.

510
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,240
It's very surprising.

511
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,120
At least in lndia it's not regarded as a

512
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,480
good men to see a woman like that.

513
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,040
But when they have come abroad they have learnt this

514
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,400
a great knowledge how to expose your body.

515
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,840
The other side of it could be even more serious,

516
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,360
like you cover your face.

517
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,040
Mohamed-Saab must have thought of the modern times

518
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,680
and said, ''Cover your face.

519
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,800
Cover your body. Cover yourself completely,

520
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
so that you are safe as a woman and men are safe

521
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,040
because they are not attracted''.

522
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,440
l mean this is going to the extremes.

523
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,800
And it was to be worked out that way. But it does not.

524
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,200
l have seen also Muslim women are so stupid

525
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,320
when they are facing their husbands,

526
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,840
the way they behave to attract their husbands,

527
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,920
and the way the husbands try to dominate. It is too much!

528
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,840
So this is the Bhranti.

529
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,800
The Bhranti created by the Mother, the Amba.

530
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,640
She creates this Bhranti

531
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,160
and with this Bhranti l have seen people can go amok

532
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,400
and they don't know they are going amok,

533
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,120
because all of them are going that side. So what?

534
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,680
Like there's a story

535
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,800
about a father told his son

536
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,120
that ''Which ever way people go, you must follow them''.

537
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,040
So he saw many people going and he followed them.

538
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,920
Where does he go? To a funeral!

539
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,360
That doesn't mean don't use your brains!

540
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,160
This is said of course.

541
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,800
Also you will see what they do is this,

542
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:42,760
that say many people are going, say,

543
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,280
to something wrong,

544
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,880
they have no brains of their own, no individuality, nothing,

545
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,360
they just follow it. They don't see what they have achieved,

546
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,920
what have they got, what is the use, nothing.

547
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:03,040
Even when you buy something you want to find out

548
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,800
what is the quality; the person who has purchased,

549
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,400
how is he using, everything you want to find out.

550
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,720
But when it comes to following the fashion, nobody thinks about it.

551
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,280
And the fashion is created to be fool people, also, l think so.

552
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:26,000
It is something very funny

553
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,840
creation of the evil force,

554
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,200
so that human beings should be destroyed.

555
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,280
It is, they say, the designers.

556
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,920
l say it is nothing, designers or anything,

557
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:47,440
but is their aggressive force, their negative force

558
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,000
which works on you;

559
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,280
and who saves you is the Mother on the left side.

560
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,640
She has got seven curtains. Seven boundaries

561
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,080
she doesn't want you to cross over.

562
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,800
But human beings say: ''Why not? Why not me?

563
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,280
lf they have gone to hell, l'll also go to hell''.

564
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:14,160
All right. That's been made already for you, so go ahead.

565
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,400
So that's why she creates the Bhranti;

566
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:23,160
because some people have to go out, out of this circulation,

567
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,840
out of this evolution process. Let them go out.

568
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,720
This is the Last Judgement. All right, that's how you'll be judged,

569
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,920
by your own stupidity you'll be judged.

570
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:42,360
l have told so many Sahaja Yogis something small,

571
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,880
that you must put some oil in the nights

572
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,240
and the morning time you wash.

573
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,920
But they don't do it.

574
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:55,280
But by doing that what happens is that you soothe yourself,

575
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,040
you sleep well.

576
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,080
Oiling is a very good thing. We need it all of us,

577
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,880
especially in this cold weather, we need it.

578
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,280
But they won't put it.

579
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,800
They'll neglect themselves.

580
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,760
Because they think they're Sahaja Yogis

581
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,200
they are protected, Mother can oil them.

582
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,840
It's not so. You have to look after yourself.

583
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:25,560
As far as the body is concerned, the mind is concerned,

584
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,720
you are responsible for your body.

585
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,640
With Sahaja Yoga you will understand what's wrong with you,

586
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,400
what you are doing wrong.

587
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,840
l mean l tell you some things which are very important,

588
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:57,920
but to you they may not be, but you should try that.

589
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,000
As it is you are Realised Souls, your spirit is there,

590
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,840
you can feel the vibrations,

591
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,960
and you can understand what's wrong with the person.

592
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:13,080
Mostly what l have seen, now it is much less,

593
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,480
that people only inform me always about people who are possessed.

594
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,960
''Mother, such and such person is possessed''.

595
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,000
''Mother this person has got this possession''.

596
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,920
l said, ''But, throw them out!'' That's all!

597
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,760
Why do you want me to bother about them?

598
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,920
Just throw them out!

599
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,040
Then after going out of Sahaja Yoga they will realise,

600
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,720
then they will say ''Mother we don't want to go out of Sahaja Yoga''

601
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,840
Why? Because they know that now

602
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,920
they are completely away

603
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,440
from reality and from safety.

604
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,640
So they want to come back.

605
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,120
Those who can come back can come back.

606
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,000
But those who should not come back should never come back.

607
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,280
Because they are so mad that they'll create a fashion of madness,

608
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,080
and people can get influenced by that.

609
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:21,080
So to get influenced by others is not a sign of a Sahaja Yogi.

610
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,640
He can influence others,

611
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:29,960
but how does he get influenced by others but for Sahaja Yoga?

612
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,960
Sahaja Yoga is the discriminating power.

613
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,760
And who has given you this is the Kundalini.

614
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,840
So this Kundalini which is your mother,

615
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,600
the one which is now in your triangular bone, also

616
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,160
gives you all the qualities and all the beauties of your being.

617
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,800
Of course l have told you so many things about

618
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,320
Kundalini that l need not tell you.

619
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:59,240
But she also can correct the left side.

620
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,600
Some people have a habit

621
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,880
of all the time crying and weeping over. l don't know.

622
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,400
Every time you meet them they are in tears:

623
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,800
''And what has happened?''

624
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,160
''Mother this has happened, that has happened'' and all that.

625
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,720
They write letters after letters to me,

626
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,880
telling about their woes, their troubles and this and that.

627
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,280
Baba you are Sahaja Yogis now.

628
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:30,040
Now you are in the Garden of Eden,

629
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,280
you are in the heavens.

630
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,760
And why are they thinking about all the hellish things

631
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,200
which are not important? Why?

632
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,240
Because you haven't got your individuality either.

633
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,880
Now as Sahaja Yogis you have to develop your discrimination

634
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:20,040
of understanding what others are.

635
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,800
Also about yourself.

636
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,040
Why do you hanker after things? Try to understand.

637
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,800
What is so great about it?

638
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,120
Why do you want to do it?

639
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:41,600
Question yourself. ls it some possession?

640
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,000
ls it some fashion?

641
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:51,520
Or is it your individual feeling?

642
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,800
So, l'm trying to tell you

643
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,200
that this left side of yours is so protective,

644
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,280
at the same time

645
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,080
if you are very aggressive about your left side

646
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:14,280
you are thrown from one to another to another to another into hell.

647
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,400
And then you suffer.

648
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,840
So you must understand, your wisdom should be there,

649
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:29,360
which you can develop very much with the help of the left side.

650
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,760
Wisdom can be very well developed.

651
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,880
Now there's somebody, say a Sahaja Yogi, so called,

652
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:46,000
and he is absolutely aggressive, money-oriented, deceitful

653
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,920
and you get into his trap.

654
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,200
ln Hindi we call it Chakkar, Chakkar.

655
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,800
And once you get involved into that you go on drifting;

656
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:09,320
still your left side will protect, up to a point.

657
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:15,240
But if you are too much of it, it throws you ''Get out, get out''.

658
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,000
Now the time has come for all of us to understand

659
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,800
that you are all Sahaja Yogis

660
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,120
and you have a very big responsibility,

661
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,080
very, very big responsibility that you should do

662
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,880
what your enlightened conscience tells you.

663
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:41,160
Take to your enlightenment and live under that light,

664
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,040
and don't jump in the darkness.

665
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,960
And by that you will also understand

666
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,240
who is the right person and who is not the right person.

667
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,480
Even in Sahaja Yoga this negativity can work,

668
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,080
it works.

669
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,440
And one should not get involved

670
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,960
into any negative thoughts of others,

671
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:13,080
or negative doing of others.

672
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,200
It's a warning today l wanted to give you all,

673
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,360
because you people are

674
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:26,520
very much there, to enjoy.

675
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,040
Look after your attention, where does it go.

676
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,760
There is so many beautiful things, see the flowers, so beautiful!.

677
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,880
See this thing they have made so beautifully.

678
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,280
It makes my heart jump with joy;

679
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,280
while some people don't even notice.

680
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,080
The other day l asked somebody,

681
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,960
''Who had made that flower arrangement?'' ''Which flower?''

682
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,000
l said ''The one that was there'' ''Which one?''

683
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:02,040
So l told the names of the flowers. ''We never saw''

684
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,280
Where were you looking,

685
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,280
that you couldn't see the flowers?!

686
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,720
Because your eyes are so stupid

687
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,920
that they cannot see the beauty.

688
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:18,920
They are engulfed with all kinds of negative things.

689
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,920
So the goddess has to kill all the rakshasas.

690
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,080
l don't know how many she has killed, and again they are back.

691
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,280
And again people are being trapped.

692
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,160
This is going on.

693
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,200
So these rakshasas are there and you have to pin-point them.

694
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:47,200
And tell people ''Where are you going? He's a rakshasa.

695
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,080
What he has done, what has he achieved?''

696
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,360
Now you should talk like that;

697
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,360
openly.

698
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:05,120
So you can save many people who are going to these rakshasas,

699
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:11,040
who are coming in such clothes that you cannot make them out.

700
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,920
They will be destroyed, one by one,

701
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,880
but when they are in the heart

702
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:23,040
of so many people how can you destroy them?

703
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,160
So it is for you people to tell them

704
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,880
what these rakshasas are doing.

705
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,240
l know their tricks,

706
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:39,160
but the worst part is that the human beings fall into their tricks.

707
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:44,840
So you have to be very self-understanding.

708
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,000
Ask always the question ''Why?

709
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,960
Why am l attracted to this?

710
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,040
What is the gain?''

711
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,200
Ask yourself this question.

712
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,920
You'll find

713
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,920
that after coming to Sahaja Yoga you have gained so much.

714
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,440
So now, why have this false idea?

715
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:12,760
why go after false things, negative things?

716
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,040
That's what Sahaja Yogis have to do,

717
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,280
because not that they're responsible for others,

718
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,800
they are responsible for themselves also.

719
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,360
Now the sweetest thing said about her is

720
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:32,200
that she gives you Shraddha.

721
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:37,800
Shraddha we can translate it as faith.

722
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:44,400
To have faith, rightly not wrongly.

723
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:50,360
People take full advantage if you have wrong faiths.

724
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:56,640
But faith is very important, that she gives also.

725
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,280
And that's very joy-giving.

726
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,000
The faith is very joy-giving.

727
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:11,800
But when the incarnations lived, nobody believed in them.

728
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:17,040
They had no faith in them. Christ, they crucified,

729
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:21,480
nobody stood up to say, ''Why are you crucifying him?''

730
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:27,720
All of them; nobody could have

731
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,920
that faith to stand up.

732
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,840
They may fight for their own country,

733
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,280
they may fight for their religion or own nonsense,

734
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,840
but, ''That a man, this man, is really the Truth,

735
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:47,680
he is the one who is an incarnation'', nobody will say it.

736
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,400
So yesterday l was stunned

737
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,840
to see the drama they have shown.

738
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,000
l mean, l couldn't face myself, l should say.

739
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,280
Though it's the Truth, of course, l agree.

740
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,880
But l couldn't face myself.

741
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:10,000
l am too humble to accept such a thing,

742
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:16,080
and it's very ingenious, it's very great to create such a drama

743
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:21,280
and of all the things. At first l had said that

744
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,760
the English have such a sense of drama,

745
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,280
they had people like Shakespeare and all that,

746
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,280
and the way they were producing drama l couldn't understand.

747
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,960
But this one was the last word on perfection.

748
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,880
So much so that l couldn't say a word about it.

749
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,920
l was just stunned.

750
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,000
The Truth that they have propounded.

751
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,440
But in my lifetime

752
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,880
you will have no doubts, if you have some sense in you.

753
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,040
Because so many miracles are taking place.

754
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,280
Today only somebody told me:

755
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,280
''Somebody had cancer,

756
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,800
ulcer and all kinds of things,

757
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,800
and after Sahaja Yoga she went to the hospital and she had nothing''.

758
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,800
All such miracles are taking place. Leave alone.

759
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,120
Also there are never have happened like this

760
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:31,280
that there are photographs of mine

761
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,080
where you see, is remarkable.

762
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,000
Even the scientists are surprised at it,

763
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,280
how these photographs are coming.

764
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:48,000
Actually there was Shri Ganesha standing behind it actually.

765
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,960
Only in one camera it came.

766
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,320
It is just for you people to have faith.

767
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,760
Because when the person is not there,

768
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,280
like Christ is no more, now everybody's going to church.

769
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,920
Shri Rama is not there so they are all singing his praise.

770
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:11,280
Shri Krishna is not there so they are ''Hari Rama, Hari Krishna''.

771
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,880
So when there is Sakshat, when that is before you,

772
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,280
you don't accept.

773
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:23,280
Because perhaps you don't believe you can deserve it, perhaps.

774
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,960
Or may be it is,

775
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,880
l don't know, human beings it is very difficult to understand them.

776
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,000
When you are standing before them they don't believe.

777
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,280
When you are no more, then they will believe.

778
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,280
It is a very funny thing, isn't it?

779
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:40,800
All through out if you see the history of spirituality

780
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,920
this has been going on.

781
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,320
Gyanadeva showed some miracles, still

782
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,360
only the wise, only the sensible

783
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,960
could understand and believe it.

784
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,200
And there is so few that as a result

785
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,440
such people are crucified, killed or done anything.

786
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,440
They have tried that with me,

787
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,120
but you know in this life l have come in all Forms,

788
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,000
and nobody can destroy me:

789
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:22,080
Unless and until l want to finish myself, no one can.

790
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:27,680
The powers are of love, affection, compassion,

791
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,080
but also there's a power

792
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,240
which completely corrects other people.

793
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,880
So

794
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,600
to you people not to have faith in Sahaja Yoga

795
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,200
shows complete blankness,

796
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,080
you have seen the photographs,

797
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,080
you have seen everything, you have known the miracles,

798
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,000
it has happened to you. You have the experience of Sahaja Yoga.

799
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,400
Despite that your faith is so weak.

800
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,080
She's the one who gives you faith,

801
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,880
so you have to praise her, you have to fall at her feet,

802
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,200
you have to worship her and ask her

803
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,280
''Oh Mother, give us that faith''.

804
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,920
And with this faith you'll be amazed,

805
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,360
any person who has this kind of a faith,

806
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,440
he tells me ''Mother, please, do this''

807
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,240
It happens. It just happens.

808
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:34,280
Such right they have got to ask for anything. It works out.

809
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:38,000
But first your faith should be solid.

810
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,000
Faith should be real.

811
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:45,720
lf it is real and if it is deep,

812
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,280
you can achieve whatever you want.

813
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,040
Not wrong, but good things.

814
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,800
And so try to develop that faith

815
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,920
and as a faith gives you such joy and happiness,

816
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:04,760
you get committed, you get involved,

817
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,280
and you don't want to get out of it.

818
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:12,360
So the greatest thing is the blessing

819
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,880
of the left side is the faith.

820
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,840
Faith which is pure,

821
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:25,960
faith can be translated as, we can say, Vishwas

822
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,240
but not. Faith is Shraddha.

823
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:36,160
Shraddha means something that is within;

824
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,040
which has no doubts,

825
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,800
which has no doing as such, it is just there.

826
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,280
So you should now develop faith

827
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,680
about yourself and about Sahaja Yoga.

828
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:57,040
lf your faith is strong you will see many miracles also.

829
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,400
But with miracles, with everything,

830
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,440
still if you don't understand

831
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:08,960
then it is your discretion.

832
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:16,000
May God Bless You.
