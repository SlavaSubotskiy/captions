1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,260
SM: Yeah, that’s a good idea.

2
00:00:01,461 --> 00:00:03,061
SY: O.k.

3
00:00:03,262 --> 00:00:05,039
SM: But you should have some accompaniment.

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,440
There are people who can help. SY: Maybe that fellow...

5
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:09,409
Somebody brought a

6
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,461
guitar? Somebody will brought a guitar?

7
00:00:11,662 --> 00:00:14,300
SY: [Ethian] you brought a guitar, right?

8
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:16,134
SY: I think she should stand up and and do it because...

9
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,753
SY: Stand up!
SM: What you said?

10
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,180
It will be better, isn't?

11
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,920
Somebody should accompany her.  SY: She is going to sing English songs.

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,960
Can you, can you not give her? SM: Come along!

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,480
SY: No, I don't know, I mean how many... Maybe Antonio or Steve can play with.

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,920
SM: Antonio, where is he?

15
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:34,180
Come along, bring your guitar, come along.

16
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:38,575
SY: I, I don't have. It's actually his guitar at the moment.

17
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:42,604
SM: Can you lend him your guitar?

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,140
SY: No problem. The problem solved.

19
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,600
Come along.

20
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,600
SY: Would you like the piano?

21
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:01,978
SM: Just to hold the tune!

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,894
[hindhi/marathi]

23
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:06,914
SM: Just, just to hold the...

24
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:09,678
You need not play if you just hold the... [unclear]

25
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,686
SY: You will.

26
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:15,473
SM: Alright?
SY: You will get the vibrations.

27
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:19,973
Very good.

28
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:22,951
SY: So, I guess I'll just start….

29
00:01:23,152 --> 00:01:25,456
and you can just come in whenever you want.

30
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:28,254
SM: You best put your [glasses].
SY: Oh, that's nice!

31
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,436
SM: Is it alright?
SY: I think so.

32
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,917
SY: This song is called "What is the power of heart" and...

33
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,567
[unclear] there is still one more verse that it has to be inspired but I was...

34
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:53,018
inspired by actually [a widow]...

35
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,712
SM: It's alright. SY: So, I'll just start.

36
00:04:43,462 --> 00:04:48,247
Oh, so, the next one is called,

37
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,135
this one is called "Lovers and neighbors and Mary's best friends"

38
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,384
and I don't really want to say what this mean,

39
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,313
except that it is a little bit too in the experimental stage.

40
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,882
SM: What have you been doing in Boston,

41
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,901
with your music? Let’s have something from the Boston people.

42
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,794
SY: Well...

43
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:54,885
we haven't prepared anything yet, Mother.

44
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:59,114
SY: He hasn't prepared anything yet.

45
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:01,043
SY: From Santa Cruz, Mother,

46
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:06,553
Doug Nicely, whom you have met, has written

47
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:08,676
a few songs, for you.

48
00:08:08,877 --> 00:08:12,698
and he would love to come and sing himself.

49
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:14,721
And the next best thing was taping.

50
00:08:14,922 --> 00:08:17,911
SY: I don't know if we a have good enough tape for play this to you.

51
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:25,345
Exceptional this song - the first one - is the song about Realization,

52
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:28,458
how he got his Realization, sort of romance,

53
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:29,987
but still the essence is there;

54
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:32,690
and it's... and the next one is a devotional song,

55
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:35,311
and there's no words we can express.

56
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:40,123
And the other one is a song written by Michael [Teashek]

57
00:08:40,324 --> 00:08:42,482
who is too shy to sing it,

58
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:45,123
but he would sing it occasionally to Sahaja yogis,

59
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:49,649
and so Doug can nicely sing it,

60
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,545
exactly the way that Michael would sang it.

61
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:55,594
So we can get a table for him and play this.

62
00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:58,432
And the other side, he wrote a song

63
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:01,011
about the Devi, is like in Mahabharata

64
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:03,124
the battle of good and evil

65
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:06,312
and he wrote this just before he got his Realization.

66
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:09,074
And in this, the battle between good and evils

67
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:11,424
was a huge slaughter

68
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,561
and evil conquered good.

69
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,761
When he got his Self-Realization, he knew it is wrong,

70
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:22,871
he rewrote the end, added one more verse, one more verse.

71
00:09:25,382 --> 00:09:26,421
SM: Should we hear that?

72
00:09:26,622 --> 00:09:29,660
SY: Which side, Mother?

73
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,615
SM: Let's have before and after.

74
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,147
SM: Are you alright, Doug?

75
00:09:45,348 --> 00:09:47,332
SY - Yes, thank you, yes, Mother.

76
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:52,292
SM: I would like to, I would like to meet all the

77
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:57,247
new Sahaja yogis who have come from New York or from Boston,

78
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:03,900
in My room tomorrow morning, all right?

79
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,060
SY: Mataji, the speakers are only in this room,

80
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,720
so we open the doors, so you can hear it. Very fast.

81
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,340
SM: What he is said?

82
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:31,141
SY: He said that the speakers were in that room, Mother,

83
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:34,053
so they play it, they have to play it from in there but,

84
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:37,720
they'll open the doors, so you can hear it.

85
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:39,246
SM: About videos?

86
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:42,326
SY: The voice will come in from that room to this room.

87
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:44,715
SM: Why?
SY: Because the speakers are there.

88
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,200
SM: How could they done [unclear]

89
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,813
SY: [unclear] can.

90
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,360
SM: [unclear].

91
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,500
You see, for breakfast we can have it. [unclear].

92
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,980
We'll have it tomorrow at lunch then,

93
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,235
we'll all be sitting here.

94
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,436
SY: Yes, yes.

95
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,681
SM: That would be better.

96
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:21,619
SM: So let's have something from Boston!

97
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,968
SY: Yeah, yeah. Come on Michael!

98
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:26,927
SM: I said tomorrow we can hear.

99
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:29,678
SY: Seems to be that way, Mother.

100
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:32,571
SM: After lunch. SY - We come here again together.

101
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:34,886
SM: Take this [unclear].

102
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:38,310
SY: All right, I'll just be, have to be very spontaneous.

103
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:40,932
SM: Better.

104
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,338
SM: You want somebody else to join you?

105
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:50,936
SY: Well, Christine had a flute. That will be good, I think.

106
00:11:51,137 --> 00:11:52,177
SM: Christine come along.

107
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,595
SY: Mother, I didn't bring it.

108
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:57,185
I didn't bring my instrument.

109
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,757
SM: What is here?

110
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,617
[You all are good]. You are all going to sing, all right?

111
00:12:08,818 --> 00:12:11,058
SY: We can do the whole...

112
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:14,374
"He's got the hole world in...", "She's got the hole world in Her..."

113
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:19,369
SM: Come along with it. What is it?

114
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,909
SY: That one that they sang for you in New York, Mother: "She's got the whole world...

115
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,909
SM: Yes, all of you, come along, join them.

116
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,970
Hello, come here! All of you. Come along!

117
00:12:32,274 --> 00:12:34,231
Sit down.

118
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,522
Come, come!

119
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:57,045
Call all the children!

120
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,474
Where are they gone?

121
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:19,942
SY: Oh yes, Christine, you should sing, too.

122
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,724
SM: Which one? [Poppin?]

123
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:26,651
SY: No, Christine.

124
00:13:26,852 --> 00:13:29,899
Come up here Christine, come on! SM: Come along, come along!

125
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:40,480
Where is My purse?

126
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:43,675
SY: Christine has it.
SM: No, no, this you have it I think.

127
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:46,924
Smaller one, please. I just need my handkerchief.

128
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,607
Yes!

129
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:08,540
Gregoire is going to sing.

130
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:24,223
SY: Too high?

131
00:14:24,424 --> 00:14:26,760
SM: Natany you also sing?
SY: Oh, yes.

132
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:31,844
SM: You represent the whole of Italy here, you know?

133
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:36,363
No italian has come, so you are the one

134
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:38,805
representing the whole of Italy.

135
00:14:42,093 --> 00:14:44,260
Ruth has written a letter of great apologies

136
00:14:44,461 --> 00:14:46,228
that she's the one who could not come,

137
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:49,044
from Italy, so now we have [Sawan].

138
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,321
Loudspeaker you can connect. It's better?

139
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:40,788
SM: Beautiful.

140
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:42,230
Beautiful.

141
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:45,478
Now which one you know, the another one?

142
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:49,035
SY: [You are the Lord].
SM: No?

143
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,137
SY: Shri Mataji, [Gondhari].
SM: Jerusalem.

144
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:52,507
SY: Herman is there. SM: Who?

145
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,533
Herman, Herman
SM: Da..

146
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,006
Herman.

147
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:05,616
He's, he's a soprano?

148
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:09,930
SY: Now, is same, same this wants to be for you the other day...

149
00:18:11,494 --> 00:18:15,150
SM: [unclear]?

150
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:52,761
SM: It's all right, you stay here. SY: I don't want.

151
00:18:52,962 --> 00:18:54,977
[Send the car].

152
00:19:03,244 --> 00:19:05,958
May God bless you!

153
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:29,948
SY: Are you ready with it?

154
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:32,547
SY: Can, can hear it?

155
00:19:32,748 --> 00:19:34,466
SY: O.k.

156
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:40,526
SY: If not, maybe at near by the court.

157
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:42,233
SY: Yeah.

158
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:17,104
SY: Why don't you ask Antonio play the cord?

159
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:20,227
I think you may be able to play the cord and, and keep the rhythm.

160
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:22,992
Why don't you go over with the song?

161
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,666
SM - [unclear] It's good.

162
00:21:38,126 --> 00:21:39,785
[unclear] your breathing?

163
00:22:07,338 --> 00:22:09,002
So hold your breathe after that. [unclear]...

164
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:12,236
Hold your breathe [unclear].

165
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:48,289
Better now?

166
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:53,635
Better?

167
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,251
SM: Very good voice. Now, who else?

168
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:53,260
SY: Nancy, Nancy is the singer in next song.

169
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,932
SM: Nancy, are you?
SY: Yes.

170
00:25:58,133 --> 00:26:01,074
SM: All right, come along, let's have it.

171
00:26:01,275 --> 00:26:04,215
SY: We all have [prepared]. We in the ashram

172
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,749

173
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,170
SM: All right.
SY: song.

174
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,800
Prepared somewhat for You.

175
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,840
SM: Thank you very much for playing the piano so well.

176
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,900
Mother, we'd like to sing a song

177
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:35,110
which I think a lot of people probably know

178
00:26:35,311 --> 00:26:38,687
so they should joint in, because we probably don't know it so well.

179
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,055
SM: All right.

180
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,571
SY: We could, we could sing

181
00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:45,849
Oh, when the saints go marching in, after all.

182
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:54,211
SM: [unclear].

183
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,092
SY: Well, this will do, anyway.

184
00:26:56,293 --> 00:26:59,029
SM: That one from William Blake?

185
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,470
Jerusalem.

186
00:27:25,356 --> 00:27:27,076
Vivid you also sing?

187
00:27:27,277 --> 00:27:29,303
Come along, join them.

188
00:27:29,504 --> 00:27:30,663
Come along.

189
00:27:30,864 --> 00:27:33,212
Christine is very good. Christine has a good voice.

190
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,920
Christine, come along. She has a very beautiful... After Realization

191
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,180
her voice became so melodious [unclear].

192
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,360
Otherwise she was... no good.

193
00:27:47,863 --> 00:27:50,350
That's a fact.

194
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:55,861
What about you, [Fritz]? Play that.

195
00:27:56,062 --> 00:27:57,674
SY: Mother, I will do...

196
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:00,802
SM: Why not try? Yes, try.

197
00:28:01,003 --> 00:28:04,301
You must play in My presence so you'll play very well later on.

198
00:28:04,502 --> 00:28:07,072
All right? That's a promise.

199
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,938
That's a promise to you also.

200
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:32,736
SY: We could sing the song of fewer words...

201
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:54,278
SM: What about... Esther, you also sing.

202
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:57,037
All of you who sing should come forward.

203
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:54,141
SY: Do you know the song, "You are my Father, You are my Mother?

204
00:31:54,342 --> 00:31:58,111
SY: No, sorry.

205

00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,985
You are my God, You are my friend, [unclear]

207
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,823
SY: That's it!

208
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,702
SY : Nancy has a song, Mother.

209
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:58,755
SY: I don't want to play...

210
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:01,238
This is from...

211
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:06,831
a play that started years ago. It's called...

212
00:36:08,527 --> 00:36:09,527
God's spell.

213
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,942
SY: God's spell.

214
00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:15,012
SY: God's spell.

215
00:36:15,213 --> 00:36:17,113
SY: You probably have renamed it Nirmala.

216
00:36:17,314 --> 00:36:18,315
It's a musical...

217
00:36:18,516 --> 00:36:21,188
SY: God's spell. The spell of God.

218
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:23,034

219
00:36:23,235 --> 00:36:24,304

222
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,110
No?

223
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,228
Which other song you know?

224
00:39:10,444 --> 00:39:14,481
Your father is a great singer. What about you having another song?

225
00:39:14,682 --> 00:39:15,682
C: I don't know.

226
00:39:15,883 --> 00:39:19,136
SM: Don't know any? Your father didn't teach you any song?

227
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:28,292
Now, wich one now?

228
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:31,461

SY: Yeah. Can you play Ni, Pa, Sa, Re, Sa, Sa.

00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:02,864
SM: Do the first note - you play...

[hindhi/marathi].

00:42:14,914 --> 00:42:16,223
[hindhi/marathi].

00:42:16,424 --> 00:42:17,787
Let's play the first note.

SY: So we are going to try, o.k.?

280
00:42:54,583 --> 00:42:57,731
So the combination of notes is known as Yaman

281
00:42:57,932 --> 00:43:00,524
and as called... SM: Melody.

282
00:43:00,725 --> 00:43:02,604
The name of the melody is Yaman.

00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:11,649
So, rather late, but doesn't matter.

287
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,168
SY: Right.

288
00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:14,376
SY: Maybe L.A. time.

289
00:43:14,577 --> 00:43:16,388
SM: Composition it is a Ganesha Stuti,

290
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:18,665
because that's why we can play it any time.

291

SY: Right... For the Lord Ganesha.

292
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,420

00:45:38,806 --> 00:45:40,631
SY: Would you sing to us?

298
00:45:55,412 --> 00:45:57,512
even don't sing.

00:46:07,991 --> 00:46:09,795
SM: At this time Malkauns is the right.

304

This is raaga is used also in Japan, I found with five notes,

I mean we have any

367

372
00:52:21,656 --> 00:52:24,539
On this raga there is a very nice bhajan.

373
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,759

378
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,183
of the Nath, means the primordial master,

379
00:56:55,384 --> 00:56:59,105
is dancing Shri Krishna.

380
00:56:59,928 --> 00:57:01,766
Pandurang is Shri Krishna

381
00:57:01,967 --> 00:57:04,954
and how can we, the...

382
00:57:05,565 --> 00:57:09,792
simple people entering inside the house,

383
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:12,261

387
00:57:23,504 --> 00:57:26,374
Threshold, on the threshold of the house.

388
00:57:26,575 --> 00:57:28,176
We just get so detached,

389
00:57:28,377 --> 00:57:30,840
that we start dancing there at the threshold only,

390
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:33,395
because we are...

391
00:57:33,596 --> 00:57:35,707
not able to see them.

392
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,800

393
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,760
[hindhi/marathi].

394
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,420
SM: And the another one is that you know there is

395
00:57:44,626 --> 00:57:46,343
Nira river, where I have

396
00:57:46,544 --> 00:57:48,536
taken the land for you, people,

397
00:57:48,737 --> 00:57:50,507
that meets the Bhima river,

398
00:57:50,731 --> 00:57:55,080
and both have them join together become Chandrabhaga.

399
00:57:55,281 --> 00:57:59,967
And then they go, and then they go to,

400
00:58:00,168 --> 00:58:02,671
Chandrabhaga goes to Pandharpur

401
00:58:02,872 --> 00:58:05,570
and at Pandharpur... Yes!

402
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:12,762
And at Pandharpur

403
00:58:12,963 --> 00:58:15,073
this people join and sing this song.

404
00:58:15,274 --> 00:58:17,743
So they are saying that at that river,

405
00:58:17,944 --> 00:58:20,133
we take our bath,

406
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:22,738
when the dance is on, we are taking our bath,

407
00:58:22,939 --> 00:58:24,706
and we are singing and enjoying ourselves

408
00:58:24,907 --> 00:58:28,374
when the dance is on in the house of the Primordial Master.

409
00:58:28,575 --> 00:58:31,567
Is a very good combination of the Primordial Master

410
00:58:31,768 --> 00:58:32,985
and Shri Krishna.

411
00:58:33,186 --> 00:58:35,955
That is Vishuddhi chakra, you see.

01:03:36,693 --> 01:03:37,693

SY: [hindhi/marathi].

452
01:03:40,908 --> 01:03:43,727
SM: [hindhi/marathi].

453
01:03:43,928 --> 01:03:48,608
SY: All right. This, this song I am going to sing is from raag Chandrakauns,

454
01:03:48,809 --> 01:03:53,485
and is one of the songs written for

455
01:03:53,686 --> 01:03:56,093
Lord Rama, Shri... the

456
01:03:56,294 --> 01:03:58,530
SM: Rama.

457
01:03:58,731 --> 01:04:00,064
SY: [hindhi/marathi].

458
01:04:00,265 --> 01:04:03,485
The marathi writter Gudi Madgulkar wrote

459
01:04:03,686 --> 01:04:06,427
a Geet Ramayan - the Ramayan was written

460
01:04:06,628 --> 01:04:10,582
in the form of songs and this is one of the songs when

461
01:04:10,783 --> 01:04:15,320
Bharat goes to Lord Rama and request Him to come back

462
01:04:15,521 --> 01:04:20,538
and Sita on the, on the throne, called throne,

463
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:23,860
and Rama has gone for one last fourteen years

464
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:25,694
and He cannot come back,

465
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:27,992
so He, He gives him

466
01:04:28,193 --> 01:04:31,581
a farewell at the, at the bank of the river Ganges,

467
01:04:31,782 --> 01:04:36,282
with the tears in His eyes, and He, He explain to Bharat

468
01:04:36,483 --> 01:04:41,372
how much valuable it is to touch the feet of your own, own father.

469
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:44,722
I mean, in our Indian customary

470
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:47,913
we fall at the feet of mother and father -

471
01:04:48,114 --> 01:04:50,013
we consider them like Gods.

472
01:04:50,214 --> 01:04:53,294
So He explains - that's the entire meaning of it.

473
01:04:53,502 --> 01:04:56,568
SM: Means to follow the father desire, you see?

474
01:04:56,769 --> 01:04:59,435
SY: Right, yes.

475
01:07:50,462 --> 01:07:51,494

SY: [hindhi/marathi].
SM: You should sing one...

481
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:06,380
Now, your Jerusalem,

482
01:08:06,581 --> 01:08:08,867
and then aarti... What else?

483
01:08:09,104 --> 01:08:10,944
Last, aarti.

484

SY: Aarti the last.

486
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,265
SM: Aarti the last. So first you sing your songs.

487
01:08:17,466 --> 01:08:21,200
SY: We shall sing "Saints", yes.
SY: Mother, we'll try something.

488
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:22,971
first - before Jerusalem.

489
01:08:23,172 --> 01:08:26,066
Where is...? Clement?
SY: Yes.

490
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,920
SY: Why don't we sing "When the saints go marching in"? That's it.

491
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,100
SY: I don't know that. SY: You don't know it?

492
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,080
SY: If everybody else does, he'll know.

493
01:08:40,822 --> 01:08:45,521
Mother, the text is: "Oh, when the saints go marching in,

494
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:48,647
I shall be one among them -

495
01:08:48,848 --> 01:08:52,189
I want to be one among them."

496
01:10:38,086 --> 01:10:39,787
SM: Now, which one is next?

497
01:10:39,988 --> 01:10:41,355
SY: I can sing a song.

498
01:10:41,556 --> 01:10:42,859
SM: Yes, go ahead, go ahead!

499
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,282
SY: Yes, go ahead!

500
01:10:44,483 --> 01:10:47,597
SY: You see, I know so many songs but none of them us really...

501
01:10:47,798 --> 01:10:51,279
They are all...

502
01:10:54,466 --> 01:10:56,645
SY: Is better be good that one.

503
01:10:59,363 --> 01:11:01,150
SY: Next time you come for meeting,

504
01:11:01,351 --> 01:11:05,276
get prepared with an Indian song.

505
01:11:05,477 --> 01:11:07,167
SY: You'll have to sing, not of the...

506
01:11:07,368 --> 01:11:10,682

512
01:14:44,382 --> 01:14:47,585
SY: I don't, I don't think, Mother I [can do it].

513
01:14:47,786 --> 01:14:49,445
SM: Why? Why can't you?

514
01:14:49,646 --> 01:14:52,014
SY: I, I, I don't think I follow the whole of this, Mother.

515
01:14:52,215 --> 01:14:53,630
SM: You don't follow?

516
01:14:53,831 --> 01:14:56,740
SY: I, I think it's all right, Mother, the music is very [deep].

517
01:14:59,379 --> 01:15:00,372
SY: Melodious.

518
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,631
SM: You are supposed to be a master of Italian language.

519
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,298
SY: Yes, but [that song because it's melodious].

520
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,580
SY: Since it's [unclear].

521
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:06,920
SY: He sings very well.

522
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:10,060
SM: What was it about?

523
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:17,980
SY: That's what I'm doing.

524
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:19,850
SY: It's a love song over, over...

525
01:15:20,051 --> 01:15:22,569
SM: I could see that.

526
01:15:26,423 --> 01:15:29,273
It's over a man that could not reach his beloved.

527
01:15:29,478 --> 01:15:31,797
and so he sings that he's in

528
01:15:31,998 --> 01:15:35,520
in darkness, but that with a talk of his beloved

529
01:15:35,721 --> 01:15:40,200
he can sleep even out in the night.

530
01:15:40,401 --> 01:15:42,219
SM: But that could be a pray to God also.

531
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,330
SY: Yes, because I thought

532
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,880
he's singing [unclear] but as a grandchildren [unclear].

533
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,960
SM: Good ideea.

534
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:55,946
All My grandchildren want to marry Me, you'll be suprised.

535
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:01,386
SY: We can do one song more

536
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:04,740
SM: All right, come along.

537
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:09,880
This one is called "Lay Down Your Burden" and it was written by...

538
01:16:10,088 --> 01:16:12,689
Susan Osborn. She sings with Paul Winter Consort.

539
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:16,860
SY: Yes, hold the mike in your hand so you can...

540
01:16:17,061 --> 01:16:18,659
Yeah. Here, so he...

541
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:20,718
It's alright.

542
01:16:20,919 --> 01:16:22,571
Come here if you want.

543
01:16:22,772 --> 01:16:24,822
So he could tip you.

544
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:27,540
SY: OK.
SY: All right. Yeah.

545
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:03,560
SY: I just sing, I just sing one line, Mother, may I?

546
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,760
SY: What? SY: Are you sure?
SY: Just one line.

547
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,772
SM: You will sing? Only one line.

548
01:19:07,973 --> 01:19:09,460
SY: Yes.
SM: Why?

549
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:12,620
SY: Because is only one line song.

550
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:30,020
So Jerusalem you can sing now.

551
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:31,380
Why?

552
01:20:33,906 --> 01:20:35,679
You have a common music thing,

553
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,871
where is, what has happen to that we have?

554
01:20:38,072 --> 01:20:39,814
A big...

555
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:44,501
people, we had in London,

556
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:48,026
where Patricia is to play?

557
01:20:48,227 --> 01:20:50,129
SY: Mother, could we sing more [unclear]

558
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:51,767
you liked us so much in India.

559
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:53,278
SY: But we don't know it all.

560
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:56,200
SY: I know it. Brian knows it.
SY: No, he doesn't.

561
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,620
What she wants to sing?

562
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:03,180
SY: OK, then you sing it.

563
01:21:15,588 --> 01:21:18,667
SY: Dance, dance, wherever you may be,

564
01:21:18,868 --> 01:21:21,764
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He.

565
01:21:21,965 --> 01:21:24,670
And I’ll lead you all wherever you may be,

566
01:21:24,871 --> 01:21:28,209
And I’ll lead you all in the dance, said He.

567
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:31,457
I danced in the morning when the world was begun,

568
01:21:31,658 --> 01:21:34,515
I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun,

569
01:21:34,716 --> 01:21:37,821
I came down from heaven and I danced on the earth.

570
01:21:38,022 --> 01:21:41,382
At Bethlehem I had My birth.

571
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:44,658
Dance, dance, wherever you may be,

572
01:21:44,859 --> 01:21:47,732
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He.

573
01:21:47,933 --> 01:21:50,865
And I’ll lead you all wherever you may be,

574
01:21:51,066 --> 01:21:54,185
And I’ll lead you all in the dance, said He.

575
01:21:54,386 --> 01:21:57,539
I danced for the scribes and the Pharisees,

576
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:01,087
But they would not dance and they would not follow me,

577
01:22:01,288 --> 01:22:04,581
I danced for the fishermen, for James and John,

578
01:22:04,782 --> 01:22:07,998
They came to Me and the dance went on.

579
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:11,125
Dance, dance, wherever you may be,

580
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:14,335
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He.

581
01:22:14,536 --> 01:22:17,423
And I’ll lead you all wherever you may be,

582
01:22:17,624 --> 01:22:21,030
And I’ll lead you all in the dance, said He.

583
01:22:21,231 --> 01:22:24,516
I dance in the morning when the sky turns black,

584
01:22:24,717 --> 01:22:27,709
Is hard to dance with the devil on your back

585
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:31,153
They burried my body and they thought I'm gone,

586
01:22:31,354 --> 01:22:34,579
But I'm the Lord of the dance and I still go on.

587
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:37,912
Dance, dance, wherever you may be,

588
01:22:38,113 --> 01:22:40,925
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He.

589
01:22:41,126 --> 01:22:44,077
And I’ll lead you all wherever you may be,

590
01:22:44,278 --> 01:22:47,759
And I’ll lead you all in the dance, said He.

591
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:51,084
Dance, dance, wherever you may be,

592
01:22:51,285 --> 01:22:54,013
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He.

593
01:22:54,214 --> 01:22:57,282
And I’ll lead you all wherever you may be,

594
01:22:57,483 --> 01:23:01,647
And I’ll lead you all in the dance, said He.

595
01:23:08,862 --> 01:23:10,583
Next time Mother, we'll have the sheets

596
01:23:10,784 --> 01:23:13,529
with all these [bhajans], next time we ever gather together.

597
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:15,187
SY: We'll all sing together.

598
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,760
SY: We'll all know the words.

599
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:21,600
SM: Let us, let us, as singing this songs

600
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,980
think of the Heavens also.

601
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:26,538
I don't know what's going to happen

602
01:23:26,739 --> 01:23:28,673
if you all

603
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:31,409
so powerful you're singing all these songs.

604
01:23:36,651 --> 01:23:38,651
God save America.

605
01:23:45,242 --> 01:23:48,116
Then all the false gurus

606
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:53,525
they will be backing off with their [unclear]

607
01:23:56,043 --> 01:23:58,826
and will be getting out, out of New York.

608
01:23:59,027 --> 01:24:01,699
There might be a general exodus.

609
01:24:04,192 --> 01:24:05,668
SY: Shri Mataji in,

610
01:24:05,917 --> 01:24:08,818
I don't know whether is beeing written in India or in Europe

611
01:24:09,019 --> 01:24:12,439
or maybe both, but I think in India they've written a new

612
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:13,662
aarti for You.

613
01:24:13,863 --> 01:24:15,487
SM: Is it so?

614
01:24:15,688 --> 01:24:17,982
SY: And obiouvsly for the verse, I don't,

615
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:20,498
I will sing of chorus, but I don't know the verses yet,

616
01:24:20,699 --> 01:24:21,827
because is brand new one.

617
01:24:22,028 --> 01:24:25,358
It's, it's the same as Sab.ko dua dena but it's a little... It's a new one.

618
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,680
SY: Warming, warning [unclear].
SM: So let's have it!

619
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,400
SM: Wow, beautiful.

620
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:56,800
SY: So shall we sing it together?

621
01:24:57,005 --> 01:24:58,634
SY: Just sing it over there?
SY: Right!

622
01:24:58,835 --> 01:25:00,809
SY: Jay, jay Nirmala Ma,
Jay Nirmala Ma,

623
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:03,192
Adi Shakti Mataji,

624
01:25:03,393 --> 01:25:06,213
Moksha pradayni Ma,
Jay, jay Nirmala Ma.

625
01:25:06,414 --> 01:25:08,192
SM: Moksha pradayni - the giver of the

626
01:25:08,393 --> 01:25:11,056
moksha, of the liberation.

627
01:25:37,792 --> 01:25:39,792
SY - Let's, let's do it without...

628
01:25:39,993 --> 01:25:41,472
don't take it to long.

629
01:26:31,956 --> 01:26:33,480
SM: Beautiful. Who has done that?

630
01:26:33,681 --> 01:26:35,825
SY: I think it might be Moreshwar, Mother.

631
01:26:36,026 --> 01:26:37,790
SY: But it has the whole seven verses
SM: Finished?

632
01:26:37,991 --> 01:26:40,337
SY: Seven verses. That's only in the [unclear].

633
01:26:40,553 --> 01:26:42,944
SY: If he'll transfer, already in the first they'll jump the gun

634
01:26:43,145 --> 01:26:44,193
and then they gather together.

635
01:26:44,394 --> 01:26:46,911
SM: Oh, they sing Marathi ones very well.

636
01:26:47,112 --> 01:26:49,885
Yes, France people. Nobody has come from France.

637
01:26:50,087 --> 01:26:53,975
The ways they are now becoming experts in Marathi music.

638
01:26:54,176 --> 01:26:57,132
SY: Yes?
SM: Oh, waw, waw!

639
01:26:57,333 --> 01:26:59,494
Aamhi Bhi Ghadalo Tumi Bhi Ghadana.

640
01:26:59,695 --> 01:27:01,681
SY: That's nice.
SY: Yes. Can we sing it now to you Mother?

641
01:27:02,131 --> 01:27:05,594
SY: Aamhi Bhi Ghadalo Tumi Bhi Ghadana.

642
01:27:05,795 --> 01:27:07,295
SY: What's they sing?

643
01:27:07,496 --> 01:27:09,310
SY: What? What?

644
01:27:19,554 --> 01:27:21,220
They all sing in group.

645
01:27:24,835 --> 01:27:28,218
SM: Matajinchya sange mule bi ghadali

646
01:27:41,635 --> 01:27:45,860
I used to sing a lot but I've given My throat to the

647
01:27:46,061 --> 01:27:47,403
talking, I think.

648
01:27:47,604 --> 01:27:49,818
SY: Mother, I'd like to sing you a song that...

649
01:27:50,019 --> 01:27:51,556
SM: You would?
SY: Yes, he is..

650
01:27:51,757 --> 01:27:52,937
SM: That's great!
SY: I was,

651
01:27:53,138 --> 01:27:55,501
I was little worried because I feel that my Vishuddhi

652
01:27:55,702 --> 01:27:57,409
has been clearing out too quickly today. I'll do the best I can.

653
01:27:57,610 --> 01:28:00,526
SM: All right. You sing I'll give you a very good Vishuddhi, all right?

654
01:28:00,727 --> 01:28:03,198
That's the present.

655
01:28:03,399 --> 01:28:07,845
SY: This is a song I wrote. It's about, about weddings and

656
01:28:08,046 --> 01:28:09,753
how I feel about marriage.

657
01:28:09,954 --> 01:28:11,444
And I wrote up on my own marriage,

658
01:28:11,645 --> 01:28:13,596
and I feel it applies for all weddings and...

659
01:28:13,797 --> 01:28:16,208
SM: That's great. Good celebration.

660
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:56,560
SM: Very good. Now  your voice is good?

661
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:11,580
You must put some heated butter

662
01:33:11,785 --> 01:33:13,752
in the nose, all of you.

663
01:33:13,953 --> 01:33:15,688
SY: In the... inside?
SM: Inside.

664
01:33:15,889 --> 01:33:17,992
With a, with a dropper, all right?

665
01:33:18,193 --> 01:33:20,773
Heat, heat butter and sieve it out.

666
01:33:20,974 --> 01:33:23,956
And then, when it is slightly warm, not very warm,

667
01:33:24,157 --> 01:33:27,539
absolutely slightly warm, then put it in Vishuddhi. It's very important.

668
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:31,031
Because the, I don't know in this country people,

669
01:33:31,232 --> 01:33:33,309
is a very simple thing to be done.

670
01:33:34,003 --> 01:33:37,123
Once in a while, about say, two-three days later or

671
01:33:37,324 --> 01:33:39,052
even every day, doesn't matter.

672
01:33:39,253 --> 01:33:42,942
It's like putting cream on your hands, you see, because

673
01:33:43,143 --> 01:33:46,853
the cold weather, also chops inside the lining

674
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:51,906
of the nose and when you put this it makes a...

675
01:33:52,499 --> 01:33:57,988
nose smooth, and you don't get troubles of it. It's very simple.

676
01:33:58,189 --> 01:34:00,940
All of you should do, all the Sahaja Yogis are supposed to do.

677
01:34:01,141 --> 01:34:03,514
There are so many things sahaja yogi that suppose to do -

678
01:34:03,715 --> 01:34:04,722
one of them is this -

679
01:34:04,923 --> 01:34:07,915
that try to keep your Hamsa chakra all right.

680
01:34:08,116 --> 01:34:11,854
By keeping your nose all right, you keep your Hamsa chakra better.

681
01:34:12,055 --> 01:34:14,720
So, better use this

682
01:34:14,921 --> 01:34:16,048
simple method

683
01:34:16,249 --> 01:34:19,504
of heating some ghee, we call it. You see, you can prepare it

684
01:34:19,705 --> 01:34:23,842
heated butter, keep it in a bottle with a

685
01:34:24,053 --> 01:34:26,570
dropper and heat it in the hot water.

686
01:34:26,771 --> 01:34:30,608
And then put it in the nose. Just like that,

687
01:34:30,809 --> 01:34:33,116
in the night, before sleeping.

688
01:34:33,317 --> 01:34:37,070
Even in the ears, you must put olive oil - is very important.

689
01:34:37,271 --> 01:34:40,932
For the teeth also, you must take some salt,

690
01:34:41,133 --> 01:34:43,990
put some olive oil, and rub your gums.

691
01:34:44,191 --> 01:34:47,675
With that, you wont have to go to the dentist anymore.

692
01:34:47,876 --> 01:34:50,264
That's the best. I've never been to a dentist all My life

693
01:34:50,465 --> 01:34:52,745
and I don't want you to go to dentist anymore.

694
01:34:52,946 --> 01:34:55,680
So that's a very good way of rubbing your gums

695
01:34:55,881 --> 01:35:01,016
with vibrated salt and what you call, the olive oil.

696
01:35:01,217 --> 01:35:03,242
Also you must oil your heads,

697
01:35:03,443 --> 01:35:07,351
every Saturday, with so much of oil, nicely.

698
01:35:07,552 --> 01:35:09,452
Oil it, massage you head

699
01:35:09,661 --> 01:35:12,095
and sleep off and next day wash off your head.

700
01:35:12,296 --> 01:35:13,760
You feel very much better.

701
01:35:13,961 --> 01:35:15,395
If any of you cannot get olive oil,

702
01:35:15,596 --> 01:35:17,577
the best is almond oil for the head.

703
01:35:17,778 --> 01:35:19,218
Keeps you very peaceful.

704
01:35:19,419 --> 01:35:21,473
Especially your children, you must massage them

705
01:35:21,674 --> 01:35:23,054
till they are five years of age,

706
01:35:23,319 --> 01:35:26,594
every night, when they go off to sleep, in the night.

707
01:35:26,795 --> 01:35:31,646
Nicely, very, for before sleep. And then put some powder

708
01:35:31,847 --> 01:35:33,402
clean it out and let them sleep.

709
01:35:33,603 --> 01:35:36,268
Then the children won't be running and upset and all that.

710
01:35:36,469 --> 01:35:39,304
They'll become very quiet children, well behave children.

711
01:35:39,505 --> 01:35:41,454
Because you people don't massage the children

712
01:35:41,655 --> 01:35:43,361
all their lifes they are jumping.

713
01:35:43,562 --> 01:35:45,663
And all their lives, they're likely violent.

714
01:35:45,864 --> 01:35:48,417
You see, this is the nerves must be soothed down.

715
01:35:48,618 --> 01:35:50,784
A very simple method and as you are

716
01:35:50,985 --> 01:35:53,628
realised people you sooth them much more.

717
01:35:53,829 --> 01:35:57,268
All these small, small things must be taken care of, you see.

718
01:35:57,469 --> 01:36:00,677
Now if you have too much of cold,

719
01:36:00,878 --> 01:36:02,411
if you have too much of cold,

720
01:36:02,612 --> 01:36:06,703
then you can mix up little camphor, with oil

721
01:36:06,904 --> 01:36:09,815
and put that in the nose - little I said, not much.

722
01:36:10,016 --> 01:36:11,293
That also is very good.

723
01:36:11,494 --> 01:36:14,404
That also soothes your cold and puts you right.

724
01:36:14,605 --> 01:36:17,612
This country has one big problem: is Vishuddhi chakra everywhere

725
01:36:17,813 --> 01:36:19,958
in the West - because of the cold.

726
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:22,370
And in Sahaja Yoga it is compulsory

727
01:36:22,571 --> 01:36:24,561
that you must wear an undershirt.

728
01:36:24,762 --> 01:36:26,457
It is compulsory.

729
01:36:26,658 --> 01:36:29,155
Whatever may be - it is hot, cold, anything.

730
01:36:29,356 --> 01:36:33,038
In India even when extremely hot, you must wear an undershirt

731
01:36:33,239 --> 01:36:37,120
because when it is very hot you start perspiring

732
01:36:37,321 --> 01:36:40,342
and that perspiration causes problems.

733
01:36:40,543 --> 01:36:43,260
So, always wear an undershirt

734
01:36:43,461 --> 01:36:46,408
whether you are in a hot season or a cold season.

735
01:36:46,609 --> 01:36:50,204
That's a compulsion for Sahaja Yogis, that they must wear.

736
01:36:50,405 --> 01:36:53,286
And for all of them also is compulsory

737
01:36:53,487 --> 01:36:56,156
that they should always wear a muffler

738
01:36:56,357 --> 01:36:58,568
when they go out during winter time -

739
01:36:58,769 --> 01:37:02,879
it is an important thing. And also put some these

740
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:06,401
cotton wools in the ears, as I put it.

741
01:37:06,602 --> 01:37:09,493
For your sake I have to put it, because you are careless.

742
01:37:09,694 --> 01:37:12,874
So I look after you by putting into My ears like this.

743
01:37:13,075 --> 01:37:15,183
So you all should put it before going out.

744
01:37:15,384 --> 01:37:19,893
And keep your head covered in the night - when you sleep

745
01:37:20,094 --> 01:37:22,094
cover your head with something and then sleep.

746
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:23,396
Because most of the time

747
01:37:23,597 --> 01:37:25,894
your body is all covered but the head is not covered.

748
01:37:26,095 --> 01:37:29,754
Because now you are realized souls, and your Sahasrara is weak.

749
01:37:29,955 --> 01:37:31,842
So you must look after your Sahasrara.

750
01:37:32,043 --> 01:37:35,582
Cover you head, so that you won't have any problem.

751
01:37:35,783 --> 01:37:39,180
Also you must verify what sort of a person you are.

752
01:37:39,381 --> 01:37:42,851
If you have a liver problem, then you get a diet for that,

753
01:37:43,052 --> 01:37:45,043
which is here - people will tell you.

754
01:37:45,244 --> 01:37:48,974
If you left sided person, if you have left sided problem

755
01:37:49,175 --> 01:37:51,813
then you must know about the diet - what you have to take.

756
01:37:52,014 --> 01:37:53,772
For example a person who's a left sided

757
01:37:53,973 --> 01:37:55,815
should not taken carbohydrates at all.

758
01:37:56,016 --> 01:37:59,294
On the contrary, should eat proteins in whatever form it is possible.

759
01:37:59,579 --> 01:38:00,682
In Sahaja Yoga, you know,

760
01:38:00,883 --> 01:38:02,793
we don't believe in vegetarianism or anything

761
01:38:02,994 --> 01:38:05,747
but we do believe that the

762
01:38:06,338 --> 01:38:10,973
muscles of the bigger animals than us are not god for our teeth,

763
01:38:11,174 --> 01:38:13,720
or for our body also because the

764
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:16,768
structure of a muscular cell of a biger animal

765
01:38:16,969 --> 01:38:18,786
is much bigger then ours.

766
01:38:18,987 --> 01:38:21,048
And that's how they eat up. I mean

767
01:38:21,264 --> 01:38:25,254
even by mistake if I eat something or anybody asked Me the other day -

768
01:38:25,455 --> 01:38:27,679
behind My teeth were swollen up.

769
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:30,987
So that's what it happens. It is an automatic reaction.

770
01:38:31,188 --> 01:38:34,621
And we are not supposed to use plastics

771
01:38:34,822 --> 01:38:36,924
in our

772
01:38:37,551 --> 01:38:39,432
clothes. Also try to avoid -

773
01:38:39,633 --> 01:38:42,228
some percentage of plastic we may use, but not

774
01:38:42,429 --> 01:38:44,724
all time plastics and nylons.

775
01:38:44,925 --> 01:38:47,780
And also the food should not be eaten in plastics.

776
01:38:47,981 --> 01:38:52,195
You can eat it in paper - paper is all right, because it is -

777
01:38:52,396 --> 01:38:55,245
what you call - is good, does't matter.

778
01:38:55,526 --> 01:38:59,335
But you shouldn't eat in plastic, food, plastic with

779
01:38:59,536 --> 01:39:01,744
forks and spoons of plastic and...

780
01:39:01,945 --> 01:39:03,531
It's too much plastic in this country.

781
01:39:03,732 --> 01:39:05,680
So be careful because plastic is

782
01:39:05,881 --> 01:39:11,165
anti-God, it is anti-human life, it is anti-biological processes.

783
01:39:11,366 --> 01:39:14,093
So avoid plastics as far as possible.

784
01:39:14,294 --> 01:39:17,232
Be careful on that and also don't use

785
01:39:17,433 --> 01:39:19,574
made something out of absolute plastic.

786
01:39:19,791 --> 01:39:22,534
Like I've seen, I wanted to buy one pair of

787
01:39:22,735 --> 01:39:25,498
slippers for Myself - I couldn't get one

788
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,039
in the whole of Europe.

789
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:29,621
Because I didn't want a plastic.

790
01:39:29,846 --> 01:39:31,514
And if you wear that, then you develop

791
01:39:31,715 --> 01:39:34,994
all kinds of skin troubles, skin diseases - so be careful on that.

792
01:39:35,294 --> 01:39:38,128
There are so many other things we are to be careful about,

793
01:39:38,329 --> 01:39:41,494
and because we have found out that these things that are harmful

794
01:39:41,695 --> 01:39:43,123
that's why we have made it compulsory:

795
01:39:43,324 --> 01:39:46,242
that everyone of you must be careful.

796
01:39:46,506 --> 01:39:49,027
Because now you are become the temple of God.

797
01:39:49,228 --> 01:39:53,084
And the temple of God should be healthy.

798
01:39:53,709 --> 01:39:56,399
We don't want tubercular patients

799
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:59,560
to go around as saints. Nobody is going to believe them.

800
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:04,880
SY: You just tell them about sugar.

801
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:08,380
SM: Now there's another falsehood about - thank God is now broken -

802
01:40:08,579 --> 01:40:12,264
that the sugar is against our...

803
01:40:12,465 --> 01:40:15,617
growth and all that. Sugar is very important for attention.

804
01:40:15,818 --> 01:40:18,003
Especially people who suffer from liver.

805
01:40:18,204 --> 01:40:21,541
For example people who are thin, mostly suffer from liver trouble.

806
01:40:21,742 --> 01:40:26,378
For them sugar is so important that if they don't take sugar

807
01:40:26,579 --> 01:40:29,785
they'll become like the sugar cane which has

808
01:40:29,986 --> 01:40:31,426
come out of the

809
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:33,340
machine, pressing machine, you see?

810
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,560
Better take some sugar.

811
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:38,860
Sugar is very important for your liver.

812
01:40:39,069 --> 01:40:42,014
Best carbohydrate is white sugar, not the red sugar.

813
01:40:42,215 --> 01:40:45,959
Red sugar is not good because it has got molasses - it's very heating.

814
01:40:46,168 --> 01:40:48,689
Some people have funny ideas here

815
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:52,413
also about food. Like some of them believe

816
01:40:52,614 --> 01:40:54,193
that if you eat natural food -

817
01:40:54,394 --> 01:40:56,590
once I got something from natural store

818
01:40:56,791 --> 01:40:58,507
and I got diarrhea for five days.

819
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:02,800
Because it was meant for animals not for the... human beings.

820
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:07,380
Like some people eat, what you call them, [hindhi/marathi],

821
01:41:07,568 --> 01:41:08,667
Cotton seed!

822
01:41:08,868 --> 01:41:11,191
Now, cotton seed we give only to animals,

823
01:41:11,392 --> 01:41:14,104
you can't believe even. But I've seen in Switzerland,

824
01:41:14,305 --> 01:41:16,533
they give cotton seed in the bread.

825
01:41:16,734 --> 01:41:19,017
There was cotton seed in the bread. One or two is all right,

826
01:41:19,218 --> 01:41:21,808
but imagine, [hindhi/marathi].

827
01:41:22,009 --> 01:41:25,530
[hindhi/marathi]. We can give it to buffaloes only.

828
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:28,252
And that was given and you get diarrhea with it.

829
01:41:28,453 --> 01:41:29,958
You see, this's a very strong things.

830
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:32,668
In the same way very soft food is also not good.

831
01:41:32,874 --> 01:41:34,701
We have to be in the centre in everything.

832
01:41:34,902 --> 01:41:37,048
Don't eat very rough food, you see like...

833
01:41:37,249 --> 01:41:40,855
some of the bread in France, you know, even in England we find,

834
01:41:41,056 --> 01:41:43,803
it breaks your gums completely.

835
01:41:44,004 --> 01:41:46,480
So that kind of a crispy stuff not need it.

836
01:41:46,681 --> 01:41:49,173
It should be such that your gums are

837
01:41:49,374 --> 01:41:51,544
looked after - they are delicate things

838
01:41:51,745 --> 01:41:56,566
and have food which is good for you.

839
01:41:56,767 --> 01:41:59,805
Don't go with nationality, don't go with the fashion

840
01:42:00,006 --> 01:42:02,408
but whatever is good for you that should be done.

841
01:42:02,609 --> 01:42:05,605
And you find out about yourself, what is your temperament,

842
01:42:05,806 --> 01:42:08,595
what sort of a food will soothe you

843
01:42:08,796 --> 01:42:10,515
and accordingly you should eat.

844
01:42:10,716 --> 01:42:13,692
Of course, everybody is free to do what they like

845
01:42:13,893 --> 01:42:16,089
but we can only advice them that this will soothe you,

846
01:42:16,290 --> 01:42:19,445
and you'll find it will be very helpful to all of you.

847
01:42:19,646 --> 01:42:20,646
It will help you.

848
01:42:20,847 --> 01:42:24,606
For you hair growth, also you should get vibrated

849
01:42:24,807 --> 01:42:26,568
oil and use it. Now,

850
01:42:26,769 --> 01:42:29,340
you'll be surprised the other day somebody saw Warren and he said,

851
01:42:29,541 --> 01:42:31,437
"This is the same fellow? Looks much younger.

852
01:42:31,667 --> 01:42:34,814
So I said, "Yes, he had a baldness from here to here, like that.

853
01:42:35,015 --> 01:42:36,568
And now he's grown hair.

854
01:42:36,769 --> 01:42:39,670
With proper care, you can have your hair

855
01:42:39,871 --> 01:42:43,938
quite intact for quite sometime - if you look after your hair.

856
01:42:44,139 --> 01:42:46,836
But hair is why important, is not so much look,

857
01:42:47,037 --> 01:42:48,778
but the Sahasrara.

858
01:42:48,979 --> 01:42:53,520
And if you put oil in your Sahasrara every week,

859
01:42:53,721 --> 01:42:56,759
you will have a smoothe personality,

860
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:00,709
a smooth behavior, a smooth movement,

861
01:43:00,910 --> 01:43:04,462
you'll deal with other people in a gentle manner.

862
01:43:04,663 --> 01:43:08,393
So this is very necessary. In India we actually have a big

863
01:43:08,594 --> 01:43:12,548
masseur attached to a family, see - is a very hefty fellow.

864
01:43:12,749 --> 01:43:15,346
And he comes to massage the men, you see, he just

865
01:43:15,547 --> 01:43:16,547
sits on their body

866
01:43:16,748 --> 01:43:19,677
and really finishes them off completely.

867
01:43:21,199 --> 01:43:22,813
At the first shot they are dead.

868
01:43:23,014 --> 01:43:26,823
Then he uses their body fully and push it and sits on them

869
01:43:27,024 --> 01:43:29,219
and rubs them. With the, one clap - you see,

870
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:32,062
five, six of them will be jumping on five, six people -

871
01:43:32,263 --> 01:43:34,784
with clap, they'll go round. By the time the second job comes in

872
01:43:34,985 --> 01:43:36,829
the person is finished.

873
01:43:37,630 --> 01:43:38,637
That's how they manage.

874
01:43:38,838 --> 01:43:41,716
But that, there's no importance of massaging here, you see.

875
01:43:41,917 --> 01:43:45,561
And don't ask a nonsahaja yogi to massage you. Never.

876
01:43:45,762 --> 01:43:48,419
Don't allow anybody to touch you that way.

877
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:50,458
Because, you see, these people carry

878
01:43:50,659 --> 01:43:53,708
all bad vibrations and you may suffer.

879
01:43:53,909 --> 01:43:58,963
You must allow only the realized souls to massage you, if possible,

880
01:43:59,164 --> 01:44:01,368
or you, yourself should massage yourself.

881
01:44:01,569 --> 01:44:04,672
But don't go to this masseurs and people

882
01:44:04,873 --> 01:44:06,540
who are massaging all kinds of people

883
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:08,974
and they might be given you some troubles.

884
01:44:09,175 --> 01:44:12,480
So one has to be very careful about certain things and

885
01:44:12,681 --> 01:44:15,396
certain person habits also, which we have discussed.

886
01:44:15,597 --> 01:44:18,150
And you can ask Warren, he will tell you about it,

887
01:44:18,351 --> 01:44:21,123
which are very important for Mooladhara and all those things,

888
01:44:21,324 --> 01:44:22,783
which must be followed,

889
01:44:22,984 --> 01:44:24,590
whether you are in England, America, anywhere.

890
01:44:24,791 --> 01:44:29,373
This must be followed to keep yourself clean outside and inside.

891
01:44:29,574 --> 01:44:32,214
Now, if you have any questions?

892
01:44:32,415 --> 01:44:34,279
SY: I was only wondering, Mataji,

893
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:36,214
any kind of technique that we should do

894
01:44:36,415 --> 01:44:38,288
when massaging the children?

895
01:44:38,489 --> 01:44:40,055
But I guess that [unclear].

896
01:44:40,256 --> 01:44:43,082
SM: I mean any way you use is all right, but always

897
01:44:43,283 --> 01:44:45,042
put it a upwards, you see,

898
01:44:45,243 --> 01:44:48,869
The movement should be upward but use oil, otherwise you

899
01:44:49,085 --> 01:44:52,752
pull out their hair. So use oil to put it up first.

900
01:44:52,953 --> 01:44:54,403
SY: And don't forget the Sahasrara.

901
01:44:54,604 --> 01:44:57,221
SM: Sahasrara don't forget, Sahasrara you must put

902
01:44:57,422 --> 01:44:59,748
lot of oil on children.

903
01:44:59,949 --> 01:45:01,669
SY: Mother we gonna a need more

904
01:45:01,870 --> 01:45:05,306
hairdressers, people who can cut hair for us, realized souls,

905
01:45:05,507 --> 01:45:08,581
because they have us touching on our Sahasrara with the haircut.

906
01:45:08,782 --> 01:45:11,069
SM: Yes, otherwise you can grow, what's the harm?

907
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:13,163
SY: We can grow our hair Mother?

908
01:45:13,364 --> 01:45:16,416
SM: Yes, here up to here you can grow and cut them round.

909
01:45:20,348 --> 01:45:24,031
See, you'll look like a philosopher, quite impressive.

910
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:33,978
But you should not be a funny looking person, or a jocular personality.

911
01:45:34,179 --> 01:45:36,310
That's one thing very important, you see,

912
01:45:36,511 --> 01:45:40,050
you have not to adopt some funny methods, you see,

913
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:41,398
like people have.

914
01:45:41,599 --> 01:45:44,983
Especially nowadays the fashion is to dishevel you hair

915
01:45:45,184 --> 01:45:48,175
and keep them absolutely disheveled. There is no need to...

916
01:45:48,376 --> 01:45:49,982
SY: Tell them to keep the hair out of the [unclear].

917
01:45:50,183 --> 01:45:52,412
SY: The hair must be off the forehead.

918
01:45:52,613 --> 01:45:55,369
SM: Yes! Should be kept back over the forehead.

919
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:57,688
Don't cover your forehead, or your eyes -

920
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:00,020
- never. SY: And also the Agya chakra will stay back.

921
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:03,260
SM: Yes. You must keep it open, you see, always open.

922
01:46:03,468 --> 01:46:06,548
Parted. You must have a central part if is possible,

923
01:46:06,749 --> 01:46:09,582
but keep the forehead open - is important.

924
01:46:09,783 --> 01:46:13,057
Keep the forehead open - is very good for others, you see,

925
01:46:13,258 --> 01:46:17,057
and don't cover your eyes with any hair. Many people have a habit

926
01:46:17,258 --> 01:46:21,001
of allowing the hair to come on the eyes, and you'll have squints.

927
01:46:21,202 --> 01:46:25,221
Children also, never allow hair to come on their eyes.

928
01:46:25,771 --> 01:46:28,392
Then we have some things for the eyes also,

929
01:46:28,593 --> 01:46:31,265
what you call Neetranjan - I don't have now anything.

930
01:46:31,466 --> 01:46:34,418
But is a very good simple thing, cost you nothing, about

931
01:46:34,619 --> 01:46:37,584
[Neetranjan] is just ten-eleven rupee, meaning how much here?

932
01:46:38,163 --> 01:46:39,852
One tenth of a dollar.

933
01:46:40,053 --> 01:46:42,122
All right, they have some, they'll give you,

934
01:46:42,323 --> 01:46:45,555
each is to be applied first very carefully

935
01:46:47,011 --> 01:46:49,691
If you are not use to it, it will little bit burn and the tears

936
01:46:49,892 --> 01:46:52,536
will start coming out of your eyes. It will clear your eyes.

937
01:46:52,737 --> 01:46:54,732
And you'll be surprised with that, if you use it,

938
01:46:54,933 --> 01:46:57,153
you don't develop these bags and things like that.

939
01:46:57,354 --> 01:47:00,929
And the water close out - is very simple thing.

940
01:47:01,130 --> 01:47:03,955
And for soap also,

941
01:47:04,156 --> 01:47:06,886
try to use natural soaps.

942
01:47:07,087 --> 01:47:08,100
Better is -

943
01:47:08,301 --> 01:47:11,998
because here the soaps are such, that I don't know what to say.

944
01:47:12,199 --> 01:47:13,632
SY: Palmolive, Mother.

945
01:47:13,833 --> 01:47:16,274
Palmolive I think is about the only soap you can get here.

946
01:47:16,475 --> 01:47:19,219
SM: Yes, that is good, Palmolive.

947
01:47:20,289 --> 01:47:22,289
It's very good.

948
01:47:31,853 --> 01:47:32,916
Now, what else?

949
01:47:33,117 --> 01:47:35,495
SY: Jerusalem.
SY: Mother, I have one question here.

950
01:47:35,696 --> 01:47:37,759
SM: Yes.
SY: Another question.

951
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:40,714
SY: My son has [unclear]

952
01:47:40,915 --> 01:47:44,431
it's fluid in the ears.

953
01:47:45,437 --> 01:47:48,389
SY: Her son gets fluid in the ears. What can he do?
SM: All right, what you do

954
01:47:48,590 --> 01:47:50,977
it's to take a little oil

955
01:47:51,178 --> 01:47:55,623
and heat with some cloves.

956
01:47:55,824 --> 01:47:57,771
Cloves?

957
01:47:57,972 --> 01:47:59,375
SY: Cloves.
SM: Cloves, cloves.

958
01:47:59,576 --> 01:48:01,425
SY: No, cloves.
SM: Cloves.

959
01:48:01,626 --> 01:48:04,086
And let the oil be little bit

960
01:48:04,287 --> 01:48:07,531
cooled down. When is quite cooled down, not, should not be

961
01:48:07,732 --> 01:48:11,034
burning hot at all, but just warm - you can feel it -

962
01:48:11,235 --> 01:48:13,573
then put it in the ears.

963
01:48:13,774 --> 01:48:14,991
SY: Olive oil?

964
01:48:15,192 --> 01:48:17,637
SM: Olive oil is all right.

965
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,516
But do it quite often.

966
01:48:24,717 --> 01:48:27,954
So what happens, that the oil goes inside and the fluid comes out.

967
01:48:28,155 --> 01:48:29,676
SY: Mother, could you explain to them

968
01:48:29,877 --> 01:48:32,676
the significance of vibrated sugar and vibrated salt and

969
01:48:32,877 --> 01:48:34,497
that giving vibrations to these things.

970
01:48:34,698 --> 01:48:36,586
They don't quite understand the significance

971
01:48:36,787 --> 01:48:39,064
of vibrating everything.

972
01:48:39,265 --> 01:48:41,339
SM: You see, because God has given you vibrations,

973
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:43,176
the power is flowing through you now.

974
01:48:43,377 --> 01:48:44,754
The vibrations are there.

975
01:48:44,964 --> 01:48:48,582
So whatever you get from outside is touched by so many people,

976
01:48:48,783 --> 01:48:51,562
so many people have created it and they haven't got

977
01:48:51,764 --> 01:48:53,653
a good mind or maybe something wrong with them.

978
01:48:53,854 --> 01:48:55,284
Best thing is to give them

979
01:48:55,485 --> 01:48:57,447
a bandhan before eating. Any food you eat,

980
01:48:57,648 --> 01:48:59,852
you must give the bandhan like this, three times,

981
01:49:00,053 --> 01:49:04,135
so your vibrations flow into the food and you get it sanctified.

982
01:49:04,336 --> 01:49:07,011
Or else, you can also

983
01:49:07,212 --> 01:49:11,018
use your hands for eating. If you have washed your hands then it's all right.

984
01:49:11,219 --> 01:49:14,668
Or else, if you are taking the water, you can just

985
01:49:14,869 --> 01:49:17,590
put your hands - then it gets vibrated, then drink it.

986
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:19,493
Because, the thing is,

987
01:49:19,694 --> 01:49:21,906
the vibrations have starting flowing through your hands

988
01:49:22,107 --> 01:49:25,349
but still have not spread to your body fully.

989
01:49:29,311 --> 01:49:31,786
SY: When you are vibrating food, you can actually feel

990
01:49:31,987 --> 01:49:35,587
hot food emitting a cool breeze - it's quite remarkable.

991
01:49:35,788 --> 01:49:39,935
SM: Even, even you'll find cool breeze from a candle.

992
01:49:40,404 --> 01:49:41,800
SY: What's this? It's water or what?

993
01:49:42,001 --> 01:49:44,672
SY - Yeah, water, and the other one is [unclear].

994
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,500
SY: [hindhi/marathi].
SM: What is this?

995
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:47,580
SY: It's water.

996
01:49:47,772 --> 01:49:49,268
SM: Is it cold.
SY: Yes, it's cold.

997
01:49:49,469 --> 01:49:52,819
SM: [hindhi/marathi].

998
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:56,451
SM - [hindhi/marathi].

999
01:49:56,652 --> 01:49:58,736
SM: Yes. So, now we'll sing that

1000
01:49:58,937 --> 01:50:00,698
Jerusalem. SY: Yes.

1001
01:50:00,899 --> 01:50:04,401
SM: And then the aarti.

1002
01:50:04,627 --> 01:50:08,052
One aarti he'll sing of Dhatatreya and then the aarti, our own.

1003
01:50:21,402 --> 01:50:22,402
Sit down. Sit down.

1004
01:50:22,611 --> 01:50:24,180
Stand up. All of you have to stand up.

1005
01:50:24,381 --> 01:50:26,679
Come along, all of you stand up here. Looks very nice.

1006
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:29,690
The little children should be here.

1007
01:50:29,891 --> 01:50:31,503
SY: All the, all the children.

1008
01:50:31,704 --> 01:50:33,010
SM: All the children.

1009
01:50:33,211 --> 01:50:35,314
SY: We stand up anywhere?
SM: This side.

1010
01:50:35,515 --> 01:50:37,044
SY - Over here.
SM - Or there.

1011
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:40,140
There will be better. SY: Not near the microphone.

1012
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:47,700
May God bless you all.

1013
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:23,440
SM: May God bless you all!

1014
01:59:32,391 --> 01:59:36,924
Now, tomorrow I would like to see the new people

1015
01:59:37,125 --> 01:59:41,836
and doing the meditation here. New people,

1016
01:59:42,037 --> 01:59:44,132
who have not been

1017
01:59:44,333 --> 01:59:46,840
before to our any other programs.

1018
01:59:47,041 --> 01:59:50,109
SY: Did you all hear that? Mother would like to see all the new people

1019
01:59:50,310 --> 01:59:53,828
that have never been to any of the regular meditation programs before,

1020
01:59:54,029 --> 01:59:56,652
to come here for the morning meditation

1021
01:59:56,853 --> 01:59:59,278
and after the morning meditation She'll see you all.

1022
01:59:59,479 --> 02:00:02,397
SM: New York and Boston and anywhere,

1023
02:00:02,598 --> 02:00:04,491
they are coming for the first time.

1024
02:00:04,692 --> 02:00:06,768
SY: Those who are coming for the first time...
