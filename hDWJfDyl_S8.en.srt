65
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:49,210
determinations on calhfa's

66
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:52,660

using so if the easiest thing is to be

76
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:23,380

77
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:25,030
don't have to think to be sincere you

78
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,819
don't have to think if you have to be

00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:47,889
then sincerity itself is rewarding this

85
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:52,229
