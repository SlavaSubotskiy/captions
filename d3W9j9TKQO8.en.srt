1
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:15,009
But if your attention goes higher say my attention is I'm only nothing but charity what am I

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,920
We just flows

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
You just become the charity

4
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,839
So the difference between a person who isn't realized and not realizes is that

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,489
the attention

6
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:34,170
which was

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,910
Giving myth as a reality to you

8
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,579
He's gone. He's gone higher

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,160
It can see that it is myth

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:52,219
Attention can clearly see that it is myth and you can see that yourself and you can remove yourself

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,989
That of course I have to give you a push not out and I'm working hard on that to give you a push

12
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,529
But you should also know that mythical things must be dropped

13
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,470
Otherwise, you will not grow

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,040
All mythical things must be dropped

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,050
and the best way to do it is to be in thoughtless awareness because as soon as you transcend these three gunas

16
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:25,320
You become thoughtlessly aware. You have to cross agnya. Once you cross agnya these three gunas

17
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,280
Absolutely, you go into a state where you're "gunateet". You're beyond gunas

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,119
So you do not deliberately do anything but it just works out

19
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:49,930
So now for you because you are enlightened now is to understand that our attention has to higher and higher

20
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:59,410
At a higher space now actually what has happened in realization your Kundalini has risen

21
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,060
And has come up

22
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,360
Jut like you can say a small thin hair - one hair

23
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,700
That has broken your Sahasrara

24
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,820
And now the grace is flowing it

25
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:30,329
But it's a very small movement that has taken place of course, which is a very difficult movement no doubt, but it has taken place

26
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,529
Now you have not expanded like this

27
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,790
Your chakras are only pierced in the center

28
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,880
But the rest of the attention is still intact actually it is so intact

29
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,210
That you don't even feel that it is pierced

30
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Now you have to expand that

31
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,320
Open it out

32
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,290
So that more strands of Kundalini can rise

33
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,880
And your attention

34
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,980
Which is in these centers expands.

35
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,919
By expansion it drives out all that is mythical on the sides on every Center

36
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:28,859
We have our attention which is being enlightened in the center through this light passing through

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,159
But light is too small for the darkness that you have collected

38
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,339
Especially for people of the West I would say your confusions

39
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,760
We must get rid of them

40
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,859
But still you identify because if I ask you anything, how are you?

41
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Means what?

42
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,460
Means you're still confused. All right?

43
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,040
Confusion should go

44
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:09,289
One confusion was there that

45
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:11,189
this is

46
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:16,489
Realization or not? I hope that's over now with you people at least now you believe it is self-realization

47
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:20,209
I have to tell people know why are self-realized now you are

48
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:22,789
Still they would jump up like jack-in-the-box

49
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,589
You see, "No we are not Mother". How do you say this is a realization?

50
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:30,739
We expect this out of realization

51
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:37,219
that out of realization that we will be flying out of the door if you are realized or something nonsensical I mean

52
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,750
Thank God these ideas have gone away, but when we are realized

53
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:50,780
There is light that has come in us we have to grow it only by separating our attention from the myths

54
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:59,479
It's all mythical I also play with you because unless and until

55
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:10,780
You are sure I am not going to give you a wrong idea about yourself I

56
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:20,320
I want to see how far still your attention is moving and I know still you are not sure

57
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,460
Still you are not sure of yourself

58
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,340
That's why the confidence is not there

59
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,200
First of all, you have to learn how to drive

60
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,719
Then you are tested there will be five stones put

61
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,770
together

62
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:52,659
the distance will be only that hardly a car can pass through and the fellow will say you bring it zig zag and

63
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:55,838
You cannot do it. Why?

64
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,348
That's how he makes you a master

65
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,059
The mastery of your attention

66
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,920
will come when you will start seeing in that it is all a myth that

67
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,540
that upsets you

68
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
It's all a myth that upsets you

69
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,930
Just throw it out

70
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:28,120
Just throw it away and understand that you are the eternal

71
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
attention

72
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,500
That you are the eternal life

73
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:43,020
That the only thing that keeps you away from it is ignorance

74
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:51,860
And the ignorance is too simple to understand that you have accepted myth as truth

75
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Just drop it, it's all myth

76
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,310
You'll be amazed

77
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
How your attention will rise

78
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:07,479
And you will see all these nonsensical things

79
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:16,540
Which used to frighten you or to elate you will drop out and you just smile at it

80
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,680
And then only

81
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,440
You are going to enjoy yourself fully because your attention

82
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:27,759
Will be completely drenched into the Bliss of self

83
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,019
I'm saying you will I say you are

84
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,550
Already drenched

85
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,979
into that bliss

86
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Keep it up

87
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,210
Now how to do it

88
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,069
Actually in every day-to-day life

89
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,029
How to kill the memory of the past

90
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,360
To kill the memory of the past is to have new memories

91
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,869
You must remember when you got your first sterilization

92
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,010
Always think of it

93
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,309
Whenever any such memory comes to you

94
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,960
You try to think

95
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
How you've got your realization

96
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:33,239
Any memory that is troublesome or even so-called elating you just try to remember

97
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,450
How realization has come to you

98
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:43,899
When you feel aggressive

99
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,258
About something or angry something

100
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,449
Just try to remember how you felt the joy of surrendering

101
00:08:55,509 --> 00:09:01,049
Just think of that joy of surrendering of dissolving in yourself

102
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:04,888
So the new memories must be built up

103
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,519
if you start building up new memories

104
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,640
Then you will start collecting moments to establish other

105
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,120
Moments which have such memories

106
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:30,899
Like a memory when you try to help somebody you raise the Kundalini of someone

107
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,829
Now the problem would be when you will be raising the Kundalini of others you will be in thoughtless awareness

108
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:41,249
There won't be any thought and thought is the only thing which impresses

109
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:45,839
But that time you can record the joy

110
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:49,889
Of raising the Kundalini

111
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,630
If you could record the joy of raising the Kundalini

112
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,680
Of others

113
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,770
You will feel a new

114
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,270
Wealth of these beautiful moments will be accumulated

115
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,650
and all of those moments, which we're

116
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,300
Giving you confusion or fear

117
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Or so-called unhappiness and happiness will drop and pure joy

118
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,060
Because now most of the experiences you have had are more of joy

119
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:42,760
Joy has no thoughts. It's just an experience protection

120
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,580
That's why I said you keep your eyes open

121
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,929
I hope you'll understand what I mean

122
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,040
May God bless you
