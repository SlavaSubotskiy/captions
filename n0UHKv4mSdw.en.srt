1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,280
Today you all have gathered here

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,720
to do the Guru Puja.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,160
Your Guru is a Mother first and then a Guru

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,400
and that has given Me a greater help.

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,800
We have had before also many Guru Pujas,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,560
mostly in England.

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,600
And you should wonder why

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,600
Mother always somehow is doing Guru Puja in London.

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,080
The time falls in such a way that it is in Guru Puja,

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,120
I am here, during that time I have to be in London.

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,040
So many years we have been doing Guru Puja in England.

12
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,360
All things happen if according to ritambhara pragya

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,480
then there must be some reason

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,560
why Mother is here in England for a Guru Puja.

15
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,880
It is stated in the Puranas that

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,520
the Adi Guru Datattreya

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,880
worshipped Mother

18
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,880
along the banks of the river Tamasa.

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,280
Tamasa is the same as your Thames

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,880
and He himself came and worshipped here.

21
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,200
And the druids, those who had

22
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,160
the manifestation of the Stonehenge and all that,

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,640
are originated from that time in this great country of Shiva,

24
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,640
of the Spirit.

25
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,520
So the Spirit resides here as in the heart of human beings,

26
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,320
and the Sahasrara

27
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,440
is in the Himalayas where Sadashiva exists at the Kailasha.

28
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,320
This is the great secret

29
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,040
of we having so many Guru Pujas here.

30
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,320
To culminate it today and to this special type of Guru Puja

31
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,480
in the year of the sixtieth birthday of your Mother

32
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,920
is, has a special, very, very special significance

33
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,360
because is the Guru Sashti -

34
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,440
is the sixty years of your Guru has been celebrated today.

35
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,800
And that's how it's a very big occasion that you all have gathered

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,280
under the influence of again ritambhara pragya.

37
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,720
So all that has happened has happened by the nature's own gift to you

38
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,600
and everything has worked out so well

39
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,120
because that was the desire of the Divine

40
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,360
and the design of the Divine.

41
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,000
So the river Thames, which we call Her as Thames -

42
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,320
you see, English have a method of making everything English.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,880
Like Bombay they made it - Mumbai was Bombay,

44
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,280
you see, like Calcutta, like all other words just like that.

45
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,200
Like Varanasi was made into Benares,

46
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,080
River Thames which was really Tamsa was called as Thames.

47
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,600
Now from the name Tamsa one should know

48
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,680
that is a place of Tamo Guna.

49
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,520
Is a place where left-sided resided since long.

50
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,200
So people were very worshipful, left-sided people, emotional type,

51
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,440
and they worshipped God more

52
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,440
than that they went into yagyas and all that.

53
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,160
And Datattreya lived here

54
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,040
and meditated on the banks of River Thames.

55
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,040
That's why Guru puja here has to give us a great background

56
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,200
for your awakening of the Guru Principle.

57
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,960
We have to go to the roots of everything

58
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,000
so that we understand the importance of it.

59
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,400
Unless and until you know the roots and the traditions behind

60
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,800
you cannot understand the depth,

61
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,600
the gravity, the intensity of any puja.

62
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,080
Today we have gathered here to do the Guru Puja, again.

63
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,240
The reason is we have got a Guru Principle within ourselves

64
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,240
as I told you last time

65
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,280
and also I have given elaborately

66
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,640
the Ten Commandments as expressed within us

67
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,120
which are describing the different

68
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,440
the different types of essences within us.

69
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,400
The essence of Guru Puja has to be awakened within us.

70
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,480
That's how we are having this program here.

71
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,720
Now it is important

72
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:29,040
that we have to establish

73
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,320
the dharma within us.

74
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,920
Without the dharma you cannot have the ascent.

75
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,000
And as I have told you before that the cleanliness

76
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,160
of your being

77
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,320
depends on how much dharma you follow, religiously.

78
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,280
At the time of Moses

79
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,600
it was worked out

80
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,360
and all the rules and regulations

81
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,880
were created for realized souls.

82
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,480
But as I read in one of the books - it was very good,

83
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,360
because if I had said this, people would not have believed -

84
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,200
that it had to be changed.

85
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,640
I think during the speech the children should not be here,

86
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,560
it's better to take them out.

87
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,600
After the speech you can bring them along - those who make noises.

88
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Those who are quiet it's all right,

89
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,240
but those who are making noises you better bring them out.

90
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,600
If they are going to make noises, better to be out or near the door

91
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,160
so that if they make noises you can get out,

92
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,640
so there is no disturbance.

93
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,920
And during the puja is all right, you could be at the gate,

94
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,600
door or some place from where you can go.

95
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,600
So the laws and regulations that were given to human beings

96
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,640
were actually for the realized souls who would understand.

97
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,800
But when Moses must have discovered the way human beings are,

98
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,080
He must have changed them to very strict rules,

99
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,000
because with human beings as they are,

100
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,560
one has to be extremely strict.

101
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,400
They can't understand anything but fear.

102
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,280
If you have

103
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,760
a stick in your hand, you can put them right.

104
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,400
Without that stick human beings won't listen.

105
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,320
They are only all right if there's a fear.

106
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,440
Now if you see

107
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,000
the today condition of all the nations,

108
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,880
those who are having leaders, or prime ministers, or presidents

109
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,280
they are all people extremely strict,

110
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,920
very dominating and very dry.

111
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,720
And normally people like such people.

112
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,240
Even Hitler succeeded because of that nature.

113
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,120
So the character of a guru so far

114
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,320
has been of a very strict nature

115
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,840
for people who are not realized.

116
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,200
Normally a guru doesn't - a good guru, Satguru,

117
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,400
He doesn't like to talk to people much.

118
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,720
They throw stones

119
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,520
or they don't like to talk to people

120
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,040
who are not realized.

121
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,600
But if they are realized then these Gurus change their attitude

122
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,400
towards the people who want to see them.

123
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,320
There is a tremendous difference

124
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,760
between a person who is a realized and non-realized

125
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,240
in the protocol of God.

126
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,600
A man may be the king or anything, he'll be asked to sit outside.

127
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,960
It has nothing to do with what position you enjoy.

128
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,400
As long as he is a realized soul and not possessed

129
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,160
he is given the highest position.

130
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,120
But if you are possessed then also the Guru will tell him

131
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,640
that "You get out from here,

132
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,840
first get rid of your possession and then come."

133
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
And all these strict rules were there,

134
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,800
that such and such person must be killed,

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,400
such and such person must be given a punishment

136
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,800
of cutting the hands, cutting the feet,

137
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,240
even absolutely destroying the eyes.

138
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,120
This was done because they were not realized souls.

139
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,320
It was the great realization of Moses, I think,

140
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,320
that He took to another kind of law which is known as Sharia now

141
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,600
and that's what the Muslims are following.

142
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,520
In a way it's good I think,

143
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,040
because people who are now normal people really deserve such a rule,

144
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,480
but it should not be so fanatical that you cannot discriminate

145
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,480
between a realized soul and a non-realized soul.

146
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,080
Now the Guru within you

147
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,480
will be awakened if you are strict with yourself.

148
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,680
That's one point is very important.

149
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,280
Unless and until you are strict with yourself

150
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,040
the Guru will not be awakened within you.

151
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,640
People who are lazy lumps, who cannot sacrifice anything,

152
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,960
who are very fond of comfort can never be gurus, take it from Me.

153
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,000
They can be good administrators, they can be anything,

154
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,640
but never a guru.

155
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,240
A guru should be willing to live the way he has to live.

156
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,320
He should be able to sleep on stones,

157
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,360
he should be able to sleep under any circumstances.

158
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,920
Not that the disciple should force on him,

159
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,240
but it should be his own nature, that he can adjust himself.

160
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,360
Comfort cannot crawl on a guru.

161
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,840
Now those who want your Guru Principle to be awakened

162
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,240
must know that you should not ask for comfort.

163
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,760
Even for a thing like that, yesterday you saw the dancing,

164
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,560
one has to do real tapasya.

165
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,800
Intensive tapasya you have to do,

166
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,600
you cannot learn even a thing like dancing

167
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,800
without going into a penance about it.

168
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,080
So a guru has to go through all penances is important.

169
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,280
Sahaja Yogi need not go, but a guru Sahaja Yogi has to do it.

170
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,600
We have to have penances,

171
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,040
and the penance can be any kind of desire you have.

172
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,640
Say, supposing you are very fond of food,

173
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,680
just don't eat the food that you want to eat.

174
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,280
If you are very fond of sweet food,

175
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,440
then eat something very bitter, raised to power hundred and eight.

176
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,120
And if you are fond of some sort of a very ...

177
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,080
- as Indians are, sometimes -

178
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,560
... very spicy food then eat so bland the food, without salt.

179
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,280
Teach your tongue to behave itself.

180
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,720
It doesn't behoove a guru to put his attention to food.

181
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,800
I have seen some of the Sahaja Yogis, they are all right

182
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,480
when the food is there, quite concentrated,

183
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,160
but when it comes to the programme they have no concentration.

184
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,600
Such a sad thing, such people cannot be gurus. They can be cooks, good,

185
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,520
or could be food-tasters or something like that.

186
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,080
Will suit them better, but if they have to be gurus

187
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,800
they must learn to control their tongue and their desires.

188
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,600
I mean, fasting is a good thing for such people, fasting is very good.

189
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,360
All the time they are worried, what are we going to have for lunch,

190
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,360
what are we going to have for dinner?

191
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,600
Such people cannot have their Guru Principle awakened,

192
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,080
neither they can be gurus. So please be careful.

193
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,160
The guru must have control over the tongue.

194
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,440
He must know when to get angry

195
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,120
and when to be gentle.

196
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,840
He must know what to say when,

197
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,760
how much to say.

198
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,640
That's why many gurus have been more effective by not speaking.

199
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,560
Silence is the best way you can help others,

200
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,600
but when it comes to explaining Sahaja Yoga, you should speak.

201
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,760
But I have seen with some people they are very eloquent

202
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,200
when it comes to nonsensical things,

203
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,360
but when it comes to Sahaja Yoga, they don't know anything

204
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,080
about Sahaja Yoga.

205
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,880
So you have to be the master of Sahaja Yoga,

206
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,680
if you have to be a Guru,

207
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,440
not only in talking, but in your behaviour, in everything.

208
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,480
And the karamat

209
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,760
is the ...

210
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,360
I don't know if you use charismatic-word, charismatic they call it

211
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,320
or you say, the one how to do it

212
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,400
how to raise the Kundalini, how to put it at the Sahasrara,

213
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,800
how to break the Sahasrara, all these things you must know,

214
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,680
how to spend your knowledge is viniyoga in Sanskrit.

215
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,640
Guru principle is awakened in a person

216
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,920
when he himself has achieved something.

217
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,320
Imagine a half-baked guru going along talking as a Guru.

218
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,040
He'll end up as a disciple ultimately.

219
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,960
So you have to be master of your own,

220
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,520
but when the Guru Principle comes in

221
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,520
you have to give it to others,

222
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,640
it's a question of giving it to others.

223
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,360
So you have to be at a higher level to give it to others,

224
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,040
have to be at a very high level.

225
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,600
If you are attached to money, if you are attached to food,

226
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,240
if you are attached to mundane things of life, you cannot give.

227
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,600
Now the higher state than that can be achieved,

228
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,240
which is naturally in Me, but can be achieved,

229
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,400
is that you don't have to have any dependence like that,

230
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,920
that any rules and regulations,

231
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,600
like saying that I will have no worry about food,

232
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,520
I should fast, this, that -

233
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,440
it all ends up. When you eat but don't eat,

234
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,680
that's the state one should have,

235
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,400
that you are eating the food

236
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,800
and if you ask, "Did you have your lunch?"

237
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,800
"I don't know ..."

238
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,160
"Will you have your lunch?"

239
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,960
"I don't know ..."

240
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:18,160
Absolutely indifferent to the problems of the body.

241
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,200
"Where did you sleep?"

242
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,320
"I don't know ..."

243
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,680
"What did you eat, what will you have?"

244
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,560
"I don't know ..."

245
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,320
This kind of a state is called ateeta state where you go beyond

246
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,520
and whatever you do, you are doing it

247
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,440
because it is to be done. Without paying any attention to it,

248
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,040
is automatic.

249
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,840
Nothing is important, but this is -

250
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,240
before becoming ateeta you have to steady yourself,

251
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,440
"Nothing is important," you see, is a, avir bhava

252
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,000
they call it, is a kind of a drama you have to put in.

253
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,080
"Oh, nothing is important, this carpet is not important,

254
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,920
I should try to sleep on the cement."

255
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,600
First you have to do that.

256
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,480
But after some time it happens

257
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,320
that you don't remember whether you slept on the cement

258
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,600
or on a cot, "Where did I sleep? I don't know."

259
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,000
That is the ateeta state.

260
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,320
And that state is to be achieved now by many Sahaja Yogis-

261
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,760
in a state where you go beyond.

262
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,520
Say there is somebody who is before you and you have to get angry.

263
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,040
All right, you give them left, right, left, right nicely

264
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,040
and then you are smiling next moment.

265
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,920
Did you get angry with that person? "I don't know, did I?"

266
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,680
Like Buddha once said something

267
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,080
in one village

268
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,080
and there was a horrible fellow who got up

269
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,960
and said lots of things to him.

270
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,720
And when He went to the next village the fellow felt

271
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,760
that "Oh, I should not have done that," Left Vishuddi, perhaps.

272
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,040
So he went down and said, "I am sorry Sir, I have said so

273
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,800
and I should not have said it,

274
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,560
I didn't know You are the enlightened one,

275
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,280
so it happened, so forgive me."

276
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,200
He said "When, where did you say?"

277
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,160
He said, "In the last village."

278
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,600
"Oh, everything in the last village I have left there alone

279
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,640
I don't take with me."

280
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,400
That is the ateeta state that you have to reach.

281
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,160
So even not to feel, it's not important.

282
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,840
These identifications when they drop out completely

283
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,800
then you are doing things in akarma state,

284
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,400
where, like sun is shining it doesn't know it is shining.

285
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,680
When the vibrations are flowing you don't know it is flowing.

286
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,240
Already it has started working in you.

287
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,800
You are surprised, you raise the hands and the Kundalini is rising.

288
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,000
You don't know you are raising the Kundalini actually.

289
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,840
How do you raise it?

290
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,240
You don't know, that's it.

291
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,360
That state has already started ateeta in you,

292
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,200
but get it established in every walk of life,

293
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,080
everything, that you go beyond.

294
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,120
And if you can manage that,

295
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,320
that's the highest that you have to reach.

296
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,960
Now with the incarnations it's very different,

297
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,200
it's the other way round.

298
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,840
Everything is the other way round.

299
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,960
They don't have to do any tapasya.

300
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,520
They don't have to starve, they don't have to cleanse themselves,

301
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,480
whatever they do is the punya.

302
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,120
They don't have to collect punyas either.

303
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,960
If they kill somebody it is dharma.

304
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,320
If they hit somebody it is the dharma.

305
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,040
Nothing they do wrong.

306
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,240
They are absolutely immaculate.

307
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,760
If they deceive someone, they cheat someone,

308
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,280
it's perfectly all right.

309
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,080
Because for a higher goal you have to give up the smaller goals.

310
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,160
It's justified in our day-to-day life you'll see,

311
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,960
that when you are defending your country,

312
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,280
there is an enemy on you, if you have to defend your country

313
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,880
you can slay him.

314
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,840
You can cheat him, diplomatically you can befool him.

315
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,680
Is allowed, why?

316
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,120
Because for a higher goal you have to give up the smaller goal.

317
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,880
But for an incarnation it is always the higher goal.

318
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,280
He is not bothered about smaller goals at all.

319
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,040
He doesn't have to weigh, think, rationalize

320
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,680
or to train himself or do some drama or anything, it's all done.

321
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,520
Even the movement, every movement, every movement of an incarnation

322
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,720
has a ripple in it, which is for the good.

323
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,960
There is nothing, not even a moment is such

324
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,640
which is not for the good of the world.

325
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,240
So the incarnation is a very different thing,

326
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,640
that is not to be achieved, that has to be.

327
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
Now for example

328
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,040
the incarnation is the bhokta, is the enjoyer,

329
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,160
He is the enjoyer of everything.

330
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,320
Many people, say, have created,

331
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,200
now we have a carpet here from Turkey.

332
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,080
These carpets were created by Turkish peoples

333
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,320
some time back for an incarnation to sit.

334
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,480
So the ritambhara pragya will bring it round in such a way

335
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,240
that at least I see it,

336
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,000
or I have it,

337
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,800
so that their souls will be blessed,

338
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,520
so that they feel nice.

339
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,200
Like Michelangelo has made that not for popes, I can tell you.

340
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,640
and not for all the rubbish people who go there.

341
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,320
Neither Blake did all that work

342
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,160
for the useless people who want to go and see nude artists.

343
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,360
It was all done for the incarnation to see.

344
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,520
That's the way they have blessed the most,

345
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,720
because they are beyond, nothing touches them, nothing is important,

346
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,640
but it's not rational or anything that they have trained themselves,

347
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,640
but it is automatically they have.

348
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,040
Like Shri Krishna had to marry sixteen thousand women.

349
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,400
Can you imagine?

350
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,880
In those days of monogamy he would be prosecuted hundred times.

351
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,240
The reason was he has sixteen thousand powers

352
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,000
and He was to be born

353
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,560
with those sixteen thousand powers on this Earth

354
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,200
and five elements became His queens.

355
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:37,200
He had to do some justification to have them around.

356
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,960
And as I have now Sahaja Yogis whom I have,

357
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,040
I mean, given Realization.

358
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,440
So automatically I am your Mother, is established.

359
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,480
But for Him there was no way out

360
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,400
but to marry His sixteen thousand powers.

361
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,720
And so He married, but He was never married,

362
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,800
He was a bachelor out and out all His life.

363
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,920
Because He is Yogeshwara and He is a brahmacharya.

364
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,600
Who can marry ... Him?

365
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,880
So for Them all these worldly things are just a drama,

366
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,120
has no meaning at all.

367
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,720
It's just a drama.

368
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,120
A person

369
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:40,400
who is not an incarnation should not try to be.

370
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,960
That's not the right of a human being.

371
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,640
Like a policeman standing on the road,

372
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,200
if he puts his hands right, left - we follow it.

373
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,720
But you ask some mad man to go and stand there, he will be arrested.

374
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,480
So for normal people, even you are a guru

375
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,360
you shouldn't allow them to touch your feet.

376
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,400
Only an incarnation's feet must be touched

377
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,120
and nobody else's feet must be touched.

378
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,120
Of course in samayachara

379
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,400
like as we have in India the custom to touch the feet of the father,

380
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,560
but because the father is a representative of the father

381
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,040
in you, that's why - or the mother.

382
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,240
But that's symbolic,

383
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,920
but in reality you are not to surrender yourself to anybody else,

384
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,280
but to an incarnation.

385
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,240
Also if there's a teacher in your,

386
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,480
any art or in anyway the master, you must touch his feet.

387
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,840
Even to take his name you have to pull your ears.

388
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,600
But nobody

389
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,960
who is a human being should make touch your feet,

390
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,720
especially the Sahaja Yogis should not.

391
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,200
Nobody should ask anyone to touch your feet.

392
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,360
As an elder you may,

393
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,840
that's a different point, but not as a guru.

394
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,320
Is a very dangerous thing,

395
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,360
once you start it, you know what it happens, with so many,

396
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,880
they have just gone out of Sahaja Yoga.

397
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,640
So to develop the Guru Principle within you

398
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,760
first of all you must develop yourself, fully.

399
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,480
Now how to develop yourself a Guru Principle, one must see.

400
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,960
We have got the ten principles within you, as I told you before

401
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,760
and we should develop these all ten principles in such a way,

402
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,640
that we stand out from others.

403
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,920
Yesterday as I told you that when we do dhyana-dharana-samadhi

404
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,640
and achieve the blessings of the ritambhara pragya,

405
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,360
then put that whole thing

406
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,960
onto different areas

407
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,120
as called as desh or bhoomi.

408
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,440
How you spend them is the point - is through mantras,

409
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,320
cleanse it through mantras,

410
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,880
cleanse it through your attention,

411
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:30,120
every day you must know which chakra to be cleared out.

412
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,960
You must know about yourself, where is the problem,

413
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,840
how it is to be cleansed,

414
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,960
how we have to clear it out.

415
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,400
Do not take it for granted.

416
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,960
Many people who have got, say, left-sided problem,

417
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,160
you will just bring them lemon and chillis

418
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,160
and think that Mother has done the job.

419
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,080
I can only do the job temporarily,

420
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,480
but if there is a vacuum again you will suck in.

421
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,360
You see ...

422
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,600
these vacuums within you feel hungry again to have some more.

423
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,320
So to take out that vacuum is your job

424
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,040
and for that you have to religiously get

425
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,720
after all your defects.

426
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,920
That's the most important thing for all of you.

427
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,800
And try to put full attention to all these different deshas

428
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,160
- is the nations, they are called like this.

429
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,040
And once you have cleared it,

430
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,240
it is enlightened, is full of light,

431
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,720
then you call it pradesh,

432
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,920
means the desha has been enlightened.

433
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,760
Once that has achieved

434
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,920
then you have reached the point you can become a guru,

435
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,920
but still you are not a Satguru.

436
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,160
To become the Satguru you must achieve the state of ateeta.

437
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,040
The ateeta state is such

438
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:05,200
that the person who is not a good man will tremble before you.

439
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,720
A man who is a liar,

440
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,160
who has cheated others will lose his tongue.

441
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,680
A man who has adulterous eyes,

442
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:26,040
who is a man without, no control,

443
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,400
without any control over his mind

444
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,440
as far as the women are concerned or men are concerned,

445
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,080
such a person will have shaking in his eyes.

446
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,120
Some of them will shake,

447
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,640
those who have been possessed will be shaking with it.

448
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,040
They'll be all exposed before the light of a Sat Guru.

449
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,640
When you achieve that you don't have to fight them,

450
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,400
they will themselves be exposed

451
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,640
and you won't have to do anything.

452
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,840
One day I was told

453
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,440
that there is a servant, lady-servant

454
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,320
who is a very possessed person, in the family.

455
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,160
So I said "Get rid of her."

456
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,280
I went to the airport. On My way I stopped at that house

457
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,440
and the maid-servant just walked in, you see

458
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,640
and there was a big gutter flowing,

459
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,960
I mean not a gutter but a open sort of a thing

460
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,440
and she saw Me and she fell in that.

461
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,520
I said, "Oh God,"

462
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,280
so I told the driver to take the car a little ahead.

463
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,880
And she fell in. It happens.

464
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
I was traveling by plane one day

465
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,440
and the gentleman in front started just jumping.

466
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,680
So a Sahaja Yogi asked, "Are you from TM?" He said, "How do you know?"

467
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,480
He said, "We know." So I sat back.

468
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,200
It may be they may all have ...

469
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,920
A day may come when they might start jumping like that.

470
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,040
Or a pilot might start jumping.

471
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,200
It's a big problem for Me.

472
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,200
Even the lights ...

473
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,400
... you enter into a church

474
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,760
and suddenly you find all the lights going off like this.

475
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,840
Even in big banquets, I find, when I am sitting there

476
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,560
and suddenly everybody comes and sit down

477
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,920
and all their bhoots come around,

478
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,680
they start jumping and then people start looking, "What's happening,

479
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,760
is there a fire on?"

480
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,760
So many things can happen,

481
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,520
like there was a gentleman very much possessed in a war

482
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,360
and we were going to a ship

483
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,840
and there was a little  platform on which we had to first jump

484
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,320
and the platform started doing like this, like that

485
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,120
and the fellow didn't know what to do with it,

486
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,040
he didn't understand why it was doing this.

487
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,560
So when you reach that state you don't have to argue or do anything,

488
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,720
even if you lift your eye

489
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,600
it happens that the person gets into problems.

490
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,040
Or there could be some ego-oriented people, they'll melt down.

491
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,200
First you have to do the drama of a guru,

492
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,080
dress up in a way which is simple,

493
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,840
you have to behave in a way which is very gentle,

494
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,360
because you have to attract them.

495
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,320
"Come along, come along, come along."

496
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,880
That's advertising, Advertising Department.

497
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,440
And once it is done, that drama is done

498
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,880
it can be exposed very soon, if they will find out that you are not good,

499
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,120
you are just a dramatist.

500
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,480
Once the drama has been done then

501
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,800
very cleverly you can bring out your real self before them.

502
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,480
So first you don't show them that you are a real, hard taskmaster.

503
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,400
Never.

504
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,320
First use all your sweet qualities.

505
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,920
The more they are difficult the more I am gentle with them.

506
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,520
Then they come inside.

507
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,640
Then you put to the mill and you can cure them.

508
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,560
First prepare them. First of all sometimes they are so frightened,

509
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,360
they are so nervous, they are so upset, sometimes too much of ego.

510
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,880
So be gentle.

511
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,760
Gradually they'll strengthen themselves also in your company

512
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,640
and then, even if you hit them they are all right.

513
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,320
That's how it has to be done very cleverly.

514
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:55,040
and if you see the way I manage My Gurudom

515
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,720
you can also manage.

516
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,760
But the key to Guru is patience,

517
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,520
a complete patience and complete dependence on God Almighty.

518
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,640
That's the key, complete patience.

519
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,640
First you tell them that this should be such,

520
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,760
but they will not accept. They will argue -

521
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,320
how, why, this, that. All right, go ahead.

522
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,800
Then they will come back with a black eye.

523
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,960
Or they may come back with a punched nose.

524
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,520
Then you say, "All right, I'll soothe it down." You soothe it down,

525
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,240
and then tell them.

526
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,240
So is the wisdom, the discretion of Yogeshwara you should have.

527
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,040
How to deal with people is very important,

528
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,440
why I say Yogeshwara.

529
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,600
Because at the guru state you have to give it on a collective level.

530
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Individual level finishes and you jump into collective,

531
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,720
once you start becoming a guru.

532
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:08,440
So all these methods which I explained the other day to Modi,

533
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:16,120
you can understand that the ten of

534
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,280
your problems at the void

535
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,040
- once solved -

536
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,880
you solve the sixteen problems of the Vishuddhi.

537
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,960
And once sixteen problems are crossed you come to Agnya.

538
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,760
And at the Agnya Chakra

539
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,160
there is such a tremendous sacrifice

540
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,080
without feeling the sacrifice, is awaiting.

541
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,000
And one has to see what you can sacrifice

542
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,600
in that ateeta state, because you don't sacrifice anything.

543
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:08,880
Everything is already sacrificed, what is there to sacrifice?

544
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,640
And such a state should be achieved

545
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,280
by realizing that you are realized souls.

546
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
You are not ordinary people

547
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,640
and you cannot have ordinary,

548
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,360
mundane types

549
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,040
of rules and regulations.

550
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,520
Like yama and nyama,

551
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,440
the nyamas are for yourself, yamas for others, nothing.

552
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,120
There should be absolute truths with you.

553
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,480
So much so that you should manifest them

554
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,440
and all these truths have powers.

555
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,400
By every truth that is within you established,

556
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,160
you don't have to do anything, they work out themselves.

557
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,640
So first of all you must get your chakras all right.

558
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,840
On the chakras you must put your attention.

559
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,200
After the samadhi state you will start opening them out properly.

560
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,760
Clear them out. Know what are the chakras that are bad.

561
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,680
I have seen people who have very bad few chakras

562
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,960
and many good chakras,

563
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,920
but they will be only enjoying the good chakras

564
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,000
and will not worry about the bad ones.

565
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,760
Pay attention to your bad chakras, cleanse them, cleanse them.

566
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,920
Put all your attention to that.

567
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,760
Put the attention of the God,

568
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,360
of the Deity whom you worship

569
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,200
and you'll get the ...

570
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,400
... complete manifestation of their power within yourself.

571
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,040
So clear all the chakras,

572
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,560
all the pradeshas to be established

573
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,680
and after the establishment of the pradeshas

574
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,080
you'll have to establish the rapport with others

575
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,240
on the collective level.

576
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,760
Then a state when you become a complete spirit at the Agnya Chakra.

577
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,880
It's a, easiest in Sahaja Yoga and I have told

578
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,680
you the reason, because you are such fortunate people.

579
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,240
The easiest of easiest is Sahaja Yoga.

580
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,920
The essence of Sahaja Yoga is that it's the easiest thing to do.

581
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:56,720
And that is why we should take full

582
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,080
advantage of that easiest method,

583
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,720
made easy, absolutely for you.

584
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,440
This is the blessing of Guru Puja for you

585
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:18,640
that you all should become gurus by next year.

586
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,680
Just you have to dedicate and say today in your heart,

587
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,880
to promise Me in your heart that Mother, not we'll try but we will be

588
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,280
and thrice you should say, "We will be, we will be."

589
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,640
Now last of all I want to tell you

590
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,960
that now I have completed My sixtieth year

591
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,520
and no more celebrations of My birthday, this is the last.

592
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,920
Please remember this.

593
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,680
I have accepted whatever you said,

594
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,120
because of sixtieth birthday is very auspicious.

595
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:18,160
After this no more celebration of My sixtieth birthday.

596
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:42,240
You have already thought of giving Me some present

597
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,000
from all Europeans.

598
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,400
On the sixtieth birthday I have accepted,

599
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,960
but no more of this kind of planning should be done anymore

600
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,320
for the sixtieth birthday, which is over now.

601
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,960
I am telling you very frankly, all right?

602
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,560
So nobody is going to celebrate My sixtieth birthday anymore.

603
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,040
I hope it's clear to you.

604
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,960
So the protocol

605
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,920
of the Guru and the Mother

606
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:35,720
is to be understood in Sahaja Yoga mostly by experiencing it.

607
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,800
But that doesn't mean

608
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:43,120
that you go out of the way to experience the other side of it.

609
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,400
By being protocolish more and more

610
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:54,040
you will find you will receive much more help.

611
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,160
Like Nick one day I told him, he will tell you that,

612
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,680
there were two ladies who wanted to go to Belgium.

613
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,600
I told them they are going tomorrow.

614
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,680
And the ladies said, "No, we are going today."

615
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,800
He said, "The Mother has said that you are going tomorrow,

616
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,440
so you go tomorrow, whatever it is."

617
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,760
They said, "No, we are going today.

618
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,720
How is it Mother has said that we are going tomorrow?"

619
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,880
He said, "But She said it" -  they wouldn't listen.

620
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,960
So we sent them to the airport

621
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,200
and they found they had to go next day.

622
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,720
So that is how it is, that the protocol should be that,

623
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,800
"Yes, Mother has said it, doesn't matter.

624
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,680
It may go wrong, doesn't matter.

625
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,280
Whatever She says, let's obey and see."

626
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,200
By experiencing only you will know,

627
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,760
but in the beginning only you will say,

628
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,360
"No, we'll not do this and that," - it's not good.

629
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:55,200
So the protocol is the simplest of simple to do,

630
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,240
So that's the essence of Sahaja Yoga,

631
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,080
the simplest of the simple is the protocol.

632
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,560
If you understand the protocol

633
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,480
you don't have to do anything, you will grow by it automatically.

634
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,720
But you lack in protocol and that's how you do not grow.

635
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,160
This is the point is, that to grow best in Sahaja Yoga

636
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,040
is to know the protocol, which you can ask others.

637
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,720
With experienced people you can ask,

638
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,160
or if you want to have your own experience you can have.

639
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,200
But some people try the other way round, like answering Me back,

640
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,600
by saying all kinds of things

641
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,240
they think "Let's experiment what happens."

642
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,920
And then they break their necks and come to Me for curing.

643
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,760
So that should not happen. Experience should be for betterment.

644
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,880
And that's how if you can ask others, take their advice,

645
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,240
those people who are rising higher then normal,

646
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,200
what is the protocol?

647
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,560
And put your attention to it, how can you improve your protocol,

648
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,360
what should we do to observe protocol,

649
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,240
what wrong are we doing, where are we going wrong?

650
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,160
Because the essence of Sahaja Yoga today is the protocol,

651
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,920
which should be the simplest.

652
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,840
Should be the simplest thing to do

653
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,160
and once you know the protocol that "If She has said it,

654
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,240
if it is meant, then it's all right."

655
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,600
But some people are so funny

656
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,720
that they start using Me as a quotation.

657
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,920
"Mother has said everybody must fast."

658
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,080
I told somebody that "You'd better fast."

659
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,240
So a thin man comes next day fainting, I said, "What happened?"

660
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,200
When I say something to a particular person they just circulate it,

661
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,480
because they think, "Why should I fast alone, everybody must fast."

662
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,880
Is a big problem, that they always quote Me.

663
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,800
Nobody is to quote Me to others,

664
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,640
because one thing is important,

665
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,720
whatever you have to say you put it on the notice board

666
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:17,800
maybe with My signature, better - for general things.

667
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,600
and for particular whatever I say, you should do it for particular.

668
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,760
At least that much discretion we all should have.

669
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,440
And try. You'll be very much helped,

670
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,120
you will be surprised, you'll be very much helped,

671
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,640
because it is for, everything is for your betterment

672
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,160
and a special grace,

673
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,520
if you understand the essence of protocol.

674
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,840
So I am taking you to that point

675
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,720
where you'll start understanding

676
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,880
that nothing is to be surrendered to Mother as such,

677
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,040
because She doesn't take anything, nothing goes to Her.

678
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,120
Is only your surrendering yourself,

679
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:04,641
by leaving all that is not wanted.

680
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,440
It's a very beautifying process which one should take.

681
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,760
You all have come up so much and you have to grow very much further,

682
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,840
I am sure you will go ahead and will become great Gurus

683
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:26,240
as you have promised today, by next year.
