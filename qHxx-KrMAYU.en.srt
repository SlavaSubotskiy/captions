2
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:24,800
now then we have another Center on top

3
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,770
which we called as the heart center it

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,930
is in the center now in the sternum bone

5
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:33,200
behind the sternum bone this Center is

6
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:36,559
there and time time us produces the

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,120
antibodies in your sternum bone these

8
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,829
antibodies later on fight your diseases

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,110
when you are about 12 years of age did

10
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:50,720
they go into the whole body and waiting

11
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:53,329
there for a signal from your sternum

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,950
bone that means supposing you see

13
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:57,649
something you get frightened this bone

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:59,420
starts pulsating when it pulsates the

15
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:03,460
antibodies know there's some emergency

16
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:06,469
and they get prepared for it now this is

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:09,590
such a normal thing to happen to people

18
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:12,320
but insecurities car can be of the worst

19
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,450
time and when these insecurities they

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,829
were developed people can develop all

21
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,319
kinds of diseases of the lungs

22
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:21,200
especially the women develop what you

23
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,179
call as the breast cancer mostly these

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,670
women are insecure maybe their husbands

25
00:01:23,179 --> 00:01:26,990
are not good or they feel that the

26
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,159
husband may leave them alone or

27
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,869
something like that

28
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,909
there are certainly insecurities that

29
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:35,060
are built in they might be quite

30
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:37,490
frightening personalities I've seen most

31
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,439
of the air hostesses have this central

32
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,389
heart catch it because they are afraid

33
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,369
they may miss the play you know I don't

34
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:47,299
know they have to be on the job and run

35
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:50,270
and do mostly this time-bound jobs cause

36
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:52,999
you a trouble here of the center heart

37
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:55,340
and this Center heart is very important

38
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:57,439
because for women specially they have to

39
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,329
be secured if their motherhood is

40
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,909
challenged then they are even worse and

41
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:04,340
this is how one has to understand a

42
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:07,039
woman should be very much respected if

43
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,289
she is your wife is your child or

44
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,080
anything she has to be respected and

45
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:14,120
given all the security is the woman who

46
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,400
makes the society is the movement who

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,340
creates the children the woman who looks

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,980
after this so the men have to give all

49
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,129
the security and the protection

50
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,379
- the women hood and understand that is

51
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:28,810
a very important factor which we

52
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:31,599
phenolate we can have lots of problems

53
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,910
with our society and the women will

54
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,590
start competing with men and then the

55
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,590
society will be all dislocated

56
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:46,230
[Music]

57
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,440
if there's any problem with your father

58
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:53,069
in the right side caches and it gives

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,720
you ask them first of all you are we can

60
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:56,790
save vulnerable to ask them are you too

61
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,069
bad liver plus if you have problems with

62
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,140
your father or eat with your father

63
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,300
supposing you are unhappy father or

64
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,250
maybe that you are not looking after

65
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,310
your children then you get the center

66
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,739
got a very bad thing it can happen to

67
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,910
any one of us if a man is unkind to

68
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:17,489
assume it's a father principle if the

69
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,819
son is unkind to the father so the

70
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:24,090
father is hurt it's the father principle

71
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:26,880
if it is disturbed by any chance or a

72
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:30,959
suddenly father dies and you feel the

73
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,000
pinch of that all your life all that can

74
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,410
work out here and you get this right

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,959
heart catch with that you get a stoma it

76
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,730
is said that in homeopathic they believe

77
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,830
that with more tension you get because

78
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,319
when if you have more tense you see you

79
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,970
remember your father if he was yet he

80
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,209
would have met you in the subconscious

81
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:57,870
some time signals and that's how it adds

82
00:03:51,209 --> 00:04:01,140
to the it is so simple to work out that

83
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,049
could be amazed that if you have to just

84
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,180
raise the principle of father in a

85
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,670
person like that who might be dejected

86
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,380
father who might be a cruel father who

87
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,829
might be a son who has lost the father

88
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:17,239
can be anything that you have to just

89
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:17,239
put your hand on that part

00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:30,350
[Music]

91
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:33,490
left-hand side of this is the essence of

92
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,490
Mother Nature

93
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:44,260
if in your childhood your mother had

94
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:49,490
played a role which has given you fear

95
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:52,370
or kind of a frightening experience then

96
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:57,410
this Center goes out we say the left

97
00:04:52,370 --> 00:05:01,070
heart attack but damn if you are a bad

98
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:03,440
mother all through youth like that the

99
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:07,640
center is very important on the left

100
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,170
hand side is the mother's side and the

101
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,960
mother itself

102
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:14,870
the mother is a lunatic you get a

103
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,000
problem there you might get it we find a

104
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,680
heart there are two hearts one is the

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,060
heart of the spirit and one is the heart

106
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:25,850
chakra if a mother is affinity is she's

107
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,860
a woman who is very fanatic about her

108
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,560
food things like that when the children

109
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,810
get it it's a dangerous thing to play

110
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,150
with children like that to have complete

111
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,670
discipline on the children and just give

112
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:40,370
them must walk straight like a horse for

113
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,080
two things children should be allowed to

114
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,000
have their freedom actually when we

115
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,040
suppress them too much they become

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,800
Milligan's that way Indians are better

117
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,330
they know how to bring up their children

118
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,090
with this cruelty towards children I

119
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:55,010
don't know what women are up to we're

120
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,830
not going to take their figures and

121
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:03,550
their duties and everything in front of

122
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:07,040
God such cruelty exists such

123
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,960
self-centeredness then with all this the

124
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,310
children develop this trouble and they

125
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:16,550
have palpitations

126
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:18,470
they have very weak hearts or when the

127
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,250
children are not nice to the mother they

128
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,010
also get it

129
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:25,030
so mother and father are very important

130
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:27,290
factors in sahaja yoga and you have to

131
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:30,140
understand that if your parents have

132
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:32,330
been unkind to you you must forgive them

133
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,569
just forget about them because they have

134
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,279
given you birth

135
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:38,460
should be thankful and just forget about

136
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:42,229
them that's the best way to get over the

137
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,229
problem of left and right heart

138
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:51,929
so I've explained to you all these

139
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:56,939
things now this is the heart in the

140
00:06:51,929 --> 00:07:02,539
heart resides the spirit the spirit is

141
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:02,539
watching the game of this creation

142
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:11,189
it is watching what is happening to this

143
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:12,860
person this person to this person to

144
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:17,159
this person

145
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:22,289
everybody has got in their heart the

146
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:24,389
spirit which is watching is called as

147
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:31,169
the shaker you mean the one the knower

148
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:34,050
of the field you know what where you go

149
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:37,499
what we states to create you watch he

150
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:40,580
doesn't interfere if you only the

151
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:43,169
interference comes from here from that

152
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:47,069
which tries to give you conscience which

153
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:50,189
tries to improve you from here sometimes

154
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:52,319
to become part it tries to tell you be

155
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:56,519
in the center by punishing you by

156
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,639
showing it is wrong but he is that

157
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:04,849
watching the game let's see how far it

158
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:10,559
goes he is the knower of your teeth

159
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:12,689
he is the universal green video he the

160
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:18,809
reflection of that God Almighty is a

161
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:22,499
spectator within and his power is this

162
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:28,669
all-pervading power which has created

163
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:33,659
all so to fill this all-pervading power

164
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:35,579
you have to become the spirit all this

165
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:39,209
creation has no meaning if you do not

166
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:42,539
become listed in the Vegas of first the

167
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:44,709
very first anger says that by reading

168
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:47,630
Vedas if you do not be

169
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:50,390
we believe with waiting what comes on

170
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:53,060
whether we the means to know if you do

171
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:57,649
not become the knowledge that it has

172
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:59,839
don't that's the question you are

173
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:02,500
talking about the spirit being in the

174
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,120
heart chakra there over on the left side

175
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,670
I'd like to know why it's on the left

176
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,010
instead of in the middle because if the

177
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,870
spirit is has to do with realization why

178
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,390
isn't it in the middle and central

179
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,730
Kundalini instead of on inside like that

180
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:19,190
and why is it

181
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:23,029
whining that much yeah I guess the main

182
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:25,070
thing they not that's the last one's

183
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:29,570
heart stops we don't exist

184
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:32,140
she exists that's the most important of

185
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,140
my god

186
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:43,379
