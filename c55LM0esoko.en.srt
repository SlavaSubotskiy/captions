1
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:42,624
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,280
At the very outset,

3
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,625
we have to know one thing,

4
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,000
that truth is what it is.

5
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,799
We cannot organize it,

6
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:59,480
we cannot order it,

7
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,400
we cannot conceptualize it also, with our human understanding.

8
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,320
It is, it was and it will be.

9
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,680
The essence of all religions,

10
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,200
if you bring it down

11
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,799
to the one-line essence,

12
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:27,999
is this, that "seek the eternal",

13
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,999
and treat the transitory

14
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
with all understanding about it.

15
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,760
The first part is the difficult one:

16
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,320
"seek the eternal".

17
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
Eternal is the truth.

18
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,200
And what is the truth?

19
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:59,799
Now when I'm talking to you, you are all very well-versed and

20
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:02,999
very well-educated people.

21
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,440
I have to request you to have an open mind,

22
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:10,345
a scientific outlook

23
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,320
to see for yourself what I say,

24
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:17,840
is the truth or not,

25
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,160
experience it,

26
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,960
and treat all this talk as a hypothesis.

27
00:06:25,424 --> 00:06:28,944
And if it turns out to be the truth,

28
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:32,328
then in all honesty we have to accept it.

29
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,799
So there are two things

30
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,480
which we may not accept,

31
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,920
but they exist.

32
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,999
One of them is

33
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,999
that all this universe,

34
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,160
all this creation,

35
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,680
is permeated by,

36
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,920
nourished by, looked after by

37
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,799
all-pervading Power of God's love.

38
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:11,999
In these modern times even to take God's name is too much.

39
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,799
This is called as Paramachaitanya in Sanskrit language,

40
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:19,799
in Koran it is called as ruh,

41
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:23,520
in the Bible as the all-pervading Power of God's love,

42
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,760
or the all-pervading Power of Divine.

43
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,040
What we call as spirituality, divinity

44
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,799
is the essence of that.

45
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:35,799
This is first truth.

46
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:38,999
And the second truth is

47
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,640
that we are not this body,

48
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,760
not this mind,

49
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,799
not the emotions,

50
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:53,799
not the ego, nor these thoughts.

51
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:58,800
Beyond that we are the Spirit, we are the pure Spirit.

52
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,200
These are the two things

53
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,320
said in all religions,

54
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,999
whatever way they must have talked about.

55
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,440
In the olden times,

56
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,560
when seeking started in India...

57
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,999
India has certain privileges compared to other countries.

58
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,400
Firstly the climate is so good,

59
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,999
that you can live in a jungle without much trouble.

60
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,520
While in the West we would say

61
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,000
people started going outward, like a tree,

62
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,840
the Indians started going downward into their roots.

63
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,999
And they found out, long time back, Sahaja Yoga.

64
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,999
It's not a modern thing, it's an ancient

65
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,720
[unscripted] method of getting union with the Divine,

66
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,320
which is yoga.

67
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,799
"Sahaja" means "born with you"

68
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:01,799
- "saha" is "with," "ja" "born."

69
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,840
Born with you is the right

70
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,640
to get that union with the divine Power.

71
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,480
But "sahaja" also means "spontaneous,"

72
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,840
because this is the living power

73
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:19,799
that works it out.

74
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:22,999
There is a living power within us,

75
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,000
which has made us

76
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,999
human beings from amoeba stage.

77
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:32,999
And now there's another residual power,

78
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,799
which has to connect us to the Divine.

79
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:39,999
This is the real meaning of the word "yoga."

80
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,999
And every human being has a right

81
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,999
to get united to that all-pervading Power.

82
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,520
So this is the last breakthrough of our evolution.

83
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,280
At human level, as you know, we live in a relative world.

84
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,800
Some people say this is good, some people say that is good.

85
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,680
There's all a strife going on.

86
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,799
But if it is the absolute truth

87
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:08,799
there should be no two opinions about it.

88
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,840
So very humbly we must accept

89
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,799
that we have not yet reached that absolute truth,

90
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:17,360
which proves the existence of God,

91
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,799
which proves the existence of this all-pervading Power,

92
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:23,240
which proves

93
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,480
the correctness of what

94
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,560
the great prophets, the great incarnations

95
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,680
have taught us.

96
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,120
Of course religions have gone into diversions

97
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,160
and deviations because of human effort,

98
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:43,760
and they might have been

99
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:46,840
apparently looking to be different,

100
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,640
but they were just like flowers on the Tree of Life

101
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,480
at different times, according to the timings.

102
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,720
Sanskrit the word is called as "samayachara".

103
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,600
According to the time,

104
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,520
the manifestation was there,

105
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,760
but they were all created on one Tree of Life.

106
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,320
But people plucked it,

107
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,799
started saying, "This is mine. This is mine."

108
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:17,999
and with the dead flowers they started fighting.

109
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,400
That's how we see today the problem arising.

110
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,640
There was nothing wrong with these saints,

111
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,960
nothing wrong with the prophets,

112
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,680
and nothing wrong with the incarnations.

113
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,240
They all have done whatever was the best for us,

114
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,799
and have tried to tell us from time to time

115
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:40,799
at the time of our evolution, what we have to do.

116
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:43,040
But mostly they have been dealing

117
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,440
with the transitory things, how

118
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,960
not to indulge into the transitory pleasures of life,

119
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,999
but to seek the eternal.

120
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:58,999
The second part of it is the "Seek the eternal."

121
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,799
That is, to get this yoga,

122
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:05,680
to be united with this all-pervading Power,

123
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,560
which gives you Self-Realization,

124
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,640
to know the Self.

125
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,880
"Know thy Self" - Christ has said it;

126
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,040
you are to be born again.

127
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,880
Even in Sanskrit language, they call a person who is a realized soul

128
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,799
as "dwijaha," means "born twice."

129
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:28,999
They call a bird also as "dwijaha," meaning "born twice"

130
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,880
- means first it's an egg

131
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,080
and then it becomes a free bird to fly out.

132
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,799
In the same way a "realized soul"

133
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:39,680
means a person, a human being,

134
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,999
who is connected with that all-pervading Power.

135
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,160
Now what is the system within us

136
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,999
which has been created by God Almighty?

137
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,999
Beautifully, because - not that He's our Creator,

138
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,880
but He is our loving Father,

139
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,280
- and beautifully during our evolutionary process,

140
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,600
He has created a very beautiful mechanism within us.

141
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:07,999
I am sorry we don't have any diagram here of that,

142
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,999
but that is described as "Tree of Life" in the Bible,

143
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,799
it's described as "Asas" in Koran,

144
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:18,799
is described as

145
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:23,600
Kundalini in Sanskrit language.

146
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,799
"Kundala" means "coils."

147
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:28,799
Now this power of Kundalini,

148
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:31,640
is the power

149
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,960
which is the power of pure desire.

150
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,960
All other desires are impure.

151
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,720
You know the law of economics is that

152
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,600
in general, wants are not satiable.

153
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,240
Today we want to have a table, then want to have a chair,

154
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,640
then want to have a car, then want to have a house;

155
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,760
whatever we get, we are not satisfied with it.

156
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,440
We jump from one to another.

157
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,880
The reason is, whatever we desire

158
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,640
is not the pure desire.

159
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,880
The pure desire within us, whether you are aware of it or not,

160
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,640
is to become one with the divine Power.

161
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,799
And unless and until this desire is fulfilled,

162
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:18,640
you can never have that satisfaction,

163
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,720
that contentment of a saint.

164
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:27,040
So this is the work one had to do.

165
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,160
In the early days thousands of years back,

166
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,480
all over the world there were realized souls.

167
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,799
We can start right from Abraham,

168
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:42,999
to Moses, to Confucius.

169
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,960
In India there were many great saints, Adi-Nath;

170
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,760
from that nathpanthis they were called as.

171
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:53,960
Their job was just to give awakening to people.

172
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,799
At the time of Rama, His father-in-law

173
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:59,440
was Janaka who was a king,

174
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,799
but regarded as a very detached person, Vaidehi(?).

175
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:10,120
and one disciple came to him, asked him for Self-Realization.

176
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,440
He said, "You can ask for my kingdom,

177
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,799
but it is not easy to give you Self-Realization."

178
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:17,999
He said, "Why?" He said, "The time has not come."

179
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,240
"So when will the time come?" He said, "Kali Yuga"

180
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,999
- that's modern times.

181
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,160
"This is the time when people will be

182
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
living under illusions,

183
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,120
subranth, and they will be

184
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,999
under shock of destruction.

185
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,880
They will not be able to solve their problems,

186
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,960
and then they will

187
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,400
seek the truth.

188
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,799
And many of them who today are roaming about

189
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:53,999
in the hills and dales, in the mountains Himalayas,

190
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,000
will settle down as householders

191
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,999
and they will get their Self-Realization."

192
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,680
That is the time today.

193
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,280
Whatever is said about the Last Judgment,

194
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,799
this is the time for that Last Judgment.

195
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,999
Also in Koran it is said

196
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,799
that "At the time of your Resurrection your hands will speak,

197
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:18,120
and they will give witness against you."

198
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,400
Exactly this happens in Sahaja Yoga.

199
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,080
The surah that is in Koran called as sashti yoga,

200
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,680
it's surprising how Mohammed Sahib clearly said about it.

201
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,040
He also said, "You won't believe it, because you are too arrogant.

202
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,880
Because you won't be able to see that,

203
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,799
you will be moving in another direction of fanaticism."

204
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,720
Clearly He has said it.

205
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,240
But as it is, nobody likes

206
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,640
to really go into the details of it

207
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:51,920
and to find what is between the lines.

208
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,440
That also is a very subtle thing.

209
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,240
For that we have to become subtle beings,

210
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,200
and to become that subtle being

211
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,999
you have to get your Self-realization.

212
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,240
At the time in the beginning, I would say, when they were searching,

213
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:11,999
they went through their sympathetic nervous system,

214
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,040
praying to God or doing their Vedas and all those things.

215
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,080
And what they saw were the different deities

216
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,280
sitting on the different chakras on the subtle centers,

217
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,400
so they started talking about the deities.

218
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,999
So people started worshipping the deities.

219
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,799
They wanted to have

220
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:41,640
the nectar, the honey of the flower,

221
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,280
but they started talking about the flower, worshipping the flower.

222
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,799
So some people afterwards found it

223
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:53,200
that it was not proper, like Buddha, Mahavira,

224
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,960
Mohammed Sahib, Nanaka;

225
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,880
all of them found that it's not proper to talk about the flowers,

226
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,840
because people get lost.

227
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,880
So better talk about the honey.

228
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,799
So one was sakara, that is,

229
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,440
with the form - another formless.

230
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,799
So nirakara, they started talking about the formless.

231
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:16,999
This was also talk, and talk, and talk.

232
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,999
But to reach the honey you have to be a bee,

233
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,999
and that's what is Self-realization is.

234
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,440
Now this Kundalini is placed in the triangular bone,

235
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,999
which is called as "sacrum" in the medical term.

236
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,680
In Latin, "sacrum" means "sacred."

237
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,720
That means the Greeks knew about it,

238
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,880
otherwise why should they call it a sacred bone?

239
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,000
This Kundalini is awakened

240
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,320
as a living process,

241
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,760
like the seed sprouts when it is put in the Mother Earth;

242
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:54,799
spontaneously rises, passes through six centers,

243
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:57,120
the seventh center is below.

244
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,040
And the seventh center is responsible for our excretion.

245
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,440
It stops its function when it starts rising.

246
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,480
So another myth

247
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,360
which says that the sex has any part to play in our ascent

248
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,800
is absolutely wrong,

249
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,040
because the center of sex which is the seventh center

250
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,999
is lower than the Kundalini.

251
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,760
Then it rises, pierces through six centers.

252
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:27,799
And the sixth center is placed on the fontanel bone area,

253
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,520
where it was a soft bone once upon a time.

254
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,040
But as you grow,

255
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,560
through your sympathetic activity

256
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,800
you develop two institutions in your head.

257
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,160
From the right activity which is, we can call

258
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,999
the power of action, you develop your ego like a balloon.

259
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:51,480
And from the left side

260
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,799
which is your conditionings,

261
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:56,280
you develop another balloon

262
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,720
which is called as "superego" in English language,

263
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,720
but in Sanskrit is "mana."

264
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:07,120
Both of them join like this, sometimes overlap each other,

265
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,600
and the bone becomes calcified.

266
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,999
So now you are like an egg, I would say.

267
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,999
Then when the Kundalini rises,

268
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:23,440
when the Kundalini rises, She passes through this center

269
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,999
which is placed between the optic chiasma, known as Agnya Chakra,

270
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,560
which sometimes people call it as "third eye."

271
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,080
And this center sucks in

272
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,799
these two institutions,

273
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:42,999
opening the limbic area,

274
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,720
and through which the Kundalini comes out,

275
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,720
and you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head,

276
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,120
the actualization of the baptism.

277
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,960
It's an actualization, it's not just a certificate.

278
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,920
So, like every instrument has to be connected to the mains,

279
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,999
you get connected with that subtle energy.

280
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,999
And because this is the seat of your Spirit,

281
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,080
but the seat in human beings resides in their heart,

282
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,799
immediately the Spirit,

283
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:18,000
start emitting light

284
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,280
on your central nervous system.

285
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,960
This is a very important point one must know.

286
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,000
So you cannot understand it through your mental activity,

287
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,960
but through your evolutionary process,

288
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,480
you manifest a new awareness on your central nervous system.

289
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,120
And this awareness is called - in the Christian

290
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,960
tradition in the olden times

291
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,799
they were called as gnostics.

292
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:49,799
"Gna, gna" is the word. "Gna".

293
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:53,400
Gna jinant is, in Sanskrit means "knowledge,"

294
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,200
from where the "gna" comes - "gnyana".

295
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,040
In the same way the "gna", and "gnostics" they were called.

296
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,760
And I'm sure you must have read the Book of Thomas

297
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:06,960
who wrote on his way to India,

298
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,520
and where he has talked of many theories of Christianity also.

299
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:16,799
This "gna" or this knowledge, "gnya",

300
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:19,999
is the same as "bodha" in the Buddha tradition,

301
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,760
is "to know on your central nervous system".

302
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,799
It's an experience, it's not through your brain,

303
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:27,799
not with mental activity,

304
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:30,999
but on your central nervous system.

305
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,799
In the Vedas the first verse of Veda is

306
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:37,960
that you have to know it in a vida.

307
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,800
"Vida" means also "to know on your central nervous system".

308
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,240
All these scriptures aim at

309
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,000
knowing this all-pervading Power

310
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,799
on your central nervous system.

311
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,999
For example, now we are human beings,

312
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,320
We are much better off than animals.

313
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,520
Supposing you want to take a dog through a dirty lane,

314
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,600
he can easily go, or a horse, he has no problems.

315
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,000
But we cannot pass through that,

316
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,120
because we have developed certain subtler senses within us.

317
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,999
But once Kundalini rises and you become a realized soul,

318
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,999
then a new dimension of awareness

319
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,600
develops, and a widening of your awareness.

320
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,640
First thing that happens on your central nervous system is that,

321
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,799
that you become collectively conscious.

322
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:38,999
Is said by Jung - Jung has it said about it

323
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,160
that you develop collective consciousness.

324
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,760
You develop it, it's actualization, it's becoming.

325
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:48,760
Is not just that I say that,

326
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:51,280
"All right, we are all brothers and sisters.

327
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,240
We are part and parcel of the whole."

328
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,720
By saying that doesn't happen, but you have to become.

329
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:59,720
It's a becoming, it's a happening within us.

330
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:03,040
So you can feel on your fingertips

331
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,720
your own centers

332
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,960
and the centers of another person.

333
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Very easily. Even children can feel it.

334
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,000
This is the first awareness which we can understand

335
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,360
that happens.

336
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,600
But when the Kundalini rises, She passes through a portion

337
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,240
which we call as Void. It's not the same as Zen, is different type;

338
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,999
is here in the portion which we can

339
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,240
call as the "ocean of illusion."

340
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:40,999
It enlightens ten valencies within us.

341
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,080
Human beings have ten valencies,

342
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,799
while you know that matter has eight, animals have nine,

343
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:50,160
and human beings have ten valencies.

344
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,960
These are ten dharmas,

345
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,840
means these are ten religions you can call it,

346
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,520
or the Ten Commandments within us.

347
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,999
They just get enlightened within you,

348
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,440
and you become a righteous person.

349
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,960
Like any saint. You become righteous.

350
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,799
Nobody has to tell you "don't do this, don't do that".

351
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:11,999
You just become.

352
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,999
This is what has to happen, because

353
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,480
you see people belonging to any religion whatsoever,

354
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,040
whether it is Christianity, Hinduism,

355
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,520
or Islam or anyone,

356
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,999
they can commit any sin they want to.

357
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,999
There's no bondage of religion in them.

358
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,200
Anyone can commit any sin. They can kill anybody,

359
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,799
they can rob anybody, they can deceive anybody,

360
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:43,680
they can be very mean, anything is possible,

361
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,360
whatever religion one may follow.

362
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,999
But when you are not innately religious as I call it,

363
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,999
when it is not built in within you,

364
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,720
then this kind of faith leads to fanaticism.

365
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,640
And I think today's main problem now

366
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,880
is fanaticism and fundamentalism.

367
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,880
Everyone thinks that "We are the best, we are the chosen ones,

368
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,080
we have the full idea".

369
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,000
But actually unless and until you know the reality,

370
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,240
you cannot say that you have known it.

371
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,040
So to know the reality

372
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,799
the Kundalini has first to be connected with the Divine,

373
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:28,960
and then you have to experiment with it

374
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,080
and see for yourself, and find out

375
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,960
what is the reality, on experience.

376
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,999
The other day one miracle happened, I must tell you that.

377
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,560
A gentleman was sitting

378
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,720
and was questioning Me on a radio station,

379
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:54,999
and suddenly he asked Me a question,

380
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,999
"Do You think this is some sort of a Messiah's work?"

381
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,999
I didn't answer him,

382
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,480
but immediately he felt cool breeze on his hand.

383
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,880
He said, "What's happening?" He forgot he was on the tape, you see.

384
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,799
He just said, "What's it? What is this cold, what's happening?

385
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:15,240
But nothing on my head". He just got lost.

386
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,799
He said, "Nothing on my head."

387
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:19,760
I said, "All right, there's a little imbalance. Let Me work it out."

388
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:21,920
And then he started feeling, "Oh God!" and he said,

389
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,799
"See, I feel a ball, a ball of cool breeze in New Zealand!"

390
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:29,799
And everybody rushed from the, that area

391
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:32,799
to see what is happening, what everybody has received.

392
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:35,440
Just he asked a simple question like that,

393
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,400
and the answer came, like a computer you see it worked.

394
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,280
And he was amazed at himself.

395
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,999
So this is something one has to realize,

396
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,160
that this is the power that really does everything.

397
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,799
What we do is to something dead.

398
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:53,080
Supposing there's some trees dead, we make this table,

399
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,320
we think no end of ourselves - from dead to dead.

400
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,360
Just reconstruction, we don't do any living work.

401
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,960
But after Realization you start doing

402
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,960
living work.

403
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,240
If you give this chaitanya or these vibrations

404
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,520
to crops, they grow ten times more.

405
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,200
You don't have to even use

406
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,880
the non, we use non, what do you call them,

407
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,720
- hybrid seeds, non-hybrid seeds.

408
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:29,680
And hybrid seeds

409
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,800
are producing less than the non-hybrid seeds

410
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,840
when you have given them vibrations.

411
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,640
And the food that you eat from that

412
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,480
is so good, so tasty.

413
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,999
It, you can give it to flowers, you can give it to nature,

414
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,480
you can give it to any sick person.

415
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,200
When the Kundalini rises,

416
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,799
automatically you develop your own balances,

417
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:58,799
and that balanced life manifests outside.

418
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:00,799
Now this ecological problem can be solved

419
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:04,160
as soon as human beings get transformed and develop their balances.

420
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,880
Because we are imbalanced,

421
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,240
that's why the nature has gone into imbalance.

422
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,880
Nature is not in any imbalance.

423
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,480
Poor thing is trying to maintain somehow balance,

424
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,800
despite all our hectic efforts.

425
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,560
So our balance has to be established

426
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,960
so that balance comes into us,

427
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,999
and we start leading a life of complete balance, automatically.

428
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,520
Automatically. Nobody has to tell you but you just don't do it,

429
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,999
just become that.

430
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,800
Then another thing you can do living work,

431
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,920
is that you can raise the Kundalini of any person,

432
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,999
like one enlightened light can enlighten another person.

433
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,999
There has been lots of misconceptions about Kundalini

434
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,600
and I've read them, and I was amazed

435
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,760
because these are most unauthorized.

436
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:57,760
These are all modern stuff that has come from somewhere;

437
00:29:57,999 --> 00:30:01,720
I think it's all a money-making propositions, perhaps,

438
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:04,200
because nowhere in the ancient books is written

439
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,999
that Kundalini has any problems or it gives any trouble.

440
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,440
One great saint called Ramadasa,

441
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,520
who was the guru of a great king called Shivaji,

442
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,600
he was asked, "How much time does it take for a Kundalini to rise?"

443
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,999
So He used the Sanskrit word tatkshana - that moment -

444
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,000
but there should be a person who is authorized

445
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,040
to do it from the Divine, and there should be a seeker of truth,

446
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,000
otherwise it won't work out, for years.

447
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,080
So nowhere in the ancient books

448
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,520
- we have Markandeya's, which we can say

449
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,999
thousands of years back has written about Kundalini;

450
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,999
we have Adi Shankacharya, all of them

451
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,760
- nobody has written anything like that.

452
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:48,360
In the twelfth century Gyaneshwara has written about Kundalini.

453
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,320
Nobody has said this is dangerous.

454
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,999
This is a modern stuff, I think coming from Germany,

455
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,880
because Germans came here and somebody told them something,

456
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,760
and they have written down. It's most unauthorized and wrong.

457
00:30:59,999 --> 00:31:04,800
Now there are forty nations which are working out Sahaja Yoga,

458
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,560
forty nations.

459
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,480
And nowhere we have found this kind of a thing that it's dangerous,

460
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,999
this thing happens, that thing happens - nothing of the kind.

461
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,080
On the contrary,

462
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,720
people get physical fitness, mental fitness.

463
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,640
We have got three doctors from Delhi University

464
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,799
who have done their MD

465
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:27,080
with Sahaja Yoga,

466
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,999
and have proved that with Sahaja Yoga you can cure

467
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,960
very incurable diseases.

468
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,320
I must tell you a very great news, that in Perth

469
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,640
husband and wife who had AIDS got cured

470
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,520
in this tour of Mine,

471
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,880
just by their own powers.

472
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,799
You don't have to do anything about it - their own powers,

473
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:49,360
just worked out. I hope they keep up.

474
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,280
We had cured one other gentleman here, Mr. Granby,

475
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,720
last time when I came here,

476
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,999
but he had no will power to continue with it.

477
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,560
If he had a little bit put attention to it,

478
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,480
he would have been all right. And his father is very sorry

479
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,999
that he went back to the same bad habits, and he got it back.

480
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,000
So many things can be explained about

481
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,760
things which we do not know, about the soul,

482
00:32:16,999 --> 00:32:20,240
about possessions,

483
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,680
about evil forces -

484
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,680
all sorts of things one can see,

485
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:26,880
once you get your Self-Realization.

486
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,040
Before that we are in a confused state,

487
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,120
and that's why they say that

488
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,640
when the Spirit shines,

489
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,720
there are three things which manifest within us.

490
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,440
One of them is the truth,

491
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,640
that you know the absolute truth.

492
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,200
On your fingertips you can ask any question, "Is there God?"

493
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,960
- the question. Answer is "yes" - you start feeling the cool breeze.

494
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,999
Somebody who says he's a saint, all right, just feel him.

495
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,120
You might get heat,

496
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,080
you might even sometimes get a little blister

497
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,720
from some horrible person who is just a money-maker

498
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,920
or a sorcerer trying to say that he's a saint.

499
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,360
So that's how you develop the absolute truth

500
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,200
on your central nervous system.

501
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,280
As I can feel this glass, you can feel

502
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,240
a person, his centers.

503
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,640
Sitting down here you can - I mean, it's at an evolved state -

504
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,760
you can feel anybody's centers.

505
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:33,880
Just you have to think about it. It's like a computer.

506
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,920
You are all divine computers, fantastic things,

507
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,520
which thinks and which produces results,

508
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,840
which you have to be.

509
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,320
We should not in any way

510
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,200
have our estimation very low.

511
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,280
Actually we are made human beings

512
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,560
to be something very great, and we are that.

513
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,999
But there's a little gap which we have to cross.

514
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,040
Like in our Indian village if I take a television and show them,

515
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,200
and say that, "See, in this television you can see

516
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,640
pictures from all over," they'll say, "What? This is just a box.

517
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,240
How can we see something in it?"

518
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,480
And you put to the mains, and then they can see how fantastic it is.

519
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,120
In the same way we have to know our potential

520
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,560
by being connected to the mains,

521
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,400
and then you'll be amazed that we are great,

522
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,799
all of us.

523
00:34:30,999 --> 00:34:32,800
Specially the seekers of truth,

524
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,799
have the first right to get their yoga.

525
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:38,680
But if you are still indulging with your mental things

526
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,880
and you want to have a mental acrobats,

527
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,799
still busy with all that, then

528
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,080
Divine says, "All right, go ahead, play,

529
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,240
try some more of this.

530
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,280
We'll see next time."

531
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,720
But you don't have to have blind faith for anything.

532
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,999
Blind faith leads to fanaticism.

533
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,999
You shouldn't have blind faith at all.

534
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,480
You have to experience,

535
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,799
and after experiencing

536
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:08,040
if you do not have faith, that means you are not honest.

537
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,560
This is a very simple method which works out,

538
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,320
and you are all capable of getting that,

539
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,360
and you should not miss the point.

540
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,999
I don't know, because I have spoken on this subject

541
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,240
so many times and it's such a vast knowledge,

542
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,400
there must have been at least three to four thousand tapes of Mine

543
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,280
in English language alone.

544
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,080
So in this small lecture I cannot cover all the points.

545
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,799
But I would like to have a discussion, or

546
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:40,680
if you want to ask Me questions

547
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,760
will be better to give more time to it.

548
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,520
But you have to know that I am not here to sort of

549
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,960
ask for any votes, or ask for anything.

550
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,160
I'm here to tell you what you have and what you can achieve,

551
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,999
so the questions should be relevant and not aggressive;

552
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,880
it would be a better idea to know something about it.

553
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
So may God bless you all.

554
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,760
Steven, you'll have to...

555
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:20,960
you see, I'm rather bad at Australian English.

556
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,560
- I'll mediate for You. 
- Yes, you please tell Me.

557
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,800
- Feel free to ask any questions.

558
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,880
And those who are uncomfortable standing,

559
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,280
you may want to sit down somewhere -

560
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,999
on the floor.

561
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,800
Yes.

562
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,680
Is there anybody wanting to,

563
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,960
to ask something? ...

564
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,600
Rachel - this will be Canadian English so...

565
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,999
I speak Canadian English so that maybe it's clearer.

566
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,160
Q: You pointed to the problem of mental acrobatics,

567
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,680
intellectual indulgence and so forth.

568
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:16,880
At what point can someone who has crossed over the gap

569
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,999
and who has achieved perhaps a pure desire,

570
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:26,440
at what point can that person articulate intellectually

571
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:29,799
what he or she has achieved;

572
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:32,999
or can You articulate?

573
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:38,200
- You see, when you are mentally working it out,

574
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:42,560
then you reach a point where you think

575
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,680
you have not achieved whatever is said in it

576
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,999
- that's the point.

577
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,080
As we say that first

578
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,400
one has to know it mentally also.

579
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,120
"Not this, not this, not this," you go on

580
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,720
- "Ya neti neti vachanaih" it is said.

581
00:38:01,999 --> 00:38:03,840
So "It is not this, this is not so.

582
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,280
This cannot be, this cannot be."

583
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,200
Then you reach a point, then you become a seeker.

584
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:16,440
And a new kind of a category is created,

585
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,680
which William Blake has very nicely categorized,

586
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,480
and he says, then he called them men of God.

587
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:26,799
"Men of God will become men of God,

588
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:30,960
and they'll have powers to make others men of God."

589
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,799
He was really a great, great poet hundred years back,

590
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:38,999
but people thought him to be mad, I tell you;

591
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,920
they thought him to be mad,

592
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,799
because it has happened with all the saints

593
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:47,160
because they are on a different level, you see.

594
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,640
Even Kabira has said, "How am I to explain,

595
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,880
they are all, the whole world is blind, [samaja ganda].

596
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,960
The whole world is blind. How am I to explain to them?"

597
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,400
They feel so frustrated sometimes.

598
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,560
How to explain?

599
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,440
So on mental level it, as I have talked to you,

600
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,880
I have explained to you in a way.

601
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,040
But still it has to be your experience,

602
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,280
you shouldn't believe in Me blindly, it's not proper.

603
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,880
You have to experience.

604
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,280
- Some people have said that the moment you describe

605
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,799
and articulate your enlightenment you are actually not enlightened,

606
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:28,799
and that it actually is

607
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,880
contrary to enlightenment to talk about it.

608
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,000
How do You feel about those things?

609
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,800
You see, these are all money-making propositions.

610
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:42,799
Most of them don't know anything about it.

611
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:46,080
So they just say, because you see if you start an organization,

612
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,799
"Oh, I have such an organization, this and that."

613
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:50,999
Then people say, "All right, then raise our Kundalini."

614
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,400
"No, no, no, no, no, Kundalini you just don't talk,

615
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,280
it's a very bad thing."

616
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,760
In Gyaneshwari, which is one of the greatest books, I think,

617
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:01,720
written about Gita by Gyaneshwara,

618
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,480
at the age of twenty-three years

619
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,999
- imagine what a tremendous genius he must have been

620
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,960
- and in the sixth chapter He described everything about Kundalini.

621
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,600
But in the Hindu religion it's prohibited, especially in Maharashtra,

622
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,999
to read even that.

623
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,560
What do you say to that?

624
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,799
[Ishita] as they call it, no, not to be read, it's not to be read

625
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:30,800
- I think what Rachel is getting at

626
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,200
though applies more to Buddhism,

627
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,800
that if for example in our head

628
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,799
say it, "Look, I've attained to Nirvana,

629
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:46,480
I've been enlightened,"

630
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,360
then even within the community of bikus or the whole sanga

631
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,720
they would laugh and say, "Oh, you can't be,

632
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,200
because you're articulating it, you're saying,

633
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,999
you know, 'I'm enlightened,'

634
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,760
it doesn't go with enlightenment."

635
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:06,799
So there is a difference between that position

636
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:09,880
and the way You're talking about Realization.

637
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,840
- Not at all. You see, early, early Buddhists

638
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,680
- My son-in-law has written a nice book about

639
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,320
Manasarovar and this thing, and he went round

640
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,200
and he has studied Buddhism,

641
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,799
and he has gone to the caves where the earlier Buddhists lived.

642
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:26,360
And they just talked of spontaneous awakening

643
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,440
and the experiences like the Thomas has talked.

644
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,999
But this is a much later thing

645
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,960
when the quarrel started with Mahayana, this, that.

646
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,799
They formulated it, organized it, and this, and all that.

647
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:41,799
But actually if you see to it,

648
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,120
Buddha Himself

649
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,999
is one of the part of the Kundalini.

650
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,999
You have to use His name;

651
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,920
He is the one who controls our ego, in evolution.

652
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,999
Now when they say, "Buddham sharanam gacchami",

653
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,000
means "I surrender myself to the enlightened one"

654
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,799
"Buddham sharanam gacchami."

655
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:16,280
Then they say, "Dharmam sharanam gacchami."

656
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,720
"Dharmam" is that valency business I'm talking about,

657
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,999
that "I surrender myself to my valencies, my dharma" - dharma.

658
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,240
And the third one He said is, "Sangam sharanam gacchami."

659
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,920
That means, "I surrender myself to collectivity".

660
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,840
Is Sahaja Yoga only,

661
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,280
but you should be able to see between the lines.

662
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,960
Same about Gita.

663
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,640
If you read Gita superficially,

664
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,760
you will think that He has said about karma yoga

665
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:50,800
and He has said about gyana yoga.

666
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,320
Now what gyana yoga is, what I'm talking about,

667
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,960
that you have to know it on your central nervous system.

668
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,720
But Krishna didn't talk much about it.

669
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:05,520
So then Arjuna asked, "What about the karma?"

670
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,400
So Krishna was a incarnation of diplomacy, I must say,

671
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,120
divine diplomacy,

672
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,680
because He knew about the human brain,

673
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,360
and He knew how to put it forward.

674
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,400
So He said, "All right, you do all your karmas,

675
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,280
and put it at the Lotus Feet of the Lord",

676
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,480
which cannot be, it's not possible.

677
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,080
We may mentally think, "Oh, I'm doing all for God's sake.

678
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,640
I'm doing this." That's just our imagination.

679
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,720
But you just don't do it, because the karma has to become akarma,

680
00:43:37,999 --> 00:43:39,960
means "non-action".

681
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,280
That's only possible when you get your Self-Realization.

682
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,640
When a Self-realized soul gives you Kundalini, he doesn't say,

683
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,799
raises your Kundalini, doesn't say, "I do it".

684
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:52,280
He says, "It's rising, it's going, it's working out."

685
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,280
In the third person he talks,

686
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,240
so the whole thing becomes akarma.

687
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,840
Then He says that pushpam palam toyam

688
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,799
"Whatever are the flowers and things like that

689
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:06,720
you give Me" - that's the bhakti yoga - "I'll take it."

690
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:10,840
But He uses only one word on which He has made everybody dance,

691
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,280
and that word is "ananya" - ananya bhakti,

692
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,000
"When there is not the other, when you are united with Me."

693
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,640
But people say, "We are doing ananya bhakti,"

694
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,999
and then you find such horrible things.

695
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,999
These people who are devoted and doing all these things,

696
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,880
taking ganja, taking this, how can they do it?

697
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,280
People can't understand, so it is not ananya.

698
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,760
Ananya is only possible when you get your Self-Realization;

699
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,640
otherwise it's not possible.

700
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,280
- So You are saying that actually

701
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,920
ones who wrote about their [particular] experiences

702
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,960
are true mystics. Then You know it's not [unclear]

703
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,280
but some people would discount the mystics.

704
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,720
There would be true mystics people have then written about

705
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,320
what they have tried to explain, their experience,

706
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,799
like [unclear] John of the Cross.

707
00:45:05,999 --> 00:45:08,999
- I couldn't hear. Can you explain to Me?

708
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,200
- She's asking - this is Jacqueline -

709
00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:17,840
that You are saying then

710
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,680
that mystics

711
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,760
who have written about their own mystical experiences,

712
00:45:23,999 --> 00:45:25,799
are truly mystics.

713
00:45:25,999 --> 00:45:28,400
But just because they've talked about them

714
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,799
and written about them, you know, doesn't mean that...

715
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:33,680
But there are many mystics who are real

716
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,040
and there are many mystics who are not.

717
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,280
Anybody can call themselves as mystics.

718
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,120
I've seen there are Sufis,

719
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,799
who are real Sufis, and there are many who are not.

720
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:46,320
There are many who are saints, real saints, and there are not.

721
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,560
How will you make them out?

722
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,800
With vibrations you can make them out,

723
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,800
that's the only way.

724
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
So their experiences, whatever it is,

725
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,999
are not to be taken for granted.

726
00:46:03,999 --> 00:46:05,799
- But I was saying that a mystic

727
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:08,720
who returns to the market place so to speak,

728
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,999
and relates their experience to all

729
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,280
like John of the Cross [did in poems], he didn't want to relate it

730
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,799
but he was compelled by the requests of people

731
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:21,040
around him in his community ...

732
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,799
[unclear] anyway to relate his experience,

733
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:29,520
- and that's sort of something shared in the collective.

734
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,720
So that if someone who has the experience, like a shaman,

735
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,480
and then can bring it back for healing to others, to the collective.

736
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,640
- You cannot share it like that.

737
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,320
At human level you cannot share it.

738
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,280
You have to be at the higher level, you cannot share it.

739
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,680
It's like something you have to see in histology,

740
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,799
you have to use a microscope.

741
00:46:51,999 --> 00:46:54,280
In the same way you have to be a subtler being

742
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,999
to share the experience of a mystic, you cannot share it.

743
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,520
Like see, Khalil Gibran, Khalil Gibran.

744
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,200
What will you say, was he a realized soul or not?

745
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,920
Some will say yes, some will say no.

746
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,720
I'll say yes, of course he was.

747
00:47:16,999 --> 00:47:21,000
- But I consider it a sharing if someone can say to someone else

748
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,960
- You cannot share unless and until,

749
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,120
unless and until you become a realized soul.

750
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,760
Because there are so many barriers between two persons,

751
00:47:30,999 --> 00:47:32,799
you cannot share with anyone.

752
00:47:32,999 --> 00:47:34,600
It is within yourself.

753
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,799
- I'm not perhaps trying to choose the right words,

754
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:38,880
but I just mean in the sense of

755
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,760
how the people for whom John of the Cross wrote, for example,

756
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:45,040
were needing reassurance

757
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,999
and perhaps guidance in their realization.

758
00:47:50,999 --> 00:47:54,999
- She is using the example of a famous Spanish mystic,

759
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,280
John of the Cross.

760
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,999
It's a very, very interesting person

761
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,240
with deep spiritual experiences,

762
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,799
who then conveyed something of his experiences

763
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:11,680
to ordinary people.

764
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,640
- I mean, You are conveying Your experiences to ordinary people...

765
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,799
- No, I say your experiences.

766
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:20,040
I am just telling. I didn't tell you anything about My experiences.

767
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,320
I am saying that you have to experience yourself, not saying that;

768
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,520
and now I would say, now you are taking the Spanish people -

769
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,440
[Illán], have you read [Illán]?

770
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,960
That's the one who is a realized soul.

771
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,480
He is a realized soul, I mean, you can see it is a realized soul.

772
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,720
I mean, you take his book and you have vibrations in your hands.

773
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,240
- Did You meet John?

774
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,760
- Do realized souls ever feel lured

775
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:53,880
take a leading part in public life?

776
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,799
And if so, does it make society a better place when they do it,

777
00:48:57,999 --> 00:48:59,880
even though the people under them are only

778
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,160
seeking or not realized at all?

779
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,880
- Of course! I mean, this will not only make a beautiful society

780
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,960
of very beautiful people - now,

781
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,799
last year we had eighty-two marriages, international marriages,

782
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:15,999
and all these marriages are successful.

783
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,280
It's very well-balanced, beautiful

784
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,680
- one or two mishaps sometimes, one or two mishaps.

785
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,320
And the children they have, are all realized souls,

786
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,799
because there are realized souls who want to take birth,

787
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:35,799
but they want to seek proper parents, you see,

788
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,999
they don't want to be born to crazy ones, you know;

789
00:49:39,999 --> 00:49:42,720
Naturally, I mean, they have to think about it.

790
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,880
And so many are now today realized souls, otherwise also born,

791
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,720
but parents don't know about them.

792
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,760
Are there any leaders in public life in the world today

793
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:55,799
who are realized people, what You think?

794
00:49:55,999 --> 00:49:58,680
SM: Of course! Gorbachev is.

795
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,400
Abraham Lincoln was,

796
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,999
Sadat was - so many.

797
00:50:05,999 --> 00:50:09,999
Then Mahatma Gandhi was there, he was a realized soul.

798
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,999
Yes, Michelle.

799
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,840
- Now I can express my dissatisfaction

800
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,360
with all these accounts, mystical accounts which I've read.

801
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,799
I've read quite a few,

802
00:50:24,999 --> 00:50:28,400
and they seem not speak to me.

803
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,720
I feel, yes, they've achieved something,

804
00:50:31,999 --> 00:50:35,520
but the way they express it doesn't reach me.

805
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,960
It's like they don't speak the right language for me.

806
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,799
Now surprisingly when I read the philosophy of people

807
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:46,799
who I think are not enlightened or they make mistakes, but somehow

808
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:50,240
I'm already led somewhere much better than these accounts.

809
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,520
So I think it's important that these realized souls

810
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,760
have good abilities to,

811
00:50:56,999 --> 00:50:59,799
have some special language to reach the masses.

812
00:50:59,999 --> 00:51:03,800
I think someone who is a computer programmer who gets enlightened

813
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,480
would have great ability to move other computer programmers.

814
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,720
- This is what Sahaja Yoga is doing, it's bridging you;

815
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,440
this is what Sahaja Yoga does.

816
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,999
Then you understand all of them,

817
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,440
you'll understand all of them.

818
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,680
You'll be surprised,

819
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,520
when I started Sahaja Yoga in London,

820
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,200
when My husband got posted there,

821
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,280
I had to really struggle with seven hippies

822
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,480
for four years, I tell you - terrible!

823
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,240
They were all very well-educated people from Cambridge, this, that,

824
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,880
all very well-educated, had become hippies.

825
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,160
Out of their seeking they had become hippies.

826
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,880
They thought by becoming hippies they'll seek God, whatever it is.

827
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,680
But when they got their Realization,

828
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,440
just they said, "Now we understand all of them".

829
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,240
They went to the libraries, found out this is that, that is that.

830
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,880
I mean, the scholarship of England I saw then,

831
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,040
when they got their Realization. Before that -

832
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,240
Bacon is there, all right, writing this way, that way;

833
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,920
then they found out all the people who were realized souls,

834
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,040
and the best of all was Shakespeare.

835
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,999
Like this, they announced...

836
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,799
It's hard, it's a little hard

837
00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:29,920
for me to hear everything You say...

838
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,999
- I'm sorry. 
- But am I correct

839
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,360
in hearing You speak of children as realized souls?

840
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,999
- Yes. 
- And in that case

841
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,999
is Self-Realization

842
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,920
a gift,

843
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,799
or is it the work of a person

844
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:56,560
over a period of time of maturing?

845
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,640
It is a - you see, those I'm saying are realized souls

846
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,720
have received their Realization in previous lives.

847
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,960
And now, it's not a gift, it's just a evolutionary process.

848
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,999
Just works out. It's a living process of a living energy.

849
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,840
- Now, you explain...

850
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,799
- Just wondering if You think there's a difference

851
00:53:24,999 --> 00:53:27,799
between the Eastern and Western psyche;

852
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:30,960
and if You do, what do You think the differences are?

853
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,999
- Yes.

854
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,999
Now the Western movement has been outward,

855
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,200
like a tree,

856
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,440
the whole civilization grew up.

857
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,680
But it must seek its roots.

858
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,520
To My eye there's not two things, East and West -

859
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,920
the roots are the same as the tree;

860
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,720
and if the tree does not find out its roots, it will be destroyed.

861
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,680
Both are essential,

862
00:54:02,999 --> 00:54:05,360
complementary to each other.

863
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,999
But because, as I told you, the climate in India

864
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,520
has been quite kind,

865
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,680
they went more into the search of themselves - "why are we here?"

866
00:54:17,999 --> 00:54:19,280
- instead of fighting the nature.

867
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:23,999
But if you see the - I mean in London if you have to go out,

868
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,480
you take at least fifteen minutes just to put on all your weapons

869
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,120
to fight the climate there.

870
00:54:33,999 --> 00:54:37,680
In our country you can just walk out, no problem.

871
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,080
So we didn't have to fight the nature,

872
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,480
so that question was over;

873
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,999
and it was a very beautiful country,

874
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,999
full of fruits and things,

875
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,480
so they could live in the jungles very well.

876
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,720
Even now if you go,

877
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:58,560
at the foothill of Himalayas you'll find all kinds of flowers,

878
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,200
beautiful things there are.

879
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,360
Of course now it's destroyed, because of civilization.

880
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,360
So the people indulged more in finding out

881
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,640
what is within us,

882
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:12,240
and that's how they did it.

883
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,999
So the search which is outside through science

884
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,480
has to be substantiated and nourished by spirituality -

885
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,920
it's very important.

886
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,560
So these are part and parcel of the same.

887
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,280
God has made only one world, one world.

888
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,999
He didn't make many nations, we have done it.

889
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,799
And sometimes I feel we were moved like criminals

890
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,799
with our number-plate, you see,

891
00:55:37,999 --> 00:55:40,720
the passport number, this number, that number.

892
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,999
God didn't make that way, it's our idea;

893
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,799
because we laugh the same way,

894
00:55:49,999 --> 00:55:51,799
we smile the same way,

895
00:55:51,999 --> 00:55:54,920
we love the same way, everything is the same.

896
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,120
But He had to create variety of faces,

897
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,560
otherwise we would have been bored stiff!

898
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,799
You'll be surprised, we have those forty nations I said,

899
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:13,640
specially Russians.

900
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,640
I must say a word for Russians specially, you see.

901
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,999
Whatever may have been the mistakes of their

902
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,840
dominating

903
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,999
administrations and things, whatever they had,

904
00:56:29,999 --> 00:56:32,000
there's one thing good:

905
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,360
as they didn't deal with politics and other things, you see,

906
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,640
they put their minds to search within.

907
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,640
They're very well-read people, very well-educated,

908
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:45,680
very deep scientists also,

909
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,080
but all of them have one mind in the science

910
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,880
and another mind towards the Spirit.

911
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,799
And I was amazed when I went there to Leningrad

912
00:56:53,999 --> 00:56:55,640
and they had never heard about Me,

913
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,440
because there are no books available on Sahaja Yoga,

914
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,560
or I've never written any books so far.

915
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,240
There were two thousand people sitting outside

916
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,999
and two thousand inside, in the hall.

917
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,240
And after the lecture I gave Realization there

918
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,800
- of course, this Realization works out en masse -

919
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,999
and when they came out, they all asked Me, "Mother, what about us?"

920
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,600
I said, "I'm sorry, the hall is small.

921
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,320
If you can come tomorrow in this ground, I'll be here."

922
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,080
Next morning I went there, the two thousand outside ones

923
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,400
and inside ones all were there to meet Me.

924
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,480
And now it has become sort of an,

925
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,000
you can say, a kind of a big wave of Sahaja Yoga.

926
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:44,880
They sent their people for filming in India,

927
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:49,280
and they have accepted us as an independent organization

928
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,640
for medical treatment, for education.

929
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,520
They are going to give us a big house,

930
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,800
everything, I mean whatever we want - the government.

931
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:06,520
So sort of they were just waiting for it,

932
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,520
just waiting for it.

933
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,999
- Tell. 
- In week of...

934
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,799
I'm getting [many signs of] people who would like to ask questions.

935
00:58:17,999 --> 00:58:21,160
That, that's fine, but is there anybody else

936
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,520
liking to ask a question?

937
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,799
I didn't explain earlier that Mother is a medical doctor,

938
00:58:27,999 --> 00:58:30,840
so there may be questions, say, connecting,

939
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,799
you know, healing with what She's talking about.

940
00:58:34,999 --> 00:58:36,799
And since She's talked about politics,

941
00:58:36,999 --> 00:58:39,799
I forgot to mention that She is the wife of,

942
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:42,480
I think, the senior-most public servant in the United Nations.

943
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,920
He's Secretary General,

944
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,760
he's the senior-most Secretary-General of the UN.

945
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:52,960
- Of the United Nations. So if you like to ask about politics even,

946
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,640
She's very well-informed.

947
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,960
-What's his name?

948
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,560
- And on top of that I forgot to welcome

949
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,320
- Ah, it's rather difficult then... 
- those who've come from within the

950
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,760
Sahaja Yoga community; that I welcome you all,

951
00:59:09,999 --> 00:59:11,720
those who come from that community,

952
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,840
who may have particular questions

953
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,960
that they'd like to ask You in this context,

954
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,799
and by all means feel free about that,

955
00:59:18,999 --> 00:59:22,640
before we get back to those who want to ask You second questions -

956
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,640
Anybody here? John.

957
00:59:27,999 --> 00:59:31,240
We've all had experiences. Generally I find

958
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,799
- and I've explored experience to some extent -

959
00:59:33,999 --> 00:59:37,760
my experiences seem to be limited by

960
00:59:37,999 --> 00:59:40,040
my senses, my physical presence here.

961
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,799
And if there is this all-pervading Power,

962
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,999
that is something which is transcendent to my senses,

963
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,880
it seems to me paradoxical. How can I experience this,

964
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:55,999
when all my experience is bound by my senses?

965
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,240
I mean, is there a real experience of that?

966
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,360
You see, I still don't know that.

967
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,920
Experience of what?

968
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,880
Well, You said that a person can have experience of this power,

969
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,680
this transcendental power, when this is something I suppose I know.

970
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,760
Yes, of course, of course it is there.

971
01:00:11,999 --> 01:00:14,000
And not only that, but you go beyond your mind,

972
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,480
because you reach a state which is called as thoughtless awareness,

973
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,480
thoughtless awareness. You are aware,

974
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:22,400
but there's no thought.

975
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,799
For example, a thought rises within us and then it falls,

976
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:28,120
and another thought rises and falls.

977
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,999
We live either in the past or in the future;

978
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,920
on the cusp of these thoughts we are dancing all the time.

979
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:40,120
So when the Kundalini rises these thoughts become lean,

980
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,800
and there's a space in between which is the present,

981
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
which in Sanskrit is called as "vilamba".

982
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,840
So when the Kundalini rises

983
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,760
you become thoughtless.

984
01:00:51,999 --> 01:00:53,360
If you want to think you can think it,

985
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,799
but if you don't want to think you are in thoughtless awareness.

986
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:57,840
That's the samadhi state, that's the state

987
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,799
of what you call is the meditative state,

988
01:01:00,999 --> 01:01:04,600
where first is called as "thoughtless awareness".

989
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,640
In Sanskrit it's called as "nirvichara samadhi".

990
01:01:07,999 --> 01:01:10,000
Then the second state that is achieved

991
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:15,080
is called as "doubtless awareness," called as "Nirvikalpa" - means

992
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,560
you are so evolved that

993
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,040
you have no doubts about it, you just work it out.

994
01:01:22,999 --> 01:01:24,640
And in a sense that it's beyond,

995
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,080
even that it's an experience, it's also beyond experience.

996
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,799
It's like an experience beyond experience,

997
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:31,880
because that is an experience of something

998
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,880
on which all other experiences are based.

999
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,799
- Yes, it is beyond that, of course.

1000
01:01:35,999 --> 01:01:38,799
So in a sense it's like an end of experience, at the same time.

1001
01:01:38,999 --> 01:01:42,799
No, no, no, no! The experience is of the feeling

1002
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:46,799
this all-pervading Power, is precise - all right?

1003
01:01:46,999 --> 01:01:49,240
And then the experience

1004
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:53,999
of feeling your centers on your fingertips, to be precise.

1005
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,999
Then the experience is

1006
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,680
that you can become thoughtlessly aware.

1007
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,880
Then the experience is that if you want to work on other people,

1008
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:08,560
you find that you can find out about their own centers,

1009
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,840
and you can raise their Kundalini

1010
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,320
and you can give them Realization.

1011
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,799
So you start experiencing yourself,

1012
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:19,920
like you enter into a big palace - that's yourself.

1013
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,480
So first you enter into the hall,

1014
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,720
then you see other things and then other things,

1015
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,080
and you're amazed at yourself.

1016
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:32,360
It's like that. It's a new dimensions into which you enter.

1017
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,799
-Yes, state...

1018
01:02:36,999 --> 01:02:40,320
Yes, this is actually more a political question, but

1019
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,799
one of the things that fascinates me

1020
01:02:41,999 --> 01:02:43,160
about world politics at the moment

1021
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,120
actually seems to be the Hindu fundamentalism.

1022
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,760
Possibly You give us ....

1023
01:02:47,999 --> 01:02:50,360
- What's it? 
- [unclear] Hindu fundamentalism.

1024
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,799
Would You like to comment on Hindu fundamentalism?

1025
01:02:53,999 --> 01:02:57,640
They are just like anybody else, what's there to comment?

1026
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,920
But it was very late they started.

1027
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:06,520
The reason was also because of the Sikh aggression.

1028
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,240
The Sikhs started killing people in Punjab,

1029
01:03:10,999 --> 01:03:13,999
saying that

1030
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,400
"you are Hindus".

1031
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,840
So they formed themselves into a group,

1032
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,600
"All right, we are Hindus, so what?"

1033
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:25,280
to protect themselves, more sort of protective way they started it.

1034
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,960
But whatever it is I don't agree with that much,

1035
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,799
that why don't they get Realization?

1036
01:03:31,999 --> 01:03:34,999
- nobody can touch you.

1037
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,920
But they'll come round, I think, all of them one day.

1038
01:03:41,999 --> 01:03:43,560
- Alex.

1039
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:48,800
When the realized people write up the accounts of their experience,

1040
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,160
can you discern in those - and You might like to comment -

1041
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,520
whether there are any common elements

1042
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,320
in what I might call in the Western thinking,

1043
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:00,560
triggers for the surrendered life.

1044
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:05,200
In other words, experiences that they might have had which led them

1045
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,680
into the experience of enlightenment.

1046
01:04:08,999 --> 01:04:10,320
I'm interested in this question

1047
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,799
from the point of view of the alcoholic, actually,

1048
01:04:12,999 --> 01:04:16,799
how it is that an alcoholic does undergo a cognitive change,

1049
01:04:16,999 --> 01:04:21,080
a very pronounced cognitive change when he's being rehabilitated,

1050
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,799
particularly in a program like the AA.

1051
01:04:23,999 --> 01:04:27,560
In the enlightened regime,

1052
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,120
are there triggers or indications

1053
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,799
that enlightenment might be just around the corner,

1054
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:37,720
or something which led you into it? Does that make sense?

1055
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,360
- Triggering what?

1056
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,799
Triggers, now trigger is are what you pull when you shoot guns!

1057
01:04:42,999 --> 01:04:46,600
I know, I know that part.

1058
01:04:47,999 --> 01:04:51,280
But one other way of referring to these triggers

1059
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,520
is what we call predisposing factors

1060
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,240
for enlightenment.

1061
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,440
Are people

1062
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:03,480
because of the evolutionary process

1063
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,840
in a position where there are more predisposing factors

1064
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,280
for them to become enlightened,

1065
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,520
or are there certain things which could happen in their lives?

1066
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,800
Like You use the example of the Kali Yuga, it's so oppressive,

1067
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,600
so you know, suddenly you realize

1068
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,640
something desperately has to be done.

1069
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,799
But I must tell you that the Divine is so anxious

1070
01:05:24,999 --> 01:05:28,920
to give you realization, it doesn't bother about anything.

1071
01:05:29,999 --> 01:05:33,520
And we can compare our evolutionary process

1072
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,999
to a spacecraft.

1073
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,840
In a spacecraft like Sputnik or anything

1074
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,920
there's a container, first container,

1075
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:43,600
and it has containers in it.

1076
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,999
So the first container, containing all other containers, flies.

1077
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,880
But when it goes up to a point

1078
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,480
it has a certain velocity, and then as you say, triggers

1079
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,760
- means there's an explosion,

1080
01:05:57,999 --> 01:06:00,880
and the second container is thrown

1081
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,040
with a much greater velocity.

1082
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,799
Like that it happens. Now we are

1083
01:06:05,999 --> 01:06:07,999
as the last container, we should think,

1084
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,240
and the triggering is so fast, I am Myself amazed

1085
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,600
at the working out of this.

1086
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,640
It is not bothered

1087
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,440
as to what you have done, anything you have sinned, so-called

1088
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,999
- your guilt is all nonsense now,

1089
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,799
everything is absolutely a nonsense.

1090
01:06:23,999 --> 01:06:25,200
It just works out.

1091
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,799
You don't have to do any cleansing, nothing of the kind,

1092
01:06:27,999 --> 01:06:29,640
it just works out.

1093
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:34,000
It's like a torrential, we can say rain of the grace.

1094
01:06:35,999 --> 01:06:37,999
It is happening.

1095
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,720
But there are no common indications? It's just like going back...

1096
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,720
No, no, no, nothing;

1097
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,999
nothing of the kind, nothing.

1098
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,999
- As a practicing Sahaja yogi,

1099
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,600
I've experienced the benefits of thoughtless awareness

1100
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,799
and the benefits of Sahaja Yoga.

1101
01:07:03,999 --> 01:07:07,280
What or how different would my life be

1102
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,760
or my experiences be,

1103
01:07:09,999 --> 01:07:11,799
when I've attained doubtless awareness?

1104
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,799
Is that the aim also of the Sahaja yogi,

1105
01:07:14,999 --> 01:07:17,799
to strive towards doubtless awareness?

1106
01:07:17,999 --> 01:07:19,799
And then how different

1107
01:07:19,999 --> 01:07:21,799
or what changes would I experience

1108
01:07:21,999 --> 01:07:25,999
in doubtless awareness, when I am a practicing Sahaja yogini?

1109
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:30,440
In doubtless awareness when you rise from thoughtless awareness,

1110
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,520
what happens that you start growing,

1111
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,799
because only in present you grow.

1112
01:07:34,999 --> 01:07:37,999
You start growing, and then

1113
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,080
you feel like doing it for others also.

1114
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,799
You want to help others, you want to talk about it, work it out.

1115
01:07:45,999 --> 01:07:48,000
This is sort of a, the collective,

1116
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:53,400
we can say the collective generosity starts,

1117
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,280
and you start working it out for others, you talk to other people

1118
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:00,920
and you start raising their Kundalini, helping them and all that.

1119
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,799
As a result of that you can become very powerful.

1120
01:08:04,999 --> 01:08:09,280
You can even control the elements, so many things you can control,

1121
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,640
and it's limitless,

1122
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,920
because it is something really

1123
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:19,520
that is, we can say is beyond our conception

1124
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,999
how far we can go. It's tremendous.

1125
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,920
Just to follow that,

1126
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,560
how would I personally work

1127
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,600
towards realizing this state more and more and more strongly,

1128
01:08:32,999 --> 01:08:36,280
this state of doubtless awareness? How do I

1129
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:40,080
surrender myself more and more? What things would I do?

1130
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:43,720
For that Buddha has told you that "Sangam sharanam gacchami"

1131
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,480
- you have to come in the collective.

1132
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:50,080
It works in the collective, because it's the work of the collective.

1133
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,120
Once you are with the collective, all the collective is growing

1134
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,640
and with that you grow.

1135
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,360
So you have to be in the collective.

1136
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,799
If you sit at home, do meditation, you won't grow.

1137
01:09:00,999 --> 01:09:03,200
You have to be in the collective, that's all.

1138
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,799
And in the collective you just ascend very easily,

1139
01:09:06,999 --> 01:09:08,999
no problem.

1140
01:09:09,999 --> 01:09:11,840
Some people have touched so fast,

1141
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:15,640
and some people are still little bit not there,

1142
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:19,840
but because those who are higher, they just pull them up.

1143
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,040
It's a collective happening.

1144
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,720
So being out among the people ... ?

1145
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,799
Yes, all those who are realized souls

1146
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:32,920
- must mix with them, talk to them, be with them,

1147
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,760
you should sing songs,

1148
01:09:34,999 --> 01:09:36,999
and they enjoy together, it's very enjoyable.

1149
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:40,040
The way they enjoy each other is very wonderful.

1150
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,960
I'll quote a beautiful poem written by

1151
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:48,999
one very famous poet, Namadeva, who was just a tailor,

1152
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,880
and was very much appreciated by Nanaka,

1153
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,680
and he said that "Now you better write in Punjabi language".

1154
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:58,799
So he wrote such a big book of things in Punjabi language,

1155
01:09:58,999 --> 01:10:01,440
and is used in the Guru Granth Sahib.

1156
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,480
He was a poet from Maharashtra.

1157
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,799
So one day he went to see another realized soul,

1158
01:10:07,999 --> 01:10:10,880
who was a potter.

1159
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,799
His name was Gora Kumbhar,

1160
01:10:12,999 --> 01:10:16,799
and this potter was busy kneading his clay

1161
01:10:16,999 --> 01:10:19,160
to make pots.

1162
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,799
Namadeva saw him there,

1163
01:10:21,999 --> 01:10:24,520
looked at him, he was so stunned.

1164
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:28,600
He says, "I came here to see the nirakara,

1165
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,120
to see the formless, and here it is in form."

1166
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,200
What an appreciation, what a adoration,

1167
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,999
and what an understanding of each other!

1168
01:10:45,999 --> 01:10:48,720
But they were so few.

1169
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,160
They were all tortured and troubled, I must say, terrible things,

1170
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,480
because people didn't understand them.

1171
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,960
And whatever they say is the truth.

1172
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,720
Every word that they said is the truth.

1173
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,160
So to Rachel and Michelle.

1174
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,799
I gather that You have

1175
01:11:18,999 --> 01:11:21,680
many communities and followers around the world.

1176
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,799
- Yes. 
- I wonder if You could tell us

1177
01:11:23,999 --> 01:11:26,040
a bit about them, how many do You have?

1178
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,999
When did it start, when did You

1179
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,600
[came] at the head of the movement?

1180
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:36,320
I'm very bad at accounts, that's one thing I don't know.

1181
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,960
I'm hopeless at it. Really I don't understand accounts,

1182
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:43,760
I don't understand banking, I cannot sign a check,

1183
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:45,799
I'm so hopelessly bad;

1184
01:11:45,999 --> 01:11:49,480
and I just don't know how I don't know these things,

1185
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,120
how to keep an account.

1186
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,320
Then perhaps recount how You became aware

1187
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,640
that You had something very special to teach to others, and....

1188
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,999
I was born like this,

1189
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,840
just born.

1190
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,799
And You always have a following?

1191
01:12:05,999 --> 01:12:08,920
I mean, My father was a realized soul

1192
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,999
so he understood it,

1193
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,920
and I met some saints also.

1194
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:21,600
But nobody was so anxious to work it out,

1195
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,999
because they were frightened of the society.

1196
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,720
Most of them had disappeared to Himalayas

1197
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,960
or some places, and they wouldn't come down.

1198
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,800
They said, "It's a big venture. You try Your luck!"

1199
01:12:48,999 --> 01:12:51,840
This university is full of people who are

1200
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,480
very much committed to bookish knowledge.

1201
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,280
I mean we learn so much, we read so much,

1202
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,999
and I think maybe some people do it for degree or for position.

1203
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,799
But I think quite a lot are really devoted

1204
01:13:04,999 --> 01:13:07,520
to just read more and more and understand it more

1205
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,440
in an intellectual way.

1206
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:13,120
Now what role do You assign to this kind of pursuit,

1207
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,600
intellectual pursuit?

1208
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:18,680
Because if you ask people if they want to be realized,

1209
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,080
maybe they say, "Ah, not really," but they pursue the books.

1210
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:26,920
So what do You see, what's the role of pursuing text and books?

1211
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,920
You see, if you read books only,

1212
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,800
then you get lost in the words, not in reality.

1213
01:13:34,999 --> 01:13:37,120
And we had so many like that,

1214
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:41,400
you see, great scholars, very first class first

1215
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,720
and PhDs and MAds, all kinds of people

1216
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,999
came down to Sahaja Yoga.

1217
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,480
Very learned.

1218
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,560
But there was one thing common about them,

1219
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,799
they had a kind of an intelligence to see

1220
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:59,400
that there's something beyond.

1221
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,960
That's all. And it clicked in them, so many of them.

1222
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,400
So it's not difficult.

1223
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:11,760
You have not wasted your energy at all,

1224
01:14:11,999 --> 01:14:14,960
but it's like whatever you have read

1225
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,799
has to be re-read

1226
01:14:17,999 --> 01:14:20,680
with a torch in your hand.

1227
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:25,000
There is one gentleman called as Yogi Mahajan.

1228
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:31,400
He's a lawyer, his father was a Chief Justice of India,

1229
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,360
of the Supreme Court,

1230
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,880
very learned person,

1231
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,160
and he had written lots of books also.

1232
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,880
He came to Sahaja Yoga,

1233
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,640
so then he wrote another book

1234
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,920
called as Gita Enlightened.

1235
01:14:50,999 --> 01:14:54,999
Now there's another muslim gentleman

1236
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:59,999
in Paris, Javed his name is. He's an aeronautical engineer.

1237
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,760
He's writing Koran Enlightened.

1238
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,920
There's somebody else who's writing Bible Enlightened.

1239
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,880
Their education is not wasted.

1240
01:15:17,999 --> 01:15:19,999
Education is a technique,

1241
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,320
but the creativity comes from your Spirit.

1242
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,280
It would be like the glass is the education,

1243
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,800
but you have to have water in it,

1244
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,840
then it's complete.

1245
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,799
Now, John.

1246
01:15:35,999 --> 01:15:39,600
I've just had a question 
going through my mind

1247
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,440
when You were answering Rachel's last question,

1248
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:46,680
which is this: since Your centers for ...

1249
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,799
or what would You call Your centers anyway?

1250
01:15:50,999 --> 01:15:52,720
What would you call Your centers?

1251
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,799
- Myself? 
- Like Your centers, the shakti...

1252
01:15:55,999 --> 01:15:57,240
- [What centers are]?

1253
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,720
How would you describe, you know, the different centers?

1254
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,680
It's a shakti, it's a power, it's an energy.

1255
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,480
No, I'm referring to the places where You go and...

1256
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:07,800
Oh, I see, you're talking about the geographical centers.

1257
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:13,999
How would You refer to Your worshipping groups,

1258
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,600
Your worshipping, the worshipping community

1259
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,799
like in Sydney, is there a name that would be?

1260
01:16:18,999 --> 01:16:20,999
Yes, they're all My children, I call them.

1261
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,920
Well, what if we ask You a question like this:

1262
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,320
"Are among Your children, say, Christian priests?"

1263
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,520
A few were ecumenical obviously.

1264
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,560
I mean, do they come there looking for Realization?

1265
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,720
In other words apply what they have learned

1266
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,799
or bring with them what they have learned,

1267
01:16:35,999 --> 01:16:39,960
and try to lift it to another plane in Your community?

1268
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:45,240
Are there any Christian priests among Your children,

1269
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,040
which...  as far as I know there are...

1270
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:51,600
Of course there are, there are - three of them.

1271
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,640
And one was a very high priest in Italy.

1272
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,680
- Italy? 
- Yes.

1273
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:04,999
In Italy there's a deviation now little bit coming up.

1274
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:13,040
Recently I read a book about when Christ was in India,

1275
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:16,920
it is a nice book written by a German priest,

1276
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,720
and I think he's a realized soul because

1277
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,680
he knows so many things and he says so many things

1278
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,160
which only a realized soul can say.

1279
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,360
Of course he is a scholar,

1280
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,799
so he has authentically shown that Christ was there.

1281
01:17:30,999 --> 01:17:33,040
But the way he has discussed Paul in Christianity

1282
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:36,440
and all that is remarkable, remarkable.

1283
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,680
But with great power.

1284
01:17:38,999 --> 01:17:43,120
Even Khalil Gibran has discussed Paul.

1285
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,999
They can see through things.

1286
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:53,280
He's not My disciple, but definitely he's a realized soul.

1287
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,120
He's a priest.

1288
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,760
We have one priest in London

1289
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,999
who tried to bring

1290
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:09,999
Bishop of Canterbury,

1291
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,360
and I must say that he sent his

1292
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,080
adviser to one of My lectures.

1293
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,200
I never knew he was sitting

1294
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,240
but that day, I don't know why,

1295
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,320
I started talking about something

1296
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,880
that was not Christianity

1297
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,840
in the Christians' behavior,

1298
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,999
and he got very angry and he went away.

1299
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:41,080
I said that Christ has said, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes."

1300
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,400
What a subtle thing to say,

1301
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,799
because in Sahaja Yoga Christ is placed on the optic chiasma,

1302
01:18:46,999 --> 01:18:48,799
on the cross.

1303
01:18:48,999 --> 01:18:51,799
He's the one who sucks in our karmas,

1304
01:18:51,999 --> 01:18:54,280
that's why He talked of the eyes

1305
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,680
- "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes" - very subtle.

1306
01:18:58,999 --> 01:19:02,400
Not only the mind, but even the eyes.

1307
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,440
And what about the Christian nations, what we see today?

1308
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:11,480
I mean it's horrid, I must say.

1309
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:14,960
Some things are very immoral, very immoral.

1310
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,160
Like in France now they are saying it should be allowed

1311
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,280
for housewives to be prostitutes parties.

1312
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,440
Even the word "sexy" for women, I don't like it at all.

1313
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:29,999
They are not prostitutes, why should they be sexy?

1314
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,440
It's a question of self-esteem.

1315
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,440
I mean if you call any Indian woman sexy she will just slap you,

1316
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,520
[being angry]. She'll be so angry for such a thing.

1317
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,320
She is not a prostitute.

1318
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,320
So the whole society which is,

1319
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,920
which is coming from Christ

1320
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,120
is going towards where?

1321
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,280
They are worshipping Freud, not Christ.

1322
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,440
Freud is their guru, not Christ.

1323
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,799
But when you come to Sahaja Yoga you'd be surprised,

1324
01:20:06,999 --> 01:20:09,840
your eyes get steady, your attention gets steady;

1325
01:20:10,999 --> 01:20:15,480
you really become a Christian in the real sense of the word,

1326
01:20:17,999 --> 01:20:20,680
because you get the actualization of baptism,

1327
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:22,880
it's not artificial.

1328
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:28,320
As William Blake has said that "Some priest cursed me on my head,

1329
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,520
and I suffered."

1330
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,800
It's not that.

1331
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,999
It's the actualization which takes place.

1332
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,999
All right? Thank you.

1333
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,520
- So this is, the time, is the time to... 
- All right?

1334
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:54,760
Thank you very much. I hope you will come to our program

1335
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,799
which we are having - I don't know where, again the same problem!

1336
01:20:58,999 --> 01:21:01,640
They just fix Me like plug, you know,

1337
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,999
and I don't know where I have to go, what I have to do.

1338
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:09,360
They push Me in the car, they push Me in the aeroplanes!

1339
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,440
- Do you want to have Realization?

1340
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,240
Well, the program is tomorrow night

1341
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:19,120
at the Hilton Hotel ballroom, at 7.30.

1342
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:22,000
Rather too posh for Me.

1343
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,799
Hilton Hotel!

1344
01:21:25,999 --> 01:21:28,920
All right, must be some reason.

1345
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,360
And Saturday night there are two programs,

1346
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,480
one following up at the same venue

1347
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,080
at the same time on Saturday night.

1348
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,760
Please make it convenient to come,

1349
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,999
because I'll come only after one year here,

1350
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,800
and I hope all of you should get your Realization,

1351
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,799
it's very important.

1352
01:21:49,999 --> 01:21:52,160
And then you will understand

1353
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,999
between the lines,

1354
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,760
the enlightened scriptures.

1355
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:09,160
Actually, I'd like to say a few words to those who are studying.

1356
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,480
I was doing my Masters in Philosophy

1357
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,960
in Bombay University,

1358
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:19,080
and I used to read like all of you, I suppose,

1359
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,999
and after reading I came to a point where

1360
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,600
you see that you're still far away from the reality,

1361
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:27,999
from the truth.

1362
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,520
I mean, you take one theory

1363
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,680
and you see and you feel that this is the best.

1364
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,840
You read another thing, you feel this is the best.

1365
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,400
But the two might be absolutely contradictory.

1366
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,800
So what is the truth?

1367
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,040
And by just reading the books

1368
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,720
I think, I personally thought that

1369
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,999
this is not what I really want from the academics.

1370
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,200
And that is where I came to Sahaj,

1371
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,799
and I have experienced

1372
01:22:53,999 --> 01:22:56,720
a lot through blessings of Shri Mataji.

1373
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:01,080
And I welcome, I mean I wish that all the seekers would

1374
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,080
should ask for their Realization,

1375
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:06,040
if they really are seeking for the knowledge. Thank you.

1376
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,720
Now the theories that look contradictory

1377
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,840
actually integrate after Sahaja Yoga,

1378
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,640
absolutely integrate. I'll give you an example.

1379
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,840
Now supposing if I have all the powers,

1380
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:20,799
I'm the greatest capitalist.

1381
01:23:20,999 --> 01:23:23,880
But I can't live without distributing it,

1382
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,999
so I'm the greatest communist.

1383
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:30,040
If you don't have the capital, how can you distribute it?

1384
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,999
But the capital of spirituality is important,

1385
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:36,160
not these worldly things - these are transitory.

1386
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,799
All these theories that look contradictory

1387
01:23:40,999 --> 01:23:42,799
actually are integrated.

1388
01:23:42,999 --> 01:23:47,799
All religions which look contradictory, they all integrate.

1389
01:23:47,999 --> 01:23:50,799
Actually we get integrated within ourselves,

1390
01:23:50,999 --> 01:23:53,999
complete integration takes place.

1391
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:59,080
So you don't have to deny any religion, you don't have to

1392
01:23:59,999 --> 01:24:03,400
argue it out, but you have to see for yourself the truth,

1393
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,999
that they are all one - no difference at all.

1394
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,160
That was the time it had to be done,

1395
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,040
this was the time it was to be done.

1396
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,520
Now this is the time of Kundalini awakening,

1397
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,320
so I talk of Kundalini awakening.

1398
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,040
This is not the time when I have to

1399
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,120
take the Jews out of somewhere.

1400
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:21,799
That Moses had to do.

1401
01:24:21,999 --> 01:24:23,760
So this is another work.

1402
01:24:23,999 --> 01:24:25,400
Whatever is the time,

1403
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:29,799
the maturity of the Tree of Life, one has to do that way,

1404
01:24:29,999 --> 01:24:32,440
and that's how it works out.

1405
01:24:32,999 --> 01:24:36,799
So thank you very much, very kind of you to have invited Me,

1406
01:24:36,999 --> 01:24:40,160
I'm really enamored that people of such intelligence

1407
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:44,320
should pay some attention to Sahaja Yoga, which is very humble.

1408
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,560
Thank You so much for coming.

1409
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,560
Thank you very much.
