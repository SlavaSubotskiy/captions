1
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:45,500
I am overjoyed really today

2
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,542
to see you all here

3
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:53,999
to celebrate the Diwali Puja.

4
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:59,792
We were to be in Portugal

5
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:03,959
but it was not so - so we are here.

6
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,417
Diwali Puja is a very small puja

7
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,000
but extremely significant.

8
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,709
Firstly in Diwali,

9
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:25,083
the first day they buy something

10
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,625
for the family.

11
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:35,792
You can - maybe some cooking utensil could be,

12
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:38,667
an ornament for the wife

13
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,625
or something like that.

14
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:47,917
Because that is the day of housewife.

15
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,999
And that day is to be celebrated

16
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:59,917
as the housewife’s, I should say, homage to her.

17
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:06,875
As a result you know in India even now

18
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,792
housewives are very much respected.

19
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:12,959
Actually they are respected all over.

20
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:19,291
You will be amazed that even

21
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,542
in the protocol of the government

22
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,792
receptions anywhere

23
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:31,999
the wife is very important.

24
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,166
And where she is sitting,

25
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,750
what is her position is very important.

26
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,125
Even today

27
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:44,542
in the most modern and advanced countries also

28
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,625
they have a special respect for the housewife.

29
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:50,999
The housewife may not be educated,

30
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:55,375
she may be a very simple woman,

31
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,291
she may not be very modern.

32
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:05,000
There was an experience for Me:

33
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:09,542
in London we had a program

34
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,417
where we all were invited,

35
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:20,500
and the head of the delegation,

36
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:23,041
his wife was missing.

37
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,208
So they asked Me, “Where is she?"

38
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:30,417
Because there is a seat for her, she has to sit there.

39
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,250
I said, “I don’t know, I didn’t see her.

40
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,583
She must be somewhere here.”

41
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,542
So just before starting

42
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:45,792
I went to the washing room

43
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:47,792
and I was surprised

44
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:50,792
she was sitting in the waiting room there.

45
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,917
I said, “What are you doing here?

46
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,875
They are all waiting for you outside.”

47
00:09:56,041 --> 00:10:00,083
So she said, “They asked me to sit here.”

48
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,000
So I went out and I told them

49
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,875
“Now she is sitting there. Why…

50
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,250
why don’t you call her to sit in her seat?”

51
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,542
“Is she the wife?”

52
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,709
I said, “Yes, of course, she is the wife.”

53
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:15,625
“We thought she was some secretary.”

54
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:17,542
I said, “What made you think?”

55
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,750
This lady had, you see, very modern ideas -

56
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,917
wearing a very modern slick dress and all that and

57
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,417
and everybody thought

58
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,417
this lady must be the secretary at the most.

59
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,667
So they made her sit in the waiting room.

60
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:38,542
You see - So it is expected of a housewife

61
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,750
to be decently dressed, honorably dressed

62
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,208
and not to dress up like a secretary

63
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:51,875
or somebody who is just in the office.

64
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:55,041
Because she is regarded as the highest -

65
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,625
whether you like it or not.

66
00:10:57,834 --> 00:11:00,667
But she had permed her hair

67
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,500
and she has been to a very expensive place

68
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:07,000
for all decorations and everything.

69
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,291
And poor thing, when she arrived

70
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,083
they put her in the waiting room near the bathroom.

71
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,542
That’s what it is.

72
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,500
So for a housewife,

73
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:24,375
she is the dignity of the household.

74
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,625
Not only that, but she is responsible

75
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:33,500
for the complete culture of that country,

76
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:37,917
complete culture of that country.

77
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,875
They represent the culture.

78
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:44,999
Like in India nowadays they have started

79
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,417
in the films showing all kinds of funny, funny dresses.

80
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,709
But I haven’t seen any housewife wearing that.

81
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:53,625
I haven’t seen anybody.

82
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,583
It’s not in reality, it’s only in the film,

83
00:11:56,792 --> 00:12:00,208
because the society is so strong

84
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:05,208
and the housewife is supposed to be a decent person.

85
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:06,667
She has to be decent,

86
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:10,999
she has to be very dignified

87
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,959
and she has to behave in a dignified manner.

88
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,999
On the contrary I would say,

89
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,875
we had a prime minister called Lal Bahadur Shastri.

90
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,000
His wife was absolutely uneducated

91
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,417
because Shastriji went to jail

92
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,792
and she couldn’t take her education -

93
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,458
very simple, ordinary woman.

94
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:36,166
And she went to France.

95
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,709
That time there was this Mr. de Gaulle,

96
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:41,917
he was the president.

97
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,500
And his wife was another very simple woman.

98
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:47,417
So Shastriji told her

99
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,959
that “You are not to cry when you are leaving Mrs. de Gaulle,

100
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,625
now you’ve become great friends.”

101
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,542
God knows she didn’t know French

102
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,375
and she didn’t know Hindi,

103
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,709
but somehow both of them became great friends,

104
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:02,709
on the level of housewives.

105
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:08,458
And when he warned her not to cry,

106
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,625
what happened that they started crying

107
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,375
when they had to leave.

108
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,999
So Shastriji said, “I told you not to cry."

109
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,291
She said, “It is she, this French lady started crying.

110
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,917
What can I do? I had to cry with her.”

111
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:28,208
So you see, it’s a kind of a great

112
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:31,250
collectivity of housewives

113
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,500
that has to work out.

114
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,291
They have common problems,

115
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,458
they have to face their children,

116
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:42,208
they have to look after the household,

117
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:46,000
everything – I mean there are so many common problems

118
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,208
with the housewives.

119
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,917
And the housewife also

120
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,583
knows all little, little things.

121
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:57,250
You see, men at least in India don’t know much

122
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:01,208
because they live in the air, I think.

123
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:04,250
So the women have more sense

124
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,250
in this respect, for small, small things

125
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,500
they are quite aware.

126
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,083
It’s very interesting sometimes,

127
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,625
the men commit mistakes

128
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:21,542
of such a great humor.

129
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,250
Because they do not deal with day-to-day life,

130
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,959
with all the problems of daily life.

131
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,000
On one side the woman,

132
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,917
housewife, has to deal with the daily life.

133
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:42,333
On the other side she has to look after her family,

134
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:44,166
her children.

135
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,959
Also, poor thing, she is responsible

136
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,125
for the society.

137
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,166
She has to maintain the society.

138
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,834
In a country where women are sensible

139
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,375
and are matured,

140
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,834
you will be amazed that they become

141
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,250
extremely good families,

142
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,792
good societies and good children.

143
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:09,625
That’s why I must say,

144
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:14,834
India is a very good country of very good society.

145
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,750
This is come out of the housewives,

146
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,458
the Gruha Lakshmis of the house,

147
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:26,000
who have done all the work that is important

148
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,959
as far as the culture is concerned.

149
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:33,999
This kind of thing is very much in India

150
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,834
and with that, what you find

151
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:42,166
that the people respect,

152
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:45,375
respect the housewives.

153
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,583
So respecting the housewife

154
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:53,041
is the most important thing in our Sahaj culture.

155
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,417
But that doesn’t mean that

156
00:15:56,625 --> 00:16:01,375
the women should try to dominate and trouble

157
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,375
and fight with the husbands.

158
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:10,375
But it means a very important position

159
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:14,083
in the society, of a housewife.

160
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:20,875
She is treated as a something a, like a devi only.

161
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,917
But she too has to be a devi.

162
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,208
If you treat her like a doormat,

163
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:30,208
then children will never respect her.

164
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:33,999
If you don’t pay proper respect to her,

165
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,458
the children won’t respect the mother

166
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,750
and there will be no impact

167
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,458
of the mother on the children.

168
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:45,999
As a result the children get wayward,

169
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,750
and in the societies or in the countries

170
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:52,999
where the mother is not respected,

171
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:58,291
you will find the children become extremely dominating,

172
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,542
hot-tempered and horribly uncollective.

173
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,250
So it’s very important that on this day

174
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,333
we call it Dhanteras - the thirteenth day -

175
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:14,125
you have to buy something for your wife,

176
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,583
and you have to give her something as a present.

177
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:22,291
At least you should buy a little pot

178
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,667
or something that can be used in the kitchen

179
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,417
to show your respect to her.

180
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,875
In the families where mother is not respected

181
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:36,458
children become extremely troublesome

182
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,959
and the whole, their family also suffers -

183
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,417
wherever they are married, whatever happens to them.

184
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,583
Men have to realize, it is their mistake

185
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:51,625
that they have never respected their wife as they should have.

186
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:54,583
In the presence of the children if they shout,

187
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:59,250
in the presence of the children if they don’t show any respect,

188
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:03,291
the children can never respect the mother.

189
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,792
It is something, a criminal thing to do

190
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,834
to women who are in the household

191
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,959
doing all the work for you,

192
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,875
looking after you, your family,

193
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,208
not demanding anything.

194
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,500
Only if you want to understand

195
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:23,375
how they can be troublesome,

196
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,792
is see them in the politics.

197
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:30,333
When they go in the politics they put all men upside-down.

198
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:35,792
And one woman can put all of them in their proper senses.

199
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:40,875
Because their field is their house, their family.

200
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,417
If they are not respected in the family,

201
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,583
they get out of the family

202
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,625
and behave in such manner that you can’t imagine.

203
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:52,083
Though she has to bear a lot,

204
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,792
she has to suffer a lot,

205
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:58,500
but in the family she must be respected.

206
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:04,667
That’s a very, very important message of Gruha Lakshmi.

207
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:10,667
Then the second day is the one where

208
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:16,542
this horrible rakshasa called as Narakasura was killed.

209
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:23,250
Always all killing is done with the power of the Shakti.

210
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:29,542
This Narakasura was the fellow who had tortured so many people

211
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,583
and had done lots of cunning stuff.

212
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:36,375
He was a very treacherous, cunning man

213
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:40,458
and it was impossible to kill him.

214
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,417
But then somehow or other,

215
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:47,375
with the advent of a special power

216
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,417
that this Narakasura was killed.

217
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:55,083
That was the another day, fourth day,

218
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,917
where Narakasura was killed.

219
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:01,583
They say that when he was killed,

220
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:05,458
the door of hell was closed.

221
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:09,417
So people should take their baths early in the morning.

222
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,875
But I am of the opinion

223
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:15,542
that day if the door is open, better not take bath.

224
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,750
Be in your beds

225
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:23,333
till this fellow is put fully into narak.

226
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:26,291
You should not bother about him.

227
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,291
“Naraka” means hell.

228
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,875
And from the hell

229
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:35,291
they extracted him and killed him.

230
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,834
The last one is the best,

231
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
where they have the meeting of Shri Rama

232
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,083
and His brother Bharat.

233
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,792
Shri Rama went to jail, obeying His father.

234
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,667
And for fourteen years

235
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,542
He was – not a jail but in a, we could say,

236
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,792
He went in the forest

237
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:01,542
as a - it was a kind of a jail only, because

238
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,417
He was living in the palaces and He was sent in the

239
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,166
forest by His father

240
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,999
and his daughter-in-law;

241
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,792
also I mean it’s His own wife.

242
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:19,959
And also the brother, they went together

243
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,291
into great sufferings.

244
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,542
And you know the whole story of Ramayana.

245
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,542
The child

246
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,291
that lived in the palaces

247
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
had to go in the forest

248
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:40,291
and live in terrible conditions,

249
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,333
when He was to be the king.

250
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,458
Was too much.

251
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,458
But Sita went with Him

252
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:52,250
and She supported Him

253
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:57,041
and ultimately it so happened that

254
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:05,999
Ravana came and took away Sita.

255
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,375
But Shri Rama fought Ravana,

256
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:12,000
killed him and brought back His wife.

257
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,083
But when they came back

258
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:18,750
to their own capital in Ayodhya,

259
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:20,875
there was a big jubilation

260
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,333
and Bharat, His brother -

261
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,750
he was very much attached to his brother

262
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:29,999
and he ruled that country

263
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,417
with the paduka -

264
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:38,792
they say is the kind of sandalwood chappals

265
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:41,583
they use – of his brother.

266
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:45,291
He put it on the throne and ruled.

267
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,125
So that is how the Bharat milan-

268
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,792
the meeting of Bharat with Shri Rama-

269
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:52,083
is celebrated,

270
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:55,083
and that was the time He was crowned also

271
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,625
as the king.

272
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,250
So it is long time back,

273
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:59,834
thousands of years back

274
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,417
this thing has happened.

275
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:05,542
That jubilation is very significant

276
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,750
that the right king gets His own throne,

277
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,917
and He rules.

278
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:13,458
And all the injustice

279
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:18,083
and all kind of atrocities He has gone through

280
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:22,500
has to be completely finished from His life.

281
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:26,417
And that’s why Diwali is important.

282
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:32,208
So the last day they worship the Goddess Lakshmi.

283
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:34,458
Because it is Her blessings

284
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:38,709
that brought forth all these beautiful meetings.

285
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:43,166
And that’s why they worship Her, Lakshmi, as such.

286
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:47,999
But there are nine types of Lakshmis within us,

287
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:51,458
which I think I have told you sometimes back.

288
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:56,083
Now in that Lakshmi Puja is this, that

289
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:58,583
you worship the Lakshmi Herself.

290
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,625
It doesn’t mean money,

291
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:01,917
not at all.

292
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,125
To worship money is wrong.

293
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,291
But what it means that

294
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,792
Lakshmi is the money which is with us -

295
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:13,333
or the whatever prosperity with that -

296
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:15,917
should be very carefully spent,

297
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:19,959
because She is very mobile

298
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,041
and the money can slip out.

299
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:27,208
On the contrary you should not be at all miserly.

300
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:30,542
Miserly people – Lakshmi is not happy.

301
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,417
But if you want to spend,

302
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,792
you must spend it in the right way,

303
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:39,208
otherwise the money is spent in the wrong way.

304
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:48,792
Now when the Lakshmi was created -

305
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:49,792
you must be knowing

306
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:53,083
out of the churning of the sea She came out.

307
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,999
She had four hands,

308
00:24:57,166 --> 00:25:00,458
one hand was to give.

309
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,500
She is generous, She gives.

310
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,000
Like this She gives,

311
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:10,083
and with one hand She blesses.

312
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:11,999
These are Her two hands.

313
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:15,667
One is to give, and to bless the person.

314
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:19,667
Very important it is,

315
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:24,208
that when you give to somebody something,

316
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:26,291
you forget about it,

317
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,917
and you bless that person.

318
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,625
Not only you give money,

319
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:33,999
but also you bless that person.

320
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,291
The other two hands

321
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,500
have got two lotuses of pink color.

322
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,625
Pink is the color of love.

323
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:49,999
And a person who has money

324
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:52,999
should have a house

325
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:56,333
which is full of love.

326
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,875
Any guest who comes in the house

327
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:01,166
should be respected.

328
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:06,166
He should be treated just like God.

329
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:08,834
In India you have noticed how

330
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,166
they think foreigners -

331
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,291
“foreigners” means God to them.

332
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,291
Here “foreigner” is a bad word,

333
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,709
but in India is very respectable.

334
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:18,125
If you are a foreigner

335
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,458
means that you are God.

336
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:24,000
How they have looked after you, you know that, in India.

337
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,583
This is the reason,

338
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,999
this is the basic culture of India

339
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:31,542
that anybody who is a guest -

340
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,834
he may be anything -

341
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,125
if he is a guest

342
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:37,417
then he is to be treated like God.

343
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:41,458
In the other countries it’s just the other way round, you know.

344
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,875
If you are a foreigner

345
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:48,417
then people think it’s not even proper to talk to that person.

346
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:52,750
I don’t know how the mentality is like that.

347
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,792
But not in Sahaja Yoga.

348
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:11,999
Sahaja yogis are not like that.

349
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:18,417
They treat the guests very well, I’ve heard.

350
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,375
They look after each other

351
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:23,834
and they are beautifully collective.

352
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:29,917
So this is what is the meaning of the lotus,

353
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,709
is a house full of love.

354
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:37,208
Like a beetle which has got even thorns,

355
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:41,542
when it comes to the lotus, the lotus open out

356
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,375
and the beetle goes inside

357
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:47,583
and sleeps very nicely and comfortably.

358
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,208
Even the beetle - undisturbed.

359
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:55,208
That is how one should treat, if you have money.

360
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:57,792
But here what I find

361
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:00,208
in the world now, if you have money

362
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:03,208
you become yourself like a beetle.

363
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,999
They’re so full of thorns and horrible ideas,

364
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:10,999
so insulting, and think no end of yourself.

365
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:13,250
It’s just surprising is

366
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,792
that money which should give them

367
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:19,750
the form of Lakshmi

368
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,291
- Lakshmi Swarupa -

369
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
they become like devils.

370
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:28,500
And the way they treat other people is even worse than that.

371
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:33,999
So these are the significance of the form of the Goddess.

372
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:37,542
But the best is, She’s just standing on the lotus.

373
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,583
That means no pressure on anyone.

374
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:43,542
She exists on Her own - no pressure.

375
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,875
She doesn’t put any pressure on anyone,

376
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:50,333
just on Her own She stands

377
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:56,999
and all Her weight and all balanced on Her own dignity.

378
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:00,792
This is the way a Lakshmi should be.

379
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:04,000
And that’s how, if it is, when happens

380
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:07,792
in the countries where people are having now financial crisis

381
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:12,125
and all kinds of crisis, things will improve.

382
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:16,500
People will enjoy. They don’t enjoy their money, nothing.

383
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:20,583
They don’t enjoy. This is just aggressiveness

384
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:23,000
and also funny ideas

385
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:28,458
of having a, something, very expensive things

386
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:33,583
and what you call the designers.

387
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:37,750
Now I think these are designers are anti-Lakshmi,

388
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,458
that they have come.

389
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:43,291
Because they are extracting all your money nicely

390
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,417
and all your money goes to waste.

391
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:52,375
If not that, then people take to womanizing or to drinking -

392
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,333
such wasteful habits.

393
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,709
They don’t do anything which we can call as

394
00:29:57,917 --> 00:30:00,625
really the blessing of the Lakshmi.

395
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:03,834
So one has to remember

396
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,583
that when you want to give something to someone

397
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:10,583
do it with the full heart.

398
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,792
Such full heart that

399
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:16,500
it forms that Lakshmi Prasada.

400
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:18,999
You see, that should happen, otherwise

401
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:22,792
what’s the use of giving presents to anyone?

402
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:25,750
You see, they are very funny people, you know

403
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:31,375
who give presents out of a very narrow outlook.

404
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:36,458
But they try to give presents.

405
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,500
Like in Japan, if you go,

406
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:40,792
they’ll give you such a big present.

407
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:44,999
You go on opening and opening and opening and opening it,

408
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:49,583
till you come to a point when you’ll get a matchbox.

409
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:52,291
In the matchbox - inside the matchbox,

410
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,417
you will take two,

411
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:01,875
you can say, it’s two doll-like things made out of

412
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:04,625
small little those matchsticks.

413
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:05,999
Start looking at them

414
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:10,959
“What this is, why such a big design?”

415
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:13,959
and very surprising.

416
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:17,709
But they are very simple people otherwise, very simple.

417
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:21,083
When we went there, they told us

418
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:26,458
they – wherever we went, you know even in a shop when it was raining

419
00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:28,125
they would give us a present.

420
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:29,667
Now I said, “What is this?

421
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:32,583
Why are they giving us a present like this?”

422
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:35,667
So the lady who was translating, she said

423
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:38,208
“They think You are from a royal family.”

424
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:41,917
I said, “What makes them feel we are from a royal family?”

425
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,999
“Because You don’t go to hairdresser.”

426
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,250
I said, “Really?”

427
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:52,083
“Yes. In Japan, royal family people never go to a hairdresser.”

428
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:56,417
I said, “I didn’t know this, that they don’t go to the hairdresser.”

429
00:31:56,667 --> 00:32:00,000
“That’s why they think, You are from the royal family.”

430
00:32:00,208 --> 00:32:05,125
Just imagine what ideas people have about

431
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,917
hairdressing and all that.

432
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:14,208
But in India or these places

433
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:18,750
a woman must be properly combed - her hair.

434
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:21,792
She shouldn’t look like a hippie going round, you know.

435
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:25,750
Because we have many people who

436
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:28,417
still believe in a kind of a hippieism

437
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:32,291
and they wear their hairdress like that.

438
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,999
Now, woman plays a very big part in the society as I told you.

439
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:41,000
Whatever way she wears, whatever where she goes about,

440
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,500
also the children pick up much more

441
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:46,458
then from the mother than from the father.

442
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:49,500
Sometimes could be much more from the father also.

443
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:53,125
But actually the, all the refined things

444
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:55,625
are picked up from the mother.

445
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:59,041
So it is more for the ladies

446
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:03,166
to understand how they dress up, how they live.

447
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:05,875
Nowadays – I went to London

448
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:08,250
and I’ve asked one Indian Sahaja yogini

449
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:10,208
“What is the fashion now?”

450
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:12,875
So she said “jipreya” in Marathi.

451
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:16,041
“Jipreya” means if you put your hair like this is.

452
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,500
See in India, if we have hair like this

453
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:21,625
the mother will say “Now remove your jipreyas.”

454
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:26,750
Because if you put like that hair your eyes can become squinty.

455
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:30,125
But that’s the fashion to put the hair like this, you see -

456
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:32,999
very much, sometimes on the eyes also.

457
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:35,083
So that’s a jipreya fashion.

458
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:38,709
And this now is quite common I find everybody

459
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:41,000
dignified ladies also,

460
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:42,959
except for Mrs. Thatcher,

461
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,667
everybody puts on this kind of a thing.

462
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:49,333
I don’t know how Mrs. Thatcher has escaped it.

463
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:52,375
But anybody who does anything

464
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,709
that should not be followed by women.

465
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:56,208
It’s very slavish.

466
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:58,917
Because this is the fashion, that’s why they do it.

467
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,166
That’s the fashion, so they do it.

468
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,959
It’s absolutely stupid to do that way

469
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,417
and to play into the hands of these people who make fashions.

470
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:09,750
Because you are independent.

471
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:11,959
You must stand on your own character.

472
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,959
you must stand on your own understanding of things.

473
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:17,834
Instead of ruining your faces

474
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,583
you should try to improve them

475
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:24,208
by your dignity, by your

476
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:27,750
understanding.

477
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:31,792
Now it’s more on the women - I am sorry to say -

478
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:34,750
Lakshmi Puja is more on the women

479
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,709
that what they have to understand,

480
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:40,375
what they have to be, how they should be.

481
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:44,792
I have always told you

482
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:49,417
that it’s necessary for a woman to be dignified,

483
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:51,999
very much more than the man.

484
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:54,917
Man can be stupid – doesn’t matter, you see,

485
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,417
doesn’t matter so much.

486
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:59,875
But women have to be dignified and sensible.

487
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:01,999
And men, as it is, don’t know much

488
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,667
as you know that very well.

489
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:04,959
Poor things, you know,

490
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,000
they are

491
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,291
They are educated only in the universities.

492
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,125
But as far as the practical side is concerned,

493
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:19,125
they don’t know anything.

494
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:25,792
So one should not feel bad about it.

495
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,542
I mean, it’s very enjoyable

496
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,125
to see the way men make mistake and

497
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:32,834
then they go on saying “No, no, I know this, I know that,”

498
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,041
and they don’t know anything!

499
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:44,000
So - But man will never say, “I don’t know.”

500
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,458
You see, that’s his character.

501
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:47,166
It’s all right.

502
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,875
You must know that he doesn’t mean it,

503
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,834
because he really doesn’t know anything!

504
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:06,000
Also in art.

505
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:10,041
I don’t think men know much about art,

506
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:17,583
and also their one side is missing is aesthetics.

507
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,291
Poor things, they make one type of clothes

508
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,583
wear all throughout.

509
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:27,792
Just one type of dresses they will make

510
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:31,083
and that they will make and wear throughout.

511
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,000
They don’t have any demand.

512
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,999
But women are artistic.

513
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:40,709
And if our Indian women give up wearing saris

514
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:44,291
and take to jeans, where will the villagers go?

515
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,083
Because they live with their saris that they make

516
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,959
during holidays and things like that.

517
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:53,458
So in India is not possible to introduce

518
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:55,750
all these dresses.

519
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:57,500
In the school maybe,

520
00:36:57,709 --> 00:37:01,458
but later on they all give up, because they like saris.

521
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:04,000
So the saris are still on

522
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:07,667
and will be on because it’s so artistic,

523
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,125
it’s so beautiful.

524
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:12,291
One sari doesn’t look like another sari.

525
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,875
So the idea of beauty and the idea of art

526
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:19,208
much more with the women, not with the men.

527
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:22,291
And so one should see that

528
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,375
if men don’t know, doesn’t matter.

529
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:30,999
But you make your houses absolutely artistic.

530
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:36,000
Make it comfortable like the lotus, as I said,

531
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,583
that should be such.

532
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:39,792
But some of the ladies

533
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:44,083
can be very much like a Hitler, you know,

534
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:46,542
in the household, very dictating.

535
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,375
“This should be like this, that should be like that,”

536
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:53,667
making the life of men absolutely miserable.

537
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,291
I have known a person

538
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,333
who used to carry a newspaper in his house.

539
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:01,583
So I said, “Why do you carry it all the time?”

540
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:02,917
He said, “Whenever I sit,

541
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:06,208
I put the newspaper first and then I sit.”

542
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:06,999
“Why?”

543
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:10,709
“Because if it is spoilt a little bit

544
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:13,083
my wife will shout at me.”

545
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,500
I said, “Why?”

546
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,667
“Because she doesn’t like anything to be spoilt.

547
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,333
So she’s so particular.

548
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:23,166
I carry a newspaper always with me -

549
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,917
wherever I have to sit I put the newspaper."

550
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,750
I said, “It’s too much.”

551
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:32,500
He said, “You will also have to do that, I tell You.”

552
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:43,792
So very particular about the whole house

553
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:47,625
that it’s impossible to live in that house.

554
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:50,625
It’s even worse than a hospital.

555
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:54,458
So some women can be very particular about that

556
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:58,125
and very methodical, could be.

557
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:03,417
But normally women should be very loving

558
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:06,667
and extremely accommodating,

559
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:11,667
and also being friendly with all the family members,

560
00:39:11,875 --> 00:39:13,709
with everyone.

561
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:18,792
It’s very important that I’ve a family so big.

562
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:21,417
We have a very large family,

563
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:24,166
so many brothers and sisters

564
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:28,417
and everybody one better than the other.

565
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:31,999
It is so remarkable that

566
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:37,291
everybody has a different type of a perfume, I think,

567
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,875
or a kind of a fragrance

568
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:43,583
that shows an individual personality in them.

569
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:47,667
Despite that they are all so nice and so good,

570
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:51,208
so accommodating and so much enjoying,

571
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:55,458
that it’s remarkable how people live together.

572
00:39:55,667 --> 00:40:00,125
Specially in Russia I found the women are very adaptable

573
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:01,875
and very humorous.

574
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:05,500
And they were making fun of everything

575
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:08,083
and enjoying life.

576
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:12,542
Very surprising, we had taken presents for them.

577
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,458
But we had taken for about two thousand people,

578
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:18,500
but there were sixteen thousand people.

579
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:22,166
So how could we give these presents?

580
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:24,750
So the women took out their chains

581
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:27,417
and they said, “All right, we’ll give it to men, all right.

582
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:31,208
We’ll give them our ear-tops, all right,”

583
00:40:31,417 --> 00:40:33,375
and they were making fun of men,

584
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:36,542
who were feeling bad that they couldn’t get anything.

585
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,583
Such fun, you know, such understanding.

586
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:43,875
Because they are not so money-oriented I think

587
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:48,709
and they are very spiritual-minded.

588
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:52,875
So a spiritual woman wouldn’t bother about other things like this

589
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,625
and will keep a dignity of her own

590
00:40:55,834 --> 00:40:59,667
and will show by her every gesture

591
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,709
that she is spiritual.

592
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,625
This is something so sweet, you know.

593
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:08,291
As I was telling you, on one side

594
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:10,417
sometimes you feel

595
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,625
a little different, say, I said it about Japan.

596
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:19,999
But in the same Japan when I went there,

597
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:22,917
I liked their tiles very much.

598
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:26,583
So they were building up something,

599
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:28,999
I liked the design of their tiles.

600
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:31,792
So I said, “Can I take one from here?”

601
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:37,041
“No, no, doesn’t matter. We’ll send it to Your ship.”

602
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,542
And on the ship a big load

603
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,959
of those tiles arrived.

604
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,417
And the captain asked Me, “Now what are we to do?”

605
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:46,999
I said, “How did you get it?”

606
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:48,750
He said, “They brought it to You.”

607
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:53,208
All kinds of varieties of those tiles,

608
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:55,041
can you imagine?

609
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,333
So on one side it is

610
00:41:57,542 --> 00:42:00,625
a way of expression,

611
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:03,917
on the other side is different.

612
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:06,625
So one should understand also.

613
00:42:06,834 --> 00:42:09,542
When somebody gives you something

614
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,500
you should understand

615
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:16,250
what is the significance of that,

616
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:18,625
and not to feel bad about it.

617
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:22,875
The significance of that could be very much great,

618
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,625
you may not understand.

619
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:28,834
So better to ask, why they have given you these things.

620
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,208
That is what is, what we call auspiciousness,

621
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:35,750
one of the great qualities of the Lakshmi is,

622
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:39,083
that it should be auspicious.

623
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:43,542
Whatever you give should be auspicious.

624
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,458
Like sometimes

625
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:48,041
I have seen little children out of mischief

626
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,250
will bring a lizard and try to give you.

627
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:53,834
I mean, it’s very inauspicious to do that.

628
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,750
But they are not told that it’s inauspicious,

629
00:42:56,959 --> 00:42:58,458
so they are doing like that.

630
00:42:58,667 --> 00:43:00,583
They have to be told it’s not auspicious,

631
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:02,750
it will not please the Goddess.

632
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:05,375
So that has to be understood very well

633
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:09,208
that you should not try to insult

634
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:13,375
the Lakshmi by giving something which is wrong.

635
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:15,834
If you don’t know, you should find out

636
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,041
and do it properly.

637
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,875
In this way this is the Diwali thing.

638
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:25,291
But the greatest message of this is

639
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:31,375
that the kingdom was given to Shri Rama.

640
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:37,208
Shri Rama was the embodiment of justice

641
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:39,500
and fair play.

642
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:42,125
And this was given to Him.

643
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:45,417
In the same way we have to feel

644
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:52,000
that our expression of gratitude,

645
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:59,166
our expression of love should be such that it should be

646
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:03,709
given to a person who is a symbol

647
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:06,959
of such greatness like Shri Ram.

648
00:44:07,999 --> 00:44:12,500
It’s a very, very subtle thing one should try to understand.

649
00:44:12,709 --> 00:44:14,625
If you don’t want to give, you should not give.

650
00:44:14,834 --> 00:44:18,083
But if you want to give, then you must give something

651
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:22,125
which is worth the person to whom you are giving.

652
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:25,500
That is one of the lessons you should have

653
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:32,166
about Shri Rama’s temperament.

654
00:44:32,709 --> 00:44:35,000
When He went into the village

655
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:37,999
and He found there was an old woman

656
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:43,917
and this old woman had all her teeth out practically.

657
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:47,999
And she was from the aboriginal

658
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:51,750
and she gave Him some

659
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:57,625
we call them “ber” - is something like

660
00:45:00,417 --> 00:45:03,625
is a kind of a fruit, small fruits.

661
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:08,166
And she said, “See, I have tasted all of them

662
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:11,250
and all of them are very sweet.

663
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:15,625
Because You should not have something which is not sweet.

664
00:45:15,834 --> 00:45:17,583
So I have tasted them with my tooth,

665
00:45:17,792 --> 00:45:21,375
I have put my tooth on to them and I have tasted it.

666
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:23,500
So please have them.”

667
00:45:23,709 --> 00:45:25,291
Immediately He took it.

668
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,999
But His brother Lakshmana got very angry

669
00:45:28,166 --> 00:45:30,667
that it’s very inauspicious in India,

670
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:32,959
if you have put something in the mouth

671
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:34,999
and then you want to give to somebody

672
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:38,458
is something [utishta ? ] – is not to be done.

673
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:42,041
But Shri Rama said

674
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,166
“I have never eaten such beautiful fruits.

675
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:48,417
They are the most beautiful fruits I have eaten.”

676
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:49,750
So His wife says

677
00:45:49,959 --> 00:45:53,959
“Also give Me some. After all, I am Your half

678
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:56,542
this thing, You must give Me.”

679
00:45:57,542 --> 00:46:00,041
So Shri Rama gave Her some.

680
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:04,166
She said, “Wow, what a thing it is, tremendous.”

681
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:08,458
She ate it and then the Lakshmana says

682
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:10,709
“Give me also, sister-in-law.”

683
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:12,792
She said, “Just now you were saying

684
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:14,917
all kinds of things against this lady.

685
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:16,500
Why do you want to have it?”

686
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:19,625
He said, “Now please forgive me and give me.”

687
00:46:19,834 --> 00:46:22,834
So, see, it shows

688
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
that Shri Rama could see her love,

689
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:30,208
her vibrations in those fruits

690
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:32,291
that she had offered.

691
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,667
And He could appreciate

692
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:38,166
to that extent that He gave it to His wife

693
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:41,625
and the wife also joined hands with Him.

694
00:46:41,834 --> 00:46:43,166
This is what it is.

695
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:46,750
That whatever you do, you do it with love.

696
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:48,750
If you do it with love,

697
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:52,792
you will be able to make it auspicious.

698
00:46:52,999 --> 00:46:58,208
But if there’s no love, you are just doing for some purpose,

699
00:46:58,417 --> 00:47:00,333
then it is useless.

700
00:47:00,542 --> 00:47:06,333
So this is what is there for giving; giving to the

701
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,667
person like Shri Ram,

702
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:16,834
and to such a great incarnation.

703
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:20,709
She just thought of her love

704
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:22,959
and she gave it to Him.

705
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:26,750
In the same way you have to be very simple,

706
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:32,166
simple-hearted, and then you will know what is the best to be done.

707
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,166
So today is, actually the Diwali is over

708
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:40,750
and I want to wish you again and again a happy Diwali

709
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:43,375
and a very prosperous new year.

710
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:47,792
May God bless you all.

711
00:48:30,834 --> 00:48:33,999
The same Lakshmi becomes Mahalakshmi.

712
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:37,917
That is, when you understand

713
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,375
the value of money

714
00:48:44,834 --> 00:48:47,583
and when you are saturated

715
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:51,166
and you are fed up.

716
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:54,500
From inside you get detached,

717
00:48:54,709 --> 00:49:00,375
then a new form of Lakshmi comes forward,

718
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:03,166
that is Mahalakshmi.

719
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:07,333
That’s the power which takes you higher and higher,

720
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:10,375
which is the spiritual awakening.

721
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:15,083
You have seen in all the countries which are very rich,

722
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:18,083
this desire started

723
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:22,917
that they should seek the truth, they should find out the truth

724
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:25,625
and that’s how you are all here.

725
00:49:25,834 --> 00:49:30,250
That means Mahalakshmi Power started working in you,

726
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:32,959
that you were seeking the truth.

727
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:36,917
And while seeking the truth you came to Sahaja Yoga.

728
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:38,917
So this Mahalakshmi

729
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,875
is very important for you also.

730
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:46,500
And you know Kolhapur, there’s a temple of this Mahalakshmi

731
00:49:46,709 --> 00:49:49,583
which came out of the Mother Earth.

732
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:52,999
But they themselves didn’t know that

733
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:59,625
in that temple why they sang “Jogawa,” which said that

734
00:49:59,834 --> 00:50:02,625
“O Ambe, awaken.”

735
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:04,583
Ambe is the Kundalini.

736
00:50:04,792 --> 00:50:08,834
So why in Mahalakshmi’s temple they sang?

737
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,500
You can understand that, why

738
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:15,250
in that temple they started singing

739
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:19,417
the song of “Jogawa” by which to raise the Kundalini.
