1
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:04,339
It is really gratifying

2
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,339
to come to Melbourne

3
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:10,018
I came here

4
00:03:10,463 --> 00:03:13,941
because somebody who had come to Sydney

5
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:19,171
and said that "Mother, you must come to Melbourne.

6
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,365
We need you."

7
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:26,962
When I came here for some other purpose,

8
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:33,442
I felt vibrations of Melbourne

9
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:36,256
are really very good,

10
00:03:37,974 --> 00:03:40,779
and here it is quite possible

11
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:43,129
that there maybe many seekers.

12
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:50,351
It is really gratifying as I said

13
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:52,045
to be here among you.

14
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:58,183
It's a fact that the time has come

15
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:01,029
for thousands and thousands and thousands

16
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:03,315
and millions of them

17
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:07,442
who are born as seekers on this earth,

18
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,764
have to get their Realisation.

19
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:16,038
They have to know their meaning.

20
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,709
They have to know why

21
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:23,967
why the nature has made them a human being from amoeba.

22
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:27,301
What is the purpose of their life?

23
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:30,934
Unless and until you find the purpose of your life

24
00:04:31,327 --> 00:04:33,327
you are not going to be happy.

25
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:36,169
You are not going to be satisfied.

26
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:38,005
You may try anything else.

27
00:04:38,398 --> 00:04:40,656
You may have one of those ego trips;

28
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:45,529
you may have other trips like seeking money.

29
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:51,367
You may have other things like going to drugs,

30
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:53,849
alcoholism,

31
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:57,262
livercation, all kinds of things.

32
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:01,062
But these things have not given any satisfaction,

33
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:03,224
to anyone.

34
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:08,032
You have to find out that Absolute,

35
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:11,580
without which we are in confusion.

36
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:16,174
That Absolute is within you.

37
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,420
That's why Sahaja Yoga

38
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:23,830
is as spontaneous thing, is a living thing.

39
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:26,996
"Saha" means with, "Ja" means born.

40
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:28,916
It is born with you,

41
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:30,903
as in a seed

42
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:34,579
all the maps of the seed that is going to manifest

43
00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:38,496
are built-in.

44
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:40,654
In the same way within you,

45
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:46,619
your Spirit and your Kundalini

46
00:05:46,777 --> 00:05:51,374
are all already existing there

47
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:54,367
and they are just waiting for a chance

48
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:57,957
to give you your Self-Realisation.

49
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:06,727
Before telling you about the benefits of Self-Realisation,

50
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:11,908
I have to tell you that you must keep your minds open

51
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:16,530
as you would for any science lecture or any other lecture.

52
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:21,786
There's no jugglery

53
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:27,446
or there is no shopping, guru shopping in Sahaja Yoga.

54
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:31,310
It is a happening, it’s an actualisation.

55
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:35,447
It is within you. It’s a living force,

56
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:40,687
like a flower becomes a fruit

57
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:45,059
or an egg becomes a chick,

58
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,958
you get your Realisation and you become a different personality,

59
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:53,701
a new dimension of awareness grows into you

60
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,562
and this new dimension of awareness

61
00:06:57,613 --> 00:06:59,034
is an actualisation,

62
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:02,984
it's not just a mere words

63
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:07,056
or any kind of a brainwashing.

64
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,564
It is an actualisation within you,

65
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:15,140
which happens by which

66
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,640
you start feeling

67
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,140
the collective consciousness.

68
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,680
You are a part and parcel of the whole,

69
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:25,994
so many have said it.

70
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,715
We also believe in it

71
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:31,092
that we are the part and parcel of the whole,

72
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:34,021
but so far in our awareness,

73
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:37,608
in our central nervous system, we have not felt that.

74
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:43,166
So this is actually should happen to you.

75
00:07:47,427 --> 00:07:50,561
In this we have to accept,

76
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:56,364
whatever is nourishing for our growth, after Realisation.

77
00:07:58,018 --> 00:08:00,421
Gradually you started accepting it

78
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:02,921
and I'll tell you why it happens

79
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:07,286
but the thing is in Sydney I found

80
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:10,906
that people are extremely honest about their seeking

81
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:14,322
and they really appreciated my honesty.

82
00:08:18,006 --> 00:08:20,006
This is a process

83
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:22,614
which was built in since long within us.

84
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,210
Here that you see different chakras.

85
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,810
Are placed.

86
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:35,724
Can you see? All right.

87
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,469
These centres are placed within

88
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:42,448
the human beings

89
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:46,447
and they exist as subtle centers

90
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:50,081
in the spinal cord and in the brain.

91
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,309
These are called in Sanskrit language as chakras.

92
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:00,862
These centres exist within us

93
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:04,016
as milestones of our evolution.

94
00:09:04,954 --> 00:09:06,954
For example, the lowest chakra

95
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:09,454
called as the Mooladdhara chakra,

96
00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:11,954
is the center,

97
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:17,982
at that point we were carbon atoms. We were matter.

98
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:24,763
At that point we were innocent. Matter is innocent.

99
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,925
So the first thing that was created within us was innocence.

100
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:33,854
This whole universe was created

101
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:37,376
after innocence was created.

102
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:42,139
This chakra is placed

103
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,373
below the Kundalini, if you see it clearly.

104
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,807
Kundalini is the pure power of desire.

105
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:52,654
Pure power of desire.

106
00:09:53,154 --> 00:09:55,356
Whatever is pure we call it Holy.

107
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:59,944
Is the Holy power of desire,

108
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:03,302
which remains

109
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,189
dormant.

110
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:14,361
This power is the desire

111
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:17,794
to be one with the Spirit.

112
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,577
Without knowing the Spirit, you cannot know God.

113
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:26,685
You are to be input to the mains.

114
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:29,568
You are not yet put to the mains.

115
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:31,776
For example, this instrument that we have made

116
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:35,215
if it is not put to the mains, it has no meaning.

117
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:38,627
So that has to happen.

118
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:41,127
It's like the primule in the seed,

119
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:43,244
a germinating power

120
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:44,812
in the seed,

121
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:48,426
that you have got this power, residual power

122
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:50,238
sleeping

123
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
waiting for a moment

124
00:10:53,183 --> 00:10:54,585
when somebody

125
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:57,598
who is authorised by the Divine

126
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:58,693
and not

127
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,503
by any organization or certificates

128
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,208
that human beings give.

129
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:07,957
But somebody, who himself is a Realised soul,

130
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,293
as an enlightened person

131
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:11,793
and he knows

132
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:15,991
what is this power is,

133
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,845
it waits for such a personality

134
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,239
and then it awakens itself

135
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:26,374
and you get your Self-Realisation.

136
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,159
It has to be spontaneous

137
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:36,471
everything vital in life has to be spontaneous.

138
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:41,684
The breathing that we have

139
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:45,948
is so spontaneously going on

140
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:50,535
that we take it for granted till it stops, or till we feel

141
00:11:52,057 --> 00:11:53,390
that we cannot breathe.

142
00:11:55,496 --> 00:11:57,496
If you have to go and read books,

143
00:11:57,613 --> 00:12:01,220
or putting some efforts to breathe,

144
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,937
then how many of us could

145
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:08,955
even exist for more than

146
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
say five minutes?

147
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:15,743
It is so vital

148
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:18,595
is the culmination of our evolution

149
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:24,635
and as the whole creation was created by the Divine,

150
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,848
as you are also created by the Divine,

151
00:12:29,494 --> 00:12:33,767
this great happening is to be done by the Divine.

152
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:39,552
Now some people asked me

153
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,772
that can it not happen by itself to us.

154
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,537
We do not know that at every stage of our evolution

155
00:12:49,443 --> 00:12:52,506
some aspect of God had to incarnate

156
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:56,232
or some guidance had to come from the Divine,

157
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:02,163
to give us a higher awareness.

158
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:05,689
But specially at this time

159
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,419
it is very important

160
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:09,748
that somebody has to do it

161
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,469
because you have reached a stage where,

162
00:13:14,653 --> 00:13:18,323
you have to know it in words,

163
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:21,384
and Divine had to speak.

164
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,795
It's a very common question that in,

165
00:13:28,804 --> 00:13:30,804
I think people are ego orientated,

166
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,913
they said, "Why you Mother?" I said you better be there!

167
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:37,382
I’ll be very happy if you could do it

168
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,519
because I am a happily married woman,

169
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:44,233
I don't need anything from anyone,

170
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:46,733
I have to just give

171
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:52,786
but if you can do my work, I will be very happy to retire.

172
00:13:55,038 --> 00:13:58,083
It's very easy to say, "why you?" I mean you should ask

173
00:13:58,096 --> 00:14:00,610
God why He gave me these powers?

174
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:03,499
But they are there,

175
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:07,670
but one need not feel hurt about it so much also.

176
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:10,621
After all you have some many powers which I don't have.

177
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:13,121
For example, I don't know how to drive,

178
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:14,703
really I don't know.

179
00:14:15,008 --> 00:14:16,209
I don’t know many things,

180
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:18,965
even I don't know how to open ordinary cans

181
00:14:19,587 --> 00:14:22,304
but if I know how to open the Kundalini

182
00:14:23,023 --> 00:14:25,023
why should it hurt your ego?

183
00:14:25,913 --> 00:14:27,913
And why should you feel bad

184
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:30,824
because I have to really work day in day out.

185
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:34,735
To do this work,

186
00:14:35,868 --> 00:14:37,868
it’s something just a gift to you.

187
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:40,149
There is no shopping;

188
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,430
you can't pay for it.

189
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:44,170
It is beyond,

190
00:14:45,157 --> 00:14:47,157
your control.

191
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:52,798
To conceive God, you have to see, as the reality is.

192
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:55,979
You have to give up your conceptions.

193
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:59,158
Supposing I had conceived a hall

194
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:01,658
before seeing this,

195
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,817
I would have had funny ideas

196
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,981
but after seeing it

197
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:08,909
only I really know what it is.

198
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:10,898
In the same way

199
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:12,702
people have written books,

200
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,372
thousands of books they have written

201
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:18,502
or even millions of books they have written, so what to do?

202
00:15:19,562 --> 00:15:20,883
If they have written the books,

203
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:23,648
have they given you any Self-Realisation?

204
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,784
Have they given you that experience

205
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:31,829
of the absolute by which you know yourself,

206
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:35,324
you know your centres and you know the centre of others

207
00:15:35,824 --> 00:15:38,556
and you start manifesting your own powers.

208
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:42,250
You become the master of your powers.

209
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:49,449
This is what should be the criteria of your seeking.

210
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:55,164
Why should you be identified with anything else but yourself?

211
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:57,972
Because I get people

212
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:00,279
belonging to this cult or this group

213
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:02,341
or this religion or this and that.

214
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:07,523
But you must understand

215
00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:10,023
that you are not here

216
00:16:10,255 --> 00:16:12,255
to be pleader for any one of them.

217
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:15,441
I mean you pay them to be their pleader

218
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:20,750
or to be their lawyers or solicitors, whatever you may call it.

219
00:16:23,342 --> 00:16:26,781
But you should really try to honestly seek the truth

220
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:28,992
and ask for this truth

221
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,367
and then only you will get the truth.

222
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,059
So first thing one should understand

223
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,291
that you cannot purchase Divine.

224
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,397
You cannot pay for it, it is an insult,

225
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,135
it is an insult.

226
00:16:45,216 --> 00:16:48,387
And secondly you cannot put in effort for that.

227
00:16:49,228 --> 00:16:50,691
When you have to sprout a seed

228
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:52,704
what do you do? You put it in the Mother Earth,

229
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:55,720
and she sprouts by itself spontaneously.

230
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:57,937
It has got that force in it,

231
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:00,198
only you have to put it to the Mother Earth.

232
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:03,749
And the Mother Earth by her warmth

233
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:06,249
germinates the seed.

234
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,579
Do you get angry with the Mother Earth for that,

235
00:17:09,617 --> 00:17:11,224
that, why must you do that?

236
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:15,696
If she has to do it, she has to do it.

237
00:17:16,196 --> 00:17:18,416
Whatever the sun has to do has to do,

238
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,916
and whatever you have to do, you can do

239
00:17:21,246 --> 00:17:23,246
and whatever the animals have to do, they do.

240
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:28,015
If we understand that

241
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:30,621
we have not yet achieved what we wanted to,

242
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:36,308
then you will realise

243
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
that there is a very little gap.

244
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,792
The Kundalini awakening takes

245
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:45,320
split of a second,

246
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:51,806
but its rising may take more time in certain people

247
00:17:52,914 --> 00:17:57,470
because of blockages in the centre

248
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:01,771
or maybe some imbalances within us.

249
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:06,642
In short I will try to tell you

250
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,625
what is the Kundalini and what is this picture about.

251
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,341
I hope you have got some books with you,

252
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,885
you can also open and see for yourself.

253
00:18:16,385 --> 00:18:19,901
Those who haven't got books can also get from them,

254
00:18:21,106 --> 00:18:24,520
it will be easier to understand it.

255
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:30,576
At the back of the book you will find a nice chart.

256
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:45,188
Firstly you have to be honest about your seeking,

257
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:49,610
absolutely honest about it then everything will work out.

258
00:18:53,005 --> 00:18:56,403
Now here you see this chart

259
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,903
is the first center

260
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:01,548
called as the Mooladhara chakra, as I said,

261
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,030
and the sacrum.

262
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:07,186
See the meaning of the word sacrum means sacred.

263
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,563
Sacrum is the bone in which the Kundalini is there.

264
00:19:14,204 --> 00:19:16,621
I would like you to see from the top

265
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:21,851
this blue color balloon like structure

266
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:24,205
comes down up to the first chakra.

267
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:30,067
Now this,

268
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:39,025
represents a subtle force within us,

269
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:43,565
which is the power of desire.

270
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:47,962
It manifests outside

271
00:19:48,462 --> 00:19:50,462
the left sympathetic nervous system.

272
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:55,351
This is the emotional side of a human being.

273
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:57,180
It is not only emotional.

274
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,662
This is the one that

275
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,162
takes conditionings

276
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:10,750
within itself

277
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:13,834
when we say "Don't do that, don't do that, don't do that"

278
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:21,598
and creates by its activity

279
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:26,446
a balloon like structure called as superego

280
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:28,946
which is in Sanskrit called as mana.

281
00:20:30,614 --> 00:20:35,346
So this is the power of mana, of manashakti.

282
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,440
English language is a little

283
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:39,575
confused, when you say mental cases

284
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,353
you do not mean, the mental cases

285
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:44,936
that has something to do with the

286
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:46,696
mind which thinks.

287
00:20:47,196 --> 00:20:48,810
But when you say mental cases,

288
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:52,399
you mean to say that they are the people who suffer

289
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:54,631
from emotional problems.

290
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,514
It's a little confused thing

291
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:00,233
but in psychology

292
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,613
it is very nicely described by Jung,

293
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:05,404
who was a realised soul himself,

294
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,577
the superego

295
00:21:09,196 --> 00:21:11,541
and the ID part is this

296
00:21:13,428 --> 00:21:15,769
power by which we

297
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:20,311
get all our conditionings within us

298
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:22,665
and we pass it to our past.

299
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:25,656
Beyond this area on the left-hand side

300
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:28,545
lies beyond the subconscious,

301
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:32,424
the collective sub-conscious, all that is dead,

302
00:21:33,386 --> 00:21:36,919
since creation lies this side on the left-hand side.

303
00:21:37,825 --> 00:21:40,125
This manifests as I told you,

304
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,625
the left sympathetic nervous system.

305
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,746
Now in the medical science,

306
00:21:45,246 --> 00:21:48,439
there is no difference between the left and right.

307
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:50,492
But you will find out

308
00:21:50,586 --> 00:21:54,091
they have entirely two different functions.

309
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:57,882
The left sympathetic nervous caters

310
00:21:58,147 --> 00:22:02,378
to our emotional side which can be proved in Sahaja Yoga practice.

311
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,505
Now on the right hand side,

312
00:22:08,603 --> 00:22:10,064
there is another power

313
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:12,692
which is the power of action.

314
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,999
When we desire, the desire has to be put into action.

315
00:22:19,225 --> 00:22:21,944
And this power of desire

316
00:22:23,213 --> 00:22:25,572
is called the prana Shakti,

317
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:28,653
or the power of action

318
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,580
the kriya Shakti, some people call it

319
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,208
and it looks after

320
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:36,708
our intellectual side,

321
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,208
our intelligence

322
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:42,874
and the mind with which we think about the mental side

323
00:22:43,972 --> 00:22:45,972
and our physical side,

324
00:22:46,472 --> 00:22:48,472
through which we go into action.

325
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:57,597
This as a result of it’s activity creates

326
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,755
another balloon you can see there,

327
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:01,310
a yellow color balloon

328
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,343
which we call as ego.

329
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,843
EGO, ego.

330
00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:12,480
And this two powers meet at a point,

331
00:23:13,215 --> 00:23:15,215
when a child is about say

332
00:23:15,715 --> 00:23:18,755
12 years of age, he is completely

333
00:23:19,255 --> 00:23:20,513
calcified here.

334
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:22,649
But in childhood only you see at

335
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,108
the age of say one year or one and the half year,

336
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:27,863
you start feeling the calcification,

337
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:30,693
of this soft bone called as fontanel bone.

338
00:23:32,197 --> 00:23:35,278
In the center is the third power,

339
00:23:39,603 --> 00:23:44,440
called as the power of evolution.

340
00:23:46,072 --> 00:23:49,055
The power of sustenance.

341
00:23:50,431 --> 00:23:52,624
The power of religion

342
00:23:52,825 --> 00:23:54,269
which is innate within us.

343
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:56,769
Now "religo" means a

344
00:23:58,743 --> 00:24:00,743
capacity, you can say a quality

345
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,148
like

346
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:06,929
gold is untarnishable,

347
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:08,623
that is the quality of gold.

348
00:24:08,888 --> 00:24:10,888
Carbon has four valencies

349
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:12,527
that is the quality of carbon.

350
00:24:13,027 --> 00:24:14,132
In the same way,

351
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:17,348
human beings also have got ten sustenance

352
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:20,537
and these ten sustenance are

353
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:21,942
the dharma

354
00:24:22,677 --> 00:24:24,828
or the religions of a human being.

355
00:24:25,328 --> 00:24:28,470
It has nothing to do with outside religions, whatever you believe into

356
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:31,355
or whatever you have fallen into or you are born into.

357
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,417
But there are ten sustanances within us,

358
00:24:35,131 --> 00:24:37,259
which are in this area,

359
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,165
call as, we call it as Void, but it's not the same void as Zen says,

360
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:45,947
but is the visceral cavity

361
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:48,749
in this area,

362
00:24:50,852 --> 00:24:54,162
we develop our sustenance.

363
00:24:57,055 --> 00:25:00,476
By developing our sustanance only we evolve.

364
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:02,956
For example, first a fish

365
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:06,913
came out of the water

366
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:12,362
and developed a sustenance by it started crawling

367
00:25:12,413 --> 00:25:14,413
and it became a reptile.

368
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,507
Firstly only one fish came

369
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,408
and then

370
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:22,885
shoals and shoals of fishes started

371
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,576
coming out of the water.

372
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:27,044
So

373
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:32,889
the evolution went on like this till we became human beings.

374
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:34,982
In this process,

375
00:25:35,803 --> 00:25:37,204
as you know very well

376
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:41,249
the left sided and the right sided animals,

377
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,445
the right sided are the more ambitious, the dominating type.

378
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:46,539
The left sided are the sly.

379
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:49,039
As you have many nocturnal animals

380
00:25:49,454 --> 00:25:50,390
they are all left sided,

381
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,830
they're frightened and live in the left

382
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:57,013
and those who are aggressive are on the right hand side.

383
00:25:58,154 --> 00:26:01,313
They were discarded even some vegetables and what you

384
00:26:01,364 --> 00:26:05,652
call the plants were discarded in the process of evolution.

385
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:09,176
And they were thrown on the right and left side.

386
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:15,573
And God created man in His own image.

387
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,900
That means

388
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:21,407
man has

389
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,357
everything that God has.

390
00:26:25,857 --> 00:26:27,857
If He is the primordial being,

391
00:26:27,951 --> 00:26:30,886
He is the macrocosm then you are the microcosm,

392
00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:33,471
you are a cell in His body

393
00:26:35,103 --> 00:26:37,103
but you are not aware of that.

394
00:26:37,603 --> 00:26:40,562
There's a difference between awareness

395
00:26:41,062 --> 00:26:43,062
and just consciousness.

396
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,037
Awareness is an actualization,

397
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:48,977
while just to be conscious

398
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:52,371
means mentally you believe, rationally you are a conscious, I know that,

399
00:26:53,192 --> 00:26:55,213
we think we are brothers and sisters.

400
00:26:58,662 --> 00:27:00,662
Now the centres that are

401
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,875
placed within. The first one, as I told you,

402
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,374
is the Mooladhara chakra.

403
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,607
You will be happy to know that

404
00:27:13,107 --> 00:27:16,079
in the universe Australia is the Mooladhara chakra.

405
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:25,099
It's a fact you will know that

406
00:27:26,005 --> 00:27:28,925
on vibrations if you ask a question you will know.

407
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:31,257
Basically you are innocent people.

408
00:27:36,415 --> 00:27:39,409
You don't know also when you commit sins that this is sin,

409
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:41,482
you just do it very innocently.

410
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:45,991
You don't do it knowingly, innocently you do it.

411
00:27:49,312 --> 00:27:52,979
And the center second center,

412
00:27:53,768 --> 00:27:56,486
is the center called as Swadisthana chakra.

413
00:27:58,448 --> 00:28:01,521
The first center manifests your pelvic plexus.

414
00:28:07,884 --> 00:28:11,750
The right side, as I told you manifests the right sympathetic nervous system.

415
00:28:13,551 --> 00:28:15,907
The centre one manifests your

416
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,511
parasympathetic which is broken, which is not yet complete.

417
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:22,905
Whatever you have achieved

418
00:28:22,939 --> 00:28:25,247
in your awareness as a human being

419
00:28:25,394 --> 00:28:27,394
is there and there is little gap,

420
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,267
where you have to just

421
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:34,130
break through into that, and become

422
00:28:34,485 --> 00:28:36,992
united with that force.

423
00:28:40,383 --> 00:28:42,889
Now this second chakra

424
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,995
is the chakra called as Swadisthana chakra,

425
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:48,576
you need not worry about the names,

426
00:28:49,076 --> 00:28:52,270
but is the centre for action,

427
00:28:53,252 --> 00:28:56,520
by which you think, think for the future.

428
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,009
And this center looks after

429
00:29:00,911 --> 00:29:01,888
many other

430
00:29:05,231 --> 00:29:07,377
visras or you can say organs within us.

431
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,037
It looks after your liver.

432
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:14,140
All attention is looked after by this centre.

433
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,910
Liver, then it looks after

434
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,928
your pancreas, your spleen,

435
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:22,385
your kidneys

436
00:29:23,688 --> 00:29:26,207
and uterus in the women.

437
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:31,117
The most important function of

438
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:34,059
this centre is to manifest the aortic plexus,

439
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:39,318
in the gross and to convert

440
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:42,493
the fat cells of the stomach

441
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:46,042
to replace the fat cells of the brain

442
00:29:47,602 --> 00:29:49,602
because after all the fat cells

443
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:55,124
of the brain are to be replaced because you think, think, think, think

444
00:29:55,158 --> 00:29:56,636
and go mad with thinking.

445
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:58,733
You think so much

446
00:29:59,121 --> 00:30:00,929
that as if two horns

447
00:30:01,027 --> 00:30:02,481
are coming out of your thinking.

448
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,324
You may say the other day that "Mother,

449
00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:10,357
mind is very important because

450
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:12,127
mind is the problem."

451
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,341
Don't you know that this mind is limited?

452
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:19,698
This rationality is limited.

453
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:22,229
You have to go to unlimited.

454
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:25,257
When I have to come to this hall,

455
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:26,898
we had to leave the car outside.

456
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:31,208
This mind can go up to a point and if you

457
00:30:31,258 --> 00:30:32,712
try to go beyond that,

458
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:34,955
then you really go crazy.

459
00:30:36,563 --> 00:30:38,563
We don't bring the cars inside,

460
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
in the same way this mind

461
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,817
cannot take you to the unlimited.

462
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:48,924
It’s a limited thing, you have to go beyond the mind.

463
00:30:53,761 --> 00:30:57,073
This centre is doing this work

464
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,072
of supplying the fat cells and when you think too much,

465
00:31:01,668 --> 00:31:05,816
all other visaras or all other organs are

466
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:10,828
not looked after, are neglected by which

467
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:17,026
the person who thinks too much

468
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:20,449
who lives in the future, who plans too much,

469
00:31:22,025 --> 00:31:25,782
also then drinks, in addition to that, supposing,

470
00:31:26,796 --> 00:31:28,363
and in addition to that

471
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:30,880
he does other things like

472
00:31:30,914 --> 00:31:33,605
drug taking in the stomach and eats lots of fat food

473
00:31:33,623 --> 00:31:36,615
and all that, so he really finishes that poor liver.

474
00:31:38,978 --> 00:31:41,800
And that liver is the one that sorts out

475
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,285
all your poisons in the body, all kinds of poison.

476
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:50,532
But this liver gets out of order

477
00:31:50,903 --> 00:31:53,924
and you don't feel it, only the heat starts accumulating,

478
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:56,600
you feel always nauseating

479
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,967
and you feel so unhappy, you don't want to face the present,

480
00:32:00,162 --> 00:32:01,321
you want to run away.

481
00:32:01,532 --> 00:32:03,532
You feel extremely horrid

482
00:32:03,871 --> 00:32:05,871
you don't know what to do with yourself.

483
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:07,937
All that comes from a bad liver.

484
00:32:10,975 --> 00:32:13,521
Also apart from liver

485
00:32:14,471 --> 00:32:15,209
your

486
00:32:17,444 --> 00:32:18,767
pancreas goes

487
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:22,141
out and you develop a disease called diabetes.

488
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:26,741
With that you also try some coffee and all those things,

489
00:32:27,434 --> 00:32:28,108
which add up.

490
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:30,608
I mean coffee, the amount of coffee

491
00:32:30,638 --> 00:32:33,108
people consumes, sometimes I can't understand.

492
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:38,370
And that coffee can really spoil the pancreas

493
00:32:38,528 --> 00:32:39,502
to such an extent

494
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:41,786
that you can develop

495
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:44,966
even more serious diseases

496
00:32:45,155 --> 00:32:47,155
than diabetes of the pancreas.

497
00:32:47,655 --> 00:32:50,877
Beyond the pancreas lies the spleen.

498
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:55,690
Spleen is the real victim of modern people,

499
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,870
real victim is poor spleen.

500
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,541
Spleen is the one which is the speedometer within us,

501
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,041
it regulates your speed.

502
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,607
When you are eating your food,

503
00:33:11,495 --> 00:33:13,169
you suddenly open the news

504
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:16,265
on the TV or something, horrible things happen.

505
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:19,342
You get so shocked and emergencies built-in,

506
00:33:19,842 --> 00:33:23,041
the spleen is already the busy producing RBC’s,

507
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:26,523
red corpuscles for the digestion of the food,

508
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:29,994
and suddenly it has another emergency, and

509
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:32,513
a third emergency. The way we take our breakfast,

510
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:36,107
half sandwich in the mouth and half

511
00:33:37,338 --> 00:33:38,334
outside

512
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:42,351
stepping into the car, telling your wife that do this, do that

513
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:46,305
and then rush through the rat race,

514
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:48,337
ending up yourself

515
00:33:48,837 --> 00:33:52,767
into a very crazy spleen.

516
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:54,594
The spleen does not know

517
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:58,581
how to carry on with your telescopic behavior

518
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:01,501
and it go so very crazy

519
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:05,343
that it starts producing crazy cells

520
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,843
and these are the crazy cells

521
00:34:08,343 --> 00:34:10,218
which create ultimately

522
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:13,095
a very serious disease called blood cancer.

523
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:17,325
The other day somebody asked me a question,

524
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:20,011
"Mother, how the children get blood cancer?"

525
00:34:21,088 --> 00:34:23,694
I said if I tell you you shouldn’t be angry with me,

526
00:34:24,194 --> 00:34:27,007
but when we are after the life of our children,

527
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,778
poor things, they are small children.

528
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:31,796
We are trying to make them good citizens.

529
00:34:57,189 --> 00:35:00,481
So this crazy spleen, becomes

530
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,199
absolutely uncontrollable

531
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:08,107
it start producing blood cells

532
00:35:08,457 --> 00:35:12,104
which become malignant. They go at random,

533
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,629
any time and the malignancy starts

534
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,958
where one cell becomes very big,

535
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:21,307
unique as we are also malignant people sometimes.

536
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:23,876
You want to be unique people in the society,

537
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,642
engulfing everybody, encroaching on other people,

538
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,805
in this competition we want to have everything to ourselves,

539
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,678
and by the time

540
00:35:33,054 --> 00:35:35,816
you are old, you find your hands are shaking,

541
00:35:35,848 --> 00:35:38,316
feet are shaking, you can't walk properly

542
00:35:38,602 --> 00:35:41,100
or you develop diseases like say,

543
00:35:41,899 --> 00:35:43,899
heart attack, or a stroke.

544
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:50,108
This rat race is

545
00:35:51,014 --> 00:35:53,819
very competitive. Competition for what?

546
00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:58,290
Everybody should be able to grow

547
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:01,089
in relation to others.

548
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:04,745
For example, if your nose only starts growing like that,

549
00:36:05,608 --> 00:36:07,886
not in relation to your body or face,

550
00:36:07,895 --> 00:36:09,895
what is going to happen to the rest of it?

551
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,642
To be on your own, I’m on my own,

552
00:36:17,364 --> 00:36:19,364
and then you start growing

553
00:36:19,693 --> 00:36:22,844
without any relationship or co-ordination with the other

554
00:36:22,874 --> 00:36:24,511
parts of the society,

555
00:36:25,011 --> 00:36:26,773
other parts of the world,

556
00:36:28,064 --> 00:36:29,462
then you become malignant.

557
00:36:30,817 --> 00:36:34,424
You lose all balance, you don't know what you are doing.

558
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:40,578
This is the tragedy

559
00:36:41,078 --> 00:36:43,419
that when this happens to us

560
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:45,550
we are so ego-orientated

561
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,811
that the pangs are not felt

562
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,653
till you reach a stage, that suddenly you find

563
00:36:50,811 --> 00:36:54,068
a person goes they you call it in English - "ga-ga",

564
00:36:54,568 --> 00:36:56,568
American English.

565
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:02,034
You find them, they can't talk, I have seen it

566
00:37:03,111 --> 00:37:05,111
in Paris. Some people,

567
00:37:05,248 --> 00:37:07,248
not very old, younger to me in age,

568
00:37:07,748 --> 00:37:09,748
walk into a bus

569
00:37:09,885 --> 00:37:11,419
and they are talking loudly,

570
00:37:11,705 --> 00:37:13,705
all sorts of French words

571
00:37:14,205 --> 00:37:16,205
and I asked what are they doing?

572
00:37:16,705 --> 00:37:19,784
They said, "Mother they are talking about last war. I said why?

573
00:37:20,284 --> 00:37:22,693
They said they just go on talking like this, they're gone.

574
00:37:23,193 --> 00:37:26,592
They are, what did you say, out of the deck.

575
00:37:30,853 --> 00:37:34,515
Because you are having such a running jump towards the hell,

576
00:37:36,147 --> 00:37:39,069
that the progress, so called,

577
00:37:40,457 --> 00:37:45,043
will make our society into very funny people

578
00:37:45,434 --> 00:37:47,543
who are jittery,

579
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:51,715
who are twitching their heads, necks and everything

580
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:56,384
and their children are so aggressive,

581
00:37:57,917 --> 00:38:02,298
that it is impossible to understand why they're behaving like this.

582
00:38:08,106 --> 00:38:09,438
We have to understand

583
00:38:09,938 --> 00:38:12,661
that we are part and parcel of the whole.

584
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:16,447
And anything that is done

585
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,947
without the relationship of other

586
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:21,208
can create

587
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:27,402
tremendous problems for the whole world as it is and it is creating.

588
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:34,240
The second centre is very important

589
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:36,269
for modern people as I told you,

590
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,995
because when you start thinking too much also,

591
00:38:41,368 --> 00:38:43,368
what you do is use your right side,

592
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:46,502
and the left side gets frozen.

593
00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:48,805
By improving

594
00:38:49,975 --> 00:38:51,975
on your thinking processes,

595
00:38:52,276 --> 00:38:54,277
thinking too much of the future and

596
00:38:54,288 --> 00:38:56,777
planning and of course most of the plans go waste.

597
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,263
Such a lost of energy we waste in thinking

598
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:05,225
that we find that if we had not thought so much,

599
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:07,345
we would not have been that much frustrated.

600
00:39:09,403 --> 00:39:12,495
The planning also to such an extent

601
00:39:12,995 --> 00:39:14,194
doesn't help in any way.

602
00:39:15,093 --> 00:39:17,093
Supposing I have to come to this hall

603
00:39:17,285 --> 00:39:18,685
and I do not know the way.

604
00:39:19,185 --> 00:39:20,750
What planning can I have?

605
00:39:21,268 --> 00:39:23,532
I have just to ask somebody how do you go there

606
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,271
and face as it is.

607
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:29,829
Supposing a seed has to grow into a root -

608
00:39:30,456 --> 00:39:32,456
does it have any planning before hand?

609
00:39:33,047 --> 00:39:36,200
It does not. What it does is that it faces.

610
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,374
It's a little cell, and so wise,

611
00:39:38,657 --> 00:39:41,094
and it knows that there is an obstruction, no use

612
00:39:41,123 --> 00:39:42,995
fighting with this rock,

613
00:39:43,495 --> 00:39:44,805
so it goes around,

614
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,296
all soft places it pierces

615
00:39:48,796 --> 00:39:52,032
and gets itself embedded sensibly and wisely

616
00:39:52,097 --> 00:39:53,491
and uses that rock,

617
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:57,334
uses that rock for the strengthening of the tree.

618
00:39:59,537 --> 00:40:02,263
So when we try to dominate others,

619
00:40:02,763 --> 00:40:07,018
I mean the sophisticated, the more sophisticated you get,

620
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:11,227
the more sophisticated this ego gets

621
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:16,148
and with that sophistication you are very pleased, sorry,

622
00:40:16,702 --> 00:40:19,686
yes and all those things are there,

623
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,879
but inside a big Mr. ego is developing,

624
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:26,565
like a balloon. And it presses down

625
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:29,100
your superego,

626
00:40:31,393 --> 00:40:33,015
and it comes down.

627
00:40:33,805 --> 00:40:36,130
Now the gap that is between the two

628
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:38,323
or the place where it should be is not there

629
00:40:39,366 --> 00:40:41,710
and ego presses down the superego,

630
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:45,092
till superego starts seeing

631
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,515
the colossal ego.

632
00:40:49,993 --> 00:40:53,720
And then such a person takes to escapes,

633
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:55,586
it takes to alcohol,

634
00:40:55,742 --> 00:40:57,742
which gives rise to superego

635
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:00,387
or it takes to drugs

636
00:41:01,286 --> 00:41:03,286
and all kinds of escapes in life

637
00:41:03,768 --> 00:41:06,683
to run away from his own ego because he can't bear it.

638
00:41:08,813 --> 00:41:11,083
Now the wobbling starts,

639
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:14,108
the ego and superego starts wobbling

640
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:19,017
and that's how you get people who are absolutely confused.

641
00:41:22,198 --> 00:41:24,927
Moreover, to add up to the whole problem

642
00:41:27,673 --> 00:41:30,231
the modern times are the ones

643
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:33,418
that in this confusion,

644
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,865
last judgment has already started.

645
00:41:39,307 --> 00:41:41,541
Through your Kundalini awakening only

646
00:41:41,697 --> 00:41:43,697
you will judge yourself

647
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:45,439
and correct yourself

648
00:41:46,374 --> 00:41:48,717
and you will enter into the kingdom of God.

649
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:53,625
These confusions

650
00:41:55,502 --> 00:42:00,010
actually have led human beings to such frantic

651
00:42:00,564 --> 00:42:02,564
precarious ages

652
00:42:03,064 --> 00:42:05,064
that Sahaja Yoga

653
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,123
had to come on this earth,

654
00:42:08,348 --> 00:42:11,415
to solve the problems once for all.

655
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,728
After getting Realisation,

656
00:42:14,775 --> 00:42:17,280
it's so remarkable when you find your absolute

657
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:19,345
through Kundalini awakening

658
00:42:19,845 --> 00:42:22,974
I have seen people overnight they give up so many things.

659
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,474
Like I know of an old man,

660
00:42:27,061 --> 00:42:29,205
very old man, in Singapore

661
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,470
who is very well known, very rich man

662
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:33,535
and a very well known personality,

663
00:42:36,046 --> 00:42:38,486
and he got his Realisation

664
00:42:38,587 --> 00:42:41,044
and he told me that overnight,

665
00:42:41,164 --> 00:42:42,855
"I gave up my gambling,

666
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:44,824
I gave up my drinking

667
00:42:45,197 --> 00:42:47,709
and I gave up my racing".

668
00:42:49,713 --> 00:42:51,713
These are also escapes in life,

669
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:53,959
these are all escapes

670
00:42:55,057 --> 00:42:57,057
because we are so bored of ourselves.

671
00:42:57,122 --> 00:42:58,848
Imagine a person is imprisoned.

672
00:43:00,492 --> 00:43:02,767
If he is just imprisoned in a nice place,

673
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:05,144
he should not feel upset. After all

674
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:06,893
it's a very good thing to face yourself,

675
00:43:06,904 --> 00:43:08,904
that's the most beautiful thing we have.

676
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:13,395
But because we are so frightened of ourselves only,

677
00:43:13,895 --> 00:43:16,712
that we don't want to be left alone, we think that we are lonely.

678
00:43:18,444 --> 00:43:20,444
We want to run away from ourselves.

679
00:43:21,343 --> 00:43:22,724
We want to have somebody else is

680
00:43:22,753 --> 00:43:25,652
better to have somebody else, and even when somebody else comes in,

681
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:27,772
we do not want to face him squarely

682
00:43:28,544 --> 00:43:30,544
but we want to have something in between,

683
00:43:30,645 --> 00:43:32,645
like a bottle of beer or something.

684
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:39,047
After Realisation you first time start enjoying each other.

685
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,122
You first time start feeling the vibrations on another person

686
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:46,840
and you really enjoy the beauty of another person's

687
00:43:47,177 --> 00:43:49,377
through this cool breeze that is coming

688
00:43:49,497 --> 00:43:51,497
out of the being of that person.

689
00:43:53,338 --> 00:43:55,338
And this should happen to all of you.

690
00:43:56,109 --> 00:43:58,109
You all should achieve it,

691
00:43:58,537 --> 00:44:01,692
it's very important because you are out and out seekers.

692
00:44:02,065 --> 00:44:04,138
But first you must have your self-estimation.

693
00:44:04,837 --> 00:44:07,181
You must know that you are not here to play

694
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:09,681
these games with yourself.

695
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:12,181
All kinds of games are available.

696
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:13,956
The industries have provided,

697
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,220
the Industrial Revolution has provided,

698
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,870
all modern thinkers and the books and all that have got it

699
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:23,747
and to add it gurus have come from India to supply

700
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:26,211
this demand market.

701
00:44:27,309 --> 00:44:28,989
So the picture is complete.

702
00:44:30,177 --> 00:44:33,511
This should not upset,

703
00:44:34,953 --> 00:44:39,603
because behind all fakeness and falsehood there has to be the reality.

704
00:44:40,701 --> 00:44:42,989
If you see thousands of

705
00:44:43,489 --> 00:44:47,296
artificial flowers you must know there has to be one real rose.

706
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,712
And in the same way behind all this falsehood

707
00:44:54,516 --> 00:44:57,764
and confusion there is reality

708
00:44:57,938 --> 00:44:59,938
which is so beautiful within yourself

709
00:45:00,637 --> 00:45:03,098
which you have to achieve through Kundalini awakening.

710
00:45:03,815 --> 00:45:06,641
In short now I will tell you about the other centres

711
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,960
because if you go through this book

712
00:45:09,605 --> 00:45:10,504
you will know

713
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,456
about the names and things but in short I can tell you.

714
00:45:14,065 --> 00:45:15,367
That the third centre

715
00:45:15,523 --> 00:45:17,161
is the centre of our seeking

716
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:20,997
is the center by which we are seeking,

717
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,351
is the navel centre is

718
00:45:23,997 --> 00:45:27,225
by which amoeba, an amoeba felt hungry,

719
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:31,043
he was seeking food. In seeking food only

720
00:45:31,543 --> 00:45:33,817
we went up to the stage of

721
00:45:34,554 --> 00:45:37,104
say mammoth and all these big animals.

722
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:39,221
But they were such unwieldly big things

723
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:41,867
that they could not maintain themselves.

724
00:45:42,221 --> 00:45:44,492
So then the intelligent animals came in.

725
00:45:44,773 --> 00:45:45,861
In that also

726
00:45:46,051 --> 00:45:48,051
some of them were very horrid ones

727
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:49,731
like foxes and all that.

728
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:53,712
Then very powerful animals came up

729
00:45:53,848 --> 00:45:55,848
who had more physical power

730
00:45:56,057 --> 00:45:58,057
than their big body.

731
00:45:58,247 --> 00:46:00,247
Like that we develop

732
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:03,678
with this seeking up to a point when we became really human beings

733
00:46:04,324 --> 00:46:06,563
and when we became human beings

734
00:46:06,717 --> 00:46:10,440
we started seeking things like possessions;

735
00:46:11,141 --> 00:46:14,191
if not possession, like power,

736
00:46:14,545 --> 00:46:20,554
in politics, economics, social work, social things

737
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,236
and lastly, the Spirit.

738
00:46:24,665 --> 00:46:27,501
Spirit is the solution for all of them.

739
00:46:29,822 --> 00:46:33,443
Without the light you cannot see anything in this world.

740
00:46:34,781 --> 00:46:37,647
I cannot see you without any light in there.

741
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:43,671
To me, in darkness you are nothing but darkness. I don't see it.

742
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:46,936
I cannot relate one to another.

743
00:46:47,108 --> 00:46:51,131
I do not know who are sitting here and listening to me,

744
00:46:52,232 --> 00:46:55,681
but once there is light you can see everything clearly,

745
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:57,961
and that's what it is, happens.

746
00:46:58,097 --> 00:47:00,097
That when you get your enlightenment

747
00:47:00,597 --> 00:47:03,268
you become the master of yourself.

748
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:08,238
This is the end of the seeking which starts.

749
00:47:08,738 --> 00:47:11,441
In this seeking only, around the seeking

750
00:47:11,941 --> 00:47:15,512
are our sustenance’s are developed gradually

751
00:47:15,775 --> 00:47:17,902
and ultimately we become human beings.

752
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:20,715
And for human beings there are ten sustenance’s

753
00:47:21,106 --> 00:47:23,106
described in the Ten Commandments.

754
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,260
When I talk about Ten Commandments,

755
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,687
a one gentleman got very angry and said "You are

756
00:47:27,713 --> 00:47:29,713
a Christian, you are a Christian, you are a Christian!"

757
00:47:31,634 --> 00:47:33,634
But Ten Commandments were written

758
00:47:33,861 --> 00:47:36,375
when there were Jews, they were not written,

759
00:47:36,474 --> 00:47:38,745
Moses was not a Christian, he was a Jew

760
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,516
and the Jew got angry with me

761
00:47:40,706 --> 00:47:42,196
that I was a Christian.

762
00:47:43,643 --> 00:47:44,899
Moses, Abraham,

763
00:47:46,638 --> 00:47:48,638
Confucius, Socrates,

764
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:53,679
Mohammed, Nanak, Janak,

765
00:47:54,398 --> 00:47:56,984
Lao Tse, these are the

766
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:00,176
Primordial masters.

767
00:48:01,204 --> 00:48:04,056
The principle of primordial masters, the Adi-Gurus

768
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,122
who incarnated on this earth

769
00:48:06,695 --> 00:48:10,229
to teach us how to keep our sustenance.

770
00:48:11,075 --> 00:48:15,275
They taught against all strong alcohols and strong things.

771
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:17,593
Christ did not talk

772
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,956
but it does not mean that when He said

773
00:48:19,982 --> 00:48:21,982
He converted into wine, means He

774
00:48:22,045 --> 00:48:23,239
fermented the wine.

775
00:48:23,287 --> 00:48:25,739
You cannot ferment the wine in a minute, you understand that.

776
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:30,238
Wine is a very common word, even today if you go

777
00:48:30,738 --> 00:48:33,122
will find that wine means

778
00:48:34,187 --> 00:48:35,854
grapes. I mean even

779
00:48:36,354 --> 00:48:38,354
a creeper of the grape is called a wine,

780
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:40,599
even the juice of he thing is called wine.

781
00:48:40,935 --> 00:48:42,945
Now to differentiate we are starting to call it

782
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:44,971
grape juice. But it is very, very

783
00:48:44,979 --> 00:48:46,403
loose, but you will be surprised it is a very

784
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:49,946
... About fifty years back people must have started or something like that

785
00:48:50,191 --> 00:48:53,145
in India, but may be abroad, I don't know.

786
00:48:53,261 --> 00:48:57,437
Even today many people call it a wine "raksasia",

787
00:48:57,736 --> 00:49:00,592
even in Indian language it is called as the wine.

788
00:49:00,873 --> 00:49:03,409
Any grape juice is called as a wine.

789
00:49:05,134 --> 00:49:07,647
So there are many other things

790
00:49:07,727 --> 00:49:09,310
which these people told us

791
00:49:09,463 --> 00:49:12,297
that you should not do, to keep yourself in the centre.

792
00:49:13,766 --> 00:49:18,071
Now I divide our mistakes into categories.

793
00:49:20,637 --> 00:49:23,779
The first mistake we have is not to believe

794
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,598
that God Almighty

795
00:49:26,098 --> 00:49:28,098
is going to look after our well-being.

796
00:49:29,183 --> 00:49:31,183
Krishna has said very clearly

797
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:33,700
that Yoga kshemam Vahaamyaham. Meaning

798
00:49:33,725 --> 00:49:36,563
after Yoga, after union with God,

799
00:49:37,063 --> 00:49:39,063
I will look after your well being.

800
00:49:41,281 --> 00:49:43,281
That means you should get connected.

801
00:49:43,544 --> 00:49:45,781
Supposing I am not an Australian citizen

802
00:49:45,897 --> 00:49:48,245
why will Australian Government look after me?

803
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,588
In the same way if you are not the members

804
00:49:52,997 --> 00:49:54,570
of God's community

805
00:49:54,834 --> 00:49:57,826
or if you are not entered into the Kingdom of God

806
00:49:58,144 --> 00:50:00,326
or if you are not a citizen of His Kingdom,

807
00:50:01,173 --> 00:50:04,194
it is not His responsibility to look after your well being.

808
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:08,422
I mean of course He has created you, so He looks after you.

809
00:50:09,269 --> 00:50:14,570
But otherwise it's not certain that He'll look after you.

810
00:50:18,196 --> 00:50:21,270
People demand so much from God,

811
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,402
they think they are already connected.

812
00:50:24,085 --> 00:50:27,858
They treat Him as if you can find Him somewhere under the stone.

813
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:31,675
They go on demanding please look after my son,

814
00:50:31,718 --> 00:50:33,718
please do this, praying morning till evening,

815
00:50:34,218 --> 00:50:35,325
I mean it's pestering.

816
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,425
When you are not connected with God,

817
00:50:39,218 --> 00:50:40,493
if you go on

818
00:50:40,993 --> 00:50:43,304
doing like this to any human being also,

819
00:50:43,658 --> 00:50:44,669
you'll get arrested.

820
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:50,705
And that's what happens, that we live under myths:

821
00:50:50,711 --> 00:50:54,248
"Oh I have been praying and God has given me this,

822
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,680
and I have been doing this."

823
00:50:57,778 --> 00:50:59,778
But we don't see, do we deserve it?

824
00:51:01,174 --> 00:51:04,839
Are we the Spirit? Have we tried to be the Spirit?

825
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:08,837
We have done all kinds of things but to be the Spirit.

826
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:12,983
When you are the Spirit then you are really blessed -

827
00:51:13,483 --> 00:51:14,370
really blessed,

828
00:51:15,748 --> 00:51:17,748
not only by His powers

829
00:51:18,047 --> 00:51:20,047
but you become the master of your being,

830
00:51:20,456 --> 00:51:23,340
and you start manifesting your own powers.

831
00:51:26,052 --> 00:51:28,777
This seeking and the surrounding dharma

832
00:51:29,515 --> 00:51:31,715
which is looked after by the Primordial masters

833
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:36,424
is another centre here, above that is the centre

834
00:51:37,143 --> 00:51:39,143
of the Mother of the Universe,

835
00:51:39,204 --> 00:51:40,869
who gives us the security.

836
00:51:43,698 --> 00:51:45,805
This one when spoiled

837
00:51:45,982 --> 00:51:48,305
the security, the sense of security spoiled

838
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:49,844
especially among women,

839
00:51:50,344 --> 00:51:53,522
when they feel that their husband are negligent or they are

840
00:51:54,214 --> 00:51:57,149
flirting with other women and all sorts of things.

841
00:51:57,756 --> 00:51:59,972
Then this centre goes but of order.

842
00:52:01,006 --> 00:52:03,006
When this centre goes out of order,

843
00:52:03,506 --> 00:52:07,466
then they develop diseases like breast cancer.

844
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:11,842
Breast cancer

845
00:52:11,872 --> 00:52:15,250
is more common in societies where they have divorces.

846
00:52:16,605 --> 00:52:18,778
I have given a regular speech on this

847
00:52:18,893 --> 00:52:21,566
which you should get from Sydney and you will know all about it.

848
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:24,814
Now the right side heart which you see here

849
00:52:25,164 --> 00:52:27,164
is the centre of a Father,

850
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:30,076
the left one is the centre of the Mother.

851
00:52:32,777 --> 00:52:36,596
The right side heart centre catches when as a father

852
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,501
you have not done your duties

853
00:52:39,108 --> 00:52:41,448
or if your father has died very early,

854
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:45,134
you were shocked, then also it can happen.

855
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:48,854
Anorexia and all these diseases can also be

856
00:52:49,076 --> 00:52:51,359
caused by this kind of happenings

857
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:53,837
or also asthma.

858
00:52:54,102 --> 00:52:56,726
Asthma is invariably is caused

859
00:52:57,226 --> 00:52:59,226
by this centre going out of order.

860
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:04,102
The left side is the centre of the Mother,

861
00:53:05,029 --> 00:53:07,266
our father and mother we chose.

862
00:53:08,492 --> 00:53:10,492
Before our birth we chose them.

863
00:53:11,056 --> 00:53:13,728
It was foolish to choose horrible parents.

864
00:53:14,378 --> 00:53:15,701
But you better pay for it.

865
00:53:17,718 --> 00:53:19,226
In one lifetime

866
00:53:19,534 --> 00:53:21,858
it is better to pay for the horrible ones

867
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,080
so that next time you won't have them again.

868
00:53:26,973 --> 00:53:29,715
But we are not to judge them.

869
00:53:30,215 --> 00:53:31,948
If they are not seekers

870
00:53:31,999 --> 00:53:34,191
it's a very difficult thing to live with them, I know.

871
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:37,012
It's very difficult to live with parents

872
00:53:37,106 --> 00:53:38,846
who are morning till evening

873
00:53:38,898 --> 00:53:42,409
counting every penny, counting every tin which are emptied,

874
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:46,206
every tube that is emptied, they store up,

875
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:47,953
they are so materialistic

876
00:53:48,453 --> 00:53:51,889
and you just can't bear such people, I can quite understand.

877
00:53:52,389 --> 00:53:55,024
Even a wife could be like that, and a husband could be like that,

878
00:53:55,182 --> 00:53:57,182
extremely materialistic, you will be fed up.

879
00:53:57,682 --> 00:54:01,403
They write down everything, every lamp post they must know,

880
00:54:02,651 --> 00:54:04,908
count everything.

881
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:07,324
Today a lady who interviewed me asked me,

882
00:54:07,503 --> 00:54:10,500
"How many people, Mother, have you given Realisation

883
00:54:10,829 --> 00:54:12,894
and how many people you have cured."

884
00:54:12,988 --> 00:54:15,357
I said "You better ask the sun first of all

885
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:18,233
how many leaves it has made green, then talk to me."

886
00:54:22,066 --> 00:54:23,819
I never write any accounts,

887
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,853
leave alone of human beings, even of money.

888
00:54:27,353 --> 00:54:28,986
I never write, I have no time,

889
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:31,589
I have no understanding as how to write accounts.

890
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:34,727
Next life maybe I will be an accountant, for your information.

891
00:54:38,774 --> 00:54:43,065
So this happens to us when we become

892
00:54:44,591 --> 00:54:47,101
against our parents.

893
00:54:47,601 --> 00:54:50,373
I don't say that you should carry on

894
00:54:50,638 --> 00:54:52,690
with mad people, there's no use

895
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,855
asking the bull to come and hit you, is correct.

896
00:54:56,355 --> 00:54:58,077
But you need not judge them,

897
00:54:58,171 --> 00:54:59,594
you can leave them, stay away

898
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:01,667
and do not have them in your life, it's alright.

899
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,848
But if you are taking

900
00:55:05,113 --> 00:55:08,235
interest in them as well as fighting with them morning till evening,

901
00:55:08,372 --> 00:55:10,051
then you catch on this heart chakra.

902
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:15,405
I would say that in this respect Indians are sensible people.

903
00:55:16,482 --> 00:55:19,958
They are very sensible that they keep their parents all right.

904
00:55:20,565 --> 00:55:22,180
And the parents are also yet

905
00:55:22,324 --> 00:55:24,808
very sensible people. They love their children, they give

906
00:55:24,817 --> 00:55:26,817
everything that they have to the children,

907
00:55:26,954 --> 00:55:32,610
and children start really loving their parents,

908
00:55:32,768 --> 00:55:34,768
till they die they look after them.

909
00:55:36,272 --> 00:55:38,726
The result of that is of course very bad,

910
00:55:39,226 --> 00:55:42,613
because here in all the western countries the parents

911
00:55:42,814 --> 00:55:45,638
are still in a bridal mood, I mean they are brides

912
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:48,330
and the bridegrooms you see

913
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:52,048
they never become old enough to be parents.

914
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,926
Seen even an eighty year old man you will find

915
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,104
marry an eighteen year old girl. I mean

916
00:55:56,155 --> 00:55:58,155
it's a thing going on all the time. God knows

917
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,655
what sort of intelligence is that?

918
00:56:01,347 --> 00:56:03,839
But with all that happening

919
00:56:03,997 --> 00:56:05,997
poor children do not know

920
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:07,944
which parents to be chosen.

921
00:56:08,444 --> 00:56:10,766
And the last judgement has started, now what to do?

922
00:56:11,608 --> 00:56:13,608
Now you place yourself in their places

923
00:56:13,681 --> 00:56:15,013
and think what would you do

924
00:56:15,107 --> 00:56:17,277
when you know such crazy parents that today

925
00:56:17,286 --> 00:56:19,051
they are together, tomorrow they are divorced.

926
00:56:19,551 --> 00:56:21,421
On the streets they will be kissing,

927
00:56:21,686 --> 00:56:22,986
hugging each other,

928
00:56:23,486 --> 00:56:26,798
doing all kind of nonsensical thing. Very embarrassing also,

929
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:29,084
and if you ask them where are you

930
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,135
going they say they are going to the divorce case.

931
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:38,587
These kinds of absurdities are taking place and because of that

932
00:56:39,087 --> 00:56:41,087
children don't want to get birth

933
00:56:42,313 --> 00:56:44,163
in all these places; England,

934
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:46,791
Germany, Switzerland, everywhere.

935
00:56:47,697 --> 00:56:51,780
The birth rate is towards the minus side.

936
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,280
In Germany especially, West Germany

937
00:56:54,566 --> 00:56:56,807
and East Germany of all the things

938
00:56:56,858 --> 00:57:00,046
people give so much money that a woman if she produces

939
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:03,401
three children she earns more money than their Prime Minister.

940
00:57:03,901 --> 00:57:05,901
But still women don't want to produce.

941
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:09,178
They want to be free, independent, they don't want to be mothers.

942
00:57:09,956 --> 00:57:12,279
As a result this poor India

943
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:15,195
has to accommodate for all the children born today

944
00:57:16,635 --> 00:57:19,921
and we are blamed for over population,

945
00:57:20,421 --> 00:57:23,057
now what to do? We have to bear the load.

946
00:57:26,356 --> 00:57:28,961
So also it is your responsibility

947
00:57:29,354 --> 00:57:31,638
to see if you do not produce children

948
00:57:31,689 --> 00:57:33,776
at least those who are producing children

949
00:57:33,977 --> 00:57:37,568
have some compassion for them

950
00:57:37,726 --> 00:57:39,813
and have some understanding.

951
00:57:39,843 --> 00:57:42,315
Do not blame them. Oh everybody tells me,

952
00:57:42,494 --> 00:57:45,141
what about your problem of population.

953
00:57:46,047 --> 00:57:49,634
I tell them now who is responsible for our population

954
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:54,730
because in that country even if you have fourteen children,

955
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:57,230
they love all their children that are there.

956
00:57:58,328 --> 00:58:01,768
They are not so ego-orientated that their hearts are not closed,

957
00:58:02,759 --> 00:58:04,759
they are not so unemotional,

958
00:58:05,537 --> 00:58:09,656
anybody who has no child will go to

959
00:58:09,707 --> 00:58:11,255
all the holy places

960
00:58:11,926 --> 00:58:14,423
and ask for blessings that they should get children,

961
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,561
to get a child

962
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:20,124
is such a blessing in India and child is such an important thing.

963
00:58:22,462 --> 00:58:24,869
But the mistake they are committing

964
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,916
is just the other than yours.

965
00:58:28,715 --> 00:58:31,015
The mistake in those developing countries

966
00:58:31,045 --> 00:58:33,898
is that they do not believe that God Almighty

967
00:58:33,992 --> 00:58:36,777
is the One who is going to look after your well being.

968
00:58:37,491 --> 00:58:39,693
They don't believe in the power of their Father,

969
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,927
so they do the crime against the Father or

970
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:43,386
you can say the sin against the Father.

971
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:46,653
When you don't believe in the capacity of your Father,

972
00:58:48,499 --> 00:58:51,918
so there is bribery, corruption, all sorts of things going on, you know

973
00:58:52,183 --> 00:58:55,280
cutting corners and money and all those things go on.

974
00:58:56,464 --> 00:58:58,205
Still in India I would not say that

975
00:58:59,111 --> 00:59:02,868
ordinary people are dishonest. I mean our bureaucrats may be, our

976
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:06,005
politicians may be and business people may be. But

977
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,120
ordinary people are very honest in India.

978
00:59:10,137 --> 00:59:11,386
But this is what happens.

979
00:59:12,394 --> 00:59:15,027
On the other side, you see supposing

980
00:59:15,527 --> 00:59:17,928
an Indian comes to your house, be careful

981
00:59:18,974 --> 00:59:22,447
he may run away with anything that you have in the house, anything,

982
00:59:22,947 --> 00:59:25,246
see, but

983
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:28,181
if an American comes to your house, be careful about your wife.

984
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:32,402
He may run away with your wife or with your daughter.

985
00:59:33,806 --> 00:59:37,329
Or say an Englishman comes he'll do it in a subtler way

986
00:59:37,829 --> 00:59:38,922
because he's a scholar.

987
00:59:40,232 --> 00:59:42,998
So he reads some poetry to your wife

988
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:45,061
and in the night you find she is missing.

989
00:59:49,327 --> 00:59:52,381
This is fundamental, I mean the wife

990
00:59:52,806 --> 00:59:54,938
who runs away like this creates problem

991
00:59:56,304 --> 00:59:58,304
fundamentally for the household.

992
00:59:58,992 --> 01:00:00,992
Just think in a house,

993
01:00:01,361 --> 01:00:05,328
where there are children, there is husband, kitchen

994
01:00:05,828 --> 01:00:08,610
and all the places, everybody sleeping nicely,

995
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:10,596
early in the morning they find

996
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:13,844
that the main pole of the house is missing and the whole thing is collapsed.

997
01:00:14,589 --> 01:00:17,934
What will happen to the children, nobody thinks.

998
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:20,943
Nobody understands

999
01:00:21,443 --> 01:00:24,046
or they think they are being in love

1000
01:00:24,697 --> 01:00:25,842
so they must go.

1001
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:29,796
Men do the same. I mean there is no difference between men and women.

1002
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:35,329
But this is the sin against the Mother

1003
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:41,792
that the women have to be respectable and respected.

1004
01:00:44,213 --> 01:00:47,704
Housewives’ position is within us

1005
01:00:47,752 --> 01:00:49,752
here on the left hand side, nabhi

1006
01:00:51,005 --> 01:00:52,510
and if a housewife,

1007
01:00:52,671 --> 01:00:54,993
the deity of housewife, is not in our house,

1008
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:57,366
not that the woman but the housewife,

1009
01:00:59,674 --> 01:01:01,674
then our spleen goes out.

1010
01:01:03,568 --> 01:01:06,945
We get, children get crazy,

1011
01:01:07,445 --> 01:01:10,242
why is there in-disciplined. Somebody asked me today

1012
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:14,971
what happens to the people like who try to kill Reagan?

1013
01:01:15,488 --> 01:01:17,488
I said, ask his mother.

1014
01:01:19,382 --> 01:01:22,465
She must be after the life of the child, morning till evening

1015
01:01:22,965 --> 01:01:26,249
and that's why he's taking action,

1016
01:01:26,372 --> 01:01:28,787
or is a reaction of what has happened to him.

1017
01:01:30,003 --> 01:01:33,391
How do these complications arise

1018
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:35,891
has a basis in the family

1019
01:01:36,881 --> 01:01:39,807
in the nest, that is your house.

1020
01:01:41,776 --> 01:01:43,776
You have to live in the nest

1021
01:01:44,766 --> 01:01:46,766
as a father and a mother

1022
01:01:47,266 --> 01:01:48,729
looking after your children.

1023
01:01:49,662 --> 01:01:52,309
Children are the most important things

1024
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:56,160
in the whole world for human beings.

1025
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,070
Let the politics go to hell,

1026
01:02:02,156 --> 01:02:04,667
and let the economics take its own course,

1027
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:06,425
but children

1028
01:02:07,151 --> 01:02:09,957
are to be looked after, that's your primary duty.

1029
01:02:11,719 --> 01:02:13,719
But in India we go to the other end,

1030
01:02:14,012 --> 01:02:16,240
when we start look after our children we don't mind

1031
01:02:16,269 --> 01:02:18,269
selling our countries also in the name of children.

1032
01:02:21,236 --> 01:02:23,236
But we live with two extremes I feel,

1033
01:02:23,265 --> 01:02:24,943
the sin against the Mother

1034
01:02:25,066 --> 01:02:27,066
and the sin against the Father.

1035
01:02:29,543 --> 01:02:31,543
When we sin against the Mother

1036
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:35,313
as Australians, as I am now an Australian,

1037
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,418
let us face what happens to us.

1038
01:02:41,703 --> 01:02:44,877
Absolutely we are emotionally blackmailed by ourselves.

1039
01:02:46,481 --> 01:02:49,606
We torture ourselves, we live with artificial things.

1040
01:02:50,746 --> 01:02:53,651
Like if a wife

1041
01:02:54,151 --> 01:02:56,755
wants to run away with another man

1042
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:01,109
we will even go to get a honeymoon ticket for her

1043
01:03:01,364 --> 01:03:04,321
because we are very considerate good husbands.

1044
01:03:05,857 --> 01:03:08,671
Same thing with the wives if she finds that the husband

1045
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,720
is interested in another woman,

1046
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,787
she should not be jealous.

1047
01:03:13,287 --> 01:03:19,181
In Sahaja Yoga this is not very much appreciated.

1048
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,804
Husband has to behave, like a husband. He should make his wife

1049
01:03:22,871 --> 01:03:23,710
run the house.

1050
01:03:24,361 --> 01:03:26,361
And the woman has to be a woman.

1051
01:03:28,236 --> 01:03:30,236
She must see to it that

1052
01:03:30,585 --> 01:03:32,585
no danger is brought to the children.

1053
01:03:33,593 --> 01:03:36,748
We have no business to hurt anyone like this

1054
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:39,060
and we do not know how much we hurt,

1055
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,560
we give cancers to our wives and husbands.

1056
01:03:42,663 --> 01:03:44,663
We give all kinds of horrible diseases,

1057
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:47,981
mental tortures we make them mad, by our

1058
01:03:48,669 --> 01:03:50,669
mad, capricious,

1059
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:57,013
very shallow, understanding of our emotions.

1060
01:03:59,151 --> 01:04:02,000
A one man starts going to another woman,

1061
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,906
then he goes to another woman,

1062
01:04:04,086 --> 01:04:05,645
then to ten women he goes

1063
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:07,445
and then ten men go to ten women

1064
01:04:07,531 --> 01:04:10,882
and end up in a lunatic asylum or

1065
01:04:11,118 --> 01:04:14,886
in the orphanage. I have seen in England we had a neighbor

1066
01:04:15,047 --> 01:04:18,455
who had a very huge house, he died, he was an old man

1067
01:04:18,597 --> 01:04:19,654
and you'd be surprised

1068
01:04:20,154 --> 01:04:22,895
they did not discover his body for one month.

1069
01:04:23,244 --> 01:04:25,694
Because there's no family feeling, nothing,

1070
01:04:26,665 --> 01:04:29,413
even a rat doesn't enter that house. Can you imagine!

1071
01:04:32,757 --> 01:04:35,002
This is what has happened in thinking,

1072
01:04:35,069 --> 01:04:37,747
“I am separated, I am individualistic.

1073
01:04:37,814 --> 01:04:40,941
I am exclusive”. If you are really individualistic,

1074
01:04:41,385 --> 01:04:43,385
if you are really mature, individually,

1075
01:04:44,337 --> 01:04:47,678
then you know the unity much better.

1076
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:51,610
Then you understand that you are the support

1077
01:04:52,487 --> 01:04:56,970
of the whole because you are so matured.

1078
01:04:58,977 --> 01:05:00,977
No wonder our children are not maturing.

1079
01:05:01,684 --> 01:05:03,684
They are behaving in such a manner.

1080
01:05:04,429 --> 01:05:07,840
We are responsible, we must accept that in our own

1081
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:12,252
ideas about compatibility and all this nonsense,

1082
01:05:12,262 --> 01:05:14,050
we don’t have in India, we are quite comfortable,

1083
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:15,945
we are producing children quite all right.

1084
01:05:17,424 --> 01:05:24,001
We have no problems. Why do you run after these capricious,

1085
01:05:24,783 --> 01:05:26,783
these shallow ideas?

1086
01:05:28,771 --> 01:05:30,771
You will be held responsible

1087
01:05:32,213 --> 01:05:36,200
for all these horrible diseases that men and women have got,

1088
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,700
and the children that are going to suffer,

1089
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,727
if you have charity, better start it at home.

1090
01:05:45,319 --> 01:05:46,786
Better be charitable

1091
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:49,286
to your own wife and to your own husband.

1092
01:05:49,786 --> 01:05:52,265
Be charitable to your children.

1093
01:05:52,351 --> 01:05:54,799
Don't go by concept of falling in love,

1094
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:57,017
you'll fall, really and make others fall too.

1095
01:05:58,515 --> 01:06:01,632
It's a concept, just a concept.

1096
01:06:02,132 --> 01:06:05,574
I think some of these horrible people must have given you this concept.

1097
01:06:06,865 --> 01:06:08,335
If you really fall in love

1098
01:06:08,421 --> 01:06:10,421
how do you get up to marry another person?

1099
01:06:11,486 --> 01:06:13,937
You fall, marry another person,

1100
01:06:14,588 --> 01:06:16,588
again ready to marry another person.

1101
01:06:16,655 --> 01:06:18,225
You are holding the hand of a person

1102
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:20,292
who is suppose to be your beloved or whatever it is,

1103
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:22,318
and looking at another one.

1104
01:06:23,402 --> 01:06:27,127
This concept is absolutely wrong. You have to grow in love.

1105
01:06:29,906 --> 01:06:31,906
As your own child is

1106
01:06:32,011 --> 01:06:35,173
in the same way is your companion. They are two parts

1107
01:06:35,842 --> 01:06:36,980
of one chariot.

1108
01:06:37,612 --> 01:06:40,261
One is the left and other is the right. They're not

1109
01:06:41,269 --> 01:06:43,269
unequal, they're equal

1110
01:06:43,336 --> 01:06:46,551
but they are not similar, they have their own role.

1111
01:06:46,844 --> 01:06:49,379
And women have to take their role courageously,

1112
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:52,986
to be the mother, as I always say, look at me.

1113
01:06:53,787 --> 01:06:57,845
I am a Mother and in no way,

1114
01:06:59,136 --> 01:07:01,136
in any way, I cannot think

1115
01:07:01,467 --> 01:07:03,467
I could be anything better than this.

1116
01:07:06,547 --> 01:07:08,848
Now if I start thinking, Oh God,

1117
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:11,179
I am a Mother all right, but

1118
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:13,679
I must know how to drive,

1119
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:18,002
then I'm finished. I must know how to drive a bus,

1120
01:07:18,709 --> 01:07:20,709
I must know how to drive a train!

1121
01:07:21,247 --> 01:07:22,361
What is the need?

1122
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:25,937
I saw one photographer who came to see me.

1123
01:07:26,098 --> 01:07:27,671
He was supposed to take my photograph

1124
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:29,719
and whole hands were fill with blisters.

1125
01:07:30,219 --> 01:07:32,260
I said first let me cure your blisters.

1126
01:07:32,289 --> 01:07:33,796
How you are going to take my photograph?

1127
01:07:34,127 --> 01:07:36,999
I said what have you been doing with your, photography?

1128
01:07:37,066 --> 01:07:39,773
No, he said, this, I went to a forest

1129
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,972
and I cut some trees. I said, for what?

1130
01:07:42,321 --> 01:07:45,425
You are a photographer, your hands are soft and deft

1131
01:07:45,869 --> 01:07:48,131
why do you want to kill the deftness of your fingers?

1132
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:51,561
He said, no we must do other things also. I said, why must you?

1133
01:07:53,172 --> 01:07:55,191
You see the nose doesn’t do the work of the eyes

1134
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:57,239
and the eyes do not do the work of the ears.

1135
01:07:57,739 --> 01:08:01,069
Why must you do, your hands are all finished! And this is what it is.

1136
01:08:02,887 --> 01:08:05,386
To us we feel that men are great

1137
01:08:05,491 --> 01:08:08,340
so we start saying, "let's do the man's work."

1138
01:08:10,723 --> 01:08:13,253
The man thinks, why "should women be like this?"

1139
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,553
You are companions -

1140
01:08:15,222 --> 01:08:18,715
you are eternal companions. You are two

1141
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:23,249
beautiful wheels of a chariot.

1142
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,540
This is to be grown

1143
01:08:26,758 --> 01:08:28,251
and to be matured within you.

1144
01:08:28,469 --> 01:08:30,201
And when this centre is out,

1145
01:08:30,475 --> 01:08:33,624
you get the problems of this centre

1146
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,415
by which you get asthma, tuberculosis,

1147
01:08:37,932 --> 01:08:39,932
and the breast troubles.

1148
01:08:39,961 --> 01:08:43,567
Men get asthma, very serious asthma and

1149
01:08:43,596 --> 01:08:45,273
other problems of the lungs

1150
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:48,854
and ultimately, also lung cancer can develop.

1151
01:08:51,087 --> 01:08:53,426
When you work too hard with the right hand side,

1152
01:08:53,474 --> 01:08:56,745
you are ego orientated, that is ego develops too much,

1153
01:08:56,812 --> 01:08:58,812
then your left side is neglected,

1154
01:08:58,841 --> 01:09:01,625
you become unemotional, that time

1155
01:09:01,748 --> 01:09:03,748
your heart gives a signal, you get a heart attack.

1156
01:09:05,321 --> 01:09:07,321
When you do too much sometimes

1157
01:09:07,783 --> 01:09:10,185
you may escape the heart attack, but you may get

1158
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:11,586
a  brain paralysis.

1159
01:09:15,513 --> 01:09:18,454
We are bent upon destroying ourselves.

1160
01:09:18,577 --> 01:09:22,090
The destruction is going to come from within, not from without.

1161
01:09:23,739 --> 01:09:26,872
Those people who are try to shock you, this will happen,

1162
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,507
that the sun is doing this, this is nothing.

1163
01:09:29,856 --> 01:09:32,523
It's all within you, the destruction has started.

1164
01:09:33,023 --> 01:09:36,315
You are facing it because

1165
01:09:36,815 --> 01:09:40,177
you cannot accept it.

1166
01:09:41,449 --> 01:09:42,768
You have to accept

1167
01:09:44,021 --> 01:09:46,047
that this is a challenge, I am not

1168
01:09:46,076 --> 01:09:48,675
going to allow myself to be destroyed by foolish and stupid

1169
01:09:48,704 --> 01:09:49,970
ideas that are around.

1170
01:09:51,638 --> 01:09:54,436
And then in your own estimation and glory

1171
01:09:54,936 --> 01:09:57,811
you will be surprised. After realisation

1172
01:09:57,821 --> 01:10:00,012
you will be enriched but

1173
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:01,965
without Realisation, I don't know,

1174
01:10:02,051 --> 01:10:05,107
it becomes a lecture and a lecture, just a brainwash.

1175
01:10:05,965 --> 01:10:07,965
That beautiful thing should happen to you,

1176
01:10:08,314 --> 01:10:11,811
and once you find your beauty within yourself,

1177
01:10:11,859 --> 01:10:14,217
overnight I have seen people changed.

1178
01:10:14,868 --> 01:10:16,868
Overnight it happens

1179
01:10:17,368 --> 01:10:20,727
and I hope that will happen to you tonight.

1180
01:10:21,227 --> 01:10:24,472
Today I have talked to you about this centre

1181
01:10:24,972 --> 01:10:27,615
and later on I will be talking to you about

1182
01:10:28,021 --> 01:10:30,438
two other centres which are here and here.

1183
01:10:30,656 --> 01:10:32,656
And the Realisation that takes place,

1184
01:10:33,156 --> 01:10:35,156
out of the limbic area,

1185
01:10:35,373 --> 01:10:37,973
in the fontanel membrane,

1186
01:10:38,249 --> 01:10:40,830
which is called as the Brahmarandra in Sanskrit language.

1187
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:43,330
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

1188
01:10:44,885 --> 01:10:47,425
If you have any questions you please ask me.

1189
01:10:49,827 --> 01:10:52,690
But questions should be something

1190
01:10:53,161 --> 01:10:55,328
which are helpful, not some sort of

1191
01:10:55,365 --> 01:10:57,222
quarrel. I am not here to quarrel with you.

1192
01:10:57,553 --> 01:11:00,266
If you don't want your Realisation I am not going to force you.

1193
01:11:00,766 --> 01:11:05,105
Please do not plead for any other organisation or any other guru,

1194
01:11:05,605 --> 01:11:08,732
because I am not interested. I am only interested in you,

1195
01:11:09,082 --> 01:11:11,082
I see that sparkle in you,

1196
01:11:11,155 --> 01:11:14,023
that's why I am only interested in you, I'm not bothered about others.

1197
01:11:14,523 --> 01:11:16,975
So you do not try to bring others ideas

1198
01:11:17,176 --> 01:11:19,002
that this guru has said this or this

1199
01:11:19,022 --> 01:11:20,785
one has said that and this is in the book.

1200
01:11:21,647 --> 01:11:24,249
The proof of the pudding is that you haven't got your Realisation.

1201
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:26,279
If you have got it then you can go out.

1202
01:11:28,403 --> 01:11:30,948
If you are sure you have got it, I don't want to force it on you.

1203
01:11:31,063 --> 01:11:32,784
There's no quarrel about anything.

1204
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:35,070
There's no election on, nothing.

1205
01:11:35,314 --> 01:11:36,523
You cannot give me anything.

1206
01:11:36,574 --> 01:11:39,638
There's no shopping. It's a temple, you have come for a blessing.

1207
01:11:40,138 --> 01:11:43,091
All right? Now you can ask the questions. Thank you very much.
