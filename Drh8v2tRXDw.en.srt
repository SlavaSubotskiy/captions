1
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:39,355
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Ganesha.

2
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:48,355
You all know what a powerful deity He is.

3
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:53,694
His power comes from his innocence.

4
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:58,496
When we see small children we are automatically

5
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:02,115
compelled towards them

6
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:09,635
and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with them.

7
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:14,555
And very innocent they are,

8
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:18,155
extremely innocent,

9
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:24,675
and when we worship Shri Ganesha

10
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:31,635
we have to know if we have been really innocent or not.

11
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:38,515
These days people have become extremely cunning,

12
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:42,315
and they don’t mind any amount of cunning.

13
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,875
They play all kinds of cunning games on others

14
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:49,915
who are innocent and simple.

15
00:05:50,075 --> 00:05:53,315
They can justify themselves always

16
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:58,395
that whatever they are doing is the right thing in these modern times

17
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:01,675
when everybody is so cunning.

18
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:11,915
This cunningness can take you to the other extreme of right side,

19
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:15,235
which is very much punishable,

20
00:06:15,515 --> 00:06:21,075
in the sense that some people develop all kinds of problems,

21
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:25,075
which are physical, you can say.

22
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:33,395
Like their hands can get paralyzed or their leg can get paralyzed.

23
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:37,595
Also, they can have other troubles

24
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:41,275
with their liver treatments and all that.

25
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:47,315
All this comes up. Then to punish them

26
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:52,995
a disease of psychosomatic nature might set in.

27
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:56,395
At this time, when you have these problems,

28
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:59,795
all such people, who suffer from the right side,

29
00:06:59,955 --> 00:07:02,835
should worship Shri Ganesha.

30
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:10,395
For example these days, life is very much busy with all of you.

31
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:15,875
You are extremely busy with your work and you are doing

32
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:20,075
extra work, I should say, than normal.

33
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:24,795
But you think you are doing a very great job of God.

34
00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:29,235
As a result Shri Ganesha is neglected

35
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:36,715
and such a man can become either very dry or very self indulgent.

36
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,515
One of the two things come up

37
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:43,835
and he does not know where he is going.

38
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:50,035
The only thing that keeps you in the middle,

39
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:54,675
in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

40
00:07:54,835 --> 00:08:02,035
Shri Ganesha’s worship by which you can always be in the center.

41
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:05,392
All these diseases of the right side

42
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:09,955
can be cured by Shri Ganesha’s Puja.

43
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:15,915
Now there are various ways people worship Shri Ganesha

44
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:23,355
but there is a simple way to remember him

45
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:28,915
and sit before his photograph and take vibrations from him.

46
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,835
That’s the best way you can balance yourself.

47
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:37,755
There are so many worries, there are so many struggles you have.

48
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:41,595
All these can be neutralized by Shri Ganesha.

49
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:46,475
Though innocent, He is extremely clever

50
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:51,315
and when he comes to your help you are amazed.

51
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:56,275
How he works it out and how he removes all the hurdles

52
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,955
and all the worries from you.

53
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:03,035
So this is the most important deity we have.

54
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:06,395
Though its a very simple deity.

55
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:10,075
This Mooladhara chakra is very very complicated.

56
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:13,435
It is one of the most complicated, chakras I think,

57
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:22,115
because it has many waves, it has many compartments.

58
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:29,115
We can say which all the time are vibrating and oscillating.

59
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:31,995
So to steady down these

60
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:39,195
you should try to be absolutely dedicated to Shri Ganesha.

61
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:46,395
Shri Ganesha, as I told you, was incarnated as Jesus Christ,

62
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:51,355
and Jesus was also a very innocent person.

63
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:55,515
If he was not innocent, He would not have been crucified,

64
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:59,835
but he was not a cunning fellow to see the cunning of others.

65
00:09:59,995 --> 00:10:05,235
His own disciple deceived him and still he knew who it was,

66
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,355
he never said who it was.

67
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:12,315
If you see his life, its full of innocent beauty,

68
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:18,915
is such a simple hearted personality, such a good personality

69
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:21,795
and wherever he saw anything wrong done

70
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,635
he used to go all out to fight it.

71
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:26,755
Same is Shri Ganesha.

72
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:31,835
Shri Ganesha’s blessings are very important for all the people

73
00:10:31,995 --> 00:10:36,875
who are specially prone to some sort of a hurdle

74
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:40,195
or ‘Sankata as they call it’. He is called as Sankata Vimochan,

75
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:45,035
the one who takes you out of all the hurdles of life.

76
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:49,475
So many of you have experienced how he has helped you

77
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:54,235
in different troubles and hurdles and also

78
00:10:54,395 --> 00:10:57,875
different type of very very difficult times.

79
00:10:58,035 --> 00:11:02,475
It is his style that he manages things so well

80
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:05,315
because he is a Ganapati.

81
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:11,435
Ganapati means the one who is the Lord of the Ganas.

82
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:16,195
As I have told you Ganas exist within us.

83
00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:24,355
Very nicely settled down as these bodies, small, small bodies

84
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:28,435
who report if there is any problem.

85
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:32,715
They report to the brain that there is a problem

86
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:39,515
and on the sternum bone is the residence

87
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:45,315
or you can say the throne of the Goddess Durga.

88
00:11:45,475 --> 00:11:54,315
So whenever there is any problem we are found into some trouble,

89
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:58,035
sternum bone starts vibrating

90
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:04,675
and these bodies which are Ganas get the information.

91
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:08,835
Antibodies they are called in the medical terminology.

92
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:13,955
Then these Ganas attack. They can target also.

93
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:18,075
They know how to target the troubles and attack it,

94
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:22,195
one may think that only the people who are suffering medically

95
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:24,995
are helped by Ganas is not true.

96
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:28,475
Also the people who are mentally upset,

97
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:33,355
who are mentally suffering are also helped by the Ganas.

98
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:38,635
These Ganas are so good at targeting their problems

99
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:43,715
that sometimes we are surprised how things are worked out.

100
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:50,355
For example say something happens to someone, some child, somewhere.

101
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:55,155
Now his parents start crying for Mother

102
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:59,275
and the Mother is the Durga say, then what happens,

103
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:03,035
that they immediately rush to that place

104
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:07,675
and miraculously they cure the boy, miraculously they say.

105
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:11,435
So many miraculous thing that have happened in your life

106
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:18,235
you cannot explain, but they are all due to this Ganapati’s Ganas.

107
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:21,995
They are also small like him

108
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:25,755
and they are very active and very alert.

109
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:27,875
They never sleep.

110
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:32,075
Anytime there is any trouble these Ganas will go

111
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:37,075
and attack the problem and find out solution for him.

112
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:43,395
It is something unbelievable how they act and how they inform.

113
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:47,795
I can give you so many examples that have happened like this.

114
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:52,115
For example there was a boy who got drowned

115
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:58,515
in one of our ashrams in America in the swimming pool.

116
00:13:58,675 --> 00:14:00,595
They were all jumping in the swimming pool,

117
00:14:00,755 --> 00:14:03,315
I didn’t like the idea of swimming pool very much

118
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,635
because there were children.

119
00:14:05,795 --> 00:14:08,355
So one boy fell down into that

120
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,715
and was inside for about 15 to 20 minutes.

121
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,835
Nobody knew he was there.

122
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:19,515
So then they tried to find out the body of the boy

123
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:23,235
and then they found out he was not there. Where has he gone?

124
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:28,195
Then they discovered that he was in that swimming pool.

125
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:31,875
After that they got so frightened

126
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:35,635
and they said we just prayed to you, Mother to save this boy.

127
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:38,315
Surprisingly, I never telephone to any Ashram,

128
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:40,745
I didn’t know even the address.

129
00:14:40,905 --> 00:14:45,315
But I asked to telephone to this number,

130
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:48,395
on my own. I don’t know anybody’s numbers

131
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:54,155
and, when I telephoned, one of the leaders came there

132
00:14:54,315 --> 00:14:57,395
and I told him I know the boy has fallen into the water

133
00:14:57,555 --> 00:14:59,115
and he will be saved.

134
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:01,275
Nobody had told me anything.

135
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:04,035
“Don’t worry he will be perfectly alright.”

136
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:08,875
Then they brought out the boy and he was treated

137
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:12,915
by the doctors also but also with vibrations

138
00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:15,595
and today that boy is perfectly alright,

139
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:18,635
while the doctors had said he can never survive.

140
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:21,235
If there is one chance of his surviving,

141
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:26,315
he will be like a dead body, in a coma all the time.

142
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:29,435
This boy, I have met him this time, when I went to America.

143
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,515
So, like this, so many things happen

144
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:37,635
and people tell me that Mother its your ‘kripa’,

145
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:41,235
your blessings that this has happened.

146
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:44,235
In a way, it is very distantly, I should say,

147
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:46,835
but because of Shri Ganesha.

148
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:49,475
Now Shri Ganesha’s another quality is that

149
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:52,995
he is extremely obedient to Mother.

150
00:15:53,155 --> 00:15:58,995
He does not recognize even Shiva, Vihnu, any one.

151
00:15:59,155 --> 00:16:02,595
To him his Mother is everything.

152
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:05,755
So he can fight with his father, Shiva,

153
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:11,435
he can fight with anyone because to him is complete obedience

154
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:18,955
and absolutely quick ‘Tatpar’, just quickly understands

155
00:16:19,115 --> 00:16:23,715
what is the desire of the Mother and he works it out.

156
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:29,275
His style is otherwise very innocent, simple, child like

157
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:32,595
but His work is tremendous.

158
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:37,475
Now these Ganas are also very innocent people, very innocent

159
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:43,395
but when told that you have to attend to a particular problem,

160
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:47,235
they are extremely quick and they are very fast.

161
00:16:47,395 --> 00:16:53,515
The another thing within is that he respects people who are chaste,

162
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:58,195
who have chastity as the prime thing in their life.

163
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:00,795
Chastity is very much worshipped by him.

164
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:03,955
Its not only in women but also in men,

165
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:07,275
he expects chastity to be present.

166
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:12,635
After getting realization you should be absolutely chaste people,

167
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:16,035
you shouldn’t have your eyes rolling around every where

168
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:22,115
and sort of what you can call a very bad method

169
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:26,435
of communicating with young women and young men

170
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:29,355
and spoiling your chastity.

171
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,355
Even your eyes should be clean,

172
00:17:32,515 --> 00:17:35,035
even your thoughts should be cleaned.

173
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:39,115
For that you should introspect and see for yourself

174
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:41,715
what mistakes you have committed

175
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:48,715
and what kind of an unchaste behavior you have.

176
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:54,155
You have to correct yourself and ask Shri Ganesha to forgive you.

177
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:57,675
If you ask for forgiveness, he can forgive anything.

178
00:17:57,835 --> 00:18:02,075
He is so innocent and beautiful that he forgives you,

179
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:04,875
but that is a very important thing.

180
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:10,195
Our whole morality depends on our idea of chastity.

181
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,915
We should be very chaste.

182
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:16,115
So many religions have come and they have talked about chastity.

183
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:19,915
But religions have become so useless now,

184
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:23,355
have become without any basis,

185
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:34,035
without any proper execution, of what is written for them.

186
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:37,595
They do all kinds of things and they call themselves

187
00:18:37,755 --> 00:18:41,955
Hindus, Muslims, Christians, all kinds of religions.

188
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:45,155
Actually the religions have failed completely

189
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:50,155
and that’s why Shri Ganesha gets after them.

190
00:18:50,315 --> 00:18:52,435
Another thing about Shri Ganesh

191
00:18:52,595 --> 00:18:55,795
is that he is created out of the Mother earth.

192
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:59,475
He is absolutely created out of the mother Earth.

193
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:06,315
So if he doesn’t like people of some country,

194
00:19:06,475 --> 00:19:11,275
who are doing black magic, or who are doing fundamentalism

195
00:19:11,435 --> 00:19:18,035
and where people are also having very bad morals.

196
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:22,835
He creates problems for them. What happens that

197
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:29,875
He tells the Mother earth to create the earthquakes.

198
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,419
Earthquake takes place in places where

199
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:36,235
there is no respect of chastity,

200
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:40,235
also where there are fundamentalist

201
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:47,235
and also where there are people who are worshipping the black magic.

202
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:52,155
This kind of people are attacked by him through his Mother.

203
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:54,595
So the Mother earth also understands.

204
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:58,195
Now we have so many earthquakes,

205
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:00,635
one in Turkey you know, one in Taiwan,

206
00:20:00,795 --> 00:20:03,795
but not a single Sahaja Yogi has died.

207
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:05,715
So he protects them.

208
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:10,595
He has discrimination and only such people, who are of this kind,

209
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:12,795
he tries to destroy them,

210
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:16,915
and he has destroyed many like this even before.

211
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:27,835
Also, the Mother earth’s powers he has got, is that he is magnetic,

212
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:30,715
he attracts people towards himself,

213
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:35,715
people take to him very easily as we take to children very easily.

214
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:40,515
So that is magnetic power that he has got within himself.

215
00:20:40,675 --> 00:20:46,195
Now, you will be surprised this magnet exists also in the birds,

216
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:49,395
also in many animals but specially in the birds.

217
00:20:49,555 --> 00:20:53,115
That’s how they can follow direction where they have to go.

218
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:57,875
They are flying from, say Siberia, all the way, flying to Australia.

219
00:20:58,035 --> 00:21:01,595
How do they fly? And again they come back to the same place.

220
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:08,275
It also is in the fishes. Fishes also are found say

221
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:13,195
in the waters which are coming from some hills,

222
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:17,755
so they come to the plains for some time and again God knows how,

223
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:20,075
they go back to their own place.

224
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:23,435
So going back to the same place is only possible

225
00:21:23,595 --> 00:21:26,435
if there is a way of knowing the direction.

226
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:30,875
But they know the direction, they have a sense of direction,

227
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:34,995
also they are bound by their own qualities.

228
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:40,035
For example a snake will be a snake, a dog will be a dog,

229
00:21:40,195 --> 00:21:42,435
and a lion will be a lion.

230
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:46,195
But human beings have perhaps all the animals within them.

231
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:48,475
So they could be anything, you can’t say

232
00:21:48,635 --> 00:21:52,515
and they are too cunning to admit that they can be anything.

233
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:55,275
And once they become anything like that

234
00:21:55,435 --> 00:22:00,035
you are amazed how these people can be of such a low level

235
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,595
when they are human beings.

236
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:07,355
But it is so because Ganesha has not been respected in their lives.

237
00:22:07,515 --> 00:22:12,435
So they can go to any level, any place. Another example,

238
00:22:12,595 --> 00:22:16,915
I give you a very big earthquake we had in India, in Latur.

239
00:22:17,075 --> 00:22:21,915
In Latur this was the fourteenth day of Shri Ganesha

240
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:24,995
where they take Shri Ganesha and put it in the sea

241
00:22:25,155 --> 00:22:29,595
or in the water of a river. So there, in Latur,

242
00:22:29,755 --> 00:22:37,435
these people have been having a nice statue of Shri Ganesha.

243
00:22:37,595 --> 00:22:39,635
Before the statue they dance

244
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:46,195
and they have now started playing very dirty, very bad,

245
00:22:46,355 --> 00:22:51,875
music from some very funny films or something.

246
00:22:52,035 --> 00:22:54,995
It’s so bad that you just can’t bear it.

247
00:22:55,155 --> 00:22:59,275
Very bad and that upsets Shri Ganesha.

248
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:03,635
So like that they were doing to this one statue that they had

249
00:23:03,795 --> 00:23:06,075
and they were dancing before it.

250
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:11,835
But when they put the statue in the water and they came back home,

251
00:23:11,995 --> 00:23:16,275
they got drunk and when they got drunk, they started dancing

252
00:23:16,435 --> 00:23:20,795
with that drinking and saying Jai Ganesha, Jai Ganesha.

253
00:23:20,955 --> 00:23:24,435
At that time the earth moved

254
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:34,195
and the earthquake took away all of them inside the earth itself.

255
00:23:34,355 --> 00:23:36,675
They all disappeared into earth.

256
00:23:36,835 --> 00:23:39,995
Apart from that there were many others also

257
00:23:40,155 --> 00:23:44,395
who were doing this kind of thing, were taken into the mother earth.

258
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:48,235
And our Ashram was there, a kind of a center

259
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:55,995
and around the center there was a very beautiful land

260
00:23:56,155 --> 00:24:02,075
but he did not touch that land. Around is about at least

261
00:24:02,235 --> 00:24:07,355
quite a long distance, a big gap came in

262
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:16,635
and there was a opening in the mother earth all around the center

263
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:21,755
and nobody was harmed: They were all at home.

264
00:24:22,075 --> 00:24:24,235
They were all right.

265
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:29,355
But this happened, that our Ashram was not at all touched

266
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:32,031
and this is how they saved the Ashram

267
00:24:32,191 --> 00:24:34,995
and not a single Sahaja Yogi died.

268
00:24:35,155 --> 00:24:39,395
It is really very remarkable how the protection is given

269
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:43,315
by Shri Ganesha and his Ganas.

270
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:45,955
So we must respect his Ganas,

271
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:50,715
very important is to see that they are all around within us,

272
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,915
they are acting within us.

273
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:56,235
They see us what sort of person you are,

274
00:24:56,395 --> 00:25:01,155
and in case you try to dislodge Shri Ganesha

275
00:25:01,315 --> 00:25:03,318
by your misbehavior

276
00:25:03,478 --> 00:25:07,755
they try to see that you again go back to normal.

277
00:25:07,915 --> 00:25:09,915
They give you a chance many a times.

278
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:17,555
But even then you go on with your cunning and ideas about your ego,

279
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:24,275
you are very badly hit by him and that is the biggest,

280
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:28,355
I should say, calamity for you people.

281
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:31,115
So you must worship Shri Ganesha

282
00:25:31,275 --> 00:25:34,515
but I always say don’t worship every Shri Ganesha

283
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:40,075
which is being created by those, we can say, artisans.

284
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:43,275
Because God knows what sort of Artisans they are.

285
00:25:43,435 --> 00:25:45,955
For money’s sake they might be making Ganesha

286
00:25:46,115 --> 00:25:52,515
and they might not have got any idea of Chastity.

287
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:57,475
Such people make these Ganesha and then you worship those Ganeshas,

288
00:25:57,635 --> 00:26:00,355
so we are not at all helped by this.

289
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:03,235
That’s why Mohammad Saheb has said,

290
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,155
don’t do any worship of any idol

291
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:11,035
because these idols have been created by human beings

292
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:15,835
who are not authorized to do that. They are not Swayambhus.

293
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:18,315
They are not created by the mother earth

294
00:26:18,475 --> 00:26:21,234
but are copied by people

295
00:26:21,394 --> 00:26:24,875
who are just wanting to make money out of them.

296
00:26:25,035 --> 00:26:28,675
So that’s, how any idol you get,

297
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:34,955
say, from the shops need not be worshiped,

298
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:38,315
it is not to be worshiped, any idol whatsoever.

299
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:41,155
So whatever is not there,

300
00:26:41,315 --> 00:26:45,355
we should not worship because it is made by somebody

301
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:48,955
who has very bad vibrations, who is a cheat,

302
00:26:49,115 --> 00:26:53,075
who is very cunning and thinks no end of himself.

303
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:56,475
With such a person if you buy a Shri Ganesha

304
00:26:56,635 --> 00:26:59,515
it is going to harm you, is not going to help you.

305
00:26:59,675 --> 00:27:04,315
You can have it for decoration in the house but not for worship.

306
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:08,355
There is no photograph of real Shri Ganesha, no photograph.

307
00:27:08,515 --> 00:27:14,835
There are eight Shri Ganeshas who came out of mother earth.

308
00:27:14,995 --> 00:27:20,235
I have seen them. But in those places the pujaris,

309
00:27:20,395 --> 00:27:24,515
the people who are the priest are horrible, horrible people.

310
00:27:24,675 --> 00:27:29,195
I went to one of them and he said, “I am getting Asthama”,

311
00:27:29,355 --> 00:27:34,115
“I am getting paralysis, how is it I am worshipping Shri Ganesha,

312
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:37,315
my forefathers have worshipped Shri Ganesha

313
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:40,515
and how he is doing this to us.”

314
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:47,035
I said, you just introspect yourself, what kind of a life you lead,

315
00:27:47,195 --> 00:27:53,275
what do you do, are you really worthy of Shri Ganesha’s Pujari?

316
00:27:53,435 --> 00:27:54,795
And then he realized it.

317
00:27:54,955 --> 00:27:57,635
I said, “I will cure you now. Its all right

318
00:27:57,795 --> 00:28:03,075
but afterwards you see to it that you become an innocent personality.

319
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:07,515
Try to lead an innocent life, not of outwitting another

320
00:28:07,675 --> 00:28:10,195
and being very cunning and clever.

321
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,915
Shri Ganesha’s troubles, are really, I can’t count them even,

322
00:28:15,075 --> 00:28:22,355
how much it can hamper, or how much it can give you trouble,

323
00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:27,875
how much it can take you nearer to your death.

324
00:28:28,035 --> 00:28:33,115
He is so powerful, because all his energy is

325
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:36,395
for the divine work of his Mother, all his energy.

326
00:28:36,555 --> 00:28:39,315
He doesn’t do anything, he doesn’t want anything.

327
00:28:39,475 --> 00:28:45,715
Just all his energy is for that and he is asking for what is simple,

328
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:48,955
what you can call Modaka, a kind of a thing

329
00:28:49,115 --> 00:28:54,635
they make out of coconut. That’s what he eats.

330
00:28:54,795 --> 00:29:01,675
His body is so subtle and so, so powerful

331
00:29:01,835 --> 00:29:10,075
that he can move mountains after mountains.

332
00:29:10,235 --> 00:29:16,635
With his simplicity, with his sweetness, and with his innocence

333
00:29:16,795 --> 00:29:23,955
he can really change people. People who are very harsh,

334
00:29:24,115 --> 00:29:27,235
can be changed.

335
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:32,955
His symbol as we have seen is a Swastika,

336
00:29:33,115 --> 00:29:35,195
of the right direction.

337
00:29:35,355 --> 00:29:41,235
But if it is the other way round Swastika, then that can destroy.

338
00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:45,795
When It was used by Hitler in the beginning,

339
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:49,315
it was the right type and he was successful.

340
00:29:49,475 --> 00:29:52,475
But then what happened, they had stencils

341
00:29:52,635 --> 00:29:55,235
and they started using it from the other side.

342
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:58,515
So it was from the left side, they started other way round

343
00:29:58,675 --> 00:30:01,795
and then they were all destroyed.

344
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:05,915
How powerful is Shri Ganesha’s Swastika, you can say.

345
00:30:06,075 --> 00:30:08,163
Also we have proved now

346
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:12,275
that Swastika if you see from left to the right,

347
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:15,995
is actually from the Carbon atom.

348
00:30:16,155 --> 00:30:18,715
The carbon atom has got Swastika

349
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:25,675
and the whole of this chakra is made of Carbon atoms,

350
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:27,715
all put in series.

351
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:33,035
Now if you look at it from the left side, you have proved it now,

352
00:30:33,195 --> 00:30:35,755
look at it from the left side to right side,

353
00:30:35,915 --> 00:30:39,755
what you see is Omkar.

354
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:42,555
If you see it from right side to left side,

355
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,315
you see the Swastika,

356
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:51,195
and if you see from down below upward then it looks like a Cross.

357
00:30:51,355 --> 00:30:56,555
So it proves that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ

358
00:30:56,715 --> 00:31:01,395
and he is the one who is worshipped all over the world,

359
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:04,995
is already written in the Devi Mahatmayam if you read it,

360
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:09,075
is all clearly written about him how he became an egg

361
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:12,395
and out of the half of the egg became Christ

362
00:31:12,555 --> 00:31:17,155
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesha.

363
00:31:17,315 --> 00:31:21,355
All these things are there but we cannot understand it

364
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:23,115
because we are confused.

365
00:31:23,275 --> 00:31:25,395
We don’t want to see it in a proper sense

366
00:31:25,555 --> 00:31:27,435
that this is already written there.

367
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:33,035
So those who worship Christ, also worship Shri Ganesha

368
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:40,435
and whatever you say to Christ you are saying it to Shri Ganesha.

369
00:31:40,595 --> 00:31:46,715
They are not two, they are one and absolutely one with each other.

370
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,715
All the things I have told you about Christ,

371
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:56,195
you can try to find out and you will prove it.

372
00:31:56,355 --> 00:31:59,355
Like Christ had these two fingers,

373
00:31:59,515 --> 00:32:03,835
this means one finger is for the Vishudhi as we say Shri Krishna

374
00:32:03,995 --> 00:32:08,475
and this one is Vishnu’s means this is his father’s.

375
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:12,355
That means his father was Vishnu or Shri Krishna.

376
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:16,035
Very clearly he used to do, why didn’t he use other fingers,

377
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:18,795
only these two fingers why did he use.

378
00:32:18,955 --> 00:32:21,620
Pointing out towards his father

379
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,695
who was Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna.

380
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:29,275
It is easy to understand what I am saying,

381
00:32:29,435 --> 00:32:32,755
if you see the vibrations of Shri Ganesha.

382
00:32:32,915 --> 00:32:39,595
If you see his vibrations and think of him you will be amazed,

383
00:32:39,755 --> 00:32:45,155
that your Agnya will open out, you will become thoughtless,

384
00:32:45,315 --> 00:32:49,315
because he is the Jesus and he is on the Agnya.

385
00:32:49,475 --> 00:32:51,251
So it all opens out

386
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:56,827
and all the stupid ideas about wrecking the Agnya,

387
00:32:56,995 --> 00:33:00,955
this and that is all neutralized because you see for yourself,

388
00:33:01,115 --> 00:33:06,235
just the name of Shri Ganesha can open your Agnya.

389
00:33:06,395 --> 00:33:10,395
The cunningness that comes from Agnya is absolutely finished.

390
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,355
You are no more cunning.

391
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:19,075
When you see this innocence on your forehead,

392
00:33:19,235 --> 00:33:24,315
you are amazed at yourself and all such ideas just disappear.

393
00:33:24,475 --> 00:33:29,475
You cannot think of something very cunning and harmful to others.

394
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:36,435
You are completely changed when the Agnya is absolutely opened out.

395
00:33:36,595 --> 00:33:41,315
This one is a very big blessing to us that we all have

396
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:45,675
this Muladhara Chakra now put into proper thing.

397
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:48,875
When you sit on the ground also it helps more

398
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:55,086
because the mother of Shri Ganesha

399
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:59,006
is this Prithvi, is this earth, the mother earth

400
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:02,595
and that’s why we should look after the mother earth.

401
00:34:02,755 --> 00:34:04,755
We don’t look after the mother earth.

402
00:34:04,915 --> 00:34:08,235
We don’t understand the value of mother earth.

403
00:34:08,395 --> 00:34:12,355
Actually in Indian culture it is that

404
00:34:12,515 --> 00:34:15,515
when you are getting up in the morning,

405
00:34:15,675 --> 00:34:20,595
you must say Namaskar to the Mother earth

406
00:34:20,755 --> 00:34:25,035
because saying that I bow to you, O, Mother earth

407
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:28,275
because I am touching you with my feet.

408
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:30,755
Such respect you should have for Mother earth,

409
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:32,635
then you won’t exploit it,

410
00:34:32,795 --> 00:34:36,395
you won’t have today’s problems of pollution and this and that.

411
00:34:36,555 --> 00:34:39,395
It all comes out of our ignorance

412
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:43,955
that the Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha

413
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:47,795
who’s chakra we have got as Mooladhara.

414
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:52,435
If you understand this you will be able to understand,

415
00:34:52,595 --> 00:34:55,515
what is to be done.

416
00:34:55,675 --> 00:34:58,595
The mother earth itself we should look after,

417
00:34:58,755 --> 00:35:02,355
we can glorify her, we can beautify her,

418
00:35:02,515 --> 00:35:04,755
we can do all kinds of things

419
00:35:04,915 --> 00:35:10,435
but the way we are exploiting the mother earth is a wrong idea,

420
00:35:10,595 --> 00:35:15,275
is very wrong because it is harming us with pollution.

421
00:35:15,435 --> 00:35:18,515
To cut down the trees, to cut down every thing

422
00:35:18,675 --> 00:35:23,235
that mother has produced and just to use it for money

423
00:35:23,395 --> 00:35:25,275
is a very wrong thing.

424
00:35:25,435 --> 00:35:29,035
One should think about it and when you cut one tree also

425
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:31,195
you should put another one there.

426
00:35:31,355 --> 00:35:34,715
That is the beauty of the Mother earth,

427
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:39,315
all the greenery, every thing is the beauty of the Mother earth.

428
00:35:39,475 --> 00:35:46,915
Many people have no interest in gardening or in nature, no interest.

429
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:50,275
I don’t know how they live but they do

430
00:35:50,435 --> 00:35:56,435
without taking any interest in gardening or in the nature.

431
00:35:56,595 --> 00:36:00,475
Nature is so beautiful, just look at the nature,

432
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:06,515
it is never smelling, is never dirty, every leaf is so organized

433
00:36:06,675 --> 00:36:09,675
that it should get the sunrays.

434
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,395
There is no quarrel about it.

435
00:36:11,555 --> 00:36:15,195
They are so well organized, everything is so beautiful

436
00:36:15,355 --> 00:36:20,475
and it is never destroyed also by any animals. You will be amazed.

437
00:36:20,635 --> 00:36:22,835
The animals also don’t destroy,

438
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:26,035
at the most they might eat some grass or something,

439
00:36:26,195 --> 00:36:29,875
but normally animals do not destroy any tree,

440
00:36:30,035 --> 00:36:32,515
do not destroy anything

441
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:38,555
as we destroy the Mother earth for our own use.

442
00:36:38,715 --> 00:36:41,835
Whatever may be the cry for this,

443
00:36:41,995 --> 00:36:45,755
we have to understand that we have to respect to the Mother earth.

444
00:36:45,915 --> 00:36:48,755
Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha,

445
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,875
who is our, you should say the eldest Sahaja Yogi.

446
00:36:53,035 --> 00:36:57,875
He never had to take to yoga but he is in Yoga all the time.

447
00:36:58,035 --> 00:37:00,435
He is the greatest yogi we have

448
00:37:00,595 --> 00:37:04,035
and the way he is doing right things all the time.

449
00:37:04,195 --> 00:37:10,315
He never does anything wrong, never and he is so capable

450
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:18,835
of getting to the position of any great deity that is possible,

451
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:21,715
I would say. He is the greatest deity we have

452
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,835
and we should really worship him.

453
00:37:23,995 --> 00:37:26,645
Through him all deities are worshiped

454
00:37:26,805 --> 00:37:34,035
and are made happy and blissful.

455
00:37:34,195 --> 00:37:39,675
So this is today’s thing was that I was just thinking that

456
00:37:39,835 --> 00:37:44,955
nowadays, in modern times how we have become shameless,

457
00:37:45,115 --> 00:37:56,235
how we have tried to trouble our chastity, for kind of a honor.

458
00:37:56,395 --> 00:38:00,875
If we have any honor you will have the chastity

459
00:38:01,035 --> 00:38:04,035
but you are dishonoring yourself

460
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:07,635
and you think you have been very very smart and modern

461
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:13,475
by becoming so sinful.

462
00:38:13,635 --> 00:38:17,115
All the sinful act that is going on in these modern times

463
00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:23,515
is absolutely wrong and it should be completely, we should abhor it.

464
00:38:23,675 --> 00:38:27,155
You should go no way near because that’s all wrong

465
00:38:27,315 --> 00:38:30,835
and that’s how Shri Ganesha gets angry.

466
00:38:30,995 --> 00:38:34,915
Decency is very important in understanding,

467
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:41,075
what is our important basis, is our chastity.

468
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:47,595
In India you know thirty two thousand women got themselves burnt

469
00:38:47,755 --> 00:38:51,835
for saving their chastity. I come from the same family

470
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:55,755
and you can imagine what courage they must be having,

471
00:38:55,915 --> 00:39:00,153
what faith they must be having, in their chastity

472
00:39:00,313 --> 00:39:03,988
that if we lose our chastity what’s the use of our life.

473
00:39:04,148 --> 00:39:09,924
So they cared for their chastity, have done so much sacrifice

474
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:14,475
to show that chastity is the most important thing, we all should have.

475
00:39:14,635 --> 00:39:19,378
Its not only for women but also for men, very much more for men.

476
00:39:19,538 --> 00:39:21,766
Shri Ganesha is very important thing

477
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,388
because men can develop so many diseases

478
00:39:24,548 --> 00:39:28,196
if they do not respect Shri Ganesha.

479
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:36,092
Our health would be the best if we look after Shri Ganesha

480
00:39:36,252 --> 00:39:39,451
because he is all the time repairing our body.

481
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:43,296
He is all the time looking after, protecting us

482
00:39:43,456 --> 00:39:49,307
and our Shri Ganesha is in the Mooladhara.

483
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:52,220
He is the one who is looking after our Kundalini,

484
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,755
he is protecting our Kundalini.

485
00:39:54,915 --> 00:40:01,494
If any thing happens to us the Kundalini comes up

486
00:40:01,654 --> 00:40:07,252
but the one who supports her and, keeps her up,

487
00:40:07,412 --> 00:40:11,696
awakened and standing is Shri Ganesha. He works it out.

488
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:15,875
He is the one who is the protector of our Kundalini

489
00:40:16,035 --> 00:40:22,896
which is also a basis of your self realization.

490
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:26,494
So how much important is Shri Ganesha you should know,

491
00:40:26,654 --> 00:40:29,431
and you should find out about yourself,

492
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:34,210
introspect that are we really dedicated to Shri Ganesha?

493
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,755
If we are; what are we doing about it?

494
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:43,096
Then you will develop a real hatred for all these dirty things.

495
00:40:43,256 --> 00:40:46,018
You will not like them, will not like such people.

496
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:49,300
That is how a Sahaja Yogi should work it out.

497
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,374
The children are the best as we know.

498
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:59,961
Children are so sweet and so kind, they are so loving, so beautiful.

499
00:41:00,121 --> 00:41:04,336
In the same way we should know Shri Ganesha is there.

500
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:07,831
He is the one who is really innocent

501
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:12,239
but extremely, protective of you,

502
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:15,873
very much protective, with his innocence.

503
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:18,609
So we should also try to cherish our innocence

504
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:22,515
and not to feel hurt because sometime such people are cheated,

505
00:41:22,675 --> 00:41:25,359
dominated, every thing happens, doesn’t matter.

506
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:28,809
They will all suffer who will dominate innocent people.

507
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:34,030
As the whole world, you see, there is a big uproar about it,

508
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,355
people are talking about it that

509
00:41:36,515 --> 00:41:40,579
there should not be domination of the innocent simple people.

510
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:43,934
It has happened but it all has to be changed,

511
00:41:44,094 --> 00:41:50,875
has to be brought to some last end otherwise people can not exist,

512
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:55,593
like everywhere they went and oppressed so many people.

513
00:41:55,753 --> 00:41:59,403
In America, I was surprised to see that

514
00:41:59,563 --> 00:42:02,315
there were so many Red Indians,

515
00:42:02,475 --> 00:42:06,315
who are called as Indian Americans.

516
00:42:06,475 --> 00:42:11,602
They were all oppressed so much that they had to run away

517
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:15,913
to different places and then I went to this place Canajoharie.

518
00:42:16,073 --> 00:42:18,715
I found the vibrations were so good.

519
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:21,515
That means they were very innocent, simple people

520
00:42:21,675 --> 00:42:24,694
and Americans that time, who went there,

521
00:42:24,854 --> 00:42:27,715
tried to completely finish them.

522
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:31,204
So they went and hid in places like Canajoharie

523
00:42:31,364 --> 00:42:34,955
but the Canajoharie has such tremendous vibrations

524
00:42:35,115 --> 00:42:37,965
that I said look at this, so many years have passed,

525
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:41,835
still the people who live there or worked about

526
00:42:41,995 --> 00:42:47,136
and were absolutely enjoying this place were Red Indians,

527
00:42:47,296 --> 00:42:51,869
the ones who were Indians, we call them American Indians.

528
00:42:52,029 --> 00:42:54,204
But they are so simple and innocent

529
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:57,315
and they were so, I think, spiritual people

530
00:42:57,475 --> 00:43:00,115
because they used to worship the Mother.

531
00:43:00,275 --> 00:43:02,915
All the time they worship the Mother.

532
00:43:03,075 --> 00:43:06,675
Even I have seen in other countries it has happened

533
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:11,935
but I was happy to see that in Australia they are very secular.

534
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:14,895
They have many Maoris and all those people

535
00:43:15,055 --> 00:43:16,775
and they encourage all of them

536
00:43:16,935 --> 00:43:20,775
and its so surprising that they have so much talent

537
00:43:20,935 --> 00:43:28,018
and they are bringing them to this state to show

538
00:43:28,184 --> 00:43:32,891
that they are equal in their rights, political rights, in Australia.

539
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:35,255
Its a very good venture.

540
00:43:35,415 --> 00:43:42,135
Now this Ganesha has appeared in Australia is as Uluru,

541
00:43:42,295 --> 00:43:46,954
is a very big mountain which looks like Shri Ganesha.

542
00:43:47,114 --> 00:43:52,033
It has also a very big trunk, going down.

543
00:43:52,193 --> 00:43:56,295
Vibrations itself will prove that it is Shri Ganesha,

544
00:43:56,455 --> 00:43:57,695
from the mother earth.

545
00:43:57,855 --> 00:44:01,615
He has appeared in many places, Shri Ganesha not only there.

546
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:08,935
But there I felt is really the source, source of vibrations.

547
00:44:09,095 --> 00:44:10,731
That’s what it is.

548
00:44:10,891 --> 00:44:15,571
And in Australia I thank him that because of him only

549
00:44:15,731 --> 00:44:19,295
Sahaja Yoga has worked so well and so easily,

550
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:21,796
and Government also has never troubled us

551
00:44:21,956 --> 00:44:24,411
or there has been no problem with them.

552
00:44:24,571 --> 00:44:27,116
I don’t know what’s this helping them

553
00:44:27,276 --> 00:44:31,636
but perhaps it is Shri Ganesha as Uluru

554
00:44:31,796 --> 00:44:36,085
which is protecting Sahaja Yoga there and is growing so much.

555
00:44:36,245 --> 00:44:40,136
In the same way every where, wherever you may be

556
00:44:40,296 --> 00:44:42,386
Shri Ganesha should be worshipped

557
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:46,790
and you will be helped out and out miraculously.

558
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,074
You will be helped, miraculously

559
00:44:49,234 --> 00:44:54,445
but first do something about our chastity which is Shri Ganesha.

560
00:44:54,643 --> 00:44:56,468
May God Bless You.
