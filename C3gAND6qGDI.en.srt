1
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,760
If you cannot enjoy in Sahaja Yoga,

2
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:14,419
then you should know that something is wrong with you.

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,013
If you cannot feel happy in Sahaja Yoga, then you must know

4
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:20,722
that there’s something definitely wrong with you.

5
00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:23,759
If you cannot enjoy the company of sahaja yogis,

6
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:27,137
then be sure something is wrong with you.

7
00:00:27,218 --> 00:00:33,593
If you cannot laugh and appreciate the greatness of God,

8
00:00:33,718 --> 00:00:36,359
then something wrong with you.

9
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:40,172
If you are still worried about negative people and their problems

10
00:00:40,297 --> 00:00:43,588
then know that there’s something wrong with you.

11
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:46,324
If you have sympathies with negative people,

12
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:49,324
then also there’s something wrong with you.

13
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:54,031
But if you have anger for negative and all that is negative

14
00:00:54,155 --> 00:01:00,342
that is against Sahaja Yoga, then you are there.

15
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:10,764
If you know how to get fun out of the so-called

16
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:13,743
discomforts, then you should know

17
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,339
you are on the right lights.

18
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:21,447
And as you start becoming discreet automatically,

19
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:24,861
you should know you are progressing well.

20
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:28,178
As you become more peaceful and your temper

21
00:01:28,277 --> 00:01:32,610
vanishes in the thin air as soon as you see somebody

22
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:38,370
attacking you, then know that you are progressing well.

23
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:46,236
As soon as you see a ordeal or a calamity falling on

24
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:52,330
the personality and you do not get worried about it,

25
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:55,478
then know that you are progressing.

26
00:01:55,569 --> 00:02:01,986
When no amount of artificiality can impress you,

27
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:05,175
then know that you are progressing.

28
00:02:05,256 --> 00:02:14,090
No amount of material well-being in others

29
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:19,050
makes you unhappy, no more unhappy,

30
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:23,041
then know that you are progressing well.

31
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:27,899
No amount of

32
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:36,732
labor or

33
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:48,899
or troubles are sufficient to become a Sahaja yogi.

34
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:53,441
Any – whatever you may try, one cannot become a Sahaja yogi,

35
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:59,503
while you have got it without any effort.

36
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:03,456
So you are something special.

37
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:07,473
So this, once you understand that you are special,

38
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,342
you will become humble about it.

39
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:17,136
Then when it happens to you that you’ve humbled down

40
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:19,842
when you see you have achieved something,

41
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:22,092
that you have some powers,

42
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:28,008
that you are emitting innocence, that you are discreet,

43
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,717
and as a result of that you become more compassion,

44
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:36,967
humbler personality, a sweeter personality,

45
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,342
then you should believe

46
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:44,592
that you are in the heart of your Mother.

47
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,491
This is what is the sign of the new Sahaja yogi now

48
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:57,051
in the new era, who has to move with new force.

49
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:04,617
Where you will grow so fast that without meditation,

50
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:07,691
you will be in meditation;

51
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:13,786
without being in My presence, you will be in My presence;

52
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:22,053
without asking, you will be blessed by your Father.

53
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:25,264
This is what you are in for;

54
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:31,406
and again I welcome you to this new era today,

55
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,975
on this great day of Sahasrara.

56
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:38,016
May God bless you all.
