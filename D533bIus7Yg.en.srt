1
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:10,949
Dr. Warren has already talked to you about
the different centers that we have within

2
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:33,259
ourselves, and you can see how beautifully
they are placed and how gradually when the

3
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:42,879
Kundalini rises, how She enlightens the innermost
core of the centers. There are three channels

4
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:59,100
in the central channel, and the innermost
channel is used by Kundalini to pierce through

5
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:10,540
for the first time. You can imagine Kundalini
to be made of many strands of energy tied

6
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,060
together just like a rope, and as the chakras
start opening more strands start getting awakened

7
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,159
and they pierce through these six centers;
but if a person after Realization just thinks

8
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,869
that he has got the Realization, then he doesn't
have to bother about it, may lose it for the

9
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:58,869
time being, for quite some time I should say,
and he'll have to work much harder to re-establish

10
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:05,109
his Self Realization.

11
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:12,109
I've seen many-a-times when we give Realization
to people they say, "Yes, we have felt it."

12
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:21,590
They did feel it, everything happens, and
then they loose it because they have not established

13
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:30,299
their Realization properly, for which luckily
in every place wherever I go I see to it that

14
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:38,599
we already have a center established, then
you can go to that center and you can learn

15
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:48,610
from them how to establish your Realization.
That is a very, very important time which

16
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,260
must be taken into consideration.

17
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:01,260
There was a lady who had cancer, she was cured
of her cancer, she was perfectly all right

18
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:09,049
and she went back to her family, she was doing
very well, and after some time - a year or

19
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:20,829
so - she came back with another disease of
a very serious nature.

20
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,689
So I asked her, "How is it that you are cured
of cancer, now you get another disease? Did

21
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:29,370
you do anything about it?"

22
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:35,739
"No, Mother, I went back from here, everybody
says, 'You are looking very fine.' They are

23
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:41,739
all right, they were all quite surprised how
I was cured, and I never bothered to do anything

24
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,329
about it."

25
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:50,329
So she got another trouble. You go on like
this, you cure one thing then you again cure

26
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:58,469
another thing. Like little children, you clean
them, then again they get out and soil their

27
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:04,840
clothes, again they are back in the bathroom,
then again you clean them, again they do the

28
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,840
same thing. So you have to mature, after Realization
you must in all wisdom and sensible behavior,

29
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:20,220
you must mature of it, otherwise it is a big
headache to Me and big headache to you, and

30
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:27,220
you can be quite lost also with it, because
if a seed is half-sprouted it is of no use

31
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,560
at all.

32
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,560
So if you want that you should really have
the complete bliss of Self Realization, you

33
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:44,990
have to become a little serious person about
it. Shallow temperament is not going to help

34
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:50,220
you, or looking at it as if like another guru
shopping business it is not going to work

35
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,900
out. You have to work to see that you establish
yourself, till you have established you are

36
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,660
not to work on other people but once you are
established you can start working on other

37
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:09,660
people, giving them Realization. There is
no need then for you to bother that you will

38
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:16,780
catch from others, or anything; but before
that you should not try to help others. First

39
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:23,440
help yourself, selfishness to begin with.
Unless and until you are all right and you

40
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,440
know all the methods of protecting yourself,
you are not to indulge into Sahaja Yoga practices

41
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:39,410
which helps others. But when you become an
expert, when you have an expertise then you

42
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,360
should do it. Like a mechanic who doesn't
know how to repair a car, they spoil it more.

43
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,130
So better become an expert for which you don't
have to pay anything, you don't have to do

44
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:56,400
much about it but only to understand how you
have to move the Kundalini within you, how

45
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,400
you have to establish it back, what problems
you have and how you have to cure. You will

46
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,180
be surprised you won't be aware of problems
that you have.

47
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,940
One gentleman came and told Me, "Mother everyone
is coming and asking me, 'what about your

48
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,270
father, what's the problem?'"

49
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,270
I said, "Everybody said the same?"

50
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,560
He said, "Yes."

51
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,290
I said, "I also want to know, what about your
father?"

52
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:30,290
He said, "My father died very early in life,
and I always had a feeling that I had no father."

53
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:36,690
That can be cured, and he developed asthma
with it, so everybody knows, those who know

54
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:43,690
one thing that is the truth about you. All
of them will say the same thing, even if it

55
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,330
is a small child, he will also come and ask
you that "Is your father all right?" Because

56
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,960
if he knows that this center, this center
on the right hand side means the father. So

57
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,960
he will also say the same and then he will
come and ask you, "what about your father?"

58
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:09,270
It is so remarkable sometimes the way people
see these things that they can't believe it,

59
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:15,370
but this is nothing, what you get is just
a wee bit of it.

60
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:22,370
But as Kundalini rises, on every center you
start getting the light of that center. At

61
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,680
the first center you get back your innocence,
your eyes become innocent, your behavior becomes

62
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:39,550
innocent, you are not filled with lust and
greed, you don't look at things with lust

63
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:46,400
and greed, but you look at things with innocence,
which is a very big thing that people have

64
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,400
lost and that you get back and such a person
develops many qualities. One of them is that

65
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:00,810
such a person is full of fragrance, such a
person has a tremendous gravity, tremendous

66
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:11,420
gravity, and such a person has tremendous
dynamism, and attraction is a bad word so

67
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,720
I don't want to use it, but magnetical.

68
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,720
His magnets is awakened within him, this is
the center of your magnet of the earth. Such

69
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:32,770
a person develops a tremendous sense of roots
and sense of direction, you place him anywhere

70
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:40,270
he will know where to go. Like birds, you
place birds anywhere they know which side

71
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:47,270
is north, south, east, west. In the same way
you also develop your lost innocence and your

72
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:55,420
magnet within you by which you have proper
direction; but the highest of all you develop

73
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:02,420
the proper direction to wisdom which is the
wise thing to do. You just don't do stupid

74
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,860
things, you just don't do, even if you ever
try to do it, you will not do it, because

75
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:16,860
you know it is so stupid, just you don't do
it. I mean it is so simple to be wise than

76
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:25,260
to be stupid, because if you have to be stupid
you have to go out of the way to be stupid

77
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:32,260
and idiotic; but if you want to be normal
and wise is the easiest thing to do. But what

78
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:39,840
people do is to do things that would make
them more and more stupid, nonsensical, because

79
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:49,710
also some people told Me they do it, the reason
being they think they have a nuisance value.

80
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,750
Like in London now we have one funny stuff
going on, they call it what? "Punk rock."

81
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:02,550
You see, it's a funny stuff. Now poor kids
they don't know what they are doing it, and

82
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:09,550
I think the only value of that punk rock system
is this: that they try to sort of make a nuisance

83
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,380
out of them so that people feel attracted
towards them or sort of a significance out

84
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:27,170
of them. But when you become a realized soul
you realize your significance, because you

85
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:34,170
understand you are part and parcel of the
whole and that your significance is to give

86
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,080
Realization to others, the highest of highest,
that's what you have to do now you are a saint,

87
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:49,080
and that's how the whole attitude of cheapiness,
of outward shallowness finishes and you become

88
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,800
a serene, dignified personality. This is not
possible through any sermon, any lecture,

89
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:05,080
it's only possible when the Kundalini rises
you become like a very dignified child, very

90
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,820
dignified child.

91
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,820
I've seen one beautiful painting done of Mother
Mary being taught first time. You see Her

92
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,029
as a child, She is a very dignified personality,
as a child, She is about ten years of age.

93
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:32,029
I've seen My own grandchildren who are not
very old but extremely dignified. They walk

94
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:38,510
like kings, behave like kings. In every behavior
you find there's such a dignity, they'll never

95
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,680
do something shallow, they never ask for anything,
they never weep for anything, they never cry

96
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,680
for anything, they are so dignified and they
understand it so well what is dignity is.

97
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,810
I don't have to tell them, because they are
born realized, in the same way you become,

98
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,779
nobody has to tell you that "do this, or do
that," but you understand that you must have

99
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:07,760
self-respect. This happens to you automatically,
this is actualization, nobody has to tell

100
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,910
you that "you be dignified," you just become.
I've seen people who were absolutely absurd,

101
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:18,480
even from this punk rock we got some people
and they were so changed that people could

102
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,720
not recognize them, but one thing bad has
happened with this punk rock that they put

103
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,630
some sort of dye in their head and since then
their eyes became very weak, because these

104
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:36,630
dyes I think made the optic globe covered
with some sort of a color and you can't see

105
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:43,170
properly, and the eyes became very weak and
it took some time for us to remove the effect

106
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,360
of those dyes from their head.

107
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,470
We go headlong, "what's wrong?" There is nothing
wrong in this world if it is a stupid fool,

108
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:57,360
but for a wise man there are very many things
which are absolutely wrong, and there are

109
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:04,360
very many things which are absolutely correct,
so you develop your wisdom by this first center.

110
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:12,370
Now as the Kundalini rises She enlightens
your second center which we can call as the

111
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,750
Swadishthan Chakra for the time being, though
it is the third center. But second center,

112
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:24,750
you become extremely creative, extremely creative.
I know of a gentleman who came to Me, he had

113
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,279
no job.

114
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,400
And he said, "Mother, I have no job and what
should I do?"

115
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,710
I said, "All right, what do you want to do?"

116
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,240
He said, "Whatever you say."

117
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,240
I said, "All right, why don't you become an
interior decorator?"

118
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,890
He said, "Me? I don't know what is a teak
wood, I don't know what is a rose wood, how

119
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,580
am I to become an interior decorator?"

120
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,279
I said, "You just use your vibrations."

121
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,440
And you'll be surprised he earned million
of rupees out of that profession because you

122
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:59,440
become extremely creative, your sense of creation
becomes so subtle and so beautiful that you

123
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:07,089
start understanding art at such a high level
that people don't know how, when you are not

124
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:13,620
educated in art, how you can do it. I went
to Japan once, and they were having an Ikebana

125
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,460
competition or something, so I went to see
the Ikebana class and they requested Me, "Why

126
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,330
don't you do some flower arrangements?"

127
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,630
I said, "All right, I'll do."

128
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:28,930
I did it and I got the highest marks without
knowing a word about Ikebana, just surprise

129
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:35,029
Me, I got the highest mark. I can do lots
of things which I've never done before like

130
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:40,250
architecture. I have built houses without
doing any architecture, I've done decorations

131
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:47,250
of the houses, I've done all kinds of things
without knowing how to it, because you become

132
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,330
you so creative.

133
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:54,089
Music you start understanding so much better.
There are people now in America, there's a

134
00:14:54,089 --> 00:15:00,100
girl, she had a horrible hoarse voice, absolutely
hoarse voice, and she always used to go out

135
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,339
of tune.

136
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:04,950
So I told her, "You shouldn't sing songs before
Me because it's rather funny."

137
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,050
She said, "Mother, why don't You give me a
good voice?"

138
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:13,770
I said, "You just try your Vishuddhi Chakra,
if your Vishuddhi Chakra is corrected you'll

139
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,420
be all right."

140
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:21,610
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: Why don't you sit
down.]

141
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:27,540
So the Vishuddhi Chakra was ... she tried
on Vishuddhi Chakra giving vibrations, and

142
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:34,540
she sings so melodiously now that I tell you
she can be a great singer. So the creativity,

143
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:42,459
that also is a blessing of your power of the
Goddess of learning. Boys who could not study

144
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:49,459
in the schools were absolutely duffers. Some
people brought this boy, recently I've received

145
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:50,480
a letter from him.

146
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,330
When he came to Me, his father said that "He
is going to be taken out of school because

147
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,270
he's good for nothing, he can not remember
anything, he's absolutely finished."

148
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,810
I said, "All right, doesn't matter, let him
take to Sahaja Yoga."

149
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:09,580
He got his Realization. Not only that he passed
with first class, but he got a scholarship.

150
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:16,580
Then he passed another exam, he got a scholarship.
Now he's got a very big job, at a very young

151
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,709
age. He wrote to Me, "Mother no one can believe
that a duffer like me has been so much highly

152
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:29,510
placed." All the boys who got scholarships
in Maharashtra in schools, in colleges and

153
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,550
universities are Sahaja Yogis.

154
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:39,070
It is such a tremendous force that starts
working in you, if you try to give vibrations

155
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:46,070
say to fruits or to trees or to say wheat
and such things which are very important for

156
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:58,470
life, any food, you will be amazed that the
food also grows so much more and the taste

157
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:07,000
is so good and it lasts you so longer. Like
one gentleman tried, a university professor

158
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
in agricultural college on some wheat, some
vibrations and he was amazed that when they

159
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:20,869
collected this wheat it was at least six times
more than normal, and when this wheat was

160
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:27,869
stored in a big hall like this, there were
so many other things, the rats who are always

161
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:36,580
a menace in India never touched that wheat.
They ate all the rest of it but never touched

162
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,970
the wheat.

163
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:44,970
Even the animals - the snails, even the tigers,
of course the dogs and the cats - understand

164
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,980
it much more, they understand you, they know
that you are a saint. They'll never touch

165
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,659
you, they will never trouble you. Even a tiger
sees a saint, he never attacks. You can handle

166
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:02,919
a tiger very easily; this is the power of
a saint. So you develop a tremendous capacity

167
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:09,919
of creativity. The greatest capacity you have
then is of creating a new human being out

168
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:19,220
of a ordinary human being. This is the greatest
blessing that you have, that you transform

169
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:26,220
an egg into a bird and that is the epitome,
that is the spiritual power you have, by which

170
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:33,429
you can transform the whole human race into
a new race which has this fifth dimension

171
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,700
within yourself.

172
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,999
You can start talking on science now, we have
a scientist here and he's a done his science,

173
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:48,190
he is a Doctor of Science in this and that,
in chemistry and I explained to him about

174
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:53,070
this - where is the hydrogen and oxygen and
nitrogen and all that within us and he was

175
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,360
amazed.

176
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,309
He said, "Mother, how do you know all these
things?"

177
00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:01,970
I said, "I don't know how I know, but I know.
That's what it is, you just have a look at

178
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:02,399
this."

179
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:08,340
And he was amazed how I was telling him about
spiral movement and linear movement of peptose.

180
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,489
He said that "For this I had to study so much."

181
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:14,440
I said, "For Sahaja Yog you don't have to
study." A little bit you know and immediately

182
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,639
you click the point. Now this is the second
thing that you know in your learnings, in

183
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:24,980
your education you are all right, but the
mastery of this center comes, the mastery

184
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:31,980
of this center comes when you know the pure
knowledge, the pure knowledge of handling

185
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,080
the Kundalini, the pure knowledge of Spirit,
the pure knowledge of the blessings of God,

186
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:46,100
of Ritambhara Pragya. If you know that, that
is the highest that you achieve gradually

187
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:53,100
as you grow, because when these centers starts
expanding on the sides, you start expanding

188
00:19:53,350 --> 00:20:00,350
in your personality, in your sensitivity and
in your evolutionary ascent, so that is how

189
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:05,730
you start growing from one to another to another
to another.

190
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,659
Now the third center that we have actually,
this is the second center because the third

191
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:17,659
center arises, this Swadishthana arises out
of the Nabhi, is a very, very important center,

192
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:25,899
is the center of your seeking as he has told
you. Your compete priorities change, complete

193
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:32,549
priorities change, because the joy that you
get out of Sahaja Yoga, the joy you get out

194
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:39,549
of this meditation, out of the feeling that
grows in you all the time, like a beautiful

195
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:49,129
torrential rain of joy that fills you, your
life and everybody's life, you don't care

196
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:57,669
for cheap type of entertainment. You feel,
you seek other Sahaja Yogi, you want to meet

197
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,970
another Sahaja Yogi, you don't want to meet
anybody else. If there is an actor coming,

198
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:10,029
or some big man is coming, "All right, let
him come, I'm going to see such and such person."

199
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:16,859
It is such a different personality that one
day - I will tell you how it happens - there

200
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:21,090
was a girl, a diplomat, she's a diplomat who
is a realized soul and she happened to go

201
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:26,549
to Sicily. And she was eating her food, suddenly
she felt there is some vibrations coming down,

202
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:32,119
she looked around, the other one was also
looking at her, she said, "Are you Mataji's

203
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:32,649
disciple?"

204
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:36,929
And she said, "Yes, I am Mataji's child."

205
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:43,109
They both got up and just hugged and said,
"Such joy Mother in that far-fetched place

206
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:45,609
of Sicily to find a Sahaja Yogi."

207
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:50,059
And then they stayed together and they wouldn't
go anywhere else but they said, "Now this

208
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:55,100
is the enjoyment." Just the company of a Sahaja
Yogi is such an enjoyment.

209
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,769
I've seen these people when they go to India,
the people are not so rich, poor people - they

210
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:04,489
have little, little huts - but when they go
they go there, you should see the love, the

211
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:10,690
rapport, and that makes Me so happy, so happy,
the way they love each other, the way they

212
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:17,690
understand each other, the way they help each
other and the only the company, for the first

213
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:25,539
time they start enjoying. We were once in
a hotel staying in Calcutta and with two Sahaja

214
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,730
Yogi with Me. They were in the other room,
quite far away, they could not get a room

215
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:35,739
close to Me, and one gentleman came for his
Realization, he came to My feet, when he got

216
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:40,940
his Realization it was a tremendous happening
and they came rushing from there.

217
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,609
I said, "What happened?"

218
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:46,779
They said, "We felt the vibrations, we felt
the vibrations from there, Mother, so we have

219
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:49,159
come to receive the vibrations."

220
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:56,159
And they came and they felt the vibrations.
So this man was so great that his vibrations

221
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:02,299
attracted them and they came down. They were
just enjoying that as if they were enjoying

222
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:08,940
a big flower with lots of fragrance. What
vibrations, what vibrations! The fellow got

223
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:15,940
up and said, "Very nice. They are enjoying
my vibrations. Now I'm going to enjoy your

224
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:17,899
vibrations."

225
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:24,899
For the first time you start enjoying your
fellow man because everyone is a beautiful

226
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:30,889
personality, a glorious, fragrant, joyful
personality; but because you cannot feel the

227
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:36,100
other person, and because the other person
does not emit, you are all the time quarreling.

228
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,929
Even husband-wife quarreling, father-mother
quarreling, this one quarreling, that quarreling.

229
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:45,509
In Sahaja Yoga there is hardly any time for
people to quarrel. The other day I had a lady

230
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:50,379
who came to see Me, and she was trying to
put her point and there were about five-six

231
00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:55,789
Sahaja Yogis, and everybody was putting the
same point and she was amazed.

232
00:23:55,789 --> 00:24:02,259
She said, "I've never seen such concord, such
friendship, such understanding, all of them

233
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:07,279
supporting each other, nobody is cutting anyone."

234
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:13,850
Such a society has to develop. It's such a
nourishing, soothing, invigorating society,

235
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:20,850
and you forget about getting bored, boredom
goes out of life, you never get bored, you

236
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:26,499
enjoy yourself or you enjoy the company of
Sahaja Yogis and it is very different level

237
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:32,669
that you come of - that is what, that land
you have to reach within yourself.

238
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:39,669
Now the greatest thing that happens as a result
of this center seeking, that you start seeking

239
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:46,989
other seekers, you try to find out "where
is the seeker?" If you hear somebody is a

240
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:52,129
seeker, you go and see. If you hear about
someone that some people are lost there, they

241
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:57,559
were seekers, but they went there lost, you
all rush there. It is like a person who is

242
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:04,559
like a, what you call a guard on the seashore
you know, there are guards kept for salvaging

243
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:13,629
people, and that is how you become. You suddenly
see somebody sinking, you just go. In Bombay

244
00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:17,879
there was a case they announce that "there's
a lady who is going to die, if somebody can

245
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:23,700
come and help her, it will be a great thing."
They all rushed there; they saved her.

246
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,570
Now the interests changes completely, and
you start really helping people and not feeling

247
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:36,570
that you are helping them, not at all. But
the surrounding portion of that, which is

248
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,629
the void, is the best, which is affected by
your awakening, that you become the virtue

249
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:50,629
itself. Nobody has to tell you that you be
virtuous, when you are awakened you become

250
00:25:54,100 --> 00:26:01,100
a virtuous person, you enjoy your virtues,
you enjoy being good, you enjoy being nice,

251
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:11,779
you really enjoy it. And that enjoyment comes
to you as a blessing because the virtue itself

252
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:19,269
is so strengthening, so powerful that anyone
who is harmed or troubled or tortured or put

253
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:29,979
down, you stand up, you are not afraid of
anyone, you are not afraid of any one of them.

254
00:26:31,629 --> 00:26:38,629
Now about these people who have been troubling
you as fake gurus, I told about them in 1970.

255
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:45,600
I'm just a lady and single-handed I told them
who these people are, how they are going to

256
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,529
loot you, and what they are going to do; but
in this country nobody can think of one genuine

257
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:58,529
person who could be really genuine. It was
the problem that time, but with this awakening

258
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:04,679
within you of the virtuous nature, you just
know what is virtue and what is not virtue.

259
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:11,049
I don't have to tell you; I don't say "don't
do this, don't do that." I never say that,

260
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:18,049
it just happens, because when the virtue starts
developing, the vibrations improve and you

261
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:25,119
feel extremely joyous. We have lost our virtues
because there is no joy out of it, no reward.

262
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,940
If somebody is honest, he has to suffer; if
somebody's good, he has to suffer; is somebody's

263
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,639
kind, he thinks he has to suffer; but after
getting Realization you are rewarded for your

264
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:41,129
virtues.

265
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:48,129
You are amazed how you are paid for it, it's
so surprising, like once there was a lady

266
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:54,080
who came to see Me, she was a refugee, and
I had a big house.

267
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,389
So I said, "All right come and stay with Me."

268
00:27:56,389 --> 00:28:00,239
So My husband, My brother they came, they
said, "What's this? You don't know her, who

269
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:05,739
she is, her husband, whether he is her husband
or not, just given her two rooms. It's not

270
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:06,210
good!"

271
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,059
I said, "Let it be, doesn't matter. I know
for nothing is going to happen, let her be

272
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:09,289
here."

273
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:12,809
So they wouldn't also go against Me. They
said, "All right, if you say so."

274
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:17,690
This lady stayed for ten days and went away.
Then she become a very well-known actress

275
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,470
in India, I didn't know she was the same lady,
but somebody told Me that she is the same

276
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,859
lady. I said, "Maybe."

277
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:28,049
Then one day you see, they wanted to make
a film for our Sahaja Yoga, so they said,

278
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:32,119
"We can ask this lady to act, because she
is a good actress."

279
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:36,499
I said, "All right, you can go ask but don't
tell her I am here, otherwise she will have

280
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:39,499
no choice. I will not go and see her. You
just ask her."

281
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:42,940
They went and ask her, they said, "Will you
be actress?" and all that.

282
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,809
She said, "I'll try." This, that she was saying.

283
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:48,720
But on the day on when they were going to
open the film I went there, she saw Me, she

284
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,099
was so amazed, she said, "Oh God, You are
the One, You are the One Who is sponsoring

285
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,379
this, Oh, I'll give my life for Her!" She
just came forward, she said, "Have anything

286
00:28:57,379 --> 00:29:02,960
you like, I have nothing to say, I am so sorry
that you never told me that She's there."

287
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,470
Thousand times more she rewarded a little
thing I did for her.

288
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:15,759
No more cheating, no more troubling, you become
a wonderful person and so many people become

289
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,769
your friends in this world. Your have to just
tell you are coming, there will hundred people

290
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:25,489
at the airport to receive you. There will
be so many friends all over the world for

291
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:31,149
you, you will be amazed. It's such a tremendous
thing happens, because now you all are awakened

292
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:37,399
in that Primordial Being and you have become
one with each other. You can feel it, that

293
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:42,149
oneness, that unison that we are all not only
human beings but we are yogis, we are super

294
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:48,419
human beings, and we have to look after the
whole world. That feeling of compassion is

295
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:55,419
so overwhelming that all little, little stupid
things just fall off, there's no place for

296
00:29:56,109 --> 00:29:59,419
that. This actually happens and has happened
with many.

297
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:04,200
Dr. Warren, whom you have seen here, can tell
you as I have told you lots of stories, but

298
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,940
there are many, some of them were so hot tempered,
some of them were so quarrelsome, some them

299
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,509
used to fight so much in the beginning that
I thought, "How are they going to be all right?"

300
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:21,379
But today I find them as great friends and
very great yogis. So this is the center where

301
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:28,379
your religion is awakened. And what is a religion?
Word comes from "religo," in Sanskrit it means

302
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:34,340
dharma, "Dhariyatisa Dharma," the sustenance,
your sustenance, your valances is your religion.

303
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:40,149
As every atom, carbon has four valances, and
in the same way you have ten valances, these

304
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:47,149
are the ten commandments that were told to
you and you become that, you just become.

305
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:53,830
I don't have to tell you as commandments but
they become your beautiful ornaments within

306
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:59,369
yourself. This happens automatically, so spontaneously
you become that.

307
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:05,169
A bishop came to see Me the other day, he
is a relation of Mine, My brother. He came

308
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:10,960
to see Me, and he was rather adamant and little
angry when he came to see Me because he thought,

309
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,450
"Why am I trying to do this kind of thing?"

310
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,440
But when he saw the Sahaja Yogis he said,
"I'm amazed, you know, I've been giving lectures

311
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:24,649
in the church for years together, but I could
not achieve anything. How have You transformed

312
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:30,669
these people? The drug addicts have suddenly
become such good people that they have given

313
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:35,960
up drugs, alcoholics have given up alcohol.
How is it without telling them anything?"

314
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:41,700
I said, "Everything is within them. As soon
as the light comes you can see everything.

315
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,499
You know that this is on your way, this is
against your progress, this is anti-life,

316
00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:49,769
you just give up. Only thing you have to have
the light within you."

317
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:56,409
So he himself was surprised at this and then
he said, "Really, that should be done, is

318
00:31:56,409 --> 00:31:57,129
to transform them."

319
00:31:57,129 --> 00:32:02,259
But I said, "You do not transform them by
giving them big sermons, you transform them

320
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:09,259
by giving them the real second birth, real
baptism." And I must say that Calvinist, of

321
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:15,119
all the persons, Calvinist in Geneva have
accepted Me and they think that this is the

322
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,019
only way they can transform you.

323
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:24,019
You will be amazed the Calvinist of all the
persons who are such I should say one-sided

324
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:31,109
people, they have accepted to see the result
of everybody who is open-minded person, who

325
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:36,879
thinks for the good of others and not for
money-making and for selfish ends. We'll see

326
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:42,659
one day that this is the way it has to be.
God has given us this power, we have got a

327
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:47,899
Spirit within us, we should try to awaken
that and we should accept it, not because

328
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:54,590
I'm doing it, you can do it also. So this
thing happens to you with this chakra.

329
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,570
Now with the another chakra on top, that is
one - as he has told the diseases, I'm telling

330
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:05,690
you the positive side of it - when this chakra
is caught up he must have told you, you develop

331
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:12,690
breast cancer and all that. But when it is
awakened, you get all the security of the

332
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:20,059
world, you are never insecure, you are never
bothered, you have no fear of anyone. You

333
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:26,269
do not have to suggest yourself that "you
should not have fear or anything," you just

334
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:33,269
become fearless, there is no nothing like
fear, there's no reaction to any threat or

335
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:39,429
anything. Like the gentleman who came here,
just to beat Me now, I was just looking at

336
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:44,099
the drum, and the fellow was getting frightened
of Me, he was going backwards, backwards,

337
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:50,099
he would not come forward. But you don't develop
any fear of at all about anyone, because you

338
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:56,649
are standing on truth, like Christ. At the
time when He was challenged, you must know

339
00:33:56,649 --> 00:34:03,649
when Mary Magdalene was beaten up, He stood
up. He had nothing to do with the prostitute,

340
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,849
such a virtuous man, He was virtue personified,
He stood up, He said, "Those who have not

341
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:14,240
committed any sin, can throw a stone at Me."
He was sure nobody can do it because He was

342
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,569
an authority of virtue.

343
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:22,569
I, as I told you, I am just a woman and I
spoke openly with the names of these people

344
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:29,000
and told of what they are going to do, and
how they are going to possess you. And people

345
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,720
came, they were frightened, they said, "What
are You doing?"

346
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:38,720
So you get rid of all your fear, but you do
not dominate anyone, you love, in your love

347
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:46,349
you are secured. It is not by domination but
the security that you are love, you are compassion.

348
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:56,950
And the power of love is the highest of all,
that you stand in complete peace and bliss.

349
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,680
This happens to you when the central thing
comes up. There are many other things happen,

350
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,099
you can become a poet, I mean so many things
happen with this, because you become such

351
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:15,099
a compassion, such a compassion. And when
this compassion starts working you are given

352
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:18,339
all the help that is needed.

353
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:24,490
Then the another chakra - I am going a little
fast because after all you understand that

354
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:30,720
there isn't much time today, I've been speaking,
and speaking every day, it's a marathon race

355
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:37,720
for Me, so I'll try to make it short now - it's
the Vishuddhi Chakra as he told you is very

356
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:45,440
important, this is America. Vishuddhi Chakra
is America in the Universe. America is the

357
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:56,010
Vishuddhi Chakra and the star is the Saturn.
There are seventeen of them, sixteen is the

358
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,849
planet moving round, there are sixteen centers
there and the seventeenth is the Vishuddhi

359
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:11,849
itself. Is a very important thing that this
center is America, so America has the responsibility

360
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:20,400
of transformation. They have to take up the
responsibility of transforming the whole world.

361
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:29,210
Instead of that they themselves are getting
ruined, they are killing themselves. There

362
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:36,980
is no fear from outside I tell you, we are
going to be ruined from inside. What a responsibility

363
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,760
you have and what we are doing you should
see to that. That's why so many seekers are

364
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:51,760
born here, but they do not feel the responsibility
of transformation. They will, one day it will

365
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:01,480
come, they will have to feel it, once they
are awakened I'm sure they will feel that

366
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,200
responsibility.

367
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:09,200
This very important center as he must have
told you, by the virtue of this on the gross

368
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:19,220
we develop a face which is very relaxed and
attractive and good looking. We develop eyes

369
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:29,020
which are full of compassion; we develop a
face which is innocent, which is very smooth

370
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:40,049
and which has got a capacity to express its
feeling. The smallest of feelings can be expressed

371
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:48,230
through this center. It looks after your nose,
yours ears, everything improves with this.

372
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:55,230
You develop - now I can't hear anything if
a non-Sahaja Yogi speaks to Me. It is a very

373
00:37:55,589 --> 00:38:00,900
funny thing, unless and until that person
is very close I just can't hear what he is

374
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:06,670
saying, to Me, it is all what you call "blah,
blah, blah." But a Sahaja Yogi, if he speaks

375
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:09,319
to Me I can hear very well.

376
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:16,319
The whole thing changes, the whole sensitivity
changes, you start understanding what music

377
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:25,260
is good for your Spirit; you start understanding
what is good for your eyes to see, because

378
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:33,480
you don't want like to see that is something
that is horrid, you just don't enjoy it. You

379
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,109
feel like vomiting - you see something horrid,
you just feel like vomiting. You become so

380
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:42,150
sensitive you can't imagine, to virtue and
to goodness.

381
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:48,730
Automatically it happens to you, I don't have
to tell you. I've seen people have changed

382
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:55,700
overnight. The whole idea is that the light
has to be brought in for you to see for yourself,

383
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:01,359
and when it happens you'll be amazed, you
become such a different, wonderful person.

384
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:08,359
There's everyone in America has Abraham Lincoln
within them, which has to be just awakened

385
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:15,630
and you'll find that that great personality
can be shown in you, when it happens to you.

386
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:22,710
It has to happen to all of you to feel that
greatness that lies hidden within.

387
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:30,270
I cannot elaborately tell you about Vishuddhi
Chakra what they call the Krishna consciousness,

388
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:36,480
but not this Krishna consciousness which has
made people actual beggars, they are begging

389
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,760
on the streets. You go in India in the villages,
about they were going to beat these people.

390
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,799
They thought they are Krishna consciousness,
they wouldn't get places in the hotels because

391
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:49,250
they thought they are Krishna consciousness,
because these people were lost, they had no

392
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:54,470
money left with them. Now they are begging
in India, imagine. How can we afford to have

393
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:58,869
these beggars there? They have no money with
them, they can not come back, they don't know

394
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:05,869
what to do with them, so many you will find
in the villages just begging. So this kind

395
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:13,579
of thing that - imagine a person who is being
blessed by Shri Krishna Who is the Deity on

396
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,369
this center, should beg!

397
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:25,329
He's the One Who is the giver of complete
wealth, why should we beg? This is the thing

398
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:31,420
they don't understand, just the opposite of
what they are suppose to be. There are lots

399
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:37,690
of stories of Krishna how He blessed people
with wealth. It is to be seen sometimes, if

400
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:42,869
you have time, I may have time then we might
be able to see all those beautiful things

401
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:45,440
that He did.

402
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:52,440
So the other chakra is important, is the Chakra
of Christ. This center is very important because

403
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:58,980
this is the gate through this you have to
pass to your destination which is the limbic

404
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:05,010
area. So Christ is the gate, many people are
shouting, "it's only He can save." Where is

405
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,279
He now? Is He here? When He was living, they
talked of Ibrahim, when He came then they

406
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:15,279
said, "You are not the One. It was Moses.
You are not the One."

407
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:22,210
They denied Him, defied Him. Now when He's
dead, then we think, "It is Christ." Now I

408
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:27,190
have come, He's talked about Me, if you read
Bible you'll find He's talked about Me very

409
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:32,839
clearly there and I have to do My job and
I have come. You are going to say that it

410
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:39,510
was Christ Who has to do it. If Christ could
do it, why did He say that "I'm going to send

411
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:43,349
you a comforter"? He talked of future, didn't
He? Why did He say such a thing? We should

412
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:47,839
find out why did He say that "I will send
you the Holy Ghost and the Comforter and the

413
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,839
Redeemer and a Counselor"? Why did He say
that? Why not look forward to that? Because

414
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:58,410
we are today after Christ. People don't want
to see this point, they want to depend on

415
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:02,339
Christ because He's in their pocket, they
can use Him the way they like.

416
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:09,339
When He has talked, He has said, "Why not
see the point?" If this is what Christ is,

417
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:17,510
then it is such a bad thing because people
say, "Christ was no good." They say, "What

418
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:22,200
has Christ given us?" Christians nations,
what have they done, what have they achieved?

419
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:29,200
It's a bad name to Him if you do not see completion
of His work. I'm here to complete His work

420
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:38,589
and when you do not complete His work, His
half-work done in a very half-way will bring

421
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,710
bad name to Him.

422
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:44,890
Why not people who claim about Christ understand
that what others have to say about it? If

423
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:48,730
you want to know about Christians, go and
ask the Jews; and if you want to know about

424
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:53,319
the Jews, go and ask the Muslims; and if you
want to know about the Muslims, go and ask

425
00:42:53,319 --> 00:43:00,319
the Hindus. There are all in a doldrum. Nobody
has any understanding that they are worshiping

426
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,960
or they are admiring or advocating a flower
which belongs to one tree of life. They have

427
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:15,109
all plucked those flowers, "This is mine,
this is mine, in my pocket," and fighting.

428
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:22,109
If religion means fighting and quarreling,
it is not a religion at all. If it is integration,

429
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:24,960
then it is a religion.

430
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:31,019
In Sahaja Yoga you'll find that they are all
together. Christ has said, very clearly, "Those

431
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:38,019
who are not against Me are with Me." Who are
those people? Try to find out. For that you

432
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,650
have to little bit go out of Bible. In the
Bible how much do you have Christ there, for

433
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:50,549
three years? Nobody allowed Him to live for
three years, and if they could, they would

434
00:43:50,549 --> 00:43:52,260
also kill Me.

435
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:58,359
Not easy, He wanted to play the drama, otherwise
He would have finished all of them, in no

436
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:05,359
time. So He has said that "You are to be resurrected
first, and then that's how you will be judged."

437
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:13,119
And the Day of Judgment is today, this is
the Day of Judgment, that's why you are confused,

438
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,519
this is the Day of Judgment where you will
be judged and how are you going to be judged?

439
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:22,380
Through your Kundalini. Your Kundalini is
going to be awakened and you'll be judged

440
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:28,779
where you are. That's what it is, and those
who will be calling Me, "Christ, Christ" I

441
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:34,680
will not look at them, that's what it is.
By calling Him "Christ, Christ" you do not

442
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:41,400
become Christians, you have to get your Realization,
your baptism in the actual sense.

443
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,289
It has to be an actualization. I'm telling
you that if you miss the point, you have missed

444
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:53,289
it for ever and ever. Be careful on that point.
It's very important. Don't run after things

445
00:44:54,359 --> 00:45:01,359
which have no meaning to your consciousness.
Try to raise yourself up to this point and

446
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:07,510
understand that the time has come for you
to transform, this is the time of your judgment

447
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:13,730
and you have to get to it in a very big way.
The shallow things and all this will be finished.

448
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:20,410
What is America or what is any country in
the eyes of God? Nothing. If they do not take

449
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:27,410
to His ways, all will be treated like waste,
thoroughly waste, it's a wasteland. But if

450
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:34,869
you rise, thousands and thousands and millions
and millions can be saved. Try to rise, try

451
00:45:36,049 --> 00:45:41,220
to understand your own responsibilities, that
is very important.

452
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:48,220
Today is the last day and the last center
which is the Sahasrara, is the integration,

453
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:55,970
integration of your being, of physical, mental,
emotional being, it takes place. Is integration

454
00:45:56,609 --> 00:46:02,769
of all the Deities, of all the Prophets, all
the great works that they have done, integration

455
00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:09,769
of all the scriptures, everything takes places
when this Sahasrara is opened out, when you

456
00:46:09,859 --> 00:46:11,500
become the Spirit.

457
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:16,589
This is a much more difficult job, I know,
because if you don't have to transform people

458
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:23,150
it is very easy to talk about it and get away.
But I have to transform, not only transform

459
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:30,150
but you have to become, you cannot become
a Sahaji Yogi by paying Me, by saying things,

460
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:36,170
by arguing, by showing up, you can only become
Sahaji Yogi by going within yourself, face

461
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:43,170
up to it, see for yourself. I am here to help
you in every way possible. Whatever is possible

462
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,039
we'll try to do it, but you all should also
understand your responsibility.

463
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:56,599
It is not a joke now, it's no more a joke.
It's not like Sunday morning you get up and

464
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:02,220
go to church, or Monday morning you go somewhere
else in the temple, and Tuesday morning you

465
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:09,220
go to see Siddhivinayaka [Temple of Shri Ganesha
- SG] and another day you go to a mosque.

466
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:14,140
It is not like that. It is a very serious
thing which we must understand. We are at

467
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:20,130
the brink of destruction, be careful about
it. We must do things so that the blessings

468
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:25,789
of God comes to upon us and that we are saved.
It is a very serious thing, and the responsibility

469
00:47:25,789 --> 00:47:32,789
is much more on all the people who are getting
Realization, so do not treat it lightly. You

470
00:47:34,049 --> 00:47:35,369
all, I hope, will take it seriously.

471
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:42,369
Thank God there is a nice seminar we are having
after this for three days, you can come down

472
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:48,859
there, they have charged you very little,
we don't have to make any profit of out you,

473
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:53,970
the only profit I can make is that you get
your profits, that's all. So please take it

474
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:59,710
up seriously, work it out seriously, and I
tell you, out of you will come out those people

475
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:06,079
who will build that foundations of that construction
which is going to come. Please don't waste

476
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,609
your time in useless things, get to it.

477
00:48:09,609 --> 00:48:16,589
Any one of you can do it. I bless you with
My whole heart and know that I love you very

478
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:22,069
much. If you have any problems, you can write
to Me, but don't write to Me about your family

479
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:26,150
problems and this and that, it's a headache
to Me, there is no need to write. Of course

480
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:30,450
I'm a mother, if you have problems you can
write but some people write ten pages saying,

481
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:35,630
"my wife is fighting me." It's bit too much.
You should write to Me about the problems

482
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:42,630
which concern the whole country, concern the
whole world. Widen yourself and that's how,

483
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:48,000
though you may think that you are very unassuming
simple people, you are the ones who are going

484
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,869
to be, not those who are successful, they
are blinded by their success; not those who

485
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:56,970
are rich, they are not going to enter into
the Kingdom of God; not those who have a big

486
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:03,970
name, no. It's you, you are going to enter
into the Kingdom 

487
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:30,940
of God.

488
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:41,079
May God bless you.

489
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:21,400
[Self Realization]

490
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:41,559
Now, all 
the angels have 

491
00:51:23,319 --> 00:51:30,319
a seat, now, put your hands towards Me like
this, and close your eyes, the vibrations

492
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:21,869
are so much today, nothing to do. Just so
much vibrations tonight, it's tremendous.

493
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:28,869
Just close your eyes, you'll feel the cool
breeze, most of you, close your eyes please.

494
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:47,900
You just put your right hand on the head and
see if there is a cool breeze coming out,

495
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:54,900
little higher, on top of your head.

496
00:52:56,119 --> 00:53:03,119
Hmm, it's there. Now put your right hand towards
Me and put the left hand and see, little higher,

497
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:13,700
about six inches higher, six inches higher,
change over, again, now put your hands up

498
00:53:36,809 --> 00:53:43,809
like this absolutely, close the eyes and ask,
"Is this the breeze of the Holy Ghost" or

499
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:58,140
ask the question "Mother, are You the Holy
Ghost?

500
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:12,630
You feel the cool breeze? Good, it's tremendous
today. May God bless you all.

501
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:24,210
Those who have not felt any cool breeze, please
raise your hands. One, two and three. Are

502
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:36,269
keeping all right? You are not well? All right,
doesn't matter, if you are not well maybe

503
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:47,410
you may not feel today but you'll get well
and then you'll feel it, so it doesn't matter.

504
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:52,650
There's one or two persons who have not felt
it, it's so tremendous today, May God bless

505
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:53,630
you.

506
00:54:53,630 --> 00:55:00,630
You may give your addresses to these people,
let them know where you are, also you can

507
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:08,180
take address for the seminar, if you want
to come, they are going to arrange a transport

508
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:14,650
for you to go to Santa Cruz. Thank you very
much.

509
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:21,650
I say goodbye to you, after a year I'll definitely
will come to Los Angeles again, those who

510
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:27,089
haven't cool breeze should keep their hands
raised. These boys will come and see you.

511
00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:30,670
All right, those people who haven't got it,
please keep your hands slightly raised so

512
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:34,769
some people will come and see you, little
higher so that they'll come and see you. Here

513
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:35,509
just have a look.

514
00:55:35,509 --> 00:55:42,509
Man in the Audience: I didn't hear Your last
question. I didn't understand what You asked

515
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:47,140
about the Holy Ghost.

516
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:52,680
Shri Mataji: Just to know that I am the Holy
Ghost.

517
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,349
Man in the Audience: You are Holy Ghost?

518
00:55:54,349 --> 00:55:55,190
Shri Mataji: Yes. Otherwise how will you recognize?

519
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:55,920
Man in the Audience: The Bible says that God
is the Holy Ghost.

520
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:01,259
Shri Mataji: Bible never says that. You don't
understand that. You don't teach Me Bible.

521
00:56:01,259 --> 00:56:08,259
[Man keeps interrupting Shri Mataji] It doesn't
say. You don't tell Me. You have no knowledge.

522
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:19,599
Don't disturb others. If you are such a good
person you ...
