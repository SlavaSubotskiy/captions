1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,060
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:14,030
as a very great personality.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,240
And you know why He came on this earth –

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:30,120
to establish this is the new form of, not Virat, not Virata,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,010
but a form by which this country became so prosperous.

6
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:55,030
And by His advent only He created a beautiful mentality

7
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:04,200
among the people how to develop this country with Dharma.

8
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,140
And you had very great leaders

9
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,090
who followed Him

10
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,010
and who worshipped Him in a way,

11
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,040
and created a new world of this America.

12
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,170
But unfortunately as the time passed on,

13
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:42,220
His form vanished from the minds of the people.

14
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,130
The reason was, Krishna was represented here

15
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,010
by very, very wrong type of people who had no idea

16
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,100
about Shri Krishna:

17
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:08,140
that He was a great master of wealth,

18
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:16,040
that He knew how to use the wealth and how to create

19
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,170
the wealth with dharma, not with adharma.

20
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,180
They all forgot about it completely

21
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,070
and gradually started using maneuvering powers,

22
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:41,100
all kinds of, all kinds of adharmic things – cheating, grabbing

23
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:50,000
money, spending their money in absolutely useless things.

24
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,120
He is Kubera. He doesn’t need any money, of course,

25
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,210
He achieves money;

26
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,010
and not only that,

27
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,020
He is living, He lived in money.

28
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,160
They said that He created a golden house for Him,

29
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,080
absolutely made with gold in Dwarika,

30
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,120
but it submerged in the water,

31
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:33,100
in the sea, and nobody believed that it is true.

32
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,100
But now they have found out His house under the water,

33
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,030
very deep waters,

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,030
so all their conjecture about Him was wrong, all false;

35
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,200
that He was definitely a man who made lots of money

36
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,200
by dharma.

37
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,050
Also He was a son of a king, and He built this Dwarika

38
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,040
out of gold.

39
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,130
It is still there and people have found it,

40
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,160
but under the sea.

41
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:17,000
Thousands of years have passed, but still existed.

42
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,200
Only because perhaps we belong to Shri Krishna,

43
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,070
it is still existing.

44
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,090
That’s what it is, because He was the one

45
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,100
who was for satya first – truth.

46
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:40,150
He was for truth, and He worked out everything

47
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,210
on the principle of truth.

48
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,040
Whatever was not truth, He tried to finish it off.

49
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:56,080
Whatever was destructive, He tried to remove that;

50
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,200
and He established Himself through truth only, truth only.

51
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,190
He’s the one who represent the truth, absolute truth,

52
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,030
and how the truth can prevail in everything.

53
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,000
I’m just the opposite of Him because I don’t understand

54
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,070
money at all,

55
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,000
but He’s looking after that part in My life.

56
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,160
I’m so hopelessly bad –

57
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,240
I don’t understand banking, I don’t understand money,

58
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,070
I can’t even count money. Now what can you say to that?

59
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,240
But He’s there to look after,

60
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,230
and I've never a dearth of money, never a dearth of any

61
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,020
wealth, it’s all full of it.

62
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,090
Also it comes through your sense of satisfaction.

63
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,180
If you have that sense of satisfaction,

64
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,230
you don’t look for money.

65
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,160
What happened in your country that some people got money.

66
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,030
If you got little money, then you get the taste of money.

67
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,040
They’re not satisfied people.

68
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,200
So like mad they went on spending on nonsensical things.

69
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,180
It is something very much human.

70
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,230
After your human evolution,

71
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,060
after you have reached a certain state of enlightenment,

72
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:50,240
then all these demeaning things like greed

73
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,090
all disappear from your character.

74
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,180
You don’t have that greed in you anymore

75
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,010
and you become extremely a satisfied person.

76
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,230
To you money is there, all right, but it’s not so important.

77
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:19,130
It is just that you think don’t need it, and you’ll get it –

78
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,240
all done by Shri Krishna all over, can you imagine?

79
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,120
He’s doing all this, looking after you

80
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,240
and helping you with money.

81
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,210
We started Sahaja Yoga without a single pai.

82
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,100
I don’t, never had any problem.

83
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:47,090
So one thing, as Kubera He’s the supplier of wealth.

84
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:51,020
He looks after people who don’t have money.

85
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,060
He gives money to people who stand by truth,

86
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,150
who enjoy the life of truth.

87
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:15,180
It is His work that people enjoy wealth, otherwise they don’t.

88
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,140
They have this much, they want to have more;

89
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,150
that means they don’t enjoy the wealth.

90
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,040
They have a little, they want to get much more. Why?

91
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,090
Because they are not enjoying whatever they have.

92
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,150
But after Self-realization you will see that you enjoy

93
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,150
whatever you have.

94
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,100
You enjoy it fully, absolutely,

95
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,110
and you don’t hanker after something that is not there.

96
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,020
Doesn’t matter if you don’t have.

97
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,010
Many a times people have asked Me,

98
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,150
“Mother, why not we have the puja of Krishna as Kubera?”

99
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,120
I said, “All right.

100
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,070
Just now everybody’s trying to become Kuber.

101
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,160
Let them learn a lesson,

102
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,170
and then we will have the puja of Kubera.”

103
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,060
And that’s why today I’ve agreed to have this puja.

104
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,120
Because now you have seen what happens if you have greed.

105
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,150
You go on committing all kinds of sins,

106
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,010
all kinds of wrong things which can destroy your country.

107
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,240
Such a rich country has now become a poor country.

108
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,160
Where is that money gone?

109
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,050
They’re very clever.

110
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,240
Somebody told Me today that this money with the insurance.

111
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,120
“My God,” I said, “the law is such that

112
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,230
you can’t get out that money.”

113
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:51,080
Secondly they said that it is in offshore and all that.

114
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:57,060
I said, “But see now, they were never afraid

115
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,230
that they'll be caught up,

116
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,040
and they continued for so many years.

117
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,080
But I’m sure one day

118
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,170
they'll all be exposed by Kubera Himself.”

119
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,090
So today by worshipping Kubera what we are doing,

120
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:26,080
we are going to establish, establish the truth of money,

121
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,010
what lies behind the money,

122
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:41,000
what is the point of having money.

123
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,040
This country had money.

124
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,160
As a result so many good people came here to work,

125
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,070
and you had so many complementary things.

126
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,180
You had lots of people who have complemented,

127
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,000
because I think in certain things Americans were little less;

128
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,080
not in intelligence, but in brilliance I think

129
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,220
they were little bit lacking.

130
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,050
So they got very brilliant people from abroad,

131
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:16,180
and also they were very focused people,

132
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,110
so they worked it out very well.

133
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,040
Also they respected people who came with brains.

134
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,220
So this is what happens when you forget

135
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,010
that truth is the main point.

136
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:37,020
If you don’t have the truth, no use having money.

137
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,000
Because what you did was to go around with this thing,

138
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:48,150
that thing, I mean all kinds of things, to just get money.

139
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,170
The other day I was traveling through Las Vegas – last year.

140
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,120
And when we stopped at that airport

141
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,040
so many people walked into the aeroplane,

142
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,190
and they all were looking as if somebody’s dead

143
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,180
in their family or what has happened.

144
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,060
First I couldn’t understand.

145
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,120
Then said, “Mother, they have lost all their money.”

146
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,110
So when they have money, they are jumping, next moment

147
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,240
they are crying because they have lost the money.

148
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,120
What’s the use of such a money

149
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:30,010
which is so temporary, which is so useless?

150
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,240
But that is human nature, to run after maya.

151
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:43,010
And this is the quality of money, that it gives you maya.

152
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,090
Maya like this, that they get a little money somehow;

153
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,210
with that little money, they buy something.

154
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,060
Then they think money is very important.

155
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,100
You see, you can buy lots of things,

156
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,110
you can buy cars, you can buy airplanes, this, that.

157
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:08,120
So there is where maya plays on you, and you start running

158
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,010
after that mad money which makes you mad.

159
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,220
It’s nice that at this juncture they have discovered

160
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,200
the falsehood of this maya money.

161
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,020
And I am so happy that they were all handcuffed,

162
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:32,010
and all their power of money was finished.

163
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:37,120
So, this Kubera is working out all these tricks.

164
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,080
Krishna is a very tricky, extremely tricky personality.

165
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:50,240
He puts the tricks, every action after every action.

166
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,080
Now money matters:

167
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,010
He first befools you that you run after it,

168
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,180
and then you just discover that it was stupidity.

169
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,000
We have a story in our land, country, called “Sheikh Chili.”

170
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,080
He got little money,

171
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:19,060
and he got into the grab of this maya.

172
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,220
So he thought, “I can do very well.”

173
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,020
So he started dreaming as to what he should do.

174
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,040
So he went and bought lots of eggs and he said,

175
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:35,040
“Now these eggs will have little, little chicks which will grow,

176
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,090
which will I’ll sell and I’ll so much money,”

177
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,100
and it was like that he was talking.

178
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:46,230
And while thinking about it in his mind went off to sleep,

179
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,190
and then in his sleep he fell on the eggs

180
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,080
and all the eggs broke.

181
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,130
So the maya was over.

182
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,100
This should happen early, but if it doesn’t happen

183
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,100
then you end up in the jail or something like that.

184
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:13,020
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which gives you a complete vision,

185
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,070
complete vision of the destruction

186
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,010
that can follow this maya business.

187
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,070
It is something, such a insight

188
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,100
that you don’t have to do anything with it.

189
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,010
I'm different, I told you I don’t understand it at all.

190
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,010
But even if you understand the value of money,

191
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,020
even if you understand that money can bring

192
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:47,090
lots of things to you, despite that you don’t look at it,

193
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:53,160
just turn your face – that is the sign of a real Sahaja yogi.

194
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,080
To him it doesn’t matter, temperamentally.

195
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,020
It’s not that he does something for that or tells his mind, nothing;

196
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:07,060
temperamentally he doesn’t care for money,

197
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:11,140
just because he’s above it.

198
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,170
The one who is above money is a real Sahaja yogi.

199
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,200
The one who is engulfed in the nonsense

200
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:24,020
and the maya of money is not a Sahaja yogi.

201
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,130
Of course I have seen most of the Sahaja yogis

202
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,000
are extremely honest, specially in the West.

203
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,120
But in India there’s a disease: as you have some here viruses,

204
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,100
we have certain viruses in India also.

205
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,010
So they still go on running after money,

206
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,130
to them money is important.

207
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,220
But in the evolutionary process if you reach a certain state

208
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,140
where you rise above your Nabhi Chakra,

209
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:56,000
rise your Nabhi Chakra, then money’s not so important.

210
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,170
It’s not so important.

211
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:12,030
To Me, I find I cannot buy things unnecessarily.

212
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,230
Of course I mean there are so many unnecessary things

213
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,140
gathered, because you people give Me here presents, this that.

214
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:26,000
But Myself, you’ll be amazed, I’m so nervous or I should say

215
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:32,120
hesitant, or you may call it absolutely absent from the spot

216
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,100
where they are doing any business, any purchasing.

217
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,240
Come here and fix it please.

218
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,170
It falls down, so I'm holding on!

219
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,090
Correct, now all right.

220
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:09,190
In the same way, Sahaja yogis have to fix their mind

221
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,210
to their spirit,

222
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:26,090
and enjoy the powers of your spirit, your own.

223
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:33,060
That enjoyment once you get it, you don’t fall to your greed.

224
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,030
This is something

225
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,000
very, very simple,

226
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,080
but sometimes you don’t do it.

227
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,010
You get enamored by something, maybe a car,

228
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,120
maybe aeroplane, I don’t know what – whatever it is.

229
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:58,020
It’s a headache to have too many cars, isn’t it?

230
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,140
But people have;

231
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,060
they think by that people are impressed,

232
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,150
and they think no end of themselves or not – nothing.

233
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,220
If they are impressed, what is the use to us?

234
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,200
What do you get out of it?

235
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:20,120
Sahaja yogi has his own spirit to enjoy,

236
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,100
more than anything else.

237
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,220
He doesn’t want to possess anything.

238
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,020
It’s a headache to possess things also.

239
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,110
The other side of it is a Mahalakshmi.

240
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,180
If that principle is within you, Mahalakshmi Principle,

241
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,200
you’ll have never a problem of money.

242
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,080
On the contrary, you’ll know how to stop it.

243
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,220
So far as I am concerned,

244
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,140
I get fed up of My Mahalakshmi Principle

245
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,110
because I don’t know from where it works out,

246
00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:01,140
how it works out, without any effort.

247
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:08,240
But the temperamentally, I have no interest at all,

248
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,200
temperamentally.

249
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:19,120
But it is the, I don’t know what is the cause of this effect.

250
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:25,010
Now supposing I buy some small thing, just like that,

251
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,220
it will sell at least ten times more.

252
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,160
It will be of value at least ten times more, I don’t know how.

253
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:41,130
It’s very surprising – automatically.

254
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:49,000
I’ll buy something very small, then I find it’s very expensive.

255
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,220
How it works, just must be miracles of Mahalakshmi, I think.

256
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,160
So what I have to tell you is this,

257
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:05,190
that you should not worry about your financial situations

258
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,030
at all.

259
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,090
Do not go on calculating,

260
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:15,000
do not see how much money you have in the bank,

261
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,000
what you have to do with your money,

262
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,140
where you should invest.

263
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,000
I have seen people going mad planning the whole thing.

264
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,090
There’s no need to do that once you are a Sahaja yogi.

265
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,000
It all works automatically.

266
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,090
The greed is within you, just like any other disease.

267
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,050
As you have diseases, greed is also there.

268
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,140
As your diseases can get cured with Sahaja Yoga,

269
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:52,230
your diseases, as much as your greed is, it vanishes.

270
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,150
You don’t know what is greed is.

271
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,120
The only way to counter-balance is to become extremely

272
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,090
generous.

273
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:11,020
If you are extremely generous, greed will run away.

274
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,120
That may be another way of doing it.

275
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:21,050
Supposing you get something in your house

276
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,070
and you think it is too much.

277
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,030
Not to get rid of it but just to think it’s too much,

278
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,050
you should give it to someone; you just start thinking,

279
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,050
whom can you give?

280
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,240
And immediately you’ll remember,

281
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,100
“Oh, that person doesn’t have this. Let me give him this.”

282
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,160
And if you give him he’ll be so thankful, so thankful,

283
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,110
and he’ll say all kinds of nice things to you

284
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
which normally nobody would say to you, nobody.

285
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:02,090
And it’s surprising how joy-giving it is,

286
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,040
how people like your generosity.

287
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,160
So you have to be generous, just generous;

288
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,130
not with yourself, but with others.

289
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:19,050
As much as possible, be generous.

290
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:28,090
Generosity is very love-giving, one of the expressions

291
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,090
of your love.

292
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,190
Many a times it has happened with Me

293
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:40,190
that I saw somebody needed something,

294
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,080
and kept it in My mind.

295
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,090
Then I bought that thing and gave it to that person.

296
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,140
And the amount of love that person gave Me

297
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,040
was thousand time more

298
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:05,000
than what I would have got joy out of buying it, by that thing.

299
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:09,100
It was so insipid for Me, but for him it was.... He told so

300
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,040
many people, “Mother gave me this. Mother gave me.”

301
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,220
I mean, I was surprised.

302
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,180
Then they asked Me, “Mother, how did You give him?”

303
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,170
I said, “Just out of love.”

304
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,080
Many people took to Sahaja Yoga thinking,

305
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:29,030
“What a generosity is!”

306
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:33,220
So to be generous is the best way to live in this world.

307
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,000
After all it’s a headache to have too many things.

308
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,210
Better to get rid of them, but out of love.

309
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,180
If you do that,

310
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:52,080
you’ll be know how much they’ll be appreciative of you.

311
00:24:53,090 --> 00:25:00,200
Another thing is, to get greed of, to get rid of greed

312
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,120
you should try to do some sort of a collective social work.

313
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:13,150
Supposing you go to some place where lots of poor people

314
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,110
are there, I tell you your greed will just drop out.

315
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,240
You’ll be amazed how these people are living,

316
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,030
in what conditions.

317
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,110
“Why do I care for all the wealth and everything?”

318
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,060
That will be just shocking.

319
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:35,120
Sometimes, you see, you see people

320
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,150
in India also in a very bad condition.

321
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,170
Once I went to Calcutta

322
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:50,200
and I was so – somehow or other you see by chance,

323
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:56,040
I happened to be in places where people were very, in a very,

324
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,150
very great poverty, even the children.

325
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,210
And you’ll be amazed, for days together I wouldn’t eat My food.

326
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,040
I was crying and not eating My food, I just didn’t know

327
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,100
what to do.

328
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,220
Because I felt, “What is this?

329
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,120
Why these people are so poor?”

330
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,120
And I was helpless so I was crying,

331
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:29,100
that one day I should try to do something for them.

332
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,010
It is really remarkable, at a very young age of Mine

333
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:43,060
I started a leper home, I started a infirmary, a refugee home,

334
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,120
all kinds of things.

335
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,210
And I never even thought that whatever money I have,

336
00:26:55,070 --> 00:27:02,070
if I give to these people I may have to give up some things.

337
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,140
I also sold some of My things,

338
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:10,130
because so pleasure-giving I tell you, so pleasure-giving,

339
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:14,160
so joy-giving to be generous.

340
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:22,060
It is so pain in every way that you should be generous.

341
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,170
That is the quality of Kubera.

342
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,070
He’s an extremely generous personality,

343
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,140
and that’s what’s personality you should be.

344
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,150
So, I’ve seen that Sahaja yogis are very generous.

345
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:46,010
So far nobody has told Me that somebody is a miserly fellow –

346
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,100
so far, so far.

347
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:55,240
But I’m sure one day will come when we’ll have people

348
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:00,010
of very high quality.

349
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,080
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t say like other cults say that

350
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:10,130
you give up your clothes, you give up your family, you stay,

351
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:16,240
stay in a forest or in a hut or anything – nothing of the kind.

352
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,120
Don’t give up anything.

353
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,220
You have to give up from your heart.

354
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,220
Just it should happen in your personality;

355
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,210
don’t have to give up.

356
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:40,010
And if you have that well-built in spirituality,

357
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:48,060
you’ll not even think of grabbing someone.

358
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,100
On the contrary,

359
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,190
you would like to give up everything.

360
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,060
My father was even worse than Me, I should say.

361
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:03,130
He always used to leave the house open, all doors open.

362
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,140
He said, “No thief will come in if you keep the doors closed.”

363
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,110
So one day a thief came

364
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,160
and he took away his gramophone – in the old times,

365
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,190
these big horn ones – he took away.

366
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,160
The next day My father was sitting, very sad.

367
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,100
So My mother asked him,

368
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,130
“Why are you sad, because of the gramophone?”

369
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,120
“No, I’m only sad because it seems he is a connoisseur of

370
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:38,110
music, he has taken the gramophone but no records.”

371
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,240
So My mother said, “All right, what should we do?

372
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:46,060
Should we advertise in the newspaper that you take away

373
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,210
your records?”

374
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:57,070
I mean, it's such a beauty, that even after so many years

375
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,220
I am telling you and you are enjoying.

376
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,220
What a beautiful character it was of generosity.

377
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:11,030
But if you force it through religion,

378
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:16,000
through any such ideas that “you give up that, you give” –

379
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:19,010
don’t have to give up.

380
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,140
You give up from within.

381
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:28,120
If you are not attached to it, you have given up.

382
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,060
That much should be there and if you all enjoy your

383
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,200
generosity and charity, nothing like it!

384
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,200
I have known people who are very rich and all that,

385
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,040
but they lack generosity.

386
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,160
That is another quality of Kubera.

387
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,190
He perhaps understand banking, perhaps.

388
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,050
That time there were no banks but I think must be,

389
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,030
because the way He manages banks, you know,

390
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,080
it seems to Me that He’s sitting on top of them,

391
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,010
and that’s why still in the banks there is no problem.

392
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,210
I don’t know.

393
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:19,090
But He’s a very clever person,

394
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,220
very intelligent,

395
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,110
very alert,

396
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:32,150
which is important if you have to deal with money –

397
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,050
though He was absolutely detached from money.

398
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,020
And just see His life, what He did.

399
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:47,040
He lived in childhood with His guru,

400
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,160
and He used to take

401
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:59,120
what you call the cows and herds outside in the jungles.

402
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:07,130
That is how He lived in His childhood, and later on

403
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,230
He was playing with the boys

404
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,230
who were looking after the cows in a very,

405
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,070
I mean, ordinary family.

406
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:30,120
He never hankered after money.

407
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,230
He used to steal,

408
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:40,020
used to steal the butter,

409
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:46,120
because these ladies used to sell these to Kamsa’s

410
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,050
military people.

411
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,100
So He used to eat that,

412
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,030
so that this lady should not give it to them.

413
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:04,090
Just imagine, such a little boy like Him.

414
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:11,110
So actually, how He was teaching them a lesson.

415
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,210
Those ladies were greedy, and wanted to give that

416
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,220
to these horrible soldiers,

417
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:24,070
and He would eat all that butter Himself.

418
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,120
In everything that He did,

419
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,150
what you see is extreme generosity, extreme generosity.

420
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,020
With all His intelligence He, He was so good.

421
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,200
And He killed

422
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,210
His own uncle, I should say;

423
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,090
but for Him it is, was not important,

424
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:05,160
so-called relations were not important.

425
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:09,160
But what you see in our India specially,

426
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,180
that relations are very important.

427
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,130
The father is a thief, his son is thief, his grandson is a thief,

428
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:22,090
all of them are thieves – can you imagine?

429
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:28,090
I haven’t seen in a family if there’s one person who is a thief,

430
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:33,010
any one his progeny are honest.

431
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,170
It’s a very funny thing, but such greed crawls into their minds

432
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:43,150
that they don’t think is important.

433
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:49,150
They just think that stealing is the only way one can live.

434
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:54,190
Though in India there are people who are extremely honest.

435
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,080
I have seen our servants,

436
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,180
they never steal anything, nothing, never.

437
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,210
I don’t know, they have no reasoning for it,

438
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,050
it’s a matter of habit.

439
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:10,220
They never steal anything – very surprising.

440
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,170
Why, why don’t they steal?

441
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:22,130
They’re happy with their lives, they don’t want to change it.

442
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:28,010
They don’t want to have these horrible things

443
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,190
that can put them in jail.

444
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,090
But they don’t know,

445
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:38,000
they don’t even think about it; just they just don’t do it.

446
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,120
Why, because they have a sense of shame.

447
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,230
In the poorer peoples, sense of shame is very,

448
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,010
very developed.

449
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:59,050
In that society they have a great respect for people who are

450
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,040
honest, and they are all honest.

451
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,240
One of them may be not,

452
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,240
but they have no respect for such a person,

453
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:16,210
because they think self-respect is the biggest thing.

454
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,090
Can you imagine these poor people?

455
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,120
They have food once a day,

456
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,110
but to them their self-respect is above everything.

457
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:34,190
So the third solution for this kind of a nonsensical greed is

458
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,230
your self-respect.

459
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,140
Why should you steal,

460
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,070
why should you have anything that is stolen,

461
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,190
or why should you have anything that belongs

462
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,140
to another person?

463
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,170
If you have that self-respect within you,

464
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:58,080
you won’t touch anything that is not yours.

465
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,210
When the servants can do that, why not people

466
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:07,060
who are not that badly off?

467
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:13,030
It is a temperament of a higher level, I think,

468
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,050
which they develop, where their self-respect

469
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:21,020
is much more important than all kinds of

470
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,120
other things that may satisfy their greed.

471
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:31,010
But one thing about greed is, it is never satisfied.

472
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,000
It is never satisfied.

473
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,000
I’ve seen people who were very rich once upon a time,

474
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,190
became very, very poor.

475
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,070
So to them life has become hell.

476
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:49,050
They can’t live with, without their great,

477
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,140
I should say, pomp and show,

478
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,020
but they don’t understand that it was false.

479
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:04,100
They just go on feeling extremely

480
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:09,150
downtrodden when they lose their money.

481
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:14,150
Then there are people who want to have money;

482
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:21,000
they’ll do anything but get money.

483
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:27,150
It’s a very funny thing, but also power is the same as that.

484
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,150
If you have your own powers,

485
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,160
you don’t hanker after these powers.

486
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,230
But they want to have power because

487
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:40,150
they want to have money, and they get power with money –

488
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,120
can you imagine?

489
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,220
Where are human beings, at what level?

490
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,040
At what level of evolution they are?

491
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:54,240
They are going round and round the circle of this money.

492
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:58,190
This is Nabhi Chakra

493
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,090
which has to improve,

494
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:04,190
which gives you satisfaction.

495
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,020
If your Nabhi Chakra is satisfied,

496
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,100
you have achieved the state of Kubera.

497
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,000
That’s very important, to see

498
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,230
that your Nabhi should be satisfied.

499
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:25,070
There are so many other kinds of things we have,

500
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:29,110
but I think now the worst is this greed.

501
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,130
And this, if it is managed somehow or other,

502
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,130
brought to its own level,

503
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:41,080
then I think world will improve very much.

504
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,010
May God bless you.
