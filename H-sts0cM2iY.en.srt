1
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,947
We all can change and inform each other

2
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:15,185
and improve and educate ourselves.

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,441
All this education can come to us,

4
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,257
if we
really love ourselves,

5
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:21,445
and care for our evolution.

6
00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:23,833
We don’t have to bother about it much,

7
00:00:23,913 --> 00:00:25,880
if we really care for it.

8
00:00:25,961 --> 00:00:28,112
Gradually, all these things will work out

9
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:32,369
and the balance can be established.

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,203
Those people who talk too much,

11
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:37,701
should not
talk so much.

12
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:41,737
What I feel that when you talk too much, when you stop, you just stop.

13
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:45,435
It is in between: when it is necessary
you must talk,

14
00:00:45,636 --> 00:00:49,317
when it is not necessary you should not talk.

15
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:52,345
So that kind of personality gradually

16
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:54,762
you can develop with Sahaja Yoga,

17
00:00:54,843 --> 00:00:58,669
that you will develop that wisdom

18
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:02,203
how far to go, how far not to go.

19
00:01:02,404 --> 00:01:05,468
Not to go is the quality of Shiva.

20
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,016
He doesn’t do anything, He is just sitting down there

21
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:11,450
and watching the whole joke.

22
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:17,262
He doesn’t do anything, but still,

23
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:18,751
He’s the one who has to watch:

24
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:24,393
if He doesn’t watch, then the whole show is over.

25
00:01:25,488 --> 00:01:28,748
If you understand that in not doing anything,

26
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:31,702
how much He’s doing!

27
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:35,611
See the contrast: He’s doing nothing as such.

28
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:39,840
But He’s making everybody dance, to please Him.

29
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:44,648
In the same way, in one shot you have both the natures:

30
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:50,678
as Sahaja Yogis you can achieve that kind of a balanced personality.

31
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:57,698
It is for your good, for your evolution, for your development.

32
00:01:57,908 --> 00:02:02,013
So today, all of you have a great chance of evolving

33
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:05,662
individually within yourself the Shiva tattwa,

34
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:12,740
which ultimately permeates into the whole.

35
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:15,966
Kabira has said it in a beautiful couplet,

36
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:18,619
I don’t know if you people have understood,

37
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,266
which is: “Man mamta ko Thir kar launga”.

38
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:29,910
"The compassion of my heart I will vibrate, I will bring it out;

39
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:36,632
the compassion of my heart I will vibrate, I’ll bring it out;

40
00:02:36,827 --> 00:02:39,062
“Aur paancho tattwa milaunga”,

41
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:42,348
and put it into the five elements."

42
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:44,917
See Kabira, do you follow him how great he is?

43
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,241
People talk of Kabir Das, see, he says that,

44
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:52,705
“Take it out of the heart and put it into all the five elements.”

45
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:55,726
This is what is Sahaja Yoga.

46
00:02:55,927 --> 00:03:00,771
If you understand that, then you don’t have to understand anything else.

47
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,771
You have got it in your heart, become the capitalist in your heart,

48
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:07,805
and become a communist outside.

49
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:13,049
If you can achieve this balance properly, you have done it.

50
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:19,448
And we can do it, we all of us put together 
we will do it, we can achieve it;

51
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:23,320
and we can show to the world that everyone can achieve it.

52
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:29,481
All ordinary human beings so-called 
will, can become extraordinary.
