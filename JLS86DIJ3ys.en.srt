1
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:35,200
So welcome to you all, Sahaja Yogis,

2
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:41,659
to this great country of yoga.

3
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:54,950
Today first of all we have to establish

4
00:09:56,617 --> 00:10:02,200
our desire within ourselves

5
00:10:02,283 --> 00:10:04,950
that we are seekers

6
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:12,200
and that we have to achieve our full growth and maturity.

7
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:19,200
Today's puja is for the whole universe.

8
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:24,783
The whole universe

9
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,700
should be enlightened with your desires.

10
00:10:30,117 --> 00:10:34,033
Your desires should be so intense

11
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:38,450
that they should emit out

12
00:10:38,534 --> 00:10:44,117
the pure vibrations of Mahakali Shakti,

13
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,283
which is the pure desire

14
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:53,700
of attaining the spirit.

15
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,367
That's the real desire.

16
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:03,699
All the other desires are like mirage.

17
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:15,699
You are the people who are chosen by God.

18
00:11:17,783 --> 00:11:25,783
Specially, first to express your desire,

19
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:29,700
and then to achieve it.

20
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:41,450
And by intense desire of purity

21
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:46,200
you have to purify the whole world.

22
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:48,450
Not only the seekers,

23
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:52,783
but even those who are not seekers.

24
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:05,534
You have to create an aura around this universe,

25
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:13,534
of desire to achieve the ultimate,

26
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:17,033
the spirit.

27
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:29,117
Without desire this universe would not have been created.

28
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:41,200
This Desire of God is the one that is the Holy Ghost,

29
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:45,367
is this all-pervading power,

30
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,450
is the Kundalini within you.

31
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:54,700
Kundalini has only one desire,

32
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:58,283
is to be the spirit

33
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:03,283
and anything else if you desire

34
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,450
the Kundalini doesn't rise.

35
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,950
Only when it knows

36
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:17,617
that this desire is going to be fulfilled

37
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:28,617
by somebody, who is facing the seeker,

38
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,283
it is awakened.

39
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:40,950
If you do not have the desire,

40
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,950
no-one can force you.

41
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:46,450
Sahaja Yogis should never try

42
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:51,783
to force this desire on other people.

43
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:54,450
The first ordeal we face,

44
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:58,033
as soon as you get your Realization,

45
00:13:58,117 --> 00:14:03,700
is that you just start thinking of your family.

46
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:08,367
You start thinking: 'My mother has not got it,

47
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,699
my father has not got it,

48
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,367
my wife has not got it,

49
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:18,699
my children have not got it.'

50
00:14:21,117 --> 00:14:27,617
You must know that these relations are worldly.

51
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,866
Sanskrit is loukik.

52
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,450
They are not aloukik,

53
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:36,450
they are not beyond the worldly relationships.

54
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:38,699
These are worldly relations,

55
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:41,950
and these attachments are worldly.

56
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:46,950
So if you play into that of course as you know,

57
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:50,367
that Mahamaya Shakti allows you to play with that.

58
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,617
You go ahead, as long as you like.

59
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:57,200
People bring Me all their relations,

60
00:14:57,283 --> 00:14:59,450
parents, this and that

61
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,950
and ultimately they discover

62
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:07,283
that this was a very wrong thing they did.

63
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:14,283
They lost so many precious moments,

64
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:16,950
so many hours, so many years,

65
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:19,866
wasting their energy on people

66
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:25,033
who never deserved any attention of Mother.

67
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:31,534
Sooner you realize the better that this desire

68
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:36,783
may be within you,

69
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:42,534
and may not be in anyone of your so-called worldly relations.

70
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:47,450
Makes no difference.

71
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:49,866
As Christ was told

72
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,783
that His brothers and sisters are waiting outside,

73
00:15:53,866 --> 00:16:00,283
He said: 'Who are My brothers and who are My sisters?'

74
00:16:02,283 --> 00:16:06,367
So one has to realize that those people who involve themselves

75
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,783
into the problems of their family all the time,

76
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,866
and attract My attention,

77
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:16,700
you must know that I am just playing about.

78
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:20,783
It is of no value to you.

79
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,450
For your ascent it is important first of all

80
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:26,783
to have no desires

81
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:31,950
to create desire in your kith and kin.

82
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:36,950
This is the first principle of establishment

83
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:41,117
of Mahakali Power.

84
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:46,866
Specially in India

85
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,534
where people are too much attached to their family,

86
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:54,367
it's a very big problem.

87
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:57,783
If you give Realization to one person,

88
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:02,534
you are amazed to see that all relationship they have

89
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:06,117
is with a big bunch of bhoots.

90
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:12,367
And once you give Realization to one person you are in for trouble.

91
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:16,617
Then all the bhoots walk in, slowly,

92
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,283
torturing My life, wasting My energy,

93
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:24,033
and absolutely disgusting.

94
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:27,367
It should happen to you to understand

95
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,534
that this is not auspicious.

96
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,200
If you want to waste your time,

97
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:37,117
I will allow you to waste your time.

98
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:43,450
But if you want to have the ascent fast,

99
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:45,699
first of all one must remember

100
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:50,700
that these are relations which are absolutely worldly relations

101
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:54,700
and this is not your pure desire.

102
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,534
So try to separate your pure desire

103
00:17:59,617 --> 00:18:03,783
from your worldly desires.

104
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:08,283
It does not by any means,

105
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:13,117
suggest that you give up your family,

106
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,699
you give up your mother or give up your sister - nothing.

107
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,033
But you witness them

108
00:18:20,117 --> 00:18:26,200
and see, as you would see anybody else,

109
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:31,699
and see for yourself, whether

110
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:35,699
they are really desirous or not.

111
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:37,450
If they are - well and good.

112
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:41,117
They should not be disqualified because they are your relations.

113
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,033
It works both ways.

114
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:46,783
As they cannot be qualified because they are your relations,

115
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:52,117
they cannot be disqualified because they're your relations.

116
00:18:52,200 --> 00:19:00,367
So in Sahaja Yoga to make your desire a pure desire,

117
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:07,699
you have to get out of so many things.

118
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:12,283
But for people who are attached to their family,

119
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:16,033
are bound by their family,

120
00:19:16,283 --> 00:19:18,200
they have to see to it

121
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:22,200
that they do not force Sahaja Yoga on anyone of their relations,

122
00:19:22,283 --> 00:19:26,283
at least don't force them on Me.

123
00:20:34,242 --> 00:20:40,409
Now this desire within us,

124
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:44,908
which is the Mahakali Power which is manifesting,

125
00:20:44,991 --> 00:20:48,367
comes to us in so many ways.

126
00:20:48,492 --> 00:20:50,908
As I told you first of all,

127
00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:53,450
it comes to us after Realization,

128
00:20:53,575 --> 00:20:55,825
because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

129
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:01,409
to do something about our relations.

130
00:21:01,617 --> 00:21:04,866
Then the second desire that comes to us,

131
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:09,991
that let us try to cure people,

132
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:14,617
who are our relations.

133
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:17,075
This is the second desire,

134
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,617
you should face yourself and see,

135
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,825
that this has happened to many of you.

136
00:21:21,908 --> 00:21:27,450
So, right from leprosy

137
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:32,825
to any small thing like cold or sneezing,

138
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:35,158
whatever they have,

139
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:41,117
you think you should bring to Mother.

140
00:21:42,908 --> 00:21:48,409
And all the worries of your families should be brought to Mother.

141
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:52,950
Simple thing like pregnancy or sneezing,

142
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:58,158
very simple things - which are so natural

143
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:05,409
are brought into your attention.

144
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,866
So when you have them in your attention I say:

145
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:14,325
'All right, go ahead with it. Try to solve it, if possible.'

146
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,075
But if you do not have them in your attention

147
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,117
they are in My attention.

148
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:28,033
You leave them in My attention, I'll manage that.

149
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:32,158
But then it's a vicious circle.

150
00:22:32,825 --> 00:22:36,825
It's a very subtle projection of the mind

151
00:22:36,908 --> 00:22:38,700
that thinks: 'All right,

152
00:22:38,783 --> 00:22:40,908
that Mother we don't have this in our attention,

153
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:46,741
You'd better look after it." That's not the way.

154
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:51,741
You should have only one intense desire within yourself:

155
00:22:51,825 --> 00:22:55,534
"Have I become the spirit?

156
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:59,741
Have I achieved my ultimate?

157
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:04,699
Have I risen above the worldly desires?"

158
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:07,741
Purify it.

159
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:13,575
Once you start purifying whatever falls off,

160
00:23:13,699 --> 00:23:16,825
I'll look after that.

161
00:23:16,908 --> 00:23:22,825
This is just an assurance, but not a guarantee.

162
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:31,325
If it deserves My attention I will definitely look after you.

163
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:40,534
You have to value your attention as I value My attention.

164
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,950
I think you have to value much more of your attention

165
00:23:49,991 --> 00:23:54,699
than Me, because I can manage,

166
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,534
many more things within Myself,

167
00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:02,117
because everything is in My attention.

168
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:08,075
But you try to purify your desires,

169
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,200
away from the worldly problems that are facing you.

170
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:17,200
So you expand it more, then you start thinking:

171
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:24,492
'Mother, what about the problem of our country?'

172
00:24:27,908 --> 00:24:31,492
All right, give Me the map of your country - finished.

173
00:24:31,575 --> 00:24:35,158
That's more than sufficient.

174
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:42,783
Then purify yourself.

175
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:47,991
The desire that you have, you leave it.

176
00:24:48,117 --> 00:24:49,699
And once you are purified

177
00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:52,825
that area will be covered through your attention,

178
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,825
it's very interesting.

179
00:24:56,908 --> 00:25:03,617
When you get over it then only you can throw light,

180
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:06,908
but if you are inside you are hidden by that.

181
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:10,575
Your light is hidden, there's no light emitted.

182
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:13,450
You all rise above that desire.

183
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:16,534
Every time you get a desire you rise above it,

184
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:21,367
so your light is emitted on that wider problem

185
00:25:21,492 --> 00:25:23,242
that you are facing

186
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:28,699
which you think should be solved by Me.

187
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:34,659
These are all My headaches which you are taking on yourself.

188
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,991
You have to do only one thing is to become the spirit

189
00:25:38,117 --> 00:25:40,659
that's all. Is a simple thing.

190
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:45,200
The rest of it is My headache.

191
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:53,575
Now the problems

192
00:25:53,659 --> 00:26:00,659
that should take your desire on the collective

193
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:08,492
should be very different.

194
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:14,367
To substantiate your purity,

195
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:19,617
to be fragrant with your purity,

196
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,991
your attention should be on the other side.

197
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:24,783
Now you are not facing Me,

198
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:27,033
you are sitting with Me facing the whole world.

199
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:32,450
See, the whole attitude will change.

200
00:26:32,534 --> 00:26:37,825
The attitude should be: 'What can I give?

201
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,283
How can I give?

202
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:44,699
What is my mistake in giving?

203
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:47,325
I have to be more alert.

204
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:51,741
Where is my attention?

205
00:26:51,991 --> 00:26:54,242
I have to be more alert towards myself

206
00:26:54,325 --> 00:26:58,617
what am I doing?

207
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:03,741
What's my responsibility?'

208
00:27:05,741 --> 00:27:11,700
You must desire that you should be pure.

209
00:27:11,783 --> 00:27:14,950
You should be pure desire.

210
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:18,783
That means you should be the spirit.

211
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:23,825
That, "What is your responsibility to yourself?"

212
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:30,075
You should desire that your responsibility to yourself

213
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,908
should be manifested,

214
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:38,492
should be complete.

215
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:44,283
Then your responsibility to this Sahaja Yoga.

216
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:48,283
What is your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

217
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,825
which is the work of God,

218
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:57,367
which has started and you are My hands.

219
00:27:59,117 --> 00:28:03,242
You have to do the work of God,

220
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:07,700
and you have to fight the anti-God elements,

221
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:10,200
the satanic elements.

222
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:12,825
You are not responsible for your family any more,

223
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,575
those who are, are half-baked Sahaja Yogis

224
00:28:16,699 --> 00:28:20,367
I said, are useless absolutely good for nothing.

225
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:23,200
All such will drop out, their families will suffer,

226
00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:25,866
I know this is going to happen.

227
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:28,367
Because now the forces are gathering in such a way

228
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:32,117
that sorting out will start.

229
00:28:32,242 --> 00:28:37,617
Your responsibility to yourself, to be the spirit,

230
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:43,825
your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

231
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:48,991
your responsibility to understand Me,

232
00:28:49,117 --> 00:28:53,659
better and better and better.

233
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,741
Your responsibility to understand this mechanism

234
00:28:56,825 --> 00:28:59,825
that is within you,

235
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,033
your responsibility to understand how this mechanism

236
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:08,700
works out everything.

237
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:14,699
The responsibility is to how to become a guru yourself.

238
00:29:15,617 --> 00:29:21,158
Your responsibility to be a dignified and a glorified personality.

239
00:29:21,283 --> 00:29:23,950
A responsibility to be a respectable person

240
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:28,825
and not a cheap personality.

241
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,950
Every one of you

242
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:39,242
is worth the whole universe.

243
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:45,450
If you want to rise to that height.

244
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:53,117
Universes of universes can be thrown away at your feet.

245
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,200
If you want to rise to that height,

246
00:29:56,283 --> 00:30:02,325
to that magnitude that is within you to prosper.

247
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:06,908
But those people,

248
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:16,950
who still want to live on a very low level cannot rise.

249
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,325
For example,

250
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:26,117
the western Sahaja Yogis have certain problems

251
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:34,492
of committing the sin against the Mother,

252
00:30:34,617 --> 00:30:37,659
and the eastern Sahaja Yogis have the problem

253
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:42,450
of committing sin against the Father.

254
00:30:43,534 --> 00:30:49,450
It's not difficult at all

255
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:55,741
for you to get out of it.

256
00:31:02,492 --> 00:31:10,575
The attention is to be kept pure.

257
00:31:10,783 --> 00:31:15,617
In Sahaja Yoga you know all the methods

258
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:20,991
how the attention one can keep it pure.

259
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,242
If the attention is not pure

260
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:26,450
then this desire

261
00:31:26,575 --> 00:31:31,242
will be always attacked

262
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:34,283
by all petty nonsensical things

263
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:38,367
which has no meaning in your ascent.

264
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,409
Now a person who is a good Sahaja Yogi

265
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:44,117
is not bothered about clothes, what others say to him

266
00:31:44,242 --> 00:31:46,367
or what others are talking to him,

267
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,283
how they are behaving towards him and

268
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:52,158
the attention is not on that

269
00:31:52,283 --> 00:31:57,325
criticism that this person is like this, that person is like that.

270
00:31:57,409 --> 00:32:03,200
Nor there is the aggressiveness

271
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:09,367
of anyone else,

272
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,409
because nobody is the other.

273
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:17,283
But the problem is when I say that,

274
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:23,325
no-one thinks that I'm saying about you, each persons.

275
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:27,825
Those who are aggressive take the other role

276
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:34,450
and those who are non-aggressive think the other way.

277
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:38,783
Like I say something for a person who is aggressive,

278
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:42,242
the non-aggressive immediately thinks of the person who is aggressive,

279
00:32:42,325 --> 00:32:45,825
not about himself.

280
00:32:45,908 --> 00:32:49,033
You immediately start shifting your mind to other person,

281
00:32:49,117 --> 00:32:53,699
finding faults with other people.

282
00:32:56,117 --> 00:32:59,991
So this desire becomes

283
00:33:00,117 --> 00:33:05,825
gradually lower and lower and lower

284
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,991
because of the loads that are put onto it.

285
00:33:11,117 --> 00:33:14,492
So the alertness is very important,

286
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:19,617
complete alertness - satarkata,

287
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:24,741
that we should keep our attention

288
00:33:24,825 --> 00:33:32,659
purely for the sustenance of our pure desire.

289
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:38,700
Desire comes from your heart

290
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:40,575
and you are so built

291
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:45,158
that your brahmarandra is also the heart.

292
00:33:45,283 --> 00:33:48,242
If you don't have a clean heart,

293
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:52,700
this won't keep clean.

294
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:55,492
There are people

295
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:58,325
who think if they talk about Sahaja Yoga big,

296
00:33:58,409 --> 00:34:01,492
and all that, they are all right.

297
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:05,033
They are cheating themselves.

298
00:34:05,283 --> 00:34:09,033
If the heart is not open

299
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:12,699
then this is closed.

300
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:18,991
So try to open your heart by projecting.

301
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:28,117
Projecting it.

302
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,242
I hope today when you do this puja

303
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:36,409
and you do the worship of Mahakali

304
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:41,450
and this special yagya,

305
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:46,242
we will definitely establish this aura,

306
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:51,117
and enlighten the universe.

307
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,033
But your outlook should be:

308
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:58,158
'How much I have contributed to this.

309
00:34:59,075 --> 00:35:02,409
Am I still thinking of other people,

310
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:07,617
am I still thinking of my petty small problems,

311
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:13,950
or I'm thinking of my spirit?'

312
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:20,991
So, the left side

313
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:28,325
starts and ends with Shri Ganesh.

314
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:34,741
Shri Ganesh has only basic one quality,

315
00:35:34,825 --> 00:35:37,700
that He's completely surrendered to His Mother,

316
00:35:37,783 --> 00:35:41,492
He does not know any other God,

317
00:35:41,617 --> 00:35:45,242
He does not even know His Father.

318
00:35:45,783 --> 00:35:47,950
He only knows His Mother

319
00:35:48,075 --> 00:35:54,534
and completely surrendered to Her.

320
00:35:58,075 --> 00:36:04,200
But this pure desire has to have the action,

321
00:36:04,825 --> 00:36:06,908
and about which I'll tell you later

322
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:11,575
as we will be having more pujas and more pujas.

323
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:17,492
But today let us establish ourselves

324
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:25,575
into that pure desire, to be the spirit.

325
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:33,741
Now, as it is, with the western mind we'll say: 'How?'

326
00:36:36,117 --> 00:36:41,242
Is always coming, "How to do it?"

327
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:47,991
Should I tell you? It's very simple.

328
00:36:48,117 --> 00:36:52,991
Adi Shankaracharya wrote 'Viveka Chudamani'

329
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:57,575
and so many other books of treaties,

330
00:36:57,659 --> 00:37:04,200
and then all these big intellectuals got after his life.

331
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:06,575
And they said:

332
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:09,783
'How this and how that and how?'

333
00:37:09,866 --> 00:37:12,367
He said: 'Forget these people.'

334
00:37:12,492 --> 00:37:17,158
Then he wrote 'Saundarya Lahari',

335
00:37:17,242 --> 00:37:19,367
it's just a description of his Mother

336
00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:21,908
and his devotion to Her

337
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:31,409
and every couplet that He wrote is a mantra.

338
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:33,783
It is not the surrender

339
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:39,783
of your mind through your mind,

340
00:37:39,908 --> 00:37:45,659
but the surrender of your heart.

341
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:52,617
Is absolutely the surrender of your heart.

342
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:56,659
Western Sahaja Yogis know very well

343
00:37:56,825 --> 00:38:00,200
how there have been attacks

344
00:38:00,283 --> 00:38:04,200
and attacks of negativity on them,

345
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:10,866
specially when horrible people like Freud

346
00:38:11,409 --> 00:38:18,825
came to destroy their basic, the roots.

347
00:38:18,908 --> 00:38:24,200
And how the West accepted it blindfolded,

348
00:38:24,325 --> 00:38:29,367
and put them on the path of hell.

349
00:38:29,492 --> 00:38:33,200
All that has to be brought out.

350
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:37,492
That is all nonsense, is wrong, absolutely

351
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:42,450
against God, it's anti-God activity.

352
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:45,991
Then you will realize

353
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:54,492
that you will fight fully, by saying,

354
00:38:54,617 --> 00:39:01,283
"This is the destruction of our basics, our roots,

355
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:02,825
when our Mother is the source

356
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:07,700
of everything that is sublime, noble,

357
00:39:08,117 --> 00:39:11,075
all that is nourishing,

358
00:39:11,158 --> 00:39:16,700
all that is elevating, emancipating.

359
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:20,325
You have cutting us from our roots.

360
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:25,908
"When he dealt with, I think, animal-like creatures

361
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:33,158
and he wants all of you to go down to that low level

362
00:39:33,283 --> 00:39:36,866
of human beings,

363
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:45,033
which exist as pathological cases, I don't know.

364
00:39:45,158 --> 00:39:48,700
So it is important for you to understand all the attacks

365
00:39:48,825 --> 00:39:50,409
that came on you,

366
00:39:50,492 --> 00:39:51,991
and be alert

367
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:57,699
and don't be identified with anyone of these.

368
00:39:57,741 --> 00:40:01,117
Last I would say you have come to this country

369
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,659
to see the roots and not the shoot.

370
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,075
Change your attitude of western style.

371
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,575
Telephones are no good.

372
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,075
You cannot get any telephones done here.

373
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,325
Postage is horrible.

374
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,450
Railways are worst.

375
00:40:19,575 --> 00:40:25,700
I shouldn't say because we are in a railway.

376
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:37,825
But, the people are excellent.

377
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,783
They know what is dharma.

378
00:40:39,908 --> 00:40:41,700
They are not being attacked, somehow or other

379
00:40:41,825 --> 00:40:43,699
because it being the Kundalini.

380
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:49,367
The Ganesha is sitting here how dare anybody attack?

381
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:53,825
This great Maharashtra has got eight Ganeshas,

382
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,033
protecting them.

383
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:59,117
I don't know if these Maharashtrians know this fact.

384
00:40:59,242 --> 00:41:01,575
And so many marutis,

385
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:04,325
so who can attack this country?

386
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,700
There is no negative attack

387
00:41:05,825 --> 00:41:11,117
except that they themselves are rather money-minded sort.

388
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:14,283
That's the only curse they have, if they can get out of it

389
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:18,200
they are great people.

390
00:41:21,242 --> 00:41:28,117
So, we have come to this country not to enjoy the comfort

391
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,492
of the West, but the comfort of the spirit.

392
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:39,033
So to change your attitude towards India

393
00:41:39,117 --> 00:41:44,450
I don't mean Air India, by any chance.

394
00:41:44,534 --> 00:41:47,325
This is a wrong idea that you come by Air India

395
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:49,908
because you are a Sahaja Yogi. Not at all.

396
00:41:49,991 --> 00:41:52,991
Air India is nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

397
00:41:53,117 --> 00:41:55,492
All our railways, all our everything,

398
00:41:55,575 --> 00:41:57,534
they have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga,

399
00:41:57,617 --> 00:41:59,950
so far.

400
00:42:02,409 --> 00:42:06,492
So you be patriotic and use your own airlines,

401
00:42:06,617 --> 00:42:10,075
for heaven's sake.

402
00:42:11,325 --> 00:42:13,825
But when you arrive here

403
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:16,950
you will see that the people are too innocent,

404
00:42:17,075 --> 00:42:19,534
they can't understand Freud, you can't talk to them,

405
00:42:19,617 --> 00:42:22,242
it's beyond them.

406
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:24,700
They are a higher type of people in this respect

407
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:26,991
now because they are not attacked,

408
00:42:27,117 --> 00:42:29,783
while you are higher in a way that though you are attacked

409
00:42:29,866 --> 00:42:33,283
you've come out of it.

410
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:36,825
You just turn your faces and you are on the other way.

411
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:42,033
That's something great.

412
00:42:42,158 --> 00:42:44,783
So you would also have a confidence

413
00:42:44,908 --> 00:42:47,950
there are many people who believe the same way as you believe,

414
00:42:48,033 --> 00:42:53,492
in this big country where there's such a big population to support you.

415
00:42:53,617 --> 00:42:58,699
So you shouldn't feel lost.

416
00:42:59,783 --> 00:43:04,492
Thus today, we have to start this puja,

417
00:43:04,617 --> 00:43:08,409
on Mahakali Day.

418
00:43:08,492 --> 00:43:12,825
And it's the Day of the Gauri we can say,

419
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:16,033
and Ganesh-Gauri's Day today,

420
00:43:16,158 --> 00:43:22,659
though according to the schedule time it may not be.

421
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:24,575
But according to Me,

422
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:29,158
let us establish within ourself on a subtler level

423
00:43:29,283 --> 00:43:35,033
the desire to be pure,

424
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:42,409
and to be cleansed out.

425
00:43:42,492 --> 00:43:49,741
All the barriers and unclean things that are within us,

426
00:43:50,325 --> 00:43:54,991
to desire to be great Sahaja Yogis,

427
00:43:55,117 --> 00:44:01,700
desire to be responsible Sahaja Yogis

428
00:44:01,783 --> 00:44:06,699
and desire to be surrendered to your Mother.

429
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,783
It's not difficult.

430
00:44:08,866 --> 00:44:11,908
That is the easiest, the last one is the easiest,

431
00:44:11,991 --> 00:44:13,991
because what you surrender,

432
00:44:14,117 --> 00:44:17,075
I don't want anything from you,

433
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,242
except that you accept My Love.

434
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:27,242
Surrendering just means you open your heart to accept My Love.

435
00:44:27,367 --> 00:44:30,200
Give up this ego.

436
00:44:30,325 --> 00:44:33,534
That's all and it will work out.

437
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:37,825
I'm sure it's going to work out.

438
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:41,325
I am trying to push Myself into your hearts

439
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:45,367
and I'll definitely settle down there.

440
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:47,492
Mahakali has a special capacity to weep,

441
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,741
because She is left-sided.

442
01:09:49,825 --> 01:09:52,242
When She's helpless and She cannot act,

443
01:09:52,367 --> 01:09:55,117
She weeps.

444
01:09:55,242 --> 01:09:57,409
This is the only manifestation

445
01:09:57,534 --> 01:10:00,617
of Mahakali is that She desires,

446
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:04,117
and if She doesn't get Her desire enacted

447
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,617
then She just weeps,

448
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,825
that's the only thing She can do in helplessness, isn't it.

449
01:10:08,991 --> 01:10:13,242
And sometimes when She's full of Love

450
01:10:13,325 --> 01:10:16,367
as I've seen you today all of you coming down here

451
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:19,492
and all these people sitting down here.

452
01:10:19,617 --> 01:10:22,575
When She cannot express Herself fully,

453
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:24,741
with full heart,

454
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:35,075
also She feels that joy pouring as tears.

455
01:10:35,492 --> 01:10:37,367
May God bless you for today's puja,

456
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:41,075
I hope all of you will take it in such a way

457
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,700
that the subtlest of subtle

458
01:10:43,825 --> 01:10:46,367
will be awakened within you, the sensitivity

459
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:50,492
every way, and the Love,

460
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:53,783
which culminates into joy.

461
01:10:53,866 --> 01:11:00,200
Love that flowers into the fragrance of joy

462
01:11:00,325 --> 01:11:05,492
will manifest in today's puja.

463
01:11:05,575 --> 01:11:08,409
May God bless you!
