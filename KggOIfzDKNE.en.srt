1
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:10,394
I am so very filled with joy

2
00:00:11,838 --> 00:00:20,130
 and My heart is so full of gratitude for

3
00:00:20,717 --> 00:00:25,844
all the Sahaja Yogis who have been able

4
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:30,023
to create this beautiful place.

5
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:39,377
 I cannot imagine how much they must have worked hard

6
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:48,551
 in such a place to create such  a beautiful

7
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:56,537
 area, such a blissful place.

8
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:12,205
How in Sahaja Yoga people work together

9
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:18,395
 with tremendous respect and love for each other,

10
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:24,584
and produce something that is unbelievable.

11
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:30,142
This was just a wilderness,

12
00:01:30,817 --> 00:01:35,495
and you have brought so much of

13
00:01:35,955 --> 00:01:40,002
life and light in this place.

14
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:52,510
 You wanted to celebrate My birthday.

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,938
 I don't know what is such a significant about it.

16
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:06,756
 But the way you have really

17
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,132
 shown your understanding and respect,

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,763
I am just enamored.  I can't  understand

19
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:19,684
 what have I done for you, that

20
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:23,081
you should do so much for Sahaja Yoga.

21
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:32,140
 As it is, today is also a very auspicious day

22
00:02:32,673 --> 00:02:35,605
 which we call as the Holi.

23
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:42,388
They play Holion this day and show their love

24
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:46,751
 and oneness among themselves.

25
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:50,963
This is the time when we have to

26
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:56,209
really understand the value of love,

27
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:01,505
of respect of others,

28
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:08,781
 because so far we have based all our theories and

29
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:15,145
 all our ideas on the principle that human beings

30
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:22,755
cannot love each other: they are always trying to overpower others

31
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:27,443
 or to hate others, or to grab things from others.

32
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:32,064
Such a wrong idea we had all these days,

33
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:36,318
 and that's why all the organizations that were created

34
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:40,088
to obstruct it also got contaminated with it.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,523
The only way one can really understand

36
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:55,341
what we are is by knowing yourself.

37
00:03:55,896 --> 00:04:00,329
When you know yourself you are surprised that

38
00:04:00,957 --> 00:04:05,938
what is the greatest thing for you is to love and to be loved.

39
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:10,586
 You enjoy that collective love so much

40
00:04:10,872 --> 00:04:16,823
 when you are absolutely overcome

41
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:24,043
 your baser self. In Sahaja Yoga it is so simple.

42
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:26,731
It works in a very simple manner.

43
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:34,920
 It's very Sahaja, but to grow into it is very important,

44
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:39,292
and I am so very happy to see so many of you

45
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:44,923
 from all over the world, from Delhi and also from all over India,

46
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:48,811
 enjoying that love among yourselves

47
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:52,335
and understanding among yourselves.

48
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:58,183
I never expected that in My lifetime

49
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,205
I'll be able to see all this beautiful

50
00:05:01,793 --> 00:05:05,856
world of love, trust and peace.

51
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:10,523
 But today really I must say it shows

52
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:14,821
 what we are capable of doing.

53
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:23,501
 We human beings, so-called, are very selfish, self-centered

54
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:27,548
and only worried about ourselves:

55
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:32,657
that is what is said; but it's surprising

56
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:37,329
 that with Self-Realization, with self-knowledge,

57
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:42,808
 with knowing yourself, you understand how rich you are within,

58
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:47,647
 how great you are within and how capable you are.

59
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:50,890
 This understanding comes to you,

60
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:55,887
 and then that is expressed in such a beautiful manner.

61
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:02,497
Sahaja Yoga took time to grow, slowly and slowly,

62
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:09,726
 and that you all have slowly and slowly grown also.

63
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:16,233
 But today I must say that it has reached such a height

64
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:22,273
that it's difficult for people to get out of it.

65
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:27,857
 When you know yourself, when you know what is reality

66
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:30,497
and what is absolute truth,

67
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:34,966
you just get dissolved into that knowledge.

68
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:42,615
 Of course you are not knowledgeable in the way people are;

69
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:47,351
you are knowledgeable in the real sense of the word,

70
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:54,742
because you realize what is within you is a big power of love.

71
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:58,694
There's a big power of understanding.

72
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:04,438
 There's a big power of understanding,

73
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:09,295
 a big power of oneness, of collective.

74
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:13,160
This collectivity works wonders

75
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:17,239
and gives such joy that we are all one,

76
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:22,722
 we have no enemies, we have no problems.

77
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:26,935
 We are all one together.

78
00:07:56,135 --> 00:08:01,501
 This joy that was expressed by you

79
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:10,432
 is like the waves that go to the shores,

80
00:08:11,202 --> 00:08:15,907
touch the shores and come back, creating beautiful patterns.

81
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:18,758
And I see that happening now,

82
00:08:19,117 --> 00:08:24,677
that these beautiful patterns are showing in your own life,

83
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,060
 in your lifestyle, in your behavior.

84
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:34,323
There is a very special type of human race is sitting before Me.

85
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:44,403
 I am so much thankful to you, absolutely,

86
00:08:45,093 --> 00:08:53,669
that you should take to this simple knowledge of yourself

87
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:57,243
and enjoy it with others.

88
00:08:57,507 --> 00:09:03,337
 It's something remarkable that you know about yourself,

89
00:09:03,925 --> 00:09:06,813
that's only human beings can do.

90
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:10,290
 There can be a diamond, very expensive,

91
00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:12,795
 but it doesn't know its value.

92
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:17,447
There could be some dog or some animal

93
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:20,809
which must be something par excellence,

94
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,730
but he doesn't know what he is.

95
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:27,614
Same thing happens with the human beings

96
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:30,542
till they get their Self-Realization,

97
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:37,809
 and after Realization they suddenly become aware of what they are.

98
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:44,680
 And then suddenly they become very humble, they become very loving.

99
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,707
Now supposing if somebody knows that he is a king,

100
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:54,773
 or he discovers that he is a some great musician or a

101
00:09:55,066 --> 00:10:00,985
 prime minister or something: he feels very aloof

102
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:04,639
and he thinks no end of himself.

103
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:08,567
 But by this knowledge that you have,

104
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:13,927
 you become one with the rest of Sahaja Yogis and enjoy it.

105
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,868
 It's very remarkable how it works out

106
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:21,530
 that you enjoy each other so much,

107
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:26,544
and to do something for this collective work,

108
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:30,682
you can dedicate yourself to it.

109
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:37,499
Now My experience of seventy-seven years, as you can say,

110
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:42,029
 has been really checkered with all kinds of incidents,

111
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:46,737
all kinds of people, all kinds of incidents.

112
00:10:47,402 --> 00:10:52,255
And it's a good vision to see

113
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:56,149
 before your eyes that despite all that,

114
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,681
so many beautiful lotuses have come out,

115
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:05,674
 and they are so fragrant, so beautiful,

116
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:08,889
 so colorful, so attractive.

117
00:11:09,971 --> 00:11:17,479
 All this is because we have a innate  value system,

118
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:23,085
 because we have inborn within us a great

119
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:30,797
 sense of love and compassion.

120
00:11:31,552 --> 00:11:36,470
 This compassion has to be really

121
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,904
understood and enjoyed, and jump in the ocean of compassion.

122
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:48,164
So beautiful, and you'll be amazed to see

123
00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:51,338
 that automatically you'll swim,

124
00:11:51,664 --> 00:11:56,632
automatically you'll meet other people also in the same ocean,

125
00:11:56,985 --> 00:12:00,797
 and without any problems, without any troubles,

126
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:07,856
 all enjoying the bliss of this love,
 this compassion, this Divine love.

127
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:14,917
 I must really congratulate

128
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:20,369
 the Delhi people for coming up so well

129
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:27,235
with this beautiful arrangement  and this beautiful pendal,

130
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:33,180
and all the beautiful arrangements
they have made outside for your stay.

131
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:36,077
 I mean really it's something,

132
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:41,381
 I have done nothing for it, nothing, I should say.

133
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:45,222
How these people have worked together:

134
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:48,611
 there have been no quarrels, fighting,

135
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:52,700
 backbiting, nothing of the kind. It's very surprising

136
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:56,788
 that such a beautiful thing has been created by them:

137
00:12:57,114 --> 00:13:00,953
 shows their maturity in Sahaja Yoga.

138
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:04,777
 I must congratulate them again and again

139
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:07,578
for doing this great work

140
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:10,617
in such a short time.

1
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:14,163
First I talked in English because

2
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:16,887
here many people have come from foreign countries

3
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:19,348
and you don't have any objection

4
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:22,142
that I talk in English for a little while.

5
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:26,883
Although it is a great thing of Dehlites

6
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:32,438
and along with them the people of Uttarpradesh also joined.

7
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:40,120
People of Rajasthan also joined and the people from Haryana also helped.

8
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:44,238
All of them have collectively made with love this

9
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:47,726
very beautiful pandal like a temple.

10
00:13:48,124 --> 00:13:53,525
On seeing it I was Myself surprised

11
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:57,810
that here are such talented artists.

12
00:13:57,835 --> 00:13:59,768
I didn't know.

13
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:02,433
Wherefrom this art came?

14
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:08,232
How did they make it and decorate all this, I can't understand.

15
00:14:08,257 --> 00:14:14,716
I didn't know that there are artists of such caliber in our country

16
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:17,434
and that too caliber of love.

17
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:21,873
The power of 'love' and the art of 'love'

18
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:25,633
the art of loving everybody

19
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:30,605
whosoever will get it, he only can do such an artistic composition.

20
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,617
One should learn this art

21
00:14:33,642 --> 00:14:41,472
how can we with the help of our speech, mind and wisdom

22
00:14:41,497 --> 00:14:46,283
become artists, artists of 'love'

23
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:51,011
and how can we give comfort to others

24
00:14:51,036 --> 00:14:53,874
and joy to others.

25
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:58,664
Which lovable talk is such that we can do.

26
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,964
One it is with the help of speech

27
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:05,577
then with wisdom how can we think?

28
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:10,184
How can we shower our love among people?

29
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:17,324
How can we open our heart in front of others

30
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,990
and establish them in our heart?

31
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:28,316
And we should think that the heart which doesn't have love

32
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:32,494
he is not an authority of anything in the world.

33
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:39,197
Because whatever he gets, he cannot be contented in any way with that

34
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:41,622
he cannot get contentment.

35
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:47,903
But when there is an ocean of contentment within you

36
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:52,872
what is it that cannot content you?

37
00:15:52,897 --> 00:16:00,087
When it happens within you and you get the solution

38
00:16:00,304 --> 00:16:08,251
then, nobody can understand the boundries of that solution

39
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,295
that nobody can understand this business.

40
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,053
Such melodious and such beautiful all that happens

41
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:19,254
you cannot overlook it.

42
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:24,983
Can't understand what i am doing and what others are doing

43
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:27,833
what they are saying and what i am saying.

44
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:33,552
And how are they covering me with their love

45
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:41,322
and how shall we shower them with our love.

46
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:43,933
Day and night the same worry goes on

47
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,566
that today whom I have to meet

48
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,512
and what loving things should I tell them.

49
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:54,395
What useful things should be talked about.

50
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,462
Because the practice of talking about useless things

51
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:01,058
leads only to loss.

52
00:17:01,264 --> 00:17:02,958
It has never been useful

53
00:17:03,268 --> 00:17:08,248
and more than that the anger that is there in a human being

54
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:11,410
leads to all the more complications.

55
00:17:12,088 --> 00:17:17,052
There was no need to teach you not to do violence

56
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:21,254
don't treat anyone badly

57
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:23,807
don't destroy anyone

58
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:25,676
don't grab somebody's money.

59
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:27,585
There is no need to teach all this.

60
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,314
You became so dignified on your own.

61
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:35,618
I said now you too have become lotuses

62
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:38,968
that you know to give only your fragrance

63
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:41,009
and don't know anything else.

64
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:44,715
And the joy of giving to others

65
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:51,192
and to feel its joy is a strange experience.

66
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:55,331
Only people of unique character can do it.

67
00:17:55,356 --> 00:17:59,531
Now you are the masters of it

68
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:05,269
and the heritage that we had kept with you

69
00:18:05,532 --> 00:18:08,511
you have utilized fully.

70
00:18:08,536 --> 00:18:10,931
Now that thing is open to everyone

71
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,122
it didn't harm anyone.

72
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:14,666
Now it is a matter of enjoyment.

73
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:20,046
Many people in the world are of different types

74
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:22,747
but they cannot touch you

75
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,563
cannot bother you.

76
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:30,889
Even if there can be something, that too may be absorbed by you.

77
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:32,489
let them join you.

78
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:35,058
Watching your lifestyle

79
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:41,273
let them have atleast the inclination to change their life.

80
00:18:41,528 --> 00:18:43,217
Let us also change.

81
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:44,662
I don't say that

82
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:48,947
I have signed the contract of changing this whole world

83
00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:52,743
but you can sign this contract.

84
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:55,419
If you will change this world

85
00:18:55,444 --> 00:19:01,369
If you invite moral, kind and gentle people

86
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:07,571
there is no need to do anything more.

87
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,196
then you go on looking at it.

88
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:16,771
The only important thing is that you get attatched to it

89
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:22,200
Get engaged into it and find out how many people can we transform?

90
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:27,014
I agree that an ordinary man has got a number of flaws.

91
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:32,006
A man full of flaws you can

92
00:19:32,031 --> 00:19:40,017
very beautifully give knowledge of a good and unknown self

93
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:42,096
the self within us.

94
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:48,280
When you come into contact with the spirit inside us

95
00:19:49,597 --> 00:19:53,561
you come to know that others too must do so.

96
00:19:53,586 --> 00:19:54,935
know yourself all the more.

97
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,456
They are lost.

98
00:19:56,481 --> 00:20:01,430
They don't know how much prime wealth they have inside them.

99
00:20:01,513 --> 00:20:03,897
So, they must be given it

100
00:20:03,922 --> 00:20:06,794
and they must get it.

101
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:10,303
When such conversations will start taking place

102
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:13,341
you will take its responsibility on your ownself

103
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,186
that we too should give others this prime wealth.

104
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:20,945
Their keys are with you

105
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:28,284
and if you somehow give this great contribution

106
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:32,620
just watch how they will recognize you

107
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:36,733
and how they will be greatful to you.

108
00:20:37,225 --> 00:20:39,975
The greatest work for you now is that

109
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,541
you bring as many people as you can to Sahaja state

110
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:46,849
and give them this wealth

111
00:20:46,874 --> 00:20:51,466
and when this will happen

112
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:54,152
you will yourself get busy and be happy

113
00:20:54,183 --> 00:21:01,524
and a type of joy which cannot be described

114
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,708
you will get.

115
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,021
This has to be done.

116
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:08,526
Today you have celebrated My Birthday.

117
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:13,958
I should say a lot of thanks for that

118
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:16,982
and you have done all this joyfully

119
00:21:17,244 --> 00:21:24,127
but for Me it is so that every year Sahajyoga has been spreading

120
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:29,292
and even I too cannot understand its boundries.

121
00:21:29,515 --> 00:21:33,479
But today you too must take a decision

122
00:21:33,504 --> 00:21:41,901
that on the birthday of Mother we will try to transform others.

123
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,730
Our transformation has already been done but must do of others as well.

124
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:51,970
This only  will give you complete contentment of this joy.

125
00:21:51,995 --> 00:21:54,595
Till now the joy you have is limited

126
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,069
when you will distribute it among others

127
00:21:57,094 --> 00:21:59,798
and when it will be echoed in others

128
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:07,080
when you will come to know about it, understand it

129
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:15,656
a great new joy will awaken within yourself.

130
00:22:15,681 --> 00:22:24,924
I was watching your young boys, children dancing joyfully.

131
00:22:25,675 --> 00:22:31,099
Krishna got celebrated Holi so that everybody get joy.

132
00:22:31,124 --> 00:22:37,015
Shri Ram's style made a human being very serious type.

133
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,480
His life became serious.

134
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:42,655
He (Shri Krishna) devised a method so that a human being

135
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,664
 cound open up himself and play mirthfully.

136
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:50,052
Now that thing only Sahajyogis can do practically

137
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:54,889
can play Holi with love amongst themselves.

138
00:22:54,914 --> 00:22:58,333
Not to trouble others

139
00:22:58,358 --> 00:23:04,748
but to express their own joy and to make feel others joyous as well.

140
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:07,946
Eternal blessings to everyone.
