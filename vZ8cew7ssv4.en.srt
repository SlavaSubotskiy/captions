1
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:01,037
Some of you cannot sit on the ground

2
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:05,386
Can be some chairs from inside.

3
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:55,548
Today, we have to something about the connection

4
00:21:55,749 --> 00:22:00,407
of Sahaja Yoga with this Mother Earth.

5
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:02,407
It is very important,

6
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:07,717
that we must understand the value of the Mother Earth.

7
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:10,571
She has been very kind to all of you,

8
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:13,368
She has been sucking your vibrations.

9
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:16,248
She has been, otherwise also,

10
00:22:16,449 --> 00:22:21,568
She has given you everything that you see around.

11
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:29,091
So today, we have to understand the connection,

12
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:34,614
and the symbolic expression of the Mother Earth within ourselves.

13
00:22:34,815 --> 00:22:38,458
I have told you before also that

14
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:42,060
Kundalini, which is in three and a half coils

15
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:49,042
is placed within a triangular bone.

16
00:22:49,378 --> 00:22:56,036
Now this abode of the Kundalini is called as Mooladhara,

17
00:22:56,237 --> 00:23:03,458
and is represented in the universe as this Mother Earth.

18
00:23:05,495 --> 00:23:08,513
Or in the puja, it is represented as the Kumbha.

19
00:23:08,714 --> 00:23:11,714
I don’t know if you have made the Kumbha or not? Have you?

20
00:23:11,915 --> 00:23:16,440
Yes. The Kumbha is it here.

21
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:30,569
So far, in the movement of our consciousness,

22
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:40,193
we have been trying to understand the God Almighty

23
00:23:40,394 --> 00:23:47,256
and all other five elements that we call as important.

24
00:23:57,346 --> 00:24:01,605
And also,

25
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:05,558
the consciousness has been moving

26
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:12,175
towards the understanding of

27
00:24:12,376 --> 00:24:17,985
all the other four elements but the Mother Earth.

28
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,230
That had to be such, because unless and until

29
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:28,964
the understanding of all these four other elements

30
00:24:29,165 --> 00:24:32,495
are brought to a certain degree,

31
00:24:32,696 --> 00:24:35,401
the Mother Earth cannot express itself.

32
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:39,956
Like if all your chakras, four chakras, are caught up,

33
00:24:40,157 --> 00:24:42,940
you cannot raise the Kundalini,

34
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:45,932
you cannot give Self-Realization.

35
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:50,346
You cannot have a mass evolutionary process done.

36
00:24:50,547 --> 00:24:54,955
That’s why we had yagyas,

37
00:24:55,156 --> 00:25:00,564
all other methods of exciting the four elements.

38
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,587
They worshipped the water

39
00:25:03,788 --> 00:25:10,616
and they worshipped air, the sky, the firmament, the light.

40
00:25:13,321 --> 00:25:16,639
And that’s how they came up to the time of Christ

41
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,050
where light was worshipped.

42
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:29,702
But today when we are in this modern Sahaja Yoga,

43
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,015
we are actually at the level of the Mother Earth,

44
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:35,804
because this is the age of the Aquarius.

45
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:40,671
And Aquarius is the same as the Kumbha—

46
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,546
is the Mother Earth.

47
00:25:43,747 --> 00:25:48,715
So we are at the level of the Mother Earth.

48
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,007
You can also see in the consciousness of human beings;

49
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:59,226
I’m saying not only men, but women also and men.

50
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:02,656
The consciousness is moving more towards

51
00:26:02,857 --> 00:26:08,258
the feminine expression of life.

52
00:26:08,459 --> 00:26:10,906
But as stupid as human beings are,

53
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:15,164
the feminists also have been very stupid,

54
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:20,097
that they are fighting on the level of rationality,

55
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:24,933
of economics, of politics—all useless things.

56
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:28,050
Equality on all these things if they are to be sought,

57
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:32,308
you become men, you just become like men.

58
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:35,115
 If you are argumentative, if you are rational,

59
00:26:35,316 --> 00:26:39,435
if you talk like man, it’s a masculine development.

60
00:26:39,636 --> 00:26:42,756
But the Mothers development, the feminine development,

61
00:26:42,957 --> 00:26:48,045
is not equality in the way the men have been stupid.

62
00:26:48,246 --> 00:26:50,967
No use competing with men in their stupidity,

63
00:26:51,168 --> 00:26:53,934
the amount of stupidity has been created already for us

64
00:26:54,135 --> 00:26:56,536
quite sufficiently.

65
00:26:56,737 --> 00:27:00,427
The whole world is today, is expressing that nonsense

66
00:27:00,628 --> 00:27:05,560
that they have—the competition, the aggression, the oppression.

67
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:08,958
So the other side of the woman, which was called as the

68
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:14,488
dominated one, the dark side, the oppressed and all that

69
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:17,118
 has to express itself in a different way.

70
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:21,462
The whole mode, the style, has to change.

71
00:27:21,663 --> 00:27:24,329
See now, in Christianity one should understand;

72
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,352
why Christianity, even Judaism, any religion,

73
00:27:27,553 --> 00:27:30,844
even Hinduism and all that

74
00:27:31,045 --> 00:27:33,795
but its more in Christianity, surprisingly

75
00:27:33,996 --> 00:27:40,170
they just had no place for Mary.

76
00:27:40,371 --> 00:27:46,311
And Muslims even crowned it by completely canceling Fatima.

77
00:27:46,512 --> 00:27:52,209
And on top of that,

78
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:56,693
you will see that among Christians, I think that ordination,

79
00:27:56,894 --> 00:28:00,476
or what you call that, is not given to the . . . to women,

80
00:28:00,677 --> 00:28:05,755
while Christ was not born of a man.

81
00:28:07,505 --> 00:28:10,921
But that does not in any way mean that you compete men

82
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:16,486
in their foolish enterprises by which they have practically

83
00:28:16,687 --> 00:28:20,291
brought this world to such a ruinous state.

84
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:26,518
So today we have to understand that it is the time for

85
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:30,374
the motherly qualities to develop. Even a man,

86
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:33,968
when he becomes motherly only, becomes a great man.

87
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:41,054
Like Christ, when he had compassion, he was called as a saint.

88
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:45,702
So the quality of a woman as a Mother—

89
00:28:45,903 --> 00:28:49,288
Goddess is always as a Mother—

90
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:53,602
and She is the power most important to ignite Sahaja Yoga.

91
00:28:53,803 --> 00:28:56,696
Now how She ignites, I’ll tell you.

92
00:28:56,897 --> 00:29:00,305
I’ll give an analogy, but analogy should not be carried too far—

93
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:04,907
as wise Sahaja Yogis you should not carry it too far.

94
00:29:05,108 --> 00:29:08,251
Say there is a zero, it has no meaning.

95
00:29:08,452 --> 00:29:11,978
In the same way God Almighty has no meaning,

96
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:16,978
till you put some sort of one or two before it.

97
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:20,025
It’s a zero. It has an existence

98
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:24,525
but it has no capacity or a power to express itself.

99
00:29:24,726 --> 00:29:26,119
So it’s a zero.

100
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,807
Like that we should say the masculine growth is a zero.

101
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,557
Another analogy I will give you to understand it.

102
00:29:33,758 --> 00:29:38,995
That if you see

103
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:45,198
very high power wires, going over your head,

104
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:48,998
they are absolutely harmless, there’s no trouble.

105
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:53,059
In Delhi there was a suggestion that there is a very big plot of

106
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,349
available where there are high power wires are going

107
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:02,693
and we can have it for free. I asked "What is the problem?"

108
00:30:02,894 --> 00:30:06,411
They said only, if earth gets connected with that

109
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:10,036
then you will have problem.

110
00:30:10,237 --> 00:30:13,626
So till these-this high power thing, whatever it is—

111
00:30:13,827 --> 00:30:18,306
is not connected with the earth, it has no meaning at all.

112
00:30:18,507 --> 00:30:23,799
But earth is very different from this dynamic power

113
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,549
that is flowing through those wires, which are zero,

114
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,031
which mean nothing.

115
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:37,095
In the same way, in a woman,

116
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:42,811
the womb of a woman is the Kundalini.

117
00:30:43,257 --> 00:30:46,869
Now what is a womb? Now, if that is the Kundalini,

118
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,494
that expresses the Kundalini in the gross;

119
00:30:49,695 --> 00:30:53,908
that means the Mother Earth is also like the womb.

120
00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:57,416
Now what does a womb do?

121
00:30:57,617 --> 00:31:02,236
It receives the sperm,

122
00:31:02,437 --> 00:31:06,454
which is just a frivolous act of man

123
00:31:06,655 --> 00:31:09,938
or you can say just an aggression,

124
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:13,907
and she then nourishes -

125
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:18,446
looks after it, corrects it

126
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:22,993
and allows it to grow, not in an aggressive way

127
00:31:23,194 --> 00:31:27,446
but in a very compassionate and a sensible way,

128
00:31:27,647 --> 00:31:33,865
till it is expelled out of the womb when it is grown up.

129
00:31:35,147 --> 00:31:39,446
So the idea of womb is that the expression has to be

130
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:44,884
in such a manner that it does not dominate.

131
00:31:45,085 --> 00:31:49,056
It does not dominate the embryo.

132
00:31:49,257 --> 00:31:51,697
If it dominates, how can it grow?

133
00:31:51,898 --> 00:31:55,705
So it nourishes it and makes it grow.

134
00:31:55,906 --> 00:31:58,400
This is what today’s Sahaja Yoga is.

135
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:01,681
That now the Mother Earth is the one,

136
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:07,072
who is symbolized within you as the Mooladhara,

137
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:10,986
as symbolized as the AdiShakti here-

138
00:32:11,187 --> 00:32:14,791
is sitting down before you to nourish you,

139
00:32:14,992 --> 00:32:17,963
to make you grow into new personalities—

140
00:32:18,164 --> 00:32:21,796
into mature personalities.

141
00:32:23,117 --> 00:32:27,218
This concept we must understand.

142
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:30,580
So the women of the West must understand

143
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:33,324
that the nonsensical ideas they have taken from men

144
00:32:33,525 --> 00:32:38,769
must be completely discarded. They have to become women first.

145
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:42,558
Those women who just are talking like men,

146
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:46,535
can never help in Sahaja Yoga.

147
00:32:46,736 --> 00:32:51,957
They have to be like this Mother Earth who allows you

148
00:32:52,158 --> 00:32:54,410
to do what you like with Her.

149
00:32:54,611 --> 00:32:57,247
I mean you human beings have been so stupid

150
00:32:57,448 --> 00:33:00,177
to exploit Her to the maximum,

151
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:05,769
not onlyt hat but also She

152
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,926
bears lot of nonsense upon Herself.

153
00:33:09,127 --> 00:33:13,606
But then a time reaches where She becomes explosive,

154
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:18,864
then She starts consuming people inside Herself.

155
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:22,044
And when She is consuming people

156
00:33:22,245 --> 00:33:26,302
then you see the earthquakes and droughts and this and that,

157
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:31,357
all these things start coming in and people get engulfed

158
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:36,232
into these problems

159
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:41,018
which they blame Mother Earth for that.

160
00:33:47,303 --> 00:33:50,235
The problems that human beings have created

161
00:33:50,436 --> 00:33:55,243
out of aggressive nature—even aggression towards the Mother Earth,

162
00:33:55,444 --> 00:34:00,071
they have to pay dividend for that. And they are paying.

163
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:04,266
Now, to stop this kind of a movement of aggressiveness

164
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:07,110
which brings all kinds of disturbances,

165
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:11,243
one has to recede back and should develop

166
00:34:11,444 --> 00:34:16,157
the sense of totality, of compassion.

167
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:20,759
Unless and until, you understand totality,

168
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,087
the total, the complete, the whole—

169
00:34:23,288 --> 00:34:28,415
that’s the womb that’s your Mother.

170
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:31,610
As long as you try to be individualistic

171
00:34:31,811 --> 00:34:36,305
you cannot be a good Sahaja Yogi.

172
00:34:36,506 --> 00:34:40,813
You have to become one with the whole.

173
00:34:41,014 --> 00:34:44,559
Now we have to face ourselves for that, very important it is.

174
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,239
Specially in the west, I would say we have to face ourselves

175
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,427
very clearly—what are we up to?

176
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:55,557
That’s a very important thing.

177
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,557
First of all let us see where is our attention.

178
00:35:03,245 --> 00:35:08,505
Ask a question. We are Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yogis

179
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:13,169
within our fold

180
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:18,427
and I am sometimes surprised that even now,

181
00:35:18,628 --> 00:35:22,815
the attention can be very funny.

182
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:27,935
Like, simple thing, like we can have attention

183
00:35:28,136 --> 00:35:31,792
on material things:

184
00:35:33,152 --> 00:35:38,287
"this is mine-this is yours;

185
00:35:38,488 --> 00:35:41,529
that I should have my privacy." Then you are gone into

186
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,435
the another realm of aggressiveness.

187
00:35:45,636 --> 00:35:47,755
If you try to have your own privacy,

188
00:35:47,956 --> 00:35:55,463
then you are depriving others of their privacy.

189
00:35:56,002 --> 00:35:59,374
It was all right when you were not Sahaja Yogis,

190
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,921
to have your privacy, because you had to grow

191
00:36:02,122 --> 00:36:06,452
in your privacy at that time. But after Sahaja Yoga

192
00:36:06,653 --> 00:36:13,593
you have to become one with everyone else—

193
00:36:13,794 --> 00:36:16,929
that is very important. Before Sahaja Yoga

194
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:22,812
you were different and after Sahaja Yoga you are different.

195
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:27,953
The whole concept must change after Sahaja Yoga.

196
00:36:28,154 --> 00:36:31,086
That now you have become one with the whole

197
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:34,391
and to feel that you are one with the whole,

198
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:39,805
you should try to give up all your individualistic attitudes.

199
00:36:40,006 --> 00:36:47,024
That’s very common now to hear "Yes, I like this, I like that."

200
00:36:48,552 --> 00:36:52,157
It’s very common: "I like it." Very common.

201
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:57,654
But doesn’t behove a Sahaja Yogi to say such a thing.

202
00:36:58,725 --> 00:37:03,766
You see, how can I say that I like some thing?

203
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:09,282
Think of a mother who has to bear the child,

204
00:37:09,483 --> 00:37:14,516
has to give birth to a child, has to look after the child,

205
00:37:14,717 --> 00:37:18,891
the needs of the child, protect the child,

206
00:37:19,092 --> 00:37:21,297
train the child. How can she say:

207
00:37:21,498 --> 00:37:25,802
"I like this" and "I like that"! Where is the time?

208
00:37:26,272 --> 00:37:29,391
To think what you like and what you don’t like,

209
00:37:29,592 --> 00:37:34,938
"I like this food, I like that food". Where is the time?

210
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:38,438
Where is the energy left for that? Where is the attention?

211
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:45,157
The attention is on the upbringing of the child.

212
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,938
Now in the same way a Sahaja Yogi must know that

213
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:56,211
the child within him is born—

214
00:37:56,412 --> 00:37:58,774
the Spirit.

215
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:02,602
Spirit is the child

216
00:38:02,803 --> 00:38:05,422
which has been born within him,

217
00:38:05,623 --> 00:38:10,578
now he has to nourish, through the Kundalini.

218
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:14,875
He has to water it, he has to look after it.

219
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:18,578
It has to make it grow. Now where is the time

220
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:21,867
for other nonsensical things? You have a child in hand.

221
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:27,211
You are all mothers looking after your child—that’s your Spirit.

222
00:38:27,412 --> 00:38:31,203
So where do you have time for all these things?

223
00:38:31,404 --> 00:38:33,172
What attention should be:

224
00:38:33,373 --> 00:38:36,555
"What can I do to make this child happy,

225
00:38:36,756 --> 00:38:40,774
to make this child grow, to make this child

226
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:43,626
completely manifest my self."

227
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:47,165
The mother replaces herself

228
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:51,110
as soon as the child becomes a mature child.

229
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:53,665
So now in you, the Motherhood

230
00:38:53,866 --> 00:38:57,853
must take over than the Fatherhood.

231
00:38:58,054 --> 00:39:01,212
Motherhood towards yourself. The attitude should be

232
00:39:01,413 --> 00:39:04,048
 like a Mother towards the child.

233
00:39:04,249 --> 00:39:06,712
How her attention is towards the child?

234
00:39:06,913 --> 00:39:11,751
You can see in every day-to-day life how we behave.

235
00:39:11,952 --> 00:39:16,478
I have seen people very much interested even now, in food.

236
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:19,189
I mean, where is the time? Where is the attention?

237
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,127
How can you be so much worried about your food?

238
00:39:22,328 --> 00:39:25,197
Worried about your sleep. Worried about your health;

239
00:39:25,398 --> 00:39:29,431
worried about this-that? I mean, here you are to worry about your child

240
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:31,962
which you have got now within.

241
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:35,517
And that’s why the child is neglected and sometimes you find

242
00:39:35,734 --> 00:39:40,749
the child becomes sick or sometimes goes into a coma

243
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:44,538
or may die away also.

244
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:48,749
So the situation is very different now for Sahaja Yogis:

245
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:53,007
"how to treat themselves?"

246
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:56,148
Those who are running after still food

247
00:39:56,349 --> 00:39:59,359
and all these nonsensical things. I mean have seen Sahaja Yogis,

248
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,106
all their attention is on food all the time.

249
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:07,367
How dedication can come in a person

250
00:40:07,568 --> 00:40:12,927
who is so much dedicated to food habits?

251
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:17,859
Like, we have seen,

252
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,468
you might have also seen—some of you—Ajanta caves were built.

253
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:25,257
In ten generations they built Ajanta caves,

254
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:29,663
ten generations! And

255
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:34,272
they built it in a place where there was not even water available—

256
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,280
to begin with.

257
00:40:37,481 --> 00:40:40,374
And day in and day out thousands of people,

258
00:40:40,575 --> 00:40:44,913
without getting any payment, without getting anything, built it.

259
00:40:45,114 --> 00:40:47,015
No food—no question!

260
00:40:47,216 --> 00:40:50,171
They used to eat some fruits somewhere here, there,

261
00:40:50,372 --> 00:40:55,114
but their dedication gave them power to do it.

262
00:40:56,552 --> 00:40:59,226
But this dedication can only be developed

263
00:40:59,427 --> 00:41:05,098
if you realize that you have to Mother your child.

264
00:41:07,637 --> 00:41:12,496
Now if the mother is ugly, the child will be ugly too.

265
00:41:12,697 --> 00:41:16,613
Because it is the mother who is expressed in the child.

266
00:41:16,814 --> 00:41:18,933
She doesn’t dominate the child all right,

267
00:41:19,134 --> 00:41:24,938
but she definitely can corrupt the image of the child.

268
00:41:26,142 --> 00:41:31,777
And that’s what exactly happens when we, the Sahaja Yogis,

269
00:41:31,978 --> 00:41:34,980
are not bothered as to look after our Spirit

270
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:39,805
and our spiritual growth. Even now, you will be surprised,

271
00:41:40,006 --> 00:41:43,594
fifty percent people write letters to Me:

272
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:46,672
"Mother I am still possessed,

273
00:41:46,873 --> 00:41:50,070
I have worked with lemons and chilies,

274
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:53,484
I am coming to you for this and that."

275
00:41:53,685 --> 00:41:56,794
It is a very low-grade business. I think even after so many years

276
00:41:56,995 --> 00:41:59,613
if you are possessed, then I think you should beat yourself

277
00:41:59,814 --> 00:42:02,847
every day hundred and eight times.

278
00:42:03,048 --> 00:42:09,175
It’s a very low grade behavior, I personally think,

279
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:12,738
that after your Mother has worked so hard with you;

280
00:42:12,939 --> 00:42:16,801
you are still just the same, coming back with the

281
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:21,957
horrible idea of bringing

282
00:42:22,158 --> 00:42:27,134
all kinds of problems to your Mother.

283
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:33,450
That means you have not looking after your child.

284
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,723
Now in Sahaja Yoga it’s not a child

285
00:42:36,924 --> 00:42:40,098
which is an individual child you have to look after.

286
00:42:40,299 --> 00:42:45,036
This is, one should understand. This is where we miss very much,

287
00:42:45,237 --> 00:42:48,239
especially by the intellectuals.

288
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,411
They think it is their own child which should be all right,

289
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:56,070
doesn’t matter about others’ children. Or, doesn’t matter

290
00:42:56,271 --> 00:43:00,812
if you have connection with others or not. It’s very common.

291
00:43:01,013 --> 00:43:02,803
Because, in the rationality gives them that sense,

292
00:43:03,004 --> 00:43:05,858
"Oh my spirits are all right, my vibrations are all right,

293
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:08,691
so it is all right if I do not go to puja

294
00:43:08,892 --> 00:43:11,254
or if I do not go to any collective thing

295
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,746
or if I do not support in any collective work

296
00:43:13,947 --> 00:43:18,355
or if I do not take any responsibility of Sahaja Yoga.

297
00:43:18,556 --> 00:43:22,996
Because once you become collective you take responsibilities.

298
00:43:23,197 --> 00:43:27,582
So you are over satisfied with yourself that is good,

299
00:43:27,783 --> 00:43:31,762
that I need not take up any responsibility.

300
00:43:31,963 --> 00:43:35,137
All the Sahaja Yogis are bad, or some of them are bad.

301
00:43:35,338 --> 00:43:40,614
I have nothing to do with them and this is that and that and that.

302
00:43:40,815 --> 00:43:46,994
But in Sahaja Yoga as it is, the Motherhood is universal.

303
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:56,066
Because if you are the nose, say then somebody is the eye;

304
00:43:56,267 --> 00:44:02,399
 if you are the ears, somebody is the lips.

305
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,981
So, it is essential for you to understand

306
00:44:08,182 --> 00:44:14,723
that anybody who is a Sahaja Yogi is in trouble,

307
00:44:14,924 --> 00:44:19,067
you are in trouble. Is threat to your growth;

308
00:44:19,268 --> 00:44:22,020
it is a threat to your growth, because it is the Whole that is growing.

309
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:24,872
Of course, those who are absolutely useless

310
00:44:25,073 --> 00:44:29,802
will be thrown away, gradually. That’s what Mother does.

311
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:35,779
They can be thrown away absolutely,

312
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,849
so much far away that they will never return.

313
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,677
But you don’t have to worry about such people,

314
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:45,763
they will be thrown away. They will be given some chances,

315
00:44:45,964 --> 00:44:51,622
some more credits will be given, some graces will be given,

316
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:54,552
but ultimately they will be thrown away. So you don’t have to worry.

317
00:44:54,753 --> 00:44:57,161
But you must worry about the Whole.

318
00:44:57,362 --> 00:45:01,333
And you have to take up the responsibility.

319
00:45:01,534 --> 00:45:05,731
Those who do not take up the responsibility

320
00:45:05,932 --> 00:45:11,317
are not the people who are yet matured their child—

321
00:45:11,518 --> 00:45:14,137
that’s the Spirit.

322
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:17,473
Every type of responsibility that you can take,

323
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:20,957
think of what responsibilities you can take.

324
00:45:21,158 --> 00:45:23,918
That is why most of us have bad Vishuddhis,

325
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,824
because we do not take the responsibilities,

326
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:29,871
and whatever responsibility we do take

327
00:45:30,072 --> 00:45:34,355
we have to be much, much, much more responsible

328
00:45:34,556 --> 00:45:39,985
than ordinary government servants are.

329
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,538
Sometimes we hear from one ear and throw it away from the same—

330
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:50,856
don’t even allow it to come into the head.

331
00:45:54,153 --> 00:46:00,866
So, one has to understand that the child is your responsibility,

332
00:46:01,067 --> 00:46:03,179
you have to look after the child.

333
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:08,762
And the Whole is also your responsibility.

334
00:46:10,013 --> 00:46:15,914
Now, how to establish the connection between your Spirit,

335
00:46:16,115 --> 00:46:20,797
or keep the connection on between the Spirit and the womb,

336
00:46:20,998 --> 00:46:24,621
or the Kundalini,

337
00:46:24,822 --> 00:46:27,488
is the biggest problem that we all face:

338
00:46:27,689 --> 00:46:30,480
that our connections are very loose

339
00:46:30,681 --> 00:46:37,806
and that’s why this Kundalini cannot look after the Spirit.

340
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:41,964
I wonder if you have noticed one thing in Sahaja Yoga,

341
00:46:42,165 --> 00:46:47,805
that you can maneuver the Kundalini, but not the Spirit.

342
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,780
You can raise your hand, the Kundalini will move.

343
00:46:52,981 --> 00:46:54,936
You can maneuver it.

344
00:46:55,137 --> 00:46:58,702
You can give it a bandhan, it will go round and round and round.

345
00:46:58,903 --> 00:47:02,405
But what about the Spirit?

346
00:47:02,606 --> 00:47:04,928
You cannot maneuver it.

347
00:47:05,129 --> 00:47:07,930
There is only one mantra to awaken the Spirit,

348
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:12,344
in the sense that to please him you have to say you are the Spirit.

349
00:47:12,545 --> 00:47:15,687
But you cannot maneuver it. You have to bring in Kundalini

350
00:47:15,888 --> 00:47:19,578
to look after it, you have to take Kundalini there,

351
00:47:19,779 --> 00:47:25,133
to the heart, so that this child

352
00:47:25,334 --> 00:47:29,133
which is the little offspring just now

353
00:47:29,334 --> 00:47:35,943
has to be carefully developed and matured.

354
00:47:38,383 --> 00:47:42,785
So on both the sides, of men or women,

355
00:47:42,986 --> 00:47:48,816
we have to understand, that if you are a man,

356
00:47:49,017 --> 00:47:54,004
and if you are dominating man, it’s all right.

357
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,559
But if you are a woman and if you are dominating,

358
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,747
then it’s a difficult thing for Sahaja Yoga to cure you,

359
00:47:59,948 --> 00:48:02,435
because you have lost your quality of being a woman.

360
00:48:02,636 --> 00:48:05,466
At least you have to be a woman to begin with.

361
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:08,309
If you are not even a woman, then what can you do with

362
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:13,447
this third persons who are neither man nor woman?

363
00:48:14,049 --> 00:48:17,220
Now the men, when they are dominating, they have to understand,

364
00:48:17,421 --> 00:48:20,892
that they have to be compassionate.

365
00:48:21,093 --> 00:48:25,181
They have to be kind,

366
00:48:25,382 --> 00:48:31,392
they have to be considerate, but never subservient,

367
00:48:31,593 --> 00:48:35,448
never subservient. This is one should understand,

368
00:48:35,649 --> 00:48:38,831
that you should not be subservient.

369
00:48:39,032 --> 00:48:41,964
Now the women, what they have to be;

370
00:48:42,165 --> 00:48:46,777
is to be great, large, receptive;

371
00:48:46,978 --> 00:48:49,816
receiving

372
00:48:50,017 --> 00:48:53,188
and nourishing all that.

373
00:48:54,673 --> 00:48:58,143
Now the way husbands are told sometimes in this West—

374
00:48:58,344 --> 00:49:01,476
I am shocked.

375
00:49:02,547 --> 00:49:05,846
Wife says this to Mr. X, "X you haven’t done this,

376
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,221
X you haven’t done that. How have you put this?

377
00:49:08,422 --> 00:49:12,330
Do this, do that, do that." It’s not woman’s way of doing it,

378
00:49:12,531 --> 00:49:16,857
it’s absolutely wrong that to do it.

379
00:49:17,058 --> 00:49:20,446
To tell him to do something.

380
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:24,235
You are becoming a manly, and then we lose completely

381
00:49:24,436 --> 00:49:32,778
that power of giving that nourishment of a woman’s love,

382
00:49:32,979 --> 00:49:35,645
which is the power of a woman,

383
00:49:35,846 --> 00:49:39,575
which women don’t understand. I’ll tell you a simple example;

384
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:43,590
My own grand daughter. She wants to be an air hostess all the time, she wants.

385
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:46,168
She says, "You must have also thought of being an air hostess."

386
00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:48,621
I said, "Why? What is so great about air hostess?"

387
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:54,290
She says, “That’s the only time you can give food to someone.”

388
00:49:55,838 --> 00:50:01,520
You see a natural instinct of a Mother that let me see them eat, you see.

389
00:50:01,721 --> 00:50:06,627
They don’t eat themselves, they want others to eat.

390
00:50:07,776 --> 00:50:11,513
But this is not in the conception of the western women, I tell you.

391
00:50:11,714 --> 00:50:13,451
They can’t understand this.

392
00:50:13,652 --> 00:50:16,646
"Why? I have done this, so why not he does this, this."

393
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,373
It’s your privilege to do these things properly,

394
00:50:20,574 --> 00:50:21,967
in a proper way.

395
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:25,115
But supposing somebody is a very good mechanic,

396
00:50:25,316 --> 00:50:28,373
the woman will also become a mechanic, "I’ll do the mechanical things".

397
00:50:28,574 --> 00:50:30,568
She is not there for doing mechanical work.

398
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:36,706
She is there for the mechanics of the emotions.

399
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:40,161
On the contrary she just does the other way round.

400
00:50:40,362 --> 00:50:42,224
Like a man comes home; she goes on ordering,

401
00:50:42,425 --> 00:50:45,333
"You have to put that right, why did you spoil my carpet?

402
00:50:45,534 --> 00:50:49,747
Why did you do this? Clean it up, get that thing, do that."

403
00:50:49,948 --> 00:50:55,098
All his mechanics of emotions are finished.

404
00:50:55,299 --> 00:50:57,954
Once his mechanics of emotions are finished,

405
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:01,629
he is useless and you are useless as it is.

406
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:06,798
And men also should not do their jobs. Let them do their own jobs.

407
00:51:07,385 --> 00:51:12,114
I think this is one of the biggest problems of the West today.

408
00:51:12,315 --> 00:51:18,442
That men are neither men, and women are not women.

409
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:21,583
I find the quality so horrid,

410
00:51:21,784 --> 00:51:25,208
that I don’t know how to deal with the mixtures.

411
00:51:25,409 --> 00:51:29,903
You must understand this very simple thing in life

412
00:51:30,104 --> 00:51:33,208
that if you are a hybrid stuff,

413
00:51:33,409 --> 00:51:36,903
you can’t have the quality of a Sahaja Yogi.

414
00:51:37,104 --> 00:51:40,067
If you mix it up, it’s a very funny thing, isn’t it?

415
00:51:40,268 --> 00:51:43,915
So a woman must try to be a woman

416
00:51:44,116 --> 00:51:46,438
and a man must try to be a man.

417
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:53,382
Now see, what is the situation, of a man,

418
00:51:53,583 --> 00:52:02,358
as a masculine effect on the development of consciousness?

419
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,491
So, as the manliness was expressed

420
00:52:06,692 --> 00:52:10,434
we have developed science.

421
00:52:11,247 --> 00:52:14,694
We have developed all this knowledge,

422
00:52:14,895 --> 00:52:18,546
all these things which are outside.

423
00:52:18,747 --> 00:52:21,726
Now everything is ready.

424
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:24,519
Now the woman has to come up.

425
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,503
I mean, I am saying in the very abstract way; don’t think of woman,

426
00:52:27,704 --> 00:52:29,776
but you can say the feminine.

427
00:52:29,977 --> 00:52:33,854
The feminine nature has to rise now.

428
00:52:34,078 --> 00:52:38,197
Now everything is ready, it has to just spark.

429
00:52:39,688 --> 00:52:43,947
All the chakras are ready, now awaken the Kundalini.

430
00:52:44,148 --> 00:52:49,595
Kundalini is as important as the other chakras are.

431
00:52:49,804 --> 00:52:52,876
So now awaken the Kundalini. Now Kundalini’s behavior

432
00:52:53,077 --> 00:52:55,587
and mode of action is very different

433
00:52:55,788 --> 00:53:00,592
from the mode of action of the chakras.

434
00:53:03,939 --> 00:53:07,494
If the Kundalini becomes the chakras and the chakras become the Kundalini,

435
00:53:07,695 --> 00:53:12,589
how will you manage Sahaja Yoga? But we must assume

436
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:16,753
our own nature in all dignity and in all pride;

437
00:53:16,954 --> 00:53:20,855
not to feel any way low down. Because a man sits on a horse,

438
00:53:21,056 --> 00:53:24,300
the woman wants to sit on a horse.

439
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:27,777
What is the need for a woman to sit on a horse,

440
00:53:27,978 --> 00:53:30,668
I can’t understand. Here all the women are sitting on a horse.

441
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:33,082
They’ll become like horses.

442
00:53:33,283 --> 00:53:37,871
Already I think half of your royal family looks like horses,

443
00:53:38,072 --> 00:53:40,816
don’t they?

444
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:44,308
I think so. Their faces look like horses.

445
00:53:44,509 --> 00:53:47,066
See, so there is no need for women to do

446
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:50,659
all the things that man have already done. Say, for example,

447
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,159
there’s one personality of masculine personality that has to come

448
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,776
and do a certain job. Now you’ve done it.

449
00:53:58,977 --> 00:54:01,540
All right now the another personality has to do this job.

450
00:54:01,741 --> 00:54:05,681
Now see the situation of the Divine also.

451
00:54:05,882 --> 00:54:08,498
Now the whole complication comes in that

452
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:11,592
once a kind of a thing has been done,

453
00:54:11,793 --> 00:54:15,748
the another one that comes wants to do the same.

454
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:18,068
Do you follow My point?

455
00:54:18,269 --> 00:54:23,136
So the whole energy is completely wasted.

456
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:26,292
The whole preparation has been made

457
00:54:26,493 --> 00:54:29,206
for this Aquarius age to come in

458
00:54:29,407 --> 00:54:31,874
to bring in the Kundalini upward

459
00:54:32,075 --> 00:54:34,276
and to make the whole work out

460
00:54:34,477 --> 00:54:37,096
in such way that the left and right meet

461
00:54:37,297 --> 00:54:43,479
and you all become ignited enlightened

462
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:50,815
It was a question of our being sharing the whole job

463
00:54:51,016 --> 00:54:52,831
in a proper understanding

464
00:54:53,032 --> 00:54:55,019
Now see how Mother Earth Herself was created,

465
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,707
it is also a very simple thing

466
00:54:57,908 --> 00:55:06,159
First, the movement of the energy started flowing.

467
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,425
Now this is a combined energy all right?

468
00:55:09,626 --> 00:55:14,034
Then the combined energy went round and round and round like that.

469
00:55:14,235 --> 00:55:19,018
And when it consolidated there was a-this big bang.

470
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:22,635
When big bang took place—now this is the manly work,

471
00:55:22,836 --> 00:55:25,182
I should say in a way; manly style,

472
00:55:25,383 --> 00:55:28,745
because still the Mother earth is not produced—

473
00:55:28,946 --> 00:55:34,206
so then these little fragments again went round and round.

474
00:55:34,407 --> 00:55:36,503
With the momentum, they became roundish.

475
00:55:36,704 --> 00:55:39,847
Out of them the Mother Earth was selected for one job.

476
00:55:40,048 --> 00:55:42,644
Not to do anything - you keep quiet now.

477
00:55:42,845 --> 00:55:50,620
Alright. On the Mother Earth out of the water came the life—

478
00:55:50,821 --> 00:55:53,558
the carbon came in.

479
00:55:53,759 --> 00:55:57,878
Everybody helped there and a human being was created.

480
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:01,155
Then the men went round, to improve their societies

481
00:56:01,356 --> 00:56:03,811
and whatever they have done to it, whatever was possible

482
00:56:04,012 --> 00:56:06,700
with their ego is done, finished now.

483
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:12,185
Now they have done their job, you see. Now they are on dole,

484
00:56:12,386 --> 00:56:14,638
you can say.

485
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:19,685
Now the womb, or we can say the Kundalini

486
00:56:19,886 --> 00:56:22,521
which has been waiting all these years, was resting,

487
00:56:22,722 --> 00:56:25,154
waiting for that time, isn’t it? So we call it:

488
00:56:25,355 --> 00:56:27,506
"the blossom time has now come".

489
00:56:27,707 --> 00:56:33,678
At that time the Kundalini has to rise and ignite,

490
00:56:33,879 --> 00:56:38,231
in such a way that the completion of the whole work takes place—

491
00:56:38,432 --> 00:56:42,486
it is simple. Do you understand now?

492
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,521
So there’s no competition between men or women,

493
00:56:47,722 --> 00:56:51,513
but the style of work is different.

494
00:56:51,714 --> 00:56:56,005
If you understand that, then only this kind of revolution

495
00:56:56,206 --> 00:56:58,505
will take place and not turn out a rebellion.

496
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:01,739
Actually women are rebelling against men, and a nonsense it is.

497
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,356
It is such a headache, that you create something,

498
00:57:05,557 --> 00:57:08,198
allow them to grow, and the another party comes

499
00:57:08,399 --> 00:57:12,479
which has to complete the job starts rebelling.

500
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,640
So the revolution has to take place and this revolution is only possible

501
00:57:16,841 --> 00:57:23,528
when we understand that what part is left out now to be done.

502
00:57:25,853 --> 00:57:28,941
Are you getting Me all right?

503
00:57:29,142 --> 00:57:33,089
So that part is now Realization,

504
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:36,612
our awakening of the Kundalini.

505
00:57:36,813 --> 00:57:42,081
For that your feminine qualities are going to help you,

506
00:57:42,282 --> 00:57:44,635
not your masculine qualities.

507
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:48,315
So aggressiveness must be given up by men.

508
00:57:48,516 --> 00:57:50,768
Also, because they are Sahaja Yogis now,

509
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:53,940
they have to take feminine qualities. Not of fighting.

510
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:56,831
If women fight they are not women.

511
00:57:57,032 --> 00:58:00,136
You see, women are told that

512
00:58:00,337 --> 00:58:06,988
"you are useless, you are good for nothing",

513
00:58:07,189 --> 00:58:11,636
so now they are trying to show, ‘no’, we are also all right.

514
00:58:11,837 --> 00:58:16,743
If you have eaten one crow we will eat three."

515
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:30,047
Now, this understanding and the wise perception would be such that

516
00:58:30,248 --> 00:58:33,274
"what do we have to do now to change the mode

517
00:58:33,475 --> 00:58:35,805
and the style of our lives?"

518
00:58:36,006 --> 00:58:38,508
What’s wrong here?

519
00:58:38,709 --> 00:58:40,899
A turning point has come.

520
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:48,055
Now the evolution is not rebellion, at all by any chance.

521
00:58:48,256 --> 00:58:51,852
It’s a wrong idea people have. It’s not rebellion,

522
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:54,385
that you hit me and I hit you—go on hitting each other,

523
00:58:54,586 --> 00:58:57,268
like a pendulum you move; you see the movement of a pendulum.

524
00:58:57,469 --> 00:59:01,041
It’s not like a boom, this thing—that today you are born as a Muslim,

525
00:59:01,242 --> 00:59:03,782
tomorrow you are born as a Jew, then you are born as a Jew,

526
00:59:03,983 --> 00:59:06,157
then you are born as a Hindu, then you are born as—

527
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:10,470
it’s not pendulum. It is spiral movement.

528
00:59:10,671 --> 00:59:15,329
So every time you achieve an evolution

529
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:17,517
you are at a higher level than before.

530
00:59:17,718 --> 00:59:21,595
So the movement is spiral—see My point?

531
00:59:21,796 --> 00:59:28,876
Now to achieve the higher position in our whole being

532
00:59:29,077 --> 00:59:31,032
what should we do?

533
00:59:31,233 --> 00:59:34,923
Is to understand that from this point to that point we have to rise—

534
00:59:35,124 --> 00:59:43,000
we have to rise in a way that we move in such a way

535
00:59:43,201 --> 00:59:51,408
that it is not in a pendulum way but in a spiral way.

536
00:59:51,792 --> 00:59:58,771
And to move spirally, you have to use another kind of force.

537
00:59:58,972 --> 01:00:03,591
Whatever you have used so far has to be endowed

538
01:00:03,792 --> 01:00:05,586
with another kind of force

539
01:00:05,787 --> 01:00:08,594
and that’s the feminine qualities of women.

540
01:00:08,795 --> 01:00:12,180
But where are the feminine women?

541
01:00:12,381 --> 01:00:16,336
They dress up like women, they will try to be feminine

542
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:20,805
and all that. That’s not the way. From inside, from the heart.

543
01:00:21,006 --> 01:00:26,672
A feminine heart. Christ showed that in His life—

544
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:30,258
He forgave. Only a woman can forgive, man cannot,

545
01:00:30,459 --> 01:00:34,149
because he is aggressive. How can he forgive?

546
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:38,172
Krishna never forgave anyone. He used to kill.

547
01:00:38,373 --> 01:00:45,826
Right royal fashion, go, all right? if you are so, all right. Done.

548
01:00:46,283 --> 01:00:49,293
He forgave to such an extent to show that

549
01:00:49,494 --> 01:00:54,176
He is now giving a turn to the spiral

550
01:00:54,377 --> 01:00:59,309
and now a feminine quality has to be developed among human beings.

551
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:02,497
But that doesn’t mean that you start walking like women

552
01:01:02,698 --> 01:01:07,448
or developing waistlines.

553
01:01:09,948 --> 01:01:13,013
Because that’s another stupidity.

554
01:01:13,214 --> 01:01:16,513
But to be Motherly.

555
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:20,669
Not to be fatherly, but to be Motherly.

556
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:24,474
That kindness, that gentleness

557
01:01:24,675 --> 01:01:28,544
should be in your behavior towards each other.

558
01:01:28,745 --> 01:01:33,060
Of course this force also corrects, sometimes also gets angry also.

559
01:01:33,261 --> 01:01:35,826
Mother also has to get angry sometimes,

560
01:01:36,027 --> 01:01:39,584
specially with people who never get all right with their behavior,

561
01:01:39,785 --> 01:01:42,123
She has to be shouting, punishing,

562
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:46,607
and sometimes She also destroys; it’s all right.

563
01:01:46,808 --> 01:01:51,683
But that is sometimes, not all the time.

564
01:01:52,636 --> 01:01:58,052
So just now one has to accept that to be like the Mother Earth

565
01:01:58,253 --> 01:02:01,568
we have to be forbearing—Dhara.

566
01:02:01,769 --> 01:02:06,795
Daharaitey sadara. She is the sustenance of everything.

567
01:02:06,996 --> 01:02:11,951
She takes everything, the vibrations are sucked in; see, talk about it.

568
01:02:12,152 --> 01:02:14,717
And now for the first time after Realization,

569
01:02:14,918 --> 01:02:19,537
you can give Her back what you have got it, from Her.

570
01:02:19,738 --> 01:02:21,981
You can give vibrations to Her trees that are created, y

571
01:02:22,182 --> 01:02:26,994
ou can make them beautiful. You can transform a flower

572
01:02:27,222 --> 01:02:30,287
into a more beautiful flower.

573
01:02:30,488 --> 01:02:32,873
Now whatever you have got from the Mother Earth

574
01:02:33,074 --> 01:02:38,053
you can give because your Mother Earth is awakened within you now.

575
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,254
So you return Her back everything that you got from Her

576
01:02:41,547 --> 01:02:46,112
and give it to others. Generosity, the greatness of heart,

577
01:02:46,313 --> 01:02:53,292
nobility, forgiveness, love, affection, bearing everything for love.

578
01:02:53,493 --> 01:02:57,753
And for the mother, to save her child, she’ll starve herself,

579
01:02:57,954 --> 01:03:01,589
she’ll do everything to save her child,

580
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:05,573
complete dedication she has for her child.

581
01:03:05,774 --> 01:03:09,160
That’s a real mother—I mean the kind of mothers you see these days,

582
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:12,104
neither they are mothers nor women. But what I am saying,

583
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:18,336
that’s the real image of a mother, and you have a image before you.

584
01:03:20,416 --> 01:03:23,673
So, this is what one has to develop now,

585
01:03:23,874 --> 01:03:26,657
whether you are men or women as Sahaja Yogis

586
01:03:26,858 --> 01:03:30,837
you must develop a new consciousness of affection,

587
01:03:31,038 --> 01:03:33,962
love and compassion.

588
01:03:34,163 --> 01:03:38,767
Getting angry, getting into a temper, shouting at people,

589
01:03:38,968 --> 01:03:43,423
screaming at people—is not going to help you much.

590
01:03:43,624 --> 01:03:46,212
If you have to help the whole, the growth of the whole,

591
01:03:46,413 --> 01:03:50,720
try to make yourself a milder person—

592
01:03:50,921 --> 01:03:53,993
be angry with yourself that you are losing tempers

593
01:03:54,194 --> 01:03:58,673
and you are so unkind to others.

594
01:03:58,874 --> 01:04:03,564
All the problems have come out of the over-growth of the masculinity—

595
01:04:03,765 --> 01:04:06,127
over-growth. It reaches a certain point, you see,

596
01:04:06,328 --> 01:04:11,632
it’s reached such a wretched point now, that it has to come down.

597
01:04:14,906 --> 01:04:19,332
But also femininity, at a lower level, without Realization

598
01:04:19,533 --> 01:04:24,105
could be very, very small hearted, chicken hearted,

599
01:04:24,306 --> 01:04:28,931
could be all the time worried about her own child.

600
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:32,886
That’s what one has to change—

601
01:04:33,087 --> 01:04:37,949
is to have love and affection for every Sahaja Yogi,

602
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:41,624
for every person. When it comes to fighting others

603
01:04:41,825 --> 01:04:46,226
you are all one but among yourselves you can look after each other,

604
01:04:46,427 --> 01:04:49,820
tell them—say for example, something is paining in my nose here,

605
01:04:50,021 --> 01:04:52,578
I will just try to rub it in the same way.

606
01:04:52,779 --> 01:04:57,984
But I won’t try to cut my nose will I? Or bang my nose, I won’t?

607
01:04:58,185 --> 01:05:03,129
So the feeling that the other is myself; be kind and gentle—

608
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:06,660
try to improve and help in that manner.

609
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,426
I hope you have understood the whole thing.

610
01:05:09,627 --> 01:05:13,315
In a nutshell is that: we have to change the whole mode—

611
01:05:13,516 --> 01:05:18,417
a radical change has to come in the society of Sahaja Yogis.

612
01:05:18,618 --> 01:05:23,899
Now, if there is any question you ask Me, before we start the puja.

613
01:05:26,118 --> 01:05:31,109
Now the problem of divorce and all that, you can see this.

614
01:05:42,217 --> 01:05:47,474
Left Nabhi problema, we can talk to.

615
01:06:14,973 --> 01:06:18,274
What is it?

616
01:06:23,568 --> 01:06:25,888
See.

617
01:06:27,466 --> 01:06:32,578
This problem comes in where you are not the whole.

618
01:06:32,779 --> 01:06:34,578
All right?

619
01:06:34,779 --> 01:06:38,726
Now supposing, as I told you, if you are the whole,

620
01:06:38,927 --> 01:06:42,677
then who is the other?

621
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,952
Then you will, even if you have to hurt. Say, for example,

622
01:06:47,153 --> 01:06:51,140
if there is blood coming out of my thumb,

623
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:55,546
I press it hard to stop the blood. It will hurt the thumb, thing.

624
01:06:55,747 --> 01:06:58,748
But the discrimination must be used, that I'm loosing my blood

625
01:06:58,949 --> 01:07:01,247
which is precious, much more precious than this finger

626
01:07:01,448 --> 01:07:04,666
it will hurt.

627
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:08,223
But that discretion must be achieved, you see.

628
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,317
In Sahaja Yoga, you're all free to develop

629
01:07:10,518 --> 01:07:12,489
your sense of discretion.

630
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:14,578
And once you develop your sense of discretion,

631
01:07:14,779 --> 01:07:17,133
gradually you will know what to do. In the beginning you will hurt,

632
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:19,774
no doubt, because you are used to that.

633
01:07:19,975 --> 01:07:22,391
I've seen people here, just barking at each other,

634
01:07:22,592 --> 01:07:25,586
as soon as they see each other they start barking.

635
01:07:25,787 --> 01:07:27,977
You go anywhere in the whole country you go anywhere,

636
01:07:28,178 --> 01:07:30,196
they start barking for nothing at all. I was surprised.

637
01:07:30,397 --> 01:07:31,618
In a school, I went there,

638
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:34,063
there also everybody is barking at each other, you know.

639
01:07:34,264 --> 01:07:36,868
Whether they are drunk or not drunk, makes no difference-

640
01:07:37,069 --> 01:07:41,711
is the same state. But after Realization, you do say.

641
01:07:41,912 --> 01:07:46,555
Because you feel concerned, you're worried.

642
01:07:46,756 --> 01:07:51,594
But you say in such a way that you achieve the result.

643
01:07:51,795 --> 01:07:54,633
See My point is-that is the criteria:

644
01:07:54,834 --> 01:07:58,693
that you should achieve the results.

645
01:07:59,537 --> 01:08:01,938
But, supposing a man has come for the first time, and tell him

646
01:08:02,139 --> 01:08:04,672
that "you are a bhoot",

647
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:09,000
then naturally he will be hurt;

648
01:08:09,201 --> 01:08:12,701
very common.

649
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:18,016
First day, somebody walks in and you say "you are a bhoot".

650
01:08:18,217 --> 01:08:20,050
I mean, thank God if he doesn't understand the meaning

651
01:08:20,251 --> 01:08:24,586
of the word bhoot -then it's all right.

652
01:08:28,554 --> 01:08:33,681
But first you think of being gentle, nice,

653
01:08:33,882 --> 01:08:38,939
embalming, sweet. Let's see, find out ways and methods;

654
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:42,041
there's a very good way-in the evening, to write down

655
01:08:42,242 --> 01:08:46,609
"how many sweet things I've said today."

656
01:08:51,687 --> 01:08:53,994
Not like this, sweet things we say,

657
01:08:54,195 --> 01:08:57,314
"You're looking beautiful" all that.

658
01:08:57,515 --> 01:09:02,546
Not the superficial ones. That may pamper the ego.

659
01:09:02,882 --> 01:09:05,853
But they're so sweet you know, things are.

660
01:09:06,054 --> 01:09:12,400
Let's say

661
01:09:12,601 --> 01:09:15,220
there are some very good words,

662
01:09:15,421 --> 01:09:19,772
you can say, like-"Are you warm enough?"

663
01:09:20,476 --> 01:09:24,470
-very sweet way of asking a question. Then, it's very simple;

664
01:09:24,671 --> 01:09:26,430
but you can say like that.

665
01:09:26,631 --> 01:09:30,125
Just-it's very difficult for people to say that even, I've seen.

666
01:09:30,326 --> 01:09:33,672
Looking after others comforts. Somebody is sitting, he wants water.

667
01:09:33,873 --> 01:09:37,616
Awkwardly sitting. You just go rush and given him water.

668
01:09:37,817 --> 01:09:43,476
Oh that's too much to expect. That, Oh God you gave water,

669
01:09:43,677 --> 01:09:47,679
"I'm not his servant"-immediately the question comes into the head.

670
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,843
Little bit trying to do something here and there.

671
01:09:52,044 --> 01:09:56,726
Or sometimes thinking-going in the market,

672
01:09:56,927 --> 01:10:00,460
you find something. "Oh let me take it for him".

673
01:10:00,661 --> 01:10:02,793
Children do. I've seen children all the time;

674
01:10:02,994 --> 01:10:09,869
they think of their friends-what they can buy for others.

675
01:10:12,061 --> 01:10:14,110
"This is good for my friend, this is good for..."

676
01:10:14,311 --> 01:10:15,946
She's very fond of things, she "likes. . ."

677
01:10:16,147 --> 01:10:18,493
All these little-little things, you know.

678
01:10:18,694 --> 01:10:20,626
Sometimes even a small thing

679
01:10:20,827 --> 01:10:22,228
like; early in the morning you get up,

680
01:10:22,429 --> 01:10:24,963
you find the another person is sleeping on one side,

681
01:10:25,164 --> 01:10:29,791
his blanket on the third side and his pillow in the fourth side.

682
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:31,750
So you just put his head on the pillow

683
01:10:31,951 --> 01:10:36,242
and cover him with the blanket. That's mother's job.

684
01:10:39,585 --> 01:10:44,538
Not out of fear, but out of sheer love.

685
01:10:46,512 --> 01:10:49,303
Like even if it is cold and buttons are open,

686
01:10:49,504 --> 01:10:53,717
you can button up a person you like. Little-little things you know.

687
01:10:53,918 --> 01:10:56,530
Women have very little-sweet things which they do,

688
01:10:56,731 --> 01:11:02,645
which makes men very happy. But women have lost now, that sense.

689
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:09,289
Not the fighting, but thinking of

690
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:11,797
what sweet things you can do for him.

691
01:11:11,998 --> 01:11:16,130
And also, sometimes teasing is all right.

692
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:21,101
Sometimes tickling is all right.

693
01:11:21,302 --> 01:11:27,593
But a kind of a sweet you see rapport between each other;

694
01:11:27,794 --> 01:11:33,567
even the feeling, that we can do that. It's a master's job.

695
01:11:34,271 --> 01:11:37,229
Is a master's job. The one who is a master can do it,

696
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:39,576
those who are not, will not be able to.

697
01:11:39,777 --> 01:11:42,459
They'll again come back to hurt. Ultimately, they'll land up

698
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:46,225
with hurting or biting or coming to blows.

699
01:11:46,426 --> 01:11:49,374
But those who are masters will be so beautifully doing

700
01:11:49,575 --> 01:11:55,444
the whole job that you see a kind of a very sweet relationship-

701
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,297
it's called Madhurya. Without any lust,

702
01:11:57,498 --> 01:12:02,266
without any money-business, anything. Such sweet relationships.

703
01:12:02,467 --> 01:12:06,771
And the joy would be bubbling.

704
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,649
All these perversions, all these things will drop off.

705
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:15,350
But a very sweet relationship-

706
01:12:20,428 --> 01:12:26,295
all right? Even saying that, you are feeling happy.
