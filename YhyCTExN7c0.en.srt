1
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:11,027
“TIME HAS COME TO BECOME THE SPIRIT”

2
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:28,753
We are here to inform you about a power
which is within us

3
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:36,031
and the power that can give you what is
promised by all the saints,

4
00:00:36,232 --> 00:00:41,365
scriptures and all the incarnations.

5
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:49,797
Today when you see the young people
in every country - especially in the west –

6
00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:56,941
you’ll find they are not satisfied

7
00:00:57,225 --> 00:01:03,464
with their own atmosphere, their lives

8
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:10,850
and they think there is something missing

9
00:01:14,392 --> 00:01:18,746
and they are extremely confused.

10
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:30,610
Now when they are confused they are seeking
for something beyond,

11
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:34,351
something unknown to them.

12
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:44,099
In that seeking, they may take to anything
extreme,

13
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,219
drugs,

14
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:55,266
could be alcoholism,

15
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:08,979
or some other perversions which cause
horrible diseases, incurable diseases.

16
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:26,676
Instead of condemning them

17
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:34,530
we have to see why they are doing all these
things, what is the purpose.

18
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:46,761
Also, some of them went to some gurus

19
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:52,259
which are in the market.

20
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,076
Especially when they see the religious
people and the religions,

21
00:03:07,277 --> 00:03:15,639
they cannot believe that religion can give
such horrid experiences

22
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:30,306
and some of them are anti-God,
anti-religion also.

23
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:44,661
But if you deal with the problems
sympathetically, you cannot blame them,

24
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:50,719
because they are intelligent, aware people.

25
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:04,844
So now we have two category of people,

26
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:11,359
one: the ones who are not seeking at all,

27
00:04:17,732 --> 00:04:28,714
and another are the ones who want to find
out solutions of the problems.

28
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:45,245
In every generation we had people who
revolutionised

29
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:48,436
because they did not like a particular
system,

30
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:54,744
or did not like a particular style of life,
whatever it was.

31
00:04:56,545 --> 00:05:01,378
But now the revolution has to come from
within.

32
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:06,492
We have to evolve from within,

33
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:23,695
because the destruction is also coming from
within.

34
00:05:23,896 --> 00:05:28,316
We are destroying ourselves more from
within.

35
00:05:28,517 --> 00:05:34,145
Because we are so unhappy, so confused,

36
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:41,127
absolutely “quite a percentage” is
schizophrenic.

37
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:49,510
So then we start seeking the solution

38
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:55,204
and in that seeking we make mistakes.

39
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:10,912
And we make mistakes because we do not
know what to seek

40
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:19,760
and how to find,

41
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,890
also how to evolve to that state.

42
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:43,575
So logically we have to reach some
conclusions, logically;

43
00:06:43,776 --> 00:06:49,712
that it has to be some evolutionary
happening.

44
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:57,570
This is logical, to transform ourselves,
there has to be some evolution.

45
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:05,455
So, like Jung has said, that you have
to become collectively conscious.

46
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:10,211
You have to become, it’s an actualization,
it is not just a certificate.

47
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:15,763
It has to become from within, it’s
an honest thing, it’s an innate thing.

48
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:17,985
It is not just a preaching

49
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:24,296
or sort of a giving a certificate - it is
not - or taking a name.

50
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:29,381
It is actualization within yourself,

51
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:36,759
so that something has to happen to us.

52
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:46,877
Now as we have evolved from monkey stage
to this stage, for example,

53
00:07:47,078 --> 00:07:52,420
we’ve done nothing, it is a living process

54
00:07:57,986 --> 00:08:02,204
which has taken place spontaneously.

55
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:27,949
There’s a big resistance to any oriental
ideas being accepted in the West,

56
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,114
big resistance.

57
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:36,522
I find there’s a very big resistance
for any oriental ideas

58
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:43,494
coming to the West.

59
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,686
Now these oriental ideas which are coming

60
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,870
are to be seen with a scientific open mind

61
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:20,192
because the Western life has grown like
a tree outside,

62
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,659
but the roots may be in the East,

63
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:35,278
maybe we can keep ourselves open to see
where are the roots.

64
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:51,094
Now if the roots are in the East,
supposing, it’s an hypothesis,

65
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:58,247
so let us have a look at it, if there is
any solution in those.

66
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:03,228
So you go to oriental ideas.

67
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:09,565
But there also is very dangerous, because
you are going in the unknown,

68
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:16,217
you might go to false gurus, you might go
to wrong people

69
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,804
and get completely destroyed.

70
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:30,645
So, what do we do? First thing we should
know, we cannot pay for our evolution,

71
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:35,127
we cannot pay, money is not there.

72
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:53,840
Nor can we pay for any living process.
Any living process we cannot pay.

73
00:10:55,643 --> 00:11:00,079
Like, if the seed has to sprout, the Mother
Earth will sprout it,

74
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,701
we don’t pay the Mother Earth.

75
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:12,511
Alright. So first thing they should have
known that anybody who asks for money

76
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:18,747
is not a truthful person. No money should
be involved.

77
00:11:20,352 --> 00:11:25,020
Then the second point comes in, that we got

78
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:31,645
to this stage of human awareness
spontaneously,

79
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:37,314
without any effort, effortlessly.

80
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,232
In the same way it should happen.

81
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:58,852
But first of all in every evolution there
has been one leader.

82
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:11,895
We can call them as archetypes as they say,
or whatever you may say -

83
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:19,414
want to say, though Jung was not very clear
on that point.

84
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:29,131
So now such a person can decode
the information

85
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:34,813
of symbols and everything and can help
others,

86
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:43,100
without taking any money, without taking
any gratification; can do it.

87
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:50,762
And here it is that people fumble
in the West,

88
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:56,538
they don’t mind a pope, they don’t mind
an archbishop of Canterbury,

89
00:12:56,739 --> 00:13:03,986
but they do mind a person who is doing
everything free, just out of love.

90
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:12,063
You’ll be amazed in England,

91
00:13:12,264 --> 00:13:15,561
the television people told me, that we
cannot accept anything

92
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:24,183
which does not take money! Can you believe
it, it’s a fact!

93
00:13:24,397 --> 00:13:29,563
In - I think, in Boston or somewhere, they
asked me a question:

94
00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:33,753
“How many Rolls Royces you have got?”

95
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:37,300
This is journalism, I’m just telling you.

96
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:44,738
Then the most important thing which is not
realized by modern mind -

97
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:54,071
that they believe anything new is to be
tried, is a very dangerous thing.

98
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:16,859
If we are dealing with the living process
of evolution, we have to know

99
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:23,876
that in spiritual life whatever is going
to happen

100
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:31,286
must relate to scriptures, to all
the scriptures, must relate to them.

101
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:55,829
Not to one scripture, say, for Holy Bible
or Holy Koran, or any, but to all of them.

102
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:02,985
Because it is like a seed that sprouts,

103
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:11,778
then it becomes the stem, then
the branches, then the leaves,

104
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:16,668
then the flower and then the fruit; living
process,

105
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:22,082
it is based on something, evolves through
something.

106
00:15:22,283 --> 00:15:24,711
But whatever is dead - like we can create
a fruit,

107
00:15:24,912 --> 00:15:28,684
plastic fruit from nowhere just like that,
you see,

108
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:32,592
so which has no basis,

109
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:40,606
has no meaning.

110
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:47,078
It must have a basis from where it has
come, its origin must be seen.

111
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:07,278
As in the growth of the tree all that is
useless drops out,

112
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:11,574
in the same way in evolution also, all that
is useless drops out,

113
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,976
even useless tradition drop out, everything
drops out,

114
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:22,594
but ultimately you reach to the epitome
where you become the fruit.

115
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:33,659
So the time has come for human beings
to become the Spirit.

116
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:39,156
So every seed has “cambry”, alright?
Yogi: Keimling.

117
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:46,810
Shri Mataji: And in the same way within us
is our “camry” is the Kundalini.

118
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:05,321
And this is to be actually awakened,
actually awakened.

119
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,503
Now in Sahaja Yoga we have thousands
of people all over the world.

120
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:15,733
There are people who are – we can call them
the highest in the society,

121
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:21,241
there are people who are the lowest
in the so-called society.

122
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:27,235
All of them are at par with each and every
person,

123
00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:33,553
there is no higher / lower feeling

124
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:37,894
everyone belongs to that society -
(to somebody: It’s alright) -

125
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:42,042
it belongs to that society.

126
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,358
Moreover when this happens -

127
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:57,025
because we understand what these
incarnations were,

128
00:17:57,226 --> 00:18:01,521
the conflict of all religions drops out
like that.

129
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:06,154
We understand it on central nervous system.
The conflict drops out.

130
00:18:06,355 --> 00:18:10,837
There is no question of not worshipping
Christ -

131
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:18,573
Muslims, Jews, Hindus all worship Christ,
they all worship Mohammed Sahib

132
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,959
and they all worship Rama, Krishna,
all these people.

133
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,259
Because actually they see that

134
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,689
when the Kundalini rises, she passes
through certain centers,

135
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:38,345
and there you have to take the name
of those great incarnations.

136
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:41,662
So this is the knowledge of the roots

137
00:18:41,863 --> 00:18:45,560
and one must know that you have to become
a subtler being

138
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:48,332
to understand that knowledge.

139
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:54,019
As a result of Kundalini awakening we can
claim many things.

140
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,660
But that can be seen that cancer can be
cured,

141
00:18:59,861 --> 00:19:03,534
so many incurable physical diseases can be
cured,

142
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:10,436
mental diseases can be cured, drug
addiction can be cured,

143
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:18,700
the problems created by these gurus can be
cured.

144
00:19:20,696 --> 00:19:24,905
All these things can be done when you
become the Spirit,

145
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:31,206
but this should be just at a level
of a hypothesis,

146
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:35,819
when we do it, and it’s proved, then you
should accept; not blindly.

147
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,004
There is no blind faith in Sahaja Yoga.

148
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:47,141
We have no priesthoods, nobody is paid.

149
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:51,174
 It’s a free society,

150
00:20:00,387 --> 00:20:04,960
and everyone becomes very knowledgeable.
