1
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,490
any other question please

2
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:28,620
just be little loudly can you say loudly

3
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,620
please

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,720
looking

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:42,690
why don't we

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:44,580
why you don't like it I said something

7
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,510
here is a question really is something I

8
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,080
can't understand

9
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:52,680
you see if I have something if this

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,230
picture is my true picture then why not

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,379
have it in this picture you will be

12
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,330
surprised the person who first got

13
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,000
realization got through this picture in

14
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,619
this picture there are vibrations when

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,020
you will get realized you will know that

16
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,149
only this picture has such vibrations it

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,250
was a real thing it is thank God the

18
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:13,080
science has given us the real thing if

19
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,560
there were cameras before we would have

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,700
had pictures of all those great people

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,020
because there were no photographs they

22
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,360
said better not have any pictures

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,250
because all the pictures were imaginary

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,729
done by people who wanted to have

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:30,619
someone with this picture

26
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:33,119
many people have been cured all right

27
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:35,580
it's a very good thing that has happened

28
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,950
that we can take pictures now because I

29
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:42,050
think I cannot meet everyone in this

30
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,050
world but they cannot see my picture I

31
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:55,200
do not claim i doing no question of

32
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:59,340
blaming you see I do it have done it you

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:04,250
can do it don't you everyone can be this

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,250
dr. Warren Delta it's not so many people

35
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,709
yes it is surprisingly low myself I was

36
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,510
surprised that you are

37
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,790
that's my photograph has also got

38
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,340
reservations and people get cured before

39
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:20,819
the glass in your country maybe when I

40
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,860
gave the press was very kind to the

41
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,940
reason was there was a lady who was sick

42
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:31,830
with coma as I said she had what love

43
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:33,510
cerebral aneurysm and once another

44
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,670
disciple of mine

45
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:40,020
to fight photogram put it under her head

46
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,630
and she started getting all right in the

47
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,310
sense that she started opening her eyes

48
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,530
so the doctor got frightened they said

49
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,540
if even if she gets all right she will

50
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,180
be damaged she won't be able to follow

51
00:02:48,540 --> 00:03:00,959
but today she's perfect all right not

52
00:02:51,180 --> 00:03:03,980
really bad but she is very hard work

53
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:08,100
from the photograph from the photograph

54
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:10,800
the photograph is a real image of myself

55
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,860
see and this fine body has got a

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,090
positions which aim it's working same

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:20,640
happens with the photograph that too has

58
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,340
the same coefficients of course it

59
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,840
hasn't got the other dimension but it

60
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,150
also emits the vibrations because of the

61
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,040
coefficients being the same say even if

62
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,840
you take prize photograph it's not real

63
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,549
because it's all come out of the

64
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,650
unconscious all right but just got a

65
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:41,160
free Majan Asian put it any photographic

66
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,500
tape of any person it is like that but

67
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,660
there are so many things I've seen which

68
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,900
are which have come out of the mother

69
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,620
earth

70
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:53,220
they emit vibrations like Stonehenge in

71
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,900
England has vibrations so many places

72
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,670
like that have aggression but not so

73
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:02,209
strong as mine because I am a living

74
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,209
person there was one fellow in

75
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:10,390
Rasha supposed to be very intelligent he

76
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:14,590
said that all right if we keep mother's

77
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:18,360
photograph and also the icons we can get

78
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:22,150
the same type of vibration you cannot

79
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:25,270
because icons are made by some artists

80
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:28,660
imaginary these are not representing

81
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:32,620
actually even Maria or Christ or anyone

82
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:37,630
they are all all imaginary if an Italian

83
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:41,020
ones makes Christ his Italian stuff he's

84
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:47,230
somebody French one makes is thin like

85
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:48,970
Frenchmen if you get us somebody say

86
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:54,580
from Holland he'll ever forehead like

87
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:55,120
that so you can see Christ if she's

88
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,470
Japanese

89
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,470
he'll have [ __ ] eyes

90
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:09,939
if he is Chinese she'll have no nose if

91
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:14,710
it's Indian he'll be down so all kinds

92
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:20,319
of crisis II and I feel that how can

93
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:23,080
they emit vibrations till while with my

94
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,539
photograph how can you come back also

95
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,379
cameras were to be developed at this

96
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:33,149
time you noticed that one cameras were

97
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:36,520
developed at this time not before that

98
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:40,899
this loudspeaker was not developed

99
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:43,689
before this so all these things are even

100
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:49,139
video even the way you are seeing my

101
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:49,139
image there was that available before No

102
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:59,169
so this is a very special time where

103
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:59,979
science has also supported seekers to

104
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,949
find it

105
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:05,889
science has so first just like a

106
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:07,270
scientist to try to accept one by

107
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:08,830
whether there's nothing has to be done I

108
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,229
mean don't have to pay me anything of

109
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,689
course that good you don't have to do

110
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:15,550
any acrobatics or anything but for

111
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:16,870
example a small thing like my photograph

112
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,059
you see many people say why your

113
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,129
photograph so use your photograph I say

114
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:22,990
if that works out you see is something

115
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:24,610
surprising that's how people you

116
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,139
challenge me why your photograph is if I

117
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,879
not use yours I will be very happy use

118
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:30,099
anybody's but doesn't work out what to

119
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:32,169
do now it's mine photograph that works

120
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:35,129
out but even if you don't like it you

121
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:38,439
have to use it what can I do

122
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:40,240
it's as simple that's bad you see but in

123
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,889
that I don't gain anything from you I

124
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,759
don't want anything from you nothing

125
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:47,860
material that you can give me but you

126
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:55,229
will enjoy you'll enjoy my laugh you

127
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:58,120
will enjoy but surge or by realization

128
00:06:55,229 --> 00:07:00,430
how is it going to work it was a very

129
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,019
big problem for me it's not that I can

130
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,659
just give you a book and you just sit

131
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:09,909
and read it and say that yes I have got

132
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:12,969
it I become it's real becoming ripening

133
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:15,060
maturing living process now how am I to

134
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:20,160
do

135
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:23,500
and here is the answer is a photograph

136
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:28,660
so this is what it is that all your

137
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:33,130
media's can be used through my

138
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:35,230
photograph what a blessing and the

139
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,350
photograph if you think is representing

140
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:40,620
me I think you're not expressing it

141
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,620
fully

142
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,560
that was a main session my photograph

143
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:51,420
are much more powerful than any sketches

144
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,420
together even to these by mother earth

145
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:03,820
because photograph has got so many

146
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:07,419
elements in it for example you see it

147
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:14,140
has got light element it has got water

148
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:19,120
element it has got earth element it has

149
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:22,230
got also air element if the air is not

150
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,230
alright little bit

151
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,759
and also it has got the eternally

152
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:39,680
with all these five elements you cannot

153
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,680
reduce the statute

154
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,620
ether element it has got because if you

155
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:58,310
have a photograph here you can

156
00:08:48,620 --> 00:09:01,670
constantly transmit it but you cannot

157
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:07,220
transmit the statue as it is only the

158
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:13,130
photograph of a statue thing so it has

159
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:18,610
also got ether in it so photograph is

160
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,610
much more powerful than any other statue

161
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:28,250
moreover it is a reproduction

162
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:35,180
no but reproduction of reality with five

163
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:38,959
enemies so I wouldn't call it just a

164
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:42,649
representative it's quite me because my

165
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,709
attention is there so the protocol of

166
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:49,940
these photographs also is important so

167
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:52,940
start developing that faith you should

168
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:59,020
keep one photograph with you all the

169
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:59,020
time in your pocket respective

170
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,670
as many as possible respective
