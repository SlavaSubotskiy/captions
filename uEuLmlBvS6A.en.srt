1
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:48,180
This falls on the day of famous great full moon,

2
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:56,347
it is called as Sharada Indu, that's the name of the Goddess also

3
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:02,806
Sharada Indu; the moon on this autumn season.

4
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:10,138
This is the biggest moon, and - of course not in England,

5
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:18,430
but in India - that day the moon is giving the greatest light,

6
00:01:19,138 --> 00:01:27,180
and it's such a great thing that Guru Nanaka was born on such a day.

7
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:35,138
As you know in India people celebrate birthdays

8
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:39,514
according to dates of the moon, called as tithi

9
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:50,514
not as the dates we have here according to the sun.

10
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,556
This great personality was born in Punjab

11
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:27,931
where people were unaware of God's ways.

12
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:45,889
He was always bothered about the Dharma in all his lives,

13
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:50,139
because as you know he was the Primal Master,

14
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:58,430
and the Primal Master is always placed

15
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,931
in looking after our Void,

16
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:08,806
in sustaining us, and giving us a model of an ideal master.

17
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:19,305
And he always took birth either in the most difficult places

18
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:23,806
like hills and dales and mountains, or they took places --

19
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:31,389
which are even more difficult thing, among the people who were horrid,

20
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:35,139
and who needed their help.

21
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:43,138
So in India, that time somehow Punjab was regarded as the place

22
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:55,931
where people did not respect God or traditional Hindu idols,

23
00:03:56,597 --> 00:04:07,848
or you can say the statues that were regarded as the vibrating ones.

24
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:14,139
But they worshipped money (even now)

25
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:19,764
and they worshipped power.

26
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:31,305
And as at that time there was a King who was very anxious

27
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:34,889
to convert people to Islamic Religion by giving them money,

28
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,722
many were taking to Islam.

29
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,514
As a result the Hindus started hating the muslims

30
00:04:46,138 --> 00:04:51,180
and a big hatred developed among Muslims and Hindus.

31
00:04:54,556 --> 00:05:00,014
That's how, in those circumstances where there was a quarrel going on

32
00:05:00,014 --> 00:05:04,681
between the followers of Mohammad and followers of Hinduism,

33
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,472
Mohammad himself took his birth on this earth,

34
00:05:09,472 --> 00:05:14,889
though he had decided not to take any more births,

35
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:17,139
he thought that it would solve the problem.

36
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:21,472
Although, this incarnation is such that it never dies.

37
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:35,597
Even if they leave the body, they are always around.

38
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:40,180
And they are the ones who perform lots of miracles

39
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:44,264
when any other incarnation comes on this earth.

40
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:49,180
They help support and guide the seekers

41
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,056
to go to the incarnations.

42
00:05:51,681 --> 00:05:54,556
So, to celebrate his birthday

43
00:05:56,681 --> 00:06:03,264
on such a date is also a myth,

44
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:07,138
because he never died. He is eternally living.

45
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:12,264
They never grow and they never die.

46
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:16,305
But his birth is important,

47
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:21,848
because symbolically he came on this earth

48
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:29,014
not to propogate any particular type of the void --

49
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:35,764
as Mohammad did or say Moses did, and before that Abraham,

50
00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:47,556
Lao Tse, or Socrates - which followed into a religion.

51
00:06:48,222 --> 00:06:54,848
But he came to create amity - we can say, to create understanding,

52
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,138
to create unity between religions.

53
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:01,722
This was a very big step for Sahaja Yoga.

54
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:07,973
After that as you know, he was born again - God knows where --

55
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,639
no one knows where he was born, but he appeared as Shirdi Sai Nath.

56
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:19,848
He too said the same thing, that to talk ill of any religion is a sin.

57
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:33,098
But these efforts are quite lost.

58
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:38,597
Because the people who were Islamic at that time,

59
00:07:39,098 --> 00:07:46,264
or those who were Hindus, are now very great fanatics.

60
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:50,722
So instead of them coming closer and loving each other

61
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:52,722
they have become fanatics.

62
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,639
Though we find that Islam is spreading so fast

63
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:09,597
Sikhism is spreading very fast too.

64
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:15,098
In America there is a horrible guru he has started to spread Sikhism.

65
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:19,138
He's converting all the white skinned people into Sikhs.

66
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:24,722
They are growing their hair, and they are also growing their beard,

67
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:29,139
and wearing a kara and all those five things

68
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,098
that were required at the time of Guru Gobind Singh.

69
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:36,014
When the war had started they had to wear all these things,

70
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,681
which was important.

71
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:45,514
Because war had started and to protect Hinduism or Hindus

72
00:08:46,138 --> 00:08:48,931
from the invasion of the Muslims --

73
00:08:49,347 --> 00:08:52,138
the fanaticism of the Muslims --

74
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:57,722
they took to this kind of a military stuff.

75
00:08:58,264 --> 00:09:02,139
Actually if you believe in God - nothing can be killed.

76
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:07,514
But I think that Guru Gobind thought that he had to take it.

77
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,848
In all these prophetic religions, if you see, all the prophets

78
00:09:11,848 --> 00:09:15,681
who have spread all the religions, they were always attacked so badly

79
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,973
that they had to take to weapons.

80
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:21,347
Even in Islam they had to take to weapons to protect themselves.

81
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:24,556
Now when these people took to weapons

82
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:28,222
they had some discipline put on the people.

83
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:33,931
Without the discipline nothing is possible.

84
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,305
And very strict discipline was there for the Sikhs.

85
00:09:38,305 --> 00:09:41,180
Now today's Sikhs are no more Sikhs,

86
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,180
they are just outside, and inside they are not.

87
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:55,889
I would not describe all the strictness and discipline

88
00:09:55,889 --> 00:10:05,347
they had to go through. But every disciple has to go

89
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:09,681
through a very severe disciplining of himself

90
00:10:10,305 --> 00:10:15,056
if he has to become the Guru. There is no doubt about it.

91
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:21,931
It is not that only somebody like Me comes and tells you

92
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:24,848
do this do that, and next day you forget these things.

93
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:29,222
It is very serious matter, one has to understand.

94
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,472
You have got your realization through Sahaja Yoga

95
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:36,389
Now you have become Sahaja Yogis.

96
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:41,098
But still I would say you are not full Sahaja Yogis

97
00:10:41,138 --> 00:10:43,806
because every Sahaja Yogi has to be a Guru

98
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,180
Otherwise he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

99
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:52,806
First of all you are Yogis because you got your realisation.

100
00:10:53,931 --> 00:10:57,430
But Yogis are of no use, you have to be Sahaja Yogis.

101
00:10:57,472 --> 00:11:00,139
So you were told about all the chakras,

102
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:08,305
every thing that you are doing, about all the problems of Kundalini

103
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:11,597
how to cure them. Everything about it was told to you.

104
00:11:11,597 --> 00:11:20,014
Now you became, with that, a different type of a race,

105
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:23,848
a different type of people, who are twice-born,

106
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:29,180
who are born by the Spirit, not by the flesh.

107
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:32,973
Remember that that's a very important point and which John has said.

108
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:37,639
That you are born by the Spirit not by the flesh.

109
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,681
Those who are born by the flesh are in flesh.

110
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:45,556
But if you are born by the Spirit, that's how you are twice born.

111
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:50,681
And when you know all about the Spirit and the Kundalini

112
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:52,514
then you are a Sahaja Yogi.

113
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:55,889
But unless and until you become Guru,

114
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:59,848
you are not a full Sahaja Yogi.

115
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:05,222
So to begin with, we must understand that the Spirit is described

116
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:08,556
as a Kala, a a phase of Moon, one phase of moon.

117
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:15,139
But a Guru is described as the full moon - purnima -Guru Purnima.

118
00:12:15,764 --> 00:12:19,514
Guru is the full moon, it's not just a phase.

119
00:12:20,098 --> 00:12:25,931
So from one phase you have to go to the stage

120
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:29,347
where you become a complete Guru.

121
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:33,056
16 phases there are altogether,

122
00:12:33,098 --> 00:12:40,180
and you have ro cross the 16 stages to become the Guru.

123
00:12:40,597 --> 00:12:42,389
Now how do we do it?

124
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:47,098
We have to become extremely objective about it.

125
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:48,931
How do we become the Guru?

126
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:50,639
Because we have to become Gurus, no doubt.

127
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,056
Now you cannot just say that, Mother you give us a tape

128
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:57,430
and we'll learn by heart and we'll go on to another person

129
00:12:57,472 --> 00:12:59,305
saying blah blah blah blah blah.

130
00:12:59,347 --> 00:13:02,180
Same thing, whetever I've told you, or take my type

131
00:13:02,222 --> 00:13:05,098
and show them that this is our Mother,

132
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:10,389
and She's like this and like that. But they will say alright

133
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:13,597
She may be, but what about you. Sir ?

134
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:20,597
Now Sahaja Yoga has a 'very' big responsibility,

135
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,639
which I don't think people understand.

136
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:27,681
I wish they could listen to me very intensely and understand it.

137
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:33,389
So far if you see. Gurus remained Gurus

138
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:35,472
and no disciples became Gurus.

139
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:40,639
They were still regarded as disciples of a Guru,

140
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:42,514
whether it was fake or anything.

141
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:46,138
They never became Gurus themselves.

142
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,764
So there was no need for them to grow,

143
00:13:50,806 --> 00:13:53,556
they had to take the name of their Guru alright.

144
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:58,556
Christ and his disciples, Mohammad Sahib had his own disciples.

145
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:04,722
Nanaka had his own disciples, Shirdi Sai Nath had his own disciples.

146
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:07,639
None of them became Gurus.

147
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:12,180
But now it is in your lot, sorry to say,

148
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,430
that you have to become the Gurus.

149
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:18,722
It's a privilege, actually.

150
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,430
It's a very great privilege to become the Guru.

151
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:28,180
And to become the Guru, we must learn what we have to do.

152
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:33,347
This also sometimes becomes just a lecture. I think so.

153
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:36,681
Because I've already told you on Guru Purnima

154
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:39,138
what are the 10 attainments we have to have.

155
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:44,764
Today all these 16 stages are to be seen,

156
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:49,931
how we have to grow into a Guru.

157
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:59,639
First is, we have complete discipline put on ourselves.

158
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:03,764
Like Mr Nick is attacked by everyone.

159
00:15:05,347 --> 00:15:09,138
No, you attack yourself. You become Mr Nick now.

160
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:17,722
You have to make this body subservient to you,

161
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:19,681
that is the first mastery.

162
00:15:20,098 --> 00:15:23,681
The mastery is that my body can sleep anywhere,

163
00:15:24,138 --> 00:15:30,264
it can starve itself, it can live under any circumstances,

164
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,722
it dare not grudge.

165
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:37,639
Anywhere; it should be able to sleep any time,

166
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:39,848
it should be able to keep awake anytime.

167
00:15:40,681 --> 00:15:42,764
This body is to be mastered.

168
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:46,347
Even if you read 'Ashtanga Yoga'

169
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:48,931
first thing is mastery over the body, they say.

170
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:52,138
So after realisation the first thing you have to do

171
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:53,597
is master this body,

172
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,681
and is the most difficult thing for western people;

173
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,472
because the matter is sitting on their Spirit.

174
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:05,889
First the Spirit has to come - first phase --

175
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:08,639
at least the Spirit has to be there.

176
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:16,098
If you have to be the Spirit then thematter of moon

177
00:16:16,098 --> 00:16:18,514
has to be covered with that light.

178
00:16:19,347 --> 00:16:22,430
In the first phase we have to master our body.

179
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:26,305
So what do we do to master our body ?

180
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:30,973
First of all we must see that what are the things

181
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:36,556
that drain out our bodily mastery.

182
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:41,889
We must know all the crooks who try to master us.

183
00:16:42,305 --> 00:17:06,764
So I have to first face my body.

184
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:14,681
That first and foremost thing in Sahaja Yoga we learn

185
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,806
that we have to respect our body.

186
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:22,973
This is the first principle of respecting our body.

187
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:26,389
Means indulgence is sinful to the body,

188
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:32,681
because indulgence gives you a body which is no good:

189
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:37,681
First of all you must respect your body

190
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:39,931
so that you can master it.

191
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:42,264
If I do not respect you, I cannot master you.

192
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:46,430
So to master the body first of all respect your body.

193
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:52,430
And to respect your body, you must look after your body very well.

194
00:17:54,014 --> 00:17:55,639
But no indulgence.

195
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:59,430
That doesn't mean that you go and stand in the mud

196
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:03,889
or rain for hours together or get exposed,

197
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:12,222
to make your body absolutely sort of a abode for all the diseases

198
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:14,389
and colds and coughs and things like that

199
00:18:14,806 --> 00:18:19,472
so your Mother suffers cleaning your vishuddhi!

200
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:26,222
It's like a horse whose neck is down.

201
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:33,264
So you must look after your body by hot giving it diseases.

202
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:36,514
Laziness is against it.

203
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:38,848
Persons who are lazy must know

204
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:41,556
that laziness is against your body.

205
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:45,264
Lazy people who are not bothered to dress up properly,

206
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:49,764
to cover themselves up properly, look after their body properly,

207
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:57,430
put oil into different screws that they have, to massage themselves.

208
00:18:58,014 --> 00:19:00,597
Look after the body, that's the point.

209
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:04,848
To look after the body you must give some time,

210
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:07,430
because this body is the temple of God.

211
00:19:07,472 --> 00:19:09,889
And now you have become the temple

212
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:11,556
but if the temple is dirty,

213
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:20,056
is sick, is unimpressive, is like a stick, or like a balloon,

214
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:23,389
nobody is going to come near it.

215
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:28,305
So try to improve your personality,

216
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:32,764
that it has to be a beautiful temple.

217
00:19:35,264 --> 00:19:39,722
I mean, I have given you so many tips, that I think

218
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:43,556
that in my lives' time I have not given so many tips, even as Guru.

219
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:47,722
Because normally people who came to a Guru in those days

220
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:50,305
were really, really great seekers.

221
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,639
They would hang themselves upside down, just to please the Guru,

222
00:19:54,222 --> 00:19:56,014
for months together.

223
00:19:59,347 --> 00:20:03,305
So that was a very different quality people -- but one or two.

224
00:20:04,056 --> 00:20:07,472
And when you have quantity quality goes down, I accept.

225
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:11,138
But why not you people take it upon yourselves

226
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:13,639
that we'll make our quality first class ?

227
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:15,889
So first of all train up your body well.

228
00:20:18,472 --> 00:20:21,472
You must take some exercises in the morning, I have told you.

229
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,098
That people sleep after breakfast I am told,

230
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:29,430
I was amazed. I mean, this is too much.

231
00:20:29,931 --> 00:20:34,806
You see, God has given you this house as a blessing,

232
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:43,264
to be more alert, to give His light to others.

233
00:20:43,305 --> 00:20:51,222
Instead of that if the candle is not even flickering what's the use.

234
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:59,222
So what you have to do is to first of all brush up, yourself, completely.

235
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:02,639
Make your body alright, alert.

236
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:06,222
Actually at your age one should not sleep

237
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:10,098
for more than six or seven hours, I tell you. No need.

238
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:14,222
Six or seven hours of deep sleep is sufficient.

239
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:19,889
I also, in the night I sleep about --

240
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:22,430
never before eleven sometimes at twelve,

241
00:21:22,472 --> 00:21:26,389
Yesterday we slept at 20'clock, got up at 5. 30 as usual.

242
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,472
So how many ? Three and a half hours sleep.

243
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:33,264
And just now I slept for about at the most for half an hour

244
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:34,973
or an hour or so finished.

245
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:40,389
When you don't have to work, like me,

246
00:21:41,014 --> 00:21:43,264
in the sense that even when I sleep I am working.

247
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:49,180
So to rest your body for such a long time

248
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,305
you make your body sit on your head

249
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:56,139
and it will be very very difficult for you to be alert.

250
00:21:57,889 --> 00:22:01,139
So first of all body must be looked after.

251
00:22:01,764 --> 00:22:03,848
There should be no self-indulgence.

252
00:22:04,305 --> 00:22:07,139
I mean it can go to any extent of self indulgence.

253
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,305
Like people don't keep their rooms clean, their clothes clean,

254
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:14,514
they have no activities - all these nonsensical things,

255
00:22:14,556 --> 00:22:17,806
only it is too low, too base to talk about; but it happens.

256
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:21,139
People can go to any base limit - you know,

257
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,889
that's the problem, what to do?

258
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:29,098
On this full moon day one has to realize

259
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:32,639
that on a full moon day you are over-active.

260
00:22:32,848 --> 00:22:35,556
As the moon starts growing the activity starts.

261
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:37,138
In the night also.

262
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:41,430
But none of you so far

263
00:22:41,472 --> 00:22:43,305
are active in the night except for me.

264
00:22:44,138 --> 00:22:47,138
But if you come up you will be surprised,

265
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:49,514
even in your sleep you will be active.

266
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:57,764
So first and foremost thing is that you must look after your body.

267
00:22:57,764 --> 00:22:59,472
The body should be presentable.

268
00:23:00,764 --> 00:23:07,931
And should not go with the so-called fashions of the day.

269
00:23:07,973 --> 00:23:09,472
It is very important.

270
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:12,889
One should not go with the fashions of the day,

271
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:17,222
and take to something which is nonsensical,

272
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:21,848
which is not good for your appearance,

273
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:26,138
which makes you look funny or very fashionable

274
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:27,931
like a dandy person.

275
00:23:28,347 --> 00:23:33,722
We have to wear a dress which is in the centre, dignified, which is good.

276
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:44,806
Now I'm told that it is very difficult even to wake up in England.

277
00:23:45,472 --> 00:23:47,889
Somebody had told me, when I was young,

278
00:23:48,264 --> 00:23:50,597
that don't wake up an Englishman.

279
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,430
I haven't tried that, even with a barge pole.

280
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,681
I just tell you at this time, never in the morning time.

281
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:03,931
Because I've been warned: never wake up an Englishman,

282
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:06,222
that is the greatest sin on this earth!

283
00:24:12,764 --> 00:24:16,472
So why should the English be so much addicted to sleep!

284
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:20,014
The whole country is sleeping today.

285
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:24,430
They want more wages, more wages so that they can sleep more.

286
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:30,180
Eat and drink, drink and eat in between, sleep.

287
00:24:30,222 --> 00:24:35,597
This is the three - programmed life.

288
00:24:38,472 --> 00:24:42,222
It was very difficult, from the very beginnig

289
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:47,430
I saw Sahaja Yogis coming, in that to wake them up was difficult.

290
00:24:47,472 --> 00:24:53,222
And these are the same people who were known for punctuality

291
00:24:53,264 --> 00:24:57,931
that they won the war at Waterloo because of punctuality,

292
00:24:58,681 --> 00:25:04,098
and they were so punctual that people used to set their watches --

293
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:06,931
even in America. They are the same people.

294
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:11,931
Now the other side of it is that they sleep like log of wood.

295
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:15,098
They used to sleep before also must be, because this is an old saying that.

296
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,889
Don't wake up an Englishman.

297
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:21,931
But I used to think something else about it why it is said,

298
00:25:21,931 --> 00:25:24,681
but it is nothing but simple laziness.

299
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:33,056
So try to see why we sleep so much.

300
00:25:36,973 --> 00:25:41,098
If the left side is strong, people sleep.

301
00:25:42,014 --> 00:25:46,305
If the back Agnya is strong, people sleep.

302
00:25:46,472 --> 00:25:52,806
If the front Agnya is working too much

303
00:25:53,347 --> 00:25:55,722
then people don't sleep.

304
00:25:58,347 --> 00:26:01,347
So even if I say, "Don't sleep",

305
00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:06,973
it mean that you put your right Agnya in working condition,

306
00:26:06,973 --> 00:26:08,973
that means you start thinking.

307
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:10,764
Which is against Sahaja Yoga again.

308
00:26:12,014 --> 00:26:14,973
So it would be left agnya, right agnya, right agnya, left agnya,

309
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,264
left agnya, left agnya, right agnya, left agnya...

310
00:26:16,264 --> 00:26:18,514
It will be going from one to another.

311
00:26:20,597 --> 00:26:29,472
So in the centre you have to be with Christ.

312
00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:38,138
He is alert every second of the day;

313
00:26:43,931 --> 00:26:47,222
killing; beating, hitting,

314
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:54,806
curing, looking after, guiding.

315
00:26:55,597 --> 00:27:04,681
Twenty four hours a day. And go and ask any realized soul

316
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:07,389
who is called as Avadhuta, the one who is a master,

317
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:11,722
they will tell you they hardly sleep for three hours or four hours.

318
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:15,889
Because they cannot work when they are sleeping,

319
00:27:16,138 --> 00:27:17,639
so they sleep for four hours,

320
00:27:17,681 --> 00:27:19,556
the rest of the time they are working:

321
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:24,556
either they meditate and do things by projection,

322
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:28,389
or they work with their hands.

323
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:31,722
They are busy people, they are very busy.

324
00:27:32,222 --> 00:27:39,639
You have to be very busy people because now you are employed by God.

325
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:45,514
And you have to do full justice to this employment by working hard.

326
00:27:46,138 --> 00:27:52,389
On the contrary you have seen that it is very easy to get lazy.

327
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:02,973
So now, as many of you are already feeling sleepy, put your....

328
00:28:03,806 --> 00:28:07,138
First thing should be for all those people who are lazy,

329
00:28:07,138 --> 00:28:09,931
is to put their right to the left seven times -

330
00:28:10,014 --> 00:28:11,305
let's have it.

331
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:16,514
With the right hand....

332
00:28:31,931 --> 00:28:37,138
It's better? Now the back Agnya.

333
00:28:37,138 --> 00:28:39,014
Let's have it.

334
00:28:41,931 --> 00:28:48,889
Laziness is first. Shri Krishna was against laziness.

335
00:28:48,889 --> 00:28:53,973
Anywhere he got a chance he talked against laziness, Alasya.

336
00:28:55,931 --> 00:28:57,848
Now watch me.

337
00:28:58,764 --> 00:29:00,889
On the photograph you can do the same....

338
00:29:58,889 --> 00:30:00,556
Better now?

339
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:08,138
Tonight we have to keep awake; it's a big problem.

340
00:30:09,848 --> 00:30:12,764
But don't sleep formally here. Alright ?

341
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:14,806
Informally you can.

342
00:30:28,889 --> 00:30:30,806
Better ?

343
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:36,597
Put your eyes, try Again.

344
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:12,973
So the mastery should be, first of all, of your body.

345
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,681
Say, you are sleeping on one side, you get a pain --

346
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:19,889
then what do you do? You sleep on the other side.

347
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:25,764
In the same way, this body is to be made

348
00:31:25,764 --> 00:31:29,472
immune to different shocks,

349
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:32,806
you see. Like you put the watch in the water.

350
00:31:33,264 --> 00:31:36,597
You shock it with the water, so it is waterproof.

351
00:31:37,056 --> 00:31:40,305
So a Sahaja Yogi has to be an all-proofed person.

352
00:31:41,973 --> 00:31:50,889
So he has no place to complain,

353
00:31:51,597 --> 00:31:54,014
because he's supposed to be all-proof, you see.

354
00:31:54,056 --> 00:31:57,098
Anybody (Sahaja Yogi) who complains, you can say,

355
00:31:57,138 --> 00:31:58,931
"How are you complaining?

356
00:31:58,931 --> 00:32:00,514
Because you have to be all-proof."

357
00:32:02,305 --> 00:32:12,098
So no complaints of any kind, of Sahaja Yogis

358
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,514
are to be accepted or sympathized.

359
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:25,430
If you start accepting people who are complaining type

360
00:32:26,014 --> 00:32:28,347
you will be always busy looking after them,

361
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:32,389
and you will be of no use to Sahaja Yoga.

362
00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:37,931
Those who have habits of complaininig and all that

363
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:40,056
should go to the hospital and stay there.

364
00:32:40,681 --> 00:32:44,347
Complaining people are really people

365
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:47,222
who have some sort of possession,

366
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:51,305
I think, that they all the time complain and try to torture you,

367
00:32:51,848 --> 00:32:54,138
and make a nuisance out of themselves.

368
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,138
Such people cannot become Gurus.

369
00:32:57,138 --> 00:33:01,973
Imagine - if the Guru is complaining then what is he going to teach?

370
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:03,806
Only complaining.

371
00:33:04,556 --> 00:33:07,639
The teachers will be expert in complaining

372
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:09,889
and the students will be also experts in complaining.

373
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:15,056
So you create a set of complaining disciples, you see,

374
00:33:16,347 --> 00:33:18,472
And when they come to Me what I find

375
00:33:18,514 --> 00:33:22,264
they all have double lists than yourselves about their complaints.

376
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:26,556
But also it is very characteristic.

377
00:33:26,597 --> 00:33:28,806
Like Australians seldom complain,

378
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,098
and if they do complain they are hit also very badly.

379
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:35,722
Seldom you will find an Australian complaining.

380
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,889
I have got letters - except one or two

381
00:33:38,305 --> 00:33:41,222
who have now found themselves out - seldom

382
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:46,222
they complain about themselves, about their body comforts,

383
00:33:46,222 --> 00:33:49,389
this thing that thing. So under any circumstances

384
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:54,722
those who can live are the people

385
00:33:55,139 --> 00:33:57,681
who have achieved the one sixteenth,

386
00:33:58,138 --> 00:33:59,722
only the one sixteenth.

387
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:02,681
(Jaise rakhahu taise hi rahu)

388
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:06,389
Mother the way you keep it we are willing to stay.

389
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:09,931
Of course the Mother has kept you very well.

390
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:16,180
All the luxuries of world Mother has given you.

391
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,514
She doesn't torture you like other Gurus have tortured.

392
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:22,764
Once and for all.

393
00:34:23,138 --> 00:34:25,973
My Son has gone through all the tortures,

394
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:32,139
there is no need to put you to any tortures or troubles.

395
00:34:32,347 --> 00:34:34,597
But you should see how your body reacts,

396
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,639
and tell your body, "Yes Mr body, will you please now,

397
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:42,764
behave yourself and not try to be indulgent."

398
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:51,056
All these indulgences come to us through our senses.

399
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,848
So if you can master your body

400
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,347
you will also master your senses.

401
00:34:57,889 --> 00:35:08,597
For example the master, or we say the highest of the organs

402
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,180
which controls most of the organs, I personally think, is the tongue.

403
00:35:12,848 --> 00:35:17,347
Because it's the primordial nonsense.

404
00:35:20,597 --> 00:35:26,973
By tongue we speak things to hurt others.

405
00:35:27,597 --> 00:35:32,347
With tongue we learn how to go on jabbering.

406
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:36,806
With tongue we can show how frivolous we are.

407
00:35:37,514 --> 00:35:40,722
Either we are tongue tied or tongue - loose,

408
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,639
there's nothing in between with the tongue.

409
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:46,056
That's only about talking part, that's lower.

410
00:35:46,472 --> 00:35:50,098
But when it comes higher, eating;

411
00:35:52,098 --> 00:35:54,138
all the time thinking about eating.

412
00:35:54,138 --> 00:35:57,722
I have told you a hundred times, that Sahaja Yogis should go

413
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:03,222
on really sometimes on absolutely bland boiled horrible food --

414
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:11,639
just to test the tongue. Do it, try this, then try this.

415
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:15,806
My father used to tell that you must burn your tongue a little bit.

416
00:36:16,305 --> 00:36:18,848
That's one of the tests he said one should do.

417
00:36:18,848 --> 00:36:21,056
But he was a hard taskmaster as a Guru.

418
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,722
So we should see what our tongue can bear,

419
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:28,138
is it fussy about food ?

420
00:36:33,056 --> 00:36:38,222
When it sees the food does it start watering, first of all;

421
00:36:42,514 --> 00:36:45,430
does it take our attention to food,

422
00:36:46,014 --> 00:36:47,931
is food important to us?

423
00:36:48,430 --> 00:37:00,973
So the first thing, to overcome the problem of your tongue is

424
00:37:00,973 --> 00:37:05,722
"to starve." Starvation is the only way

425
00:37:05,764 --> 00:37:09,264
you can correct yourself. You see if you starve yourself --

426
00:37:09,347 --> 00:37:15,848
say, morning just have little to eat, reduce it to half.

427
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:18,722
You'll be surprised your intestine will be halved also.

428
00:37:18,722 --> 00:37:21,639
After some time you cannot eat more even if you want to.

429
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:26,639
Your interest will go off. Train up yourself.

430
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:28,681
Starvation is a very good thing.

431
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:32,180
I think 40 days that Christ did is a very good idea.

432
00:37:34,722 --> 00:37:39,722
But that should not be a kind of a thing that like - they have Ramazan,

433
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:45,806
that they eat the most s..... food during that time early in the morning

434
00:37:45,806 --> 00:37:48,222
then the whole day they starve - thinking about food!

435
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:57,514
Starve yourself fully and don't think about food.

436
00:37:57,514 --> 00:37:59,764
That's difficult so starve yourself  in halfway

437
00:38:00,138 --> 00:38:01,639
and dont think about food.

438
00:38:03,098 --> 00:38:05,848
Gradually try to master your tongue.

439
00:38:06,597 --> 00:38:10,180
Mastery of your tongue is only possible if you know

440
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:13,389
how to starve your day. This is for the western side.

441
00:38:13,472 --> 00:38:17,430
For eastern side they fast morning till evening.

442
00:38:18,681 --> 00:38:21,056
I know one lady, if you ask them they say

443
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:25,139
"I observe Monday, I observe Tuesday, I observe Wednesday,

444
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,764
I observe Thursday, I observe Friday a fast,

445
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:35,014
and perhaps maybe if I do not starve Saturday I will eat on Sunday."

446
00:38:35,848 --> 00:38:39,139
I have know such people in my life time - many --

447
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:41,848
who just go on fasting.

448
00:38:41,848 --> 00:38:43,973
They are such experts and astute? you see,

449
00:38:44,597 --> 00:38:48,514
that they can show you that they can fast for 50 days, 80 days,

450
00:38:48,514 --> 00:38:52,556
108 days, and 300 days.

451
00:38:53,056 --> 00:38:55,139
Starving masters.

452
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:59,389
So for them I have to tell, "you have to eat'', when they are starve.

453
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,014
To you I have to say,

454
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:04,681
"Let us see which day we can starve ourselves."

455
00:39:04,681 --> 00:39:11,138
Let us have one day to celebrate today's great day of Nanaka!

456
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:14,806
One day let us starve. Which day should we?

457
00:39:17,056 --> 00:39:21,889
Monday we cannot because Monday we have a programme,

458
00:39:23,472 --> 00:39:29,056
Tuesday we cannot because it is a day when Hanuman has to work,

459
00:39:32,722 --> 00:39:35,764
Wednesday we cannot, because then the creativity takes place,

460
00:39:37,347 --> 00:39:40,639
Thursday we cannot because we are Guru at that day,

461
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:43,889
we have to work very hard as Gurus, Friday we cannot,

462
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:46,056
we have to work the shakti of Mother,

463
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:48,556
Saturday we cannot because we have to do

464
00:39:48,556 --> 00:39:52,430
all the intrigue of Shri Krishna.

465
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:56,347
And Sunday how can it be, this is the day of the sun!"

466
00:39:59,056 --> 00:40:03,138
So which is the best day for starving, now let us see.

467
00:40:04,305 --> 00:40:10,597
We should have Thursday, because Thursday is the Guru's day

468
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:15,597
and let us do some fasting, half day, half day can we?

469
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:18,848
Can we start with half day then f... day?

470
00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:21,848
Thursday let us have, maybe second half

471
00:40:21,848 --> 00:40:24,222
because breakfast is essential I think.

472
00:40:25,305 --> 00:40:28,556
Without breakfast you see, the horses cannot whinny,

473
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:33,305
so let us have the second half

474
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:39,056
or we can have the first half.

475
00:40:39,806 --> 00:40:45,430
Actually you have to discipline yourself, if you have to be the Gurus.

476
00:40:45,472 --> 00:40:48,222
It's like going to a college,

477
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,264
when you are left to yourself,

478
00:40:50,305 --> 00:40:53,180
it is you, who has to discipline yourself,

479
00:40:53,222 --> 00:40:56,138
nobody has to tell you that you do this and do that

480
00:40:56,138 --> 00:40:58,347
That's the measure to wake you up.

481
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:01,430
In India it is the other way around.

482
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,764
If you tell somebody that you have to wake up at 5,

483
00:41:05,556 --> 00:41:10,806
the person who has told you will be awakened at 4 o' clock himself,

484
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:15,139
the one who has told; so that he doesn't get up to wake him up.

485
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:17,639
Did you follow me?

486
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,889
And the whole house will be awakened at 4 o'clock

487
00:41:21,305 --> 00:41:24,264
so that they can take up the duty from the person

488
00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:25,764
who has to get awakened.

489
00:41:28,098 --> 00:41:29,889
But the fellow who has to awaken

490
00:41:29,931 --> 00:41:31,597
might not sleep the whole night.

491
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:36,014
It is just the other way round, the other extreme of it.

492
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:42,764
Say if I am there, one night I sleep there. If I get up

493
00:41:43,305 --> 00:41:46,514
at one o'clock I find all of them sitting and meditating,

494
00:41:46,514 --> 00:41:49,138
in the passage, up to the bathroom everywhere.

495
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,180
They have not gone home, not taken food, nothing.

496
00:41:52,681 --> 00:41:55,222
Just meditating, taking vibrations, correcting.

497
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:56,889
I am sleeping inside.

498
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,138
In the night I want to go to the bathroom,

499
00:41:59,138 --> 00:42:01,264
I just cannot go because they are all meditating.

500
00:42:01,305 --> 00:42:03,472
Nobody is sleeping, nobody is sleeping.

501
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:12,180
So it is the other way around.

502
00:42:13,138 --> 00:42:15,806
So to you people let us do one day.

503
00:42:15,806 --> 00:42:21,138
That you must have one day fasting, one day keeping, one awake.

504
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:24,222
Which day should it be? Let's see.

505
00:42:27,222 --> 00:42:29,806
A day when there is no film!

506
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:44,848
Half night, second half I mean, not the first half.

507
00:42:48,722 --> 00:43:00,139
Which day? Which is the most difficult day when you cannot,

508
00:43:02,138 --> 00:43:09,973
cannot keep awake. Sunday night;

509
00:43:10,973 --> 00:43:13,597
but there's a fiIm on!

510
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:19,639
Without the film, you see!

511
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:22,722
Treat yourself like that, joke with yourself,

512
00:43:22,722 --> 00:43:25,556
now Sunday night is there a film on?

513
00:43:25,597 --> 00:43:27,222
After 12 there isn't.

514
00:43:27,264 --> 00:43:29,597
So Sunday night you get up at 12 o'clock.

515
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:36,931
Let's have it. Enjoy it. Don't get angry.

516
00:43:38,973 --> 00:43:41,098
Make a fun out of it.

517
00:43:43,973 --> 00:43:48,138
You think more about it, then you get upset.

518
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:50,180
You just don't think about it, then you'll enjoy it.

519
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,722
It's like swimming.

520
00:43:51,764 --> 00:43:56,264
Get up at 12 o'clock, all of you, go for a bath, sit down,

521
00:43:56,305 --> 00:43:59,973
sing Bhajans, this, that, let us do it. Should we ?

522
00:44:04,722 --> 00:44:07,681
Michel, What happen with you?

523
00:44:07,722 --> 00:44:14,180
"I can go to bed at two o clock"

524
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:18,098
You have to get up at 12 o'clock,

525
00:44:18,098 --> 00:44:22,139
you have to go to bed till 12 o'clock.

526
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,139
Get up at 12 o'clock.

527
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:28,138
You see the first half of the night, one must sleep always, it's better.

528
00:44:28,347 --> 00:44:32,639
Second half of the night is the better part, alright?

529
00:44:32,848 --> 00:44:36,014
So the first half of the night you all have to sleep, anytime.

530
00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:39,139
You can sleep about 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock if you want to.

531
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:44,889
But that should not be important, what time you sleep,

532
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:48,014
you have to get up at 12 o'clock in the morning,

533
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:50,848
or say after 12.

534
00:44:54,722 --> 00:44:57,806
Shri Krishna was born in the night about 12 o'clock.

535
00:44:57,806 --> 00:45:00,014
Nanaka was born 12 o'clock in the night.

536
00:45:00,014 --> 00:45:04,222
All the Gurus mostly took their birth at 12 o'clock in the night.

537
00:45:05,056 --> 00:45:10,681
To celebrate that, we must have one day when we do not sleep after 12.

538
00:45:11,347 --> 00:45:15,138
But then what about Caxton Hall!

539
00:45:15,597 --> 00:45:18,681
"Mother we can try this on Saturday.

540
00:45:18,764 --> 00:45:20,264
¿What?

541
00:45:20,764 --> 00:45:23,389
¿Can we do it in Saturday night? It will be more safe

542
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:26,389
because will be less incidents the Sunday that Monday"

543
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:34,056
Alright so you can sleep in the day time of Saturday or of Sunday.

544
00:45:34,514 --> 00:45:36,264
Sunday afternoon you can sleep.

545
00:45:36,347 --> 00:45:38,597
No, no, no that won't be alright.

546
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:44,014
If you make any compensation

547
00:45:44,056 --> 00:45:46,722
then you are not torturing your body much!

548
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:51,222
You must devise a method by which

549
00:45:51,264 --> 00:45:54,347
your body does see that it has to get up at 12 o'clock,

550
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:55,764
Better keep it that time.

551
00:45:55,806 --> 00:45:58,138
What do you think ? Alright.

552
00:45:58,138 --> 00:46:02,347
"¿Do you think that this may affect the job on Monday?"

553
00:46:02,389 --> 00:46:04,430
¿What he said?

554
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:06,639
"That the job of the people may be affected

555
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,222
on Monday morning, Mother".

556
00:46:08,264 --> 00:46:13,681
They will never, take it from me, they will not:

557
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:16,138
You see work is not important what is important

558
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:21,639
is your Spirit, your mastery.

559
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:25,180
Work, in any case you're not going to have after some time,

560
00:46:25,931 --> 00:46:28,180
so that work is not important.

561
00:46:28,222 --> 00:46:31,472
This new work that you have taken, better look after that.

562
00:46:31,472 --> 00:46:35,472
Forget about your work. Forget about these things.

563
00:46:35,514 --> 00:46:38,098
What is important is your Spirit.

564
00:46:38,138 --> 00:46:40,347
Otherwise you cannot become Gurus.

565
00:46:41,138 --> 00:46:43,138
Spirit is the most important thing.

566
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:46,806
The rest of the things are absolutely unimportant,

567
00:46:46,806 --> 00:46:48,722
a zero.

568
00:46:51,556 --> 00:46:56,347
I've been very slowly trying to take you out

569
00:46:56,389 --> 00:47:00,806
of the mud of materialism and of these mundane things.

570
00:47:01,305 --> 00:47:06,430
But you have to work for God. You are special people.

571
00:47:07,973 --> 00:47:12,389
So, you have to make yourself a master,

572
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:19,430
so God gives you all the blessings, everything.

573
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,848
But the idea of luxurious life must be given up.

574
00:47:24,556 --> 00:47:28,056
People want to make this life luxurious,

575
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:31,347
then you'll have the luxury of this world

576
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:34,472
but not the luxury of God's blessings.

577
00:47:35,014 --> 00:47:37,098
One of the two you have to select.

578
00:47:37,556 --> 00:47:50,848
Either you lead a life which is luxurious on the material level,

579
00:47:50,973 --> 00:47:54,848
or you lead a luxurious life of God's blessings.

580
00:47:54,848 --> 00:47:57,722
One of the two you have to choose, the time has come.

581
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,681
So nothing is important you see,

582
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:05,056
the insecurity of money also is another nonsense.

583
00:48:05,056 --> 00:48:07,264
At least you people should not have it.

584
00:48:08,056 --> 00:48:10,681
I mean you will never starve at least,

585
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:14,056
but Indians if they do not work they will starve.

586
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:19,556
But you people can never starve, if you are unemployed,

587
00:48:19,556 --> 00:48:25,014
government is happy more, as long as you don't bother them.

588
00:48:25,889 --> 00:48:28,597
If you sit at home and meditate

589
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,056
they'll be very happy.

590
00:48:31,098 --> 00:48:36,556
So to earn more money or to make more money

591
00:48:36,597 --> 00:48:38,764
is not important at all in Sahaja Yoga.

592
00:48:40,597 --> 00:48:43,681
Most important thing is to be the Spirit.

593
00:48:43,722 --> 00:48:45,931
For that whatever is to be done has to be done.

594
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:52,430
Let everything suffer, you don't make your Spirit suffer.

595
00:48:55,014 --> 00:49:03,556
Because you have to become the full moon, like Guru Nanak.

596
00:49:04,222 --> 00:49:07,430
How much did Guru Nanak earn?

597
00:49:12,681 --> 00:49:19,973
You should find out, how did he live his life ?

598
00:49:25,764 --> 00:49:30,973
There is nothing to bother about money,

599
00:49:31,931 --> 00:49:35,014
because more money is not needed.

600
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:42,138
Just needed for your food and your living.

601
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:46,597
And then money is arranged if you need

602
00:49:46,597 --> 00:49:48,639
any extra money sometimes, emergencies.

603
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:51,222
I've done it for many Australians, you know.

604
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:55,681
But those are the people who have dedicated themselves fully.

605
00:49:57,848 --> 00:50:00,222
And that is why they have been helped,

606
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:02,722
whenever there is an emergency they don't have to bother.

607
00:50:03,305 --> 00:50:08,180
But the dedication to your Spirit has to be full, complete,

608
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:12,305
and nothing to your work, actually.

609
00:50:13,056 --> 00:50:15,722
Because that goes hand in hand.

610
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:20,973
If you are not worried about yourself after realisation,

611
00:50:22,138 --> 00:50:26,222
about your Spirit, you'll have all the problems of the world.

612
00:50:26,806 --> 00:50:29,056
First and foremost is financial problems.

613
00:50:35,138 --> 00:50:44,138
Then, physical problem, mental problem, emotional problem.

614
00:50:44,806 --> 00:50:46,806
All kinds of problems will follow,

615
00:50:46,848 --> 00:50:50,848
because I've awakened your Kundalini; one part I've done.

616
00:50:51,806 --> 00:50:54,472
But another part that is your heart, you have not opened.

617
00:50:54,514 --> 00:50:56,806
You must give your heart to Sahaja Yoga.

618
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:59,430
You have not opened your heart as yet.

619
00:51:00,139 --> 00:51:03,056
Heart has to be opened.

620
00:51:03,556 --> 00:51:06,014
You are still woried about your father, mother,

621
00:51:06,056 --> 00:51:07,889
brother, sister, wife, children.

622
00:51:08,597 --> 00:51:14,973
Open your heart fully to Sahaja Yoga.

623
00:51:15,556 --> 00:51:17,597
In a doubtless way.

624
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:20,597
Then only doubt less awareness will settle down.

625
00:51:21,222 --> 00:51:23,973
Unless and until you open your heart,

626
00:51:24,139 --> 00:51:26,264
Kundalini rising has no meaning.

627
00:51:26,848 --> 00:51:31,347
Because the Kundalini is rising but the heart has not opened.

628
00:51:31,973 --> 00:51:36,056
If the Mother Earth sends forth her power through the seed

629
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:39,138
and the seed doesn't open, then what's the use ?

630
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:40,889
It's all a myth.

631
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,138
Open your heart to Sahaja Yoga.

632
00:51:43,347 --> 00:51:46,056
Open your heart to Spirit, and say,

633
00:51:46,056 --> 00:51:48,014
"Mother we are the Spirit."

634
00:51:50,056 --> 00:51:51,639
You have to realize this,

635
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:53,722
many people also perhaps do no realize

636
00:51:53,722 --> 00:51:57,514
that you have come on this earth to be the Spirit

637
00:51:57,973 --> 00:52:00,806
and not to be workers of human beings.

638
00:52:02,556 --> 00:52:08,347
You must understand your greatness and know

639
00:52:08,389 --> 00:52:12,389
that you are not like mundan people. That's why you are blessed.

640
00:52:13,014 --> 00:52:14,681
Who is blessed so much ?

641
00:52:15,264 --> 00:52:18,056
You are described long time back by Blake,

642
00:52:18,556 --> 00:52:21,347
that such and such people are going to come on this earth

643
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,764
"men of God." Men of God.

644
00:52:25,305 --> 00:52:28,681
What do you have in your heart?

645
00:52:30,556 --> 00:52:33,931
Your heart will be like a stone.

646
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:37,389
Unless and until there is light of the Spirit

647
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:39,806
it is a stone heart,

648
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:47,764
and this stone is going to hurt everyone, is going to ruin you completely.

649
00:52:48,222 --> 00:52:52,305
Open your heart hundred percent.

650
00:52:57,514 --> 00:52:59,973
You have met Indian Sahaja Yogis,

651
00:53:01,098 --> 00:53:02,681
they have problems of money.

652
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:06,639
And how much they work for Sahaja Yoga,

653
00:53:07,098 --> 00:53:12,764
day in and day out how much they have contributed for Sahaja Yoga.

654
00:53:13,305 --> 00:53:18,138
You can imagine, about 7 lakhs of rupees they have collected,

655
00:53:18,138 --> 00:53:25,597
Rustom knows. 7 lakhs of rupees, they have collected for their ashram.

656
00:53:26,139 --> 00:53:35,264
7 lakhs is about £35000.£ 35000 they have collected only in Bombay.

657
00:53:35,556 --> 00:53:39,931
In Delhi they have collected about 5 lakhs, £ 25000.

658
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:45,681
They are working, they have families they have children,

659
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:49,806
but what they think about is nothing but Sahaja Yoga,

660
00:53:49,806 --> 00:53:51,848
nothing but Sahaja Yoga, nothing but Sahaja Yoga.

661
00:53:58,098 --> 00:54:01,722
They give most of their money for Sahaja Yoga, I think.

662
00:54:02,556 --> 00:54:04,305
They live with minimum.

663
00:54:04,848 --> 00:54:09,056
If I tell them why don't you buy another shirt for yourself,

664
00:54:09,722 --> 00:54:15,514
they will say, "Mother, I have worn lots of shirts in my previous life,"

665
00:54:18,138 --> 00:54:21,889
So satisfied ! "We have found the Atma now,

666
00:54:21,931 --> 00:54:24,264
let us dress up the Atma.

667
00:54:24,305 --> 00:54:28,430
We have found out our heart, let us become the heart".

668
00:54:28,472 --> 00:54:30,889
What is the need to worry about these things ?

669
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:33,180
We have done enough of all this nonsense.

670
00:54:33,973 --> 00:54:38,430
I tell you they will think they are poor, but they are not.

671
00:54:39,848 --> 00:54:42,722
Wherever they can save their money they will save it.

672
00:54:43,222 --> 00:54:45,722
They used to give me some money before, I said,

673
00:54:45,764 --> 00:54:47,889
"No I don't need just now, there's no need"

674
00:54:47,889 --> 00:54:49,806
They said I have no place to keep;

675
00:54:49,848 --> 00:54:51,973
there is no trust, nothing, how are we to do it?

676
00:54:52,514 --> 00:55:02,472
They continued like this till about, I think, in, 74,

677
00:55:06,764 --> 00:55:10,222
when I went back we thought of starting an ashram,

678
00:55:10,264 --> 00:55:12,806
because you people were all coming there.

679
00:55:14,848 --> 00:55:20,556
So I said alright, now you have to give me money,

680
00:55:20,597 --> 00:55:23,722
all the Sahaja Yogis can give me money, whatever they have saved.

681
00:55:24,222 --> 00:55:27,264
And you'll be amazed everyone came out with 1000 rupees,

682
00:55:27,305 --> 00:55:32,472
every one of them, whether he was a labourer or every one of them,

683
00:55:32,514 --> 00:55:37,014
1000 rupees minimum. Up to 21 000.

684
00:55:37,764 --> 00:55:40,973
In 3 years time they had saved,

685
00:55:41,014 --> 00:55:42,889
because they thought it is our responsibility

686
00:55:42,931 --> 00:55:44,514
to save money for Sahaja Yoga.

687
00:55:44,556 --> 00:55:46,931
Tomorrow if we have to have an ashram how are we going to have ?

688
00:55:52,138 --> 00:55:54,889
But we still indulge into things.

689
00:56:02,681 --> 00:56:07,014
So this is what is the Gurupada.

690
00:56:07,056 --> 00:56:12,931
This Sir has to sit down, make an space for him.

691
00:56:12,973 --> 00:56:16,514
Come on, please. He doesn't need to be stand up. All right.

692
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:24,305
So today is such a great day of Guru Nanaka's birthday,

693
00:56:25,264 --> 00:56:29,430
and we have to see his own life, how he spent his own life,

694
00:56:29,764 --> 00:56:35,931
how he lived and in what conditions he managed.

695
00:56:38,138 --> 00:56:42,973
So the first thing is to look after, disciplining yourself,

696
00:56:43,556 --> 00:56:47,222
feeling responsible for Sahaja Yoga.

697
00:56:48,056 --> 00:56:52,014
I was amazed people told, me that in the ashram

698
00:56:52,056 --> 00:56:57,138
people keep the lights on, and the oil costs so much,

699
00:56:57,139 --> 00:57:02,098
300 pounds every week. I'm amazed!

700
00:57:03,389 --> 00:57:07,639
Every one of you should be responsi-be for every electricity,

701
00:57:07,639 --> 00:57:11,347
everything that you spend here. This is God's place.

702
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:19,264
Somebody has given the car, everybody wants to use the car.

703
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:21,597
You see this saving the pounds

704
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:24,056
is still going on the heads of Sahaja Yogis.

705
00:57:24,889 --> 00:57:28,056
If they can save by taking somebody's car they would borrow.

706
00:57:28,098 --> 00:57:29,514
Never borrow anybody's car.

707
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:31,889
It's not for you, you must have your self respect,

708
00:57:31,889 --> 00:57:33,556
why to borrow anybody's car?

709
00:57:33,556 --> 00:57:35,931
It's not to be done.

710
00:57:39,138 --> 00:57:42,973
So the second point of the Self is self respect.

711
00:57:43,556 --> 00:57:46,722
First is the respect of your body,

712
00:57:47,264 --> 00:57:49,806
and the second is self-respect.

713
00:57:53,556 --> 00:57:57,764
We are arrogant, we can be rude,

714
00:57:59,597 --> 00:58:01,430
but we have no self respect.

715
00:58:10,556 --> 00:58:13,722
But it is the training that is lacking,

716
00:58:14,389 --> 00:58:16,722
you see suddenly I find after war

717
00:58:16,722 --> 00:58:22,931
there has been no teaching how to be self respecting.

718
00:58:25,138 --> 00:58:30,347
Like in the war, might be, the atmosphere might have been created I don't know why - that-

719
00:58:30,347 --> 00:58:33,056
"I´m above everything, don't care for others."

720
00:58:35,973 --> 00:58:39,138
May have been; I don't know why this kind of a thing has come,

721
00:58:39,138 --> 00:58:41,264
but it is so. Very prevalent.

722
00:58:41,305 --> 00:58:43,722
But you people have to be other way round:

723
00:58:44,222 --> 00:58:47,639
'Others are first and then yourself.

724
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:49,264
With your self respect.

725
00:58:49,264 --> 00:58:52,597
Doesn't matter, nobody is going to die, I can tell you this much.

726
00:58:59,347 --> 00:59:04,305
You all must have self respect; and such mediocre people

727
00:59:04,764 --> 00:59:07,430
should not be allowed to stay in Sahaja Yoga,

728
00:59:10,138 --> 00:59:15,264
at least in the ashram, because it brings a bad name to all Sahaja Yoga.

729
00:59:15,264 --> 00:59:17,389
One person can spoil the whole.

730
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:22,222
Only people who want to be Gurus have to stay in the ashram.

731
00:59:22,264 --> 00:59:25,056
It's not going to be made a convenience for anyone.

732
00:59:27,222 --> 00:59:31,138
But the other way around is that,

733
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:33,764
"We are going to look after ourselves,

734
00:59:33,806 --> 00:59:36,889
we have to become this, we have to grow,

735
00:59:36,931 --> 00:59:38,597
we have to do it."

736
00:59:44,138 --> 00:59:48,098
Then it's just, the other way round, everything works out,

737
00:59:48,138 --> 00:59:49,973
I don't have to tell you.

738
00:59:50,014 --> 00:59:52,347
You know this is so base and so gross

739
00:59:52,806 --> 00:59:54,722
that after being here for so many years,

740
00:59:55,472 --> 01:00:00,138
you should all have become avadhutas by now, absolutely.

741
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,639
Controlling all elements, everything, should have been possible;

742
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,889
but stilI you are under the grip of the elements,

743
01:00:06,389 --> 01:00:08,305
how can you control it ?

744
01:00:15,264 --> 01:00:20,098
First of all get out of the slavery, this mental slavery.

745
01:00:22,014 --> 01:00:26,514
"Alright if it is there, it is there, if it is not there it doesn't matter.

746
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:28,389
Nothing is more important than me,

747
01:00:28,806 --> 01:00:30,514
I am the king of the whole world.

748
01:00:30,556 --> 01:00:32,681
If I have to sleep on the ground I can sleep,

749
01:00:32,681 --> 01:00:34,639
if I have to sleep in the palaces I can sleep,

750
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:38,514
nothing can dominate me." Then you are the master.

751
01:00:40,472 --> 01:00:42,806
You know in India, there are some Sahaja Yogis

752
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:48,389
who are controlling definitely controlling, elements.

753
01:00:48,931 --> 01:00:52,347
We have examples of that, lots of things have been published

754
01:00:52,389 --> 01:00:55,138
you know in Nirmala Yoga, you must have heard.

755
01:00:55,848 --> 01:00:58,139
But you meet them, you'll find they are avadhutas

756
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:00,764
and when they talk you feel a great sage is talking,

757
01:01:00,806 --> 01:01:03,430
and the way they behave, all the time you see their behaviour

758
01:01:03,472 --> 01:01:05,056
and everything is so great.

759
01:01:05,098 --> 01:01:06,764
We need people of that calibre today,

760
01:01:06,806 --> 01:01:09,472
because that is the situation of all nations.

761
01:01:12,806 --> 01:01:17,098
You have to be extra-good, because today is not a time

762
01:01:17,138 --> 01:01:20,264
when we can allow things to go, as they are.

763
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:27,098
Or we are not just disciples,

764
01:01:27,098 --> 01:01:28,973
we all have to become gurus.

765
01:01:32,014 --> 01:01:36,347
And it is not the time when you can play with time.

766
01:01:36,347 --> 01:01:42,430
You cannot play with evil. You have to surmount it.

767
01:01:42,472 --> 01:01:44,264
You have to come on top of it, it is the time

768
01:01:44,305 --> 01:01:47,014
when the whole ship is going to be drowned or saved.

769
01:01:47,056 --> 01:01:48,722
This is the situation today.

770
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:52,430
And that's why you have got your realization from God.

771
01:01:53,139 --> 01:01:55,264
If that precarious time had not arrived,

772
01:01:55,305 --> 01:01:58,305
how many of you really think you deserved it?

773
01:01:59,014 --> 01:02:04,681
But you got it, because the time is such that everybody

774
01:02:04,681 --> 01:02:08,305
must be given realization, and they must be given all powers

775
01:02:08,347 --> 01:02:10,139
so that they come up.

776
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:12,056
But if you do not open your heart,

777
01:02:12,098 --> 01:02:14,430
put all your attention to your Spirit,

778
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,639
these powers will not work out.

779
01:02:16,681 --> 01:02:18,681
None of these powers will work out in you.

780
01:02:19,514 --> 01:02:21,806
This is the problem.

781
01:02:21,806 --> 01:02:24,931
Every Guru had a command on the elements.

782
01:02:25,472 --> 01:02:27,848
Nanaka, you know definitely.

783
01:02:28,305 --> 01:02:34,305
People were sitting there and they asked him for the water

784
01:02:34,764 --> 01:02:40,472
and he put his hand on a rock and the water started pouring down.

785
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:45,138
That's why it is called Punjab, Punja :

786
01:02:45,806 --> 01:02:50,597
five; and the five rivers exist there, too.

787
01:02:54,556 --> 01:02:59,139
It is said about all of them that they had powers over the elements.

788
01:03:01,889 --> 01:03:04,098
So how much we are lacking ?

789
01:03:04,098 --> 01:03:09,514
Still we are like other people who are selling cheap things,

790
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:18,514
or who are busy making cheap things, or who are of no value.

791
01:03:19,222 --> 01:03:21,764
You are the ones who have to save the whole world.

792
01:03:23,681 --> 01:03:27,514
And the maximum of my life, blood and toil and everything,

793
01:03:27,556 --> 01:03:29,889
sweat, I've put in this land of yours.

794
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:32,556
And the time is coming for me to go.

795
01:03:33,056 --> 01:03:38,722
Only three years more are left; before that,

796
01:03:38,764 --> 01:03:41,138
I hope, we establish an ashram.

797
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:42,764
We need not pay for it,

798
01:03:42,764 --> 01:03:47,014
but, you have to be ready to occupy it,

799
01:03:47,014 --> 01:03:49,056
otherwise you cannot occupy it I can tell you,

800
01:03:49,056 --> 01:03:51,389
you cannot get any more blessings of God.

801
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:54,180
So why should God bless you ?

802
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,056
This is the point one should ask oneself.

803
01:03:56,098 --> 01:04:01,639
Are you your own Spirit or you are all else but the Spirit!

804
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:08,848
But when I say something, it just goes as a big roaring,

805
01:04:09,639 --> 01:04:12,973
I don't know if the frequency has reached your ears or not,

806
01:04:13,014 --> 01:04:15,889
but I would request you now,

807
01:04:15,931 --> 01:04:19,514
as Gavin has asked me for Guru Nanaka's day,

808
01:04:19,514 --> 01:04:21,138
I really didn't want to come.

809
01:04:21,138 --> 01:04:24,389
Because to talk of Guru Nanaka and to hear about him,

810
01:04:26,347 --> 01:04:29,138
one has to be a very great person.

811
01:04:33,305 --> 01:04:38,180
Because such a light to bear, you have to make up yourself.

812
01:04:38,222 --> 01:04:40,973
Everything else is important,

813
01:04:44,389 --> 01:04:49,305
then how can you talk of Sahaja Yoga coming there.

814
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,973
I went to America, I was surprised!

815
01:04:54,973 --> 01:04:56,848
Americans whatever it is, few people,

816
01:04:56,848 --> 01:04:59,305
but to them Sahaja Yoga is the most important thing.

817
01:04:59,347 --> 01:05:01,973
They talk of nothing but Sahaja Yoga, their life is Sahaja Yoga,

818
01:05:02,014 --> 01:05:04,722
morning till evening they are working out Sahaja Yoga,

819
01:05:04,764 --> 01:05:07,722
nothing else, they are not bothered.

820
01:05:07,722 --> 01:05:09,556
Australians you know.

821
01:05:15,014 --> 01:05:23,180
But the Heart is not open, the Spirit has not shown its light.

822
01:05:23,848 --> 01:05:31,931
It is the one that gives you complete satisfaction, complete joy,

823
01:05:32,848 --> 01:05:37,014
complete Guru's principle, because then you start giving.

824
01:05:37,056 --> 01:05:39,430
If there is no light what are you giving? Darkness ?

825
01:05:41,722 --> 01:05:43,556
What are you giving to others ?

826
01:05:44,305 --> 01:05:48,347
The darkness that is within you, if you are going to give that....

827
01:05:51,722 --> 01:06:03,098
So the second phase, has to be, as I have told you, to have self respect.

898
01:11:35,973 --> 01:11:40,722

01:11:40,764 --> 01:11:43,722

905
01:12:00,556 --> 01:12:03,973
-

906
01:12:04,014 --> 01:12:08,848
-

907
01:12:08,848 --> 01:12:11,639
-

908
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:18,848
-

909
01:12:18,848 --> 01:12:25,305
The one who out fishes and sells them in the market.

910
01:12:26,264 --> 01:12:29,722
But his body is so well built and shining

911
01:12:29,722 --> 01:12:32,681
and the muscles so developed and the man,

912
01:12:32,722 --> 01:12:34,764
he stands up and the way he talks!

913
01:12:34,764 --> 01:12:36,848
And absolutely humble person.

914
01:12:43,139 --> 01:12:45,722
No wonder Christ chose fishermen.

915
01:12:46,764 --> 01:12:51,014
While he has got thousands of fishermen as his disciples,

916
01:12:51,514 --> 01:12:53,722
but he doesn't call them disciples,

917
01:12:53,764 --> 01:12:55,098
he says they are all Mother's children.

918
01:12:55,639 --> 01:12:57,472
Thousands! You don't know.

919
01:12:57,514 --> 01:12:59,556
He has been calling me to go to them,

920
01:12:59,556 --> 01:13:01,764
and all that but they come to my programme, some of them.

921
01:13:03,098 --> 01:13:06,180
And one day I have to go down, to those islands,

922
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,681
any one of the islands he said you come they will be all there

923
01:13:08,681 --> 01:13:10,514
the whole day waiting for you.

924
01:13:10,556 --> 01:13:15,014
But the way he is there is surprising.

925
01:13:17,347 --> 01:13:21,098
When I am there he brings fishes for me.

926
01:13:21,138 --> 01:13:25,430
But I said, you see, I eat fishes that you bring

927
01:13:25,472 --> 01:13:27,681
but what about my other children.

928
01:13:27,722 --> 01:13:31,722
He said no, next time, all the fishes will be sent to you.

929
01:13:31,764 --> 01:13:33,931
And he sent one truck-load to me, you would not believe!

930
01:13:34,514 --> 01:13:37,597
I said now I don't even have truck-load of disciples,

931
01:13:37,597 --> 01:13:39,430
who is going to eat all this?

932
01:13:42,472 --> 01:13:45,347
And he said, "Nothing, I just went and told fishermen

933
01:13:45,347 --> 01:13:48,180
that Mother has asked for fishes and everybody gave their fishes.

934
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:50,014
One day they will not have fishes,

935
01:13:50,056 --> 01:13:52,138
what is there, what does it matter."

936
01:13:52,138 --> 01:13:55,848
Imagine those people who live day-to-day in that country.

937
01:13:58,848 --> 01:14:03,180
Modi told the newspaper people

938
01:14:03,222 --> 01:14:05,514
that we can control the elements

939
01:14:05,556 --> 01:14:07,264
somehow by Mother's grace.

940
01:14:07,305 --> 01:14:11,138
So the newspaper people felt they were very much boasting.

941
01:14:11,138 --> 01:14:14,389
But it is true, they can.

942
01:14:16,389 --> 01:14:20,056
To them it is not boasting it is just what it is they are seeing.

943
01:14:20,056 --> 01:14:23,139
They are telling the truth, you see.

944
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:24,639
But that should happen.

945
01:14:24,681 --> 01:14:26,347
We should also have some things

946
01:14:26,389 --> 01:14:28,222
to boast here. Important.

947
01:14:28,222 --> 01:14:32,931
So now we have the other phase as I told you,

948
01:14:32,973 --> 01:14:42,973
is of becoming the Guru of yourself.

949
01:14:43,556 --> 01:14:47,681
Detaching yourself, identifying yourself with the Spirit

950
01:14:47,722 --> 01:14:49,597
which is growing in its light.

951
01:14:51,764 --> 01:14:55,514
So detachment. One has to develop detachment.

952
01:14:56,098 --> 01:14:58,389
'My' mother, it starts like that;

953
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:04,389
my mother is suffering from cancer, my father is suffering from madness,

954
01:15:05,014 --> 01:15:06,848
Mother can you cure them ?

955
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:11,931
So now first I cure mother and father.

956
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:15,222
Then I'm married, my wife is like this,

957
01:15:15,264 --> 01:15:24,138
my child is like this then my house, then my motorcar,

958
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:27,597
then my dog, then my umbrella!

959
01:15:30,973 --> 01:15:37,806
I have to go suddenly from A to Z, from Z to A.

960
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:51,973
Alright, I can do, up to a point, but for what? For what?

961
01:15:52,556 --> 01:15:56,472
Why to cure the mother, father, brother, sisters,

962
01:15:56,472 --> 01:16:01,597
every relationship, the 10th marriage and the 11th divorce ?

963
01:16:02,138 --> 01:16:05,138
Why to correct all this? For what?

964
01:16:08,681 --> 01:16:14,347
It must have some purpose, and if that purpose cannot be served,

965
01:16:14,931 --> 01:16:17,722
what is the use of doing it?

966
01:16:18,472 --> 01:16:24,597
The purpose is that you at least leave all these things in my hands

967
01:16:25,138 --> 01:16:26,931
and detach yourself.

968
01:16:26,973 --> 01:16:30,056
But you want to bring the case to Me as well as worry about it.

969
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:33,389
Detachment.

970
01:16:35,931 --> 01:16:39,014
But the idea of detachment is this!

971
01:16:39,014 --> 01:16:42,514
"I'm very detached about money, Mother, absolutely.

972
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:45,222
I'm not bothered. I keep the lights on,

973
01:16:45,264 --> 01:16:46,889
why to worry about money ?"

974
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:50,931
This is the argument,

975
01:16:50,931 --> 01:16:55,139
"Why should we worry about looking after the gas and all that,

976
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:59,973
after all we are detached people. We are in detachment, you see.

977
01:17:00,848 --> 01:17:02,681
We are not attached to money."

978
01:17:02,848 --> 01:17:04,514
But who is going to pay ?

979
01:17:06,764 --> 01:17:11,597
The other type of detachment that. I see, very interesting one is this one:

980
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:18,264
"I'm very detached, so I'm not bothered about having a bath,

981
01:17:20,806 --> 01:17:22,514
having all kinds of diseases,

982
01:17:22,931 --> 01:17:25,556
having all kinds of problems within myself,

983
01:17:25,639 --> 01:17:28,222
giving my problems to others. I'm detached!

984
01:17:28,681 --> 01:17:32,347
Why should I cover myself ? I'm detached.

985
01:17:32,764 --> 01:17:35,014
If I get cold, I'm detached,

986
01:17:35,347 --> 01:17:37,347
let everybody get cold from me.

987
01:17:38,722 --> 01:17:40,764
What can I do, I'm detached.

988
01:17:41,305 --> 01:17:43,764
I've got cold, so what does it matter,

989
01:17:43,764 --> 01:17:45,264
I'm a detached personality.

990
01:17:45,347 --> 01:17:46,681
Why should others mind?

991
01:17:46,681 --> 01:17:48,556
They should also get detached."

992
01:17:54,222 --> 01:17:57,180
This is the ridiculous limit we can go

993
01:17:57,222 --> 01:18:03,305
in our idea of detachment! Detachment is from within.

994
01:18:03,305 --> 01:18:12,098
You are not bothered. You are not bothered.

995
01:18:12,098 --> 01:18:14,305
You know your Mother.

996
01:18:15,138 --> 01:18:18,931
The first detachment is shown in generosity.

997
01:18:19,848 --> 01:18:30,056
Detachment is generosity. Grezna is.

998
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:33,556
She sold her ornaments for nothing at all.

999
01:18:33,597 --> 01:18:35,514
I mean I would never have accepted that money,

1000
01:18:35,556 --> 01:18:38,514
but she just sold them. It's remarkable.

1001
01:18:39,056 --> 01:18:46,305
She sold them She is Polish not English. She sold her ornaments ;

1002
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:48,514
and this is what communism has done to people.

1003
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:50,180
They are very detached,

1004
01:18:50,222 --> 01:18:52,639
communists are very detached people I tell you.

1005
01:18:55,556 --> 01:19:00,764
Of course I would never take that money, that's theirs,

1006
01:19:00,806 --> 01:19:03,806
but the way she did it, just like that.

1007
01:19:03,806 --> 01:19:09,973
For God's work alright what is ornaments, take it.

1008
01:19:10,014 --> 01:19:14,931
I mean you know I've given away so many of my ornaments

1009
01:19:14,973 --> 01:19:16,931
to keep relations alright.

1010
01:19:19,556 --> 01:19:22,681
The other day I gave away my Kara to Christine,

1011
01:19:22,681 --> 01:19:24,639
you know that when she got engaged.

1012
01:19:24,639 --> 01:19:26,806
Just it came out of the hand and went away.

1013
01:19:26,848 --> 01:19:32,180
I was detached you see, I never even felt the coming out !

1014
01:19:33,722 --> 01:19:35,347
So much detached that Christine told me

1015
01:19:35,389 --> 01:19:40,098
she was cramped up with pressure but to me it was just, just nothing.

1016
01:19:40,889 --> 01:19:51,597
Dust. So that detachment has to come.

1017
01:19:51,639 --> 01:19:56,180
Now you should know which part you are there.

1018
01:19:56,180 --> 01:20:01,806
Like idea of detachment should not be

1019
01:20:01,848 --> 01:20:06,681
that - I would say hippy style of detachment,

1020
01:20:06,722 --> 01:20:08,889
that you have right to exploit everybody else.

1021
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:13,889
And the other type as I told you. which is very ridiculous.

1022
01:20:14,389 --> 01:20:17,430
It's not an idea, it's a thing,

1023
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:21,347
it's your awareness itself which is detached.

1024
01:20:28,222 --> 01:20:34,222
So, these four things for your material side is important.

1025
01:20:36,347 --> 01:20:41,973
What you eat is not so important,

1026
01:20:42,014 --> 01:20:43,389
because whatever you eat,

1027
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:45,806
if the brain is going to be such a non-sensical thing

1028
01:20:45,848 --> 01:20:49,264
it's better whether you eat it or not, makes no difference does it?

1029
01:20:49,305 --> 01:20:53,098
Analyze it, like in the hotel, what will you have,

1030
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:55,098
" I'll have pancakes," what will you have,

1031
01:20:55,098 --> 01:20:57,222
" I'll have this I'll have that", for what ?

1032
01:20:57,764 --> 01:20:59,973
I just don't understand why waste so much energy,

1033
01:21:00,014 --> 01:21:02,639
why not you all have pancakes all of you put together.

1034
01:21:03,889 --> 01:21:08,472
It's a very big thing you know. Or, today I'll have this.

1035
01:21:08,472 --> 01:21:15,514
"I". Out of all this materialism what comes out is Mr "I".

1036
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:20,014
So we develop this Mr I.

1037
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:25,014
So the word "I" must go away, we should speak "we".

1038
01:21:26,764 --> 01:21:32,264
"We" means you and all the Sahaja Yogis put together.

1039
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:38,014
When you say "we" you will find it will be different.

1040
01:21:38,014 --> 01:21:41,430
Or take your name, like "this Norman."

1041
01:21:42,472 --> 01:21:47,222
"This Norman won't listen," like children say.

1042
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:50,889
I asked a little boy, will you go home ? "

1043
01:21:51,389 --> 01:21:58,597
I will go, but this (his name was Munna) this Munna, won't go,

1044
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:09,056
he's very obstinate, what can I do ?" This is detachment.

1045
01:22:09,639 --> 01:22:12,098
To speak in third person is detachment,

1046
01:22:12,098 --> 01:22:17,597
in which you are not in the picture...

1047
01:22:17,639 --> 01:22:19,222
you are a witness.

1048
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,430
You are the witness in the show.

1049
01:22:20,472 --> 01:22:24,264
So this detachment should work in such a way

1050
01:22:24,305 --> 01:22:26,264
that you should witness the whole show,

1051
01:22:26,264 --> 01:22:27,806
you're not involved into it.

1052
01:22:27,848 --> 01:22:32,556
But just see what happens, in collectivity also.

1053
01:22:34,138 --> 01:22:36,889
It becomes a political issue certainly,

1054
01:22:36,931 --> 01:22:41,056
in Sahaja Yoga also, political issue; nothing short of political issue!

1055
01:22:41,597 --> 01:22:48,430
We are not here fighting like union leaders.

1056
01:22:49,139 --> 01:22:53,514
We are all leaders ! Where is the time to fight?

1057
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:02,098
Whom are we to fight , that we have to decide.

1058
01:23:02,681 --> 01:23:06,514
So, as far as all these things concerned,

1059
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:10,639
are detachment and attachment to Spirit.

1060
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:15,180
So we go further,

1061
01:23:15,222 --> 01:23:19,556
see now what should be our attitude on our mental level.

1062
01:23:21,305 --> 01:23:27,098
Physically you have seen that you have to develop

1063
01:23:27,098 --> 01:23:31,305
a complete detachment in these four ways that I have told you.

1064
01:23:31,931 --> 01:23:35,556
Now on your mental level what you have to do,

1065
01:23:36,305 --> 01:23:46,764
is to understand the essence of every writing,

1066
01:23:47,264 --> 01:23:52,098
try to discriminate between Vidya and avidya.

1067
01:23:52,264 --> 01:24:00,681
Because avidya will kill you, will take away your energy,

1068
01:24:01,264 --> 01:24:04,305
but vidya will sustain.

1069
01:24:04,889 --> 01:24:10,430
So try to find out books which are supporting vidya.

1070
01:24:10,889 --> 01:24:13,848
I was surprised, there is a lady Barbara,

1071
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:15,889
she met only last time Gavin,

1072
01:24:15,889 --> 01:24:19,514
and she has written such a tremendous book, you'd be amazed!

1073
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:24,681
I mean of such a level on Sahaja Yoga ! Very direct.

1074
01:24:24,722 --> 01:24:29,222
I'll show you that, and you know that book is now being considered

1075
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:32,514
for giving her a.doctorate, can you believe it I

1076
01:24:32,514 --> 01:24:34,430
In an American university;

1077
01:24:34,472 --> 01:24:36,056
of course that's only possible in America.

1078
01:24:36,098 --> 01:24:42,098
But still that book has that level,

1079
01:24:42,098 --> 01:24:44,014
I was amazed at the book!

1080
01:24:44,056 --> 01:24:50,597
So try to gather nourishment, like reading Devi Mahatmya,

1081
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:53,138
reading about, finding out about Bible

1082
01:24:53,139 --> 01:24:57,389
and finding about other scriptures, about Koran - this that,

1083
01:24:57,430 --> 01:25:00,848
and which supports you, which nourishes you.

1084
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:10,764
Blake, Kabir, Nanaka. I mean there are so many, Laotze.

1085
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:15,889
This is the good - is the knowledge. But you'll be amazed,

1086
01:25:15,889 --> 01:25:18,430
once you start doing it, it comes to you.

1087
01:25:18,430 --> 01:25:25,347
I met a man near Rahuri - as you know we go there,

1088
01:25:28,138 --> 01:25:31,889
and there's a man who just drives a bullock cart,

1089
01:25:32,681 --> 01:25:36,722
and he had brought the bullock cart to take me down

1090
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:39,848
to one of the programmes, you know what we do there.

1091
01:25:39,848 --> 01:25:43,138
And he was sitting there, we were waiting, I was talking, to him.

1092
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:46,056
And I felt an Avadhuta is sitting there to drive me,

1093
01:25:46,056 --> 01:25:49,639
I mean uneducated absolutely, he's never known books,

1094
01:25:49,681 --> 01:25:52,180
he does not know how to write, but the way he was talking I said,

1095
01:25:52,222 --> 01:25:55,305
"Oh God, from where this knowledge!

1096
01:26:00,389 --> 01:26:03,098
From where was all this coming, this wisdom!

1097
01:26:03,138 --> 01:26:04,848
Such wisdom, I tell you!''

1098
01:26:05,514 --> 01:26:09,305
Such wisdom that I was just stunned, I was stunned really!

1099
01:26:09,347 --> 01:26:13,597
From a man who is not even been to any school-college.

1100
01:26:13,639 --> 01:26:15,931
Christ did not go to any school or college.

1101
01:26:17,973 --> 01:26:20,014
Such wisdom, you can't imagine.

1102
01:26:20,056 --> 01:26:22,180
You meet him next time when you go there.

1103
01:26:22,806 --> 01:26:27,889
If somebody could translate him... you feel like touching his feet

1104
01:26:27,889 --> 01:26:30,639
the way - extremely unassuming simple man,

1105
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:37,931
wearing a white, clean topi and clean dress and driving me down.

1106
01:26:38,139 --> 01:26:41,597
And to him this was the greatest privilege of the whole world --

1107
01:26:41,639 --> 01:26:44,931
is to drive me; he said "It must be the greatest of all --

1108
01:26:44,973 --> 01:26:47,597
something I must have done - to be able to drive you."

1109
01:26:48,139 --> 01:26:52,014
And in such simple ways he was explaining to me

1110
01:26:52,014 --> 01:26:55,098
about the character of the bullocks and the human beings --

1111
01:26:55,681 --> 01:26:59,681
just imagine! And the things he talked about,

1112
01:26:59,722 --> 01:27:02,430
if I tell you, you won't believe - so I just don't know...

1113
01:27:03,305 --> 01:27:09,681
That's the sign of a great man, he doesn't talk of frivolous things,

1114
01:27:09,681 --> 01:27:11,764
he has no time to talk about frivolous things.

1115
01:27:11,764 --> 01:27:13,347
I have seen my own grandchildren --

1116
01:27:13,389 --> 01:27:15,514
they never talk of frivolous things, they have no time,

1117
01:27:15,514 --> 01:27:17,056
they are busy, you know.

1118
01:27:17,056 --> 01:27:19,639
All the time clearing out, when they came here, they said

1119
01:27:19,639 --> 01:27:21,305
"We have to clear out this Brompton Square,

1120
01:27:21,347 --> 01:27:23,430
then we have to clear out this Knights bridge,

1121
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:25,056
then we have to clear out this London,

1122
01:27:25,098 --> 01:27:26,848
then we have to clear out this England.

1123
01:27:26,889 --> 01:27:28,389
Where is the map of England, bring it,"

1124
01:27:28,389 --> 01:27:31,014
all the time they were busy, you see, clearing out, and then,

1125
01:27:31,056 --> 01:27:32,514
"this place is this, this place is this.

1126
01:27:32,514 --> 01:27:34,347
Oh God this horrible,

1127
01:27:34,347 --> 01:27:36,098
bring some shoes, do this do that,"

1128
01:27:36,098 --> 01:27:38,639
all the time they were busy morning till evening.

1129
01:27:38,681 --> 01:27:41,597
They would go upstairs in the room and they are busy.

1130
01:27:41,639 --> 01:27:43,389
They are busy people, they have no time to talk

1131
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:44,973
of the mundane things and all that.

1132
01:27:44,973 --> 01:27:47,098
Then I brought some dolls and toys, for them.

1133
01:27:47,138 --> 01:27:51,180
They put all of them there and they put them, and the map there,

1134
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:55,138
"now see now, (to dolls) now you look after, alright ?"

1135
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:58,597
You know they're talking to dolls like that.

1136
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:00,556
Dolls are their disciples. Teaching the dolls,

1137
01:28:00,597 --> 01:28:04,347
"you see, don't sit like this, you must sit properly, you don't know.

1138
01:28:04,347 --> 01:28:05,931
You can't bend your knees ?

1139
01:28:05,973 --> 01:28:07,973
Better learn that, you must learn to bend your knees,"

1140
01:28:08,014 --> 01:28:10,597
because dolls have straight legs!

1141
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:18,681
And all the boys, even the little children,

1142
01:28:18,722 --> 01:28:21,764
I have seen the way they are busy all the time doing Sahaja Yoga.

1143
01:28:24,264 --> 01:28:28,305
Every level they are working.

1144
01:28:29,556 --> 01:28:35,222
As today I was telling Rustom about my own father.

1145
01:28:36,056 --> 01:28:38,014
You see, he was a learned man, of course.

1146
01:28:38,014 --> 01:28:42,931
But when he talked, he used to talk of something,

1147
01:28:42,931 --> 01:28:47,931
like I told him about the state of a person, called Sambhranta.

1148
01:28:48,514 --> 01:28:53,014
He told me that, "Human beings are very different from God.

1149
01:28:53,514 --> 01:28:57,180
When God incarnates then the Sambhranta state,

1150
01:28:57,222 --> 01:28:59,973
which is awakening between the subconscious

1151
01:29:00,014 --> 01:29:05,931
to the conscious state, is direct, you see.

1152
01:29:05,931 --> 01:29:08,139
He comes down directly But human beings

1153
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:12,889
go this way, they never go straight.

1154
01:29:13,389 --> 01:29:15,931
See God descends, so he descends properly,

1155
01:29:15,973 --> 01:29:18,889
but ascent is always in a very separate way.

1156
01:29:18,931 --> 01:29:21,556
It goes on like this, and he gathers everything

1157
01:29:21,597 --> 01:29:25,347
that is in his subconscious, so the Sambhranta state,

1158
01:29:25,389 --> 01:29:28,681
where he is waking up, is such a dangerous thing

1159
01:29:28,681 --> 01:29:30,222
that he can gather up anything.

1160
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:33,889
And by the time he gathers up the dreams he becomes something so funny.

1161
01:29:33,973 --> 01:29:38,848
He may look at God whom he has seen in his dream

1162
01:29:38,889 --> 01:29:42,180
like a witch, and the witch like a bird."

1163
01:29:42,806 --> 01:29:51,472
I saw him always busy. I mean to talk to him,

1164
01:29:51,472 --> 01:29:55,722
I found a companion and he found me a companion sort of a thing.

1165
01:29:55,764 --> 01:29:58,098
He could talk, because his attention was there.

1166
01:29:58,098 --> 01:30:01,014
His attention was not how every body has made their hair,

1167
01:30:01,014 --> 01:30:04,514
and how they are sitting down or what dresses they are making,

1168
01:30:04,556 --> 01:30:06,681
or what do you have in this thing - nothing.

1169
01:30:06,722 --> 01:30:12,514
His attention was on the Spirit, his own Spirit and Spirit of others.

1170
01:30:12,556 --> 01:30:20,180
And he was so dynamic in his brain that he knew your dictionary

1171
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:21,430
by heart, I tell you.

1172
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:23,639
He never consulted dictionary all his life --

1173
01:30:23,639 --> 01:30:27,639
neither Sanskrit nor English, and he was master of 14 languages.

1174
01:30:27,639 --> 01:30:33,764
Can you imagine! How he must have managed!

1175
01:30:33,806 --> 01:30:37,389
He used to play tennis very well, he used to swim for 3 miles every day.

1176
01:30:37,389 --> 01:30:40,931
3 miles. He had muscles that he could just lift you up. Yes!

1177
01:30:43,889 --> 01:30:48,430
Very healthy personality, healthy man.

1178
01:30:48,472 --> 01:30:50,931
Very generous, very generous.

1179
01:30:50,973 --> 01:30:53,389
Much more generous than me, so you can imagine.

1180
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:55,931
Very generous, to him nothing mattered,

1181
01:30:55,973 --> 01:30:57,639
"alright you like it, take it".

1182
01:30:57,639 --> 01:31:01,222
He'll starve himself but he'll be generous.

1183
01:31:01,264 --> 01:31:05,139
And a man of principle.

1184
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:10,764
So we come to the second point which is actually

1185
01:31:10,806 --> 01:31:13,556
we have started the fifth one - which is mentally

1186
01:31:13,597 --> 01:31:18,222
you must only take to things which are nourishing.

1187
01:31:22,347 --> 01:31:24,222
Through vibratory awareness you will know.

1188
01:31:24,222 --> 01:31:28,430
Ask other Sahaja Yogis, if you do not know.

1189
01:31:28,848 --> 01:31:31,430
But take nourishing things to read and not horrible,

1190
01:31:31,472 --> 01:31:33,722
detrimental to your growth.

1191
01:31:33,764 --> 01:31:36,305
If you read them, you are responsible:

1192
01:31:36,347 --> 01:31:41,180
You are real great readers I must say --

1193
01:31:41,222 --> 01:31:43,514
you ask any name, everyone knows.

1194
01:31:43,556 --> 01:31:45,347
I said who was Gropius, everyone knows.

1195
01:31:45,389 --> 01:31:47,222
You need not be an academician to tell.

1196
01:31:47,222 --> 01:31:50,889
Everyone knows, what happened, who is this, who is that.

1197
01:31:50,889 --> 01:31:53,973
Out of your seeking you have done one good thing --

1198
01:31:54,014 --> 01:31:56,430
to have read everything whether good or bad,

1199
01:31:56,430 --> 01:31:58,305
whatever it is.

1200
01:31:58,347 --> 01:32:00,639
But now after realisation, you must try to find out

1201
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:03,138
what you have to read, what you have to know,

1202
01:32:03,138 --> 01:32:04,889
it should be nourishing.

1203
01:32:04,889 --> 01:32:08,848
Talk that is nourishing, helpful.

1204
01:32:08,889 --> 01:32:14,472
So in talk you should have compassion.

1205
01:32:14,472 --> 01:32:19,222
If you are talking to someone you should be full of compassion.

1206
01:32:19,264 --> 01:32:21,430
Sahaja Yoga is a system of compassion.

1207
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:26,098
A Guru has to be very-very patient.

1208
01:32:26,138 --> 01:32:29,347
It is not like other Gurudom,

1209
01:32:29,764 --> 01:32:32,597
or even real Gurus had no patience.

1210
01:32:33,472 --> 01:32:38,806
This is a system where patience is the only way it will work out,

1211
01:32:38,848 --> 01:32:41,014
because no Gurus gave realisation, it is only you

1212
01:32:41,014 --> 01:32:43,472
who have to give it. And you know what is realisation.

1213
01:32:43,514 --> 01:32:48,138
The other day we met one; the fellow sitting tight.

1214
01:32:48,139 --> 01:32:56,056
They said, "We have failed Mother, we can't give him realisation,

1215
01:32:56,098 --> 01:32:57,806
it's a hopeless case". I said, "Really ?"

1216
01:32:57,806 --> 01:33:00,889
So I went there - at the end of it you see, they said,

1217
01:33:00,931 --> 01:33:02,347
"Mother there's one fellow sitting".

1218
01:33:02,389 --> 01:33:05,430
I wanted to aviod, you see, but they said.

1219
01:33:05,472 --> 01:33:11,722
Alright, so raised his Kundalini, raised it up, tied it up,

1220
01:33:11,764 --> 01:33:16,931
my hands bearing now. "Oh no, I didn't feel anything".

1221
01:33:16,973 --> 01:33:23,931
I said, this fellow is least bothered

1222
01:33:23,973 --> 01:33:26,138
how much we are working on him!

1223
01:33:26,139 --> 01:33:28,138
He's just thinking he's obliging us."

1224
01:33:28,138 --> 01:33:31,556
So then two or three people came forward, brought a light,

1225
01:33:31,556 --> 01:33:35,014
put the light before him, did bandhan here and everything:

1226
01:33:35,056 --> 01:33:38,973
Again I raised his Kundalini thrice:

1227
01:33:39,014 --> 01:33:44,889
"No, not at all... ! "it went on like that for half an hour,

1228
01:33:44,889 --> 01:33:46,222
then I gave up. I said,

1229
01:33:46,264 --> 01:33:48,014
"Sir, I'm sorry, you are too great

1230
01:33:48,014 --> 01:33:52,347
for realisation! We'll try again".

1231
01:33:52,347 --> 01:33:58,639
"I'm not convinced..." And I was fagged out,

1232
01:33:58,681 --> 01:34:02,139
I said "Really, I am convinced about you,

1233
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:04,764
so, you allow us to go", and then I came out.

1234
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:07,889
You have to have 'tremendous' patience and sense of humour --

1235
01:34:07,931 --> 01:34:09,806
you just can't tell him off.

1236
01:34:09,848 --> 01:34:12,222
You see if I told him ''You are good for nothing, useless,

1237
01:34:12,222 --> 01:34:16,806
you have a bad Kundalini you go away from here get away, get lost."

1238
01:34:16,806 --> 01:34:23,556
I couldn't say these things to him, I had to bear him through and not only,

1239
01:34:23,556 --> 01:34:26,764
in the end I had to say you are a great man, you see.

1240
01:34:26,806 --> 01:34:29,889
Because otherwise he would have used some other method.

1241
01:34:29,889 --> 01:34:32,597
Because, already the ego was so big

1242
01:34:32,597 --> 01:34:35,889
that with all the pins I put inside it, it could not deflate,

1243
01:34:35,889 --> 01:34:38,722
it was made of a special fibre I think !

1244
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:45,014
It was such a difficult task.

1245
01:34:45,056 --> 01:34:48,347
So one has to know that we have to be compassionate.

1246
01:34:48,389 --> 01:34:53,014
We have to read something that nourishes our compassion.

1247
01:34:53,056 --> 01:34:58,138
Read of people who gave away everything that they had.

1248
01:34:58,139 --> 01:35:04,597
Tukarama. Read Tukarama. Tukarama was a poor man.

1249
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:09,389
And one day he went to some place and did some good job,

1250
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:14,973
so they gave him lots of sugar cane.

1251
01:35:15,347 --> 01:35:17,889
His children were very fond of sugar cane.

1252
01:35:18,931 --> 01:35:21,931
So on the way every child would ask, "give me one sugar cane".

1253
01:35:21,973 --> 01:35:23,389
He was giving to everyone.

1254
01:35:23,389 --> 01:35:25,180
When he came home only one was left.

1255
01:35:25,222 --> 01:35:27,722
So the children said, "we are three".

1256
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:31,014
He said, "It's alright; next time I will bring for you,

1257
01:35:31,056 --> 01:35:34,889
share it among you three". And they had it,

1258
01:35:34,931 --> 01:35:37,764
they said, "better have it, now one more child will come

1259
01:35:37,764 --> 01:35:39,389
and this will also go away".

1260
01:35:41,931 --> 01:35:45,806
So one has to know about lives who have been giving.

1261
01:35:47,264 --> 01:35:50,347
Read about people who have been giving.

1262
01:35:51,014 --> 01:35:57,056
They gave their lives. They crucified them, they tortured them.

1263
01:35:57,098 --> 01:35:59,264
They allowed to be exploited.

1264
01:35:59,305 --> 01:36:01,347
They allowed to be poisoned.

1265
01:36:01,347 --> 01:36:05,514
Head of such sacrifice, of great sacrifices.

1266
01:36:05,556 --> 01:36:08,722
We are lucky people that we have seen all those things

1267
01:36:08,764 --> 01:36:10,264
with our own eyes.

1268
01:36:10,264 --> 01:36:13,722
But at least you be one of them, that you can at least,

1269
01:36:13,764 --> 01:36:19,264
if not see, visualise it. You can. Bring that as your principle.

1270
01:36:19,305 --> 01:36:25,556
So we move now, from detachment,

1271
01:36:25,597 --> 01:36:29,472
which I've told you four types of detachment,

1272
01:36:29,514 --> 01:36:35,389
and then I told you the nourishment of your mind

1273
01:36:36,138 --> 01:36:38,848
and nourishment to your heart.

1274
01:36:39,305 --> 01:36:46,014
Nothing nourishes more to a person than giving away.

1275
01:36:46,514 --> 01:36:51,389
Nothing nourishes your heart, your compassion,

1276
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:53,597
unless and until you learn to give away.

1277
01:36:53,764 --> 01:36:56,014
Now will you please make a list of things,

1278
01:36:56,014 --> 01:37:02,056
"how many things you have given away in this one year, last one year".

1279
01:37:02,098 --> 01:37:03,806
I can't because it is too much.

1280
01:37:06,556 --> 01:37:10,639
Please make a list of things, "how many things",

1281
01:37:10,681 --> 01:37:15,056
except for your brains you have given away to others

1282
01:37:15,681 --> 01:37:21,472
without thinking about it, or have thought of giving.

1283
01:37:25,639 --> 01:37:29,597
Since Christmas let us say, to this Christmas.

1284
01:37:34,806 --> 01:37:42,806
Heart is opening. Think of giving.

1285
01:37:44,264 --> 01:37:50,430
On material level, other help is there to give.

1286
01:37:50,472 --> 01:37:55,514
But no, we don't even give the other help,

1287
01:37:55,931 --> 01:37:58,389
for which you don't have to spend any money.

1288
01:37:58,430 --> 01:38:00,056
Just give a hand.

1289
01:38:00,722 --> 01:38:04,848
I have seen, very easy to make out,

1290
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:07,597
labour saving devices.

1291
01:38:09,639 --> 01:38:13,681
Now, I have come here, some will be running,

1292
01:38:13,722 --> 01:38:15,556
others are just sitting.

1293
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:19,138
Tea is brought to them, food is brought of them everything is done.

1294
01:38:19,139 --> 01:38:22,556
They'll just put the plate also before: go and wash.

1295
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:35,138
Its not only selfishness but it is unmannerly, unmannerly to be like this.

1296
01:38:38,973 --> 01:38:45,347
In Sahaja Yoga you have to be

1297
01:38:45,347 --> 01:38:50,139
extremely busy helping others,

1298
01:38:50,931 --> 01:38:54,180
at every point. To be helpful.

1299
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:58,764
You know Ravi Shankar's Guru was a very great,

1300
01:38:59,764 --> 01:39:04,806
a very great man, a realized soul. He was a great person.

1301
01:39:04,806 --> 01:39:06,305
So he knew so many things.

1302
01:39:06,889 --> 01:39:12,139
And one day I was there, in the night you see, there was a doctor,

1303
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:16,806
we were his guests in a way, for dinner we had gone there.

1304
01:39:17,138 --> 01:39:18,848
In the night the call came that,

1305
01:39:18,889 --> 01:39:21,138
"I need you very much" to the doctor.

1306
01:39:21,138 --> 01:39:22,639
The doctor said, "Now I'm tired".

1307
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:24,973
He was another very giving person, no doubt.

1308
01:39:24,973 --> 01:39:27,222
He said, "Oh you must come, I have a big problem.

1309
01:39:27,222 --> 01:39:31,056
See I saw a little baby."

1310
01:39:31,098 --> 01:39:33,764
He said, "What baby have you found ?"

1311
01:39:33,806 --> 01:39:36,056
He said, "its a baby," he was an old man,

1312
01:39:36,098 --> 01:39:41,722
he said, "I found a baby of a deer which is suffering now,

1313
01:39:41,722 --> 01:39:45,098
and the mother is dead and nobody is to look after it."

1314
01:39:45,098 --> 01:39:49,139
So I said "Alright I'll also come with you",

1315
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:52,472
because I knew I will touch the baby. I went with him.

1316
01:39:52,514 --> 01:40:00,305
So, he was sitting with the little thing near his heart.

1317
01:40:00,347 --> 01:40:03,389
So the doctor said, "What are you doing ?"

1318
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:07,014
He said, "I'm trying to give him my life if possible,

1319
01:40:07,014 --> 01:40:10,556
so that when you come at least you find him alive".

1320
01:40:10,597 --> 01:40:12,931
Just like this, just love.

1321
01:40:12,931 --> 01:40:18,222
So he took out the thing - doctor - his coat and all that,

1322
01:40:18,264 --> 01:40:20,264
and he said, "alright put it down".

1323
01:40:20,305 --> 01:40:22,472
He put it down very cautiously.

1324
01:40:22,514 --> 01:40:24,222
I mean he was a realized soul, no doubt.

1325
01:40:24,222 --> 01:40:28,305
I put my hand on the thing and it came to life,

1326
01:40:28,347 --> 01:40:30,931
and it started, alright, he was very happy.

1327
01:40:30,973 --> 01:40:35,472
He said, "You are a Devi, you are a Goddess, I can tell you.

1328
01:40:35,514 --> 01:40:37,556
But one bad thing you have done." I said "What ? "

1329
01:40:37,597 --> 01:40:41,098
You are married." I said, "But Devis must marry, also."

1330
01:40:41,138 --> 01:40:44,014
He said, "No, supposing you have married a miserly man,

1331
01:40:44,014 --> 01:40:45,556
then what will happen to you ?"

1332
01:40:45,597 --> 01:40:48,347
I said, "I will see to it that, I don't marry a miserly man.

1333
01:40:50,389 --> 01:40:53,514
That would be the greatest curse."

1334
01:40:53,556 --> 01:40:56,056
He said, "I had the same type of a wife who was miserly,

1335
01:40:56,098 --> 01:40:58,764
and I got fed up with her for her miserliness."

1336
01:40:59,722 --> 01:41:03,264
So that is what it is : miserliness should be hated,

1337
01:41:03,305 --> 01:41:09,806
absolutely to be hated, absolutely to be the worst of all.

1338
01:41:09,806 --> 01:41:13,264
It's like leprosy for Sahaja Yogis. Miserliness.

1339
01:41:13,264 --> 01:41:15,514
It's saving saving pounds, you know.

1340
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:20,848
That must go away from your mind,

1341
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:28,764
Miserliness to yourself is good, miserliness to others is bad.

1342
01:41:28,806 --> 01:41:31,264
Gregoire told me a shocking thing.

1343
01:41:31,305 --> 01:41:33,138
He said, "this is our culture."

1344
01:41:33,139 --> 01:41:35,138
I said "Your culture ! what is it ?"

1345
01:41:35,597 --> 01:41:39,222
You see, he said that "if we go in a hotel, and if somebody is paying,

1346
01:41:39,264 --> 01:41:41,014
we start looking this side and that."

1347
01:41:41,056 --> 01:41:43,931
I said, "Really !". He said, that is very common.

1348
01:41:49,514 --> 01:41:51,681
I just cannot believe it ! This is culture!

1349
01:41:51,722 --> 01:41:54,722
It is the opposite of culture. Whatever you may call it,

1350
01:41:54,764 --> 01:41:58,139
it's not culture at all. Culture would be to come forward,

1351
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:01,931
"Alright I'll pay". But Americans are even worse, they'll say,

1352
01:42:01,973 --> 01:42:04,597
"I paid for you yesterday, you pay today for me."

1353
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:10,222
It's absolutely disgraceful miserliness.

1354
01:42:10,973 --> 01:42:14,472
But this is gracious; you see when somebody is paying,

1355
01:42:14,472 --> 01:42:17,264
you look on the other side. It may be gracious, I don't know,

1356
01:42:18,681 --> 01:42:23,180
whatever it is, it's just the same ; filth I tell you.

1357
01:42:23,222 --> 01:42:26,389
So compassion ; compassion at any point.

1358
01:42:26,389 --> 01:42:28,806
You may have to work till 2 o'clock, you may .

1359
01:42:28,848 --> 01:42:30,722
have to work at 4 o'clock, doesn't matter.

1360
01:42:30,764 --> 01:42:32,806
You have to work, you have to work, you have to work;

1361
01:42:32,848 --> 01:42:36,098
because compassion itself is joy giving,

1362
01:42:36,098 --> 01:42:41,222
because your Spirit is the Ocean of Compassion.

1363
01:42:41,222 --> 01:42:47,848
There is no other way, there is no other way

1364
01:42:47,848 --> 01:42:52,138
to enjoy your Spirit but to Give, to Give, to Give.

1365
01:42:52,139 --> 01:42:54,681
Doesn't matter if you have not eaten your food, doesn't matter.

1366
01:42:54,722 --> 01:42:58,056
Nothing matters.

1367
01:42:59,556 --> 01:43:05,098
Many a times a you know that I don't have food for 24 hours sometimes,

1368
01:43:05,138 --> 01:43:06,889
still I am giving.

1369
01:43:06,931 --> 01:43:09,681
Its not necessary for this body to eat,

1370
01:43:09,722 --> 01:43:14,222
the food of this body is compassion. That nourishes.

1371
01:43:16,472 --> 01:43:19,347
So you have to be miserly towards yourself,

1372
01:43:19,389 --> 01:43:21,222
but you must have compassion.

1373
01:43:22,764 --> 01:43:25,389
Heart, open your heart.

1374
01:43:26,138 --> 01:43:30,681
Open your heart first of all, for thankfulness.

1375
01:43:34,806 --> 01:43:38,597
This is the other quality one should have.

1376
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:42,514
It's a higher quality I should say, of thankfulness to God.

1377
01:43:42,556 --> 01:43:45,597
He has given you realization. He has given you this body.

1378
01:43:45,639 --> 01:43:47,681
Do you realize that this body,

1379
01:43:47,722 --> 01:43:49,389
human body He has given to you.

1380
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:51,931
He has given you everything. Count your blessings.

1381
01:43:52,973 --> 01:43:56,889
Even to have the morning, to enjoy it as a human being.

1382
01:43:58,138 --> 01:44:01,931
You are not in any bandhan, you are not in any pasha,

1383
01:44:01,973 --> 01:44:04,222
you are not pashus, you are not animals.

1384
01:44:04,264 --> 01:44:05,889
Animals are pashus.

1385
01:44:05,889 --> 01:44:08,139
You are free people, God has given you freedom.

1386
01:44:09,098 --> 01:44:15,472
And he has given you His realization. Sense of thankfulness.

1387
01:44:15,472 --> 01:44:19,014
But our language is such, "thank you, thank you, thank you," finished.

1388
01:44:19,056 --> 01:44:22,639
It is only in the lips, it finishes; lipservice.

1389
01:44:23,305 --> 01:44:30,056
From your heart thank Him, from your heart.

1390
01:44:30,098 --> 01:44:34,472
Not outside just go to church, "thank you. God very much,"

1391
01:44:34,514 --> 01:44:36,764
alright done, finished.

1392
01:44:40,098 --> 01:44:51,098
It's to thank Him from your heart, write praise. Praise.

1393
01:44:51,138 --> 01:45:00,222
Sing praise, "glory to God." to the great who has created us.

1394
01:45:00,889 --> 01:45:04,472
Your disciples are sitting and every moment

1395
01:45:04,472 --> 01:45:08,347
when you are talking you are thinking about Mother or about God.

1396
01:45:08,389 --> 01:45:16,389
You'll be amazed! It's only possible if you have sensitivity,

1397
01:45:17,848 --> 01:45:26,305
if you have memory. The greatest miracle of this world

1398
01:45:26,347 --> 01:45:30,639
is that everybody has to die and nobody remembers it.

1399
01:45:31,472 --> 01:45:35,138
But another one, is that everybody is blessed by God

1400
01:45:35,138 --> 01:45:37,139
but nobody knows it.

1401
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:41,722
But you are so specially blessed.

1402
01:45:47,014 --> 01:45:49,973
So what you should do ?

1403
01:45:51,139 --> 01:45:59,014
Be in joy, be grateful, so that bliss comes to you.

1404
01:46:00,764 --> 01:46:04,472
Without thankfulness nothing is going to work out.

1405
01:46:04,514 --> 01:46:07,556
Thankful heart.

1406
01:46:07,597 --> 01:46:12,514
You need a heart that is thankful to God so that he gives you.

1407
01:46:12,556 --> 01:46:15,639
When you give others he will definitely give.

1408
01:46:15,681 --> 01:46:17,889
But don't think it is your own.

1409
01:46:20,722 --> 01:46:24,848
You are giving what God has given you.

1410
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:32,222
So today I have told you 8-fold movement.

1411
01:46:32,222 --> 01:46:36,472
So you have become half moon, only in mind.

1412
01:46:37,764 --> 01:46:44,556
And the other half, keep it for the next 'Guru Purnima'. Alright ?

1413
01:46:44,597 --> 01:46:47,848
MAY GOD BLESS YOU
