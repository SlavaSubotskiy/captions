3
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:41,199

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:48,390
guru to whatever you have all the

5
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:48,390
precious things within you he discovers

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,960
them for your knowledge

7
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:11,580

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:19,670
the joy is there like time

10
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,229
is all contained within you

11
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,189
only thing the guru does

12
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:52,409
makes you knowledgeable about your

13
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:59,789
knowledge about your own spirit everyone

14
00:01:52,409 --> 00:02:04,700
has the spirit within himself everyone

15
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:09,390
has the spirituality within yourself

16
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:13,319
there is nothing that you get from

17
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:17,250
outside but before getting this

18
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:26,780
knowledge you are dealing or you are

19
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:32,280
living in ignorance in that ignorance

20
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:38,040
you do not know what clay here you have

21
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:43,470
got within ear so the Guru's job is to

22
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:48,950
make you know what you are that

23
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,950
sensation that you should know your

24
00:02:51,080 --> 00:03:01,400
but means you know yourself you know

25
00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:05,570
party the experience is not so she the

26
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:12,020
knowledge has to come and the Guru gives

27
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:16,670
the knowledge about yourself now you

28
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:20,690
have to tell it you should find out

29
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,500
whatever your guru has to it is it true

30
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:28,360
or not

31
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,360
is it correct or not when we talk about

32
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:37,340
realization one has to do first of all

33
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:44,390
that we have to have patience with

34
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:46,510
ourselves I know some people don't feel

35
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:51,080
so good

36
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:52,880
some people still have sicknesses some

37
00:03:51,080 --> 00:04:00,050
people don't even feel vibration

38
00:03:52,880 --> 00:04:02,300
sometimes have patience with you when

39
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:07,670
you become your own guru first thing as

40
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:12,459
the Guru has patience with his or her

41
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,459
disciple you must have patience

42
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:28,840
in that patience you will learn that you

43
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:31,319
can tolerate so many things without any

44
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,319
club

45
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:39,000
they say one person who goes on grudging

46
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:39,000
oh this is not good that is not good

47
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:51,159
because they have no patience with

48
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:56,400
themselves if you have patience with

49
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:56,400
yourself everything you'll accept

50
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:05,009
wherever you are you are with yourself

51
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:09,629
cause you're realized Souls so you want

52
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:09,629
the state to not get angry

53
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:19,740
and also you not go on crumbling than

54
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:27,149
clutching because you are enjoying

55
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:32,039
yourself so for such people who have

56
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:33,659
imaginary miseries of the past which do

57
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:37,379
not exist in reality

58
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:46,139
they cannot have the joy of reality they

59
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:50,119
can so for a sahaja yogi is important

60
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,119
that he should have joy

61
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:10,070
within his heart it's like an ocean it's

62
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:21,550
like an ocean which is there all the

63
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:21,550
time to give you such trees

64
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:36,319
even little drops of this ocean when

65
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:41,180
they trickle down in your being it is so

66
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:48,979
soothing the experience can be only

67
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:55,509
experienced it's all waiting within

68
00:06:48,979 --> 00:07:00,110
yourself so I sahaja Yogi's and as gurus

69
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:01,099
we have to love ourselves and understand

70
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,969
our own wagon

71
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:08,360
I think sahaja Yogi's have not yet

72
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:15,560
understood their worth how many people

73
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:21,199
in this world can give realization how

74
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:23,930
many know about Kundalini so this is

75
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:29,990
what is to remember that you are a

76
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:33,919
sahaja yogi take abandon owning and

77
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:38,120
ending it's so simple even to say on the

78
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:41,479
mind it seems stupid to me but I have to

79
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,599
say because people forget you forget

80
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:47,629
that you are realizes use your vibratory

81
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:50,139
awareness for at least protecting

82
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:50,139
yourself

83
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,740
because there is negativity sitting next

84
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:01,550
to her so they're very careful about

85
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,960
this to remember that I am a sahaja yoga

86
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,110
once you say that you will know how you

87
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,580
have to behave what is the protocol you

88
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,010
will know what is the discipline you

89
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:18,410
have to follow you will know how to love

90
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:20,670
others everything this is the essence

91
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:23,580
that will give you complete confidence

92
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:29,580
in yourself and will be absolutely

93
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:34,800
secure try to establish the state that

94
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:38,370
you are sahaja yoga thus you become

95
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,190
gurus of yourself and of others I hope

96
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:45,780
we will understand as a guru what you

97
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:49,740
have to do as a guru there's so many

98
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:53,940

100
00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:04,730
about the Masters how they were about

101
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:09,990
about turmoil about jealousy about

102
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:12,510
talking loose they are so great they are

103
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:16,260

and you will be the Guru's if you try to

105
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:24,000
do this what you hope to achieve I know

106
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:28,080
somehow achieve it but most of you have

107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,320
to achieve with compassion and may about

108
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,320
this

109
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:53,670
