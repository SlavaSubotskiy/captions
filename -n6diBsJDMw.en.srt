May 31, 1990

3
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:50,150
I bow to all the seekers of truth.
As you are seekers of truth, whatever one

4
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:17,189
may tell you, you should not accept it, to
begin with. People can claim anything but

5
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:31,090
that doesn’t mean that you must believe
into it, but one must know that truth is what

6
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:44,969
it is. We cannot organize it, we cannot maneuver
it, and we cannot create it. It is and it

7
00:01:53,459 --> 00:02:00,459
was and it will be, and I told you yesterday
what is the truth, and the truth is that you

8
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:11,590
are the Spirit.

9
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:19,810
You are not this body, you are not these conditionings,
your ego, your emotions, you are the Spirit.

10
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,980
This is one thing, and then there is a subtle
power, living power, power of God’s love

11
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:51,610
that does all the living work, all the evolutionally
work, all the creation and all the comforting

12
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:06,489
and joyous things, which we do not feel, about
which people have talked in every scripture.

13
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:20,439
Like in the Bible, we say, is the “all-pervading
power of God”, or in Koran they call it

14
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:27,439
[sounds like MUDRAN], in Sanskrit language
it is called as Paramchaitanya. In every religion,

15
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:39,939
in every scripture which is sensible it’s
written about it. So the first thing one has

16
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,400
to do is to feel that power, unless and until
you can feel that power you cannot understand

17
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:02,090
any religion nor the people who came as incarnations
or as prophets, or as saints, and that is

18
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:14,319
the reason why all the saints had to suffer,
all the incarnations had to suffer, because

19
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:21,609
the people in general never knew there is
a subtle power of God’s love. As we say

20
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:37,220
there is God the Father, God the Son, there
has to be God the Mother. In every religion

21
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,920
except for Christianity, they have openly
talked about this Primordial Mother. Even

22
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:54,590
the Greeks knew about it, the Babylonians
knew about it, I was surprised that even in

23
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:02,450
South America there was a big, very big awakening
about it and they used to worship the Mother

24
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:16,810
God, but somehow in Christianity, I think
it was Paul, who was a Roman to begin with

25
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:35,770
and a tyrannical officer who even killed a
disciple of Christ, Stephan, he is the one

26
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,520
who changed the complete picture of Christianity.
He never knew Christ, he was epileptic and

27
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:00,080
a very hot tempered man, and even he fought
with Mathew because he could not accept the

28
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:09,280
immaculate conception of Christ. A person
who is not even realized, who has led such

29
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,280
a tyrannical life, why did he come to Christianity?

30
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:25,300
He came to Christianity because he thought
it was a very good platform for him to jump

31
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:32,300
onto. I face that in Sahaja Yoga also. There
are people in Sahaja Yoga who come and they

32
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:40,760
just sometimes think that there’s such a
big cruelly affair they can handle, so they

33
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:51,330
try to rule and they try to take to power.
They do not even feel the vibrations, they

34
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:03,750
don’t even feel the all-pervading power,
but they think it’s a good platform to occupy.

35
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:13,190
And this Mr. Paul was again born, was again
born as Augustine and he did even much worse

36
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:21,970
for Christianity.

37
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,240
My father was a very learned man, I asked
him. I said, ”Who is this Paul and how is

38
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,240
it there?” So he told Me, “I don’t understand,
he is a stranger.” and then I asked why

39
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:46,180
Martin Luther, of all the things, did not
describe the Mother? He said it was true that

40
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:55,300
Martin Luther was a realized soul and he wanted
to deviate from Catholicism, but he thought,

41
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,560
at that time, to talk about the Mother would
not appeal to many people who where Islamic.

42
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:11,460
So to convert them to Christianity would be
difficult. It was a little [EXPERIENCE OR

43
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:18,460
EXPERIMENT OR EXPERIMENCY, SOMETHING ALIKE],
I think, they did not refer to the Mother,

44
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:28,390
so they called it the “Holy Ghost”. It
was a funny thing to call, I tell you, really,

45
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:36,190
and then to call it a “dove”. That’s
also, I can’t understand, a symbol, all

46
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:45,400
the time you find a dove everywhere, but in
so many paintings I have seen people putting

47
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:53,970
their hands like this, who are the disciples
of Christ, and I see the light coming out

48
00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:01,430
of their heads. We have photographs, many
miraculous photographs, but of Sahaja Yogis,

49
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:09,760
all of them are sitting like you, and on their
head there is light, but all these things

50
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:22,070
took such a form, such an organization.

51
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Even a person like Khalil Gibran has talked
in complete chapter about Paul, denouncing

52
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:37,340
him completely. Nobody took heat of it, he
was an organizer and a power-oriented gentleman

53
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,430
wanted to have a big power and his place in
the Bible. How did he come in the Bible? I

54
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:51,430
mean, he has nothing to do with the Bible.
And even in the churches they read what he

55
00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:00,240
has said, an epileptic fellow. You will find
out in Sahaja Yoga that epilepsy is caused

56
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:10,460
by possession and if the possession is removed,
you can cure epilepsy. In Russia, we have

57
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:17,500
been able to cure epilepsy of so many people.
Of course, medicine doesn’t have this cure.

58
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:27,740
I Myself studied medicine and I know the limitations
of medicine, it deals just with the outdoor

59
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:35,550
systems of human beings. Is like a tree, which
is sick, so you try to look after the leaves

60
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,160
and give medicines to the leaves, how can
you cure the tree? You have to go to the roots,

61
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,840
and to go to the roots you have to become
a subtler personality. If you can reach the

62
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:56,840
roots, then the whole tree can be nourished.
Now this is the knowledge of the roots, while

63
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:05,570
what we see outside is the knowledge of the
tree. If the tree grows much more into proportion

64
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,230
to the root, then you know what can happen,
and that’s what today we are afraid of,

65
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:22,029
that we might be completely destroyed. We
are on the brink of some sort of a horrible

66
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:27,380
shock that’s going to come to us. It seems
there is a tremendous fear in the minds of

67
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:34,380
people there. Apart from the simple nature
of Americans they are also very much frightened

68
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:48,080
and whatever comes in their way they grow,
they try to get hold of it. This is another

69
00:11:53,810 --> 00:12:00,810
problem you are facing, there is nothing to
be afraid of; this world is not going to be

70
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:08,150
destroyed. The Creator, who has created you,
is the Father of all the Fathers and kindest

71
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,760
of all the kindest. He cannot allow His creation
to be destroyed, so don’t believe these

72
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:26,900
moneymakers who are telling you that this
world is going to be destroyed. That problem

73
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:35,589
of war is over now, thanks to Gorbachev. The
other ecological problems also can be solved

74
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,760
if you people get your Realization, it’s
a very simple thing to solve the problem.

75
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:52,400
But if you start getting at everything without
thinking, without discrimination, then definitely,

76
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:06,350
definitely, America could be destroyed and
if there is any country that will be destroyed,

77
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,250
first will be America, not from without, from
within. That’s why I am so concerned, so

78
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:19,250
concerned, that you should take some heat,
must pay some attention to this aspect what

79
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:27,610
is missing in us? Think of your children and
think of the progeny, and think of your country!

80
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:37,650
Where are we going? And then you’ll realize
you have failed in one point, that you have

81
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:46,120
not turned to your roots, not tried to find
out what your roots are. It’s useless to

82
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,589
say that this country is only two hundred
year old. Country may be two hundred year

83
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:57,589
old, but you are not. You are antics, I would
say, you are born so many times before, in

84
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,440
so many countries and you have been seekers,
you are seekers and seekers, in ages you have

85
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:11,080
been growing in that seeking, and today you
are here to seek, but only thing what you

86
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:17,480
have lost in this seeking is the discrimination
and that’s why I say whatever one may say,

87
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,190
even if I say something, you need not believe,
please don’t! Blind faith is not going to

88
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:30,190
help you to get your Realization, neither
you’re denying it. You have to have an open

89
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:37,750
mind; as I told you, like a scientist, you
must see this hypothesis, if it [SOUNDS LIKE:

90
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:45,860
is there], if it works, then, please, as honest
people you must accept it. There is no secret

91
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:54,190
in Sahaja Yoga, no secret. My life is not
a secret; nothing is a secret, everybody knows

92
00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:00,630
what’s happening in Sahaja Yoga.

93
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:07,630
So, first of all, I have to tell you that
you keep your minds open when I have to tell

94
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:16,890
you about this machinery that is within us
created because of our evolution. As you see

95
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:26,660
there, there are seven centers, which are
placed in the central line, and there are

96
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:34,160
two lines on both the sides, left and right.
Out of these, the first center is below the

97
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:47,920
Kundalini, which is in the triangular bone
known as “sacrum”. “Sacrum” means

98
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:55,370
“secret” and Greek people, Greek museum
people told Me that Greeks considered this

99
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:03,100
bone as a sacred bone. So in this resides
this power, which we call as “Kundalini”

100
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:16,420
in Sanskrit language. Now, this Kundalini
is coiled and the coil is called as “kundal”,

101
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:30,180
that’s why is called as “Kundalini”.
Now, it’s a female, is the power which is

102
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:38,709
female and is the reflection of the Primordial
Mother in you, in Sanskrit called as “Adi

103
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:46,690
Shakti”. Of course, Indian knew about it
thousands of years back, no doubt, no doubt.

104
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:53,350
Fourteen thousand years back, they say. I
don’t know if the English would accept that

105
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,240
we were that old, [SOUNDS LIKE - or not],
but it is said so, people have written about

106
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,250
it.

107
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:07,250
This power rises, six centers it penetrates,
and the seventh one is at the base of it.

108
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:21,589
Now, the seventh one looks after your excretion
or if you are doctors you will understand

109
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:32,439
it also looks after the pelvic plexus. So,
also the sex is looked after by this. So it

110
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:40,889
is clear-cut that in your ascent sex plays
no part. That’s why Christ has said that

111
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,960
you have to be like small children to ascent.
Actually, when Kundalini rises, your attention

112
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:57,330
is no more on sex, all you excretionary functions
stop completely. So now, here, Mr. Freud,

113
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:11,340
or later on you can say Rasputin; or then
Rajneesh, all those who talked of sex being

114
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:21,649
the power of Kundalini, are absolutely wrong.
And then how is it [then OR that?] Christ

115
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:30,619
has said, he corrected the Ten Commandments,
out of that he said, “Thou shall not have

116
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:40,830
adulterous eyes!” Eyes, such a subtle point
is it. Why he said that? In America now, when

117
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:52,360
I come here, I mean, I see everybody has eyes
like this all the time, I mean, they don’t

118
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:59,360
have steady eyes at all. They are Christians,
followers of Christ, and sometimes surprises;

119
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:08,369
in the beginning, you see, one gets a cultural
shock to see what is this, [SOUNDS LIKE: what

120
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:14,690
are you looking at], what are they looking
at? It’s a joyless pursuit, everyone knows,

121
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:21,690
but the eyes have become like that because
they have lost their innocence. But for your

122
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:29,269
information, innocence is never lost, never
lost, only [SOUNDS LIKE: it gets conditioned]

123
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:36,210
or clouded, that’s all, but it is never
lost. I have seen now in My work that everyone,

124
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:43,210
whether they were English, or they were Greeks,
or they were Americans, anybody who gets their

125
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:50,489
awakening gets a steady eye and a innocent
eye. And these eyes could be so powerful that

126
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:59,259
even attention of these eyes or even a glance
of these eyes can transform, can comfort,

127
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,440
can redeem and that’s why Christ has said
it, but actually the Deity of innocence resides

128
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:21,899
there at the seventh center, he incarnates
as Christ at the sixth center here between

129
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:31,989
the optic chiasm, which is giving energy to
our eyes. The essence of Bible can only be

130
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:49,730
understood if you are a realized soul and
you can read between the lines. Though I must

131
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:56,710
say that this Mr. Paul has tried to destroy
a lot of it. Whatever he might have tried,

132
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:03,710
there is so many truths still there in the
Bible and we can see them so clearly, we can

133
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:14,929
feel them, we can understand them. I mean,
for example, once you are a realized soul,

134
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:20,879
a Hindu might say, because I was born in a
Christian family, he would say, “Why did

135
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:26,460
you take your birth in Christian family? You
believe in Christ?” I said, “Of course!”

136
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:32,869
So, I’ll just say, “Alright, you asked
a question like this, put hand towards Me

137
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:39,869
and ask a question, call Me Mother. Mother,
is, was Christ the Son of God?” And he gets

138
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:49,169
cool breeze on his hand, tremendous cool breeze
and he is surprised.

139
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:01,919
Then we have the first center, which is, I
told you, is of sex and sex has nothing to

140
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:08,919
do with your ascent. Only the human beings
can get their Realization, not animals. They

141
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:16,119
too have sex, but that does not mean that
sex, there is something wrong, it’s one

142
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:25,989
of the functions of the body, is an important
function, but it has nothing to do with Divine

143
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:32,989
work. As you go to bathroom, you have sex,
that’s all. So much accent of sex is given,

144
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:47,409
I am surprised, despite that you have minus
population, while in India we never talk of

145
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:55,249
sex. I mean, this word “sex”, I could
not pronounce when I came to London first

146
00:22:55,249 --> 00:23:02,249
because we don’t say this word, is regarded
it spoils your tongue. To say “sex” also

147
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:11,149
with your tongue was something impure. But
then I practiced a little bit [LAUGHTER],

148
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:22,659
but I was very bashful while saying that.
So this is, it is not necessary to put such

149
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:33,889
an accent and to have a mental thinking about
it because if you do it mentally too much,

150
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:40,330
then you are definitely, either you go to
one extreme become rapist and thinks like

151
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:44,869
that, and on the other side you might become
impotent, one of the two things will happen.

152
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:49,809
[SOUNDS LIKE – I mean OR while?] in India,
we have seldom heard stories of rape and all

153
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:56,809
that, seldom, and we never think of, I mean,
I am telling not about the westernized Indians

154
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:04,109
but about villagers, where an eighty year
old woman, grandmother, writing love letters

155
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:09,200
to an eighteen year old grandson. I mean,
if you tell somebody, they’ll tell, they’ll

156
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,200
think I am befooling them, it’s impossible!
So whatever were natural barriers are finished

157
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:25,929
by our so-called freedom, which is actually
a abandonment, but after Sahaja Yoga I don’t

158
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:32,649
have to tell you anything. You just become
righteous, you just become righteous, I don’t

159
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:39,649
have to tell you. Like people who take, took
drugs came to Sahaja Yoga and I must say,

160
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:46,799
English are that way, something deep about
them also. Overnight they gave up their drugs,

161
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:53,669
overnight! I didn’t tell them, I never told
them, I never even talked about the drugs,

162
00:24:53,669 --> 00:25:00,369
alcoholism. There is one doctor who was such
an alcoholic, he was out of job, he was [SOUNDS

163
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:07,369
LIKE: undole OR undone], today he is running
seven hospitals in London, overnight. What

164
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:15,580
has happened actually? That, supposing you
are holding on to a snake and it’s darkness,

165
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:23,249
and if I say, “There’s a snake in your
hand”, they say, “No, it’s not, it’s

166
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:30,249
a rope.” How can you argue with a person,
till the snake bites? So you put on the light,

167
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:35,249
with the light you throw it away yourself,
don’t have to tell anything, don’t have

168
00:25:35,249 --> 00:25:42,249
to argue. So the Spirit is enlightened, your
attention is enlightened with the light of

169
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:49,450
the Spirit, and you see what’s wrong, what’s
wrong with you. What are you holding onto,

170
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,769
and you just give it up and you become so
powerful to give up any habit, it’s so easy,

171
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:59,759
so easy for you to give up.

172
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:06,710
Overnight, I have seen people have given up
all their bad habits, which are really destructive,

173
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:13,710
these are all destructive habits. Whether
you like it or not, but they are destructive,

174
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:21,619
let us face it, but you lose your will power
using in those habits. As a result, you cannot

175
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:31,169
give it up, it’s a helpless condition, no
use forcing, no use giving lecturing, no use

176
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:38,169
making a martyrdom out of it, nothing. Just
get your Self, get to your Self and your light

177
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:46,999
of your Self will show you how powerful you
are, how great you are, what is your Glory,

178
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:54,309
what is your identity. And then you are surprised
because you are connected with that Divine

179
00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:01,340
power and the power starts flowing through
you, and you are surprised how your life [is

180
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:07,600
OR has?] changed and how you have become a
medium for God.

181
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Once, as of course coming to America, I was
coming by ship and our captain told Me that

182
00:27:18,109 --> 00:27:24,279
we are sending a SOS for a person who has
got pneumonia. I said, “I’ll go and cure

183
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:29,700
that person.” But you see, I was the wife
of the owner, so they wouldn’t allow Me

184
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:36,220
to go down. I said, “Alright, you have got
Realization, you’ll just go and touch that

185
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:43,039
man, that’s all.” He went down and put
his hand on his lungs. I told him that, “Ask

186
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:50,039
him to stop his bleeding [twice OR thrice?]”,
his pneumonia was cured, he was so amazed.

187
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:57,200
He came up, he said, “How could I do it?”
I said, ”Because it’s flowing through

188
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:05,229
you.” Even, supposing, an ordinary man gets
the kingdom and is asked to sit on the throne,

189
00:28:05,229 --> 00:28:11,309
he looks this side, that side, whether I should
sit or not, in the same way, though you achieve

190
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:18,309
a position, such a high status, you are a
little frightened to occupy and to accept

191
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:26,479
this position. But I have seen people who
are not realized souls, who do not know anything

192
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:34,099
about Divinity, their lives are full of falsehood,
also they are very bad character people, they

193
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:42,609
become big Gurus, shamelessly, they claim
such big, big things, they have no fear of

194
00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:47,919
God, they have no fear of anything. “So
what, if I have to go tomorrow to jail, doesn’t

195
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:54,919
matter, I’ll have so much money with me!”
But a Sahaja Yogi is very humble, he keeps

196
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:01,460
to himself, he is very contented and he doesn’t
change his outward dress or he doesn’t put

197
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:08,460
on some sort of a funny dress, but he is normal
just like as you are. He doesn’t do anything

198
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:16,580
abnormal. I think, the Sahaja Yogis become
the most normal people, but you'll be surprised,

199
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:22,139
those who have seen them say that, “These
are angels! These are not human beings, these

200
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:26,429
are angels.”

201
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:33,429
So this transformation takes place as this
Kundalini rises on in our centers, so the

202
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:40,479
first center according to real, where the
Kundalini enters, is the second one, which

203
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:47,479
you see as the yellow one. Now, this is the
center, which is responsible for our creativity.

204
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:55,340
I have seen many artists in India who are
extremely anxious to play before Me, and once

205
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:01,820
they have played before Me or twice, they
become world’s famous artists, so many of

206
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:06,639
them will tell you about Me. Now they want
to take My photograph and put it there to

207
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:10,739
show to people that I am their Guru. I said
not to do it, “I am not your Guru I am not

208
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:15,419
talking about music, the only thing is, your
Kundalini has risen, I have nothing to do

209
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:20,840
with it. You had your technique with you,
only thing, because your Kundalini has risen,

210
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,840
you have become so dynamic and you are expressing
yourself without any fear, without any inhibition.”

211
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:34,879
Simple thing as that, but this center be used
too much, specially in the West, when we think

212
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:44,330
too much. And when we think too much, we use
the energy of this center because this center

213
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:54,109
is responsible for converting fat cells into
gray cells for the use of the brain. So, when

214
00:30:54,109 --> 00:31:01,109
you think too much, then it gets entangled
or it gets busy with this only one function,

215
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:09,210
while it has to do many other functions. Like
it has to look after your liver, it has to

216
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:16,210
look after your pancreas, it has to look after
your spleen, it has to look after your intestines,

217
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:25,080
and also your kidneys. So a person who thinks
too much, plans too much, who is futuristic,

218
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:33,549
such a person gets a bad liver and when you
get a bad liver, means an overactive liver,

219
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:39,719
the function of liver is to absorb the heat,
which is a poison within us, and to release

220
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:46,719
it to, into the blood stream, becomes impossible.
So, the heat starts rising, your lungs collapse

221
00:31:50,729 --> 00:31:57,729
with the heat, you get asthma. If it rises
higher, you might get a massive heart attack,

222
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:06,450
it goes lower down, then you get constipation,
it can coagulate your kidneys, you get your

223
00:32:08,129 --> 00:32:13,259
kidneys troubled, you cannot pass urine. Only
one liver can bring all these problems to

224
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:20,259
you. Now the second thing that is affected
by over-thinking is your pancreas, by which

225
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:27,450
you get diabetes. Now in India, in the village
if you go, even in Nepal, they take sugar

226
00:32:29,729 --> 00:32:35,499
as much that the spoon must stand at right
angle, so much sugar they must take. They

227
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:42,499
never get diabetes, never, never, they don’t
know what diabetes is, because they work the

228
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:48,519
whole day, and in the night they sleep [on
OR off?], again next day they get up, work

229
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:55,519
the whole day, they don’t think. Same with
their wives, they also don’t think because

230
00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:01,479
same way they work in the daytime and sleep
in the night. But too much [SOUNDS LIKE prayer

231
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:05,749
OR freer OR payer?] time when we have, we
start thinking, they do not future plan so

232
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:12,379
much, whatever comes their way, they’ll
arrange it, organize it and live with it.

233
00:33:12,379 --> 00:33:18,899
So this diabetes is a special disease of the
people who are planners, who are futuristic,

234
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:25,899
who think too much and who worry too much,
and it’s a vicious circle. Once you get

235
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:33,940
diabetes, you worry too much, so you get more
diabetes.

236
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:39,809
Then comes the third disease, which is much
more dangerous and very common in America,

237
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:45,179
comes from the spleen. Spleen also is to be
looked after by the same center, which we

238
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:52,179
call as Swadisthan. Now the spleen part, the
role of spleen in our body is very important

239
00:33:56,899 --> 00:34:03,899
because it keeps our rhythm, it’s for the
rhythm of the body, rhythm with the nature.

240
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:13,840
Now our life is so hectic. Now, it has to
produce red blood corpuscles according to

241
00:34:14,539 --> 00:34:21,539
certain rhythm, but we have no rhythm. Any
emergency that comes in, it has to produce

242
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:28,440
red blood corpuscles, but since early in the
morning we read the newspaper, this is the

243
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,460
worst curse, I think, for spleen, so you get
a shock, so many killed, I mean, they will

244
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:40,359
never give a good news, never, out of question
because they have to give sensations to you,

245
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:47,359
see, shocks, so they’ll give horrible news
by which your spleen will start pulsating,

246
00:34:48,529 --> 00:34:53,889
giving you more [SOUNDS LIKE arbises OR abases
OR diseases?], then you get in your car without

247
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:58,210
taking your breakfast, the breakfast is in
your hand, you are eating something driving

248
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:05,210
because you are getting late, we are time-bound.
On the way we find all the road jammed, then

249
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:11,270
we get again upset, how are we to reach? Then
we go to the office, we are slightly late,

250
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:16,849
then the boss is shouting at you and you are
in a mess. All these things build up a tension,

251
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:21,390
as we call it, but is nothing but ordinary
[SOUNDS LIKE unrhythmic OR unarrhythmic?]

252
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,630
hectic life of our [SOUNDS LIKE tied cuses
????].

253
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:29,890
Actually, the life should be such that you
start your office at eleven o’clock, better

254
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:36,890
is [LAUGHTER], and you sit down with your
wife, have your food in a rhythmic way, and

255
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:44,460
in the daytime you must have siesta. If Americans
have their siesta in the daytime, all their

256
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:50,849
tensions will disappear, because in the daytime
all the Deities sleep, all the Deities who

257
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:57,020
are on these centers they sleep. So if you
can have a siesta even for half an hour, I

258
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:02,680
tell you, your tensions will disappear. On
the contrary, the pressure amounts on with

259
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,650
the work, this is to be done, that is to be
done, rush, I mean, the Americans never used

260
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:12,400
to speak so fast, I tell you. Nowadays you
can’t follow any news, you can’t follow

261
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,529
what they speak, I mean, it’s impossible
because the words go like telescope [SOUNDS

262
00:36:17,529 --> 00:36:24,200
LIKE: into one each other OR go run each other?].
And the whole life is so made that you feel

263
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:31,130
that they are all under some sort of a earthquake
shock or something. Everybody is running helter-skelter,

264
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:37,130
this, that, you go to a shop, you go, really,
if you see, everybody is having a rat race,

265
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:43,700
on the road, anywhere, this is the curse of
the modern times, but also the blessing of

266
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:50,700
modern times is Sahaja Yoga. That’s why
there is because all these problems have come

267
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:58,359
up, that is why now we have this blessing
of Sahaja Yoga also. So what happens that

268
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:06,920
when we, poor spleen becomes arrhythmic and
crazy, then any shock from the left side can

269
00:37:15,289 --> 00:37:22,289
manifest a very serious disease called as
blood cancer. Now, this blood cancer has been

270
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:31,450
definitely cured by your Kundalini awakening.
I don’t cure because if I say that, all

271
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:38,450
the government will arrest Me, so I would
say, “Your Kundalini cures this blood cancer,

272
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:48,170
and there are many who have been cured of
blood cancer.”

273
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Then the third problem is of high blood pressure,
comes from the kidney. The kidney also coagulates,

274
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:00,599
to begin with it is in such a small dimension
that you don’t feel it, but because of that

275
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:07,599
the pressure rises, then it stops functioning
because it coagulates. This also is absolutely

276
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:18,680
curable through the awakening of your Kundalini.
Then the last is the constipation. I mean,

277
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:28,910
I have seen in Switzerland people eat something
that we give it to buffalos in India, I mean,

278
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:37,460
we cannot think of eating that. I was shocked,
I said, “How can you eat these cotton seeds?”

279
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:42,250
He said, “That’s very good for roughage”,
but I said, “What this roughage? Tomorrow

280
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:48,109
you’ll start eating wood or what? Why do
you need so much roughage?” “Because of

281
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:55,010
this problem.”
So nothing seems to be normal for people who

282
00:38:55,010 --> 00:39:01,930
think too much, and the other side is where
they don’t think at all, absolutely lethargic

283
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:06,990
organs also. So there a two types of human
beings, one on the right side, one on the

284
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:12,270
left side. Those who are sitting and crying
and weeping about their past, “I had a very

285
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:17,200
nice time and now it’s horrid; I had very
good parents and now a horrid husband!”,

286
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,099
sort of things goes on and on and on. At that
time, they become left sided. So we have two

287
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:28,990
types of people, one who are thinking of the
future and those who are thinking of the past.

288
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:35,990
Both the sides are nourished or looked after
by what we call the left and right sympathetic

289
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:43,240
nervous system. The left looks after the left
side and the right looks after the right side.

290
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:50,240
But if we somehow or other get into the center,
then we do not suffer from anyone of these

291
00:39:56,289 --> 00:40:02,210
troubles. Our attention is, say, like a sari,
I’ll show you, like this it moves up and

292
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:07,220
it pulls all our attention in the center through
the Kundalini, till it pierces through the

293
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:14,220
seventh center, and then we are in the center.
Once we come in the center, we are absolutely

294
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:22,710
there, we are in moderation. We know how far
to go with everything and we lead a very peaceful,

295
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:32,099
nice life. We accept the life with great joy
as it is. We don’t hanker, we have no greed

296
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:41,910
left, there is no lust left, but we enjoy
the sex life we have, in the same way we enjoy

297
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:50,119
all the [SOUNDS LIKE: material?] things in
the best way possible. For example, now see,

298
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:57,119
this is the carpet laying down here. When
I watch this, it’s so beautiful. But when

299
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,250
I watch this and start thinking about it,
“Now, how much it must have cost?” Of

300
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,319
course, if it belongs to Me, then it’s a
headache because already I will start seeing

301
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:12,319
if there are any spots, whether it is insured
or not, and if somebody has spoiled it? But

302
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,809
supposing it doesn’t belong to Me, thank
God if that’s so, then also I’ll think,

303
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:20,430
“How much it must have cost?”, I might
feel jealous, so “I should have one like

304
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:25,750
this, I don't have. From what shop the lady
must have bought it? I must go there and get

305
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,019
it.”

306
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:31,289
All these thoughts will be coming into My
head, not the beauty of the carpet, but when

307
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:38,289
this Kundalini rises and crosses over this
center of Christ, then your thoughts become

308
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:46,029
quiet, you become a personality, which we
call as in the stage of “thoughtless awareness”,

309
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:55,670
where you are aware, but no thought. Because
we think of the future, we think of the past,

310
00:41:56,809 --> 00:42:03,809
but we cannot be in the present, but in thoughtless
awareness we are in present, there is no thought.

311
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:10,930
And then the whole thing, that is, the beauty
that was created by the Creator, the joy that

312
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:18,170
was putting to it, starts pouring on to you,
and you start enjoying, just enjoying, not

313
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:25,170
thinking about it. Just seeing, not saying
anything, no reaction, just watching, and

314
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:34,150
the whole of it just pours down. So this is
the state when it comes to your thinking,

315
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:43,829
becomes limited and then your Swadisthana
Chakra gets settled down, it gets also nourished

316
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:52,869
by Kundalini and that is how most of your
problems are solved because every center,

317
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:59,869
when it goes out of order, it creates the
so-called human problems, but Kundalini-rising

318
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:07,769
means it integrates all of them. Once you
are a realized soul, your mind won’t argue

319
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:17,720
with your heart, with your liver, your brain,
but in a very integrated manner you will enjoy

320
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:28,740
everything. You become a witness to a drama.
Like there’s drama going on, you watch the

321
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:35,500
drama and you are involved into it, but once
the drama is over, then you say, “Oh, I

322
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:40,369
am here, I am just a spectator, I am not in
the drama.” In the same way, the whole thing

323
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:47,369
becomes like a drama and you are away from
it. Your problems are like waves, they rise

324
00:43:48,029 --> 00:43:54,230
and fall, but once you are in the boat, you
can see them clearly and you can solve them,

325
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:59,529
but in case you know how to swim, you can
jump in and safe others from drowning.

326
00:43:59,529 --> 00:44:04,519
This is the third stage where you have to
rise, in that stage we call it as the “doubtless

327
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:10,440
awareness”, is called as “Nirvikalpa Samadhi”.
They talk of Yoga, this thing, Hatha Yoga

328
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,010
and all that. What is Hatha Yoga? [SANSKRIT
WORD: Asthanga? YOGA], as there are eight

329
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:18,980
[UNAUDIBLE, SOUNDS LIKE: fold?] things out
of which, these exercises, is just a wee wee

330
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:24,130
wee wee wee weet ..and that, too, is to be
applied only when the Kundalini rises, when

331
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:29,539
there is a problem, but here the way we take
this Hatha Yoga is something like a medicine

332
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:36,539
box. The whole of that without paying any
attention to our Spirit, is for the spiritual

333
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:44,349
growth, not for physical, because if you see
the book of Patanjali, which is so big as

334
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:49,539
that, there he has discussed only what I am
telling you today, and not these things that

335
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:56,539
you stand on your head or you walk like this
or you jog like that. These things come up

336
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:02,869
as a [SOUNDS LIKE: craves?] and we are very
vulnerable to all these things, but if you

337
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:08,049
just look back, you will see, this is all
entrepreneurs staff, they are just trying

338
00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:15,049
to befool us. Not only the Gurus, but also
the entrepreneurs, they are trying to befool

339
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:20,230
us, they tell us, “Now, you must jog because
then you must have jogging suits, you must

340
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:25,500
have jogging shoes, you must have jogging
this and jogging that, and you pay for it.”

341
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:31,359
All the time they are suggesting, “This
is the fashion now!” Start a fashion with

342
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:37,200
the tight pants, now, then they develop very
[SOUNDS LIKE: close] pants, now then, loose

343
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:44,200
pants. It’s just a way of befooling simple
good people, taking advantage of them, and

344
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:52,869
we are slaves. But all these things finish
off once you get your Realization, you understand

345
00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:57,880
these things very well, and you know all these
crooks, and you don’t play into their hands.

346
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:04,880
There is no need, there is no need to go on
wasting your energy in changing your form,

347
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:13,069
dresses, changing everything morning till
evening, making a heap of plastic, which cannot

348
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:19,510
be burned, which cannot be done. You become
really sensible, wise, righteous, beautiful,

349
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:26,510
dynamic, compassionate people in the real
sense of the word and your priorities becomes

350
00:46:30,529 --> 00:46:37,529
so sensible that you are amazed of yourself,
“How have I become like this?”

351
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:46,880
Then we have artists, we have painters, we
have all kinds of people in Sahaja Yoga who

352
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:55,710
have really prospered in their own profession,
doctors have prospered in their own profession,

353
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:03,430
but they are extremely humble, compassionate,
sensible, and they are spirit-oriented, not

354
00:47:04,529 --> 00:47:09,440
money-oriented. And then the money flows,
you don’t have to worry about money. Once

355
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,900
you are spirit-oriented, money is at your
feet, knowledge is at your feet, everything

356
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:21,900
at your feet, because you are blessed. We
have lost the faith in the blessings of God

357
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:30,710
because we are away from Him, but in His Kingdom,
you’ll be surprised how it works, it’s

358
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:40,940
miraculous, is miraculous, every small little
need is looked after and at every small point,

359
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:50,990
you see, the hand of the Devine trying to
help you. That you see yourself. I told them

360
00:47:55,710 --> 00:48:02,359
that they better write about the miracles
of Sahaja Yoga. When they wrote it, it’s

361
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:09,359
so big as that, a pile. I said, “Forget
it, how are we going to publish this?” And

362
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:17,740
that is what just going to happen, that’s
what you deserve. After all, you are human

363
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,190
beings. Those people who tell you, “You
are sinners!” and all that, please know

364
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:33,190
that they must be the greatest sinners ever
born, don’t believe all that, you are human

365
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:40,630
beings after all. Only human beings can make
mistakes, you are not Gods. So if you have

366
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:48,529
made some mistakes, why do they want you to
feel guilty? If you feel guilty, you spoil

367
00:48:48,529 --> 00:48:55,210
this center here, and you get horrible problems
of angina or you might get also spondylitis,

368
00:48:55,210 --> 00:49:00,720
so many troubles with this guilt business.

369
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:07,720
So, please remember that you are a human being
and you have every right to be united with

370
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:13,109
the Divine power, and that’s what Sahaja
Yoga is. “Saha” means “with”, “ja”

371
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:18,980
is “born with you”, is the right to this
“Yoga”, means the “union with the Devine”.

372
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:24,599
Yoga doesn’t mean standing on your heads,
it doesn’t mean anything. If any person

373
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:31,599
who talks of Yoga and doesn’t give you Realization,
don’t go near that person! Yesterday I told

374
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:38,750
you, first thing, nobody can take money from
you. Of course, for this hall they have paid,

375
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:46,559
the Sahaja Yogis have paid, I must say, but
we were just thinking that last four years

376
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:50,890
they have started paying, otherwise I used
to pay, My husband used to pay for everything.

377
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:54,180
But then they said, “You should not pay
for our salvation, Mother, that’s too much.”

378
00:49:54,180 --> 00:50:01,009
Now they have started paying for it, but not
for your Realization, not to Me, but to this

379
00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:08,009
hall, alright, doesn’t matter. And everything,
the accounts and everything, should be clear-cut,

380
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:16,559
you should see where your money goes, what
it happens, what it works on, who is handling

381
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:23,559
the money? Then you have to see if they give
you Realization or not? Realization means,

382
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:31,349
you must feel the cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost. Realization means that you should have

383
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:38,259
powers to raise the Kundalini of others. Realization
means that you feel the actualization of the

384
00:50:38,259 --> 00:50:42,960
baptism, the cool breeze coming out of your
head, not any priest putting water on your

385
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:49,960
head and say that, “You are now a Christian.”
Unless and until these things happen to you,

386
00:50:53,960 --> 00:51:00,960
don’t accept anyone, even Me. This is what
one has to understand, you have to become

387
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:09,619
something, and the time is there, is being
announced, this time has to come, and the

388
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:16,619
time has come and where are the people? That
I should find those people in Russia, I was

389
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:21,890
really surprised, who never had heard about
God, they never had heard about anything about

390
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:28,890
Spirit, they were not supposed to talk about
it, and there you have thousands, how is it,

391
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:37,900
thousands! This hall, we had a hall like this,
ten times bigger than this, was all completely

392
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:45,359
full and the same amount of people was sitting
outside. They had never known Me, they had

393
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:50,240
never seen My face, nothing, only with the
photographs, they were so sensitive. Also

394
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:57,240
Italians, I must say, Italians have that sensibility,
and Greeks. Why not the Americans? You must

395
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:08,220
research it out, you have such a capacity
to do research, for everything you do research,

396
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:12,529
for your car even you do research, for your
sofa set you do research, and for even shoes,

397
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:19,200
they said, they have researched it and made
it comfortable. [LAUGHTER] Then why not research

398
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:26,200
and find out? At least have that scientific
attitude and try to solve the problems that

399
00:52:30,769 --> 00:52:37,049
you have. You all can do it; I know it’s
very capable to do it. Those who become Sahaja

400
00:52:37,049 --> 00:52:44,049
Yogis, Americans, are great people, but first
of all is impossible to make them stick to

401
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:51,740
one thing. As they change their cars, change
their houses, change their motorcars, they

402
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:57,619
are going on changing their Gurus also, you
see, is like a Guru shopping going on. Actually,

403
00:52:57,619 --> 00:53:04,619
you see, I also belong to another kind of
a society, so-called elite society, and I

404
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:09,890
just keep quiet, I never say a word there
because I am absolutely useless. And what

405
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:13,630
they talk, like this, “Oh, have you been
to this Guru, this saintly, you know? There’s

406
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:19,779
a lady, she comes with a van and she has those
laser beams and things like that, she is very

407
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:24,819
expensive, but very good. Very expensive,
but she can give you a little bargain, if

408
00:53:24,819 --> 00:53:31,819
you bargain with her she might, or somebody
is for sale.” Can you imagine? God does

409
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:44,630
not know money, does He? We sold Christ; did
we pay anything to Christ? At least the Christians

410
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:56,650
should not pay! Now, of course, Hindus never
paid anything to Rama, Krishna, nothing, of

411
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:04,859
course [SOUNDS LIKE: that’s OR it’s just?]
there. But this one test you must put, and

412
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:16,930
then the second one that you have to get something
yourself. You must get something and that

413
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:22,769
is your Self Realization, not craziness that
on the street say “Hare Rama, Hare Krishna,

414
00:54:22,769 --> 00:54:28,470
Hare Hare Rama.” What is this? Anybody can
do it, in India everybody does that. Wearing

415
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:35,470
such dresses, what is so difficult? Also in
the supermarket you get that thing, just put

416
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:42,740
it on your head, it’s ridiculous! If you
ask any sensible man in India to do that,

417
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:49,940
he’d say, “Am I mad, why will I do it?”
Also cut your hair this way or to wear some

418
00:54:52,009 --> 00:54:57,559
nonsensical dress, what is so great about,
what is so great? Anybody can do it. Or some

419
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:03,289
people start jumping and saying all kinds
of things, and they said that, “Now we have

420
00:55:03,289 --> 00:55:10,289
got the language, we are speaking some other
language.” Mad people! I mean, if you are

421
00:55:10,289 --> 00:55:17,289
near God, you have to become a much more sensible,
wise, saint people, isn’t it? You have seen

422
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:23,819
the saints, you have seen Zen people, you
have seen all of them, how sensible they were.

423
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:30,819
Were they mad? All kinds of craziness is associated
with God, I can’t understand that. Now,

424
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:40,140
be wise and discriminating and try to understand,
it is through you people only is going to

425
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:50,400
work out.

426
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:57,400
I had asked you to ask Me some questions.
In these one or two days, I am sorry, I can’t

427
00:55:57,579 --> 00:56:03,900
tell you everything about Sahaja Yoga, but
they will give you books and everything, you

428
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,160
can read them and you’ll understand about
everything, about chakras, and they are quite

429
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:13,309
experts and they all tell you about it. Now
say, there are so many lights here. When you

430
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:18,920
come in, I’ll have to just say, “Alright,
put on that switch!” and all of them will

431
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:24,059
come up. But if I have to tell you all about
the history and everything about electricity,

432
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:28,730
and then where it is stored and how it has
come, you’ll be bored stiff. Best thing

433
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:35,599
is you have the light first and then we’ll
talk about it. So if you are hungry, I have

434
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:42,029
done the cooking, I would say, better have
it, and then we’ll discuss it and talk about

435
00:56:42,029 --> 00:56:47,890
it, and there are thousands and thousands
of My lectures, which you can listen to, and

436
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:51,630
you can know a lot, you can become all experts,
you can all become big Gurus, no doubt about

437
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:58,630
it. [LAUGHTER] You’ll become your own Gurus,
I promise, you will become your own Gurus

438
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:08,599
because you are meant to be that, you don’t
need any Guru, your Spirit is your Guru and

439
00:57:12,869 --> 00:57:19,869
that will guide you. It’s like if you take
a, say, television from America and show it

440
00:57:20,869 --> 00:57:26,690
to the Indians in the village and say that,
“In this box you can see the films coming

441
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:31,109
from all over the world”, they will say,
“What? Telling lies? How can this box give

442
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:37,809
us this?”, but you put to the mains. In
the same way, you are put to the mains and

443
00:57:37,809 --> 00:57:44,809
then you see how fantastic you are, all your
fears, all your problems will just dissolve.

444
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:54,099
But you must penetrate into it, deeper and
deeper. Like we had three or four people whom

445
00:57:54,269 --> 00:57:58,849
I gave Realization, and next day they went
to do all kinds of nonsensical things, and

446
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:05,849
now they have got Aids. What can I do? Four,
five years back I gave them Realization nicely,

447
00:58:08,999 --> 00:58:13,049
they never settled down, they went to some
other Gurus and some places and all that,

448
00:58:13,049 --> 00:58:20,049
and they got Aids now there and now suffering
from Aids. Of course they can be cured, but

449
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:27,269
not in America, how can I cure them? I’ll
be again arrested. This is a problem. So you

450
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:36,710
have to get into it deeply and to understand
it, and to become masters. You don’t have

451
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:39,490
to pay for it, again and again I am saying
[SOUNDS LIKE: so OR it OR it so??], only thing

452
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:44,779
you have to give some time. And we have so
much time otherwise. These watches are with

453
00:58:44,779 --> 00:58:51,779
us because we should save time, but we save
time for wasting. We have to save time for

454
00:58:55,249 --> 00:59:02,249
our ascent, not much, five minutes in the
morning, ten minutes in the evening is sufficient,

455
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:11,140
and every week, once a week, you have to come
to the center, then you will not give up.

456
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:16,160
After some time, the greatest punishment for
[a???] Sahaja Yogi is that you have to go

457
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:22,319
out of Sahaja Yoga, is the greatest punishment.
There is no compulsion in Sahaja Yoga. If

458
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:27,130
you want to go away, you can go away. But
sometimes we have to ask them to get out,

459
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:32,420
some of them have to get out and they feel
very sad about it, but then they correct themselves,

460
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:39,420
purify themselves and again come back. But
the movement in America is the least, much

461
00:59:40,589 --> 00:59:47,569
less than even South America, much, much less.
So I have to request you now in San Diego,

462
00:59:47,569 --> 00:59:54,569
last time also, first time I came to San Diego,
so again I request you all that you, because

463
00:59:55,130 --> 01:00:02,130
you belong to the city of Gods, so you have
to take up the responsibility and…

464
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:10,380
Part 2
Now, of course, I would like to have some

465
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:22,440
questions and if they are written down, it’s
better. Yes, please, give it to him. And after

466
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:30,700
this we’ll have the session of Realization,
it will take only ten minutes.

467
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:39,690
QUESTION: [INAUDIBLE] Shri Mataji, when did
you realize your mission? [SOUNDS LIKE: With

468
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:53,650
which?] masters did you gain your inside,
or was it always there?

469
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:06,519
SHRI MATAJI: Always there, I was born with
it.

470
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:13,519
QUESTION: [INAUDIBLE, SOUNDS LIKE: to reach
an environment?] spending a lot of money,

471
01:01:25,069 --> 01:01:32,069
but nothing seems to work. What is the difference
between Sahaja Yoga and these other practices

472
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:37,480
[INAUDIBLE – MAYBE Rajneesh??], TM and Hatha
Yoga, among other things?

473
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:44,480
SHRI MATAJI: TM is the worst, worst of all!
You see, in TM, I must tell you, I didn’t

474
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:54,940
know well what they were doing in TM, but
the head of the “flying foundation” in

475
01:01:55,259 --> 01:02:02,259
Scotland, in [SOUNDS LIKE: Ranac?], this fellow
was Peter Pears and his wife, she is the granddaughter

476
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:11,789
[SOUNDS LIKE: is one?] duke, her name is Linda.
And somebody came to tell Me about them, that

477
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:21,569
they are suffering from epilepsy and they
are in a very bad shape, so I said, “Alright,

478
01:02:23,329 --> 01:02:28,210
I would like to see them.” I didn’t know
they were doing TM or anything, so they came

479
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:35,210
to Me and I asked them, “Who is your Guru?”
So they said, “We went to TM, and I am teaching

480
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:46,730
TM, I was.” And he told Me such horrible
things about it. He is writing a book now

481
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:55,980
about it, that first of all, he told Me, there
are three mantras they used to give, and you

482
01:02:56,809 --> 01:03:03,809
were told not to tell anybody, see? And these
mantras were so funny that if you had told

483
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:12,849
it to any Indian he would have really laughed,
because they were not even Sanskrit. The first

484
01:03:12,849 --> 01:03:19,849
one was “Inga”. “Inga” means the “bite
of a scorpion”, not in Sanskrit language.

485
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:26,450
Then the second one is a “Binga”, and
a “Binga” means “when a person gets

486
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:33,089
possessed and goes round and round”, he’s
a “Binga”. And the third one is a “Tinga”,

487
01:03:33,089 --> 01:03:37,460
which one is that when you show like this
somebody the tongue, you don’t know what

488
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:44,460
to say, “Tinga”, to show like this. And
everybody was asked to pay three hundred pounds

489
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:54,220
for this so-called Mantra and this fellow,
or the Guru, used to sit on the seventh heaven

490
01:03:56,470 --> 01:04:02,349
somewhere, and the person had to come through
six, seven rooms, and [SOUNDS LIKE: untört?]

491
01:04:02,349 --> 01:04:06,999
the great Guru, [[SOUNDS LIKE: he’s?] only
four feet five inches with the squinty eyes

492
01:04:06,999 --> 01:04:13,999
sitting there, and the Guru would tell this
Mantra in the ears, taking three hundred pounds

493
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:16,710
at the first door.

494
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:21,150
Then there was another six thousand pounds.
They said, “Nothing works out, we are going

495
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:27,289
mad with it, so alright, no no no.” So the
second course. The second course they started,

496
01:04:27,289 --> 01:04:33,940
he told Me, was to go to [SOUNDS LIKE: Sitacus?]
or something like that. In that, they had

497
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:39,269
to go to Switzerland, pay six thousand pounds
each, and in a big hall like this they were

498
01:04:39,269 --> 01:04:46,269
all supposed to sit down and jump on cushions
and jump on some sort of a [SOUNDS LIKE: fo

499
01:04:47,979 --> 01:04:54,979
?]. And they were given for six days the water
that boiled some potatoes, six days, and the

500
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:05,269
seventh day they were given the rind to eat,
and the eighth day they gave them to eat the

501
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:12,940
potatoes because they were supposed to become
very light. And they all broke their bottoms

502
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:19,749
because they had to jump very high on that,
but for what? Because he said, “Then you

503
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:23,130
can fly in the air.“ But I said, “Why
do you want to fly like this, already we have

504
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:30,130
problems of, you see, cars and things, and
if you start flying with them, what will happen?

505
01:05:31,259 --> 01:05:36,059
What is the need? You can fly by aero plane,
why do you want to fly like this?” Such

506
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:43,059
funny ideas! But then I found they had become
recluses, all these people had become recluses,

507
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:50,390
and had become epileptic. Then I called him,
his wife and his deputy director, thank God,

508
01:05:53,140 --> 01:06:00,140
My husband had gone out on some work for about
a month, so they stayed in My house, I cured

509
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:08,710
them. But he became completely bankrupt, his
wife was completely ruined. They got cured,

510
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:15,450
no doubt, then he went to South Africa, now
he is there, he is writing this book. And

511
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:22,299
when they wanted to fight the case, the TM
managed, because it was in Scotland, managed

512
01:06:22,299 --> 01:06:27,910
the magistrate, because they have lots of
money. Here also, I feel, they have told the

513
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:32,190
newspapers not to publish anything about us.

514
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:37,849
Everywhere I go they are there just to stop
My work because, you see, after all, it’s

515
01:06:37,849 --> 01:06:44,109
their earnings are killed by that. But the
last thing now they have started, is Ayurveda.

516
01:06:44,109 --> 01:06:49,890
Ayurveda, you don’t need TM for that, anybody
can do Ayurveda, what is the need, what is

517
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:56,130
the need to have an agency of these people?
But it’s a fact, and they know that I know

518
01:06:56,130 --> 01:07:00,970
all their secrets, so they are very much against
Me, doesn’t matter, all of them are against

519
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:05,549
Me, naturally, but they are not against each
other. Like Christ has said that “the house

520
01:07:05,549 --> 01:07:12,549
of Satan will not speak against itself”,
so this is TM. I am sorry that you’ve been

521
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:22,470
to TM. Of course, despite that, now we know
how to manage even TM, most of it we can manage.

522
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,079
What else, you’ve been to Rajneesh also?
[SOMEBODY FROM THE AUDIENCE ANSWERS, SOUNDS

523
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:31,890
LIKE: I wouldn’t say that, Shri Mataji.]
But one thing is definite that you are all

524
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:38,890
seekers, otherwise you could not go to these
people. So is My duty that you should get

525
01:07:40,009 --> 01:07:47,009
your Realization, I am duty bound, it’s
My privilege because you are seekers. I have

526
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:53,309
to give you Realization. Whatever you might
have done, forget it and forgive them! What

527
01:07:53,309 --> 01:07:53,559
else?

528
01:07:53,509 --> 01:07:56,009
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, this [SOUNDS LIKE:
person OR question says OR said?], “[UNAUDIBLE]

529

and how is Sahaja Yoga against such problems?]

531
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:14,960
SHRI MATAJI: I must say, Aids patients have
been cured with Sahaja Yoga. I must say, it’s

532
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:23,690
a fact, no doubt. What we can do in this country,
I don’t know, I have no idea, because I

533
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:30,690
don’t want to get arrested. But in England
“alternate medicines” are allowed and

534
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:38,300
if people could reach England, we might be
able to help them.

535
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:45,300
QUESTION: This [SOUNDS LIKE: person OR question?]
asks: How does one overcome a lifetime of

536
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:54,090
bad habits and how [SOUNDS LIKE: can it be
renewed on a daily basis of our seeking?]

when the light comes in, you just become so

538
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:05,730
powerful, so confident of yourself that all
bad habits stop on. Of course, just after

539
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:10,280
Realization, say, you get your Realization,
that doesn’t mean you become a great saint.

540
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:17,280
You have to fix yourself properly, in American
language, “you have to fix your Yoga.”

541
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:22,970
Unless and until that is done, still you are
vulnerable, you must fix it up.

QUESTION: This [SOUNDS LIKE: person OR question?]
says: Creative energy has a great power. How

can we utilize [SOUNDS LIKE: their channels

QUESTION: Creative energy. How can we use
this power, how can we [SOUNDS LIKE: channelize

it?]?

548
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:49,770
SHRI MATAJI: You get the state, you become
that. I told you, the Swadisthana, the Swadisthana

549
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:55,480
gets nourished, and you don’t know from
where you get your ideas. Now, here it is

550
01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:02,480
an architect, he should tell his own experience,
what he is doing now, and what he was doing

551
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:09,680
before. The ideas start pouring into you because
they come from this Swadisthana chakra, and

552
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:12,440
the Swadisthana chakra gets nourishment.

553
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:19,440

SHRI MATAJI: Hopeless? [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]
You see, racialism comes from ignorance, complete

557
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:38,710
ignorance. We do not know that God has created
all of us just the same, we smile the same

558
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:43,540
way, laugh the same way, cry the same way.
Nobody tells that the Americans should laugh

559
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:50,540
like this and the Indian should laugh like
that, we yawn the same way, we sleep the same

560
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:57,210
way, wake up the same way. Now, we are differently
made, God has made us to create beauty, you

561
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:00,660
see, if there is [SANSKRIT WORD, SOUNDS LIKE:
VAICHITRA] as they say in Sanskrit, if there

562
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:07,170
is variety, then there is beauty. So variety
is created. God created only one world, He

563
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:12,750
didn’t know that we’ll make so many out
of it, we have done it, but once this ignorance

564
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:19,750
goes away, because Spirit is a universal being,
then you become a universal being. Like yesterday

565
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:28,850
only, I told you that when I went to Russia,
twenty-five Germans rushed to Russia to give

566
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:33,270
Realization to Russians. And the way they
[SOUNDS LIKE: impressed] and the way they

567
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:40,270
loved them, I really, I tell you, I felt so
happy and tears started rolling My eyes, such

568
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:50,760
a joy! Imagine, the Russians, and we have
these Germans who are so gentle, they are

569
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:59,530
the gentlest people, you won’t call them
“Germans” anymore. That's what happens

570
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:06,530
because basically you are that, and you become
a universal being, and you follow the religion,

571
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:13,160
which is innate within you, which makes you
an universal being. You don't become any Christian,

572
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:18,660
Hindu, Muslim, nothing, you are a human being,
and you become a universal human being, and

573
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:25,660
you respect all of them, not one. What is
the next problem here? Joblessness. The joblessness

574
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:39,100
also, I must tell you, that in London, it’s
so many jobless people there are, but is difficult

575
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:46,890
to find a Sahaja Yogi who is a jobless there,
difficult, they just get jobs, and because

576
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,640
they are doing the job of God also.

577
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,590
QUESTION: [UNAUDIBLE] hopelessness, Shri Mataji.

578
01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:59,900
SHRI MATAJI: Hopeless, that is not, it’s
very hopeful.

579
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:06,900
QUESTION: This [SOUNDS LIKE: person OR question?]
asks, Shri Mataji: What has the potential

580
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:14,580
to make [UNAUDIBLE]? Would you still recommend
to give up material wealth to get to reality,

581
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:21,280
or is it better to make the money and give
it to charity, [SOUNDS LIKE: do OR is??] that

582
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,270
helping people?

583
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:26,480
SHRI MATAJI: You see, if you are making lots
of money or [SOUNDS LIKE: others OR either?]

584
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:33,480
making no money, whatsoever. In Sahaja Yoga
you make money, alright, but there you do

585
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:39,190
not cling to it, you do not hanker after it.
Now, there was a lady here in San Francisco.

586
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:45,120
She was running a store, and when she got
Realization, she said that, “I used to meticulously

587
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,990
remember this thing I have got, that I have
got, this is bought, this is sold and all

588
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:56,990
those things, I’ve forgotten all that, but
now I am making a big profit.” I said, “Then

589
01:13:57,370 --> 01:14:04,370
it is alright”. Money also is one of the
blessings of God. As Shri Krishna said, “Yoga

590
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:11,040
[Sanskrit WORD, SOUNDS LIKE: KSHEMA MAHAMYAM?]”,
[SOUNDS LIKE: “Kshema”] means “benevolence

591
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:17,510
in every way”. So, once you get your Yoga,
then you get that, not before. [SOUNDS LIKE:

592
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:23,020
Yoga Kshema?], first Yoga, and then the [Kshema?],
[Kshema?] is the benevolence, so all kinds

593
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:28,910
of benevolence come,you’re your mad race
about money finishes off. But you get money,

594
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:33,400
alright, and there is a complete satisfaction
out of it.

595
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:40,400
QUESTION: The second part of this question
[SOUNDS LIKE: You have just answered, but

596
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:49,380
the first part is: How are you and Sahaja
Yoga supported if nobody is accepted for the

597
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:49,630
practice?]

598
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:50,480
SHRI MATAJI:: Supported? In what way?

599
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,540
QUESTION: Means, if nobody is taking…

600
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:52,730
SHRI MATAJI: Financially?

601
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:53,520
QUESTION: Yes.

602
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,380
SHRI MATAJI: I mean, I told you, now, that
in the beginning, of course, I used to pay

603
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:03,170
for everything, no doubt. Even now in so many
places, for Russia, I have to pay Myself.

604
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:06,210
For the
time being, is alright, My husband is very

605
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:10,860
generous, and he is an Indian, so he thinks
he is doing some God’s work, you see, [SOUNDS

606
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:15,750
LIKE: by OR buy?] that and he will get some
good blessings, so he’s a sensible man.

607
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:22,750
[LAUGHTER] He doesn't mind if I am [UNAUDIBLE
– LIKE: these bank], he doesn’t mind.

608
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:29,640
And also now, you see, all these things like
hall and all that, these people get it, and

609
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:36,520
everything is arranged by them nowadays. But
as I told you, that for Realization you cannot

610
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:42,060
pay, you cannot pay Me, you cannot purchase
Me, you cannot, and you cannot purchase your

611
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:49,060
Self Realization, your ascent. But it’s
not much, you see, for this hall, how much

612
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:57,350
you need? Don't need much money, that's all.
Either you will pay thousands and thousands

613
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:09,020
of rupees and pounds without asking, and if
somebody has to pay even for the hall, they

614
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:12,270
will say, “How do you get this money?”
I mean, of course, for the hall you have to

615
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:16,900
pay, you don't expect Me to pay for it, but
I did. I am saying, I did pay, but now they

616
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:22,690
feel ashamed that I should pay for the hall,
they paid because they are also concerned

617
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:28,220
and you will also pay, I am sure. You would
not like Me to pay for these halls, as well

618
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:35,220
as for everything, for your food, or for everything,
do you expect Me to do that? Not at all. So

619
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:43,520
for your salvation you need not pay, but for
your hall you have to pay, there is no harm,

620
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:48,100
but I don't keep accounts. I don't know how
they paid what they, I have no idea, I don't

621
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:52,580
understand accounts at all, so they do it,
everything, and they have to explain to you.

622
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:56,280
I have nothing to do with [SOUNDS LIKE: them
OR that?]. It's a fact, I am telling you,

623
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,500
if it is wrong they should tell Me.

624
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:04,500
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, this person asks: How
is Self Realization and God Realization [INAUDIBLE]?

625
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:14,350
SHRI MATAJI: It’s again a futuristic question.
First, let us have the Self, as Buddha has

626
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:23,060
said, and also as Mahavira has said, because
they thought if you talk of God Realization,

627
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:29,940
people just start thinking they are God. The
difference between the two things is one,

628
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:36,940
that first you get your Self Realization established,
means you understand your powers as Self,

629
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:43,500
then you try to understand God. And God Realization
is a situation in which you control so many

630
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:50,500
things automatically, automatically you control.
You don't have to bother and just control,

631
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:58,750
and you are amazed how even the elements are
controlled through your presence. But the

632
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:05,800
first is to know your Self, establish your
Self, know it well, master it and then think

633
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,960
of another thing.

634
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,880
Part 3

635
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:19,160
QUESTION: The second question is: What are
the vibrations really and how do I read them

636
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,570
precisely, [SOUNDS LIKE: … without deception?]?

637
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:27,690
SHRI MATAJI: Alright. First, as again I say,
first your Self Realization must be established

638
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:33,290
and your Kundalini must be fixed properly.
And then, [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS TO SOME PEOPLE

639
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:37,630
IN THE HALL: You can sit here, there are seats,
come along!] and then you start feeling the

640
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:43,510
vibrations on your fingertips, first of all.
That you will feel now even. Then, they have

641
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:50,510
marked them to show the centers, see one,
two, three, four, five, on your fingertips,

642
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:57,580
so you will know, which is the center that
is catching. If you know how to correct the

643
01:18:57,580 --> 01:19:01,920
center, then you can correct your center.
In the same way you can feel the centers of

644
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:08,250
others. Once you start feeling them properly,
you have to just know how to correct these

645
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:14,440
centers, finished. Then you’re alright and
it hardly takes one month, hardly takes one

646
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,040
month.

647
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:23,040
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, the next five questions
are all about different Gurus, [UNAUDIBLE]

648
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:28,430
all about different ones.

649
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:29,870
SHRI MATAJI: Which ones?

650
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:34,900
QUESTION: One is about [SOUNDS LIKE: Swami
Ram]. Do you believe in his teachings?

651
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:40,360
SHRI MATAJI: What is the use of teachings?
You have had many, you have had Christ, he

652
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:47,360
has given you the Bible, there is so many
we have had. Now, no more teachings, actualization,

653
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:49,750
ask for actualization! What else?

654
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:54,940
QUESTION: [UNAUDIBLE, SOUNDS LIKE: … Yogananda
and his teachings about Krija Yoga, which

655
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:57,700
he said is the quickest technique for Self
Realization.]

656
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:58,770
SHRI MATAJI: I said?

657
01:19:58,770 --> 01:19:59,560
QUESTION: No, Yogananda.

658
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:06,560
SHRI MATAJI: Oh, he might have said it, but
nobody has got it so far. [LAUGHTER] Now,

659
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:13,260
what is Kriya Yoga? Sahaja Yoga is Akriya,
“Kriya” means [SHRI MATAJI ASKS ASIDE:

660
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:20,260
What you call “Kriya”, in English? – ANSWER:
Action.] “action”, “Kriya” is “action”,

661
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:26,290
and Sahaja Yoga “Akriya”, “no action”.
Now, Kriya Yoga is like this. Yesterday, I

662
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:33,290
explained to some people who asked Me that
when your car starts, I mean, when it is ignited,

663
01:20:35,410 --> 01:20:41,030
then automatically all the machinery starts
working, automatically. You don't have to

664
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:47,460
move anything, it’s all built in, but Kriya
Yoga is this that you don't start the car,

665
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:53,270
you don't start the Kundalini, but you start
moving the wheels. First time when I came,

666
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:56,650
I was very shocked. Now they have stopped
all that nonsense because they think there

667
01:20:56,650 --> 01:21:01,730
was some sort of a [SOUNDS LIKE: … stitcher?]
on that. They used to cut the tongue, this

668
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:06,850
thread of the tongue, and I saw some Indian
doctors with their tongues wagging like that.

669
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:13,070
I said, “What has happened?” They couldn't
speak. So they told Me that, “We have cut

670
01:21:13,070 --> 01:21:20,070
our threads because we have to push back our
tongue and get to the [SOUNDS LIKE: catchery?]

671
01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:26,270
condition.” Now, [SOUNDS LIKE: catchery?]
is a simple thing, which is described, of

672
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:32,410
course, is a part of Sahaja Yoga only, that
when the Kundalini rises, the centers, first

673
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:39,410
of all, allow the Kundalini to rise and then
they augment. Then again they relax, the higher

674
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:47,660
ones, and then they augment because they have
to stop the Kundalini from falling down. [SOUNDS

675
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:52,120
LIKE: Is OR It’s?] simple thing like that.
In the same way, when it reaches Vishuddhi

676
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:59,120
chakra, here also, what happens when Kundalini
rises higher, there is a big augmentation

677
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:03,330
that takes place and the tongue is pulled
inside, which you don't feel normally, you

678
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:08,840
won't feel because the Kundalini rises like
a jet these days. So, what they did [SOUNDS

679
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:13,790
LIKE: was/which/with?] to cut the tongue and
put it there. But the Kundalini is sitting

680
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:20,790
in the sacrum bone only, what’s the use?
So, the whole Kriya Yoga is like moving your

681
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:28,930
wheels, while the car has not started. Is
very easy to talk of these things because

682
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:38,080
in India these books are available, you can
read them. I know of people, there was an

683
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:42,440
actress who came to My program when I came
in 1971. There were so many people who came

684
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:46,890
to My program and also Dr. [SOUNDS LIKE: JODRY?]
told Me that, “You better get it copyright.”

685
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:52,790
I said, “There is no copyright needed for
this kind of a thing, it’s alright.” And

686
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:57,180
they are using My words, they are using the
word Kundalini, there is Maha Yoga, they are

687
01:22:57,180 --> 01:23:03,490
using the words like [SOUNDS LIKE: Self Realization
OR self realizing?], everything, I’m doing

688
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:10,490
nothing about it, just making money. Sorry,
what can I do about it? It is for you to decide.

689
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:19,350
It is the actualization, which you should
ask, and this is what is this Kriya Yoga.

690
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:25,380
I don't know why people are so impressed by
his book. What has he written there? He went

691
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:31,010
to Himalayas, he met one Guru, so what? Anybody
can do that, what is so great? What has he

692
01:23:31,010 --> 01:23:38,010
[SOUNDS LIKE: written?]? Why should it impress
people? What has he done? Nothing. They have,

693
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:43,520
of course, got a big place where they live
and all that, that's all. But I don't think

694
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:49,410
anybody has got Realization from them, they
cannot! First, the Kundalini has to be awakened.

695
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:56,410
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, this question asks:
What is your relation to Babaji?

696
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:03,900
SHRI MATAJI: Who is this? Nothing, I am absolutely
against him, that's all. It’s another hooks.

697
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:10,900
These are all hooks, believe Me, they are
all hooks! Ramana Maharshi was the realized

698
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:20,210
soul, no doubt. Shirdi Sai Nath was a realized
soul. Those who were realized, I’ll say

699
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:26,210
yes, those who are not, I will definitely
say, “They are not.” I have to say that.

700
01:24:26,210 --> 01:24:33,210
This Babaji’s [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] experiences
of these funny people, it’s a long story.

701
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:50,660
This Lahiri Baba, Lahiri, Lahiri Baba, the
Guru of this Yogananda, is his grandson, he

702
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:55,990
came to Me and he said that, “I joined this
Kriya Yoga, I did all kinds of things, and

703
01:24:55,990 --> 01:25:02,120
I never got any Realization or anything, so
I was so fed up. Then I went to this Krishnamurti.

704
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:07,740
I was with him, but then I started speaking
like Krishnamurti, just like his voice and

705
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:12,310
everything, I started speaking, doing all
the drama of Krishnamurti and everything.

706
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:16,870
And then I got a fright, one day I saw myself
in the mirror. I said, ‘Oh God, I am becoming

707
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:21,200
Krishnamurti, and I am just giving lectures,
that’s all.’ So, Mother, I’ve come to

708
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,920
you, [SOUNDS LIKE: so OR now?] please now
give me Realization!” You will be surprised,

709
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:28,680
till today, I’ve not been able to do that!
This one person I have not been able to do

710
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:33,050
that. I don't know what all he has done. I
told him, “What all you have done, you tell

711
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:37,470
Me!” And he was telling Me so many things
about this Lahiri Baba and his Babaji. I said,

712
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:44,470
“Whow, please, all these things they do
to you? Horrible!” So much they have harmed

713
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:53,210
him, this man, he is the grandson of Lahiri
Baba.

714
01:25:53,210 --> 01:26:00,210
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, this question asks:
What do you think of Guru Nanak [SOUNDS LIKE:

715
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:03,010
… and Guru…?]?

716
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:10,010
SHRI MATAJI: Guru Nanak, of course. I mean,
Guru Nanak was the incarnation of the Primordial

717
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:18,180
Master, no doubt about it, no doubt. He talked
of unity, he was the incarnation of the Primordial

718
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:25,420
Master who has incarnated many a times as
Moses, as Abraham, and also he has been Mohammed

719
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:32,920
Sahib, and then Guru Nanak, no doubt about
it.

720
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:37,610
QUESTION: This question asks: Is it possible
that the Russians are open to Self Realization

721
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:42,160
because of the influence of the Matreya there?

722
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:45,520
SHRI MATAJI: Of the?

723
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,740
QUESTION: Matreya.

724
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:52,400
SHRI MATAJI: Maitreya! I don't know about
they know about Maitreya or not, is all a

725
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:57,160
Buddhist idea of Maitreya. How will you recognize
the Maitreya also, how will you recognize

726
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:04,160
the Holy Ghost? If you are still waiting for
Maitreya, then, I think, you are sadly mistaken.

727
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:13,250
QUESTION: This questions asks: Can a person
achieve out-of-body experience through Sahaja

728
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:13,740
Yoga?

729
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:15,460
SHRI MATAJI: What experience?

730
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:16,560
QUESTION: Out-of-body.

731
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:23,560
SHRI MATAJI: No, not at all, that's horrible!
Why do you want to go out of your body? [LAUGHTER]

732
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:34,030
Going out of body is achieved through possession!
You know, there are children killed in the

733
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:40,340
beds, have you heard of such a thing here?
I don't know, but in Switzerland. Children

734
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:46,460
are sleeping in their beds because their parents
don't keep the children with them, and the

735
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:52,790
children, they die. That is what is happening
because of this body business. The spirits,

736
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:59,790
they come out, and if they go out of the body,
then these spirits can take away another spirit

737
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:07,820
also, and never return them. Is the worst
thing, is to become possessed like this. I

738
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:15,610
[SOUNDS LIKE: met OR had?] three American
journalists long time back, they came to see

739
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:22,610
Me. And they told Me that, “Mother, we want
to have a special capacity to know what is

740
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:30,860
happening everywhere and without being there,
how can we do it?” I said, “Who told you

741
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:36,550
that I can do that?” So they told Me a name
of a journalist, another one. I said, “He

742
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:42,740
told you this? I was the one who cured him
of this disease, and he told you these things

743
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:49,740
that I will make you like that?” That fellow
would disappear from his body and would go

744
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:55,360
somewhere else, and hear something else and
used to publish in the newspaper, which was

745
01:28:55,360 --> 01:29:00,750
true, but his wife was so shocked by that,
she brought him, and he said, “Mother, please

746
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:05,380
make me one person, I don't want to have this
nonsensical thing!” She said, “One day,

747
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:12,280
he will be dead.”. I said, ”He will be,
one day, he will be lost.” And these three

748
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:19,150
people wanted to be like him, whom I cured,
to get this disease. It’s a horrible state,

749
01:29:19,150 --> 01:29:24,840
one should never, never, think of that! Why
do they want to run away from the present?

750
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:31,840
Present is the most beautiful thing, is the
most beautiful thing! Present is the reality,

751
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:42,940
the past is finished and future doesn’t
exist, but if you can be in the present, nothing

752
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,940
like it!

753
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:51,810
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, this question asks:
What about vegetarianism.

754
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:58,810
SHRI MATAJI: There are no isms in Sahaja Yoga,
no isms at all. Is in the Bible, is written,

755
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:06,260
all beings are created for you, for your use,
and smaller animals than you. Those people

756
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:12,770
who need protein should eat. Now, for example,
in Greenland, people cannot have any vegetables

757
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:19,770
at all, so are they sinners? But, I would
say, Americans should take more vegetarianism,

758
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:29,780
is good because they have eaten too much of
meats, so give a balance. But there is no

759
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:34,620
at hard and fast food about it except that
you should not eat any animal which is bigger

760
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:41,620
than you, because they have a bigger musculature
cell, and those cells can harm your teethes,

761
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:49,430
can harm your intestines. But smaller animals
are to be, if it is needed, must be eaten.

762
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:57,110
If it is not for Indians must eat meat, otherwise
already they are such useless people, they

763
01:30:57,110 --> 01:31:04,110
are good for nothing, they can’t even hold
a gun, leave alone a revolver. If you people

764
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:11,240
go there with one revolver, the whole village
will jump into the well, such cowards! So

765
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:20,460
for them it is necessary to eat meat, but
they are vegetarians. But not in India, everybody

766
01:31:20,650 --> 01:31:27,650
is not, now, it is better, but what I am saying,
it is a very logical thing and is to be understood,

767
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:36,240
what sort of a person you are? If you are
a left-sided person, then you must take proteins,

768
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:42,520
but if you are a right-sided person then you
must take to vegetables and to carbohydrates.

769
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:49,200
Is question of proteins, carbohydrates, and
fats, is not a question of animals and that.

770
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:56,200
Do you mean by saving chickens I can give
them Realization? [LAUGHTER] And this nonsense

771
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:04,390
of vegetarianism has gone so far, so far now.
Among Chinese, I don't if you know, there

772
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:10,070
are many here, because they are moneymakers.
Chinese, these Chinese have started a funny

773
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:16,130
type of vegetarianism, I think long time back.
First of all there was one [SOUNDS LIKE: Nemi]

774
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:23,130
Nath who was one of their [SOUNDS LIKE: Hankaras?],
who was a cousin of Shri Krishna, who saw

775
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:30,400
many dead things in his marriage. So he felt
that, I mean, he felt, sometimes you do feel

776
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:36,190
that so many animals had died and all that,
we call it [SOUNDS LIKE: Tubarati?]. So he

777
01:32:36,190 --> 01:32:43,190
started vegetarianism. But now the Jains do
not allow any insects to die, even the bugs,

778
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:52,010
the mosquitoes, viruses, anything should not
be dead, but they’ll kill human beings,

779
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:56,620
alright, not animals [LAUGHTER], so ridiculous
it is.

780
01:32:56,620 --> 01:33:03,620
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, this person says that
they have skin cancer and wants to know how

781
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:14,400
they will be cured? This person has skin cancer
and they want to know how they can get rid

782
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:15,570
of it?

783
01:33:15,570 --> 01:33:20,590
SHRI MATAJI: Cancer, skin cancer, it comes
from liver. If your liver is cured, you can

784
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:27,590
be, very easily. We have a liver diet, which
you have to take. You have to get your liver

785
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:32,820
cured, which can be easily cured. Work it
out, have faith! You see, because you don't

786
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:37,740
have to pay, that's why people don't do it.
I have seen it, they don't do it seriously.

787
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:44,740
It’s like this, if you pay for something,
then you get bound, that’s mentality. Like

788
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:50,510
yesterday, as I was telling you that if you
have paid for a play, and the play may the

789
01:33:50,510 --> 01:33:55,350
worst possible, [INAUDIBLE] we have paid for
it, so go through it. But you don't have to

790
01:33:55,350 --> 01:34:02,350
pay in Sahaja Yoga, so people don't take it
seriously. Asthmas have been cured, livers

791
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:07,790
have been cured, cancer, this skin cancer
is no problem at all. But whatever they tell

792
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:11,580
you, you have to listen to them and work it
out. Within one month, you will be find out

793
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:18,580
everything will be cured. There has to be
commitment about it, you must be committed

794
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:25,230
to yourself that “I am going to get alright!”
You decide on that point and it will work

795
01:34:25,230 --> 01:34:32,230
out. “I am going to be a Yogi.” You will
be, but there should be some commitment.

796
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:40,530
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, the last question was:
How we know if we are in our Spirit and following

797
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:56,050
our inner guidance?

798
01:34:56,050 --> 01:35:03,050
SHRI MATAJI: Now his question is: How we are
to know that we are the Spirit? Now, we become

799
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:12,180
the Spirit. First of all, when we become the
Spirit, we start feeling the cool breeze all

800
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:19,980
around us. First thing. Secondly, then we
start feeling our centers on our fingertips.

801
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:25,690
Like, supposing, I get American money and
I have never known what American money is,

802
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:30,540
supposing, then I have to go to the market
to find out what it means. In the same way,

803
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:36,700
you start using your hands, as I told you,
the captain of the ship, and you will feel

804
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:43,650
the vibrations of another person. You ask
that person, now, supposing, you feel here

805
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:49,700
some heat or some sort of burning, you ask
him, “Is something wrong with your throat?”

806
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:56,700
“How do you know?”, he will say. You can
feel the cancer, you can feel everything on

807
01:35:57,990 --> 01:36:04,990
your fingertips, you can diagnose. So, you
have to use your hands, that’s how you will

808
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:12,420
know. But then you start curing yourself,
and you start getting feeling better. Then,

809
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:21,120
when you become the master of this art, you
start curing others. Not only physically,

810
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:28,120
mentally, emotionally, every way, you feel
such a balance, such a joy, and such peace

811
01:36:28,690 --> 01:36:34,550
within yourself. There is not talking about
peace because I know, because I’ve been

812
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:40,320
with such people who have “Foundation of
Peace”, and some people have got Nobel Prize

813
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:46,320
in peace and so hot tempered that you can’t
sit near them for five minutes, they emit

814
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:53,320
horrible heat like a heater! I really tell
you, horrible, and they have got Nobel prizes

815
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:58,360
in peace. I mean, I don't know how people
have given them for peace? At least they could

816
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:05,360
have given them for violence, but not for
peace, but there is. So, you really feel peaceful

817
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:11,030
within yourself. Now, you won’t believe,
I am sixty-seven years of age, and if you

818
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:15,280
see My itinerary, you will [SOUNDS LIKE: fait
OR faint OR faith?] the way I travel, all

819
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:19,130
the year around I’m practically traveling,
[SOUNDS LIKE: but I am quite in peace OR I

820
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:22,060
am fine?] with Myself. They say, “How do
you manage”? I said, “Why? I am there,

821
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:28,910
when I am traveling, I know I am there. So,
what is there to be thinking about, just I

822
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:32,440
am there, that's all.” “So, but you think
you are traveling?” I say, “I don’t

823
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:38,070
that way. I am just sitting there, I am not
traveling, it’s the aero plane that’s

824
01:37:38,070 --> 01:37:43,730
traveling.” And that’s how, you just,
you are at peace with yourself, you are with

825
01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:50,730
peace with everybody else and, I mean, it’s
another personality that evolves out of you.

826
01:37:54,600 --> 01:38:01,600
So, that’s how you know you are that. I
mean, first of all, people don't even believe

827
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:09,320
that the cool breeze is coming to your fingertips,
is really, they think, there must be the window,

828
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:14,560
there must be an air conditioner. Some people
go home, close all the doors and start seeing.

829
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:21,560
It’s true, but then they realize.
So you have to spend it and experiment with

830
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:27,460
it, and then you definitely start believing
in it that you are the Spirit, and then you

831
01:38:27,460 --> 01:38:34,460
understand your powers. Alright, you can raise
the Kundalini of a person, you can, and you

832
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:43,960
will be amazed that how you can do it! In
the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, we had about

833
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:49,000
twelve people and they would not put their
hands. They said, “No, how can we do, we

834
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,530
don't have anything, they were very diffident
about it?” So, one day, there was a lecture

835
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:59,540
arranged in a place where I had to go in [SOUNDS
LIKE: Nashik?] and I had to go by car. And

836
01:38:59,540 --> 01:39:03,990
luckily, the car failed and in India, if your
car fails, you are stranded, there is nothing

837
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:09,620
else that you can do. And these people thought
that one hour has passed, Mother has not come

838
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:13,730
and all these people are now going to beat
us. So they started giving them Realization,

839
01:39:13,730 --> 01:39:20,730
and they were amazed, they had the power.
They had the power, and that’s how they

840
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:27,940
discovered. So you have to be bold about it.
You are that, I assure you! Only thing, you

841
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:32,410
must claim what you are.

842
01:39:32,410 --> 01:39:37,760
I think, we are finished with the things now,
let’s have our Realization!

843
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,910
Part 4
That will take about ten minutes and will

844
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:48,910
be a good idea to know your self. If you want
to be out for about five minutes, you can

845
01:39:57,780 --> 01:40:02,080
go out. Then we can start it, if you think
that we can give five minutes to you, just

846
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:09,080
to move out a little bit – and then come
back.

847
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:30,300
Part 5
Before we start, at the outset, I would like

848
01:41:53,530 --> 01:42:00,530
to tell you that there are two conditions
we have to fulfill. The first condition is,

849
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:10,240
you have not to feel guilty at all, at all!
That means, you have to completely forget

850
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:22,420
the past and forgive yourself. These are only
mental conceptions, why do you judge yourself?

851
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:33,550
Your Kundalini will judge you, so please,
just say that, “I’m not guilty at all.”

852
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:47,630
Don't try to remember each and everything
that has made you feel guilty, but just in

853
01:42:47,630 --> 01:42:54,630
general, “I am not guilty at all. I have
not done anything wrong, whatsoever, I am

854
01:42:57,850 --> 01:43:04,850
a human being and I have a right to become
a Yogi, I have every right.” Alright.

855
01:43:08,570 --> 01:43:15,570
And the second one is that you have to forgive
everyone, in general again. Some will say,

856
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:26,840
“It’s difficult to forgive”, but whether
you forgive or you don't forgive, what do

857
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:33,780
we do? Logically we don't do anything, but
when we don't forgive, then you play into

858
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:40,530
wrong hands. The people who have tortured
you, have troubled you or made you unhappy,

859
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:47,530
when you do not forgive them, they are very
happy, but you become miserable. So, in general,

860
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:56,780
you forgive everyone, in general. Again, you
don't have to think, but who are the people

861
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:04,440
who have troubled you, but in general you
forgive everyone. This is a very important

862
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:12,180
part of Sahaja Yoga because the center which
is the optic chiasm, as I said, the gate,

863
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:21,160
is very constricted, and unless and [MISSING:
until??] you forgive everyone, I tell you,

864
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:30,680
this center won’t open out. And you don't
want to miss out your Self-Realization for

865
01:44:31,170 --> 01:44:36,220
these nonsensical people, those who have tortured
you all your life, and now also they are standing

866
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:43,220
in the way. So, just forgive them, all of
them, together, these are the two conditions

867
01:44:48,450 --> 01:44:55,450
we have to fulfill. First, is not to feel
guilty at all, and second is to forgive everyone

868
01:44:56,530 --> 01:45:03,530
in general. Just to say, I forgive everyone,
finished, nothing to do, just finished. Now,

869
01:45:11,410 --> 01:45:18,410
we have to use the Mother Earth and we have
to use our left hand and right hand, the left

870
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:28,800
hand is the one, which is the power of desire,
while Kundalini is the power of pure desire.

871
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:37,940
The left hand is the power of desire, and
the right hand is the power of action. Now,

872
01:45:38,010 --> 01:45:43,240
here we don't do much action, but we can nourish
our centers, and also by this you will know

873
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:50,240
how to later on raise your Kundalini again
and again. So, in this program, we can combine

874
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:58,280
both things together in a very simple manner,
[SOUNDS LIKE: it’s OR is??] extremely simple.

875
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:04,490
So first of all, we’ll have to take out
our shoes to take help from the Mother Earth,

876
01:46:04,490 --> 01:46:11,490
you can keep your socks, but shoes should
better [SOUNDS LIKE: get out??].

877
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Now, to put your left-hand towards Me, can
put it on your lap, if you want to. This is

878
01:46:30,850 --> 01:46:37,850
symbolic that you have the desire, just symbolic
that you have a desire to get your Self-Realization.

879
01:46:40,530 --> 01:46:47,530
So please, put your left-hand on your lap
all the time, constantly, and now we have

880
01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:56,410
to use the right hand to nourish our centers.
So first, I’ll show you [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS

881
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:05,760
TO A YOGI: Dave?, will you come up, please!],
he will show you how to put your hands, this

882
01:47:07,490 --> 01:47:14,490
is all to been seen first of all, and later
on you have to close your eyes, and then we’ll

883
01:47:14,870 --> 01:47:21,870
work it out. First, you have to put your hand
on your heart, on your heart because in the

884
01:47:22,220 --> 01:47:29,220
heart resides the Spirit. Now, if you are
the Spirit, you are also your Master, and

885
01:47:34,010 --> 01:47:41,010
this power of Mastery is within you, and the
center of Master is on the left-hand side

886
01:47:41,890 --> 01:47:48,890
of your stomach in the upper part or you can
call the abdomen. We are only working on the

887
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:55,600
left-hand side with the right hand, so we
put our hand on the upper portion of our abdomen

888
01:47:55,600 --> 01:48:02,600
on the left-hand side, please. Now, this is
the center of our Mastery. Then we put our

889
01:48:07,090 --> 01:48:12,950
hand in the lower position of the abdomen,
in the lower position of the abdomen on the

890
01:48:12,950 --> 01:48:19,440
left-hand side, now this is the center of
pure knowledge. Pure knowledge means the one

891
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:26,440
that manifests on your central nervous system.
Is not the knowledge of your reading or your

892
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:34,640
intellect, but is the knowledge that manifests
on your central nervous system, is the pure

893
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:41,640
knowledge. Then your raise your hand again
on the upper portion of the abdomen on the

894
01:48:42,010 --> 01:48:49,010
left-hand side, and then on your heart, then
in the corner of your neck and your head [SOUNDS

895
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:58,770
LIKE: turn it OR took him OR it??] backwards
as much as possible, and then turn your head

896
01:48:58,770 --> 01:49:05,770
to your right. This is the center that’s
get caught up when you feel guilt and gives

897
01:49:12,270 --> 01:49:18,990
you lots of problems. This is the worst center
and I see, today also, you all are catching

898
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:24,840
it, so at the very outset, just know that
you are not guilty at all, please believe

899
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:29,530
Me, you [SOUNDS LIKE: are not guilty OR have
not guilt], it’s your own mental idea. You

900
01:49:29,530 --> 01:49:36,530
are not at all guilty, you have nothing done
wrong! Alright. Then you’ll take your right

901
01:49:36,850 --> 01:49:43,850
hand on top of your forehead across like this,
and put down your head, and press it on both

902
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:52,570
the sides. Now, this is the center where you
have to forgive everyone. Now, take back your

903
01:49:58,220 --> 01:50:04,210
hand on the backside of your head, and push
back your head as much as possible, resting

904
01:50:04,210 --> 01:50:11,210
on the hand and here, for your own satisfaction,
you have to ask forgiveness from this Divine

905
01:50:14,490 --> 01:50:21,490
power, just for your satisfaction, so that
you don’t feel guilty at all. Now, you have

906
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:28,890
to stretch your palm fully, fully, stretch,
and the center of your palm you have to put

907
01:50:30,370 --> 01:50:37,370
on top of the fontanel bone area, which was
a soft area when you were a child. Here, now,

908
01:50:38,570 --> 01:50:45,570
put on your head and press back your fingers
as far as possible and move your hand, move

909
01:50:50,610 --> 01:50:57,610
your hand in the clockwise manner. Put down
your head and move your hand in clockwise

910
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:05,940
manner, very slowly, so that you move the
scalp with a pressure, with a pressure, push

911
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:14,150
back your fingers, so you put a proper pressure
on, seven times, clockwise. That’s all we

912
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:28,460
have to do, that’s all. Now, please put
your feet on both the, little away from each

913
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:37,860
other because these are two powers, as I told
you. Now, put the left hand towards Me. You

914
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:44,030
may to take out your spectacles because when
you close your eyes, you shouldn’t open

915
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:51,030
them till I tell you, and it’s better to
take out your spectacles. Now, please, close

916
01:51:54,490 --> 01:52:01,280
your eyes. You should be very pleasantly [SOUNDS
LIKE: placed towards?] yourself because you

917
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:06,830
are going to enter into to the kingdom of
God.

918
01:52:06,830 --> 01:52:13,830
Now, put your right hand on your heart, please.
Here, you have to ask Me a very fundamental

919
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:22,610
question, three times. You may call Me “Shri
Mataji” or you can call Me “Mother”,

920
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:29,610
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask in your
heart, not loudly, three times. “Mother,

921
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:43,300
am I the Spirit?” If you are the Spirit,
you are your Master. So now, please take your

922
01:52:52,270 --> 01:52:59,270
right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen,
press it hard, and here ask a question, with

923
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:10,520
deliberation you must ask, another question.
“Mother, am I my own Master?”, or “Mother,

924
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:18,620
am I my own Guru?” Ask this question, three
times.

925
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:35,480
Now, I must tell you that I respect your freedom,
and the pure knowledge cannot be forced on

926
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:47,400
you, so you have to ask for it. Now, please,
put your right hand in the lower portion of

927
01:53:49,890 --> 01:53:56,890
your abdomen on the left-hand side and press
it hard. And here you have to say six times

928
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:05,670
because this center has got six petals, “Mother,
please give me pure knowledge.” You have

929
01:54:06,930 --> 01:54:11,840
to ask for it, I cannot force on you, and
don't’ feel guilty. I feel, you people are

930
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:18,840
feeling guilty for everything. There is no
need to feel guilty at all. With full confidence

931
01:54:18,940 --> 01:54:25,940
you ask for pure knowledge, “Mother, please
give me pure knowledge.” You have to have

932
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:33,670
full confidence in yourself. This is what
I have told you at the very outset that you

933
01:54:33,670 --> 01:54:40,670
all are capable of getting your Self-Realization.
So now, we have to nourish our upper centers

934
01:54:40,990 --> 01:54:47,990
with self-confidence because when you ask
for pure knowledge, the Kundalini has started

935
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:56,500
its movement upward. Now raise your right
hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

936
01:54:56,500 --> 01:55:03,500
and press it hard on the left-hand side. Now,
here, with full confidence, you say ten times,

937
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:12,480
“Mother, I am my own Master”, or say “Mother,
I am my own Guru.” Say ten times, with full

938
01:55:13,330 --> 01:55:20,330
confidence, which you are. I have told you
that the truth is that you are the pure Spirit.

939
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:39,800
You are not this body, you are not this mind,
you are not this intellect, you are not these

940
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:46,800
emotions, but you are pure Spirit. So now,
please raise your hand and place it on your

941
01:55:54,400 --> 01:56:01,400
heart, and here again you say with full confidence,
“Mother, I am the Spirit”, “Mother,

942
01:56:07,490 --> 01:56:14,490
I am the pure Spirit”, please say it.
The Divine power is the ocean of knowledge

943
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:37,150
and of love, it is the ocean of compassion
and blessings, but above all, it is the ocean

944
01:56:43,030 --> 01:56:50,030
of forgiveness. So, whatever mistakes you
might have committed, this ocean is so powerful

945
01:56:55,090 --> 01:57:02,090
that it dissolves all such mistakes into nothing.
So, please, believe that you are not guilty

946
01:57:08,490 --> 01:57:15,490
at all of anything, please! Now, raise your
hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

947
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:27,580
and turn your head to [SOUNDS LIKE: a OR the??]
right, and here you have to say with full

948
01:57:29,990 --> 01:57:36,990
confidence, please say it with full confidence,
sixteen times, “Mother, I am not guilty

949
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:47,350
at all.” Please say it sixteen times, this
is the center you are catching very badly,

950
01:57:47,350 --> 01:57:54,350
please say it sixteen times with full confidence,
I assure you that you are not guilty of any

951
01:57:56,850 --> 01:58:03,850
mistakes, please, believe Me! Now, sixteen
times you have to say. Now, you have to forgive

952
01:58:32,670 --> 01:58:39,640
everyone, as I explained you beforehand that
whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

953
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:46,640
you don't do anything, but you play into wrong
hands. So please, please, forgive everyone,

954
01:58:49,900 --> 01:58:56,900
just forgive everyone without thinking about
them, without counting them, just forgive

955
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:04,400
everyone in general. Please do that, it will
help you and help Me a lot to open this center.

956
01:59:06,010 --> 01:59:13,010
Now raise your right hand on your forehead
across and put down your head and press on

957
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:22,550
both the sides. At this center, you have to
say with full confidence, “Mother, I forgive

958
01:59:31,550 --> 01:59:38,550
everyone.” Now, not how many times, but
from your heart, believing in it, please say,

959
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:51,940
“Mother, I forgive everyone.” Now, for
your own satisfaction, I have warned you not

960
02:00:07,190 --> 02:00:14,190
to feel guilty at all, you put your right
hand on the backside of your head and push

961
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:21,300
back your head, as far as possible upward.
Here, you have to say, for your own satisfaction,

962
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:33,500
not counting your mistakes or feeling guilty,
“Oh Devine Power, if I have done any mistakes,

963
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:42,170
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me.”
This also you have to say from your heart,

964
02:00:42,170 --> 02:00:49,170
not how many times. “Oh Devine Power, if
I have done any mistakes, knowingly or unknowingly,

965
02:00:53,250 --> 02:01:00,250
please forgive me”.
Now, stretch your hand, your palm, in such

966
02:01:05,770 --> 02:01:12,770
a way that your fingers are pushed back. Put
the center of your palm exactly on the place

967
02:01:15,770 --> 02:01:22,770
known as the fontanel bone area where you
had a soft bone in your childhood. Now press

968
02:01:23,470 --> 02:01:29,380
it hard, push back your finger, very important
to push back your fingers. Now, put down your

969
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:36,380
head as far as you can, and carefully you
have to move your scalp, but before that I

970
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:47,320
have to tell you that I cannot force Self-Realization
on you. I respect your freedom, you have to

971
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:54,360
ask for it, so you move your right hand with
big pressure on your scalp, seven times, slowly,

972
02:01:56,990 --> 02:02:02,420
clockwise, saying, “Mother, please give
me my Self-Realization.”

973
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:09,420
[MOTHER GIVES THE SELF-REALIZATION]
Now, please, take down your hands and slowly

974
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:04,760
open your eyes. Now, put your right hand towards
Me like this, little higher, and put down

975
02:03:11,340 --> 02:03:18,340
your head and see for yourself, you have to
be certify if there is a cool or hot breeze

976
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:23,590
coming out of your head. Some people will
get hot because the heat has to come out,

977
02:03:23,590 --> 02:03:29,510
put down your head and see for yourself. Don’t
touch your head, little away, some people

978
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:36,510
get it very much further down, but still,
you can see it here. Now, don't touch, don't

979
02:03:45,190 --> 02:03:50,920
touch your head, don't touch, take it further,
it’s not to touch, alright. Now, put your

980
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:57,920
left hand towards Me, please put your left
hand like this, like this, like this, left

981
02:03:57,990 --> 02:04:04,670
hand, now put down your head and see for yourself,
but not touching it, further away. There should

982
02:04:04,670 --> 02:04:10,630
be a distance between your head and you hand,
please see now. Is there a cool breeze or

983
02:04:10,630 --> 02:04:17,630
a hot breeze coming out of your head? Now,
again the right hand, and put down your head

984
02:04:27,950 --> 02:04:34,950
again and see with the left hand. Now, put
your both the hands, put up your, both the

985
02:04:46,130 --> 02:04:51,930
hands like this, push back your head and ask
a question, “Mother, is this the cool breeze

986
02:04:51,930 --> 02:04:58,930
of the Holy Ghost?” “Mother, is this the
All-Pervading Power of God?”, or “Mother,

987
02:04:59,150 --> 02:05:06,030
is this the Paramchaitanya?” Ask anyone
of these questions three times, put back your

988
02:05:06,030 --> 02:05:13,030
head and ask.
Now, put down your hands, please. Now you

989
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:30,400
watch Me without thinking, you can do it,
without thinking. Now, those who have felt

990
02:05:32,090 --> 02:05:39,090
the cool or the hot breeze out of their heads
or on their hands or fingertips, please raise

991
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:46,680
both your hands, both your hands, both.
Just imagine, the whole of San Diego, may

992
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:55,900
God bless you all! You felt it? So, this is
the city of Devas, the city of Gods, and now

993
02:05:59,540 --> 02:06:06,540
you are the Saints, but you must look after
your ascent and your fixing up the ascent,

994
02:06:07,970 --> 02:06:12,450
that's all you have to do. Little steadily,
those who haven’t got Realization also,

995
02:06:12,450 --> 02:06:17,190
[SOUNDS LIKE: with all of them get OR all
of them will get??], you can go and see the

996
02:06:17,190 --> 02:06:22,460
people who are here, they have been working
here for so many days, but what they say that,

997
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:27,100
“People come here and then go somewhere
else, and then go somewhere else”, this

998
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:32,570
is not the way it is going to work out. You
must pay full attention and you must work

999
02:06:32,570 --> 02:06:39,570
it out throughout and master it, absolutely
master it. You can do it, I know, you can

1000
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:46,940
do it, it’s very easy.
So, may God bless you all, and next year I’ll

1001
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:53,940
be again back here and see you all, may God
bless you! Now, use your hands, use your hands

1002
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:59,690
and see that how you can help people, how
you can help yourself. They’ll teach you

1003
02:06:59,690 --> 02:07:05,190
everything, how to raise your Kundalini, the
whole technique. I told you that in the Veda

1004
02:07:05,190 --> 02:07:10,420
there is written that you must Mantra, Yantra
and Tantra, three things after Realization,

1005
02:07:10,420 --> 02:07:17,420
that is the “Mantra” is the chanting,
what is to be used for Raising the Kundalini,

1006
02:07:17,590 --> 02:07:24,590
and “Tantra” is the one which is the technique,
and “Yantra” is the mechanism. Everything

1007
02:07:25,090 --> 02:07:31,300
you will know, in no time, only thing you
should assiduously work it out and respect

1008
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:37,180
your Self-Realization, respect your Self-Realization.
You are very important, I think, San Diego

1009
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:43,360
people are the most important people for the
whole of America. Please, I hope, you’ll

1010
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:50,360
not let me down.
May God bless you!
