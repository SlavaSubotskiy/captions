1
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,230
Today we have gathered here to worship the Adi Kundalini

2
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,180
and your own Kundalini, both of them,

3
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,110
because your Kundalini is the reflection

4
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,070
of the Adi Kundalini.

5
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,010
We have understood a lot

6
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,170
about Kundalini

7
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,010
and also we know that

8
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,200
through Her awakening only,

9
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,180
through Her ascent only,

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,070
we have ascended into a very higher realm of consciousness.

11
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,170
It's not only that we have risen to a very higher realm

12
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,230
of awareness

13
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:01,030
but that it has granted us so many powers that,

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,180
never before in the history of spirituality

15
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,040
people had

16
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,230
this power of awakening of Kundalini.

17
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,040
As soon as they got their awakening perhaps,

18
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,070
they went more on to the left or to the right,

19
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,210
and tried to achieve powers

20
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:36,100
which were not so much for the benevolence of others.

21
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,050
Buddha has written clearly

22
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,210
that, “When the incarnation of future Buddha,

23
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,050
that is Maitreya, three Mothers put together, comes in,

24
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:56,040
that time it will be used for the benevolence of people.”

25
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,100
This is one of the signs,

26
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,100
"of the people",

27
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,100
not only of Sahaja Yogis but of the people.

28
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:14,150
So how can it be unless and until those who are Buddhas,

29
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,220
means those who are Realized souls

30
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,220
know the science of Kundalini?

31
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,080
Those people who had very little knowledge about Kundalini,

32
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,130
who must have read in some scriptures

33
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,020
or somewhere which is being described,

34
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,000
started misusing it

35
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,190
and so they became tantrikas.

36
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,040
But tantra, as you know very well,

37
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:55,110
is the mechanism of Kundalini,

38
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,070
and the yantra is the Kundalini itself,

39
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,100
is the machine.

40
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,150
Today I think,

41
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,040
as we know so much about Kundalini,

42
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,010
how it passes through different centers,

43
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,130
how it rises, all those things as we know,

44
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,020
we should find out how we can nourish our Kundalini.

45
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,190
That's very important to know.

46
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:40,130
First of all there's a big difference between

47
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,160
you people and other people who got their Realization.

48
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,240
First big difference is this,

49
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:58,100
that this power you have achieved Sahaj, easily.

50
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,190
Others had to go to Himalayas,

51
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,210
stand in the cold air for days together, so many died,

52
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,050
live in the caves,

53
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,050
eating fruits,

54
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,180
sometimes nothing.

55
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:23,060
Even Buddha's time they had to use only one piece of cloth

56
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,090
to cover their body

57
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,060
and they had to ask for alms

58
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:41,030
in the villages and somehow cook some food and eat it

59
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,220
- whether it was cold or hot, no comforts.

60
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,000
On the contrary,

61
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:54,200
He taught them that you should give up all our comforts

62
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,170
because you can live without comforts.

63
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:05,200
But none of them got Realization

64
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,110
and none of them could do the work

65
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,040
of awakening of Kundalini.

66
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:23,060
So the difference is too much,

67
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,070
the way you got your Realization,

68
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:32,010
the way your Kundalini, in a very Sahaj manner, was awakened

69
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,170
and the way you are manifesting those powers

70
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,150
that you have got.

71
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,200
For example you can give Realization to others,

72
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,030
you can cure others,

73
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,040
you can feel the vibrations of others,

74
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,000
there are some Sahaja Yogis

75
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,080
who can control rain, sun, moon, everything.

76
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,120
Sahaja Yogis, some of them,

77
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,000
have tremendous powers of prayers.

78
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,020
Just by praying they have saved the lives of many people.

79
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:15,060
And these powers were available to some of them,

80
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:22,230
even to the rishis and great munis on those days,

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
but their powers were not based on love and compassion.

82
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,130
This is your special field

83
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:41,030
because you have to work for the benevolence of the people.

84
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,110
Their field was to protect themselves

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,060
or to destroy.

86
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,020
So they developed powers of curses,

87
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,140
like sharp,

88
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,030
they could curse people.

89
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,000
You haven't got that power;

90
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,220
you cannot curse anyone.

91
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:11,020
Very nicely that power I have cancelled.

92
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,050
Nor do I curse, I can, but I never curse anyone,

93
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:29,230
because our basis is love and compassion and tenderliness.

94
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,130
They were very hot-tempered people, most of them,

95
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,060
extremely hot temper,

96
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,000
and sometimes they used also terrible harsh languages

97
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,230
whenever they spoke about the people

98
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,120
who were not realized or who were troubling them.

99
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,190
This was very funny

100
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,120
the way they were angry with the society,

101
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,230
the way they described them.

102
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,080
Some of them did not look at the society,

103
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,060
did not denounce the society,

104
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,110
did not say bad things about the society

105
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,190
but they were only satisfied with themselves

106
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,110
or they wrote about the blessings that they are having.

107
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,220
But you have a new dimension;

108
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,200
you have to use your powers

109
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,180
for the benevolence of the people.

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,080
So also, your Kundalini was awakened so Sahaj;

111
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:51,220
it is because of the love and compassion of your Mother.

112
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,090
So this time, we should say,

113
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,120
your Kundalini can only be nourished

114
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,060
if you develop within yourself

115
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:12,140
the sense of pure love and pure compassion.

116
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,140
First I've used the word “pure”, that's My name also.

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,090
That means you have to be innocent to begin with.

118
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:32,090
If you are not innocent then you have certain problems,

119
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,010
maybe with your lust.

120
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,060
Maybe your love might be directed

121
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,090
towards some person, only.

122
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,150
Kundalini is not like that.

123
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,150
She rises, She goes to all the chakras,

124
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,120
She doesn't get involved into any,

125
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,200
She tries to cure every chakra, nourish that chakra,

126
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,140
and She is only worried about Her ascent.

127
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,010
In the same way a Sahaja Yogi

128
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,100
should not get involved

129
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,010
into any relationship as such.

130
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,060
Is possible.

131
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,060
You don't have to become like Buddha's disciples.

132
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,100
For example, as I have always told you,

133
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,210
the sap in the tree rises

134
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,210
and goes to various parts of the tree

135
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,030
and then evaporates or comes back.

136
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,070
So this passage should be kept open,

137
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,150
and once this passage is kept open

138
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,090
the Kundalini can rise very easily without any trouble.

139
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,230
But this passage can be closed,

140
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,040
in case you get too much involved into one thing,

141
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,100
because there are some people

142
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:10,000
who get involved, say in their parents to begin with.

143
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,090
All right, in the beginning I know,

144
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,120
those who come in the beginning to Sahaja Yoga,

145
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,100
will start saying, “Mother, my father's, sister's,

146
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,090
husband's, this things, that, is sick,

147
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,010
so will you please cure that person.” Very common.

148
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,040
They'll write long, long letters

149
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,140
describing the relationship

150
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:36,010
and I really lose the connection - who is this one?

151
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,150
Without writing the names

152
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,010
they will give all the connections that they have.

153
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,200
These are all artificial connections.

154
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,040
Tomorrow some calamity comes on you,

155
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,070
these relationships are of no use;

156
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,140
on the contrary you'll find they'll take advantage of it.

157
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,170
You cannot depend on these relations of yours,

158
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,170
in what family you were born,

159
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,070
in what religion you were born,

160
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,170
in what country you are born,

161
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,170
because now you are a universal being.

162
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,210
So you are no more related

163
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,070
through these artificial relationships

164
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:22,200
but you are related through your spiritual relationships.

165
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:29,000
Unless and until we establish that within ourselves

166
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,180
- that doesn't mean you give up your husband,

167
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
give up your wife, give up your children,

168
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,230
nothing of the kind;

169
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:41,000
but that means that if we have to give up our conditionings

170
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,170
we have to give up all these things.

171
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,070
There are all kinds of conditionings we have.

172
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,150
If there are some good conditionings,

173
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,150
still we should give up

174
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,150
in the sense they should not be conditionings

175
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,230
but we should be master of them.

176
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,060
For example Indians have one good conditioning, in a way,

177
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,150
in their own country,

178
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,120
that they must have their bath early in the morning.

179
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,120
I used to do the same.

180
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,120
Then England is horrible for that.

181
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,120
It takes its respite, if you do that in England,

182
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,170
it's a cursed country,

183
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,200
you just can't do that.

184
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,140
You have to take your bath in the night

185
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,200
otherwise give up bathing;

186
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,120
and one has to change.

187
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,050
But if you have that conditioning,

188
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,110
then you will feel very sad,

189
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,160
“Oh, oh, I've missed my bath, I'm feeling,

190
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:42,070
I can't sleep now, I can't feel all right, I am not normal.”

191
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:46,110
It’s a good conditioning but still it is enslaving you.

192
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,190
So whether it is good or bad,

193
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,190
if it is a conditioning

194
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,130
you should try to see it clearly, it's a conditioning.

195
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,000
That doesn't mean that you should go

196
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,070
in the opposite direction,

197
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,010
that, "All right I'll never have my bath",

198
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,000
that's not the way.

199
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,010
It is that,

200
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,010
"All right if it doesn't suit in the morning

201
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,110
I'll have it in the evening,

202
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,170
also doesn't matter once in a while I'll miss it.

203
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,120
The bath cannot control me, I'll control the bath."

204
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,230
Nothing should control you,

205
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,110
then the Kundalini moves for us,

206
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,120
because you must have complete liberty.

207
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,150
If you do not have complete liberty

208
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,010
then the Kundalini won't move.

209
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,210
We have conditionings of our families,

210
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,010
of our religion,

211
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,030
of our country.

212
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,150
These conditionings, as far as possible,

213
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,120
is to be seen clearly that we have got it through our

214
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,070
family.

215
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,170
If you are born a Christian

216
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,010
you'll always be more attached to Christ.

217
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,120
Christ you have not seen,

218
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,150
you don't know whether He existed or not,

219
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,140
whether this Bible is true or not

220
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,180
but you'll be more attached to Bible.

221
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,230
Now if you are a Hindu,

222
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,040
you'll be more attached to Gita or to Vedas or something.

223
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,010
This creates imbalance,

224
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,000
because we must have the same attitude

225
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,180
towards all the religions, towards all the scriptures;

226
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,140
that's the sign of a saint.

227
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,070
So this conditioning has to go.

228
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,140
In what country you are born is another conditioning

229
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,150
which has to be fought out;

230
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,030
very important it is.

231
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't want to discuss the conditionings

232
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,040
of different countries but you know very well.

233
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,030
After Realization when you rise higher

234
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,200
than your society which is surrounding you,

235
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,070
you start understanding and you start describing.

236
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,200
I've come to know about the stupidity

237
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,150
of all these countries through the people

238
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,150
who belong to that country.

239
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,150
For example a Frenchman will say,

240
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,140
“Mother, this is typical French mind,

241
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,040
he's a French otherwise born.”

242
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,000
Or a Hindu will say,

243
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,000
“Mother, this is typically a Hindu man,

244
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,200
he will do like this.”

245
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,170
So then you understand that you are not typifying

246
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,070
that country,

247
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,030
you are a universal being

248
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,000
and you are living like a universal being.

249
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,210
Once you become the universal being

250
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,200
then also you realize that this skin-deep complexion

251
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,000
makes no difference in the world.

252
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,060
So then you don't start hating somebody

253
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,090
who is darker than you or who is fairer than you;

254
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,030
both ways it works.

255
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:16,230
It's not only the people who are fair hate the darker ones,

256
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,170
but “darkers” also hate equally.

257
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,220
And mutually they believe that they are all

258
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,110
absolutely wrong.

259
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,120
If you ask a fanatic

260
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,000
about another religion he'll say,

261
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,180
that's the worst religion, his is the best.

262
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,030
And you ask the another fanatic,

263
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:46,060
he will say his is the best, the rest of it is the worst.

264
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,170
That means all of them are the worst,

265
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,110
in a general opinion.

266
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,010
Everybody seems to be the worst,

267
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,180
all the fanatics are the worst,

268
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,200
if you take a general consensus, you see.

269
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,230
Nobody will say that,

270
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,150
"All right, my religion is all right

271
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,220
and at least one another is all right", nobody.

272
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,040
If you ask an Englishman he'll say,

273
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,070
“Mother, this is typically English, you can't help it.”

274
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,120
They get so angry, I've seen the English getting angry

275
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,070
with the other English for misbehaving

276
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,110
or doing something towards Me, but I don't,

277
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,180
because they are blind.

278
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,110
So here the compassion should come within you,

279
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,200
as a universal being,

280
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,180
that by God's grace you have risen higher

281
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,110
in the real sense of the word.

282
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,070
It is not just you are certified,

283
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,030
you are realized souls, no.

284
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:44,200
You are realized souls, no doubt, you are - sakshat.

285
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,170
So then, as it is now, you are absolutely certified by God

286
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,230
that you are realized souls.

287
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,170
Naturally you must change everything.

288
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,070
No use typifying yourself, identifying yourself

289
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,170
with something that is now, you have given up.

290
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,180
For example, from the egg now you have become the birds.

291
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:18,090
Now birds don't identify themselves with the eggs

292
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,110
and settle down in only one place, they fly.

293
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,030
Now they have become birds, they are no more eggs.

294
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,000
In the same way we should accept our position.

295
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:33,070
We should accept ourselves as realized souls

296
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,150
with self-esteem and understanding

297
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,090
as to what is our purpose of life now;

298
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,180
it is changed completely, entirely.

299
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,070
Once you understand the purpose of your life,

300
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,090
innately, not outside because I am saying,

301
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,000
or is a mental process,

302
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,030
but inside you feel responsible.

303
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:57,140
You have got Realization to spread it all over the world

304
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,120
and to emancipate the whole world.

305
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,200
Once you realize this point

306
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,060
then automatically you take up responsibilities

307
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,120
and the Kundalini will rise.

308
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,060
I know of many people who said,

309
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,010
“Mother, we cannot speak, You know we have a stage fright.”

310
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,170
All right, you just stand up, that's all.

311
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,180
And they started giving lectures; I had to stop them.

312
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,120
There are many who said that,

313
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,060
“We cannot write any poems Mother, we are no good,

314
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,230
we cannot sing.”

315
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,030
I know of a girl who used to sing so horribly bad

316
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,090
that people had to tell her that you…

317
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,090
because she would always go out of tune

318
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,080
and very loudly she would sing;

319
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,220
then they had to tell her,

320
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,060
“Now you better keep at the back

321
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,060
and don't sing now any more.”

322
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:51,220
Now she is the one who is sort of leading the group.

323
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,030
So all these beautiful things start manifesting

324
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,050
which you should accept that they have come to you,

325
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,020
and give up all that you call as fear.

326
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,090
All kinds of fear we have.

327
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,030
These are all left-sided things as you have seen yesterday,

328
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,050
left-sided man what he should do.

329
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,000
But what a left-sided man has to know

330
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,200
that he is now an enlightened soul

331
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:32,140
and no one can touch him, leave alone destroy.

332
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,140
No saint will be destroyed.

333
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,240
Those who will try to destroy you

334
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,060
will, in a very interesting manner, will be finished.

335
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,240
Not destroyed but very interesting manner,

336
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,060
very jocular manner.

337
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,090
You'll laugh at

338
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,240
that and you will enjoy the way things are working out.

339
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,060
Like there's a saying in Sanskrit,

340
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
“vinashkale viprit budhi,”

341
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:04,100
means their destruction will start

342
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,170
by their own stupid methods.

343
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,010
They'll become stupid.

344
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,170
And at every stage you'll see they are becoming stupid

345
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,120
and by that stupidity they are destroying themselves.

346
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,120
You don't have to worry about that part.

347
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,020
So that's why you don't need any destructive powers.

348
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:28,010
It will all be done by this all-pervading Divine Power.

349
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,230
So that part you have to give up.

350
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,060
You just forgive that person.

351
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,240
As soon as you forgive,

352
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,130
the responsibility from you shifts

353
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,120
and then Kundalini rises.

354
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,100
You don't have to carry any malice, anything against him,

355
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,040
but just laugh because they are blind,

356
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,240
because they are stupid,

357
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,180
they are foolish.

358
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,060
What do we do if you see an idiot?

359
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,130
We may not laugh in his presence but we do,

360
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:11,130
isn't it, at his back, because he's an idiot.

361
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,170
So they become idiotic

362
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,030
and you see them becoming idiotic and then you just start.

363
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,240
You see that's the humor of Sahaja Yoga,

364
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,120
you have to have some humor also, isn't it?

365
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,060
And then you start seeing these jokers you see,

366
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,020
behaving in that manner

367
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,150
and the whole circus they do is nothing but jocular.

368
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:40,150
So there's nothing to have any fear from any human being;

369
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,060
same about organizations or anything.

370
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,200
Naturally you have to know one thing:

371
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,060
that as you are Realized souls,

372
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,100
you have seen the truth,

373
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,180
you are in the light so they are going to oppose you,

374
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,150
they are going to oppose you.

375
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,190
They did this, isn't it, to others;

376
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,150
everybody suffered so much.

377
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,100
But now no more sufferings to you,

378
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,160
only thing you can enjoy the humor.

379
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,150
Just understand this point,

380
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,140
that nothing will destroy you, no one can touch you

381
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,080
but they are there just to supply some humor for you.

382
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,230
If you take such a light attitude towards them,

383
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,040
all this fear and left side will go away.

384
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,170
What are these baddhas, and what are these bhoots,

385
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,120
and what are these tantrikas? Nothing.

386
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,150
You are so powerful.

387
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,140
Just with one glance

388
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,000
you can see them dancing on their heads,

389
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,080
the other way round.

390
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,110
As long as you'll have fear

391
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:59,030
Kundalini won't rise because She doesn't rise for people

392
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,060
who are cowards.

393
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,200
Cowardice She is not going to support.

394
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,170
If you are a coward She said, “All right”.

395
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,140
You are walking on the street,

396
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,120
normally people are afraid if there's darkness,

397
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,030
afraid that somebody might attack,

398
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,090
but a Sahaja Yogi does not,

399
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,150
if he's a real Sahaja Yogi,

400
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,060
because he knows there are ganas

401
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,030
and there are angels around him.

402
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,010
No one can touch him,

403
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,110
and the one who will try,

404
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,230
these ganas will make such a fool out of that person

405
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,120
that you'll have a nice chance to laugh at him.

406
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,080
Now you watch and see.

407
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:47,200
So this left side or this fear should go.

408
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,000
Once this fear will go all your slyness,

409
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:57,200
all your intrigues, all your jealousies will just disappear.

410
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,010
That's how the Kundalini will rise very well.

411
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:16,120
Then another problem is for the awakening of the Kundalini,

412
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,140
is your ego.

413
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,040
That's tremendous, I must admit,

414
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,040
rather too much for people who follow Christ,

415
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,000
is very surprising and those who follow Buddha,

416
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,230
because they are anti-Christ,

417
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,200
because they are anti-Buddha.

418
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,120
The one who on the cross said that,

419
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,120
“Oh Father,

420
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,000
forgive them for they do not know what they are doing”;

421
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,230
if you are following Him how can you have ego?

422
00:27:52,230 --> 00:28:01,040
Now the forgiveness should be absolutely spontaneous within.

423
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:11,190
There should be no ripple even of anger

424
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,150
because you are so powerful.

425
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:21,090
What can anybody harm you?

426
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,170
But if you catch on your Agnya,

427
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,060
only you are harming yourself.

428
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,090
If you want to harm yourself nobody can help it.

429
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,190
So this anger, which comes from liver

430
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:41,080
and settles down in your Agnya, has to be looked into.

431
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,190
That's a very important thing where Kundalini stops,

432
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,230
in the West specially.

433
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,130
Because this whole culture here has created two problems.

434
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:04,020
The first one is acquisition instinct,

435
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,130
what you call as greed.

436
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:14,130
The more greed you have the more these machines can run

437
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:19,140
and you can have industrial development of plastics,

438
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:24,060
and then have a conference against ecology.

439
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,100
In Spain I saw,

440
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,200
I don't know, there must be three, four car factories

441
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,080
because every car had only one driver

442
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,170
because it had to be there.

443
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:41,110
And so many cars

444
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,060
that you just don't know how to move.

445
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,130
For your program also is impossible,

446
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,130
you must start two hours earlier

447
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,200
when you can just take fifteen minutes.

448
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:57,020
In France is another thing, Paris.

449
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,050
Paris, if you want to go somewhere

450
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,130
you should start at four o'clock in the morning,

451
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,060
otherwise you cannot reach that place.

452
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:13,190
Same about Milan and same about Rome.

453
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,140
The worst is Switzerland,

454
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,040
I don't know what to say about Switzerland,

455
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,040
the name itself is rather, very dangerous,

456
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,190
because they are making all ugly money,

457
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,070
they are doing all these things,

458
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,160
I mean every kind of sin they have got

459
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,150
in the name of acquisition.

460
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,230
For them nothing like sin, taking somebody's money nicely,

461
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,070
keeping that there, extracting money from poor countries,

462
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,210
keeping, they don't feel there's anything wrong,

463
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,010
I mean, they have become immune.

464
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,150
So this acquisition instinct that we have

465
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,200
and which has been very much fanned

466
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:06,240
and has been made into a big sort of a quality in the West,

467
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,150
we should try to see it clearly.

468
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:18,090
In the olden days in the same European countries

469
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,120
this was used for creating art,

470
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,130
for producing artist, for supporting artist.

471
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,040
Even in our country,

472
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,200
artists were supported by the kings

473
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,090
and all the big empires that we had.

474
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,020
These days there's no question,

475
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,070
no government is willing to support the artist.

476
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,150
You know that Mozart was called by the queen herself

477
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
to play before her.

478
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,020
So the governments were not only looking after

479
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,010
the collection of taxes

480
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,200
but they were looking after the artists,

481
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:07,130
musicians, painters and people who did creative art.

482
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,240
Like in France you can see

483
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:16,120
how their queen collected beautiful artistic things

484
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,240
and encouraged artists

485
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,090
to do artistic work,

486
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,180
spent her money in that,

487
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:30,200
and now, you know that she was killed by people.

488
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,100
By killing her they have killed the art of France.

489
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:44,090
And now the French themselves have become bourgeois,

490
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,130
those whom they condemned, they have become that.

491
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,120
So acquisition instinct

492
00:32:51,180 --> 00:33:00,020
has to be taken to the acquisition of art.

493
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:08,010
That also should not be plastic

494
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,160
otherwise tomorrow we might start buying plastic

495
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,240
artistic things.

496
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:18,180
Genuinely made, hand made things.

497
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,240
Or the music also which is very deep,

498
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,130
classical, singing the songs of the Divine;

499
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,070
not the cheap type music which just makes you mad

500
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:41,160
or makes you full of lust and greed.

501
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:46,040
So this is one of the problems of your culture

502
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,230
which gives you this kind of a ego.

503
00:33:54,060 --> 00:34:01,060
I mean, people if they have say, a Rolls Royce

504
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,160
then of course nobody can talk to them,

505
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,070
their brain has blown out of their hats, completely.

506
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,210
But even the driver of the Rolls Royce

507
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,060
who doesn't own the Rolls Royce, he drives it,

508
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,170
his head is off.

509
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:22,150
He has a different gait, he walks in a different way,

510
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,040
he talks in a different way.

511
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,150
So this acquisition instinct gives you so much of ego.

512
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,180
I mean, you go to somebody's house,

513
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,180
like some stupid Indians who are now in England

514
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,010
I went to their house;

515
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,240
they're sadarjis - means following the path of Guru Nanaka

516
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,200
where drinking is not allowed.

517
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,230
So as soon as you rise he shows us a pub in his house.

518
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:03,240
“My God,” I said. I went back three, four steps, you see.

519
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,060
He says, “See my pubu,” as he says,

520
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:14,090
and from the pub he takes out a soda thing and shows us how

521
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,100
it pumps out the soda, just imagine

522
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,180
and he wouldn't talk, you know.

523
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,120
And when we said, "We don't drink,"

524
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,240
he thought we were sinners of the worst type,

525
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,070
that we don't drink.

526
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,040
So this acquisition instinct is now ending up

527
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:44,020
into something which is very cheap, vulgar and immoral.

528
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,170
The fondness for showing off

529
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:57,220
is so much that you are sometimes shocked,

530
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,120
the way people try to show off.

531
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:05,090
Like a American lady came from America

532
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,060
and she asked Me, “Mrs. Srivastava,

533
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:11,030
how many pubs You have seen in London?”

534
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,090
I said, “None.”

535
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:20,190
“Oh, You are good for nothing, useless, absolutely.

536
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,190
You haven't seen any pub. The best houses in any village,

537
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,140
any city in England is a pub.”

538
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,040
I said, “From outside I have seen.”

539
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,020
All right, just to satisfy;

540
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,070
I thought she’s artistic.

541
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,190
“No, no, no, no. Do You know the best pub in London?”

542
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,160
She gave Me the list, you know.

543
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,200
I said, “Which one is the best?”

544
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,120
“There was one called Hermit's Pub.”

545
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,190
I said: "What is this supposed to be?"

546
00:36:55,070 --> 00:37:00,040
"You know, the man who was living in this house died

547
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,070
and nobody knew that he's dead,

548
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:09,070
so for months together nobody went in

549
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:12,100
and the whole place was filled with that stink,

550
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,040
and lots of cobwebs were there.

551
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,200
Then they removed that

552
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,130
dead body from there,

553
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,240
and the stink is still there and the cobwebs,

554
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,090
absolutely intact, you know.

555
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,070
You have to be careful that you don't break them.

556
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:40,040
And there, that is the best pub,

557
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,090
for which you have to pay quite a lot.

558
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,130
And I have seen that.”

559
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,160
So proud. So where does it end then?

560
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:55,200
This acquisition instinct ends in where?

561
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:00,210
In rottening things, in putrefying,

562
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,120
you may call it fermenting.

563
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,050
It has to end up

564
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,160
because the reaction of the ego comes

565
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:17,130
and you start enjoying things which are rotten.

566
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,240
Like cheese of France,

567
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:26,090
never eat that, I tell you, you'll burn your finger,

568
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,150
you will burn your throat and you'll burn your stomach.

569
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,020
It is very rotten,

570
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,150
and the more rotten it is the better.

571
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:43,100
The wine, the wine is the rotten grape juice,

572
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,040
absolutely rotten,

573
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,180
you can't take it,

574
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:51,200
it smells, I've seen smells like a rotten cork.

575
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,130
I asked somebody, “How does it smell?”

576
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,200
He said, “It's very fine.”

577
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:03,050
I said, “Does it smell like rotten cork?”

578
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,050
“I've never smelt a cork.”

579
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,210
That's why I said - if he had smelt a rotten cork

580
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,180
he would never have taken to wine;

581
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:15,230
so all things that are rotten.

582
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,200
You know the discovery of cheese, what had happened,

583
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,190
how it started, do you know that?

584
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:27,010
There was a big snowfall and milk was left in one cave.

585
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,180
So because of the snowfall everybody forgot about the milk,

586
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:37,210
it was left there, then summer time the milk became rotten,

587
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,150
then it became more rotten, more rotten.

588
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,020
After twelve years or so, somebody went and saw this there.

589
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:57,160
Thank God I have not taken My food today.

590
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:06,120
And so they took that milk,

591
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,040
they called it cheese.

592
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:17,120
In India cheez is used in Urdu language specially,

593
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,200
for something which is,

594
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,120
something special thing, something very special,

595
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:26,120
and also as you know in music they use it

596
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,240
for some special composition, cheez.

597
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:40,070
But here the cheese is the most rotten milk

598
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,240
which no human beings or animals should eat.

599
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,070
Worms may, so they gave it to worms,

600
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:57,020
and I know in Holland and also in Sweden I think, yah,

601
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:02,230
they had cheese with worms

602
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,130
and they were eating the worms;

603
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,040
can you beat it, it is true;

604
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,240
not only the cheese but also the worms.

605
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,020
I mean see where we have ended up

606
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,240
into our acquisition instinct.

607
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,240
The wine has to be hundred year old, certified,

608
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,160
that's the best.

609
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:34,020
Such rotten things we are eating,

610
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,020
they smell, I tell you, they smell of it.

611
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:40,120
That's why, once I was surprised that,

612
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,160
they go to the bathroom, don't even wash their hands.

613
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,070
We get such horrible smells, they don't get

614
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,050
because if you take that cheese

615
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,210
you cannot smell anything rotten.

616
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,120
Even if you put them in the gutters

617
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,210
they won't feel anything rotten

618
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:59,020
because it's all that dirty smell, they are used to.

619
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,120
Is the filth, I mean even if they go to hell

620
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,050
they won't feel bad because the smell will be the same.

621
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,210
So where should we put them?

622
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,040
They are so immune to that dirty smell

623
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,230
which is absolutely sub-human.

624
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:29,120
So this acquisition instinct in any elite society

625
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,180
- once upon a time French society was regarded as elite

626
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:00,200
- so the most elite society was the French society

627
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,010
was most diplomatic in every way.

628
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:11,200
Their food was made with wine, everything was wine,

629
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:17,140
and this diplomatic society once upon… ruled the whole

630
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,220
diplomatic areas.

631
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,030
But they never realized

632
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:32,000
that the whole culture was nothing but eating and drinking.

633
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,080
Nothing else but eating and drinking.

634
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,110
And later on maybe little politics started.

635
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:47,220
But this eating and drinking

636
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:51,010
went to such a limit

637
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,230
that now they have gone out of diplomatic areas;

638
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:00,170
no one wants them because they never think in the right way.

639
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,090
Any diplomat, French diplomat is anywhere,

640
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:06,030
people say, “Is he French?” “Yes.”

641
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,080
“Then better not call him for this meeting,

642
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:13,140
you know, he'll put his own ideas.” They went out.

643
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:18,220
So now that eliteness is shifted in America.

644
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,060
So the most elite are taking to drugs.

645
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,010
What is it after all?

646
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:28,120
Drugs is creation of this acquisition instinct only.

647
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:34,180
Why should you blame Colombians or anybody else?

648
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:36,000
They are making their money, all right

649
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,200
as you are all making,

650
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,170
but the one they are feeding is America,

651
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:45,110
and America is the main thing now in acquisition instinct.

652
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,200
And what are they acquiring?

653
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,110
I have been in that society,

654
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:53,000
they only talk of drugs.

655
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,200
All right,

656
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,120
drugs they talk not only that

657
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,030
but it's like a shopping of drugs.

658
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,060
They all know where you get drugs,

659
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:06,080
all these so-called ambassadors and these people,

660
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,080
and their wives.

661
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:11,160
With all their dresses have become simpler now,

662
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:14,120
they do not dress up the way formerly

663
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:16,230
the ambassadors’ wives used to dress up.

664
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:21,190
I will not be surprised if they come in holey pants.

665
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
So this acquisition instinct you can see in the

666
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:31,050
elite society has ended up into drugs,

667
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,060
and if not, into gurus - false gurus.

668
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,110
Those who got fed up with this went to false gurus

669
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,110
because they have no discrimination

670
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:44,090
to know what is right and what is wrong.

671
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:51,080
See, step by step, how it has gone into the rotten state,

672
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,140
this ego, in the West.

673
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,010
So this is the first point,

674
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:02,020
is the acquisition instinct you have.

675
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:05,170
In that then somebody’s wife is good-looking,

676
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,160
then every man has a right to look at her.

677
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:13,160
Or some man is good-looking, maybe anybody’s husband

678
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,230
– every woman has right to look at him.

679
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:18,080
Not look at her own husband but another man,

680
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:20,000
what’s the use?

681
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,160
I’ve never been able to understand,

682
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,160
“What’s the use of looking at another man

683
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,010
who is not your husband?”

684
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:32,220
This acquisition instinct has gone

685
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:38,080
into complete immoral life, immoral society

686
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:46,190
and they have lost sense of respect of their age.

687
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:52,190
A ninety-year-old woman having a love affair

688
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,160
with a grandson who is eighteen-year-old;

689
00:46:55,230 --> 00:47:01,000
just think of that, such stupidity, such nonsense.

690
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:05,140
How is it possible unless and until

691
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:11,050
we have some sort of a perverted acquisition instinct?

692
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,140
Even art has gone into perversion,

693
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:17,200
everything has gone into perversion

694
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,170
- because the curse of the Western society is that

695
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,170
there is no maryada.

696
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:34,140
And Kundalini rises in its own maryada,

697
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,080
it brings back your maryadas,

698
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,190
it keeps you into your maryadas.

699
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,140
You are a human being,

700
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:45,140
don't live like animals, even worse than animals.

701
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:50,000
You have no right to do that.

702
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:53,220
God has not created you to be sub-human

703
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,170
but to be super-human being.

704
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:00,170
So, this is how it works out.

705
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:05,090
You can now think about it, how far it goes

706
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,170
this acquisition instinct,

707
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,090
about things.

708
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:16,190
But the second very bad curse

709
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:22,000
of the Western acquisition instinct is

710
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:27,030
that they want to acquire, aggress, others.

711
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,120
Aggression, the aggressiveness.

712
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:39,160
They think they have a right to aggress other countries,

713
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,050
I mean they aggressed our country for three hundred years.

714
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,200
Why? Why did they aggress? We are not bad people.

715
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:51,090
Because we had gold, we had diamonds,

716
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,030
we had pearls,

717
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,110
we had lots of things

718
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:01,080
which were just material things for which they aggressed us,

719
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,190
and they didn't take any spirituality from India.

720
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,110
So the French aggressed, these aggressed,

721
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,190
all the time aggressing.

722
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:11,200
Japanese are also following you.

723
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:17,110
This aggression then moves the whole society

724
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:21,010
into a very destructive force.

725
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,000
You can see every day the wars are going on,

726
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:27,010
this is fighting that, that is fighting that,

727
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,110
they want this, they want that.

728
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:32,120
And this aggression has also penetrated

729
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,060
the developing countries, the third world also.

730
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:39,160
So, nicely the disease is on.

731
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:49,050
But Kundalini kills that acquisition.

732
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:53,060
How? By giving you joy.

733
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:57,160
You enjoy everything.

734
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:01,030
You are sitting in a jungle, you are enjoying,

735
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,140
here in uncomfortable conditions, you enjoy

736
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:08,120
because you seek the comfort of your spirit,

737
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,230
because that gives you joy

738
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,110
- ultimately that's what you get out of everything.

739
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,200
You think you get joy by acquisition; you do not.

740
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,230
But through Kundalini awakening you get that joy,

741
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:27,140
and in that joy you don't want anything,

742
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,140
you don't ask for anything;

743
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,090
you just enjoy yourself;

744
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,110
you are the property of enjoyment.

745
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,230
Sanskrit they say,  “Atmanyeva atmane ahrushta”

746
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:44,140
- “The Spirit is satisfied by its own spirit.”

747
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,110
So into small things you must see joy,

748
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:58,090
and you must watch it, the whole universe, with that thing.

749
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:01,020
I mean when I am traveling I'll ask,

750
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,130
“What is this tree?”

751
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,210
“Mother, we don't know.”

752
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,190
“Well, you lived here for so many years, you don't know?”

753
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:07,210
“No Mother, we don't know much about trees.”

754
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,040
I say, “What are these flowers?”

755
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,120
“We don't know.”

756
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,070
I mean what are you doing, what have you been doing,

757
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:14,070
you don't know what are the trees,

758
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,210
every day you watch them;

759
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,120
you don't know what is the tree is?

760
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:24,060
But if you ask them, “Where do you get this wine?”

761
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,210
they will know.

762
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,030
“Mother, this is the place

763
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:29,020
where they produced the best wines.”

764
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:30,180
“All right, I'll see to it.”

765
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:34,110
And next year they had no fermentation.

766
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:43,240
So, this is the acquisition instinct which is very,

767
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,220
sort of a, which becomes a political asset

768
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,210
that you go and aggress other countries,

769
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:54,100
aggress other people and use all kinds of things;

770
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,140
and that really is killing.

771
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,070
So the whole attitude of human beings changes,

772
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:06,240
they think we are the Lord,

773
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,110
we can hate anyone,

774
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,020
we can aggress anyone,

775
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:11,190
we could be arrogant with anyone,

776
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:15,020
we can demand anything, we can take away anybody's wife,

777
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,240
take away anybody's child, take away anything,

778
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,000
we can kill our children.

779
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:26,130
As a result the love is lost;

780
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:29,210
no question of compassion.

781
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:33,160
Love is lost, compassion is lost; no love.

782
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:40,110
And with that you also developed “my” and “mine”,

783
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:42,130
sense of “my and mine”

784
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,040
- is that this is my child,

785
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,040
this is my country,

786
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,150
this is... As you know in Yugoslavia what they are doing.

787
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:58,240
I don't know who gave the name of Yugo, Yugo means Yoga.

788
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:03,110
This is the Yoga people, fighting among themselves.

789
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:08,160
This has come from the same root that,

790
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:10,150
“This is mine, this is my country”.

791
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:13,020
Why? How is it your country?

792
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,100
You can't create one leaf, so who are you?

793
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:20,240
You can't create little mud, can you?

794
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,090
How do you say, “This is my country?” How dare?

795
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,210
This all belongs to God.

796
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:32,150
He has created, or you can say Adi Shakti has created.

797
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,200
You have not created even so much;

798
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:39,070
how do you say, “This is mine and I should have it?”

799
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:44,230
So the “my” and “mine” thing also develops, very strong.

800
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:48,030
And the same thing happens with, sometimes, Sahaja Yogis,

801
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:53,070
very much. “My children”, this is the first curse.

802
00:53:55,070 --> 00:54:01,030
“These are my children, my wife, my family”,

803
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,040
it starts growing like that.

804
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:10,200
Then the heart shrinks.

805
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:15,210
For a large-hearted man the whole world is the universe,

806
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:19,150
the whole thing is within,

807
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:22,000
the whole thing is yours.

808
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:29,160
When such a heart you experience within yourself

809
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:31,240
then Kundalini just shoots off because,

810
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,230
as you know, the Sahasrara is the Heart Chakra.

811
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:38,190
No question of Sahasrara catching

812
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,120
if you have a large heart.

813
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,230
And to keep the Sahasrara open

814
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:50,020
- is just develop that sense, that wisdom,

815
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:53,100
that: "Nobody's mine, everybody belongs to God.

816
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,130
Who is mine?

817
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:59,160
Whatever God wants, let Him do."

818
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:03,150
So get out of this small feeling.

819
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:07,020
Sahaja Yogis do, I must say, I have seen it.

820
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,160
They get confined to their families.

821
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:14,020
“My son hasn't got Realization,

822
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,150
my brother hasn't got Realization, my this thing.”

823
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:21,040
After that it moves, when they get Realization,

824
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:24,040
“This is my son, my brother, my sister, this thing.”

825
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,020
This “my” has to drop, which is very, very subtle thing,

826
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:30,160
and that's why the Sahasrara catches.

827
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:34,040
Everyone is yours

828
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:44,230
because the Kundalini of Sahaja Yogis is made of love,

829
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,090
pure love.

830
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:53,010
The pure love has only pure desire, is to love,

831
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:56,180
love everyone equally.

832
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,180
When you say it is difficult

833
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:02,010
that means you are not trying Sahaja Yoga.

834
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:04,180
Enlarge your heart;

835
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,210
you'll never feel lost.

836
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:11,200
To Me, when I was leaving England I was really, little bit,

837
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:16,040
I mean happens like that, like a moon sucks in the sea,

838
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:20,070
you see, I felt My heart was just pulled out,

839
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:26,040
but I reach here, again I see My children waiting for Me,

840
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,180
so it's over, finished.

841
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:33,180
It's there I felt, now here I feel

842
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:40,060
that pull of My heart was released.

843
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:46,040
You are also My children here and they are also My children.

844
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:48,180
For a Mother like this, how can I say,

845
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:51,150
“Oh, say this is Mine, this is Mine?”

846
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:58,180
So like this, try to break away from this conditioning.

847
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:01,180
First, in the West people don't care for family;

848
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,150
they'll divorce ten times and advertise it,

849
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:07,070
“I am tenth time divorced lady."

850
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:11,180
Now they don't divorce but so get attached

851
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:15,170
with their family, with their husbands;

852
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:18,090
like glue I tell you, like glue.

853
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:20,180
Sometimes I start wondering,

854
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:24,040
“What have I done to make them like this?”

855
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:29,090
So now it is important to see these points,

856
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:34,210
and ultimately the heart is the Sahasrara,

857
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:36,230
or you can call the Brahmarandra,

858
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:40,100
then we have to come to heart.

859
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:44,100
Do not reason out, do not argue it out,

860
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:49,060
don't work it out mentally from books or anywhere,

861
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,010
but through your heart,

862
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,100
if you work it out,

863
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:56,140
you'll understand that nothing is more important

864
00:57:57,090 --> 00:58:00,030
than to love someone.

865
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:06,170
And the highest thing is to love everyone equally.

866
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:10,090
Of course in love you might have to say something

867
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,070
to a person.

868
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,230
The other day I had to say something to some Sahaja Yogini,

869
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:17,020
so My husband said,

870
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:18,230
“Don't say, she'll become Your enemy.”

871
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:20,210
I said, “Let her become My enemy, it doesn't matter.

872
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:24,040
It's My duty to tell her that this is wrong,

873
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:28,010
otherwise I become her enemy because I don't… told her

874
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,130
the truth and she will suffer.”

875
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:37,130
So this is what it gives you discretion;

876
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:41,070
and love is truth.

877
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:45,020
So to this Kundalini,

878
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:51,080
which is nothing but, is the river,

879
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,080
as yesterday they described nirvaj,

880
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:59,190
which doesn't accept any compensation.

881
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:03,210
The river of that pure love

882
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,100
which has awakened us with such love,

883
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,130
kindness and tenderness,

884
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:14,050
we should try to use that power within ourselves

885
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:17,160
to be like that because our job is,

886
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,070
She has given us Realization

887
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:23,210
for the emancipation of the whole world,

888
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,100
not only our own.

889
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:29,100
So everyone has to give Realization to others

890
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:32,130
otherwise their Kundalini will settle back.

891
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,140
Talk about Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is not part time,

892
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:41,130
it is not a side issue, it should be always with you.

893
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,110
Wherever you get a chance you have to talk

894
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,120
about Sahaja Yoga, you have to work it out,

895
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:49,170
you have to give Realization, otherwise no use.

896
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:53,090
May God bless you all.
