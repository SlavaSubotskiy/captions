1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:14,868
Face yourself for becoming.

2
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:33,000
Then the preparation is done
to become something and on the whole, when

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
you know that it is your ego and superego
which are loading you up, you have to scan

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,593
them out with vibratory awareness.

5
00:00:49,827 --> 00:01:03,587
Now there are two types of attention we have
to pay.

6
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:12,579
First is a constant attention that is a routine
of a Sahaja Yogi, and the second one is the

7
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:19,270
emergency attention.

8
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:27,939
I have been saying that all the Sahaja Yogis
must start writing their diaries: one with

9
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:34,680
every day’s experiences, if you know that
you have to write a diary, you’ll keep your

10
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:44,889
mind alert, and another one whenever you get
any special idea of the past or of the future,

11
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:45,889
also to jot it down.

12
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:48,250
So, like that, you should have two diaries.

13
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:54,259
For your constant attention, you have to fix
up your mind on certain facts.

14
00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:03,523
The first one, as I said, that if you keep
a diary then you will know that you have to

15
00:02:03,548 --> 00:02:06,498
remember what important things have happened.

16
00:02:06,523 --> 00:02:12,510
So your attention will be alert and you will
be looking out for such points, where, what

17
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,619
is the thing you see.

18
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:22,528
And you’ll be amazed, if you make your attention
alert, what new things come to you – very

19
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:26,400
brilliant ideas.

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,290
And the miracles of life and the miracles
of God’s beauty and His auspiciousness,

21
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,989
His greatness, His kindness, His blessings
– how they work out if you start writing

22
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:41,840
every day even two lines about it.

23
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,090
It will make your mind constantly involved
with it.

24
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,140
That’s a human style of doing things.

25
00:02:50,140 --> 00:03:01,750
Also you can mention in the diary what happened:
did you, could you do your meditation?

26
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,750
Did you get your time for meditation or not?

27
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:12,650
A little bit as if you are appearing for some
sort of a examination or something, you prepare

28
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,997
a little note like that: “Did I get up in
the morning?

29
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:17,997
Did I?”

30
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:27,970
Then any special path or any special movement
in the centre or left or right also should

31
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,849
be mentioned so that you keep a watch on your
mind.

32
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,010
It’s a very good thing to maintain a diary.

33
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:41,390
Also, you will see progressively how your
ideas are changing, how new priorities are

34
00:03:41,415 --> 00:03:49,817
settling down, how you give more importance
to real things and very little to unreal things.

35
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:57,799
I think this is a very, very practical side
of human beings that one should have a diary.

36
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:04,159
[The] same diaries, after some times, will
become historical things and people would

37
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,939
like to see what you all have written.

38
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:16,609
Not to be hypocritical about it or deceptive
about it, but quite truthful and understanding.

39
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:24,431
You should jot down few lines just before
sleeping.

40
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:31,640
Now we have to see that we have problems for
superego and ego.

41
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:40,310
Now superego is the left side, is darkness,
tamo guna and our past.

42
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:47,699
Those who have left side problems should think
of the future, it gives them balancing if

43
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,990
they think of the future.

44
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:59,415
For example, a person who is lethargic should
take to working.

45
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,220
Put your mind into working for the future
planning: what to do, where to go, how to

46
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,220
do.

47
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:16,660
That will keep you away from [the] drag of
the left side and gradually then you can balance

48
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,130
yourself also.

49
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:36,800
Now the right side of a person, when it is
activated very much, he has to balance it

50
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,366
not with the left side but with the centre.

51
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:55,662
That is, a person who is very hard-working
must develop a witness state.

52
00:05:55,687 --> 00:06:06,789
You try to do a work, any work, indulge into
work in thoughtless awareness, as a witness.

53
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:14,020
Whatever work you are doing you just say that:
“I am not doing it."

54
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,830
This you can do it after Realisation.

55
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,770
You become thoughtlessly aware and start doing
your work.

56
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:27,949
So the compensation of the left side is done
by movement to the right, and of the right

57
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:30,180
side [by] movement in the centre.

58
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,490
Left side is the tamo guna, right side is
the rajo guna, the centre is the sattwo guna.

59
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,020
But still these are three gunas.

60
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,000
That’s not the state which we have to achieve.

61
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,460
About this I’ll tell you tomorrow more,
how to go further then.

62
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:53,949
After scanning out which side is weak, you
should plan out your style of life.

63
00:06:53,949 --> 00:07:00,470
For example, if you are extremely lethargic,
you cannot get up in the morning, you feel

64
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:05,900
very sleepy in the night, you do not feel
alerted then start planning as to what will

65
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,900
you do.

66
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,289
How will you get up?

67
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,613
Even puja is a good idea, homa (havan) is
a good idea.

68
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:15,472
Do something like that, so that you have to
do something, what you call the kriya, is

69
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:18,300
the action, get into the action.

70
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:25,400
Some sort of a action you go into in Sahaja
Yoga as well as in your daily life [then]

71
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,449
you’ll be able to change that mood and come
to the right side and then you’ll go to

72
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:38,548
the, your movement should be towards the sattwa
guna, is to watch everything.

73
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:48,639
Now at the sattwa guna point where you are
in the centre you have to see how much you

74
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,540
are misidentified.

75
00:07:51,540 --> 00:08:00,880
Say, supposing you are at the first stage
of left side, then you will just do daydreaming,

76
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
“‘Oh!

77
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,050
This person is so much identified, that one
is so much identified,” as if you are the

78
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,050
best.

79
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,880
It’s just human nature, you see.

80
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,590
“Oh, that person is like that, he is like
that, this is very bad in the society, that

81
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,990
is going bad in the society.

82
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,990
It’s better…”

83
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:20,039
Then we can also go to this limit is to, “That
guru is very bad and that one is another madcap."

84
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,949
Like that, you see, all daydreaming going
on.

85
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:26,780
How far it is affecting you, how far are you
improving by that is not….It’s just, you

86
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,230
see, thinking, analysing.

87
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:34,160
It is, it’s a lazy stuff, sitting down and
just analysing, it’s a lazy stuff.

88
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:41,120
The second thing could be when you come to
the second side of it, is the kriya.

89
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,870
Then what happens when you start doing it,
then at least your attention is on what you

90
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,870
are doing.

91
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,580
It’s not allowed to drift into something
and which goes into any nonsense and can,

92
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,940
I mean, then you don’t know from where the
funny thoughts are coming.

93
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,420
So, you start doing something.

94
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,440
You can go and plant some trees or you can
go and plant some flowers or if you want you

95
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,690
can do some cooking, you can do some work.

96
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,529
Take to work!

97
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:09,600
That will help you.

98
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Any work.

99
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,556
But while doing the work the problem will
be, you’ll develop ego.

100
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:20,850
That’s why when you are developing the ego
you have to tell yourself, “You are not

101
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,850
doing, mister!

102
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,690
This you are not doing, this is not doing,
you are not doing."

103
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,769
If you go on suggesting to yourself [like
this] Mr.

104
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:29,550
Ego will not come up.

105
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,390
And then many things, you see, which normally
trouble you and trouble others – like you

106
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,260
have cleaned the room, alright.

107
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,490
Then [if] somebody comes and spoils it you
get angry with that person.

108
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,600
Naturally!

109
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,623
Because you think ‘you’ have done.

110
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,551
First of all you don’t clean the room.

111
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:47,828
If you clean the room then you be prepared,
it will be dirtied, otherwise why should you

112
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:48,853
clean?

113
00:09:50,818 --> 00:09:56,760
Now, if it is dirty, well and good; if it
is not dirtied, well and good.

114
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,700
This type of a attitude you should take to
jump on to sattwa guna.

115
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,350
On sattwa guna you start accepting it.

116
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,200
You become extremely mild.

117
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,570
You become a mild personality.

118
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:17,370
Then at that time you do not discuss as to,
“Oh, I don’t like it; this was wrong;

119
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,490
this should not have been."

120
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,040
All these things do not come to you in sattwa
guna.

121
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,070
You start seeing it.

122
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,670
That time you see it that, “Alright, doesn’t
matter.

123
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,790
It’s done, it’s done."

124
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:34,950
On the contrary, you feel hurt if you are
a sattwa guni, that by any suggestion you

125
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,840
have suggested your ego.

126
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,070
Can you get that point?

127
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,180
You feel ashamed of your ego, I mean to say,
if you are a sattwa guni.

128
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,529
For example, even to say that “This is my
car,” you will feel shy.

129
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:50,133
That’s a sattwa guni type.

130
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,827
Or even to say, “Why did you spoil my carpet?”

131
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,205
I mean in India nobody will say, I can tell
you this!

132
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,977
Is regarded [as] bad manners, absolute bad
manners.

133
00:10:58,002 --> 00:11:00,452
If anybody comes to your house and the carpet
is spoiled they say, “Let it be, doesn’t

134
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,161
matter."

135
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:02,452
Even it is burnt, “I don’t know.

136
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:02,974
Let it be.

137
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:03,974
Are you burnt?”

138
00:11:04,452 --> 00:11:08,580
They’ll never say that, “You have burnt
my carpet, or done anything to my…”

139
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,510
Is regarded [as] bad manners.

140
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:16,260
Like here, you see, if somebody’s sleeping
[and] somebody makes the noise.

141
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,219
The person who is sleeping will never say
that “You are making noise,” He’ll just

142
00:11:21,244 --> 00:11:24,172
get up and ask, “Do you need anything?”

143
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:30,590
That’s difficult for people here to understand
because ego is just sitting on the head.

144
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,110
But is bad manners there.

145
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,561
You will find when you’ll go to India you’ll
find this.

146
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,320
These are bad manners to say that.

147
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,310
Or to say, “Oh, I, I feel very comfortable."

148
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,490
I mean, to say “I feel comfortable” is
bad manners.

149
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,800
I mean, they never say.

150
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,180
“I like it."

151
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,180
So what?

152
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,250
All these words are not to be said.

153
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:56,620
If you are a sattwa guni then you just don’t
say, you will say, “Do you like it?

154
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,760
Is it comfortable?

155
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,060
Would you like to have this?”

156
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,570
The whole attention goes from your side.

157
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,623
Do you understand that?

158
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,320
That is the style one has to develop.

159
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,079
Then you are a sattwa guni.

160
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,190
Otherwise, you are still on ego trip.

161
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,605
You see, whatever you may think, “I don’t
like that, I don’t…”

162
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,591
“I”- who are you?

163
00:12:21,136 --> 00:12:23,730
First of all ask the question, “Who are
you?”

164
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,880
If God says, “I don’t like you,” I can
understand, with good reasons, but for you

165
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:36,943
to say, “I don’t like it” …After all,
how did you come on this earth?

166
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:39,540
How did you get a human birth?

167
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,810
How did you get all these things?

168
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,490
Now think like that.

169
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:46,796
“Who am I?

170
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,820
I am nothing."

171
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:57,500
Anybody who thinks, “I am something,”
he should know that he’s nothing; makes

172
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,236
no difference to God whether he exists or
does not exist, you see, he’s nothing, he’s

173
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:02,402
just a drop.

174
00:13:04,593 --> 00:13:11,940
So, this point if you understand, that even
if you do something, any work you do or anything

175
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,610
you are doing: you are just doing it because
you want to do it.

176
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,620
That is how you come on to sattwa guna.

177
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,399
But normally it doesn’t happen.

178
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,949
It happens the other way round.

179
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:37,735
For example a person is, say, doing something
[if] by any chance he feels hurt or he thinks

180
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,917
that whatever he has done is no good.

181
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:44,490
People don’t appreciate, or maybe he might
think that, “Oh, it’s not up to the point,”

182
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:50,980
or whatever it is, then the reaction for him
is not that he does not try to rise to sattwa

183
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,155
guna, but he goes back to tamo guna.

184
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,210
“Alright, I’ll not do it.

185
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,245
I’ll sleep over it.

186
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,160
Let them do it, why should I do it?”

187
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,470
So the training that you have to have through
your rajo guna goes a waste.

188
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:12,209
It’s just a training period that you are
with rajo guna.

189
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:13,812
You are doing something.

190
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:20,579
Now in that training period you have to learn
only how to come in the centre.

191
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:24,803
For example now, water is required for you
to swim.

192
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:27,605
If there is no water you cannot swim.

193
00:14:28,303 --> 00:14:29,303
All right?

194
00:14:29,383 --> 00:14:35,370
In the same way, rajo guna is required for
you to come to sattwa guni.

195
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:38,529
If you do not do any work you cannot come
to sattwa guna.

196
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:45,320
So you are just working just to train yourself
to be a witness.

197
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,850
Now do you follow that point?

198
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:51,839
You are not doing it because you like particular
thing, you are used to particular thing, because

199
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,137
you want to be this.

200
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:55,978
This is not the way it is.

201
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:01,740
You are just doing it to learn how to be patient.

202
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,300
To practice your patience.

203
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,965
To see how much patient you are.

204
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,358
Once you start doing it, you’ll be amazed
that you will never feel the burden of the

205
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,403
work.

206
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,415
But it never happens.

207
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,312
Most of the people, if they find their work
is not effective, they’ll go back to tamo

208
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:24,113
guna.

209
00:15:25,146 --> 00:15:26,795
There are many attitudes.

210
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,570
Say, somebody’s working, then he thinks,
“Why should I do all the work?

211
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,650
Others are not doing!”

212
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,370
He’ll go back to their stage.

213
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:37,298
But those who are not working will not think
that, “This person is working, let me also

214
00:15:37,323 --> 00:15:38,323
work."

215
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,602
It’s other way round, you see.

216
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:49,766
This can be an attitude of some people that
“if this person is working, let him work."

217
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:53,843
This is even a meaner stuff, [to] avoid, just.

218
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:58,133
You go to a restaurant and somebody takes
out the purse, others start looking this side

219
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:01,647
– is very mean, it’s a very mean thing
to do.

220
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:07,208
Everybody should come forward and once you
have paid, you have paid it, finished.

221
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:10,788
Then you just don’t start counting, “Why
did I pay?”

222
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:13,481
Once you try [to do this].

223
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:18,922
Or any work has to be done, go forward with
it, do it with your heart.

224
00:16:19,064 --> 00:16:21,636
Don’t worry if others have not done it.

225
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:28,003
Just do it for its pleasure and the pleasure
only you will get when you will do it with

226
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,100
the understanding that it’s a training period,
you are better trained than the other one

227
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,100
is.

228
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:36,875
You are at a higher class than the other one
is.

229
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,821
So we have to be at a higher class.

230
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:44,280
For that this is just a training on.

231
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:53,170
And that’s how we can really put our preparation
into practice, into all details to see how

232
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:56,311
we work out our ego and superego.

233
00:16:56,383 --> 00:17:03,618
Today, in the morning, I have told you that
your intellect must imbibe this within itself,

234
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:05,034
all right?

235
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:18,058
And now I’m telling you that your action,
action that you do, must be every time branded

236
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:26,739
by you as just your training – any action
you do.

237
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:32,059
Supposing you have to drive for miles together,
you are trying your patience.

238
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:33,671
You see they’ll do in everything.

239
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:39,390
Say they have to go for say helicopter, or
say if they have to drop from the…what you

240
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:41,441
call them, they drop down?

241
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:43,349
Sahaja Yogis: Parachutes.

242
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:44,722
Shri Mataji: Parachuters!

243
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:48,436
Or helicopter you take away or whatever it
is.

244
00:17:48,523 --> 00:17:51,405
You go on doing it again and again, isn’t
it?

245
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:53,273
You practice it again and again.

246
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:57,424
You drop many-a-times, you break your legs,
you break your hands, you do this and do that

247
00:17:57,449 --> 00:17:59,838
till you become a master.

248
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:01,014
You understand My point?

249
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,425
Driving – same way, till you become a master,
you go on.

250
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,229
In the same way, you are doing this work just
to master your patience.

251
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:16,830
And then your love, is your love – how much
you love really.

252
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:21,122
If you really love someone, you are never
tired of working.

253
00:18:24,623 --> 00:18:27,186
You are never upset with work.

254
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:32,137
But if you don’t love, you start counting,
“How much money, how much work, how many

255
00:18:32,162 --> 00:18:35,342
hours, how much to be paid?”

256
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:41,023
All artificiality comes because there is no
love involved in your work.

257
00:18:41,316 --> 00:18:47,433
Whatever you don’t want to do, you don’t
do it, to begin with.

258
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:52,648
To begin with you just don’t do what you
don’t like – to begin with.

259
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:58,591
But once you have mastered that, then you
have to master it that you do something that

260
00:18:58,616 --> 00:19:00,772
you don’t like.

261
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,098
Like meeting some bhooties, for example.

262
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:11,028
You don’t want to meet, you want to run
away, but you go little nearer it, you see.

263
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:13,496
Then develop a immunity for these bhooties.

264
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:15,465
After some time you’ll not catch them.

265
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:19,862
We have to develop the immunity, isn’t it?

266
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:24,357
Otherwise one person comes here and everybody’s
head goes out.

267
00:19:25,508 --> 00:19:29,242
Instead of the fellow improving, you all go
out.

268
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:36,114
So all these things are, all these events
are for your training, your immunity.

269
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:44,827
Your immunity is to be trained and when it
is so, when we are training ourselves we should

270
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,632
take it as a job.

271
00:19:49,103 --> 00:20:00,797
But the attitude should be extremely positive,
extremely positive and all that should be

272
00:20:00,822 --> 00:20:09,043
expressed in your notebook: whether you got
dejected or you got upset and disgusted, you

273
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:12,101
want to run away from it – all sorts of
things.

274
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:15,622
It’s just a training to your mind.

275
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:25,960
Whatever is the situation, wherever one has
to live, whatever one has to do, we should

276
00:20:25,985 --> 00:20:27,003
do.

277
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:35,430
Whatever may be the circumstances, conditions,
you’ll be amazed, you will not even know

278
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:39,117
what you have eaten in the morning, what you
have eaten in the evening, whether you have

279
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:41,095
eaten or not you will not know.

280
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:47,768
You’ll not fuss about it, you’ll not worry
about it, you’ll not think about it.

281
00:20:50,149 --> 00:21:01,297
But this being, the aim, is to reach to sattwa
guna, every other thing becomes zero.

282
00:21:03,924 --> 00:21:10,149
It’s the greatest hurdle comes to Sahaja
Yogis I’ve seen, when they start organising.

283
00:21:10,851 --> 00:21:13,401
They start organising something.

284
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:19,026
Now somebody wants something, so they’ll
run up to get the thing for that person.

285
00:21:19,051 --> 00:21:24,463
Now just now I’ve said that you must look
after the needs of others, but if I am sitting

286
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:28,614
here and there’s a lecture on then you’d
better be just listening to Me.

287
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:34,843
You see, this also is there that: how to have
your priorities, at this time when something

288
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,215
[is] working on you.

289
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:39,827
This is the first thing you have to do.

290
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:44,115
Not that at this time you go and cook.

291
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:50,033
You have known the story of two sisters attending
on Christ.

292
00:21:50,398 --> 00:21:51,398
Alright?

293
00:21:51,423 --> 00:22:02,787
So at this time, what is your first job is
to try to be more exposed to Me so that automatically

294
00:22:02,812 --> 00:22:04,430
you’ll go into your sattwa guna.

295
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:05,657
This is the best!

296
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:14,439
But if I am not there and when you are alone
or when you are with other Sahaja Yogis you

297
00:22:14,464 --> 00:22:21,354
must now compete in rising higher and higher:
from tamo guna to rajo guna and from rajo

298
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:23,060
guna to sattwo guna.

299
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:28,228
But actually by Realisation you have gone
beyond these three gunas.

300
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:31,046
You have gone beyond it.

301
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,176
Actually that is what has happened to you.

302
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:39,737
But, like clouds, they cover you again and
again.

303
00:22:40,554 --> 00:22:47,399
And when the sky is covered with those clouds,
you cannot see the sun, you cannot see the

304
00:22:47,424 --> 00:22:50,070
moon, you cannot see the stars.

305
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:56,949
So we have to know how these clouds are coming
into us and that’s how we go into our complete

306
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:57,986
analysis.

307
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:03,763
How these clouds are coming to us, you find
out about our different chakras.

308
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,840
What are the chakras we are catching?

309
00:23:08,506 --> 00:23:14,531
Here comes the another constant attention
towards our chakras.

310
00:23:15,448 --> 00:23:17,322
Are our vibrations alright or not?

311
00:23:17,974 --> 00:23:20,396
Are we getting our vibrations?

312
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:25,536
If not, what chakra am I catching, what must
be the catch?

313
00:23:25,592 --> 00:23:29,793
I must raise my Kundalini, see for myself,
where is the catch.

314
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:32,284
Do I do my meditation or not?

315
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:36,692
If I do it, am I doing it just dozingly or
am I really in it?

316
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:40,095
Am I really feeling it or not?

317
00:23:40,141 --> 00:23:41,652
Am I alert or not?

318
00:23:41,677 --> 00:23:49,333
All this is to be assiduously, sincerely,
absolutely, truthfully should be worked out.

319
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:55,060
Because it is a process between your self
– ‘Atamanyeva Atmana tushta’ [The Spirit

320
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:57,228
is satisfied with Itself].

321
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:07,186
You see it’s a very funny, it is so funny
relationship that it is the Atma is satisfied

322
00:24:07,211 --> 00:24:08,400
with Atma!

323
00:24:09,123 --> 00:24:11,454
You have to be satisfied with your Self.

324
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:15,348
There’s nobody, Mataji is not concerned,
nobody is concerned.

325
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:19,517
It is you who is concerned with your Self.

326
00:24:20,398 --> 00:24:24,861
For example, you ask somebody and he says,
“I am like this, Mother."

327
00:24:25,504 --> 00:24:31,768
Now think that you are Mother, one personality,
another is, say, Mr.

328
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:35,354
Don or Kingsley or someone X.

329
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:37,834
You are two personalities.

330
00:24:37,945 --> 00:24:44,157
So when you are telling your Self, means that
is Mataji, that, “I am not alright,” then

331
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,087
Mataji must come up and say, “What do you
mean by this?

332
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:49,085
Why should you say like that?

333
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,605
What’s wrong?”

334
00:24:53,054 --> 00:25:06,662
When you say that to your self which is outside,
then the attention starts moving towards your

335
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:15,476
Self which is Mataji and you start becoming
that and you start seeing through your Atma.

336
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:19,645
So your Atma is to be satisfied by your Atma
only.

337
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,024
There is nothing in between.

338
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:26,404
It is you only in this dual personality has
to satisfy your Self.

339
00:25:27,023 --> 00:25:30,286
One is in ignorance, one is in knowledge.

340
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:37,092
Now try to identify yourself with that Mataji,
call it, or any Xyz whatever you call it,

341
00:25:37,117 --> 00:25:38,078
Atma.

342
00:25:38,117 --> 00:25:41,351
And just for, just a drama, say.

343
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:45,899
You just think that you are the Self, Spirit.

344
00:25:47,098 --> 00:25:49,778
So how will you address your Self?

345
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:51,277
Let’s see.

346
00:25:51,302 --> 00:25:54,652
Supposing you have to sit in My seat, yes,
take it like that, a position.

347
00:25:54,652 --> 00:25:59,142
And then you are sitting in front of Me also,
alright?

348
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,149
So you are sitting here and sitting there.

349
00:26:01,174 --> 00:26:02,557
Take a position like that.

350
00:26:02,582 --> 00:26:08,755
Now you put up your Self in a drama and you
start addressing your self, “So Bala, how

351
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,937
are you?”

352
00:26:09,962 --> 00:26:20,543
so Bala says, “Better,”
So if you are identified now with Mataji,

353
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:24,416
gradually Bala will diminish, alright?

354
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:31,412
But if you are still identified with Bala,
he’ll grow and this [Mataji] will diminish.

355
00:26:31,629 --> 00:26:37,069
You have to try to address your self as if
you are Mataji.

356
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:42,899
It’s a drama.

357
00:26:42,924 --> 00:26:47,869
You sit before the mirror.

358
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:54,433
In the mirror you see this outside of yours
and here you are sitting, whatever you are,

359
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:55,653
Mr. Don for example.

360
00:26:55,678 --> 00:26:56,678
Now Mr.

361
00:26:56,703 --> 00:27:02,731
Don is addressing the other Don there, and
let him take up a role that, “I am the Spirit."

362
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:05,556
He’ll say, “I am the Spirit and I am eternal.

363
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:06,929
I am this.

364
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,277
Nobody can destroy me.

365
00:27:09,302 --> 00:27:11,119
I am above everything."

366
00:27:11,144 --> 00:27:12,924
That thing will go down.

367
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:16,873
“I am a realised soul.

368
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:18,223
I know what Spirit is.

369
00:27:18,248 --> 00:27:20,131
What are you talking?”

370
00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:21,782
It will go down.

371
00:27:24,863 --> 00:27:28,973
This is how you start moving.

372
00:27:30,562 --> 00:27:34,389
But is only possible that first you become
a sattwa guni.

373
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:40,960
If you are not a sattwa guni, with ego, “I
am this,” then you become a guru and you

374
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:42,914
start minting money!

375
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:46,243
First the ego is to be brought down.

376
00:27:46,268 --> 00:27:51,789
If there is still ego, then without becoming
Atma you become an ego.

377
00:27:51,814 --> 00:27:56,214
So first this journey should be brought in
to the centre of sattwa guna.

378
00:27:56,239 --> 00:28:07,431
That is why I say that when you are talking
or doing anything, you must know that it is

379
00:28:07,456 --> 00:28:09,591
your Spirit which is doing it.

380
00:28:09,616 --> 00:28:19,826
That’s how you put your Spirit in charge
or say at the pedestal – first stage.

381
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:24,853
Then when the Spirit is there, then from this
stage to that stage, then you say that, “Now

382
00:28:24,878 --> 00:28:27,008
I am the Spirit."

383
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:33,899
For example, if you have a prime minister
and a deputy minister and a minister – three

384
00:28:33,924 --> 00:28:34,924
persons, alright?

385
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:44,425
Now, if the prime minister is your Self and
the minister has to become the prime minister,

386
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:48,012
so he has to first become deputy minister.

387
00:28:48,037 --> 00:28:54,202
After becoming deputy minister he has to become
prime minister; but deputy prime minister

388
00:28:54,227 --> 00:28:55,400
and then the prime minister.

389
00:28:55,425 --> 00:29:00,793
But supposing this fellow starts to jump over
this, this will come up and hit him and he’ll

390
00:29:00,818 --> 00:29:04,819
say, “I’m the one!” and this one is
E-G-O.

391
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,775
Do you understand My point?

392
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:10,945
So you cannot surpass it.

393
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:16,284
You have to merge this into this and then
this into this.

394
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:18,695
The movement has to be like that.

395
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,009
But if you try to just become this, actually
you will become this, not this, because you

396
00:29:24,034 --> 00:29:26,232
cannot become this.

397
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:28,545
Do you understand My point?

398
00:29:28,545 --> 00:29:38,415
So, even when doing this exercise of sitting
before a mirror and telling yourself that

399
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:53,095
you are the Spirit, you are the part of Viraat,
that you are the Ocean because your drop has

400
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:56,515
fallen into the Ocean.

401
00:29:56,515 --> 00:30:00,783
Then you must know that your drop has fallen
into the Ocean.

402
00:30:00,808 --> 00:30:02,428
That’s why you’ve become an Ocean.

403
00:30:02,453 --> 00:30:08,371
If that stage is missing, then you’re saying
that you are an Ocean is absolutely bombastic.

404
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:18,168
And that is why one has to be very steady
and careful, absolutely steady as far as dealing

405
00:30:18,168 --> 00:30:19,168
with oneself.

406
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:22,600
Because you know how this intelligence can
cheat you.

407
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:29,248
So be very, very careful and when you are
dealing with you, you must know that you have

408
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:31,444
to first overcome this ego.

409
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:36,815
The best thing to overcome ego is to change
your language style, is to speak in the third

410
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,840
person.

411
00:30:37,865 --> 00:30:40,185
Is a very good way.

412
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:44,262
Like you must say, when you are talking about
yourself, “This Mataji won’t listen to

413
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:45,287
Me.

414
00:30:47,783 --> 00:30:51,961
This Mataji won’t do this,” you see, so
what happens, this ‘Mataji’ means the

415
00:30:51,986 --> 00:30:54,153
ego part of it, you see.

416
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:59,980
And once you start separating this Mataji
away from your self, then that ego Mataji

417
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:01,005
disappears.

418
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:02,451
You understand?

419
00:31:02,476 --> 00:31:05,770
Like you can say, “This Bala is like that.

420
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:07,254
He won’t listen."

421
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,484
So whatever the real Bala is left in you is
alright.

422
00:31:11,988 --> 00:31:18,607
That’s how you get rid of your ego and by
understanding your centres, what you are catching,

423
00:31:18,653 --> 00:31:26,824
where you are catching, how you are catching;
it would be very easy for you to get rid of

424
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:28,765
your problems.

425
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,810
Now, see what Sahaja Yogis do.

426
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:34,146
Supposing there are five Sahaja Yogis sitting.

427
00:31:34,194 --> 00:31:37,002
I mean you know that
I know about everyone, everything.

428
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:41,379
I don’t have to ask, “Where is catching?”

429
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:43,306
Now why do I ask?

430
00:31:43,331 --> 00:31:46,052
I show complete ignorance.

431
00:31:46,077 --> 00:31:49,086
Because perhaps I never catch also, to be
very frank.

432
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:53,749
But if I want to know where I’m catching
I can find out but I don’t want to.

433
00:31:53,774 --> 00:31:58,159
So what I say, “Alright, Chaya, tell Me
where is he catching."

434
00:31:58,213 --> 00:32:04,110
At this time one attitude could be that, “I
must tell, otherwise Mataji won’t know."

435
00:32:04,135 --> 00:32:05,396
This is very funny.

436
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:16,783
(Laughter) The second one could be, and the
second one could be that, that, “I know

437
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:26,453
where she is catching and, and I must tell,
and Mataji also knows but She wants to test

438
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
me.

439
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,600
So I should be careful."

440
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,446
At this point people make mistakes.

441
00:32:33,548 --> 00:32:38,205
If I ask them, “Where is it catching?”

442
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:40,827
“I am catching on left heart but very mildly!”

443
00:32:40,852 --> 00:32:41,641
Finished then!

444
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,158
You, you’ll get less marks.

445
00:32:46,426 --> 00:32:47,426
[Laughter]

446
00:32:50,108 --> 00:32:51,108
You get less marks.

447
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:58,452
You tell Me whatever you think, because at
least you’re honest.

448
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,668
Whatever you think.

449
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:03,254
Supposing the fellow is not catching heart
but you are feeling the heart.

450
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,024
You say, “Heart” That’s being honest.

451
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:09,613
Then I will tell you who is catching the heart.

452
00:33:09,664 --> 00:33:13,607
But if you are, “Perhaps yes, Mataji.

453
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,661
No, Mataji,” then you get less marks.

454
00:33:16,686 --> 00:33:20,561
It’s not a very good answer.

455
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:24,105
“I am not alright, I don’t know,” that’s
not a good answer.

456
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,840
You have to tell Me who is catching where.

457
00:33:28,865 --> 00:33:32,388
Then you pay more attention that you have
to pass this test.

458
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:34,725
This is just testing.

459
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,750
Why?

460
00:33:35,775 --> 00:33:38,450
Because tomorrow you have to give Realisation.

461
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,925
You have to become the gurus.

462
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,930
You have to know all this.

463
00:33:43,956 --> 00:33:46,946
So this is all training period.

464
00:33:46,946 --> 00:33:51,751
I’m just training you by asking you to tell
Me, but I have seen people even getting ego

465
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:52,544
with this.

466
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:54,844
It’s surprisingly sometimes.

467
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:59,687
That also gives the ego to people that I say,
“Alright, you tell Me where is he catching?”

468
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:01,484
“I told correctly!”

469
00:34:01,484 --> 00:34:02,484
Finished!

470
00:34:02,484 --> 00:34:12,503
You see, it is just a very, very, I can say,
razor stage I tell you, where one has to see

471
00:34:12,535 --> 00:34:13,535
clearly.

472
00:34:13,535 --> 00:34:15,724
So be a simple person like children are.

473
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:17,474
They just come.

474
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:19,527
This one, that one, finished.

475
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:23,324
Then they’ll go and sit down, “Now I’m
tired , I’m sitting down!”

476
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:30,477
They are not bothered that they should … they
must say something or something show off,

477
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:31,502
nothing.

478
00:34:31,556 --> 00:34:34,156
Whatever they see, they say.

479
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:40,060
But only grownups will say that, “Maybe
I’m catching, maybe it is his.

480
00:34:40,085 --> 00:34:41,520
I don’t know."

481
00:34:41,576 --> 00:34:49,310
All this is done by grownup people because
still the sensitivity is alright but they

482
00:34:49,335 --> 00:34:51,437
are not sure of themselves.

483
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:52,873
Children are very sure.

484
00:34:52,898 --> 00:34:55,397
They are cocksure of everything.

485
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,351
You ask them anything, they’ll tell you,
“Yes, this is this, this is this."

486
00:34:58,376 --> 00:35:03,296
But you ask anyone, “What is the colour
of this thing?”

487
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:05,881
They’ll say, “Maybe green, maybe red."

488
00:35:05,906 --> 00:35:06,906
[Laughter.]

489
00:35:07,154 --> 00:35:13,986
Like we had one old gentleman, not very old,
as old as Myself – but he was to come to

490
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:17,347
My house and he telephoned to Me.

491
00:35:17,372 --> 00:35:20,269
He said, “I want to come to Your house so
how should I come?”

492
00:35:20,294 --> 00:35:24,349
I said, “This place is Oxted, you can come
there but if you don’t get a taxi then it’s

493
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:26,293
very difficult, better come to Hurst Green."

494
00:35:26,317 --> 00:35:27,337
He said, “Where?”

495
00:35:27,362 --> 00:35:29,456
I said, “Hurst Green."

496
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:31,774
So he said, “Hurst Blue?”

497
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:34,692
How he is saying blue to green, I don’t
know.

498
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:37,239
(note: ‘Hearse Blue’ is a famous colour)
I said, “No, it’s Hurst Green."

499
00:35:37,264 --> 00:35:38,858
He said, “What did you say?”

500
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:40,859
I said, “Hurst Green."

501
00:35:42,205 --> 00:35:45,017
So he couldn’t understand.

502
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,013
“What is the second one?”

503
00:35:47,038 --> 00:35:51,476
I said, “What is the colour of the leaves?”

504
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:52,708
He said, “Blue."

505
00:35:59,817 --> 00:36:03,710
(Laughter.)

506
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:09,231
I said it to Gregoire, I said, “Now listen
to him, what is he saying?

507
00:36:09,256 --> 00:36:12,501
Colour of the leaves is blue?”

508
00:36:12,526 --> 00:36:21,246
So, Gregoire lifted the phone he said, “Alright,
you come to Hurst Blue."

509
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:23,239
(Laughter)
So he said, “Now at least…”

510
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,465
I said, “What are you telling?”

511
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:29,397
Such a confused personality, mixing between
blue and green!

512
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:30,538
You are fighting.

513
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,851
That’s what it is.

514
00:36:31,876 --> 00:36:34,935
The attention drifts.

515
00:36:35,007 --> 00:36:39,637
So try to see that if you are confused, there
is confusion, clear it out by clearing out

516
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:40,662
your chakras.

517
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:47,336
Now every chakra, let’s have a little testing
of it alright, let’s see?

518
00:36:47,614 --> 00:36:49,241
One by one.

519
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:51,639
So who are going to answer the questions?

520
00:36:51,664 --> 00:36:52,556
Let’s see.

521
00:36:52,581 --> 00:36:53,720
Simple questions.

522
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,585
Not ‘Mastermind’ (a British TV competition
of 1970s and 80s).

523
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,437
Very simple questions.

524
00:36:58,462 --> 00:37:03,039
Now, say your Hamsa Chakra is catching, what
should we do?

525
00:37:03,064 --> 00:37:06,944
Who will answer the question?

526
00:37:07,904 --> 00:37:11,358
Hamsa Chakra is catching, what should we do?

527
00:37:11,383 --> 00:37:13,127
Let’s see, one by one.

528
00:37:13,152 --> 00:37:15,053
Sahaja Yogi: Hamsa, Hamsa.

529
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:19,234
Shri Mataji: That’s the name of the chakra.

530
00:37:19,259 --> 00:37:23,171
Sahaja Yogi: Someone said to me that you say
Hamsa.

531
00:37:23,196 --> 00:37:27,596
Shri Mataji: No…you see this is the Hamsa
Chakra so you have to say that, “Twameva

532
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:36,401
sakshat, Hamsa Chakra Swamini sakshat, Shri
Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh, namah."

533
00:37:36,435 --> 00:37:37,825
See, opened now.

534
00:37:42,323 --> 00:37:45,648
Now say it, all of you, because just now you
are catching.

535
00:37:45,645 --> 00:37:48,635
Now put your finger like this and now say
it.

536
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,673
(Everyone says the mantra).

537
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:07,221
Say it again.

538
00:38:07,221 --> 00:38:08,221
Say it thrice.

539
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:09,221
[Everyone repeats twice more] See?

540
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:46,806
Better.

541
00:38:50,477 --> 00:38:57,776
Now, what happens in this centre that both
the Nadis, Ha and Tha, Ida and Pingala, they

542
00:38:57,776 --> 00:39:00,746
come and meet and they cross over.

543
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:10,155
So, for the right Nadi, right side, this one,
the left Nadi flows and from the right side,

544
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:15,460
the one which comes from the right side flows
into left side.

545
00:39:15,485 --> 00:39:21,372
These two centres meet here, I mean two Nadis
meet here actually, below the Agnya, it’s

546
00:39:21,397 --> 00:39:27,455
below the Agnya at Hamsa, you see, and the
problems come to you either from the right

547
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,376
or from the left.

548
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:35,255
Most of you catch on Hamsa here, because of
cold or whatever it is.

549
00:39:35,881 --> 00:39:39,656
Now, I have told you many things by which
you control your cold.

550
00:39:39,681 --> 00:39:49,482
But if it is due to the left side, left side
catching is there, then for left side Hamsa

551
00:39:49,507 --> 00:39:51,739
what should you do?

552
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,314
Tell Me.

553
00:39:59,883 --> 00:40:05,490
Sahaja Yogi: Keep your eyes on the ground,
on the green.

554
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:12,694
Shri Mataji: That’s one of them, but another
thing, I mean as far as mantra is concerned

555
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:15,419
what mantra will you say…

556
00:40:15,444 --> 00:40:18,009
Sahaja Yogi: Ekadasha Rudra.

557
00:40:18,034 --> 00:40:21,824
Shri Mataji: No that’s much higher, that’s
even above the Agnya.

558
00:40:21,849 --> 00:40:23,716
Sahaja Yogi: Mahakali.

559
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:25,848
Shri Mataji: Mahakali, correct.

560
00:40:25,873 --> 00:40:28,062
But you can say Ida, Ida Nadi.

561
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:32,648
Now see just now I have told you that it is
the Ida Nadi which comes from the left and

562
00:40:32,673 --> 00:40:34,801
goes to the right side.

563
00:40:35,388 --> 00:40:41,388
So, you have to say Mahakali or Ida Nadi,
Ida Nadi Swamini.

564
00:40:41,413 --> 00:40:42,148
Now say it.

565
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:45,285
Just now you are catching on the left.

566
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:51,450
[Sahaja Yogis take mantra of ‘Ida Nadi Swamini’.]

567
00:41:03,578 --> 00:41:05,289
Shri Mataji: Again.

568
00:41:05,314 --> 00:41:07,713
[Everyone says the mantra.]

569
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,430
Shri Mataji: Again.

570
00:41:42,798 --> 00:41:49,078
Now, then another thing, that supposing your
right side is catching, or you have a liver

571
00:41:49,078 --> 00:41:58,058
problem, then what should be used – light,
sun’s rays or water?

572
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:04,802
Sahaja Yogi: Water.

573
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:11,589
Shri Mataji: See, right side is heat, is Surya
Nadi.

574
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:16,649
So you have problem of Surya Nadi – right
side.

575
00:42:16,674 --> 00:42:21,474
So to neutralize it you have to use something
else.

576
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:30,882
So then that time what you have to say, is
to – you can say, you can take the name

577
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:38,307
of Chandra, you’ll cool down.

578
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:43,003
If there is heat on the right hand side, you
should take the name of Chandra.

579
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:48,041
If it is the left side catching, then you
have to take the name of Surya.

580
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:52,433
For example you are possessed, then go and
sit in the Sun – all the bhoots will run

581
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:52,917
away.

582
00:42:52,931 --> 00:42:54,861
They run away from Sun.

583
00:42:54,881 --> 00:43:00,725
But supposing you are an egoistical person
then go and sit in the moonlight.

584
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,699
May be you’ll be little lunatic.

585
00:43:02,724 --> 00:43:08,903
(Laughter) It comes from the word ‘luna’,
you see?

586
00:43:08,965 --> 00:43:14,397
But if you are a crying type and all the time
over-romantic [it’s] better not look at

587
00:43:14,422 --> 00:43:17,579
the moon and better see the sun.

588
00:43:17,604 --> 00:43:20,050
See the compensations.

589
00:43:20,075 --> 00:43:24,484
This is absolutely understanding that many
people, if they have liver they put in this

590
00:43:24,509 --> 00:43:25,199
[fire].

591
00:43:25,246 --> 00:43:27,542
What can the fire do now?

592
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:29,342
There’s already fire here.

593
00:43:29,422 --> 00:43:32,372
Adding fire to the fire again, you see?

594
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:41,028
But, also, what one can do is to take out
this fire and give it to this one.

595
00:43:41,053 --> 00:43:43,676
Now, how do you do that?

596
00:43:46,785 --> 00:43:48,491
Sahaja Yogi: Lemon?

597
00:43:48,516 --> 00:43:49,900
Shri Mataji: No, no.

598
00:43:49,925 --> 00:43:50,955
to fire.

599
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,468
Supposing I want to treat My liver with fire.

600
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:55,889
How do I do it?

601
00:43:55,914 --> 00:44:01,418
Sahaja Yogi: You put your finger actually
to the flame so that it burns off.

602
00:44:01,443 --> 00:44:02,684
Shri Mataji: No.

603
00:44:02,709 --> 00:44:05,051
Sahaja Yogi: It’ll take too much a week!

604
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:07,999
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s correct but something

605
00:44:08,024 --> 00:44:09,617
takes some times about it.

606
00:44:09,642 --> 00:44:12,398
Think it over then, think it over, take it
over.

607
00:44:12,423 --> 00:44:17,780
You see, you have to take out your heat and
give it to these heights.

608
00:44:17,805 --> 00:44:19,426
How do you do it?

609
00:44:19,451 --> 00:44:21,046
Think it over.

610
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,197
I’ll tell you simple thing is: this left
hand is minus, this [right hand] is plus,

611
00:44:32,222 --> 00:44:33,982
you can take like that, alright?

612
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:36,165
So whatever you do with left hand you suck
in.

613
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:40,501
Whatever you do with right hand, say, for
example, you give out.

614
00:44:40,526 --> 00:44:41,135
Alright?

615
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:47,708
So now if you want to now give out, what you
do is to put left hand on you here and right

616
00:44:47,733 --> 00:44:48,733
hand outside.

617
00:44:50,493 --> 00:44:54,999
So this is cooling it here actually and the
heat is going there.

618
00:44:55,024 --> 00:45:00,781
But if you do the other way round, you are
sucking heat.

619
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:05,188
Sahaja Yogi : Hum
Shri Mataji: But from the left hand side you

620
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:06,676
do it like that.

621
00:45:06,701 --> 00:45:09,474
Just electronics, alright, then?

622
00:45:09,544 --> 00:45:15,881
Now if you burn here is a good idea, very
good idea for Left Nabhi.

623
00:45:15,906 --> 00:45:18,026
So the Left Nabhi gets heated up.

624
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,008
This side needs heat.

625
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:23,093
This side needs cooling.

626
00:45:23,118 --> 00:45:25,113
This is the basics.

627
00:45:25,346 --> 00:45:29,401
If something wrong with this side (right)
you have to give it the cool.

628
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:33,220
If something wrong this side, you have to
give it the heat.

629
00:45:35,982 --> 00:45:39,552
Some people get too much cool vibrations.

630
00:45:39,552 --> 00:45:43,098
They’ll perspire and cool, means left is
finished.

631
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:45,770
Now what should they do as far as fire is
concerned?

632
00:45:45,795 --> 00:45:47,175
Let’s see.

633
00:45:53,572 --> 00:45:56,654
Sahaj Yogini: [inaudible] right hand here
Shri Mataji: He perspires.

634
00:45:56,705 --> 00:45:59,182
Right hand on the heart, left hand here.

635
00:45:59,207 --> 00:46:01,942
If anyone perspires, it means his heart is
weak.

636
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:06,783
So put right hand here and left hand on the
heart.

637
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:09,558
The heat comes in.

638
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:13,612
Are you following the electronics, no, the
electrical?

639
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:16,003
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

640
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:19,769
Shri Mataji: So the basics if you know that
the left side is the cool side, the right

641
00:46:19,794 --> 00:46:22,359
side is the hot side.

642
00:46:22,384 --> 00:46:27,138
And above the hand, this is the minus side,
this is the plus side.

643
00:46:27,163 --> 00:46:30,995
Even you can do like this and you are balancing
yourself.

644
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:37,162
That’s why in India we do, specially if
you see a great bhootish [person] then you’ll

645
00:46:37,187 --> 00:46:39,146
do like this, fully.

646
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:41,839
You see?

647
00:46:42,255 --> 00:46:53,585
So, these two sides are: one is the hot side,
one is a cold side, while the Sattwa Guna

648
00:46:53,621 --> 00:46:59,576
is the meeting point, is lukewarm.

649
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:04,579
The Sattwa Guna gives you the temperature
that you have.

650
00:47:04,604 --> 00:47:05,684
Alright?

651
00:47:05,998 --> 00:47:09,316
And these two give you either very cold or
very hot.

652
00:47:09,832 --> 00:47:12,950
So we come back to now sinus again.

653
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:15,478
It is which side problem?

654
00:47:19,066 --> 00:47:20,846
Sahaja Yogis: Left hand side.

655
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,210
Shri Mataji: Correct!

656
00:47:22,235 --> 00:47:26,273
Left side, because there are three things
now in our bodies.

657
00:47:26,298 --> 00:47:29,038
One is…what do you say to that?

658
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:30,063
Bulgam.

659
00:47:31,299 --> 00:47:40,322
Another is the bile and the third one is the
gas or Vayu.

660
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,877
Alright?

661
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:45,568
So the left side is the Kapha.

662
00:47:45,593 --> 00:47:51,163
All these colds and things are due to left
side.

663
00:47:51,198 --> 00:47:54,659
And the right side is the bile.

664
00:47:55,048 --> 00:48:00,257
The fat is created from bulgam, which doctors
do not know.

665
00:48:00,282 --> 00:48:02,492
Do you know that?

666
00:48:05,678 --> 00:48:15,865
When fat is heated up by the right hand side,
then it dissolves and the gas movement is

667
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,590
in the centre.

668
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:26,440
When these five types of gases which are within
us, when they all combine together and get

669
00:48:26,465 --> 00:48:32,601
enlightened by the Spirit, you get the Cool
Breeze coming out.

670
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:36,456
So the centre path is the prana.

671
00:48:36,456 --> 00:48:59,109
When it gets absolutely heated up then diseases
like tuberculosis, all these things can come

672
00:48:59,134 --> 00:49:00,134
in.

673
00:49:02,546 --> 00:49:09,656
And when it gets heated up on the left hand
side you get tuberculosis and all these things

674
00:49:09,681 --> 00:49:11,952
due to too much heat.

675
00:49:11,977 --> 00:49:16,336
When it gets heated too much, then it comes
to the right hand side and you get diseases

676
00:49:16,361 --> 00:49:21,261
like liver and all these heatening things
on the right hand side.

677
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:34,500
So though the left hand side is cold, if it
is heated up then also diseases are caused.

678
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:41,425
Now we have to go into details sometimes to
find out what, basically, are our diseases

679
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:43,220
within our body.

680
00:49:43,813 --> 00:49:46,609
We should know what is our disease.

681
00:49:46,768 --> 00:49:50,849
Sometimes even if you have ordinary cold,
it is a disease, according to Sahaja Yoga.

682
00:49:50,874 --> 00:49:53,799
You should be a normal person.

683
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:59,100
Supposing you are suffering from, say, the
terrible disease, the greatest nuisance and

684
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:05,328
the blessing of London and England put together
– is cold.

685
00:50:05,353 --> 00:50:09,795
Call it hay fever, day fever, or anything!

686
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,092
So it is due to what?

687
00:50:13,117 --> 00:50:21,917
It is due to basically within us less resistance,
no immunity.

688
00:50:22,564 --> 00:50:28,779
Less resistance come to us because of lack
of calcium within us.

689
00:50:28,804 --> 00:50:36,149
Those people who have taken proper care in
childhood, taken vitamin A and D and good

690
00:50:36,174 --> 00:50:42,667
massage, say with cod liver oil or olive oil
and things like that, and proper sunning of

691
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:47,522
the body is done, such people suffer less
from cold.

692
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:51,190
Specially the Vishuddhi Chakra problem it
is.

693
00:50:51,399 --> 00:50:56,392
Now those people who have not been careful
about their Vishuddhi Chakra get the disease

694
00:50:56,432 --> 00:51:02,639
settled within themselves, but when this disease
is settled, what happens actually?

695
00:51:03,096 --> 00:51:09,546
What is the reason, as we said that it is
the left hand side problem.

696
00:51:09,705 --> 00:51:13,911
Cold is a left hand side problem.

697
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:19,361
That means cold has something to do with your
emotional side.

698
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:24,463
That means there’s something also wrong
emotionally with you.

699
00:51:24,692 --> 00:51:29,712
So it indicates that you have some emotional
problem.

700
00:51:29,762 --> 00:51:37,478
According to Sahaj Yog, to overcome cold one
should see into this emotional life of oneself.

701
00:51:37,503 --> 00:51:39,954
What are you doing about your emotions?

702
00:51:39,985 --> 00:51:48,617
For example as soon as you’re affected by
emotions, you will start crying or sneezing.

703
00:51:50,835 --> 00:51:53,882
(Laughter)
This is a fact.

704
00:51:53,892 --> 00:51:58,182
If these are girls, they’ll start crying.

705
00:51:58,182 --> 00:52:00,780
If they are men, they’ll start coughing
or sneezing.

706
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,064
They’ll cough for nothing at all.

707
00:52:03,089 --> 00:52:06,455
You see [Shri Mataji coughs] they will go.

708
00:52:09,441 --> 00:52:11,966
[Laughter]
Isn’t it a fact?

709
00:52:11,991 --> 00:52:14,721
Unnecessarily they’ll be doing like this.

710
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:19,213
Is an emotional thing, to attract the attention
maybe or whatever it is.

711
00:52:19,238 --> 00:52:25,880
To say that how pitiable they are, you see,
is a thing by which we show our pitiable condition.

712
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:31,502
You see, is a thing, we reduce ourselves to
a position by which we try to, you see, excite

713
00:52:31,555 --> 00:52:33,698
the pity in other person.

714
00:52:33,747 --> 00:52:37,445
So this cold is due to our emotional problem.

715
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:40,555
Now so we should see what is our emotional
problem.

716
00:52:40,555 --> 00:52:49,555
We should find out how much ‘Romeos’ we
are [Shri burst into laughs].

717
00:52:49,555 --> 00:52:53,419
And how much delight of life we miss by that.

718
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:06,429
Once you start understanding that you are
your own Romeo and you are your own Juliet

719
00:53:06,699 --> 00:53:09,196
– most of you will get rid of your colds.

720
00:53:09,221 --> 00:53:12,571
Take it from Me.

721
00:53:12,629 --> 00:53:14,410
It is some sort of an emotional problem.

722
00:53:14,435 --> 00:53:17,990
Could be with your father.

723
00:53:18,015 --> 00:53:20,944
A person who is very attached to his father.

724
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:26,216
‘Attached’ is the word best is, gets also
attached to cold.

725
00:53:26,316 --> 00:53:29,177
Attached to mother is even worse.

726
00:53:29,177 --> 00:53:35,067
If somebody is very attached to her mother,
you see, then all reasoning fails and then

727
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:41,534
the mother misbehaves or does something and
the child feels very hurt, the child cries,

728
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:43,547
he gets the cold.

729
00:53:45,486 --> 00:53:52,815
Any such attachment which makes you foolish
should be given up, to get rid of your cold,

730
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,260
I mean to say.

731
00:53:55,016 --> 00:54:05,183
Whatever makes you stupid, foolish or hankering
after someone, creates troubles like colds.

732
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,881
‘Romeos’ specially.

733
00:54:07,906 --> 00:54:15,227
Then very beloved children, beloved fathers,
beloved mothers, you see, the ones for them

734
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:20,011
their daughter is important, their son is
important.

735
00:54:20,036 --> 00:54:24,618
Some people just don’t love their children
and if some love they’ll dump them onto

736
00:54:24,643 --> 00:54:26,627
everybody else.

737
00:54:27,382 --> 00:54:29,062
So these two types of it.

738
00:54:29,062 --> 00:54:35,362
You must know that you are just a trustee
of your child and as far as your ‘Romeo-ness’

739
00:54:35,383 --> 00:54:41,614
is concerned, you are just to see drama of
your Romeo, that’s all.

740
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:48,269
Then this detachment will take place and a
simple disease like cold which looks so horrible,

741
00:54:48,269 --> 00:54:49,619
incurable, can be cured.

742
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:57,614
As long as you people have cold, without having
any romantic feelings Myself, I also get it.

743
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:05,558
So I request you to rise above these things
and become more sensible, and your attitude

744
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:15,855
should be of enhancing mutual understanding,
mutual love, and not romantic feelings.

745
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:22,264
But worse than that is dry feelings, on the
right hand side you know.

746
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:27,493
Then if you have a dry throat you cannot even
speak.

747
00:55:27,518 --> 00:55:35,652
Suddenly you find -finished- [laughs] you
just can’t speak because you are dried.

748
00:55:36,268 --> 00:55:40,744
So the other side is where some people try
some psychological tricks with their wives

749
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:45,113
or husbands – like “I will not speak”.

750
00:55:45,262 --> 00:55:49,754
This I’m telling you just an emotional side
of life.

751
00:55:49,945 --> 00:55:51,869
“I’ll not talk to her.

752
00:55:51,894 --> 00:55:53,669
I’ll not speak.

753
00:55:53,694 --> 00:55:56,094
I’ll behave like this."

754
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,119
Dryness.

755
00:55:58,145 --> 00:56:00,191
That also kills the delight.

756
00:56:00,216 --> 00:56:05,784
The one is overdoing of it and one is not
doing of it.

757
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:12,164
You see, either you’ll take sugar which
is one ton in one glass, or you will not take

758
00:56:12,189 --> 00:56:13,189
sugar at all.

759
00:56:13,214 --> 00:56:16,368
You will not take one spoon of sugar.

760
00:56:17,334 --> 00:56:21,680
Not more, not less, you see, to have the optimum
delight of tea.

761
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:28,763
In the same way, in life also, you should
not take too much of something and too little

762
00:56:28,788 --> 00:56:30,160
of another thing.

763
00:56:30,209 --> 00:56:36,107
Now somebody who’s married now, for that
person, Indian women specially, husband becomes

764
00:56:36,132 --> 00:56:40,093
last one, then everything else is zero.

765
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,971
Then such women are useless.

766
00:56:43,052 --> 00:56:48,477
Or men that I’ve seen here, they are just
mad on their women.

767
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:51,281
For them also, life is useless.

768
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:55,264
So take a balanced attitude of the whole thing
in that.

769
00:56:55,391 --> 00:57:02,208
It is in you is the person who is loving your
wife, who is also within you.

770
00:57:02,368 --> 00:57:05,387
You are your wife, you are your husband.

771
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:12,045
Now the wife who is your wife outside, if
she just does not tally with the wife that

772
00:57:12,063 --> 00:57:17,090
you have within your mind, that should not
upset you, because that wife is always with

773
00:57:17,115 --> 00:57:18,090
you.

774
00:57:20,122 --> 00:57:24,827
Once this understanding develops, you see
your partnership -[Shr Mataji aside: by the

775
00:57:24,852 --> 00:57:34,352
way I found your letter]- the partnership
of husband and wife could be absolutely perfect.

776
00:57:35,832 --> 00:57:41,201
Now with the children as I said –
Hello, by what train did you come?

777
00:57:41,226 --> 00:57:42,946
Sahaja Yogi: The late one.

778
00:57:42,946 --> 00:57:48,406
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Real late one this one was!

779
00:57:48,406 --> 00:57:49,904
What about your food?

780
00:57:49,929 --> 00:57:50,945
Sahaja Yogi: We both had some.

781
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:51,790
Shri Mataji: Really?

782
00:57:51,815 --> 00:57:52,455
Where?

783
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,152
Sahaja Yogi: In Winchester.

784
00:57:54,177 --> 00:57:56,610
Shri Mataji: You were telling something else.

785
00:57:56,635 --> 00:57:57,635
Where?

786
00:57:57,858 --> 00:58:03,008
I mean if you are telling the truth you’ll
tell the same thing.

787
00:58:03,008 --> 00:58:05,616
Sahaja Yogi: We had some chicken from the
Fish & chip shop.

788
00:58:05,641 --> 00:58:06,548
Shri Mataji: Alright.

789
00:58:06,573 --> 00:58:08,848
There is some food if you want, please have.

790
00:58:08,873 --> 00:58:10,603
Please let them have…..

791
00:58:19,118 --> 00:58:22,025
We were just missing you all.

792
00:58:28,659 --> 00:58:35,765
Yes, very good, very cool and nice (vibrations).

793
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:36,790
Good.

794
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,192
May God bless you.

795
00:58:38,217 --> 00:58:41,177
So you go and have your food.

796
00:58:41,177 --> 00:58:49,747
Now, why making it so light : for you to understand
that marriage is not a serious problem.

797
00:58:49,747 --> 00:59:03,064
[laughter] As long as you have your ideal
with yourself and you don’t try to impose

798
00:59:03,089 --> 00:59:08,606
that on your wife, or the wife does not try
to impose that on your husband.

799
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:12,592
Let the wife be a wife and husband be a husband.

800
00:59:12,732 --> 00:59:17,877
But the wife should not become the husband
and the husband should not become wife.

801
00:59:17,902 --> 00:59:22,551
If that happens, then I don’t know how to
correct it, because that’s something absurd

802
00:59:22,576 --> 00:59:24,327
if that happens.

803
00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:32,279
Now, on that the main thing one has to know
is that you are married to have children,

804
00:59:32,957 --> 00:59:35,480
not to be Romeo and Juliet anymore.

805
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,460
You better have your children.

806
00:59:37,485 --> 00:59:43,909
And then the children that will be born to
Sahaja Yogis are going to be realized souls,

807
00:59:43,934 --> 00:59:45,964
tremendous source of energy.

808
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:51,240
That’s why you are married, that’s why
you are going to have children.

809
00:59:51,265 --> 00:59:54,593
Then look after your children with respect,
regard.

810
00:59:54,618 --> 00:59:56,828
Don’t spoil them!

811
00:59:57,076 --> 01:00:01,226
And develop [them] in that love of Sahaja
Yoga.

812
01:00:01,226 --> 01:00:05,376
Now this we started with our Hamsa Chakra.

813
01:00:05,376 --> 01:00:09,132
Now see the Hamsa Chakra is the left and the
right.

814
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:11,960
The left is the woman, the right is the man.

815
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:13,861
They meet at Hamsa.

816
01:00:13,886 --> 01:00:19,286
So this is the wedding place of your left
and right.

817
01:00:19,644 --> 01:00:24,780
If there is no balance between the two, there
is a problem.

818
01:00:25,207 --> 01:00:27,347
They have to be equal.

819
01:00:27,347 --> 01:00:29,797
But they are not similar.

820
01:00:29,797 --> 01:00:32,217
Left is left.

821
01:00:32,217 --> 01:00:33,946
Right is right.

822
01:00:33,971 --> 01:00:41,086
So the right must be on the right hand side,
left must be on the left hand side and here

823
01:00:41,111 --> 01:00:47,917
when they come, they marry, and this is the
point one must know that, whatever is the

824
01:00:47,942 --> 01:00:53,986
function of a wife is, she should do that
first whatever is the function of the husband

825
01:00:54,011 --> 01:00:56,192
is, he should do that first.

826
01:00:56,217 --> 01:01:02,260
And then the secondary functions of life can
be shared and understood.

827
01:01:02,293 --> 01:01:08,303
But it’s not possible that the wife goes
to work and husband starts producing children.

828
01:01:08,303 --> 01:01:10,697
You cannot do it!

829
01:01:10,722 --> 01:01:13,325
[Laughter] And the other way round.

830
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:16,560
So whatever is the work is so important.

831
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,014
To be a mother, I think, is the most important.

832
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:24,260
Today if you didn’t have a mother, which
father would have done this work, you tell

833
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:24,749
Me.

834
01:01:24,774 --> 01:01:26,221
Which one?

835
01:01:26,246 --> 01:01:27,814
Can you think of anyone?

836
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:33,087
There may be ‘Father in Heaven’, but Father
on this Earth working with all Sahaja Yogis,

837
01:01:33,112 --> 01:01:35,478
let Me see which one is there.

838
01:01:35,503 --> 01:01:37,888
Anyone of these fathers, you call them.

839
01:01:37,899 --> 01:01:41,420
Nicely to sit down on Heaven and watch the
whole stuff.

840
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,399
But who’s going to do the work?

841
01:01:43,424 --> 01:01:49,279
Washing the dirty linen and washing all the
napkins and things is done by Mother.

842
01:01:49,895 --> 01:01:59,158
She does this with love and attention and
with care, and She is the one who knows how

843
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:00,978
to grow Her children.

844
01:02:01,003 --> 01:02:02,813
Is the job of a mother.

845
01:02:02,838 --> 01:02:04,838
So Mother’s job Mother can do.

846
01:02:04,863 --> 01:02:06,428
Father can sit in the Heaven very nicely.

847
01:02:06,439 --> 01:02:08,327
All thanks goes to the Father.

848
01:02:08,327 --> 01:02:11,637
While the Mother is doing a thankless job
here!

849
01:02:11,662 --> 01:02:13,677
Alright, doesn’t matter.

850
01:02:13,677 --> 01:02:19,098
It is so, so should be accepted, whatever
may be the situation, whatever may be the

851
01:02:19,123 --> 01:02:20,596
position.

852
01:02:21,587 --> 01:02:30,145
Now at Hamsa Chakra, this understanding must
come that you must balance both the nadis,

853
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:32,574
the left and the right.

854
01:02:32,644 --> 01:02:39,741
Now to balance the left and the right, the
best way is to do some breathing, is to take

855
01:02:39,747 --> 01:02:46,719
the air through one nostril and keep it waiting
here for a while and then allow it to go out

856
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:47,881
of the other.

857
01:02:47,941 --> 01:02:52,635
Then you breathe in with this one, allow it
to stay here for a while and then allow it

858
01:02:52,656 --> 01:02:53,720
to go down.

859
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:56,486
But it is to be done very slowly.

860
01:02:56,586 --> 01:02:58,275
Not in a hurry, not too much.

861
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,213
Only thrice (3 times).

862
01:03:00,238 --> 01:03:02,456
Best thing that I’ve told you is neti.

863
01:03:02,481 --> 01:03:08,357
If not that, another thing I have seen that
those inhalers, you see that you get, are

864
01:03:08,382 --> 01:03:09,137
very good.

865
01:03:09,162 --> 01:03:10,743
The neti thing that I’ve given you.

866
01:03:10,768 --> 01:03:19,983
If you fill the water below the spout and
fill it, put in some two, three drops of one

867
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:25,480
of those things that you get for inhaling
and put that neti thing in one nose only,

868
01:03:25,505 --> 01:03:27,885
and with another nose it goes up.

869
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:31,090
Then you come, bring it here, it goes up and
clears it out.

870
01:03:31,115 --> 01:03:32,545
It’s a very good thing.

871
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:36,572
If you do it every night before sleeping,
in three, four days you’ll be absolutely

872
01:03:36,597 --> 01:03:37,767
cleared out.

873
01:03:38,946 --> 01:03:43,943
But the main thing is: it comes because of
imbalances in our temperaments.

874
01:03:43,968 --> 01:03:49,288
Like a man is a man, woman is a woman, alright,
so the woman starts dominating a man or a

875
01:03:49,313 --> 01:03:52,203
man starts dominating the woman.

876
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:53,977
The balance is broken.

877
01:03:54,044 --> 01:03:57,767
Once you understand the woman is very important
– without the woman you cannot, could not

878
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,792
have been here.

879
01:03:58,972 --> 01:03:59,493
Alright?

880
01:03:59,573 --> 01:04:01,418
Without a woman you cannot be here.

881
01:04:01,735 --> 01:04:05,598
Man is very important that woman has no meaning
without a man.

882
01:04:05,623 --> 01:04:08,619
You see, Shakti has no meaning without God.

883
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:10,434
For whom is She working?

884
01:04:10,434 --> 01:04:12,270
For whom is She doing all this?

885
01:04:12,295 --> 01:04:13,725
For God to be pleased.

886
01:04:13,826 --> 01:04:16,678
If there’s nobody to see the job, why should
She do it?

887
01:04:16,703 --> 01:04:18,302
So both have great meaning.

888
01:04:18,416 --> 01:04:25,915
And if you understand that both beings within
us are balanced, understood, respected in

889
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:37,093
their proper ways and shared and coordinated,
the personalities in proper understanding,

890
01:04:37,153 --> 01:04:43,441
respect and love, your Hamsa will be alright.

891
01:04:44,863 --> 01:04:46,333
You’ll feel better.

892
01:04:46,358 --> 01:04:54,486
So you have to correct your ideas about marriage,
about women, about men, about yourself.

893
01:04:54,625 --> 01:05:02,575
That’s very important because it is a very
big emotional thing and, as the left side

894
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:07,915
is weak, all people who have left side weak
get cold.

895
01:05:07,994 --> 01:05:12,753
And all the things that has to do with your
– they call it bulgam, is it?

896
01:05:12,818 --> 01:05:14,368
What’s it called?

897
01:05:14,393 --> 01:05:15,373
Sahaja Yogis: Plegm.

898
01:05:15,398 --> 01:05:16,948
Shri Mataji: Phlegm.

899
01:05:16,973 --> 01:05:17,572
Phlegm.

900
01:05:17,597 --> 01:05:18,626
Phlegm.

901
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:21,314
It has to do with your phlegm.

902
01:05:21,339 --> 01:05:32,593
So emotional side is to be properly nourished
and looked after and one has to know that

903
01:05:32,618 --> 01:05:34,630
your dignity is the most important.

904
01:05:34,655 --> 01:05:38,475
Anything indignified is not love.

905
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,438
Love is very dignified.

906
01:05:41,006 --> 01:05:45,376
And if you keep your dignity, you’ll be
amazed how you will be able to solve certain

907
01:05:45,421 --> 01:05:46,421
problems.

908
01:05:49,389 --> 01:05:51,733
Now, again I’ll ask you a question.

909
01:05:52,036 --> 01:05:54,480
Now, how many have answered the questions?

910
01:05:54,505 --> 01:05:56,385
Most of them you answered very well.

911
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:00,363
Now one more question I will ask.

912
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:05,782
Very simple, not so difficult.

913
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:15,511
That: what is a difference between a baddha
and a bhoot?

914
01:06:16,114 --> 01:06:19,207
How will you make out?

915
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:22,443
A hindrance and a bhoot.

916
01:06:25,136 --> 01:06:27,316
Sahaja Yogi: Bhoots will move around.

917
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:30,491
Shri Mataji: And baddha?

918
01:06:30,516 --> 01:06:31,818
Sahaja Yogi: Stays there.

919
01:06:31,843 --> 01:06:34,672
Just describing, it’s a block at that point.

920
01:06:34,697 --> 01:06:39,383
Shri Mataji: Though it’s correct, [what]
you said is correct, but it is not absolutely

921
01:06:39,408 --> 01:06:40,408
precise.

922
01:06:40,433 --> 01:06:42,690
It is like this, I tell you.

923
01:06:42,715 --> 01:06:43,858
It’s correct.

924
01:06:43,883 --> 01:06:46,302
I mean what he says is the correct answer
but it’s not so precise.

925
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,777
Baddha will also move.

926
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:51,318
I’ll tell you how.

927
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,724
Baddha is always on the centres or on your
organs, say.

928
01:06:55,761 --> 01:07:04,267
If it is, say, in your, for example in the
liver, this baddha may come in the centre

929
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:11,329
and then it will start moving from your here
to here as the Kundalini will move.

930
01:07:11,354 --> 01:07:12,354
Alright?

931
01:07:13,078 --> 01:07:16,275
But baddha doesn’t have its arbitrary movement.

932
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,752
As you move the Kundalini, the baddha moves.

933
01:07:17,777 --> 01:07:18,999
‘Baddha’ means the hindrance.

934
01:07:19,024 --> 01:07:20,024
Alright?

935
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:23,106
But a bhoot is arbitrary.

936
01:07:24,441 --> 01:07:25,693
It moves.

937
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:28,868
It will be one moment here, it will be one
moment there.

938
01:07:29,059 --> 01:07:31,341
It will move this side, it will move that
side.

939
01:07:31,535 --> 01:07:34,174
It will go to the right heart, then it will
come to the left heart.

940
01:07:34,265 --> 01:07:40,524
If it is arbitrary behaviour, that means it
is not controlled by your movement of your

941
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:45,190
fingers through the Kundalini awakening then
you must know it is a bhoot.

942
01:07:45,841 --> 01:07:46,841
Alright?

943
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:51,887
Now understand what I’m saying by decisive
thing, that, one thing is arbitrary, works

944
01:07:51,912 --> 01:07:59,256
on its own, and the another is in your control.

945
01:07:59,281 --> 01:08:02,510
You’re taking it out yourself.

946
01:08:02,629 --> 01:08:09,150
Like you can say that if there’s some lump
in the body, it may start moving with the,

947
01:08:09,175 --> 01:08:13,114
say, bloodstream or something, some force
acting upon it.

948
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:15,233
But by itself, it does not.

949
01:08:15,551 --> 01:08:19,969
But if there’s a worm, living worm, it will
move by itself.

950
01:08:22,151 --> 01:08:27,427
So the last question is then, how do you manage
the baddha and the bhoot?

951
01:08:30,991 --> 01:08:35,075
How will you take out the bhoot of other people
without getting yourself into it?

952
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:41,025
Otherwise the person whose bhoot has to be
taken out will put three bhoots in you and

953
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,925
five in the others.

954
01:08:44,969 --> 01:08:51,353
(laughing) I have seen many a times they’ll
come and tell Me, “Mother, he’s possessed."

955
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:52,378
Alright.

956
01:08:52,403 --> 01:09:02,314
And they themselves are! (laughter) How do
you take out?

957
01:09:03,869 --> 01:09:05,331
Come along.

958
01:09:07,353 --> 01:09:10,258
Sahaja Yogini: Bandhan
Shri Mataji: What?

959
01:09:10,283 --> 01:09:11,283
Bandhan?

960
01:09:11,308 --> 01:09:11,783
No!

961
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:20,627
Sahaja Yogi:You can throw the bhoot into a
candle.

962
01:09:20,652 --> 01:09:22,503
Shri Mataji: I mean, I’m saying a real one.

963
01:09:22,528 --> 01:09:25,489
He’s not even afraid of candle.

964
01:09:25,514 --> 01:09:35,126
Sahaja Yogini 2: Say the mantra to Mukti Devi
Sahaja Yogini 3: The Lord’s Prayer

965
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:38,583
Shri Mataji: There’s no general thing about
it.

966
01:09:38,608 --> 01:09:39,470
Alright?

967
01:09:40,057 --> 01:09:44,882
All answers are correct but they are not complete.

968
01:09:49,938 --> 01:09:59,077
There are ways and method according to different
bhoots…(asid in Marathi with yogini)…

969
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:09,661
They are trying to solve the problems but
[she] said it’s rather difficult!

970
01:10:15,149 --> 01:10:21,692
Now, first of all, you see a person who is
possessed.

971
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:28,263
I mean you are sure he is possessed, so you
do like this, you see.

972
01:10:28,288 --> 01:10:30,120
[Laughter].

973
01:10:30,287 --> 01:10:34,192
Take a form, you have to take a form because
you have to fight it.

974
01:10:34,217 --> 01:10:37,141
You take an aggressive form.

975
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:41,053
Sahaja Yogi: Karate, Tony’s Karate [Tony
Cooly].

976
01:10:41,078 --> 01:10:42,238
Shri Mataji: Karate, yes.

977
01:10:42,263 --> 01:10:43,263
Something like that.

978
01:10:43,418 --> 01:10:49,280
So then, I mean inside you become higher than
that person.

979
01:10:49,489 --> 01:10:52,723
Otherwise if you go like (laughter from yogis).

980
01:10:57,969 --> 01:11:00,635
After some time (more laughter).

981
01:11:00,887 --> 01:11:07,508
So you go with a great force on that person.

982
01:11:08,614 --> 01:11:10,606
You put a bandhan and say, “Now sit down."

983
01:11:10,631 --> 01:11:11,631
Talk to him like this.

984
01:11:12,388 --> 01:11:17,154
You don’t go and say, “Please sit down,”
because the thing will come and sit in you.

985
01:11:18,626 --> 01:11:20,262
Just say, “Now sit down."

986
01:11:20,287 --> 01:11:20,833
Alright.

987
01:11:20,858 --> 01:11:26,452
There you have to say as if you are not compromising
on this.

988
01:11:26,477 --> 01:11:28,833
No compromises.

989
01:11:28,858 --> 01:11:36,114
Then you ask the person various questions,
after giving yourself a bandhan and do that

990
01:11:36,139 --> 01:11:39,046
to verify what sort of a bhoot it could be.

991
01:11:39,071 --> 01:11:40,913
That’s the best.

992
01:11:41,418 --> 01:11:45,926
First of all you ask that person, “Have
you been to any guru?”

993
01:11:46,292 --> 01:11:49,213
So now you know at least sixteen of them.

994
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:51,892
And you know how to take them out, also.

995
01:11:52,561 --> 01:11:55,238
So you find out which bhoot he has been to.

996
01:11:57,149 --> 01:12:01,454
If it is a guru, you just ask the person does
he still believe in that guru.

997
01:12:01,479 --> 01:12:03,805
If so, you have nothing to do with that person.

998
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:05,667
You have no business.

999
01:12:06,334 --> 01:12:08,758
If you say “sorry” it will come inside.

1000
01:12:08,827 --> 01:12:12,766
Any inviting word you should not use.

1001
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:18,817
Just say, “Alright, finished!” you get
out from that one.

1002
01:12:18,921 --> 01:12:20,755
But in case he says, “I am possessed.

1003
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:25,257
I know I am in trouble, I’ve got this thing”
and all that, then you tell that person that

1004
01:12:26,202 --> 01:12:28,771
“What is the name of your guru?

1005
01:12:28,796 --> 01:12:30,254
What is the mantra you got?

1006
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:31,505
How many years you have been?”

1007
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,322
Like that, you ask the question.

1008
01:12:33,568 --> 01:12:38,460
If he is truthful and if he tells you that,
then you exactly know where the mantra is,

1009
01:12:38,485 --> 01:12:40,135
what has happened to him.

1010
01:12:40,892 --> 01:12:42,788
If it is a guru, then it has to be in the
Void.

1011
01:12:43,908 --> 01:12:57,981
If it is in the Void you tell him to say the
mantra of Adi Guru, or ask the question, “Mother,

1012
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:00,190
are You the real…[guru]?” on the photograph.

1013
01:13:00,215 --> 01:13:04,338
Keep the photograph in front of your face
like a mask if possible.

1014
01:13:04,363 --> 01:13:07,523
Don’t allow you yourself to be exposed but
give the photograph to the man.

1015
01:13:07,548 --> 01:13:10,103
You say, “Now ask the question to this photograph."

1016
01:13:10,742 --> 01:13:16,218
Now if the person asks the question, the Kundalini
will start coming here doing “gragaral gagal."

1017
01:13:16,243 --> 01:13:19,719
He’ll also see the thing there, you see,
bubbling up.

1018
01:13:20,179 --> 01:13:24,091
Then you should say that, after asking the
question, “Now you say that, ‘You are

1019
01:13:24,116 --> 01:13:25,116
the guru’!”

1020
01:13:26,707 --> 01:13:31,092
If the person is possessed by a guru, then
if you know the name of the guru, then you

1021
01:13:31,117 --> 01:13:31,877
know the mantra.

1022
01:13:31,902 --> 01:13:35,147
When he’s doing all these things, you go
on saying “Narakasura Mardini” or “Mahishasura

1023
01:13:35,172 --> 01:13:37,883
Mardini” or anything like that, whatever
you have to do.

1024
01:13:37,908 --> 01:13:44,996
Or “Sarva-asura Mardini” For guru this
thing, best thing is salt, vibrated salt.

1025
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:49,433
You give some vibrated salt with water to
that person to drink.

1026
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:55,466
It’s not easy to get rid of the guru, so
you tell him very firmly that he’s one of

1027
01:13:55,863 --> 01:14:00,379
the horrible ones we have ever known, so you
have to work very hard to get rid of it.

1028
01:14:00,404 --> 01:14:03,195
You give him salt, give him all that, let
him do it.

1029
01:14:03,687 --> 01:14:05,346
And do not hurry up.

1030
01:14:07,211 --> 01:14:12,503
Tell him it is going to take time, it will
be alright, and what troubles people had with

1031
01:14:12,528 --> 01:14:14,892
this, and [that] he’ll have to work hard.

1032
01:14:15,427 --> 01:14:18,860
This is one type of bhoots you will find.

1033
01:14:19,352 --> 01:14:27,072
Then you find these are guru bhoots and which
takes time, which are very difficult and they

1034
01:14:27,097 --> 01:14:31,500
can take you up, it can be very dangerous.

1035
01:14:32,151 --> 01:14:36,740
But say, somebody becomes blind with a bhoot.

1036
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:41,275
His eyes are open and he’s blind.

1037
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:45,411
That’s sure shot [that] he is blind because
of a bhoot.

1038
01:14:46,603 --> 01:14:48,661
Two types of blindness are possible.

1039
01:14:49,582 --> 01:14:55,668
The Left Swadhishthana will be catching and
you will see it is due to bhoot.

1040
01:14:56,121 --> 01:15:02,018
But it can be also Left Swadhishthana catching
and becoming blind could be with diabetes.

1041
01:15:03,738 --> 01:15:05,584
Could be the combination of both.

1042
01:15:06,008 --> 01:15:08,179
So you ask him if he has diabetes or not.

1043
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:11,546
If the person has no diabetes, then definitely
it is the bhoot.

1044
01:15:12,279 --> 01:15:15,871
Now what do you do to take out that kind of
a bhoot?

1045
01:15:18,442 --> 01:15:20,267
Sahaja Yogi: You use a candle enlightened.

1046
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,379
Shri Mataji: Not only candle, won’t work.

1047
01:15:23,934 --> 01:15:25,987
You take My hand.

1048
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:28,661
Photograph, only hand.

1049
01:15:28,767 --> 01:15:32,602
You have photographs of My hand, and put a
candle before that photograph.

1050
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:36,523
All these photographs that you have separately
have meanings.

1051
01:15:37,559 --> 01:15:45,791
Put the candle and behind that is the hand
and ask the person to see the light, if he

1052
01:15:45,816 --> 01:15:47,347
can see the light.

1053
01:15:47,794 --> 01:15:50,936
Gradually, you’ll be amazed he will start
seeing.

1054
01:15:52,358 --> 01:15:53,159
This is to be used.

1055
01:15:53,184 --> 01:15:57,835
You see, in Sahaja Yoga, one has also to be
precise just like the English words [laws?].

1056
01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:00,307
If you are precise, it comes out.

1057
01:16:00,587 --> 01:16:04,474
If you are not precise then you try this,
you try that, it won’t work out.

1058
01:16:04,569 --> 01:16:14,395
But if you have a photograph of My hands you
should ask the person to see the photograph

1059
01:16:14,464 --> 01:16:15,060
of the hand.

1060
01:16:16,069 --> 01:16:22,453
By seeing the light, gradually the person
will start seeing the hand, and then gradually

1061
01:16:22,478 --> 01:16:23,478
the person will become alright.

1062
01:16:23,663 --> 01:16:27,178
I’ve seen one person getting the eyes within
ten minutes time.

1063
01:16:29,772 --> 01:16:34,165
But in that, if the Left Swadhishthana is
catching, if the person has no diabetes and

1064
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:39,371
eyes are open, then it is definitely a bhoot,
nothing else.

1065
01:16:39,565 --> 01:16:43,746
Even if some people might say, “She lost
her eyes because of, this girl lost her eyes

1066
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:45,090
because there was a fire in the house."

1067
01:16:45,596 --> 01:16:48,955
But she got frightened and the bhoots sat
in here and she became blind.

1068
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:50,025
They are connected both things.

1069
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:53,545
Actually eyes cannot remain open if the eyes
are burned out.

1070
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:57,804
So if the eyes are open and absolutely normal
to look at and the person cannot see, the

1071
01:16:57,829 --> 01:16:59,947
light is out, that means there’s a bhoot.

1072
01:17:01,696 --> 01:17:04,603
So these things can be very easily done.

1073
01:17:04,628 --> 01:17:10,076
Sahaja Yogini [in Hindi]: How do you do it?

1074
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:13,588
Shri Mataji: Photograph like this, and the
light in front.

1075
01:17:13,677 --> 01:17:15,649
It will improve your eyesight also.

1076
01:17:15,674 --> 01:17:19,996
My hands should be used, very good for the
eyes.

1077
01:17:20,074 --> 01:17:23,811
My hands are extremely good for your eyes.

1078
01:17:23,836 --> 01:17:29,221
If you can see My hands with the light, very
good for your eyes.

1079
01:17:30,622 --> 01:17:35,459
Now what are good My feet for?

1080
01:17:52,707 --> 01:17:53,940
Sahaja Yogi: Agnya.

1081
01:17:55,781 --> 01:17:58,175
Shri Mataji: Very good for ego.

1082
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:02,248
And also superego.

1083
01:18:03,082 --> 01:18:07,630
Is very good for people who suffer from ego
or superego, My feet.

1084
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,169
Because, such people are very gross.

1085
01:18:11,289 --> 01:18:15,167
And the feet solve the problem.

1086
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,445
So just use My feet.

1087
01:18:17,533 --> 01:18:22,181
If they see My Face, the ego will start working,
“This face is like that, it should be like

1088
01:18:22,253 --> 01:18:24,211
that – this, that."

1089
01:18:24,339 --> 01:18:26,974
Superego might give problems.

1090
01:18:27,164 --> 01:18:30,296
Even supraconscious will give you problems.

1091
01:18:30,321 --> 01:18:37,925
But feet, even if you are supraconscious,
they’ll correct your problems.

1092
01:18:38,877 --> 01:18:48,632
Feet are not only powerful but they go up
to the grossest point where you are.

1093
01:18:50,779 --> 01:18:55,747
[...] some sort of a man, you just

1094
01:18:56,415 --> 01:19:00,008
use My Feet, he’ll be alright.

1095
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,199
Face won’t work for him.

1096
01:19:04,779 --> 01:19:06,517
Face is for the seekers.

1097
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:16,972
But for all such people who are absolutely
incorrigible type, feet is the best.

1098
01:19:17,293 --> 01:19:22,006
Those who have extreme ego, those who have
extreme superego – extreme.

1099
01:19:23,219 --> 01:19:24,576
Feet are very important.

1100
01:19:24,901 --> 01:19:27,273
You also sometimes watch My feet.

1101
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:30,072
That’s a very good way, exercise.

1102
01:19:30,489 --> 01:19:33,632
Just watch My Feet to get rid of your grossness.

1103
01:19:35,918 --> 01:19:38,039
Just watch with your eyes.

1104
01:19:38,064 --> 01:19:42,536
How are you going to watch through your Sahastrara?

1105
01:19:42,958 --> 01:19:47,115
(laughter) But also with Sahastrara you can
see.

1106
01:20:01,633 --> 01:20:06,334
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, do You think if we used
Your feet in the photo in the newspaper advertising

1107
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:07,359
we’d get more people?

1108
01:20:07,384 --> 01:20:08,576
Shri Mataji: Will be better idea.

1109
01:20:08,601 --> 01:20:09,884
Sahaja Yogi: We’ll try that.

1110
01:20:09,918 --> 01:20:11,650
Shri Mataji: But you see I don’t know.

1111
01:20:13,903 --> 01:20:14,537
(laughter) Try.

1112
01:20:14,562 --> 01:20:15,898
Very good idea.

1113
01:20:15,923 --> 01:20:18,057
You see on My books and all that we have tried.

1114
01:20:18,082 --> 01:20:20,947
On so many things I have tried, put My feet.

1115
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:23,490
Indians understand it.

1116
01:20:25,381 --> 01:20:29,908
Sahaja Yogi: Do you think they’d understand
in the US?

1117
01:20:29,933 --> 01:20:32,867
Sahaja Yogi: Well, you don’t have to say
Your name in the same thing.

1118
01:20:32,892 --> 01:20:34,759
Shri Mataji: Let’s put My feet.

1119
01:20:34,784 --> 01:20:35,964
Sahaja Yogi: Will just let it work through.

1120
01:20:36,127 --> 01:20:40,211
We’ll put Sahaja Yoga, we won’t say anything
about Whose feet they are.

1121
01:20:40,303 --> 01:20:41,525
Shri Mataji: Try.

1122
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:43,049
It is very good.

1123
01:20:43,429 --> 01:20:45,240
They’re tremendous.

1124
01:20:46,556 --> 01:20:48,905
See all the lights reacting.

1125
01:21:05,912 --> 01:21:28,754
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

1126
01:21:28,778 --> 01:21:30,778
You see?

1127
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:36,416
[Some yogis start rubbing Shri Mataji’s
feet.]

1128
01:22:32,875 --> 01:22:34,314
Putting on the feet.

1129
01:22:34,339 --> 01:22:36,430
Come bring it here.

1130
01:22:36,615 --> 01:22:40,741
I would like to give him there, alright, give
him there so he can do it better.

1131
01:22:40,766 --> 01:22:47,146
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

1132
01:22:50,263 --> 01:22:51,288
Mmm.

1133
01:22:52,206 --> 01:22:53,661
See the face.

1134
01:22:56,478 --> 01:22:59,121
Now give chance to others also.

1135
01:22:59,146 --> 01:23:00,476
May God bless you.

1136
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,476
Come along.
