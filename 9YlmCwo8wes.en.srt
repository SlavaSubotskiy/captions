1
00:00:52,591 --> 00:01:01,295
Today we are celebrating the day

2
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:06,683
which is a very, very important issue,

3
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:12,514
absolutely the most important, we can say, day,

4
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:19,113
when such a great happening took place.

5
00:01:20,426 --> 00:01:27,543
And it had to take place that way

6
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:32,017
because all in a way was that strict.

7
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:47,909
In My last lectures I have told you how Christ was created,

8
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:54,047
first in the heavens.

9
00:01:56,376 --> 00:02:01,714
In the Devi Mahatmya, if you read that,

10
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:06,292
He was created as Mahavishnu

11
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:11,745
and is mentioned very clearly, that first

12
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:16,270
He was created as an egg.

13
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:18,668
It is written in this book,

14
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:24,198
which perhaps was written about 14,000 years back.

15
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:30,120
It’s a book that predicts about Christ,

16
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:35,214
and that is why people in the West, specially,

17
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:38,972
offer an egg to each other as a friend.

18
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:45,164
So first the existence came on this Earth as an egg, that was Christ,

19
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:54,283
and part of it was kept in that stage

20
00:02:54,484 --> 00:03:02,257
and the rest of it was used by the Holy Ghost,

21
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:10,339
by Mahalakshmi, to create Christ out of it.

22
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:16,300
In that ancient book He was called as Mahavishnu;

23
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:19,558
means the greater form of Vishnu.

24
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,816
But actually Vishnu is the father

25
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:28,871
and He is the Son created by the Holy Ghost.

26
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:31,628
After my lecture I would like, if you have the book,

27
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:39,249
to read it out to them, the whole texts of how Christ was created.

28
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:50,197
And when He was created He cried for his Father,

29
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:54,689
as He cried also on the cross once.

30
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:01,030
And He cried for years.

31
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,162
And then Christ, in Mahavishnu state was blessed by His Father

32
00:04:09,363 --> 00:04:14,412
who said that Your position will be placed higher than Mine

33
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:18,382
and You will be the Adhara; means the “Support of the Universe.”

34
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:24,769
See, how from Mooladhara He becomes the Adhara.

35
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:32,502
This was all done at the heavenly stage –

36
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:37,080
Vaikuntha stage you can say.

37
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:43,143
Then He was given birth by the Holy Ghost,

38
00:04:43,344 --> 00:04:48,432
who was the mother of Christ on this Earth

39
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:52,908
who was nobody else but was the incarnation of Mahalakshmi;

40
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:56,035
means She was Radha. Ra-dha.

41
00:04:56,236 --> 00:05:02,118
“Ra” means energy, “dha” means the one who sustains energy.

42
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:12,199
There are many aspects of Easter one has to understand,

43
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,754
but the most of all is why did He die

44
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:18,904
and why was He resurrected?

45
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:24,076
This point I have not yet touched, perhaps, so clearly.

46
00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:27,584
That’s the point I want to tell you today.

47
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:32,296
It’s only you people can understand the importance of the life of Christ.

48
00:05:32,496 --> 00:05:37,920
And when it is said that you have to get

49
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:41,186
your realization through Christ,

50
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:46,741
it means that He had to pierce through the Agnya Chakra.

51
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:49,300
He had to be there.

52
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:52,301
If He had not created this gap in the gate

53
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:58,113
we could never have got realization.

54
00:05:58,314 --> 00:06:04,949
That is why it is said that you are to pass through

55
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:13,984
the gates of heaven only with the grace of Christ.

56
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:17,445
Of course that doesn’t mean churches, it doesn’t mean at all churches.

57
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,224
That you understand as Sahaja Yogis

58
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:21,231
that you have to pass through the Agnya Chakra.

59
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:23,348
Ultimately that’s the most difficult point

60
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:26,308
where human beings have to pass.

61
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:28,732
Because, at the Agnya Chakra,

62
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:34,295
your ego and superego are fully grown.

63
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:38,748
At the human stage only this ego is developed.

64
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:43,326
Now how to overcome the ego was a point.

65
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:50,527
And to overcome the ego, Christ had to do this.

66
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:58,596
When He was created in the beginning as Shri Ganesha –

67
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:07,384
you know the story how He was created – that the mala

68
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:16,697
is the from the body of Parvati, the Holy Ghost,

69
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:21,767
was taken out because before Her marriage

70
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:24,768
She was –

71
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:32,497
She had to cover Herself for Her bath with many scented things.

72
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:35,528
And it was taken out, all these things

73
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:37,723
and Her vibrations came out.

74
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,733
And She created this child just to protect Her chastity;

75
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:44,311
outside Her bathroom She put him.

76
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:47,639
And you know the whole story about it.

77
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,686
Now there was a part of the element of the earth in that child.

78
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:57,577
pruthivee-tattwa, was there.

79
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,869
All other centers –

80
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:08,727
all other centers have got some elements in that.

81
00:08:09,484 --> 00:08:15,197
Some elements like pruthivee-tattwa is there, earth element;

82
00:08:15,398 --> 00:08:20,322
then you have got water element, then you have got air element,

83
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:26,470
and when you come to this it is the light element,

84
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:30,353
it’s the light.

85
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:36,111
And at this point, at Agnya Chakra,

86
00:08:36,312 --> 00:08:42,127
He had to cross the last element, that was the light element.

87
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:44,791
That means He had to come out

88
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:52,744
into the true form of only the Divine Power, the Omkara,

89
00:08:52,945 --> 00:09:03,203
the vibrations you can call it; or the absolute…

90
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:06,812
you call it logos or something like that? The first sound,

91
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:11,695
Brahma. So He had to become the principle of Brahma.

92
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:15,260
To become the principle of Brahma, He had to get rid of

93
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,626
all other elements within Him.

94
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:22,189
So the last was also the light element,

95
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,072
which He had to cross through.

96
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:30,283
So He had earth element in Him, as He was of the mala

97
00:09:30,484 --> 00:09:35,478
and all other elements within Him. But when it comes to the Agnya,

98
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,335
He had to give up all the elements, that He had to die

99
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:42,356
the death of all these elements that were within Him,

100
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:48,656
to become complete, absolutely pure, Spirit.

101
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:56,939
What He did on subtle form works out on the gross form

102
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,259
and to do that He had to die.

103
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,790
And whatever died in Him,

104
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:08,206
was that little element of earth element and other elements,

105
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:15,320
and what came out of Him was pure Spirit.

106
00:10:16,297 --> 00:10:21,252
Was pure Spirit that was resurrected; the pure Spirit,

107
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:28,457
the pure Brahma-Tattwa which had formed the body of Christ,

108
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:32,978
which was the body of Christ.

109
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,748
And this happening came –

110
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:47,531
Christ has done what was predicted about Him –

111
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:54,420
that He’s a savior, because He passed through that gate

112
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:59,803
to take people from this bodily existence,

113
00:11:00,004 --> 00:11:06,217
means the one that depends on the elements,

114
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:10,061
to that existence which is Spirit.

115
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:15,499
So the resurrection is where you become,

116
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:22,382
from your attention, you jump into the attention of the Spirit.

117
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:29,843
When you feel your attention, when you become the Spirit,

118
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:38,172
that is the happening which has happened to you also.

119
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:42,664
But He became pure Spirit, pure Brahma Tattwa

120
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:45,102
when He was resurrected,

121
00:11:45,303 --> 00:11:54,660
and the resurrection is a happening of the Divine Power

122
00:11:54,861 --> 00:12:02,500
which came from Mooladhara Chakra as just earth element,

123
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:06,852
started growing. It took its birth from there,

124
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:13,805
came up to Agnya chakra. There Christ was created

125
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:17,164
to pass through all the elements,

126
00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:22,633
ultimately to enter into the Sahasrara

127
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:29,024
to become a complete Brahma Tattwa.

128
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:33,376
And this was a very difficult thing,

129
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:39,907
was very experimental.

130
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:46,419
And the experiment was quite a dangerous one.

131
00:12:47,374 --> 00:12:51,314
It could have failed also,

132
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:56,970
because He had in Him that human element,

133
00:12:57,171 --> 00:13:01,749
the body element which suffered.

134
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:08,103
And He suffered, because this body element suffers,

135
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:13,221
not the Spirit; Spirit does not suffer. The body element suffers.

136
00:13:13,422 --> 00:13:17,268
So He had to suffer that body element

137
00:13:17,469 --> 00:13:25,106
and to get over it, to get out of it,

138
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:36,947
and to get out of it He had to have a tremendous courage.

139
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:43,871
It was such a difficult operation.

140
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:47,676
Without Him nobody could have achieved.

141
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:50,903
He knew it was predestined,

142
00:13:51,104 --> 00:13:58,714
but it was one of the most difficult things to happen.

143
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:05,139
I wonder how many Christians know the significance of an egg.

144
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:13,361
Now egg signifies a stage where you are before realization,

145
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,221
when you are in your egg shell;

146
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,914
that you are Mr. X; you are Mrs. Y; all that.

147
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:27,102
But when you mature fully inside the bird is ready

148
00:14:27,303 --> 00:14:30,688
and that is the time you are hatched.

149
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:34,477
This is the time you get twice born.

150
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:39,360
So, actually the resurrection of Christ signifies that

151
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:45,235
and that’s why we give that egg to people saying,

152
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:47,564
“You are an egg,” a reminder of that,

153
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:52,227
“and this egg can become the spirit.”

154
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:56,641
And also it is written that it was an egg when He came.

155
00:14:56,842 --> 00:15:01,765
First He was created as an egg. Half of it remained

156
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:08,273
as Shri Ganesha and half of it became Mahavishnu.

157
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,992
Then He came on this earth

158
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:14,398
and He departed with all His elements

159
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:19,218
and the pure vibrations formed His body,

160
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:27,421
and He remained there within all of you to be awakened,

161
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:35,345
and when the Kundalini takes your attention through that point,

162
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:39,638
there you also become the Spirit.

163
00:15:40,484 --> 00:15:45,314
That’s why He said, that “I am the gate, I am the door.”

164
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:50,259
He didn’t say, “I’m the destination.” He said, “I’m the door,”

165
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,986
because you cannot become Christ.

166
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,242
That’s why he didn’t say, “I’m the destination,”

167
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:57,895
that you have to achieve Him,

168
00:15:58,095 --> 00:16:03,457
but He has created this space for you.

169
00:16:03,658 --> 00:16:09,196
You can become spiritually awakened;

170
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:15,001
you can become your Spirit. But Christ is an incarnation,

171
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:20,377
He was the Son of God. And so He’s an incarnation,

172
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:23,315
and that incarnation came on this earth

173
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:27,799
just to pull you out of your elements,

174
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,313
to make you become the Spirit.

175
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:39,282
Now how is it that it was the most difficult thing?

176
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:43,805
Because human beings had created in their heads

177
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:48,703
all kinds of artificial barriers; you see whatever we think

178
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:52,485
and whatever we do with our mind is all dead, is man made,

179
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:54,765
is artificial,

180
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:58,851
Because reality’s beyond your mind;

181
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:03,094
it is not in your mind. You cannot conceive it; you cannot hold it.

182
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:08,656
Whatever is in your mind is not the reality, it is beyond.

183
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:14,828
So, for a human being to accept something that is beyond mind

184
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:18,137
had become so difficult at the time of Christ because of Romans

185
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,010
and all these people coming up.

186
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,884
And we are repeating the history again.

187
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,485
They were so ego-oriented, they were so full of ego

188
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:30,665
that to destroy their ego

189
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:36,944
somebody had to do this to create a passage.

190
00:17:37,944 --> 00:17:40,712
By His death so many things are proved,

191
00:17:40,913 --> 00:17:45,220
that all those who crucified Him were stupid people,

192
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:47,721
they were ego-oriented, they were blind.

193
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:51,126
They could not see what He was.

194
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:56,853
They could not see what a genuine personality He was.

195
00:17:57,054 --> 00:18:01,280
They crucified Him.

196
00:18:02,785 --> 00:18:06,162
I mean it’s the greatest stupidity.

197
00:18:06,363 --> 00:18:10,420
And they crucified Him, it was all known because these people

198
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:13,250
were so stupid that they would have only crucified him,

199
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:15,001
what else they could do?

200
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:17,285
Because they couldn’t bear with their little egos,

201
00:18:17,486 --> 00:18:23,019
somebody who is so simple, who is so genuine, who is so true.

202
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,777
So they crucified Him

203
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:31,949
and that crucifixion came as a breakthrough for us.

204
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,183
But message for us is the resurrection part.

205
00:18:36,384 --> 00:18:41,449
Message for us is the resurrection and not crucifixion.

206
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,543
Crucifixion is not the message, because He’s done for us.

207
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:51,181
This is the point where Jews must understand.

208
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:55,801
The other day I was reading – today only –

209
00:18:56,002 --> 00:19:04,003
some discussion with the Archbishop of Canterbury took place.

210
00:19:04,204 --> 00:19:08,745
And the fellow who was asking him was asking him questions

211
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:13,508
as if he was asking questions to God.

212
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:18,753
In a way he said so also that, “I would ask this question to God,

213
00:19:18,953 --> 00:19:22,461
that, ‘Why is it so many Jews were killed?’”

214
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,320
They asked for it.

215
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:29,709
They wanted that they must suffer

216
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,330
because they wouldn’t give the credit of suffering to Christ.

217
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:36,940
They thought, "We all have to suffer." Ego. It's ego.

218
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:43,025
"How dare anybody suffer for us? We must suffer separately."

219
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:47,565
They couldn't give that credit to Christ and all the

220
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:52,901
later thinking was that, "We must suffer."

221
00:19:53,102 --> 00:20:01,173
So, whatever you think comes into action on this gross level,

222
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:06,608
so Mr. Hitler was born and he made them suffer.

223
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:16,114
And the stupidity of human beings

224
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:20,184
is responsible for all the problems

225
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,450
that are created on this earth.

226
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:26,404
The other question was, "How the children get leukemia?"

227
00:20:26,604 --> 00:20:28,440
He would ask God, "How children get it?"

228
00:20:28,657 --> 00:20:34,397
If the parents are so frantic and speedy, children have to get it.

229
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:40,174
If you are not relaxed person when you are married

230
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,613
and when you are going to have a baby;

231
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:45,730
you are thinking of divorces and all sorts of nonsense,

232
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,207
that franticness will work on the child.

233
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:51,520
Psychologically it is a left side problem and the child has to be

234
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,050
a patient of leukemia as soon as he's born.

235
00:20:56,251 --> 00:21:00,594
That is what it is.

236
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:08,181
So the problems are created by human beings

237
00:21:08,382 --> 00:21:10,954
because of their stupidity.

238
00:21:11,155 --> 00:21:13,962
There is no problem that God has created for you.

239
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:17,563
He's solved all your problems. All your problems He solves;

240
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:19,020
you have seen in Sahaj Yoga

241
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,786
how He solves your little, little problems even.

242
00:21:21,986 --> 00:21:27,676
But we create problem for ourselves by our stupidity,

243
00:21:27,877 --> 00:21:33,682
by our addiction to elements,

244
00:21:33,883 --> 00:21:38,000
to material things,

245
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:43,914
to material habits. Matter sits on our head.

246
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:58,303
That is on the, we can say, on the level of the earth element.

247
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:04,336
Then we have other problems like emotional attachments:

248
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:08,044
"This is my daughter; this is my child; this my; this is mine;

249
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:12,501
I'm so attached to my child."

250
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:19,301
Then, "This is my country. This is your country."

251
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:21,725
We create problem. This Falkland camp...

252
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:26,904
this Falkland this thing is an artificial problem, you can see that.

253
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:30,097
I mean, when these people went there, these spaniards,

254
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:32,903
They all should been given back to Spain.

255
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:37,799
And all from Brasil should be given back to Portugal.

256
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,549
What are they doing there? If this is the situation.

257
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,409
But they are all human beings.

258
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:46,526
What is this territory business?

259
00:22:46,726 --> 00:22:50,120
So let the human beings live happily wherever they are.

260
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,997
What are they going to get out of this territory?

261
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:57,587
God never created Argentina, Chile, England and all that,

262
00:22:57,788 --> 00:23:01,150
He created one homogeneous structure,

263
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:05,284
and it is to look after each other. Like a heart is created,

264
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:09,642
a liver is created, a brain is created, a nose is created.

265
00:23:09,843 --> 00:23:14,650
If they start fighting, say this eye starts fighting this eye.

266
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:20,194
We laugh, but we human beings do the same thing.

267
00:23:21,148 --> 00:23:23,548
We are all the time doing like this.

268
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:29,869
This is the stupidity of human beings, which is creating problem.

269
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,979
And when you become very stupid,

270
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:34,596
somebody horrible takes advantage of that

271
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:39,337
and comes on this earth just like Hitler,

272
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:43,155
and he tries to put you right.

273
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,197
You don't need all that. You need only wisdom

274
00:23:47,398 --> 00:23:50,002
and your realization.

275
00:23:50,203 --> 00:23:54,112
And that is what is done today that you have got realization.

276
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:57,237
So Easter for Sahaj Yogis all over the world,

277
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:00,853
is the most important happening

278
00:24:01,054 --> 00:24:04,978
because if it had not happened it would not have been possible

279
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:09,272
to give realization to people.

280
00:24:12,312 --> 00:24:15,752
I think Gavin will read it out to you later on about

281
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:18,390
what is written about Christ in Devi Mahatmya.

282
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:23,281
This book was written about 14,000 years back by Markandeya.

283
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:27,656
So imagine 14,000 years back he knew, being a seer,

284
00:24:27,857 --> 00:24:31,547
just like Blake, what was going to happen

285
00:24:31,748 --> 00:24:33,789
when Christ was to come.

286
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,664
But He was called as Mahavishnu.

287
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:41,177
He was not Vishnu, He was the son of Vishnu.

288
00:24:43,295 --> 00:24:49,844
And how many Christians understand this about Easter.

289
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:51,922
They don't. They - It's -

290
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,016
Christianity today is nothing but a mental activity that's all,

291
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:57,204
which is dead; nonsense it is.

292
00:24:57,405 --> 00:24:59,350
Just like any other nonsensical religion,

293
00:24:59,551 --> 00:25:02,998
it has become another foolish, stupid religion,

294
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:06,079
which has no meaning. Unless and until you get your realization,

295
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,313
unless and until you feel the vibrations,

296
00:25:08,514 --> 00:25:11,407
unless and until you feel this Divine Surrounding Power,

297
00:25:11,608 --> 00:25:13,202
how will you understand?

298
00:25:13,403 --> 00:25:15,304
Because that's the only thing that is truth;

299
00:25:15,505 --> 00:25:18,359
that's the only thing that is reality,

300
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,968
and unless and until you achieve it, how will you know about Christ?

301
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:25,734
And fighting about Him; how can you fight?

302
00:25:25,935 --> 00:25:27,406
I can't understand really.

303
00:25:27,622 --> 00:25:32,911
To Me, it's stupidity gone to another extreme.

304
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:36,664
By this thing, what you do actually,

305
00:25:36,865 --> 00:25:40,195
is to use all these great incarnations to kill each other.

306
00:25:40,396 --> 00:25:44,812
Can you imagine? The things that came to elevate you,

307
00:25:45,013 --> 00:25:48,179
to make you into higher living are now used,

308
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,788
the same things, the names are used to kill each other,

309
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:54,913
to bring down each other. At the most,

310
00:25:55,114 --> 00:25:57,186
if you reach a point where you don't understand,

311
00:25:57,387 --> 00:26:01,069
then they start saying, "It's a mystery."

312
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,592
What is the mystery, in Sahaj Yoga there's no mystery.

313
00:26:04,793 --> 00:26:09,069
It's all just there.

314
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,590
To Me, human beings are a mystery.

315
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:18,645
I don't understand them. I can't understand.

316
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:25,598
The resurrection of Christ has to now be collective resurrection.

317
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:33,011
This is what is Maha Yoga. Has to be the collective resurrection

318
00:26:33,212 --> 00:26:35,566
and for this collective resurrection,

319
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:40,207
first of all Sahaj Yogis must decide to be collective.

320
00:26:40,408 --> 00:26:43,809
Because through Kundalini awakening you cross,

321
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,215
no doubt, you cross through,

322
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:52,676
but you enter an area of collectivity.

323
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:58,434
And if you do not allow that collectivy to permeate into you,

324
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:01,145
then you come down.

325
00:27:01,346 --> 00:27:07,043
Supposing you become a state beyond the element,

326
00:27:07,244 --> 00:27:10,629
the state where you are a collective being;

327
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,324
you're aware of the collective being;

328
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:16,894
you're aware that you are a part and parcel of the whole;

329
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:21,511
you're aware that you have to help your nose and your eyes

330
00:27:21,712 --> 00:27:24,183
because you are part and parcel of the whole.

331
00:27:24,384 --> 00:27:27,105
You reach that stage where you understand that,

332
00:27:27,306 --> 00:27:30,121
"I am as important as other cells are,

333
00:27:30,322 --> 00:27:32,376
and other cells are to be helped by me

334
00:27:32,577 --> 00:27:34,118
and they have to sustain me, we are one."

335
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,595
There should be complete concord.

336
00:27:36,796 --> 00:27:39,775
This awareness comes after realization

337
00:27:39,976 --> 00:27:44,916
and if you do not understand that this awareness,

338
00:27:45,117 --> 00:27:47,400
that this collective awareness

339
00:27:47,601 --> 00:27:50,603
is the only way you can stay in that area.

340
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:53,369
Otherwise you get out.

341
00:27:53,570 --> 00:28:03,398
You start having your smaller wells and you just go down into them.

342
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:09,510
The more you start to expand yourself, you rise higher

343
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:14,408
and then you are again with your badhas or whatever it is.

344
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:19,119
But if you think that, "I have to live for the whole.

345
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,650
I'm responsible for the whole.

346
00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:29,524
I'm responsible for creating a nucleus of a cell,

347
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:32,508
which is going to look after the whole,

348
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:35,531
and if I fall down the rest also suffers.

349
00:28:35,732 --> 00:28:37,523
I have no business to fall down

350
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:40,937
because I have been resurrected to this point.

351
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:45,695
I have entered into the state of collectivity,

352
00:28:45,896 --> 00:28:48,445
where my being, which is the Spirit,

353
00:28:48,646 --> 00:28:52,039
is the collective being and I have to stay there,

354
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,153
I have to be there; I cannot fall, it's not the way I can live."

355
00:28:58,354 --> 00:29:00,833
But I have seen after realization also,

356
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:06,700
people cannot get out of their shells. They still remain in the shell.

357
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:11,856
They cannot spread their wings and sing

358
00:29:12,057 --> 00:29:18,067
and get out of their shell and just fly. They cannot do it.

359
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:21,751
They still stick on to their small ways of life,

360
00:29:21,952 --> 00:29:26,642
in a smaller ways, in every way. In a holiday you go.

361
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:29,540
You want to have a separate holiday. Why?

362
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:34,673
This is the holiday time, holy-day as they say. Holy day.

363
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:38,122
This is the holy-day. When you are with other Sahaja Yogis

364
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:40,724
you are really enjoying a holiday.

365
00:29:40,925 --> 00:29:44,544
Where do you enjoy your holiday otherwise? Which is the other way?

366
00:29:44,745 --> 00:29:48,909
To be with them is the real holiday.

367
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,458
And that is why one should understand

368
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,888
that you should expand your collectivity.

369
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:58,442
If you do not expand your collectivity you are just a waste.

370
00:29:58,643 --> 00:30:02,981
You are a wasteful creation of Sahaj Yogis,

371
00:30:03,182 --> 00:30:06,825
which I'm sorry to say, will go down.

372
00:30:07,026 --> 00:30:09,177
Such people show also, in the beginning,

373
00:30:09,378 --> 00:30:13,630
gradually they start getting better and better and better.

374
00:30:13,831 --> 00:30:15,724
And once you are there in full state

375
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:17,318
you really enjoy each other's company

376
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,201
without having any fears about them,

377
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:21,599
without having any possessiveness about them,

378
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,115
without having any kind of expectation,

379
00:30:24,316 --> 00:30:29,287
but just enjoying each other.

380
00:30:29,488 --> 00:30:34,490
That has to happen. Lies... All our cells in our body are like that.

381
00:30:34,691 --> 00:30:37,381
If they can do it, why not we?

382
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:42,342
Because we have so much of sense;

383
00:30:42,543 --> 00:30:46,194
at least we think we have more sense than the cells have.

384
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:49,097
At least it is expected, because we have evolved so much

385
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:51,964
from unicell to this state.

386
00:30:52,165 --> 00:30:56,593
And then you are the epitome of God's creation;

387
00:30:56,794 --> 00:31:00,187
you are the topmost people. Then why not?

388
00:31:00,388 --> 00:31:03,507
When you are resurrected the first thing that should happen to you

389
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:07,288
is to understand that you are no more an individual,

390
00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:11,561
but you are a collective being. You are no more an individual.

391
00:31:11,762 --> 00:31:18,334
All things which make you circumcise your individuality -

392
00:31:18,535 --> 00:31:21,748
throw that away.

393
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:25,693
You're no more an individual. All problems which come to you

394
00:31:25,894 --> 00:31:34,229
as individual problems are absolutely useless, false, wasteful.

395
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:39,396
Think of the collective problems. I enjoy such people.

396
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:44,943
Like the other day Fergie was anxious to know about Bristol -

397
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:46,552
which points are there,

398
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:50,361
which are giving vibrations from the Mother Earth.

399
00:31:50,562 --> 00:31:53,662
He's worried about the whole of Bristol - all the Jamaicans,

400
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:59,256
then about the whole British people,

401
00:31:59,457 --> 00:32:01,279
and then of the whole world you should be.

402
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,451
That's what one should think. One should not think,

403
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:06,717
"How will my daughter get married?

404
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:09,014
How can I get a ticket to go there?"

405
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:11,756
All these nonsensical ideas should be given up

406
00:32:11,957 --> 00:32:14,959
because you are now entered into the Kingdom of God

407
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,225
and He's going to look after you.

408
00:32:18,426 --> 00:32:20,561
Because that state you establish within yourself

409
00:32:20,762 --> 00:32:23,155
that you are a collective being.

410
00:32:23,356 --> 00:32:25,108
All other things will drop out.

411
00:32:25,317 --> 00:32:26,897
Gradually everybody will be molded.

412
00:32:27,098 --> 00:32:32,030
Even the most difficult I have seen, have improved.

413
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:35,428
But what about you, the one who is improving everybody else,

414
00:32:35,629 --> 00:32:38,436
what about you? How far you are there?

415
00:32:38,637 --> 00:32:41,655
How far in your faith that you know that,

416
00:32:41,856 --> 00:32:44,983
"I have entered into the Kingdom of God

417
00:32:45,184 --> 00:32:51,303
and that every action mine is looked after and guided by His power

418
00:32:51,504 --> 00:32:52,537
and I'm aware of it.

419
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:56,576
I'm aware that I have entered into the Kingdom of God

420
00:32:56,777 --> 00:32:59,654
which is expressed through my collectivity."

421
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:05,222
So collectivity is the nature of a Sahaj Yogi.

422
00:33:05,832 --> 00:33:08,975
And that's what one has to realize.

423
00:33:09,176 --> 00:33:12,397
May God bless you.

424
00:33:12,598 --> 00:33:17,577
Is it all right now? Just time.

425
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:26,561
How I manage, without looking at the watch?
