1
00:00:08,078 --> 00:00:14,358
Today we have gathered here

2
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:20,611
to worship Shri Krishna.

3
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:24,971
We must understand the significance

4
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:29,091
of Shri Krishna's advent

5
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:32,851
on the Vishuddhi Chakra.

6
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:41,731
As you know very well, except for once or twice,

7
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:57,451
Shri Brahmadeva has taken his incarnation.

8
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:06,211
Also once Shri Ganesha has taken His birth

9
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:09,611
as Lord Jesus Christ.

10
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:14,291
But Vishnu Tattwa, the principle of Vishnu,

11
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:19,611
has taken many a times birth on this earth,

12
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:24,131
as the Goddess had to take many a times Her birth.

13
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:29,691
They had to work together many a times,

14
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:38,051
and with the principle of Vishnu,

15
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,651
the principle of Mahalakshmi has acted

16
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,051
to help the ascent of the people.

17
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:54,531
So the principle of Vishnu is for your ascent,

18
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:59,131
for the evolutionary process of human beings.

19
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:04,611
Through this advent

20
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:08,771
and through the power of Mahalakshmi,

21
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:18,451
we have become human beings from amoeba stage.

22
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:26,851
This is a spontaneous working for us

23
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:31,171
but for the principle of Vishnu,

24
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:38,891
He had to go through various incarnations to evolve.

25
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:44,851
As you know there have been incarnations

26
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:49,571
of Shri Vishnu as a fish to begin with

27
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:58,331
and went on till it came to the state of Shri Krishna,

28
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:03,731
where they say that He has become complete.

29
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:08,491
But one has to realize that

30
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:12,291
He works on our central nervous system,

31
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:15,931
He builds our central nervous system.

32
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:18,331
Through our evolutionary process,

33
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:22,771
our central nervous system has been built up,

34
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:26,171
and this central nervous system has given us

35
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:29,891
all the human awareness that we have;

36
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:34,731
otherwise we would have been just like the stones.

37
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:38,611
But through this building up of our awareness,

38
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,371
one after another,

39
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:44,291
building up different chakras within us,

40
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:49,531
this principle of Vishnu has brought us to the understanding

41
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:53,251
that we have to seek the truth

42
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:58,251
and ultimately we have to become Sahaja Yogis.

43
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:01,051
So this principle of Shri Krishna

44
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:05,531
is so important that at the state,

45
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,811
as you call it the Vishuddhi chakra

46
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:11,851
we become complete,

47
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:18,571
in the sense that when the Sahasrara is opened out for you

48
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:21,811
and you start feeling the vibrations,

49
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,491
you are not yet fully complete.

50
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:31,371
If you were just complete then it would have been

51
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:39,211
an end of your evolution,

52
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:44,731
because at that stage, if you had finished it,

53
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:47,451
then there was no need to have Sahaja Yoga.

54
00:04:47,691 --> 00:04:52,451
But actually it means that once the Sahasrara is opened out,

55
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:56,011
then you have to come down to your Vishuddhi chakra,

56
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:58,811
that means to your collective.

57
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:03,691
If it is not working on your Vishuddhi chakra,

58
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:06,211
the enlightenment on Vishuddhi chakra,

59
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:08,131
you cannot feel the vibrations.

60
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:09,931
As you saw yesterday,

61
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:14,491
the artists started playing in a very new dimension.

62
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:17,971
It's not that only they got awakening of the Kundalini.

63
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:21,291
The awakening of the Kundalini was there, no doubt,

64
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:25,131
but it had to come down to their Vishuddhi chakra.

65
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:28,331
If I could not have brought it back to their Vishuddhi chakra,

66
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:30,931
their hands could not have moved that fast,

67
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,851
they would have never felt the sweetness,

68
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:36,171
the madhurya of Shri Krishna,

69
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:39,251
and they would not have manifested it.

70
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:44,971
So all that is expressed through your fingers and hands

71
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:50,291
achieves that new awareness of creating the madhurya,

72
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:52,091
the sweetness.

73
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:56,571
In your art, in your music,

74
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,731
in your gestures,

75
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:02,731
in every way, your hands are very important.

76
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:06,131
But Vishuddhi chakra also plays part, as you know,

77
00:06:06,371 --> 00:06:09,931
on the sixteen chakras or the sub-plexuses

78
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:13,331
which look after our face,

79
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:18,211
our ears, nose, eyes, neck,

80
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:23,091
all these things are looked after by Vishuddhi chakra.

81
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:28,451
As a result also, you can become great actors,

82
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:32,411
you can have eyes which are innocent,

83
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:35,931
you can have a skin which is shining,

84
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:40,651
you can have ears which can hear the Divine music,

85
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:46,851
you can have a nose which shows your dignity.

86
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:55,931
In the same way, your whole facial expression changes.

87
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,291
If you are a very harsh person

88
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:00,931
and a hot-tempered person

89
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:03,291
and you have harshness on your face,

90
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:06,371
or else if you are like a beggar all the time,

91
00:07:06,571 --> 00:07:08,371
or you are crying all the time, weeping,

92
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:10,451
your face looks so miserable,

93
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:13,411
everything changes and comes into the center,

94
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:19,371
where you look beautiful, you look attractive,

95
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:23,651
in the Divine way, and also you get

96
00:07:23,971 --> 00:07:30,211
a very sweet countenance.

97
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,051
Also the teeth and the tongue

98
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:36,931
are looked after by the Vishuddhi chakra.

99
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:43,011
So your teeth which are in trouble get cured.

100
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:44,971
You sometimes, as I told you

101
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:47,451
I have never been to a dentist all my life.

102
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:51,051
So you can imagine that you don't have to go to the dentist any more

103
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,371
if you have your Vishuddhi chakra all right.

104
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:57,611
Then also your tongue improves.

105
00:07:57,851 --> 00:08:02,171
For example some people are very sarcastic by temperament.

106
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:03,811
They cannot say something sweetly,

107
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:07,491
all the time they are sarcastic, saying sarcastic things.

108
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:11,651
Some people have a habit of abusive language.

109
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:18,931
Some people are extremely beggarish type,

110
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,691
all the time talking in a very beggarish manner.

111
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:24,691
There's no dignity, there's no sweetness

112
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,971
and there is no self-confidence for some people.

113
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:29,971
Some people even stammer,

114
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:33,371
some people cannot stand on the stage and give a lecture.

115
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:35,211
All these things drop out

116
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:38,331
as soon as your Vishuddhi chakra improves.

117
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:42,771
This is only outward, this is the outward manifestation

118
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:46,851
of the Vishuddhi chakra's improvement within yourself,

119
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:51,131
through the awakening of Shri Krishna on Vishuddhi chakra.

120
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:59,131
But what happens really is that, inside you, you become a witness.

121
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:03,331
You become a witness in the sense that all that is disturbing,

122
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:06,691
all that is troubling you, all that is a problem,

123
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:10,131
you just start watching it,

124
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:14,291
you start witnessing it, you start seeing it,

125
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:17,091
and you do not get disturbed.

126
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,691
That seeing, that witnessing state

127
00:09:19,931 --> 00:09:22,211
has a tremendous power.

128
00:09:22,451 --> 00:09:26,171
Whatever you see without thinking,

129
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:28,411
your problems get solved.

130
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:32,091
Any problem you have, once you get this witness state

131
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,931
- what you call 'tatasth'-

132
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:37,451
means you are standing on the shores

133
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:40,291
and so watching the waves to move -

134
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:43,091
then you know how to solve the problems.
