1
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:33,315
I had a special purpose in coming to Ganpatipule,

2
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,595
apart from that it was a very beautiful place
and very relaxing for all of you.

3
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:49,720
The reason is – I found this place had vibrations

4
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:54,083
which will clear you out very easily, first of all.

5
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:58,792
But you have to desire it, really, ardently.

6
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:03,074
You should have that desire otherwise the
Kundalini may not rise.

7
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:09,401
That is a very important point; that you have
to desire your ascent, nothing else.

8
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:16,075
It’s not a place you have come for a holiday
or just for some sort of a relaxation or for

9
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:26,626
some enjoyment or sleeping or anything, but
you have come here for a penance, for a tapasya,

10
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:31,555
to clear out yourself completely.

11
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:39,926
This is a place of Shri Ganesha’s temple
which is not very much frequented by people

12
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:41,506
and it’s still very, very pure.

13
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:48,966
And I thought that the Ganesh principle will
be awakened in you which is the source of

14
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:49,966
everything.

15
00:03:49,966 --> 00:04:01,856
Shri Ganesha’s principle, as you know, in
a very large way or expansive way, we call

16
00:04:01,856 --> 00:04:09,026
it ‘the innocence’, but we do not know
the intricacies and the details to which it

17
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:12,286
can go and work it out.

18
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:20,696
Shri Ganesha’s innocence has a tremendous
power to purify people, to make you holy,

19
00:04:20,696 --> 00:04:23,096
to make you auspicious.

20
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:28,556
A person who has got Shri Ganesha’s principle
awakened is auspicious in his presence.

21
00:04:28,556 --> 00:04:34,426
Such a person, whenever he moves, things move
in a direction that the coefficience works

22
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:44,176
out, it becomes absolutely auspicious; auspiciousness
which cannot be achieved without Shri Ganesha’s

23
00:04:44,176 --> 00:04:45,176
help.

24
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:50,596
Now this auspiciousness, now we Sahaja Yogis
believe into; that there is something like

25
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:55,556
auspiciousness by which everything works out
smoothly.

26
00:04:55,556 --> 00:05:03,376
Everything we feel is done by God’s power,
that we are all the time wanted by nature,

27
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:08,076
loved by surroundings and the atmosphere.

28
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:13,876
But this understanding can only come if you
have that pure desire within you, that you

29
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:14,876
have to ascend.

30
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:20,225
You have come here to ascend, not to enjoy
yourself or a place of resort or something

31
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:24,165
like that.

32
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:31,275
This principle is very much awakened, as you
see, in the local people here.

33
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:34,585
And how spartan they are, how hard working.

34
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:40,535
They’ve been awake for days together and
nights together but still they are very, very

35
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:45,245
relaxed and they do not need any help.

36
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,815
Just in that enthusiasm they are working out!

37
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:56,346
So the second blessing of Ganesha is that
He’s playful, He’s prasanna, He’s always

38
00:05:56,346 --> 00:05:57,876
a pleasing personality.

39
00:05:57,876 --> 00:05:59,695
He dances.

40
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:01,335
He pleases you.

41
00:06:01,335 --> 00:06:04,626
He has ways and methods of pleasing you.

42
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:11,656
And in the same way, a person who has that
awakened Ganesha within him is all the time

43
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:18,165
a very pleasing personality, not a drawn-out
face, not a face that repels you, the face

44
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:29,995
that makes you feel unhappy, but is a personality
that makes you very easy, very understandable,

45
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:35,486
likeable: that sort of a personality you develop.

46
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:43,305
But, so far as the life has been abroad, I
have seen that the situation has been very

47
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:44,305
different.

48
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:54,306
And the aggressiveness and the quarrelsomeness,
we can say, the hurting capacity, is so over-developed

49
00:06:54,306 --> 00:07:04,746
that you have to somehow or other, succumb
completely to the auspiciousness of Shri Ganesha.

50
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:10,866
Because all the instruments that were to be
used for spreading Sahaja Yoga or for spreading

51
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:17,425
the love of God, for spreading auspiciousness
of God, working out His designs and plans

52
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:26,336
and adjusting yourself to the laws of God’s
desires – it was very important that we

53
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:35,116
should have had our instruments done in such
a way that they were absolutely useful.

54
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:44,876
On the contrary we have misused them, spoiled
them and have completely made them unholy.

55
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:49,306
So that’s another point: we have to look
at ourselves here, what have we been doing

56
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:57,675
to ourselves, what is the need for us to make
ourselves unholy and why should we be unholy.

57
00:07:57,675 --> 00:08:02,885
When Shri Ganesha is there, we can make ourselves
very holy, auspicious.

58
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:04,976
Now no use believing that we are perfect!

59
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:08,026
Those who believe like that cannot ascend.

60
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:12,276
Everybody must know there are lots of imperfections
and, “These imperfections in me that are

61
00:08:12,276 --> 00:08:15,396
[there] should be conquered and [are] to be
found out."

62
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:18,696
Only in the light of Shri Ganesha’s innocence
you can see.

63
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:27,986
A little child can show you how we are stupid
and foolish and how we behave.

64
00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:33,265
So many times you must have seen [that] children
come out with such utterances that the elders

65
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:35,956
are put to shame!

66
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:46,485
So the child-like temperament can be developed
if we awaken the Shri Ganesha’s principle

67
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:54,146
within ourselves; which is a very, very powerful,
very, very powerful Deity.

68
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:58,355
A very powerful Deity.

69
00:08:58,355 --> 00:09:08,686
Because a child, supposing one child is lost,
say a child runs away or if a child is hanging

70
00:09:08,686 --> 00:09:15,975
somewhere on a tree – the whole community
will rush to take out the child, the concern

71
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:17,496
will be there.

72
00:09:17,496 --> 00:09:22,146
Even in the Western countries, I have seen,
if one little girl is tortured, everybody

73
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:25,385
is worried about the child, everybody opposes
that.

74
00:09:25,385 --> 00:09:31,556
Maybe there are some horrible people, no doubt,
maybe there are more than they are here, but

75
00:09:31,556 --> 00:09:33,366
one gets concerned.

76
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:46,116
So a child, itself, is a very sort of a source
of getting all the protection from everywhere.

77
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:50,336
Because the child is growing, the child is
growing.

78
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:53,066
Everybody wants to help the child.

79
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:58,616
So in the same way when this Ganesha principle
is developed into you, you realise that you

80
00:09:58,616 --> 00:10:01,135
have to grow, you are still growing.

81
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:07,985
A little child learns so many words in such
a short time that we cannot learn afterwards

82
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:08,985
when we are grown up.

83
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:14,776
Say, after sixty, if you have to learn even
three sentences, it’s impossible!

84
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:21,596
So the child is growing and his curiosity
and his capacity to know more things is also

85
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:26,165
very much sharp and he starts learning more.

86
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:27,455
He doesn’t think he knows everything.

87
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,846
The ones who think like that are not yet born
properly.

88
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:33,566
“I don’t know anything!

89
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,635
I have to know this, I have to know that.

90
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,635
I have to know that.

91
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:38,996
I don’t know anything so far."

92
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:42,105
And the children do it so easily you must
have seen.

93
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:50,755
A little bit you do this way or that way,
they immediately follow you.

94
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:56,116
So what you have to do is to know that you
are still in a child stage, you are growing.

95
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:59,966
We have to humble down and we have to know
a lot.

96
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:04,356
And from wherever we have to know, we have
to know.

97
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:11,906
The arrogance, the idea that we know a lot
itself is very, very dangerous for the growth,

98
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:13,686
very dangerous.

99
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:17,776
And that is what one has to give up and should
know that we do not know anything but we have

100
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:18,966
to know.

101
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:23,346
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga settle
down as, “We are Sahaja Yogis,” but don’t

102
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:24,966
know a word about Sahaja Yoga.

103
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:25,966
So many of them!

104
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:28,266
Specially the ladies, I am surprised.

105
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,346
They know very little about Sahaja Yoga.

106
00:11:30,346 --> 00:11:31,346
It’s rather surprising.

107
00:11:31,346 --> 00:11:36,036
Now in Sahaja Yoga there’s nothing like
women or men, everybody has equal rights.

108
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:38,716
It’s not the job of women just to sing songs.

109
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:39,716
No!

110
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:40,716
It’s not!

111
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:43,466
They have to know each and everything about
Sahaja Yoga.

112
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:47,766
They have to know what are the diseases, how
they are cured, what are the mental problems,

113
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:49,896
how are these chakras are made.

114
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:50,896
Everything they have to know.

115
00:11:50,896 --> 00:11:52,866
The medicines they have to know, the psychology.

116
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:55,606
They have to know the Divine powers.

117
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:59,596
Everything they have to know, how it works
out.

118
00:11:59,596 --> 00:12:03,815
And that ignorance will never be forgiven
because you are the ones who have to talk

119
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:06,696
about it to others.

120
00:12:06,696 --> 00:12:10,426
The third thing is: a child is never a silly
person, never silly.

121
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:13,346
He never does something in a silly way.

122
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:18,286
While you see many people who are brought
up in a very strict way become suddenly very

123
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:20,306
silly at an old age.

124
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,306
Very silly.

125
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:24,206
This phenomenon I see much more in the West.

126
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:31,446
Suddenly they become, trying to be very youngish-type
and just they’ll clap like this and start

127
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:33,185
behaving in a very funny manner.

128
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,485
I used to wonder, “What’s wrong with them?

129
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:37,346
Why are they behaving like this?”

130
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:39,756
But it is, I think they are bottled up.

131
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:42,826
And then suddenly they try to behave.

132
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,166
But they (children) are not.

133
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,016
A child is never a silly person.

134
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,216
On the contrary, if there’s somebody silly
they said, “He’s a clown!”

135
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:52,036
They’ll come and tell me, “He’s a clown,
you know.

136
00:12:52,036 --> 00:12:58,206
He’s not all right!” or, “He’s a buffoon!”

137
00:12:58,206 --> 00:12:59,206
Whatever words they know they’ll express.

138
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:00,815
They don’t like [it].

139
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:05,256
They start wondering, “What’s the matter
with this person?”

140
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:13,706
So all these things come to us because we
have no idea that we have to grow in a steady,

141
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:18,006
understanding awareness, awareness.

142
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:23,815
Not in how you express yourself in Sahaja
Yoga, how you do things in Sahaja Yoga.

143
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:30,256
It is how you are aware of it inside.

144
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:38,425
In the same way emotionally: when I say something,
I don’t think people understand what I mean.

145
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:40,086
Now I said that, “You put on bindis."

146
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:44,356
Again I find you are just the same!

147
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,886
At least here you should.

148
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:46,956
This is Ganesha’s mark.

149
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:49,876
They would not put it.

150
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:52,266
It’s so many times I have said it.

151
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:55,726
I mean, how much time does it take to put
it on?

152
00:13:55,726 --> 00:13:59,716
Now this is a very common things that are
going on.

153
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:05,166
Now another thing is that a child doesn’t
want to be dishevelled at all.

154
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,336
Today one child had gone for a bath and was
coming back.

155
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:11,916
His father wanted him to see me, he said,
“No, my clothes are not all right.

156
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,435
my hair are all dishevelled.

157
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,435
How can I see Mother?”

158
00:14:14,435 --> 00:14:19,506
So he went back, he put some oil on his hair,
properly he dressed up, smartly.

159
00:14:19,506 --> 00:14:24,776
When we were young, we always knew all the
Western people were very smartly dressed,

160
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:26,526
properly groomed.

161
00:14:26,526 --> 00:14:28,996
They would never come with dishevelled hairs.

162
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:33,136
But he said, “No, my hair [is] all dishevelled,
how can I go and see Mother?”

163
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:37,466
So we have to give up these funny ideas of
fashions and all that, because this will all

164
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:41,766
go away, you’ll lose your hair, you’ll
all become bald-headed to look very funny.

165
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:44,106
There’s no wisdom in it.

166
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:45,286
But a child has wisdom!

167
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:46,396
He wouldn’t come.

168
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:52,136
He dressed up himself properly, then he came
and stood before me.

169
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:58,516
And this is what we have to understand: that
our appearances are the expression of our

170
00:14:58,516 --> 00:15:04,295
inner being and we have to do certain things
because we do not know to accept things, how

171
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:06,336
to do things like a child does.

172
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:12,196
A child if you tell him anything, he obeys
and he listens.

173
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:14,935
Otherwise the child is not a normal child.

174
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:18,696
In India if there’s a child who doesn’t
obey, they just thrash him nicely, put him

175
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:24,816
in the room for three days, make him starve
and put him right; nothing doing!

176
00:15:24,816 --> 00:15:29,276
That doesn’t mean the people are harsh here
with children.

177
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,086
Nobody kills children or anything.

178
00:15:31,086 --> 00:15:35,555
But you have to be very, very careful with
your children, you shouldn’t allow them

179
00:15:35,555 --> 00:15:48,956
to be lousy, to be untidy, to be languid,
like lotus-eaters or like people who have

180
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:50,656
no smartness about them.

181
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:56,625
You are all Sahaja Yogis and you have to be
like that in that way.

182
00:15:56,625 --> 00:16:02,766
A child’s another attribute is that he hits
always the principle of everything.

183
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:05,125
Always the principle.

184
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,036
A child sees to the principle of everything.

185
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:13,086
And the questions they ask sometimes are so
remarkably collective that I am surprised

186
00:16:13,086 --> 00:16:16,156
how they go to that point.

187
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:19,756
They never waste time in frivolous things,
never.

188
00:16:19,756 --> 00:16:22,375
Never waste time in frivolous things, talking
of frivolous things.

189
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,375
Nothing of the kind.

190
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:28,925
I haven’t seen children talking about their
clothes or about the seats they have got or

191
00:16:28,925 --> 00:16:31,156
the houses – nothing of the kind.

192
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,756
They are busy doing some construction!

193
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:34,756
Very busy, you see.

194
00:16:34,756 --> 00:16:36,696
You ask them, “What are you doing?”

195
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:41,586
“You see, we are trying to tie up the whole
of the airport,” or the whole of Bombay,

196
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:42,815
like that they will tell you.

197
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:44,116
They are very busy people.

198
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:49,896
If you see Realised souls who are children,
they are always worried about the collective.

199
00:16:49,896 --> 00:16:54,516
And that’s what should be your situation
that you should be all the time worried about

200
00:16:54,516 --> 00:17:01,956
the collective as a child is: that, “How
I will help the collective?”

201
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:06,506
But not worried about yourself, “What is
my personality, am I that impressive?

202
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:08,726
If I go to people, will they believe that
I’m something?

203
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:09,726
A Realised-soul?

204
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:14,355
Or I am like other women or other men who
are going to the hairdressers and having all

205
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:20,276
kinds of hairdressing up and wearing all kinds
of funny dresses to impress others?

206
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:24,456
Am I looking like a saint?

207
00:17:24,456 --> 00:17:27,745
Am I behaving like a saint?”

208
00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:30,006
These things should come to you very easily.

209
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:39,065
If you tell a child, “You are a Sahaja Yogi,”
they say so, “I am a Sahaja Yogi, I can’t

210
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:40,545
do that way!”

211
00:17:40,545 --> 00:17:46,096
All the nonsense starts after they develop
their ego.

212
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:50,375
And then they start behaving in a funny way
and it develops much more in the West earlier,

213
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,176
but here it takes time.

214
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:58,495
And the children are just accepting whatever
God gives them.

215
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:02,466
To them alertness is so natural.

216
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:06,235
If there’s an aeroplane that’s going,
they’ll say, “Bye bye aeroplane."

217
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:08,076
Then there are ships are going, “Bye bye."

218
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:11,906
To the sea they’ll say, “All right, sea,
we’ll come and see you tomorrow!”

219
00:18:11,906 --> 00:18:13,065
Everything is within their mind.

220
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:14,685
To them everything is there.

221
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:18,305
They’ll come, you ask them, “How did you
like it?”

222
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,086
“Oh, we liked the grass very much.

223
00:18:20,086 --> 00:18:24,565
It was nice,” and everything they will tell
you, the details about everything.

224
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:26,485
So alert!

225
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:28,476
And then they will say, “Oh, Why didn’t
you do this?

226
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:31,986
You could have put some flowers here, you
could have done some flowers, would have looked

227
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,146
nice for the hut."

228
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:39,416
Or something, a suggestion they will give.

229
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,116
Very particular on cleanliness, anything.

230
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:43,526
And in childhood children get up very early.

231
00:18:43,526 --> 00:18:47,675
All the children in childhood get up very
early.

232
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:52,415
It’s a nuisance for mothers but they get
up very early and that’s how I also get

233
00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:54,096
up very early.

234
00:18:54,096 --> 00:18:56,065
Getting up early is a child-like behaviour.

235
00:18:56,065 --> 00:19:02,536
Because the birds are singing, the sun is
rising, such beauty in the sky and, “And

236
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:03,565
Why am I sleeping?”

237
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:05,576
They’ll wake up the whole house!

238
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:09,426
But people don’t like it, sometimes they
beat, not in India.

239
00:19:09,426 --> 00:19:11,555
In India people try to get up early in the
morning.

240
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:15,706
It’s regarded as something very dharmic
and good.

241
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:19,666
Even if we sleep late, we’ll get up early
in the morning, that’s one thing.

242
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,786
Then you can sleep in the daytime.

243
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:28,146
But nobody sleeps over this thing like nine
o’clock, ten o’clock, nobody sleeps like

244
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:29,146
that.

245
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:34,055
I mean, I have a problem, I don’t know what
to do with myself.

246
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:38,136
You can sleep in the daytime for a while if
you want to overcome the night sleep and all.

247
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,406
And you can be quite fresh.

248
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:44,095
And you can be quite all right in the evening
if you sleep for a while.

249
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:48,446
But a child doesn’t think too much, he doesn’t
plan too much.

250
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:50,225
He makes fun out of everything.

251
00:19:50,225 --> 00:19:53,056
You take them anywhere, say, you take them
to an airport.

252
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:54,646
There’s nothing to be played about [there]!

253
00:19:54,646 --> 00:19:58,715
They’ll find out some groove somewhere,
they’ll jump in that, they’ll hide there,

254
00:19:58,715 --> 00:19:59,715
play there.

255
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:04,455
They can make play out of any gross stuff
that we think is useless, they’ll make out

256
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:05,726
of it.

257
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:11,945
They’re very constructive and playful and
that is what we have to be, Make play out

258
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:12,945
of your life.

259
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:13,945
Everything!

260
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:19,026
You see, meeting people, talking to them:
it should come naturally, not artificially.

261
00:20:19,026 --> 00:20:22,396
Also some people, I have seen, have a habit
of putting up an expression all the time,

262
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:25,486
like a smile or a frown or this thing.

263
00:20:25,486 --> 00:20:27,345
Children are never like that.

264
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:28,726
Their muscles are so supple.

265
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:30,496
They react all the time.

266
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:35,526
Sometimes when they are happy, when they are
unhappy, everything.

267
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:39,356
The muscles all the time are acting like that.

268
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:40,356
Nobody is tense.

269
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:47,026
That’s why we have problems with our faces,
because we keep them in one style.

270
00:20:47,026 --> 00:20:51,416
And these days the more miserable, you are
regarded as more handsome!

271
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,956
That’s finished!

272
00:20:54,956 --> 00:20:58,756
Or else some people just go on smiling all
the time like this, it’s very bad.

273
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:01,226
Or all the time absolutely feeling unhappy.

274
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:11,546
You should allow the action of your emotions
to be expressed on your face.

275
00:21:11,546 --> 00:21:15,766
I am told that it is said that, “There should
be no emotions shown on your faces."

276
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:18,715
I mean, I can’t understand!

277
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:22,036
What is the use of such a personality who
doesn’t show any emotions?

278
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:25,706
I mean, you are not a stone are you?

279
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:31,156
So all these foolish, stupid ideas which are
given to us should be given up.

280
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:34,156
And we should smile, we should laugh, naturally.

281
00:21:34,156 --> 00:21:37,455
We should talk to people in a natural way.

282
00:21:37,455 --> 00:21:39,896
And the child is extremely dignified.

283
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:42,916
Shri Ganesha dances with His dignity.

284
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,646
He doesn’t do frivolous, nonsensical things.

285
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:55,896
In His rise and in His fall and in His movements
and His steps, He’s nothing but His weight.

286
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:58,066
So something cheapish He doesn’t do.

287
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,266
In the same way there should be dignity throughout.

288
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:03,726
Dignified behaviour should be within us.

289
00:22:03,726 --> 00:22:08,666
Now you have to judge yourself, how far you
have become Shri Ganesha within yourself.

290
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:09,835
Are you innocent?

291
00:22:09,835 --> 00:22:13,996
You think of cheating others, spoiling others.

292
00:22:13,996 --> 00:22:15,426
Like my television, I was amazed!

293
00:22:15,426 --> 00:22:19,666
I mean, I can never think of spoiling a television
and this and that.

294
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,156
These ideas, from where do they come into
your heads?

295
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:23,156
Why should we?

296
00:22:23,156 --> 00:22:27,276
I have never done it all my life, something
like that.

297
00:22:27,276 --> 00:22:30,396
You know that I have always paid every duty,
everything.

298
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:35,297
Why should we do such a nonsensical [thing],
to spoil the television and spoil it, make

299
00:22:35,297 --> 00:22:37,636
it look cheaper, for what?

300
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:40,796
How much are you going to save out of it?

301
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:44,446
But all these ideas come into your heads,
I just don’t know from where.

302
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,486
Why cheat?

303
00:22:45,486 --> 00:22:46,866
We are Sahaja Yogis.

304
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,345
We cannot cheat anyone.

305
00:22:48,345 --> 00:22:52,366
I mean, you can tell the customs, “This
is the situation is.

306
00:22:52,366 --> 00:22:55,335
If you allow we’ll go, otherwise we’ll
stay."

307
00:22:55,335 --> 00:22:58,705
It’s a negative attitude.

308
00:22:58,705 --> 00:22:59,716
Never comes to children.

309
00:22:59,716 --> 00:23:02,366
They are so plain and simple.

310
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:05,955
Once we had gone, I must tell you how children
are so simple.

311
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:15,116
Once we had gone inside a port and my nephew
gave me two tins of cheese and we were bringing

312
00:23:15,116 --> 00:23:16,396
it out.

313
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:21,815
So my daughter who was a very small girl,
so when we were coming and he asked, “Do

314
00:23:21,815 --> 00:23:22,815
you have anything?”

315
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:25,006
I said, “We have some two tins of cheese."

316
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:27,226
“Yes, yes and we’re going to eat it also.

317
00:23:27,226 --> 00:23:29,176
See we have opened one and we are eating!”

318
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:32,236
The customs fellow was so impressed by her
innocence.

319
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:34,046
He says, “For your eating?”

320
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:37,306
“Yes, yes for our eating, we have taken
it.

321
00:23:37,306 --> 00:23:38,496
Is it all right?”

322
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,016
He said, “It’s all right."

323
00:23:42,016 --> 00:23:49,695
You see, the simplicity and innocence is itself
a certificate for you,.

324
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:50,776
Not this cunning methods.

325
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:51,965
What is there?

326
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:56,256
I mean, precisely on the phone I tell them,
“Oh baba, for heaven’s sake!

327
00:23:56,256 --> 00:23:58,866
I’ll pay every duty, you don’t have to
do anything.

328
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:01,866
Just put this thing there, tell that it is
mine.

329
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:05,046
You don’t have to do anything.

330
00:24:05,046 --> 00:24:09,426
Declare it, this that."

331
00:24:09,426 --> 00:24:10,516
Why?

332
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:13,926
Where is our mind going?

333
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:16,666
It’s all right!

334
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,306
How much are we going to lose in there?

335
00:24:19,306 --> 00:24:21,445
How much have we gained so far in money?

336
00:24:21,445 --> 00:24:22,776
What do we have?

337
00:24:22,776 --> 00:24:26,846
Saving money here, saving money there.

338
00:24:26,846 --> 00:24:29,715
Children don’t do like that!

339
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:31,886
No, they don’t.

340
00:24:31,886 --> 00:24:38,986
Like my grandson, he was saying, “Why do
you stay in this wretched place?

341
00:24:38,986 --> 00:24:40,756
Very bad vibrations in London!”

342
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:45,496
I said, “You see, your grandfather has to
stay here for earning money."

343
00:24:45,496 --> 00:24:46,496
He said, “Money?

344
00:24:46,496 --> 00:24:50,345
Why do you need so much money for, why do
you need money, why don’t you come to India?”

345
00:24:50,345 --> 00:24:51,575
I said, “You need money."

346
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:55,476
So when my husband came back, he took out
a two-p, he said, “You want money?

347
00:24:55,476 --> 00:24:56,476
Have it!

348
00:24:56,476 --> 00:24:57,476
Now put it on your head!

349
00:24:57,476 --> 00:25:00,336
Why do you want to have money?”

350
00:25:00,336 --> 00:25:02,696
And my husband didn’t know where to look.

351
00:25:02,696 --> 00:25:05,046
“You want money, all right, have it, put
it on your head!”

352
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:10,126
He was a little boy, you see!

353
00:25:10,126 --> 00:25:12,286
But interest in money starts later on.

354
00:25:12,286 --> 00:25:18,496
As soon as there’s money we start looking
at it, when we grow up, otherwise we don’t.

355
00:25:18,496 --> 00:25:20,906
All this money interest starts going later
on.

356
00:25:20,906 --> 00:25:22,066
What is for Ganesha?

357
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:25,306
Money is the dust of His feet.

358
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:26,306
What for Him gold?

359
00:25:26,306 --> 00:25:27,966
What for Him anything?

360
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:32,345
Whether He wears a crown of gold or He doesn’t
wear anything makes no difference!

361
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:33,345
He’s is there!

362
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:35,036
His head is just the same.

363
00:25:35,036 --> 00:25:39,746
Out of respect, out of adoration, people might
give Him gold or anything just to feel satisfied,

364
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,746
it’s alright.

365
00:25:40,746 --> 00:25:44,336
For Him what does it matter?

366
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:51,026
And any child who is a real child will not
accept anything from anybody else, nothing.

367
00:25:51,026 --> 00:25:55,345
But if he takes, he will think, “How should
I return it back?”

368
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,345
Always!

369
00:25:56,345 --> 00:25:59,166
I know my own grandchildren have done it.

370
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:04,416
If you give them something, they’ll make
a heart, put inside that, write it down nicely

371
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:09,476
and when I come out of my bathroom, they’ll
give me that heart, you see, that, “Thank

372
00:26:09,476 --> 00:26:12,146
you very much,” for this and that.

373
00:26:12,146 --> 00:26:17,676
But when we grow up we even forget to thank
people, we take everything for granted, we

374
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:18,676
don’t have that.

375
00:26:18,676 --> 00:26:22,486
We just think we have to judge everyone all
the time, “That’s not good, this is not

376
00:26:22,486 --> 00:26:23,966
good, could have been better!”

377
00:26:23,966 --> 00:26:28,526
We never think, “This is given to us, be
thankful!”

378
00:26:28,526 --> 00:26:30,866
Count your blessings.

379
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:32,556
But for children it’s not so.

380
00:26:32,556 --> 00:26:38,936
If you give them a small thing, they’ll
keep it, “This is given to me by my grandmother!”

381
00:26:38,936 --> 00:26:43,325
I have seen this in my own grandchildren.

382
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:47,676
The eldest one when she was small I gave her
a little sari, a very small one just for her

383
00:26:47,676 --> 00:26:48,676
to wear.

384
00:26:48,676 --> 00:26:53,095
So when I went there she said, “You see,
nani, I must tell you one thing serious is

385
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:54,095
happening."

386
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:55,095
I said, “What?”

387
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:59,616
“You see, the sari you gave me, I’ve kept
it very carefully but my mother is trying

388
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:00,616
to be funny!”

389
00:27:00,616 --> 00:27:01,616
I said, “What happened?”

390
00:27:01,616 --> 00:27:05,056
“You know, she didn’t give it to anyone
but she showed it to some people, she should

391
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,476
not have shown it!”

392
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:08,136
Very seriously!

393
00:27:08,136 --> 00:27:14,036
They are so sweet and so beautiful when they
say things.

394
00:27:14,036 --> 00:27:19,626
Like once I had given her a Wendy house and
a Wendy house she made it nicely, she called

395
00:27:19,626 --> 00:27:23,286
her mother, “I have made a very nice house
for you, come along!”

396
00:27:23,286 --> 00:27:25,416
So my daughter is rather tall.

397
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:30,146
She found it difficult, she went inside the
Wendy house and sat there and she said, “Haa!

398
00:27:30,146 --> 00:27:31,585
So what have you got for me to eat?”

399
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:40,226
She said, “Mummy, when you go to somebody’s
house you don’t say such a thing!”

400
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:41,226
And she laughed.

401
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,486
And she laughed so much that she broke all
her Wendy house.

402
00:27:42,486 --> 00:27:49,066
So she came out and she told Me, “Grandma,
you have not given any good training to your

403
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:50,726
daughters!

404
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:54,595
First of all, she comes to my house, asks
funny questions and then she breaks my house,

405
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:59,236
do you do like this to anyone else?”

406
00:27:59,236 --> 00:28:03,835
How innocent and simple they are!

407
00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:06,666
Like that there are so many things I can tell
you [that] I have seen.

408
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:09,156
The way they talk and say things, and all
that.

409
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:16,815
So simple and so good and so collective and
so beautiful.

410
00:28:16,815 --> 00:28:18,956
In the same way we have to be.

411
00:28:18,956 --> 00:28:23,786
Another thing, a child doesn’t have any
fear.

412
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,095
A child doesn’t have any fear.

413
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:27,626
Ganesha has no fear at all.

414
00:28:27,626 --> 00:28:31,786
In the same way you should have no fear, no
fear at all, no fear.

415
00:28:31,786 --> 00:28:36,026
As long as your Mother is with you why should
you have any fear?

416
00:28:36,026 --> 00:28:37,756
Fear of this, fear of that, “I am frightened."

417
00:28:37,756 --> 00:28:39,156
“I can’t do this,” “I can’t do that."

418
00:28:39,156 --> 00:28:41,066
That children never do.

419
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:45,496
They’ll try everything, if you tell them.

420
00:28:45,496 --> 00:28:47,036
You should have no fear.

421
00:28:47,036 --> 00:28:52,376
I don’t know what fear is.

422
00:28:52,376 --> 00:28:56,246
In the same way you should have no fear, no
fear of anything.

423
00:28:56,246 --> 00:28:58,465
Nothing is going to go wrong with you.

424
00:28:58,465 --> 00:28:59,656
But don’t do wrong things.

425
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:03,656
If you do wrong things it will repel, it will
work out on you.

426
00:29:03,656 --> 00:29:09,286
But don’t do wrong things, be straight forward
and nothing can harm you, nothing can harm

427
00:29:09,286 --> 00:29:10,286
you.

428
00:29:10,286 --> 00:29:15,965
We have had so many experiences of this, how
everywhere laid down for you, everybody is

429
00:29:15,965 --> 00:29:17,646
looking after you.

430
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:20,696
There are so many Deities who are working
out things out for you.

431
00:29:20,696 --> 00:29:28,006
But you have to be, you have to be, extremely
careful that you do not develop this fear

432
00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:29,146
business.

433
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:33,176
Because fear takes you to the Left side and
once you go to the left side, you know the

434
00:29:33,176 --> 00:29:36,176
problems of the Left side is – first of
all -you go against Ganesha.

435
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:40,626
Ganesha is standing at the base of the Left.

436
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:45,736
And then you develop cancers, you develop
all these things, fear, fear, fear and emotional

437
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:47,935
problems and all these things come.

438
00:29:47,935 --> 00:29:51,955
In emotions you should be bubbling with joy.

439
00:29:51,955 --> 00:29:57,036
Joy is your emotion.

440
00:29:57,036 --> 00:30:03,085
In action you should be thoughtless.

441
00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:06,286
And in ascent you should be surrendered.

442
00:30:06,286 --> 00:30:12,226
That’s all, it’s very simple, three mantras
are very simple for children.

443
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:17,185
They are like that.

444
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:28,565
Today at the base of the Shri Ganesha’s
hill, we have to think of awakening the Ganesh

445
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:29,676
tattwa within us.

446
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:31,455
For that we have to meditate.

447
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,696
We have to think about it.

448
00:30:33,696 --> 00:30:36,856
We have to put our time to it.

449
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:42,955
Actually if I were you, I may not sleep at
all, I will go to the seashore, sit down there,

450
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:44,356
meditate the whole time!

451
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:49,758
Before breaking the Sahastrara I kept awake
for two nights and I was just all alone, all

452
00:30:49,758 --> 00:30:57,455
alone near the sea, all alone the whole night,
working it out, for two nights.

453
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,257
But what do we do?

454
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,986
We think about our comforts, we think about
this, about that.

455
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,156
It’s not so!

456
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:05,156
You are here!

457
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:07,736
Such a chance!

458
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:12,486
We get tired because we think too much.

459
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:18,516
We know how to get out of this tiredness and
this and that.

460
00:31:18,516 --> 00:31:21,526
So this is a very good chance for you [that]
we have come here.

461
00:31:21,526 --> 00:31:23,696
Of course it’s a beautiful place and all
that.

462
00:31:23,696 --> 00:31:28,356
But it’s mainly the thing why I thought
of bringing you here [is] that it may suddenly

463
00:31:28,356 --> 00:31:36,146
give you a big boost up and you might rise
very high; for which I may not be able to

464
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:44,876
really arrange otherwise, this kind of ascent
which is possible.

465
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:48,036
Many of the Indians have not even seen this
place before.

466
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:51,286
It’s such a beautiful place and they are
surprised that in India we have such beautiful

467
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:53,496
places!

468
00:31:53,496 --> 00:32:03,626
And after coming here they have felt the beauty,
the auspiciousness, the wisdom of choosing

469
00:32:03,626 --> 00:32:05,955
this place.

470
00:32:05,955 --> 00:32:09,776
It’s so lovable, so beautiful.

471
00:32:09,776 --> 00:32:16,766
But I hope I see the effects of that in you.

472
00:32:16,766 --> 00:32:19,226
Now you have to go and have your food.

473
00:32:19,226 --> 00:32:22,876
We have a very generous man who is cooking
for you.

474
00:32:22,876 --> 00:32:28,696
Be careful!

475
00:32:37,996 --> 00:32:41,796
You shouldn’t spoil your health!

476
00:32:41,816 --> 00:32:45,036
Specially for those who have to go with us
ahead.

477
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:46,055
So be careful!

478
00:32:46,055 --> 00:32:47,426
They’re very generous people.

479
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:51,946
My brother and the gentleman who is cooking
for you – both are competing in generosity.

480
00:32:51,946 --> 00:32:54,896
So you be careful!

481
00:32:54,906 --> 00:33:01,486
Now only the Sahaja Yogis from abroad and
non-vegetarians have to go first and then

482
00:33:01,486 --> 00:33:07,476
the vegetarians will go and after that we’ll
have some music program.

483
00:33:07,476 --> 00:33:09,856
That’s how it is going to be.

484
00:33:09,856 --> 00:33:16,866
Tomorrow morning I expect you to go for meditation
about five o’clock in the morning.

485
00:33:16,866 --> 00:33:19,606
Then have your bath in the sea.
