1
00:00:02,642 --> 00:00:07,238
Shri Fatima Puja, St Georges, Switzerland,
14 August 1988.

2
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:25,305
Today we have gathered to do the puja of Fatima Bi,

3
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:29,830
who was the symbol of Gruha Laxmi,

4
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:33,572
and so we are going to have the puja

5
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,203
of the Gruha Laxmi principle within us.

6
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:43,542
As the housewife has to finish every work,

7
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:47,547
everything in the household, and then she goes for a bath,

8
00:02:48,183 --> 00:02:52,147
in the same way this morning, I had to do lots of things

9
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:55,445
and then I could come for your puja,

10
00:02:55,803 --> 00:02:58,592
because today the house wife’s jobs were many.

11
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:02,491
So I had to finish them like a good house wife.

12
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:10,786
Now, the principle of Gruha Laxmi

13
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:16,857
has been evolved and developed by the Divine,

14
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:20,574
it’s not a human being’s creation

15
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:27,193
and as you know it resides in the Left Nabhi.

16
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:36,431
The Gruha Laxmi is the one that is represented in the life of Fatima

17
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:41,032
who was the daughter of Mohammed Saheb.

18
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,894
Now She is always born in a relationship

19
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:57,560
to a Guru, which is of virginity, of purity.

20
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,530
So She comes as sister or

21
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:04,946
She comes as a daughter.

22
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:11,055
Now the beauty of Fatima’s life is

23
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:15,941
that after the death of Mohammed Saheb,

24
00:04:17,662 --> 00:04:22,614
as usual, there were fanatic people who thought they can take

25
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:26,954
the religion into their hands

26
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:30,784
and can make it a very fanatic thing.

27
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:34,995
The attention was not paid so much

28
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,299
towards the ascent of the person.

29
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:43,645
Even Mohammed Saheb has described his son in law in many ways.

30
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,288
And He is the only one -

31
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:50,574
or there’s another incarnation- of Brahmadeva,

32
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:54,842
who came on this earth. Ali came on this earth,

33
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:57,159
He was the incarnation of Brahmadeva

34
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:02,458
and his - another incarnation was Sopandeva
 [brother of Jnaneshwara],

35
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:05,950
which, you can go to Pune,

36
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,013
you can see the temple of Sopandeva there.

37
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:46,480
So we have Ali and his wife Fatima

38
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:52,511
who incarnated on the principle of the Left Nabhi.

39
00:05:56,067 --> 00:06:00,465
She stayed in her house, in her household

40
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:05,026
and She observed what you call

41
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:09,409
a kind of a panda
 [? Pata: veil]

42
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:14,397
or niqab as they call it, to cover her face.

43
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:18,401
It is a symbol that a woman

44
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:24,262
who is a housewife has to

45
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:35,162
save her chastity by covering her face because

46
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:38,847
She was a beautiful woman and

47
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:46,531
They were born in a country which was very, very violent

48
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,473
and She would have been definitely attacked

49
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:55,008
in case She had not lived in that kind of fashion.

50
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:58,124
As you know, in the time of Christ,

51
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,722
though Mary was Mahalaxmi’s incarnation,

52
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:06,314
had to be very, very potential personality

53
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:10,866
and Christ did not want anybody to know what She was.

54
00:07:13,883 --> 00:07:17,231
But though She was in the house, She was Shakti,

55
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:24,047
so She allowed her sons

56
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:27,186
or actually ordered them

57
00:07:28,316 --> 00:07:30,699
to fight those fanatics

58
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:36,634
who were trying to deny the authority of her husband.

59
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:41,710
And you know that  Hasan and Hussain, they were killed there.

60
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:45,412
It’s a very beautiful thing how

61
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:48,918
the Mahalaxmi Tatva of Sita

62
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:53,032
took a form of Vishnumaya

63
00:07:56,125 --> 00:08:02,444
just to establish the beautiful principle of

64
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:09,143
a housewife.

65
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:14,123
Now, She was very powerful, no doubt,

66
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:17,930
and She knew that her children will be killed.

67
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:23,342
But these people are never killed,

68
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,757
they never die nor do they suffer.

69
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:30,419
It’s a drama they had to play to show people how stupid they are.

70
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:34,541
As a result of that,

71
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:42,033
another system started where they respected saints;

72
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:48,214
like in India Shiya people respect Auliyas

73
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:50,950
or we can call them the people

74
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:54,095
who are Realized souls like Nizamuddin Saheb.

75
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:58,519
Then we have got “Chisti”.

76
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:04,773
We have got, in Ajmer, Hajrat Chisti.

77
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:08,729
All these great Saints were respected by Shiyas.

78
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,464
But still they could not transcend

79
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:20,186
the limits of religiosity.

80
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,953
So they also became extremely fanatic.

81
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:30,775
Firstly they would not see to

82
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:34,994
another religion where they had saints.

83
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:39,405
They would not respect the saints who belonged to another religion

84
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,355
and even when we had a great saint

85
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:52,115
like Sai Nath of Shirdi, who was a Muslim to begin with,

86
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:59,054
and it is said that Fatima herself brought him

87
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:03,453
as a child in her lap and gave him to some lady.

88
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:09,395
We did not deny,

89
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,170
as far as Hindus were concerned,

90
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:18,000
his saintliness, but the Muslims did not accept it.

91
00:10:18,925 --> 00:10:22,465
There's another one who is called Haji Malang, who is very near

92
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:25,658
Bombay, who was a realised soul.

93
00:10:26,378 --> 00:10:31,578
He, too, realised the fanaticism of the Shias.

94
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:35,511
`Shia' word comes from Siya;

95
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:38,196
in U.P. Sita is called as Siya.

96
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:41,947
Sitaji is called as `Siya'.

97
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:49,188
They also did not realise that there are saints who are not,

98
00:10:50,037 --> 00:10:54,205
so called, Muslims but they are saints.

99
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:56,527
So they could not get out of it.

100
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,967
So we have another one called Haji Malang

101
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:03,715
who was worshipped by Hindus.

102
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,354
Some Muslims also go there, no doubt.

103
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:12,472
This Haji Malang

104
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:17,736
was quite worried about the fanaticism of the Shias,

105
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:22,154
so he appointed some Hindus to worship him,

106
00:11:22,703 --> 00:11:24,713
just to counter balance.

107
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:26,969
They did all kinds of things.

108
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,012
There are many saints like that.

109
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:37,121
I went to Bhopal. There is another big saint who was buried [there].

110
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:43,350
But his all disciples were just depending on the earnings

111
00:11:44,396 --> 00:11:46,961
of that place, which was very bad. Even

112
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:51,114
Hazrat Nizamuddin's things are the same way as the Hindus do.

113
00:11:51,805 --> 00:11:53,768
They all make an earnings,

114
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,365
I mean it's a kind of a commercial business.

115
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:04,510
So this saint died and was buried there.

116
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,165
There were many people who were depending on it.

117
00:12:07,313 --> 00:12:10,816
When I went there, I just, by the way, asked them,

118
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:13,986
 'What is your religion?'

119
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:16,388
So they said 'We are Muslims'.

120
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,993
I said what 'Was the religion of that saint who died?'

121
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:22,877
He said 'Saints have no religions.'

122
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:28,106
So I said 'Then why do you want to follow religion?
Why don't you follow his religion?'

123
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:30,209
They have no religions.

124
00:12:32,245 --> 00:12:36,284
Even, it is said, in Sanskrit,  the Sanyasis have no religions.

125
00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:40,148
They are dharmatita, they go beyond the religion.

126
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:43,678
But as it has happened with every incarnation,

127
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:47,466
it has happened even with the Shia people, with the Sunnis,

128
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:50,185
with the Hindus, with the Muslims and everyone,

129
00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:52,950
that they made a fanatic group.

130
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:58,135
Now fanaticism itself is absolutely against religion,

131
00:12:59,023 --> 00:13:02,381
against your innate religion within your-self

132
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:05,238
because it creates poison.

133
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,117
It's a venomous thing.

134
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:12,540
It makes you hate others.

135
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:15,609
When you start hating others,

136
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:19,659
then it reacts in you as horrible poison

137
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,395
which eats up all that is beautiful within you.

138
00:13:28,338 --> 00:13:30,451
Hating any one

139
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:34,644
is the worst thing that human beings can do, but they can do it.

140
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:38,146
They can do whatever they like.
Animals do not hate any one.

141
00:13:38,515 --> 00:13:40,969
Can you imagine? They don't know how to hate.

142
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,630
They bite some one because that is their nature.

143
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:46,404
They cut some one because that's their nature.

144
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:48,628
They never hate someone.

145
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:52,576
They may not like someone but this hatred, which is a poison,

146
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:57,946
is a speciality of human conception

147
00:13:58,154 --> 00:14:01,656
and human absorption. Only human beings can hate.

148
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:07,005
And this horrible thing hatred

149
00:14:08,236 --> 00:14:12,182
was settled between even the Muslims which was not done.

150
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:17,101
This Karbala was not created for hatred, but for love.

151
00:14:17,994 --> 00:14:22,424
Everything that was done for love was converted into hatred,

152
00:14:22,548 --> 00:14:24,895
in every religion.

153
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:29,282
Now the worst part of the whole thing is,

154
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:35,261
that one part which hates thinks the other part is the worst of all,

155
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:41,344
and the another part thinks that the first part is the worst of all.

156
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:47,184
Under what rule, law or logic they decide -

157
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:51,863
that is their own lookout. So they club together like that.

158
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:59,246
While this principle of the Gruhalakshmi was specially created

159
00:15:00,405 --> 00:15:03,079
to overcome that hatred,

160
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:08,497
to subdue that icy stuff called hatred,

161
00:15:09,044 --> 00:15:12,454
to remove, from the minds of the people, hatred -

162
00:15:12,672 --> 00:15:16,838
this Gruhalakshmi principle was created.

163
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:23,067
How? In the family when you have a household,

164
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,379
the Gruhalakshmi principle has to subdue the hatred

165
00:15:32,804 --> 00:15:39,331
between the children, between the husband and the children.

166
00:15:39,931 --> 00:15:44,575
But if she herself enjoys her hatred

167
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:48,160
then how can she subdue it?

168
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:53,378
She is the source of that peace which subdues hatred.

169
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,580
Now in India we have joint family [system], you too have

170
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:59,614
relations like uncles, aunties, this that.

171
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:05,280
But the housewife's job is to smooth

172
00:16:06,474 --> 00:16:13,662
smooth out all angularities of people which create friction.

173
00:16:17,345 --> 00:16:20,249
Now the man has to worship a housewife.

174
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:24,140
It is said so, 'Yatra Narya Pujyante, Tatra Ramante Devata'-

175
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,604
'wherever the housewife is respected,

176
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:31,180
there only the Gods reside'.

177
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:38,226
In our country, I, must say credit must go to the housewives

178
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:41,652
because we are no good for economics,

179
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:44,678
no good for politics, administration. Hopeless.

180
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,483
Men folk are useless,

181
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:49,429
they don't know any household work or anything,

182
00:16:49,557 --> 00:16:52,985
women have kept it to themselves, but our society is first class,

183
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:55,658
 is maintained by the women of the household.

184
00:16:58,035 --> 00:17:02,831
So the man has to respect the housewife, that's very important.

185
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:08,370
If he does not respect his housewife, there's no possibility

186
00:17:08,537 --> 00:17:11,865
of any Gruhalakshmi tattva being maintained.

187
00:17:13,402 --> 00:17:17,786
It's like the preservation of that

188
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,608
principle of a housewife.

189
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,774
But some men, I mean many of them,

190
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:34,445
think that it is their birth right to ill-treat their wives,

191
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:38,846
to torture them, to say all kinds of things,

192
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,454
to be angry,  if she is a good woman.

193
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,715
 But if she is a nagger, if she is a bhoot,

194
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:49,654
then they are subdued, completely subdued.

195
00:17:49,757 --> 00:17:53,791
If the wife is a bhoot then husband always, sort of,

196
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:58,892
tries to please her and be extremely kind to her.

197
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:02,023
He knows she is a bhoot, after all, you know, be careful

198
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,282
 [you] don't know what time the bhoot will come like a snake on you!

199
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,571
And if she knows how to nag or to argument,

200
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:13,963
then also they are afraid. There's no love,

201
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:16,388
they have no love or respect for each other

202
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:19,462
but they have an awe or fear.

203
00:18:21,219 --> 00:18:23,316
And they are afraid of such a woman.

204
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:28,469
Now some women think if they become flirtish then
 the husbands are better controlled.

205
00:18:30,472 --> 00:18:33,889
But their basic principle they lose.

206
00:18:34,702 --> 00:18:37,376
The basic shakti that they have, they lose,

207
00:18:39,888 --> 00:18:42,271
and they land up in difficulties.

208
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,142
So the basic principle of a Gruhalakshmi

209
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:49,715
 is to respect her chastity,

210
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:56,119
to respect her chastity outside, inside.

211
00:18:58,235 --> 00:18:59,863
That is the steadiness of her.

212
00:19:00,043 --> 00:19:02,998
Of course most of the men take advantage of it.

213
00:19:03,795 --> 00:19:08,449
If the wife is docile or obedient,

214
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:14,426
they make it a point that they just rule the wife, left and right.
 Alright!

215
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:20,375
 But this woman, the housewife,

216
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:25,174
has to know that she is not docile.

217
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:30,783
She is obedient to her own righteousness,

218
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:36,814
to her own virtues, to her own qualities.

219
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:41,129
If the husband is stupid, alright,

220
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,790
he's stupid like a child, finished!

221
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:47,453
But the husband has to know that he must

222
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:50,709
respect, otherwise he is a lost case, he's finished,

223
00:19:51,786 --> 00:19:53,790
he's good for nothing.

224
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:58,568
First thing is that he must see

225
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,476
that the woman in the household is respected as a Gruhalakshmi.

226
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:06,219
Then the blessings flow.

227
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:12,017
But in no way he should insult her

228
00:20:12,473 --> 00:20:15,447
 or be unkind to her

229
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:18,925
 and raise his voice or say things to her.

230
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:24,515
But the wife has to be the one who is to be respected.

231
00:20:25,543 --> 00:20:28,027
I have so many times said, your wife is dominating,

232
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,646
 give her two slaps on the face, of course, no doubt.

233
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:35,147
She has not to be dominating,

234
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:39,411
she has to remove the dominating forces of others.

235
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:42,536
She is the source of peace,

236
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:46,835
she is the source of joy

237
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,655
and she is the peacemaker.

238
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,316
If she is the one who creates problems,

239
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:57,661
then you can slap her nicely, bring her to her shape, is alright.

240
00:20:59,786 --> 00:21:03,296
 So this Gruhalakshmi tattva is mutual.

241
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:08,229
It doesn't depend only on the wife or husband but both of them.

242
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:13,727
So once if you are making your wife suffer,

243
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:17,833
your left Nabhi can never improve.

244
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:25,532
Or if you are a bad wife your left Nabhi cannot improve.

245
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,584
 Now in the west the problem with women

246
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,025
is this that they don't realise as to what is their power.

247
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:42,416
An eighty year old woman also would like to look like a bride.

248
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:48,016
 They do not feel their dignity
and enjoy their dignity within themselves.

249
00:21:48,302 --> 00:21:50,894
They are the queen of the house

250
00:21:51,648 --> 00:21:54,802
but they want to behave like [a] cheapish, childish,

251
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:57,088
young frivolous girl.

252
00:21:58,174 --> 00:22:01,880
They do not feel the dignity of their being,

253
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:06,108
they talk too much, they behave in a manner

254
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:11,082
that, does not behove a housewife.

255
00:22:11,257 --> 00:22:13,926
Like they'll take out their hands, talk like this,

256
00:22:14,426 --> 00:22:18,128
as the fisherwomen do, when they sell their fish to someone

257
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,306
and when they have to fight.

258
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:24,827
Or they shout sometimes, they shout also, I mean,

259
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:29,060
I heard they shout and sometimes they beat their husbands,
 that's the limit!

260
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,362
 They start always comparing themselves

261
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:38,986
with the husband, to begin with.

262
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:43,758
Like I am such a rich man's daughter,

263
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:47,443
I am from such and such family, my husband is from such a

264
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,988
low family he has no money,

265
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:52,633
nothing, he's not educated, so ill-treat him.

266
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:55,614
 Treat him in a manner that so no respect.

267
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:59,672
Such a woman will lose all her powers.

268
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:06,767
Also in her own ways

269
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:08,881
she will feel guilty,

270
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:13,138
she'll feel guilty because, first of all, nobody has right

271
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:17,284
to look down upon any one whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga specially.

272
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:25,008
Then, to look down upon your husband, is something unbelievable.

273
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:29,686
He may not be a Sahaja Yogi. Alright.

274
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:34,012
He may not be up to the point, but by your behaviour,

275
00:23:34,155 --> 00:23:37,528
by your strength, by everything

276
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:43,988
you can save him. But why are you losing yourself

277
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:50,503
by dominating others, by strangling others,

278
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:55,095
by making your husband a very, sort of a,

279
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:00,960
frog in the well.

280
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:05,943
Telling him, 'Oh, we both are after all we should enjoy.

281
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:07,650
Lets have our house separately,

282
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:10,843
nobody should come in the house'.
 Even a rat won't enter that house.

283
00:24:12,976 --> 00:24:17,975
Even to say, 'Oh, these are my children, my husband, myself',

284
00:24:19,827 --> 00:24:23,681
is the negative of Sahaja Yoga,

285
00:24:24,475 --> 00:24:27,241
is the negative form of understanding.

286
00:24:27,852 --> 00:24:31,602
These are absolutely absurd things,

287
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:36,294
they do not look like, of any Sahaja Yogi or any sahaja yogini.

288
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:40,759
 All this kind of selfishness,

289
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:45,817
all this kind of seclusion is against Sahaja Yoga.

290
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:51,173
But a thing of a housewife is,

291
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:54,802
'Oh, now how much should I prepare?'

292
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:58,847
 For example, 'There will be 50 persons coming.'

293
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,468
 So the husband says 'But only 10 are coming.

294
00:25:01,595 --> 00:25:03,928
Why do you want to have for 50 persons ?'

295
00:25:04,408 --> 00:25:06,928
 'But may be they would like to eat more.'

296
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:09,765
 'But then why do you have 50 plates?'

297
00:25:10,368 --> 00:25:12,751
 'Maybe they might bring there friends.'

298
00:25:13,307 --> 00:25:16,804
So she thinks of her generosity.

299
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,782
She enjoys her generosity.

300
00:25:19,449 --> 00:25:20,933
I have known many like that.

301
00:25:21,068 --> 00:25:23,972
 Though they are not even Sahaja Yoginis.

302
00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:28,516
They will say 'Will you come, sister in law,

303
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:30,492
 will you come for dinner?'  'Oh, I am not coming,

304
00:25:30,603 --> 00:25:32,770
 you cook too many things.' 'Not coming?

305
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,687
 No, no, I'll cook very few things but please come.'

306
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:37,866
Then she just start thinking immediately.

307
00:25:38,018 --> 00:25:40,925
'What vegetables are available in the market?

308
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:43,332
What should I get? What is the best?'

309
00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:48,339
 I mean, I am not their Guru, I am not their mother,

310
00:25:48,536 --> 00:25:50,760
I am just a relation,

311
00:25:51,603 --> 00:25:54,740
but they want to express their love through the food,

312
00:25:54,879 --> 00:25:59,792
they are the giver of food - Annadha . They are the Annapurnas

313
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:03,710
and this is one of  the quality,

314
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:06,210
 the generosity for woman doesn't have

315
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:09,810
she is not a sahaja yogini, by any chance. Take it from me.

316
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:15,071
Husband may be little miserly, doesn't matter,

317
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,919
but wife has to be very generous

318
00:26:20,062 --> 00:26:22,728
and sometimes, she secretly gives money,

319
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:27,210
not to her own children but to others.

320
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:33,535
Such beautiful women have to be there in Sahaja Yoga.

321
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:37,524
But I feel so sorry, sometimes

322
00:26:38,706 --> 00:26:42,416
that the attack comes from the women of Sahaja Yogi,

323
00:26:44,882 --> 00:26:48,121
not from the men, on me. I'm a woman myself,

324
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:53,468
and I feel shocked that women should attack me like this, for what?

325
00:26:56,817 --> 00:27:00,198
In Sahaja Yoga there is no domination of any kind

326
00:27:00,643 --> 00:27:04,940
 but all these so called ideas of servility or domination comes

327
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:10,455
from the false ideas you have, about your own dignity,

328
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:13,976
about your own understanding.

329
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:16,715
You are not aware of yourself.

330
00:27:18,078 --> 00:27:22,474
You do not know that you are the queen, nobody can dominate you.

331
00:27:22,979 --> 00:27:26,820
Who can dominate the lady, who rules the household?

332
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:32,494
If supposing the husband says, 'I don't like this colour!'

333
00:27:32,637 --> 00:27:34,359
  Alright, leave it for a while.

334
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:36,723
Then somebody will come and say 'What a nice colour!'

335
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:39,644
 'Ah, such a nice colour, oh, don't change it.'

336
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,413
The women must understand the men.

337
00:27:44,937 --> 00:27:48,478
 They have big eyes. They are not microscopic.

338
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:52,277
They see everything in a big way, you see.

339
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:56,804
So today they will say something, tomorrow they will forget about it

340
00:27:58,035 --> 00:27:59,750
and they don't have microscopic eyes.

341
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:01,710
They are too above these things.

342
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,997
They are above these things. You must understand that!

343
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:11,876
But if he sits on the horse, 'I must also sit on the horse
and fall down.

344
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,459
If he goes for skiing - I'll also go for skiing.

345
00:28:16,023 --> 00:28:19,614
If he develops his muscles - I'll also develop my muscles.'

346
00:28:21,588 --> 00:28:23,667
It is coming to that point.

347
00:28:24,048 --> 00:28:26,822
I mean women start looking like nothing on earth.

348
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:29,967
You don't know what sort of women these are with big, big muscles

349
00:28:30,071 --> 00:28:32,644
without any moustaches.

350
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,470
So this kind of stupid ideas we have.

351
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,386
But there is no subordination of any kind.

352
00:28:43,474 --> 00:28:45,832
You are subordinated to your own dignity,

353
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:49,271
to your own chastity, to your own sense of honour

354
00:28:49,663 --> 00:28:52,173
and, above all, to your righteousness

355
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:56,621
 because you are in charge of that. The man who is in charge,

356
00:28:58,476 --> 00:29:00,690
has to look after that side.

357
00:29:02,214 --> 00:29:03,916
How many quarrels you create?

358
00:29:04,068 --> 00:29:08,508
How can you be quarrelsome
when you are supposed to become the peacemaker?

359
00:29:08,722 --> 00:29:11,327
Supposing we send two peacemakers

360
00:29:11,653 --> 00:29:15,261
to some country to make peace and they cut each other's throat,

361
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,716
what will you say to such a thing?

362
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:23,706
You are the one who has to smooth down every thing,

363
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:29,227
you have  the one who has to bring such

364
00:29:30,613 --> 00:29:34,567
expression of love, such sweet things

365
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:43,584
that the family itself feels rested in you, secured

366
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,102
because you are the mother.

367
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,232
The family must feel secured within you

368
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:53,475
 and this love is your power.

369
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,577
 This is your power that you can give love

370
00:29:59,008 --> 00:30:03,455
and giving love you will find, you will always enrich yourself.

371
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:08,365
I mean imagine what presents I give compared to what I get.

372
00:30:08,468 --> 00:30:10,865
 I don't know I'll have to build another house!

373
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:13,303
I am telling them "Don't give me individual present.

374
00:30:13,406 --> 00:30:15,192
 I will not take any individual presents."

375
00:30:15,224 --> 00:30:17,900
Now still despite that. I don't know,

376
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:23,783
just with love if I get something with care, that love, you know,

377
00:30:25,002 --> 00:30:29,202
itself manifests and comes back to you like a poetry.

378
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:31,426
You are some times surprised.

379
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:37,409
 I'll give you one simple example of my own life

380
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:41,119
which will tell you how love can work it out.

381
00:30:41,738 --> 00:30:45,059
I was a housewife to begin with and to end with, I think.

382
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:48,016
And once I was in Delhi,

383
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:53,155
my daughter was to be born, so I was knitting something for her,

384
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,723
sitting outside in the lawn,

385
00:30:55,096 --> 00:30:58,830
 when three persons walked into the house, one lady and two men

386
00:30:59,188 --> 00:31:01,500
and they came and said, "See now we are...

387
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:05,121
housewife, I am a housewife and these two are,

388
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,911
one is my husband and he is the friend of my husband

389
00:31:08,078 --> 00:31:09,310
and he is a Muslim,

390
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:12,716
and we have come to you for shelter because we are refugees."

391
00:31:13,264 --> 00:31:15,517
I looked at them, they looked very good to Me,

392
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:16,827
 they were quite alright.

393
00:31:17,284 --> 00:31:20,422
I said, "Alright you please settle down in my house."

394
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,863
So I gave them the outside room which had a kitchen

395
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:25,048
and a bathroom and this thing,

396
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:27,695
and for the gentleman, I said, "There is another spare room,

397
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:30,084
you can stay there, and husband wife can stay here."

398
00:31:31,537 --> 00:31:33,462
In the evening my brother came in.

399
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:35,462
He started shouting at the top of his voice,

400
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:36,631
he said "What is this?

401
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:38,917
You don't know these people, they may be thieves,

402
00:31:39,139 --> 00:31:43,159
they may be this, they might do this...[UNCLEAR]

403
00:31:43,397 --> 00:31:45,047
my husband came, he also joined him

404
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:48,420
 because, you see, they were friends!
He told you

405
00:31:49,322 --> 00:31:51,440
All men just the same, you see,

406
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,674
so he said, "You see, she doesn't understand

407
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:55,707
she has kept these three persons here.

408
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:58,812
God knows, what they are, saying refugees, this thing.

409
00:31:58,924 --> 00:32:01,316
She doesn't know, he's a Muslim, he's a Hindu.

410
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:04,644
God knows, she's two husbands, one husband" like that,

411
00:32:04,771 --> 00:32:06,273
all kind of things.

412
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:09,857
Next morning they forgot about that.

413
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,296
I said "Alright. Let them be there for one night. Is alright?

414
00:32:13,836 --> 00:32:15,783
I can't drag them out today, one night."

415
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:18,382
Next morning they forgot that they where living there.

416
00:32:18,723 --> 00:32:19,804
That's like men!

417
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,868
First day, such a blasting, such a blasting,

418
00:32:21,987 --> 00:32:25,364
I said "Alright, one night. Now don't shout. They will feel hurt.

419
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,524
So let them stay one night, they'll be soothed down."

420
00:32:29,168 --> 00:32:31,553
Next morning they went away for their work.

421
00:32:31,656 --> 00:32:34,251
 They had no time. It was, you see,

422
00:32:34,363 --> 00:32:37,880
only on a weekend they become active in the household,

423
00:32:38,095 --> 00:32:41,224
otherwise they are inactive. So they went away.

424
00:32:42,364 --> 00:32:45,775
It so happened that these people stayed with me for one month.

425
00:32:46,144 --> 00:32:49,321
Then this lady got a job

426
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:55,859
and she went away with her husband and this Muslim.

427
00:32:56,145 --> 00:33:00,694
But in the meanwhile there was a big riot in Delhi, very big riot

428
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:07,915
Because many Hindus and Sikh people were killed in Punjab.

429
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:10,181
It had a reflection in Delhi

430
00:33:10,261 --> 00:33:12,594
and they started killing all the Muslims there.

431
00:33:13,027 --> 00:33:16,948
So, three, four Sikh people and one or two Hindus came to my house

432
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:20,738
and they said "We are told that you have a Muslim staying with you."

433
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,883
I said, "No. How can I have?"

434
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,538
They said, "There is a Muslim. We have to kill him."

435
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:28,723
I said "See I am wearing such a big teeka (bindi),
can you believe it

436
00:33:29,025 --> 00:33:31,235
that I could have a Muslim in the house?"

437
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:35,619
They thought I must be a real Hindu fanatic, you see!

438
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:42,143
So they believed me. I said, "See now,

439
00:33:42,262 --> 00:33:44,699
if you have to go in my house, you'll go on my dead body

440
00:33:44,818 --> 00:33:46,365
because I will not allow you!"

441
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,627
So they felt quite frightened. They went away.

442
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:53,614
So this fellow heard My things and he came and he said,

443
00:33:53,752 --> 00:33:55,659
"I'm surprised. How did you risk your life?"

444
00:33:55,755 --> 00:33:58,326
 I said, "There is nothing. Nothing."

445
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:00,098
His life was saved.

446
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:03,071
 Now this gentleman, this Muslim gentleman,

447
00:34:03,213 --> 00:34:06,206
became a great poet called Sahir Ludhianvi,

448
00:34:08,065 --> 00:34:10,689
and this lady became a great actress,

449
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,034
Kai nau ahe tenza?
(What is her name?)

450
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:15,716
 the one who used to act like a mother?

451
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,367
Ha, Sachadev, Achala Sachadev.

452
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:24,324
I knew it was, they had become one day and all that.

453
00:34:24,452 --> 00:34:26,292
But I didn't tell anybody about it.

454
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:29,661
I said "Now supposing they come to know, I am in Bombay,

455
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,633
they will just go mad about Me,"

456
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:33,926
and I said "I have no time for all that."

457
00:34:34,268 --> 00:34:39,075
So, we started a film centre for the young people,

458
00:34:39,158 --> 00:34:40,380
to give them some good films.

459
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:43,159
But it all made into a farce, later on.

460
00:34:43,388 --> 00:34:45,533
 They never listened to Me, but whatever it is.

461
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:50,305
So they said "We should get this Achala Sachadev to act as a mother"

462
00:34:50,623 --> 00:34:52,303
I said "Alright ,but don't tell her

463
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:54,525
 I have said, I have anything to do with it."

464
00:34:55,805 --> 00:35:00,904
So, years had passed, about I think about twelve  years or so.

465
00:35:02,965 --> 00:35:05,673
So they went and told her. So she was fussing like an actress.

466
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:08,461
"No, no - how much are you going to pay me? I cannot act free.

467
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:11,352
Everybody will ask for free. Then how can I give you free.

468
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,846
You will have to give me Sari.

469
00:35:12,934 --> 00:35:14,688
You'll have to give so much money. This thing."

470
00:35:14,765 --> 00:35:16,696
They said "Alright come to the muhurat at least.

471
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,539
Come to the muhurat", to the beginning,

472
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:21,436
 big muhurat is the one where you start it.

473
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:25,532
 So she came and I was there. She looked at Me

474
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,791
and just, you know, she couldn't believe

475
00:35:27,911 --> 00:35:29,579
 that she has seen Me after twelve years.

476
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:31,805
The tears starting swelling her eyes.

477
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,940
Absolutely she couldn't say anything, just she came and

478
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,546
fell into my arms

479
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,511
and she said "Where were you last all these days?

480
00:35:41,662 --> 00:35:43,664
I have been trying to trace you out."

481
00:35:43,928 --> 00:35:47,121
Then she started describing Me and all.

482
00:35:47,264 --> 00:35:50,052
Then Sahir Ludhianvi was there and he said,

483
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:53,308
"How this Lady is here?" They said, "This is Her work."

484
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:56,599
"Oh God, why didn't you tell us? You see,

485
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,400
we'll give our lives for Her!"

486
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,024
And they were all amazed, how they were changed.

487
00:36:01,136 --> 00:36:03,765
"No money, nothing, I am going to give money for this project.

488
00:36:03,979 --> 00:36:05,046
Nothing doing. "

489
00:36:05,275 --> 00:36:06,275
 See now,

490
00:36:06,683 --> 00:36:09,914
I was a housewife just an ordinary housewife.

491
00:36:10,224 --> 00:36:13,870
I didn't have so many rights on

492
00:36:14,692 --> 00:36:17,654
my husband's property, or anything,

493
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,918
and my brother another dominating fellow,

494
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:22,777
both of them put together,

495
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,414
just were about to kill me that night,

496
00:36:26,232 --> 00:36:29,268
with their temper and anger. I soothed them down

497
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,360
and then you know when I told my husband

498
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,599
and my brother, they were amazed.

499
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:37,268
I said, "They are the ones who have become like this

500
00:36:37,706 --> 00:36:39,214
 and see the change,

501
00:36:39,643 --> 00:36:41,980
how much they have...",

502
00:36:42,592 --> 00:36:45,262
and they said, "No more, we are going to say

503
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,200
no to any charitable institution.

504
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:49,233
This is the last mistake we have committed!"

505
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,420
And the whole idea of a...

506
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:59,520
earning and money just toppled down.

507
00:36:59,793 --> 00:37:03,038
And she has acted in many films for charity

508
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:08,378
and this Ludhianvi also wrote many things for charity.

509
00:37:11,304 --> 00:37:15,933
So a woman can make a man a charitable personality -

510
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,248
because she herself is charitable.

511
00:37:20,026 --> 00:37:22,663
She has so many beautiful..she's an artist!

512
00:37:23,946 --> 00:37:26,231
And she can create beauty around her,

513
00:37:26,552 --> 00:37:30,474
in her household, in her family, in her society.

514
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:32,477
Everywhere. But no!

515
00:37:32,646 --> 00:37:36,098
Women want to fight like men. They will have associations.

516
00:37:36,577 --> 00:37:41,382
They would have called that [UNCLEAR]

517
00:37:43,683 --> 00:37:45,255
 [UNCLEAR]

518
00:37:45,422 --> 00:37:49,406
unions, unions  they will like to have unions to fight for that.

519
00:37:52,795 --> 00:37:56,533
I agree that some of the men have been extremely cruel,

520
00:37:56,644 --> 00:37:59,727
some of the laws have been extremely cruel, this thing, that thing,

521
00:37:59,982 --> 00:38:02,373
and that they have to be told.

522
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:04,876
But this is not the way!

523
00:38:05,387 --> 00:38:10,894
 There is another way of improving these men, who try to

524
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:13,711
destroy the women,

525
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:18,920
because women have one very great quality that Ganas are with them

526
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:23,981
and Shri Ganapati is with them.

527
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:27,223
He will never side with men if they are chaste

528
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,457
and do not try to show off their body

529
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:33,290
 and show off their beauty and want to make,

530
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:35,827
sort of, a capital out of it.

531
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:42,635
Such women are extremely powerful,

532
00:38:44,123 --> 00:38:46,657
extremely powerful, and they show their valour

533
00:38:46,935 --> 00:38:48,461
when it comes to anything

534
00:38:48,612 --> 00:38:52,122
like we had Jhansi ki Rani. She was an ordinary housewife.

535
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,021
She fought the British.

536
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:55,968
And the British also

537
00:38:56,389 --> 00:38:58,645
were surprised at her valour and they said that

538
00:38:58,772 --> 00:39:00,369
we had got Jhansi, alright,

539
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:03,658
but the glory goes to the Queen of Jhansi.

540
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,188
Like that we had many, Noorjahan we had,

541
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:12,905
we had Ahilya Bai. We had many great women in India

542
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:16,487
because of these institutions. Padmini we had,

543
00:39:17,587 --> 00:39:20,407
Chand Bibi. There's so many women we can mention

544
00:39:20,614 --> 00:39:24,004
who have been great women, who were housewives.

545
00:39:27,383 --> 00:39:34,149
So the woman's qualities are like the potential of the mother earth

546
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,940
or potential of any energy.

547
00:39:36,091 --> 00:39:38,988
 Like electricity has its potential somewhere else.

548
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:41,443
You see the lights here, makes no difference,

549
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:44,922
 one light or two lights, but the potential is important.

550
00:39:46,123 --> 00:39:48,159
So one has to understand that we are potential

551
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:52,304
and to preserve our potential we must have the sense of dignity,

552
00:39:52,553 --> 00:39:55,370
honour and righteousness within ourselves.

553
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:59,201
Now men must respect their women who are like this.

554
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:01,608
 But men are another stupid stuff

555
00:40:01,974 --> 00:40:04,699
because they will not respect a woman

556
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:07,471
who loves them, who is chaste,

557
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:10,839
who is good, who wants them to become collective,

558
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:13,994
who wants them to give, who be charitable,

559
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,616
who wants that Sahaja Yoga should be promoted

560
00:40:17,768 --> 00:40:21,056
and the one who wants that her husband should be happy

561
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,268
and joyous and that he should come to Sahaja Yoga as well.

562
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:29,479
Instead of that they run after some funny, stupid women.

563
00:40:32,016 --> 00:40:37,280
 What is there to be so attracted towards bhootish women,

564
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:40,481
must be some bhoots in them, I don't know,

565
00:40:40,763 --> 00:40:42,215
that the way they get attracted.

566
00:40:42,747 --> 00:40:45,608
As a result of all this misbehaviour of men,

567
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,022
women become very insecure

568
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,010
and they get insecured. As a result,

569
00:40:51,217 --> 00:40:53,807
the men suffer and women suffer.

570
00:40:55,175 --> 00:40:58,453
A man who neglects his wife, and treats like that,

571
00:40:58,813 --> 00:41:03,902
will consequently get blood cancer.

572
00:41:11,923 --> 00:41:14,121
And the woman who behaves like this,

573
00:41:16,636 --> 00:41:21,026
in this manner and if she ill-treats

574
00:41:21,376 --> 00:41:24,791
her husband, will get asthma

575
00:41:25,397 --> 00:41:30,798
or of a very serious type of cirrhosis,

576
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:36,771
could be brain damage, could be paralysis,

577
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:41,389
could be complete dehydration of the body.

578
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:49,262
Because left nabhi is so important.

579
00:41:50,405 --> 00:41:53,698
If the left Nabhi is made hectic, as you know

580
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:58,565
by your running about and by jumping about and by being hectic,

581
00:41:59,281 --> 00:42:03,307
that left Nabhi becomes hectic and you develop blood cancer.

582
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,298
I have always seen

583
00:42:05,552 --> 00:42:09,845
 that the women who are thin, their husbands as jittery - why?

584
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,504
Because the wife is all the time making him run up and down.

585
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,006
"Do this, do that, you didn't bring this thing for me!

586
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,627
I had asked you to bring the Coca-cola you didn't bring!

587
00:42:19,815 --> 00:42:22,153
You didn't do that!" As if he's the sinner all the time.

588
00:42:22,733 --> 00:42:26,348
And the man becomes jumpy all the time, jumpy.

589
00:42:27,566 --> 00:42:30,742
He gets something for the jumping

590
00:42:30,984 --> 00:42:34,674
and she gets something for her torturing.

591
00:42:35,211 --> 00:42:39,663
There's no love. There's no joy. There's no happiness.

592
00:42:43,368 --> 00:42:45,704
This so-called figure madness,

593
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:49,476
which is now subsiding, thank God. It's coming from America now.

594
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:54,806
 It's subsiding. This figure madness makes you funny.

595
00:42:57,956 --> 00:43:00,574
Women have to be settled down women.

596
00:43:01,818 --> 00:43:03,818
They have to be Grahasthis,

597
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,541
that is, 'The one who settles in the household'.

598
00:43:06,806 --> 00:43:09,179
 Said to be satisfied with her household.

599
00:43:09,698 --> 00:43:11,612
If she is all the time running about,

600
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:13,296
 she doesn't want to stay in the house

601
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:17,609
then she is not a housewife, but she is a maid servant.

602
00:43:20,038 --> 00:43:24,816
There is a saying that there was a lady who was a maid servant,

603
00:43:25,046 --> 00:43:27,231
and then she was made a housewife

604
00:43:27,581 --> 00:43:29,647
but she could not stop her running about

605
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:31,743
because she was a maid servant.

606
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:35,536
She doesn't settle in the household.

607
00:43:35,814 --> 00:43:39,713
Now for whom is the household, is not only for herself,

608
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:43,185
No, not for her husband, no, not for her children

609
00:43:43,508 --> 00:43:45,603
but for others to welcome.

610
00:43:46,302 --> 00:43:49,321
Like this Mother Earth has spread all these beautiful things for you

611
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:51,765
 to come and sit and enjoy.

612
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,325
But is a very common thing, also that in Sahaja Yoga,

613
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:58,232
we find that people, after marriage,

614
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:02,633
become absolutely engrossed into each other and lose Sahaja Yoga.

615
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:07,775
Then their children suffer. Their children become fussy, funny

616
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:11,293
and disobedient, torturesome.

617
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:16,509
They have some physical problems also - is a punishment.

618
00:44:18,097 --> 00:44:19,617
Not that I punish this,

619
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:22,161
but it is your own nature that punishes - supposing you

620
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:25,212
put your hand in the fire, it will burn.

621
00:44:25,451 --> 00:44:28,466
I mean who is punishing? You are punishing yourself!

622
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:34,026
Then children become funny.

623
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,136
 Just for your family, just for your food,

624
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:41,764
just for your household, this selfishness,

625
00:44:43,004 --> 00:44:46,170
if it crawls up into man, then God save that family.

626
00:44:46,387 --> 00:44:49,314
If it's a woman, its alright, at least a little bit

627
00:44:49,783 --> 00:44:52,286
but if the man is a gone case,

628
00:44:55,938 --> 00:44:58,288
that I should have a house, I should have a job,

629
00:44:58,433 --> 00:45:01,779
I should look after my children, it's for my family.

630
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,801
Our family is not of one man one woman

631
00:45:08,161 --> 00:45:10,657
but the whole universe is our family.

632
00:45:13,037 --> 00:45:15,409
We are not on our own,

633
00:45:16,058 --> 00:45:19,535
 and if you become arbitrary, and if you become secluded.

634
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,046
I must tell you one thing and warn you today

635
00:45:23,444 --> 00:45:26,090
that-  those people who will try to seclude themselves,

636
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:27,892
a day will come,

637
00:45:28,094 --> 00:45:32,623
when they will have horrid diseases on them don't blame Sahaja Yoga!

638
00:45:33,453 --> 00:45:38,465
Sahaja Yoga has it's own beautiful realm of God's Kingdom.

639
00:45:38,573 --> 00:45:41,487
But in the God's Kingdom, you have to be collective.

640
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:48,640
But a bad wife can create problems because she's..[INAUDIBLE]

641
00:45:48,834 --> 00:45:52,621
and she'll create a problem she'll form a group of people,

642
00:45:52,738 --> 00:45:53,964
group of women,

643
00:45:54,189 --> 00:45:58,272
 she'll go on rolling down with her bhoots to everyone.

644
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:07,849
Or may be she's very conscious of her education

645
00:46:07,986 --> 00:46:11,613
may be conscious of her position or of her money and all that -

646
00:46:11,823 --> 00:46:15,386
then also she will try to keep the husband aloof.

647
00:46:19,307 --> 00:46:22,611
Such people have to pay for what they have done.

648
00:46:22,763 --> 00:46:26,051
Not because it is a punishment from God.

649
00:46:29,707 --> 00:46:33,206
 So Gruhalakshmi tattva in Sahaja Yoga is very important.

650
00:46:34,908 --> 00:46:39,753
Those people who have got problems after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

651
00:46:39,919 --> 00:46:43,857
most of them have neglected their Gruhalakshmi principle.

652
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:51,746
Because Gruhalakshmi, if it goes out, then centre heart catches.

653
00:46:54,139 --> 00:46:57,126
Those women who have tried such tricks,

654
00:46:58,012 --> 00:47:01,114
 should give up immediately because it's very indignified.

655
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,306
Nobody respects such a woman.

656
00:47:04,834 --> 00:47:08,022
It's very true with the leaders' wives and the leaders.

657
00:47:09,342 --> 00:47:11,620
The leader's wife or the leadership

658
00:47:11,736 --> 00:47:19,294
is a minimal of a minimal of a minimal  of a so-called position.

659
00:47:20,016 --> 00:47:22,006
Most insignificant.

660
00:47:24,298 --> 00:47:28,280
What you got is much higher than this.

661
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,196
If you ask a saint to become a king. He'll say, What?

662
00:47:35,807 --> 00:47:38,296
You want to put the ocean into a cup?

663
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:46,207
Is the minimal of minimal.

664
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,234
Is the lowest of lowest.

665
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:52,388
Those who think their life is service are another stupid people.

666
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:56,448
Their life is enjoyment, not service.

667
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:01,727
But that service itself is enjoyment.

668
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:04,870
 But if you just keep to service.

669
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:09,184
"Oh, I am sacrificing, this is my tapasya!" Finished!

670
00:48:10,228 --> 00:48:15,710
Then you end up like a tapasvi,
with like a beanstalk [figure] - thin.

671
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,515
You can be used for a cross!

672
00:48:23,682 --> 00:48:26,002
So, in Sahaja Yoga it is enjoyment but,

673
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:29,849
 unless and until you have that essence

674
00:48:29,976 --> 00:48:33,377
of enjoyment into everything, it cannot be an enjoyment.

675
00:48:35,317 --> 00:48:40,332
If you take out the essence from the cane sugar

676
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,498
or what you call the sugar cane bamboo,

677
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:47,787
then what is left?

678
00:48:48,867 --> 00:48:51,989
In the same way, all the so-called service

679
00:48:52,092 --> 00:48:54,467
and seva and tapasya

680
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,954
and all that has no sweetness in it,  finished.

681
00:48:59,974 --> 00:49:03,024
So the essence of all this is sweetness

682
00:49:04,594 --> 00:49:07,157
and that is generated by women.

683
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,553
But they are very strict. "Don't spoil this.

684
00:49:11,704 --> 00:49:13,649
Keep this nice, keep that nice."

685
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:17,200
The husband comes home like as if like a criminal, you know.

686
00:49:22,733 --> 00:49:26,153
He has to be like a bull in a china shop, he has to be.

687
00:49:27,207 --> 00:49:29,350
It's a good thing in a way.

688
00:49:30,557 --> 00:49:34,647
Is nice, how he doesn't know anything, is even better for you.

689
00:49:39,068 --> 00:49:41,276
But to make him all the time slave,

690
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,204
"Do this! You didn't do this for me! Do that for me!",

691
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:46,588
Is not the job of a housewife!

692
00:49:50,604 --> 00:49:55,831
Her job is like the Mother Earth. Does She complain?
Nothing.

693
00:49:57,069 --> 00:49:58,434
She gives you everything.

694
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:01,640
So much is the sustenance in [UNCLEAR]. So dignity.

695
00:50:02,218 --> 00:50:03,736
Such powers She has.

696
00:50:03,895 --> 00:50:06,816
What does She care for anybody giving her anything?

697
00:50:07,311 --> 00:50:10,979
 You will be amazed if I tell you today, till today, till yesterday,

698
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:14,800
I never asked my husband to buy me anything.

699
00:50:15,026 --> 00:50:19,448
For the first time I asked him to buy me a camera,

700
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:22,158
and you see the result, in the evening what he said.

701
00:50:22,365 --> 00:50:23,955
Least expected!

702
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,824
Never in life-time.

703
00:50:29,102 --> 00:50:31,113
He used to say, "You must tell me what you want".

704
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,406
First time, I said something and see the effect.

705
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:36,033
Because I've never said him!

706
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:42,119
 So such a woman has to be self-satisfied,

707
00:50:42,302 --> 00:50:44,812
satisfied in her self because she has to give.

708
00:50:44,911 --> 00:50:47,792
The person who has to give, how can she demand?

709
00:50:47,994 --> 00:50:50,699
She has to give love because she is love.

710
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,719
She has to give all the services.

711
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,761
She has to give all the possessions,

712
00:50:55,904 --> 00:50:59,216
she has to sooth down. What a responsibility, I tell you,

713
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:01,291
what a responsibility!

714
00:51:02,172 --> 00:51:05,389
More than a Prime Minister, more than any king or anyone,

715
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:07,289
is the responsibility of a woman,

716
00:51:07,424 --> 00:51:10,617
and she should feel proud of it,
 that such a responsibility has come to me.

717
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:12,720
A housewife

718
00:51:12,872 --> 00:51:16,387
 has much more responsibility than a leader of Sahaja Yoga.

719
00:51:17,384 --> 00:51:21,616
But the wives of leaders can be horrid

720
00:51:23,303 --> 00:51:25,342
because they think they have become leaders.

721
00:51:25,493 --> 00:51:27,059
I mean, this is the minimal of minimum.

722
00:51:27,178 --> 00:51:30,768
I mean it's like, I said, the ocean coming into a little cup.

723
00:51:32,899 --> 00:51:36,791
And their behaviour becomes so funny and absurd, I am surprised.

724
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:41,351
 I was married in a family where we had 100 people living together

725
00:51:45,285 --> 00:51:48,756
and each one of them adores Me.

726
00:51:49,288 --> 00:51:51,704
If I go somewhere in Lucknow,

727
00:51:51,855 --> 00:51:54,135
all of them will come from all over to see  me

728
00:51:54,215 --> 00:51:57,336
but my husband goes, nobody comes to see him.
He always complains.

729
00:51:58,238 --> 00:52:02,431
He's the relation, I am not the relation,
 and they come and see me, not him!

730
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,152
If I had not given them love,

731
00:52:07,287 --> 00:52:09,703
if I had not given them whatever they wanted

732
00:52:10,136 --> 00:52:12,017
they would have not come to Me.

733
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:17,594
So they are the preservers, preservers of others.

734
00:52:17,892 --> 00:52:20,796
 They don't have to preserve things for themselves.

735
00:52:22,784 --> 00:52:26,230
And we have many stupid women with us, I tell you,

736
00:52:26,365 --> 00:52:27,995
many stupid women.

737
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:31,846
We call them buddhu (idiot) in Hindi language, the buddhus.

738
00:52:34,011 --> 00:52:36,979
Because they don't know what power they have got.

739
00:52:40,463 --> 00:52:43,669
They don't know what responsibility they have.

740
00:52:45,403 --> 00:52:47,673
 I'm an example before them.

741
00:52:51,954 --> 00:52:55,572
 And this is the very big problem with me that practically

742
00:52:55,866 --> 00:52:59,058
I think 60% leaders have horrible wives.

743
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,681
I must say, horrible.

744
00:53:04,195 --> 00:53:06,750
And Sahaja Yoga goes 'dhup' like that with them.

745
00:53:07,778 --> 00:53:09,698
They can't live in an ashram,

746
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:12,956
they will have their food,
 the husband must see that they have their food.

747
00:53:13,075 --> 00:53:15,903
But it is they who have to feed everyone,

748
00:53:16,086 --> 00:53:19,675
everybody has to be looked after and at the end they should eat.

749
00:53:23,279 --> 00:53:26,739
Everybody must get a bed, they must see everybody is sleeping now,

750
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:29,812
they must cover all the children, everything, then they must sleep.

751
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:33,987
But No, they sit down,

752
00:53:34,123 --> 00:53:36,924
they become mini-matajis or greater-than-matajis.

753
00:53:37,607 --> 00:53:40,308
"Get me this thing! Get me that!

754
00:53:40,443 --> 00:53:42,303
Just do that! Do this!"

755
00:53:46,731 --> 00:53:49,079
They don't know how to cook, most of them.

756
00:53:50,108 --> 00:53:53,861
Every wife of a leader

757
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:59,006
has to cook and learn cooking. It's compulsory now.

758
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,568
They have to cook. And with heart.

759
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,134
They should be able to cook and give with love to others.

760
00:54:11,764 --> 00:54:14,164
That's the minimum of Annapurna.

761
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:19,594
And the husband shouldn't find faults with them.

762
00:54:19,869 --> 00:54:22,887
In the beginning they might make mistakes then encourage.

763
00:54:23,197 --> 00:54:26,271
Encourage their qualities, encourage their goodness,

764
00:54:26,401 --> 00:54:28,599
encourage their niceness.

765
00:54:28,901 --> 00:54:31,357
 Also I have seen, some very good ladies

766
00:54:31,429 --> 00:54:34,311
who were taking very active life in Sahaja Yoga.

767
00:54:34,415 --> 00:54:35,672
After marriage they are lost.

768
00:54:35,736 --> 00:54:38,941
Husbands are also supposed to be Sahaja Yogis - lost.

769
00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:44,964
Sometimes they appear, sometimes if I am there they come,
 otherwise they are not there.

770
00:54:45,943 --> 00:54:49,787
Today I was asking Arnaud,
 he told me so many of them are like that here.

771
00:54:50,695 --> 00:54:53,515
That means there's something wrong with the husbands

772
00:54:54,923 --> 00:54:57,240
because before marriage they were better off.

773
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:03,397
 So how much it is important, a Gruhakshmi Principle with in us,

774
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,696
for us to be together,

775
00:55:05,959 --> 00:55:09,149
to us to grow together. To feel the togetherness,

776
00:55:09,398 --> 00:55:11,897
all the time, the oneness that is within us.

777
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:16,038
 So yesterday, as I told you, that I'll tell you about

778
00:55:16,197 --> 00:55:17,855
the Ragas we have.

779
00:55:18,086 --> 00:55:19,900
Ra is energy.

780
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:24,540
Ga is in Sanskrit language 'Ga, Gayathi'  means 'which penetrates',

781
00:55:24,699 --> 00:55:26,040
'which moves into everything',

782
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:30,265
it's the ethereal, etheric qualities.

783
00:55:31,152 --> 00:55:33,096
etheric...... into which you see

784
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:36,136
You put anything in the ether and  you can receive it anywhere.

785
00:55:36,946 --> 00:55:41,393
 So the Raga, is the energy which goes into ether

786
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,358
and touches your spirit.

787
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,694
That is the Raga.

788
00:55:49,324 --> 00:55:54,796
And these Ragas, I would say are something like a housewife.

789
00:55:59,845 --> 00:56:03,900
Supposing if you stand with a military band

790
00:56:04,367 --> 00:56:07,580
you will be fed up, "left right, left right, left right".

791
00:56:09,418 --> 00:56:13,515
But a beautiful melody that's a melodious thing, melody.

792
00:56:13,725 --> 00:56:18,575
And this melody itself is suggestive of a beauty.

793
00:56:20,247 --> 00:56:23,429
 The way the housewife decorates the house.

794
00:56:23,885 --> 00:56:28,021
She smoothes down everyone, makes them feel happy.

795
00:56:28,232 --> 00:56:30,177
Then she's looking after everyone.

796
00:56:30,257 --> 00:56:32,376
 Everybody knows she is standing there.

797
00:56:32,544 --> 00:56:36,658
Imagine, like a modern style would be, you call

798
00:56:36,921 --> 00:56:40,479
some people for birthday cake of your child

799
00:56:40,733 --> 00:56:42,808
and you cut the cake first

800
00:56:43,753 --> 00:56:45,700
because you are the housewife.

801
00:56:46,566 --> 00:56:50,164
How will it look? It is that ridiculous, I tell you.

802
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,376
The way the housewife always puts forward before everybody else.

803
00:56:54,646 --> 00:56:57,919
They have to be on the back because you have to look after.

804
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,935
Look after all of them,

805
00:57:03,364 --> 00:57:07,814
and this is what is a Raga is.

806
00:57:07,876 --> 00:57:12,485
It caters to all your angularities.

807
00:57:12,589 --> 00:57:15,710
Supposing a person is very upset and worried,

808
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:18,467
comes from office, sits down, puts on a Raga.

809
00:57:19,257 --> 00:57:20,883
It soothes you down.

810
00:57:22,642 --> 00:57:24,856
It makes you settle down.

811
00:57:25,602 --> 00:57:30,798
Like people come home for five days, live like

812
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,721
 I don't know, what to call, not even hotels,

813
00:57:33,986 --> 00:57:36,932
and live in a tent-like thing

814
00:57:37,083 --> 00:57:40,181
and the sixth day they are out at the sea

815
00:57:40,946 --> 00:57:42,819
or they go and stay in a hotel.

816
00:57:43,224 --> 00:57:45,465
Nobody wants to stay in the house

817
00:57:46,037 --> 00:57:49,262
because there is no Gruhalakshmi principle between the two.

818
00:57:52,027 --> 00:57:55,619
But Raga needs better this  sitting down, settling down.

819
00:57:55,814 --> 00:57:58,931
Unless and until you settle down, you cannot enjoy Raga.

820
00:57:59,046 --> 00:58:02,720
Imagine somebody listening to a raga when he's a jumpy.

821
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,734
So, one has to settle down

822
00:58:07,139 --> 00:58:12,557
and that settling down is what is the work of a woman

823
00:58:12,836 --> 00:58:14,457
who is a housewife,

824
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,325
and the man has to act, is to settle down.

825
00:58:18,923 --> 00:58:22,702
 As I have told you many a times how your left Nabhi goes out

826
00:58:22,824 --> 00:58:24,784
in the modern times, much more,

827
00:58:25,227 --> 00:58:29,772
and many children are also born of the women who are hectic.

828
00:58:30,165 --> 00:58:32,156
Is that the wife...

829
00:58:32,906 --> 00:58:35,995
normally in India before, you see,

830
00:58:36,075 --> 00:58:38,363
the husband used to get up, have his bath,

831
00:58:38,593 --> 00:58:40,715
all the time his wife is not with him.

832
00:58:40,977 --> 00:58:43,852
She is cooking for him. She is looking after the children.

833
00:58:44,152 --> 00:58:48,130
All the time sticking on to husband also is a sign of boredom.

834
00:58:48,845 --> 00:58:51,379
Husband gets bored, the wife gets bored,

835
00:58:51,707 --> 00:58:53,389
then they have a divorce.

836
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:57,007
So must have other interests like looking after the children,

837
00:58:57,165 --> 00:58:59,467
household, Sahaja Yoga, things like that.

838
00:58:59,962 --> 00:59:03,535
Then he comes from the bath, he sits,

839
00:59:04,204 --> 00:59:06,524
sits on the ground, in India.

840
00:59:06,715 --> 00:59:09,257
Now we are sitting on the tables, all right,

841
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,282
at least sit on the tables, not on the table, but on the chair.

842
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:16,747
Then she doesn't tell him at this time "Why did you do like this?"

843
00:59:18,165 --> 00:59:20,117
Or  "This lady was quarrelling

844
00:59:20,237 --> 00:59:22,905
or I met another lady she was telling me you were this

845
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:26,209
and you were that." No! She says "Let him eat his food".

846
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:28,515
That's why in India

847
00:59:28,635 --> 00:59:30,722
 if husband has to show his temper he doesn't eat

848
00:59:30,825 --> 00:59:33,876
 his food in the house or he will wash his underclothes himself.

849
00:59:38,085 --> 00:59:39,913
That is how, they show their temper.

850
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:43,119
 So then she fans the husband slowly

851
00:59:43,321 --> 00:59:46,973
and tells him good things, you see, today you know why?

852
00:59:47,222 --> 00:59:51,263
My son got up and he said "I love my father very much".

853
00:59:51,965 --> 00:59:54,823
He said  "Really?" "Yes, yes. He said, he said so".

854
00:59:55,088 --> 00:59:58,366
And husband knows she is telling lies also,

855
01:00:02,158 --> 01:00:04,279
but you see all nice things, you see,

856
01:00:04,448 --> 01:00:07,544
and "I think better your mother is much better now.

857
01:00:07,706 --> 01:00:09,775
I think I'll go and look after your mother.

858
01:00:09,904 --> 01:00:11,507
And your sister is coming.

859
01:00:11,635 --> 01:00:13,611
So I think you are buying a Sari for her."

860
01:00:13,771 --> 01:00:15,787
All such nice - nice thing she will talk to him.

861
01:00:16,033 --> 01:00:20,255
So he eats his food nicely then he goes washes his hands

862
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:23,280
and goes in a bullock cart, not in a car

863
01:00:23,465 --> 01:00:25,601
where there is a jam, always.

864
01:00:26,287 --> 01:00:31,400
Alright, now the bullock cart is over, the fan is over.

865
01:00:31,841 --> 01:00:35,088
You have to be very fast. Life is fast now.

866
01:00:35,319 --> 01:00:37,591
In this fast thing, as I have told you,

867
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:40,228
that on the periphery of the

868
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:43,630
wheel you have the speed

869
01:00:43,865 --> 01:00:48,548
but at the axis it is not.
So the Sahaja Yogis have to be at the axis,

870
01:00:49,296 --> 01:00:53,671
and so the husband and the wife,
 the left and the right side of a chariot

871
01:00:54,055 --> 01:00:56,175
have to be on the axis

872
01:00:56,398 --> 01:00:59,233
and the left is left and the right is right.

873
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:02,428
 Now the women always take more time to get ready.

874
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:04,914
Not me, I take less than My husband,

875
01:01:05,535 --> 01:01:09,846
much less than my husband, but normally. So, that is their habit.

876
01:01:10,389 --> 01:01:13,954
Forget it. Now women have their own habits.

877
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:17,402
They are women. Women will remain women, men will remain men.

878
01:01:17,609 --> 01:01:19,785
Men must see their watches ten times.

879
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:24,790
Women might see it once or may be
their watches are lost or out of order -

880
01:01:25,013 --> 01:01:26,612
if they are real women.

881
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:30,082
They are not jumpy like men, they are different type.

882
01:01:30,498 --> 01:01:33,746
But they are women and you are men,

883
01:01:33,937 --> 01:01:36,851
and God has made men and women.

884
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,998
If it was to make a unisex,

885
01:01:39,141 --> 01:01:41,641
He would have made unisex, He did not.

886
01:01:43,014 --> 01:01:46,326
 So one must accept the sex is which you are born,

887
01:01:46,549 --> 01:01:51,220
with grace and beauty and dignity - both.

888
01:01:51,651 --> 01:01:54,160
And you must know this is Woman's party!

889
01:01:54,508 --> 01:01:57,557
 In India we have this thing like, you know,

890
01:01:57,724 --> 01:02:00,816
I was married in a family,

891
01:02:00,903 --> 01:02:03,914
very orthodox where they used to even cover the face and all that.

892
01:02:04,113 --> 01:02:06,844
So, one day, the collector, is the friend of my husband,

893
01:02:07,012 --> 01:02:10,998
so, he told my elder brother-in law that, why not the wife of

894
01:02:11,422 --> 01:02:13,281
my friend come and see Me.

895
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:19,554
So he said, "Of course! of course!" So just to make it easy for him

896
01:02:19,756 --> 01:02:23,099
he took leave from his office and disappeared into another town

897
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:26,778
and told his wife that "See that she goes and sees the collector".

898
01:02:27,154 --> 01:02:29,075
See how beautiful it was,

899
01:02:32,986 --> 01:02:35,192
how beautiful it was,

900
01:02:37,514 --> 01:02:40,000
and I never felt that he was dominating Me

901
01:02:40,112 --> 01:02:43,764
because after all that was the system of that family,
alright, its alright.

902
01:02:46,363 --> 01:02:50,430
 But for this what you need is Pure Intelligence.

903
01:02:51,354 --> 01:02:54,552
If the husband is a dullard he'll bring down his wife.

904
01:02:54,849 --> 01:02:57,653
If the wife is a dullard she'll bring down her husband.

905
01:02:57,971 --> 01:03:02,282
If the woman is very smart, talks well and you know she knows how to

906
01:03:03,201 --> 01:03:06,914
talk and impress people doesn't mean that she is very intelligent.

907
01:03:07,195 --> 01:03:11,316
I call that person the most intelligent who sees the benevolence,

908
01:03:14,697 --> 01:03:18,651
the ascent and the ultimate goal.

909
01:03:18,834 --> 01:03:22,425
That person is the most sensitive,

910
01:03:22,918 --> 01:03:24,642
is the most intelligent.

911
01:03:25,025 --> 01:03:28,048
All other intelligence is avidya, is useless.

912
01:03:28,877 --> 01:03:31,434
Now, on this subject I think I can write a book,

913
01:03:31,593 --> 01:03:33,183
so, is better leave it to the book,

914
01:03:33,334 --> 01:03:35,455
and today let us have the puja

915
01:03:35,582 --> 01:03:37,153
May God Bless You.

916
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:38,965
 Any questions?

917
01:03:44,657 --> 01:03:47,316
This means, I'll be spending some money?

918
01:03:48,732 --> 01:03:51,774
I don't know, there's no chance. I don't know when will spend.

919
01:03:51,964 --> 01:03:54,583
I love to spend, I mean, everybody should love to spend.

920
01:03:54,703 --> 01:03:56,337
 That's why the money is for.

921
01:03:56,451 --> 01:03:58,189
Must give to others, you see.

922
01:03:58,252 --> 01:04:00,308
Why the matter is there? Matter is to give to others.

923
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,252
Just enjoy giving others.

924
01:04:03,351 --> 01:04:05,938
So enjoyable, to give something to others.
