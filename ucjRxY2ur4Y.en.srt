1
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:29,310
and that's why that's why this water

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,050
which is the Trina fire water is the

3
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:36,420
purified water purifies us physically

4
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:40,110
and also our poisons are driven out of

5
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,600
our never also my water water is on a

6
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,120
very great element in removing all

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,120
problems you use water for so many

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,780
things you know how he went up so this

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,410
Lakshmi which is purification was born

10
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,649
out of what that's why she was called as

11
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:02,989
many as I to me and I am also called as

12
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,989
Mila may be born out of what

13
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:13,310
so one has to understand that today's

14
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,310
message is that we inculcate

15
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:23,170
we should not cheat it really easy to

16
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:28,690
keep what mission in forget you will

17
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:34,270
take within ourselves as a matter of our

18
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:39,400
own action as our own declaration and

19
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:42,910
our own deity and not just because it's

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:47,710
a it's a lugubrious thing or it is a

21
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:50,890
very hard thing not like it should be

22
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:58,030
achieved with great pleasure and happen

23
00:01:50,890 --> 00:02:01,740
how do we like to have a bar in the same

24
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:04,479
way we should try to clean our thoughts

25
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:10,590
just by paying attention to them you can

26
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,590
clean so to keep it pure and simple is

27
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:18,630
take two water element as much as which

28
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,880
helps water it has zero etirsa

29
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:27,550
take to water element and that is what

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:32,380
Lakshmi is Lakshmi is the one that gives

31
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:35,440
you the Mahalakshmi not from the Lakshmi

32
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,780
only the Maharaj means this word Ronson

33
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,050
and we see after the purification

34
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:45,269
through the Lakshmi process see

35
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:48,940
Mahalakshmi is water so now you turn

36
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:52,110
depends that's a done now one rinsing it

37
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,110
down whatever whatever

38
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:04,760
satisfied now coming to the pot it

39
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:07,500
fetches the first the spiritual trust

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,080
you can trace the spiritual thirst of

41
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,530
people tremendous power because we

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,490
believe in the realization that the

43
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:22,670
seeking is over all right then another

44
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,670
one now communal what are the [ __ ]

45
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,530
dinkleberg water

46
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,190
nourishment

47
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,700
you know spiritual nourishment to people

48
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,590
through your power even if you are

49
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,590
standing there you're nourishing others

50
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:54,560
then it's a solvent you dissolve their

51
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,420
ego you dissolve their somebody all

52
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:05,210
these powers are your own route to

53
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:09,440
realization just think of it waters give

54
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:14,450
anything if anything divinity but that's

55
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:16,310
very way because divinity how to relate

56
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:51,430
it with water people won't understand so

57
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:57,580
let us carry others and carry others

58
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:57,580
very gently and also drown some of them

59
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:10,730
now into the lotion but you can also

60
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:17,150
push them with two running jumps all

61
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:20,420
right that also can be done it has a

62
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:23,240
very great quality that water permeates

63
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:27,190
and to the smallest parts when it goes

64
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:30,170
to the roots and it stuck to the rooms

65
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:32,000
so Mohammed will power you just see the

66
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:34,720
roots of the person we just know where

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,520
the problem comes from jump

68
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:44,720
actually it is it is the event tell me

69
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,850
the truth father whose get sunlight and

70
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,880
you understand that now where is the

71
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,930
problem and you just phony eternity and

72
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:56,450
you sucked

73
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:58,870
you can be easily sucked before need you

74
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,340
see when you are sitting near a person

75
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:04,670
and you tell me mother this is catching

76
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:07,160
at the back the person doesn't work not

77
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,690
permeated personality is permeated is

78
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,210
one person even though you have

79
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:15,020
permeated instantly and you are feeling

80
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:17,600
the roots when is the problem the water

81
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:21,620
is flowing into that mean the divine

82
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:26,420
water is flowing into that B and AB such

83
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:29,260
an expense so that divine water and you

84
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:32,480
can say that this is that exact strategy

85
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:36,920
so the Fermi is permeating and the

86
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,150
another one is the glistening what is so

87
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:47,210
you are still

88
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:50,570
still becomes very good and the last of

89
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:55,699
all is the reflection the person who

90
00:06:50,570 --> 00:07:01,940
sees you sees his own reflection that's

91
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:04,130
right and I don't mean anything back to

92
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,040
anyone but people are unnecessarily

93
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:10,130
frightened of me because they see their

94
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,750
reflection so when they meet you they

95
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,990
see the reflection they can be very

96
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:17,000
aggressive so they see their reflection

97
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,900
they can be very hard on because they

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,900
see their touch

99
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:30,000
i if it is clear-cut

100
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:33,780
water then you see the depth of the

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,050
person if you are are clear-cut some

102
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:44,000
Yogi's they feel the depth 3 and they

103
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,000
can see through the spirit shine

104
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:55,290
these are the quality of water within us

105
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:59,720
the more of that I would say especially

106
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:03,030
in my body the water acts as a buffer to

107
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,960
protect with chakra if I don't have

108
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:10,650
water in the body and I may have broken

109
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:14,940
so it acts as a buffer also it suits

110
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:18,510
your epithelial cells you can say it

111
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,310
suits your lining see there's no

112
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:29,070
moisture you feel all these dinosaurs

113
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:33,060
you know it's so separate and there are

114
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:37,910
other types of powers of water which we

115
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:42,800
know that when it comes out of your eyes

116
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:42,800
it expresses your compassion

117
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:56,819
that's the only thing out of all the

118
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:59,149
elements which expresses emotions water

119
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:59,149
power

120
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:07,080
what are the other qualities also which

121
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:11,110
makes people know how to static

122
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:14,380
pressure because of pressure and a

123
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:17,410
person would exist like a sahaja yogi

124
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:20,410
will definitely put a pressure on others

125
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,180
you will not you will not address but

126
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,310
there will be a pressure and pressure

127
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:29,020
and another core CitiField

128
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:31,540
the cement and he gets the advantage of

129
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:34,630
it but if he does not receive me then he

130
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:38,350
feels pressurized and it is a little bit

131
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:40,839
dominating your neighbors your family

132
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,450
beacon and the beginning with geodesic

133
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:48,700
pressure because the body achieves a

134
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:53,529
kind of a weight and that's how the guru

135
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:58,120
tattwa is formed out of them I eat there

136
00:09:53,529 --> 00:10:04,290
is salt that's a new principle then the

137
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:10,060
weight is even more so today for water

138
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:14,740
should really know that water is a very

139
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:18,690
holy thing and in our use especially

140
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:24,160
this thing signifies the Kundalini that

141
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:28,240
means the Kundalini is the water jar or

142
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:31,779
the Terrier Aquarius and this is the age

143
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:36,720
of the experience so how important is

144
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:41,839
water and the water is the carrier of

145
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,629
divine love is the best barrier

146
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,829
and this is the time of the acquiesce

147
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:54,050
mr. Kundalini

148
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:58,699
it's made of divine water so the whole

149
00:10:54,050 --> 00:11:04,279
idea of celebrating today then that

150
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:07,939
means they is to understand that in us

151
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:10,670
she has become a Mahalakshmi and by that

152
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:12,589
we have so many powers of which we are

153
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,089
not aware I mean we do not know so that

154
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:16,129
we are realized Souls some of us do not

155
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:18,259
know and that we have those powers

156
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:21,019
within us that we can permeate Internet

157
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:24,279
you can project ever personality on us

158
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:26,899
you can find out what's wrong with that

159
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:28,660
we can find out about ourselves we can

160
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:31,759
go into our selves you can go to our

161
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:37,069
permeation is like water is very flowing

162
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:40,040
order and this it's a very important

163
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:42,319
that we should be aware of our powers

164
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,509
that knowledge then we start respecting

165
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:46,959
ourselves there is Raja Lakshmi come see

166
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:49,550
and then that Mahalakshmi comes in and

167
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:54,050
everything comes with it when we become

168
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:56,589
aware of what we have a challenge of our

169
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,589
self-esteem

170
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:05,860
of our technique so this gives us

171
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:08,110
dignity Maya gives us dignity and that's

172
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:11,980
how we start understanding the value of

173
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:14,500
human beings sense of dignity and we

174
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:21,390
live it our own dignity and that's how

175
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:23,680
it should be pure transparent on it

176
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,870
within ourselves we should be honest

177
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,660
absolutely honest water we sew on a

178
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:33,910
spirit self we put anything into the

179
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:36,280
water feature put any color equation put

180
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:40,570
an American show you have to be so

181
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:43,210
honest honest now the whole thing should

182
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:47,380
work out to be a personality very

183
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:51,310
congenial beautiful permeating no doubt

184
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:54,010
but rain unlikely because mihashi that

185
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:58,480
by itself is enlightenment in every way

186
00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:02,080
