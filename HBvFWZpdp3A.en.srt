1
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:05,159
Today, we have gathered here to worship Shri
Lakshmi.

2
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:25,710
In Diwali, in India, they worship Lakshmi
because a great rakshasa called Narakasura

3
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:42,139
was killed. Also that Lakshmi came out of
the sea, at the same time, long time back.

4
00:06:42,139 --> 00:07:00,520
I mean, I should say, this is like Her different
appearances on the same XXX. Lakshmi is the

5
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:16,430
Goddess which gives us wealth, gives us prosperity.
She is very blissful, no doubt. She gives

6
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:30,930
you protection and also She is very humble
because She stands on the lotus. She is very

7
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:43,789
light, means doesn’t put Her pressure on
anyone. These are symbols of Shri Lakshmi,

8
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:52,750
but also She is a part of Mahamaya in the
modern times. When people get Lakshmi, the

9
00:07:52,750 --> 00:08:09,969
money, they don’t understand that She is
their Mother and She is to be respected. When

10
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:21,719
this kind of perverse idea of Shri Lakshmi
comes in such countries, such people meet

11
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:38,880
their last end and destruction of the worst
type. So this Lakshmi has to be used with

12
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:49,870
a big balance, like standing on a lotus and
not get into the pond, where there are all

13
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:59,840
kinds of creatures to eat you all. You have
to stand on the lotus, that means that you

14
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:17,510
are above all the lures of this Maya. Also
in Sanskrit languages, we call Lakshmi as

15
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:24,600
the Maya. If somebody gets lot of money, they
will say: "You got lot of Maya."

16
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:39,100
Now, this Maya plays the tricks. If money,
prosperity was the salvation, then, there

17
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:50,190
would have been no problem in this world because
those people who have money always get ruined.

18
00:09:50,190 --> 00:10:00,320
If they are not ruined, their children, their
grandchildren get ruined. This principle of

19
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:14,029
Lakshmi within us is very dubious and the
allurement is so much that people see somebody

20
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:21,680
having a good car these days, they say: "Oh,
what a man he is..." In any case, he’s not

21
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:32,970
going to give you the car. If somebody is
having lots of, what you can call, palaces

22
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:46,630
or buildings, people start admiring! This
is Kali Yuga. They start admiring: "See this

23
00:10:46,630 --> 00:11:00,339
man, he is so rich!" Even clothes: people
see you wearing clothes which are very good

24
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:16,170
tailored, might be from some designers, say.
They think knowing of that man. For example

25
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,910
in England, there is another befouling place
called "Saville Row." So if you want to buy

26
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:32,639
one suit, you have to pay sometimes 3000 pounds.
Now, people are so stupid that now if they

27
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:39,050
wear a suit from "Saville Row", they put the
brand outside, "Saville Row." All such thorough

28
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:50,430
foolery is going on all over the world. The
clothes have no meaning, their life style

29
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:58,440
has no meaning. Ultimately they end up in
Swiss bank.

30
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:08,769
The Lakshmi Tattwa of Swiss bank is also now
showing its teeth, and if you read what’s

31
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:18,360
happening to them, I mean, they are shaking,
they don’t know. They went to this limit

32
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:32,009
that they took the teeth, golden teeth of
the Jews! I mean, it’s going to far! All

33
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:39,110
this thorough foolery has been going on. They
have military services. Why? Who’s going

34
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:48,259
to conquer that country? Even Napoleon didn’t
do that. And they have made big caves to keep

35
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:55,529
their weapons there. Who’s going to attack
them? Stupid people... Suffering from ego.

36
00:12:55,529 --> 00:13:12,070
But the attack has come and this attack is
so serious that they might be completely shattered

37
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:21,829
and destroyed. Now, who falls for this kind
of thing, you should see, are the people who

38
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:38,829
are crooks, who are dishonest, who are absolutely
adharmic. They can be Mafia, XXX or they can

39
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:49,589
be some thugs, some black marketers, some
smugglers. So, going against the Lakshmi principle,

40
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:58,500
are so many done these days. One fellow who
was thrown out of Sahaja Yoga, because he

41
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,519
was trying to be very dominating and all that,
he said: "That’s better." I said: "Why?"

42
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:11,449
He’s doing now smuggling, making money out
of smuggling and he has become very rich,

43
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:23,670
according to him; but it comes to an end and
a very tragic, bad end. Money is such a lure

44
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:41,389
for human beings that it kills all sense of
decency of higher values, everything. A brother,

45
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:49,620
say, who is very nice and good fellow, if
he gets money out of proportion by doing hanky-panky,

46
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:57,089
he neglects his mother, father, brothers,
sisters, everything. So I would say, then

47
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:09,769
it comes to that point that Lakshmiji becomes
a bhoot then and all Her blessings becomes

48
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:23,940
a sort of a challenge to your dignity.
Now, certain countries, like America which

49
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:34,940
is the area for Shri Krishna, because He is
Kubera, they have no money as such. I’ve

50
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:44,509
seen they are all poor, they are all indebted.
So many Indians went to America and they can’t

51
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:51,209
come to India now. "Why?" "We are indebted."
"Why are you indebted?" "Oh, we get everything

52
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:59,540
free, now, you see, the bank gives us loan,
we can have the best life style." So they

53
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:06,569
will have three Mercedes. Is nothing! "Three
Mercedes is nothing. You should have Rolls

54
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:23,500
Royce’s, we should have this." "For what?
What do you get out of it?" Now of course,

55
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:30,519
little bit they are shaken out with the stock
exchange and all that nonsense they have started,

56
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:48,759
all these jokes and all these very big kind
of loggerheads. All now are coming out. So,

57
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:58,120
this is no Lakshmi, because Lakshmi must give
you dignity, prosperity and respect. I think

58
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,860
Americans understood about it, so they become
philanthropist, means they are giving money

59
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:12,440
to people. To whom did they give money? All
the names these people took from South Africa

60
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:24,490
were all the money given by the philanthropist
of America. What has happened to their wisdom?

61
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:36,270
That 16-year old boy, he went there and then
all ages went there and made a very big money.

62
00:17:36,270 --> 00:18:51,179
All this money making proposition...

63
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:58,590
So what is the matter if there is a blessing
of Lakshmi? Why a man who gets the blessing

64
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:10,020
of Lakshmi becomes so funny, so stupid and
ultimately ends up his life that people are

65
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:33,530
not there even to pick up his dead body?
What is the difference between money and Lakshmi?

66
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:39,870
She gives you money, alright, agreed, but
when She is giving the money, what happens

67
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:49,309
to that money which comes to you? It’s a
very subtle thing one should understand. In

68
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:57,809
India if you give 100 rupees to a servant,
immediately he’ll go to drink somewhere.

69
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:07,179
First, idea will come, what he should do,
he’ll go for a drink. Of the hard one, I

70
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:14,740
mean; your moorka is nowhere near that, such
hard one they make in India, you know. It

71
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:25,830
is called as Hatbhatti, made with hands. So
in 100 rupees, they are willing to go. I mean,

72
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:38,529
that means any money you give to them, it
spoils their life completely. Lakshmi has

73
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:48,870
been given, alright, so what happen to this
Lakshmi? She changes Her form and Her form

74
00:20:48,870 --> 00:21:00,230
is so bad that you are completely ruined with
that.

75
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:17,770
So, now we have to understand what is the
way we can use the Lakshmi. Supposing I get

76
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:32,400
money, supposing. Then I will go to the market,
say, and I’ll see something nice: "Ahh!

77
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:44,210
This is very good for this Sahaja Yogi." Or
I will say: "This will be very handy for our

78
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:57,929
ashram." Immediately the mind starts working
in a very socialistic way, I should say. Not

79
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:08,400
individualistic. For example, I went to Rajasthan
and I saw such a lot of sand, just like a

80
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:19,510
big desert, big dunes, everything. And people
starving. So I said: "How to get money to

81
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:32,179
these people?" So, I said: "Let Me start a
factory, factory with the unbreakable glass,

82
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:42,700
which they make only in France." They make
it very cheap and regarded as a very cheap

83
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:51,850
thing, not in India. In India, if you go to
some elite’s house, they’ll offer you

84
00:22:51,850 --> 00:23:00,740
tea in these unbreakable things, they think
it’s very elite, you know, it depends on

85
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:12,320
what you think about. And very proud of it.
So, I said, if you make these things in India,

86
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,230
these poor people, you know, because there
is so much sand and sand is needed by trucks,

87
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:31,840
so I will utilise this to make this beautiful
factory here and then give them some support

88
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:43,190
to live well.
Now, when I went to one place called Warana.

89
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:50,400
You all had come also once. There’s a gentleman
who was a disciple of Gandhiji and he has

90
00:23:50,400 --> 00:24:01,260
organised this Warana company for distributing
milk. It became so very rich, so very rich,

91
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:07,059
it’s a co-operative, so he started giving
money to all the co-operative people, those

92
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:12,779
who were labour there. Now, this labour had
never seen that money, so he came to Me, touched

93
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:19,720
My feet and said: "Mother, You tell me now,
what should I do: I’m so unhappy with the

94
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:28,529
development of this Warana, because there
are prostitutes who arrived from Bombay, there

95
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:37,570
are all kinds of hard deals which have come
from Bombay and these people are smoking like

96
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:50,770
hell, they are taking drugs..." "Hey?" "Yes!
Wherever there is money, the drug goes there

97
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:57,350
and the children are becoming absolutely useless,
they don’t want to study, they even slap

98
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:08,480
their parents." So he said: "This was not
Gandhiji’s ideal, now what has happened?"

99
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,950
He says: "This is a curse of money." And he
was crying.

100
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:32,080
Now, how can Lakshmi become a curse? It does!
It is in the Nabhi. What a central position

101
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:54,929
it has and when this Nabhi starts working,
it is a very remarkable thing that you feel

102
00:25:54,929 --> 00:26:10,320
gobbling the food all the time with this Nabhi.
You go on eating, go on eating like mad and

103
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:19,230
then some bhoot comes in to eat also with
you inside the Nabhi. Then you can eat so

104
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:32,990
much that no human beings can eat like that,
except for the people who are rich. Then you

105
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:45,850
start a big science or what you can call etiquette.
I don’t want to hurt anybody, I mean, if

106
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:56,390
you are eating well I don’t mind, eat well.
But the fuss part is, because today is Diwali,

107
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:04,210
I’m trying to tell you all these interesting
stories.

108
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:17,370
I went many times for dinner with French diplomats.
My goodness!! Now, Me and My husband don’t

109
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:23,600
drink, so forty five minutes they were only
discussing what they will have today. Then

110
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,409
they remember, yesterday they had that, the
day before, they had that, so there should

111
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:36,830
be variety. So, then they came down to something,
not all of them drinking the same, different,

112
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:44,690
different. So, they came to some point: "Alright,
we’ll have this." But some people asked

113
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:53,320
for something which was not available. So
they said: "You have to have it!" And they

114
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:01,409
shouted at them. My goodness! They took forty
five minutes to decide what they are going

115
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:10,019
to eat. It’s regarded as French etiquette,
I think, and we took chief guest Myself and

116
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:17,679
My husband. Looking at this man and looking
at that woman, did not know what to do with

117
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,640
those etiquette. We were thinking, now better
go.

118
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:31,789
Then came to food. They are so particular:
"I like this and I like that." They are worst

119
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:45,659
than Indians, I think, and they took at least,
at least eighty minutes to decide what they

120
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:57,630
will eat. Ultimately, they found something
nice, each different and the restaurant people

121
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:03,070
were trying to pamper their ego: "Oh, what
a thing you have chosen, this is the....Wah,

122
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:17,929
wah, wah..." So they started serving. The
cheese was smelling so awful, I tell you.

123
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:28,010
We couldn’t bare it, you know, both of us,
so My husband told them: "Today is our fasting

124
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:35,549
day for both of us." He said: "Why is it a
fasting day?" He says: "In India, we have,

125
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:40,760
you know, fasting like this, sometimes we
have to fast; today is our..." But I told

126
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,019
him: "Here, one day you are saying today is
our fasting, but we have to go to so many

127
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:52,519
dinners, what will you do?" He says: "Everywhere,
better to say that we are fasting." Such a

128
00:29:52,519 --> 00:30:02,750
horrible cheese they brought and they started
boasting that they have 200 types of cheese,

129
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:17,610
200 types of the smelly ones. "From where
did you get?" They said: "This is French perfection!"

130
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:28,510
I said: "What is this French perfection?"
But then, you know, tears came into My eyes.

131
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:34,649
C.P. said: "Why are you crying?" "Not crying,
but I think what will happen to these people

132
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:46,730
with their cheese, where will they go? Even
if they go to hell, people will throw them

133
00:30:46,730 --> 00:31:00,320
away with the smell of the cheese."
Then I read how this cheese came in. So they

134
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:09,529
said that there was a big snow fall and they
had put some big, big containers in a cave

135
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:16,110
of milk and people forgot about it. Snow fall
was there for 20 days, whatever it was, and

136
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:21,820
they just forgot about it. So, after one year,
they got the smell, you see, coming out of

137
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:30,570
it; so they went and saw the cheese being
formed, can you imagine? This is the beginning

138
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:38,200
of the hell. Actually, one should never eat
anything that is kept overnight, normally.

139
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:46,950
But now they have got fridge, so you can keep
it for 2 days, 3 days at the most. Like on

140
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:53,909
the ship they keep it. But this I couldn’t
understand that this cheese which they told

141
00:31:53,909 --> 00:32:02,360
Me is very old. I said: "Really?" And they
sell it by that, what old it is. And their

142
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:10,990
wines, if they are, say, 200 years old it
is 200 times more expensive. So, it’s such

143
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:20,519
a bhootish thing to eat all that. So, when
the Lakshmi goes into the hands of bhoots

144
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:30,360
on a very less level, I should say, these
days, then it goes into the heads of people

145
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:42,980
who want to exploit money, exploit poor people,
exploit countries which are downtrodden, go

146
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:48,590
on like this, collecting money, you know,
looting, looting, looting.

147
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:56,659
When English came to India, we did know, they
used to take brides. On Diwali day if you

148
00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:02,289
went there without any present they say: "Oh,
baksheesh, you must give some presents." And

149
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:07,960
what they liked was our country liqueur, I
never knew this, but later on I came to know

150
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:14,500
because My husband became a collector of XXX
and there where bottles of country liqueurs

151
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:20,769
kept in that house, with that house was itself
more than hundred year old. Long time back

152
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:27,200
it was kept but still, some of them, you see
and we could have sent them to England to

153
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:35,799
sell, I mean, it would have been a good idea.
So, the older it is, it’s better. This Lakshmi

154
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:44,210
I think becomes old and dies and there is
alakshmi. Alakshmi means when you have money

155
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:51,360
and you don’t have the qualities of a person
who should have money. In that quality of

156
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:59,019
Alakshmi, you become very miserly, you don’t
want even to help your brothers and sisters,

157
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:05,080
you don’t want to give any money to anyone
and even if you give it, you give it to false

158
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:13,510
gurus and wrong things. This is up to, we
can say, is Alakshmi.

159
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:22,840
The behaviour becomes very arrogant, so arrogant
that you behave like horses you know, people

160
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:31,560
look like horses: they walk like horses, but
I don’t know if horses have ego. If you

161
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:39,960
see these people, you just don’t understand
what has gone wrong with them. There is one

162
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:46,200
gentleman who started an aeroplane business,
aeroplane business in India. I won’t take

163
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:56,250
his name but say some Majidya or something
like that and my granddaughter met him with

164
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:05,070
my grandson-in-law and they were walking like
this, talking like this, you see, they can’t

165
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:13,410
understand these two persons; so, they came
and talk to them who you are and all that

166
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:23,360
and then they said: "We are this Majidya."
So, my granddaughter said: "Who is Majidya?"

167
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:30,690
"My goodness!", they fell from heavens, "You
don’t know who are Majidyas, do you read

168
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:39,910
newspapers or not?" Then her husband came
in, he said: "I do." "Now what do you want

169
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:48,000
to say? We are Majidyas!" He said: "Who are
Majidyas?" "You don’t know? What sort of

170
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:56,570
business you do, what is this..." Such stupid
things they did that these children felt that

171
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:04,150
there is no use having any business; if business
means this kind of behaviour, very indecent,

172
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:14,640
very arrogant, they don’t know how to relate
to people, they don’t know! And after some

173
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:23,530
time, I heard that their business was completely
finished, was a flop, they call it a flop.

174
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:38,800
So now, we have to realise that this Lakshmi,
how it takes us to wrong things. Firstly,

175
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:54,010
She makes you very egoistical. Somehow, if
a man has money, he starts behaving like that.

176
00:36:54,010 --> 00:37:02,280
One cannot understand how a person who was
normal, suddenly becomes like this, starts

177
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:09,280
talking like this. He might earn money, even,
in the horse races.

178
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:26,590
Around the Lakshmi is the valence of Dharma.
There is around the Lakshmi, is the Dharma

179
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:34,860
and this Dharma if you cross, that’s the
best place where they can cross the Dharma.

180
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:50,560
Then, you can do whatever you like. This adharmi
which is irreligious, which is hideous, you

181
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:59,010
have to just cross that limit of that Dharma.
We have to just deviate from Dharma.

182
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:09,470
Now, as I said many a times that ten valences
human beings have got, but apart from that,

183
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:20,090
there are many Dharmas which are surrounding
everything, like angels. Like first Dharma

184
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:33,620
is your love for humanity, is the first Dharma
but if you say from that end when you start,

185
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:48,860
it starts with 3 Dharmas, is the Dharma of
the woman, how she should live, how she should

186
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:55,620
get married, how she should look after her
children, what should be her behaviour, all

187
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:04,700
is three Dharmas. And then is Patni Dharma,
is the wife, wife Dharma, what should be her

188
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:14,100
Dharma. In her Dharma she looks nice. If she
gives up her Dharma then she is a prostitute.

189
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:25,270
So, then is Pati Dharma: how should be a husband,
how he should behave towards his family, how

190
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:34,130
should he pay attention towards his wife,
about the whole entire family, the whole,

191
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:41,780
you can say parivar, as they call it, all
the relations. That is his Dharma but beyond

192
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:57,550
that is the Dharma of Satya Dharma: how much
he sticks to truth, then the Dharma for creativity.

193
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:03,840
In creativity as you know very well these
days, with money people are standing on their

194
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,460
heads or I don’t know what they are doing
because the amount of nonsense they are producing

195
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:18,300
all over the world in the name of modernism
is no way is Kala Dharma, no way.

196
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:30,320
Then we have also politics, Rajkaran Dharma.
This also Dharma is there, now taking bribes,

197
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:38,030
I mean the kind of things that are going on,
corruption, all kinds of things that are going

198
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:47,130
on, competition, fighting and all that. They
are falling from their Dharma of Rajkaran.

199
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:56,010
Education, same thing; we call it Shiksha
Dharma.

200
00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:07,730
All such things are Dharmas; there is a kind
of a principle which we have to keep, otherwise

201
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:20,010
you can topple down from the lotus and that’s
what happens. Now we have also Rashtra Dharma.

202
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:28,400
The Rashtra Dharma is that your country, there
is a Dharma of your Rashtra. When you have

203
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,290
to fight for your country, you should, but
you should not be aggressive on other countries,

204
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:41,410
it’s not right to dominate other countries
nor you should bring bad name to your country.

205
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:53,050
It’s very important! Sahaja Yogis have all
this intact, absolutely, because you are standing

206
00:41:53,050 --> 00:42:00,730
on the lotuses already. You don’t have this
problem, normally no. Once in a while there

207
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:09,240
are people who behave like that but mostly
Sahaja yogis don’t fall into these traps,

208
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:14,810
that’s why their Lakshmi Tattwa will definitely
improve. They’ll have little problems here

209
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:22,530
and there but without problems if you get
Lakshmi, you will not value for it. So, with

210
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:34,200
little problems, you get the Lakshmi. But
Lakshmi doesn’t give you all this imbalance.

211
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:45,590
Such a man has to be extremely balanced because
beyond that is the step of Mahalakshmi where

212
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:57,960
your seeking starts, where you become a seeker.
You go beyond Lakshmi principle and this Mahalakshmi

213
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:05,420
principle starts coming into it.
I would say the Western countries this consumerism

214
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:13,530
has started and it’s such a funny one. In
America, one lady was married to an Indian

215
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:21,530
and he used to tell Me how this consumerism
works. I said: "How?" He said: "I gave my

216
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:29,050
wife money to buy two shirts for me because
I had no shirts. So, she went and bought five

217
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:35,950
skirts. So, I said: "You have so many skirts,
why did you buy the skirts?" "Because in this

218
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:44,900
money I could buy five skirts instead of two
shirts, so I bought five skirts." So he said:

219
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:51,900
"I can’t wear skirts!" "So, how I should
correct her?" he said. I said: "You do one

220
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:58,940
thing, tell her you want to buy some skirts
for her and go and buy five shirts, then she

221
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:07,310
will realise that if the money was given to
her for one purpose should be used for that."

222
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:14,570
This is a very subtle principle which I follow
because I don’t understand money. So, what

223
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:20,510
I do, whatever money I get I put packets:
this is for this, this is for this, this is

224
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:26,150
for this, into packets. But I don’t understand,
you know and I don’t write accounts. I’m

225
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:32,220
very bad about all that. Somebody else does
that. Now, if I spend some money from one

226
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:38,170
pocket for some emergency, then I again fill
it back, it’s written there: so much is

227
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:43,240
there, so much is there. So, the money is
available at the right time for whatever I

228
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:55,050
want to do and the money is in the packet.
It is not in sort of an open thing that I

229
00:44:55,050 --> 00:45:00,610
can just want to buy a Mercedes, I want to
buy a Rolls Royce, no nothing doing, it is

230
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:11,200
for something, some purpose and there is no
need. So, when you go to the shop and you

231
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:17,630
see something, you won’t buy because that
money is not kept for that particular thing.

232
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:26,220
For Sahaja Yogis it is very easy to handle
their money with respect. So, you go to any

233
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:32,540
shop, you won’t buy anything.

234
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:39,170
But My nature also is spontaneous. So, I went
to Frankfurt, changing. They said: "Mother,

235
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:45,960
there is a very nice watch shop." I just thought
I’m going to get three son-in-laws and what

236
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:52,870
am I going to give them? So, I went to that
shop and I found such beautiful, beautiful

237
00:45:52,870 --> 00:46:02,080
things but I have not kept any money for the
watch, but I said I must buy. One of the watches

238
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:09,730
turned out to be a very unique one, I must
tell you, which is no more available. Because

239
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:18,370
of My eyes, I saw this something unique and
My son-in-law is so... I mean, over wealth,

240
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:26,540
so... quite rich, he has no problems, but
he said: "This watch you cannot get it." Then

241
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:36,050
an article came about that particular watch.
So he has kept it with him. You see, have

242
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:43,690
something that it should have a value behind
it. That is the Dharma part. Value behind

243
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:51,760
it; what is the value? When you want to buy
something just don’t buy because you are

244
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:59,790
mad, I mean instead of shirts you buy skirts,
not that way. But anything that has an artistic

245
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:07,190
value or some special value, then you should
buy that.

246
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:19,780
Now this sari I’m wearing, it has a special
value. Why? Not that it is made with hands

247
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:34,820
is a very beautiful design it has, no. This
was made in place called Paithan which was

248
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:52,260
the capital of a kingdom which belongs to
My forefathers: Shalivanas and these saris

249
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:59,010
were made there, Paithan and they used to
sell it to people. Now they have becoming

250
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:07,610
expensive, in those days they were cheaper.
Now, it has that value; they are very honest,

251
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:13,590
very religious, they are called Shalivanas
because they used to give shawls to the Goddess.

252
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:22,580
They spread their kingdom very much and also
there is a calendar in their name but the

253
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:30,460
kind of life they led: they were just very
generous people and they have made beautiful

254
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:41,010
temples, beautiful places for people to rest
near the river. I mean, so many beautiful

255
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:48,310
things they have done. Apart from that Rama
and Sita, when they went to Dandakaranya,

256
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:58,280
they went to this place and you have the place
where Sita took Her bath, Her bathing place.

257
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:07,780
There is a little river flowing there. How
it was covered from all the side and how the

258
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:15,120
light was coming, so beautiful. But whatever
Rama had done they redecorated it with the

259
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:26,730
Rajput style. Then also there was a very beautiful
temple, I saw that they have made. Also, I

260
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:40,020
don’t know how, there was some water flowing
and there was Shri Mahadeva, a big thing Pinda

261
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:53,320
and also there was a Parvati statue. So old
as that, I don’t know if it was put by Rama

262
00:49:53,320 --> 00:50:04,360
or by My own, you can call them great, great,
great grandfathers, but the beauty about that

263
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:15,800
place that it shows that Sita used to worship
Mahadeva. The water was flowing, somehow by

264
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:24,600
nature inside, up there in a stream and She
used to take the water and put it on that

265
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:35,500
pond. How deep these people were; those who
built that temple, such a beautiful temple

266
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:42,810
they have made. You see, so many temples are
built like this in India by people who had

267
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:56,160
money and they believed that if you spend
your money in this kind of work, you are blessed.

268
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:05,020
I bought a land, near the river Nira; that’s
My own name: Nira and this land I just bought

269
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:13,250
it just like that without thinking and what
they told that their guru, Shalivanas guru

270
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:23,950
was Shandilya and this place belonged to him
long time back which was an ashram of Shandilya,

271
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:34,740
exactly the same. And that land I bought,
very surprisingly. Then in the newspaper,

272
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:46,450
it came out everything about that land and
this land was the place where a great devotee

273
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:59,480
of Shri Vishnu: Pralada was playing. You must
have heard about Pralad. His mother had a

274
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:06,970
husband, long time, Hiranyakashapur was her
husband, horrible rakshasa, so she ran away

275
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:21,070
from there and who help her was Indra. He
brought this lady to the place of guru Shandilya

276
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:27,820
and Shandilya told him, Indra, that: "You
don’t put any effort for her, I’ll look

277
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:35,490
after her. And the child that is going to
be born to this lady is going to get the avatar

278
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:46,090
of Narasimha." You know Narasimha is the man
and the lion. He said: "How can that be?"

279
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:54,430
He said: "It is so." So Indra left her there.
The child was born. Till five years that child

280
00:52:54,430 --> 00:53:00,840
used to play in that land which I bought.
But I didn’t know about it. I just saw it;

281
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:08,000
I was surprised. But when the child grew up,
up to five years he had to go back to his

282
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:16,740
father. I don’t know how many of you read
about Pralada? Raise your hand, I would like

283
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:26,430
to know, let me see...who was killed and I
mean his father was trying to kill him and

284
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:42,070
torture him but he had certain boons. So Shri
Vishnu appeared as Narasimha, means the lion

285
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:49,510
and the human form. And then He killed this
Hiranyakashapur, the father.

286
00:53:49,510 --> 00:54:02,250
Now, imagine how much it was that thousands
years back, this must have happened and I

287
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:11,220
should purchase that land and there is a very
good temple built about 300 years back by

288
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:20,300
Maharashtrians. So, the story is that Pralada
came into the dream of the people who wanted

289
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:28,910
to built the temple and told them that: "I
already made a statue of Narasimha along the

290
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:38,220
river Nira." Imagine the name of the river
is also mine. "And if you can walk along the

291
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:46,720
banks of Nira river very close to the temple,
I’ve made the statue in sand." "It’s a

292
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:57,360
miracle!" So, they went there and they saw
that statue. They brought it back and installed

293
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:08,990
it in that temple. And it is still there,
made of sand. Also they say there’s a kind

294
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:19,460
of a river or a water flow, very small one,
just like the finger flows down from the top,

295
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:32,360
God knows how. So, now see the value, the
value of money which was collected to built

296
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:49,910
this temple had such an old value. So, the
value is not money. This, one should understand

297
00:55:49,910 --> 00:56:01,460
what is the value of the thing you want to
give something to others, then the feelings

298
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:14,220
you have in your heart is the value and that
value is the real Lakshmi. When you are, say,

299
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:28,150
building a house, the plans you make, the
things you do, what is the idea behind and

300
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:38,170
what you are trying to express through that
house is the value of that house.

301
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:49,710
Once you understand that, you have to buy
with this Lakshmi or you have to use this

302
00:56:49,710 --> 00:57:03,120
Lakshmi for certain value and not for showing
off or for money. This superficialness that

303
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:14,750
we have about money itself is like an ordinary
glass. But if you put behind the glass the

304
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:27,920
mercury you can see the value. So, when you
start buying something, what is the purpose?

305
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:36,760
Why are you buying? This will determine the
value. Like the last time I came to Portugal

306
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:48,110
and I said we’ll go and buy some terra-cotta.
But they are very expensive. I said this is

307
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:55,270
the price, but I wanted to buy terra-cotta
from Portugal because it’s very rigid. So,

308
00:57:55,270 --> 00:58:03,210
we went to one factory and the factory was
quite far away. None of them could find out,

309
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:11,250
but I told them: "It’s here only, just go
and see!" And then we bought the terra-cotta.

310
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:20,790
But on our way, I told: "Stop, stop here,
stop!" So, they stopped; there was a shop.

311
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:31,120
I had to buy some things for Sahaja Yogis
in India and also for some people in Cabella.

312
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:37,770
And that shop had such beautiful cottons.
There were some Sahaja Yogis from here who

313
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:46,280
saw that. Such beautiful clothes. I bought
a lot of it. I said: "Thank God, the problem

314
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:54,050
presents are finished now for India." So joy
giving it was. Everybody was surprised: "Why

315
00:58:54,050 --> 00:59:02,590
suddenly in a place where never have been
Mother there, suddenly She finds?" It has

316
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:11,480
a value because I wanted to buy some things
for Indians to be given as presents. So, if

317
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:23,470
a Lakshmi is say, this much, once you add
to it a value it becomes so.

318
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:32,940
The sign of a person who is Lakshmi Pati is
this: he should have a house like a lotus

319
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:44,150
in the hands of the Goddess, he should protect
people who are depending on him and from the

320
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:55,540
left hand, he should give. This is the image
of the Lakshmi. This is what the Lakshmi is

321
00:59:55,540 --> 01:00:05,140
within you. If you have this four things in
balance without conditioning, without ego,

322
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:15,520
then you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise, you
are not. On a Diwali day, you have to promise

323
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:25,590
ourselves that whatever we are going to get
now, as Lakshmi principle or as a Lakshmi’s

324
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:41,470
prasad, should be used in getting things which
has value and thus you will learn that you

325
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:49,280
have used your Lakshmi very well and with
that, your Mahalakshmi principle will become

326
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,790
very strong; you’ll become very strong by
which you will ascend very fast.

327
01:00:53,790 --> 01:01:07,010
Today is the day for us to celebrate the Lakshmi
Puja but Lakshmi Puja doesn’t mean that

328
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:18,940
you worship money. Money as it is, is the
most dangerous thing and I think it is the

329
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:29,890
hidden weapon of Lakshmi Devi. See, if you
try to misuse Her, She goes on punching you.

330
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:37,590
With one punch, if you don’t realise then
She gives you another punch. Like that, then

331
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:45,600
She might little bit twist you to suggest.
She’ll try everything to convince you that

332
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:54,800
what you are doing is nonsense. Ultimately,
She sees your destruction completely. So,

333
01:01:54,800 --> 01:02:03,930
Lakshmi, though She is the One who is the
giver of boons, giver of everything, you should

334
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:11,930
not be mislead by Her Mahamaya character.
I’m your Mother, so I better tell you to

335
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:18,100
be very careful! Thank you very much.
