1
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,769
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:37,780
At the very outset we have to know that the 
truth cannot be manipulated, cannot be created,

3
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:47,130
cannot be conceptualized by your mind or by 
your imagination.

4
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:56,270
It is what it is and has been and will be.

5
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:04,379
So the truth is very simple.

6
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,610
Very simple thing it is.

7
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:30,479
But you have to have very scientific outlook 
to keep your minds open because this the knowledge

8
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,909
of the roots.

9
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,860
What you see outside and what you know about 
it is the knowledge about the tree.

10
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:50,659
And should accept whatever I am saying as 
a hypothesis and if it is proved then as honest

11
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:54,840
people you have to accept it.

12
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:09,910
The truth is very simple that all this universe, 
this cosmos is looked after, is nourished,

13
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:23,660
is guided by all pervading divine power which 
is in Sanskrit language you can call it as

14
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:32,720
paramachaitanya and in quran its called as 
rooh.

15
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:45,510
In every great scriptures it is described 
as a formless energy that looks after guides

16
00:02:45,510 --> 00:03:04,110
everything that is living works out every 
balance of this universe , of this earth.

17
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:17,760
Only at the level of human awareness we have 
freedom to choose because we have to rise

18
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:26,510
to higher awareness of complete freedom.

19
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,420
That is why we commit mistakes.

20
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,150
Doesn’t matter.

21
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:37,940
After all we are human being we are not Gods.

22
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:45,790
So if we commit mistakes it makes it makes 
no difference whatsoever for your ascent to

23
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,020
that higher level.

24
00:03:48,020 --> 00:04:01,220
And the higher level is the second truth that 
you are not this body not this mind, not your

25
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:07,330
ego nor your conditionings but you are pure 
spirit.

26
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,900
That is what you have to be.

27
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:20,769
This can only work out through the living 
process of evolutionary ascent .

28
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:27,750
you have become a human being and now you 
have to become a higher human being.

29
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:36,250
As a human being you a develop a new kind 
of awareness.

30
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:43,699
On your central nervous system whatever we 
have achieved in our evolution we feel it

31
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:48,610
on our nervous system.

32
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:54,719
Like if you take dog or a horse through a 
place which is very filthy, dirty smelling

33
00:04:54,719 --> 00:05:00,050
it can pass through.

34
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,270
But human being cannot.

35
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,810
human beings have the sense of the colour 
of beauty of so many things they have achieved

36
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,100
through their evolutionary process.

37
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:17,300
But still the ascent is necessary because 
we do not know the absolute.

38
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:26,490
Whatever we know partially based on our experiences 
and our mistakes.

39
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:36,130
But sometimes we are so self opinionated that 
we don’t want to say that we have done mistakes

40
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,710
or not do we want to see that we want to seek 
higher.

41
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:46,090
But there are a category of people so many 
of them which William Blakes has beautifully

42
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,150
described as men seeking God.

43
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,970
Its very simple.

44
00:05:51,970 --> 00:06:04,380
The people who are seeking the truth and these 
are a special category who become sages.

45
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:10,729
And these sages he says will have power to 
make others the sages.

46
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:17,550
?? Louis has described, all over the world 
people have described about these great things

47
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,499
going t happen in this modern times.

48
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:28,600
Specially in India there was a pioneer or 
this is the one who originated of astrology

49
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,159
Bhrigumuni has written a book called nadi-granth.

50
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:36,669
In which he has described sahaja yoga, very 
clearly.

51
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:45,529
And he has said that such a time will come 
when people will get their realization sahaja.

52
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:56,710
Saha mean with , ja means born; born with 
you is the right united “yoga” with the

53
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,710
divine.

54
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,409
In modern yoga that we have got is a v bit 
of a v bit.

55
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:03,749
It has nothing to do with reality.

56
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:11,610
To know the reality, to feel the all pervading 
power is a right of every human being.

57
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,629
That’s all is called yoga.

58
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:19,490
And the another word another meaning of the 
yoga is yukti meaning the depthness.

59
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:39,590
The depthness to know to how to work out this 
power and also to know the principles of divine

60
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,500
powers.

61
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:51,169
But that is not mentally is no t mentally, 
it is on your nervous system.

62
00:07:51,169 --> 00:08:00,620
In the Buddhist philosophies is described 
as bodha.

63
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:08,559
Bodh doesn’t mean you feel it as a kind 
of a think??.

64
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:14,719
But, you feel it on your central nervous system.

65
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:21,449
Its not a some sort of a sensationalisaton 
but it is actulisation.

66
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,089
That is bodha.

67
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:25,539
Even the word vedas come from vida.

68
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:28,900
Vida also means on the central nervous system.

69
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,780
The reality is to be felt on our central nervous 
system.

70
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:45,230
Now we have here with us this mechanism built 
in.

71
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,480
in the bible its known as the tree of life.

72
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,110
Kirshna has also described it as a tree of 
life which is upside down.

73
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:57,840
The roots of which are in the head.

74
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:06,490
This is the tree of life described in most 
of the scriptures in different names.

75
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:12,470
Like in Tao, it refers to yangtze river as 
tao.

76
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:21,160
That tao is nothing but this kundalini which 
is the power which enlightens this tree of

77
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
life.

78
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:30,530
This kundalini is a power resides in the triangular 
bone known as sacrum.

79
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,920
Sacrum in latin language means sacred.

80
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,670
That means the Greeks knew in ancient times 
that this is a sacred bone which has something

81
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,490
sacred in it.

82
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,540
We all have this residual power within us 
known as kundalini.

83
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:54,150
Ofcourse in the modern times people have created 
all kinds of myths about the kundalini saying

84
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,150
it is very dangerous.

85
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,150
One should not do this and all.

86
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,150
Its all modern.

87
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:06,080
But in the ancient books even upto the time 
of Kabira they have all described it very

88
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,630
clearly, no body has said it is dangerous.

89
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:15,970
So may be some of the fake ones wanted to 
create a fear because they didn’t want people

90
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,970
to know the reality.

91
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:23,030
The must have created this kind of a myth 
saying that it is dangerous to awaken the

92
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,030
kundalini.

93
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:31,591
But this is the mother, your mother, your 
individual mother who is going to give you

94
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:33,500
your self-realization.

95
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:39,910
As your mother has taken all the troubles, 
labour problem upon herself; she takes all

96
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:45,610
the problems you have and you get a very smooth 
?? as self-realised souls.

97
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,270
This has to happen.

98
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:54,650
Because it is the vital, it is so vital that 
it has to be easy.

99
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,650
For eg.

100
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,220
Our breathing if you had to go to the library 
and read books and do all kinds of things,

101
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,020
we would not have existed.

102
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:07,610
In the same way it is such a vital thing that 
this kundalini has to rise.

103
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:15,220
Ofcourse, in the beginning of life this tree 
of life had very few flowers.

104
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,800
But gradually now I feel it’s a blossom 
time.

105
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,420
There are so many seekers who are seeking 
the truth and it is working wonders.

106
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:33,200
In a one day lecture, in a program like this 
its very hard to explain everything about

107
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
kundalini.

108
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:43,890
As it is I must have spoken thousands of times 
and then must be atleast 4000 tapes in English

109
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,890
language alone.

110
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,090
I have been working for 20 years to establish 
sahaja yoga all over the world.

111
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:54,370
And now there are 40 nations who have come 
to sahaja yoga.

112
00:11:54,370 --> 00:12:02,240
And I must pay full respect to Russians whom 
I found to be the best people for spirituality.

113
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,160
The best people for spirituality.

114
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:11,380
Whatever they might have been under, whatever 
might have happened to them, one thing they

115
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,510
didn’t waste the time much.

116
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:20,180
They were all very well educated, very solid 
sensible wise people.

117
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,980
And the way they took to sahaja yoga I was 
myself surprised.

118
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,530
We just arrived there and there were thousands.

119
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:34,860
And how did they managed to get their realization 
so fast and establish it is really, even the

120
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,180
Indians should feel ashamed of themselves.

121
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,820
Because this is the heritage of India.

122
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,460
This is the heritage of India.

123
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:49,040
But we had 300 years the Britishers ruling 
us perhaps so we have all become very westernized,

124
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,040
perhaps.

125
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:56,140
But I just don’t understand that how these 
people who have never talked of God, religion;

126
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,740
thank God for that also sometimes.

127
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,050
Because religion is also now a days man made; 
has conditioned people too much.

128
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,170
And they had no such fake gurus there roaming 
about.

129
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:13,150
And they just jumped into it.

130
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:19,320
Such a remarkable thing to see a country so 
far away, kept away from all the theologies

131
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,560
jumping into spirituality so fast.

132
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,160
Even ofcourse in India we have lots of people 
who are sahaja yogis all over I must admit

133
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,700
because after all this is their heritage.

134
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:38,422
And also in India we should say there are 
3 doctors who have done MD in sahaja yoga,

135
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:43,310
they have tried to prove that with sahaja 
yoga means the kundalini awakening; you can

136
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,840
get rid of psychosomatic diseases.

137
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,260
You get better health.

138
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,730
Also you can get epilepsy and all such mental 
diseases cured.

139
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,850
They have got MD for that.

140
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:01,860
There are 7 doctors in London who are trying 
to collect all the data about it and they

141
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,110
also want to do their MDs.

142
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:12,780
Also this in Cambridge university this gentleman 
who is already a professor of philosophy is

143
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,820
doing research on sahaja yoga.

144
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:23,140
So, it is coming to the level of the intellectuals 
and the scientists.

145
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:29,600
But, scientists have to go little deeper if 
they have to have to see any structure in

146
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,520
a microscope.

147
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,620
In the same way if we have to know about these 
things, we have to have our self-realisation.

148
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,810
Without our self realization we cannot understand 
anyone.

149
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:46,840
That’s what Kabira said, “what should 
I do the whole world is blind, what should

150
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:55,191
I tell them the whole world is deaf”; meaning 
is that the level of understanding has not

151
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:57,720
reached that subtle side.

152
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:06,710
And that subtle side has to be ?? and that 
is very simple now a days I have seen that

153
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,390
people get realization without any difficulties.

154
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:16,380
In Sydney, in Perth, in Brisbane, of all the 
places in cairns I so surprised.

155
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,780
Another surprise came from cairns which was 
something just like Russia.

156
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,550
Something out of the blue it exploded.

157
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:30,240
Such beautiful people live there; So human, 
so natural.

158
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:40,350
I couldn’t understand how certain places 
people are simple, not complicated, not conditioned

159
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,010
and not arrogant.

160
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:47,870
They have such a simplicity of understanding 
and they just take to it so easily.

161
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:53,540
Now, in Australia also we have lots of sahaja 
yogis who are working it out.

162
00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:01,110
But in the earlier, early times we didn’t 
have very good leaders who were I should say

163
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:06,070
very well motivated towards sahaja yoga.

164
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,050
And so it was going up and down.

165
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,000
But now I hope it will be again re-established 
here.

166
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,300
But, one thing we should be very honest with 
ourselves that if we have to have our benevolence,

167
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,570
we have to honest ourselves.

168
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:23,660
If you are enamored by somebody who claims 
too much, talks too much and gives you big

169
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,880
lectures and just says alright, take this 
mantra or do this and do that, all kinds of

170
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:35,670
nonsensical things; you first must go and 
see the person who has been to him.

171
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,310
What is he doing, what has he got.

172
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,500
Has he got any spiritual power or not.

173
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:49,250
Or just because he is going to that place 
you must also go.

174
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:55,900
Another problem in the west I find I must 
say is the funny that they think that if something

175
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,220
is free then it is nonsensical.

176
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,110
This is very funny surprisingly.

177
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,400
I went to Boston and they asked me how many 
rolls royces you have.

178
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,749
So people told she don’t take any money 
how can she have rolls Royce.

179
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:09,749
We are not interested.

180
00:17:09,749 --> 00:17:10,749
Its no business.

181
00:17:10,749 --> 00:17:12,350
I mean, God is not a business.

182
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,870
And divinity is not a business.

183
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,819
This we must understand that we can’t pay 
for it.

184
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:22,630
How much do we pay to the mother earth when 
she produces all the beautiful things for

185
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,630
us.

186
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,159
In the same way how much are we going to pay 
for our spirituality.

187
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:28,159
Live alone anything.

188
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:29,879
How much do you pay to Christ.

189
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:35,330
On the contrary you sold him out.

190
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,720
So this is simple thing of course Indians 
understand better.

191
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,090
But others also should understand that you 
can’t pay for him.

192
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,539
Anybody who asks money for this, you must 
know is something very serious with it.

193
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:58,080
If we I want you to take some money from you, 
you wouldn’t because you are self respecting.

194
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,940
The ones who takes money from you has no self 
respect.

195
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,409
You have retained him some sort of you are 
retainers something like that.

196
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:11,850
And one must understand this is a very important 
very point for all western people to understand

197
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,669
that you can’t pay for it.

198
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:16,690
But sometimes I think it satisfies your ego 
that you can purchase your guru.

199
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,049
You can’t.

200
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:23,250
if you can purchase your guru he can be your 
servant, not your guru.

201
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:29,049
This I want to make very clear to you because 
this is not understood in the west because

202
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:35,890
they are used to the systems where people 
sell out or give money for everything.

203
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:46,970
Now we have here, this systems which is very 
interesting and is absolutely nicely put into

204
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,360
our being.

205
00:18:49,360 --> 00:19:01,240
Below the kundalini, that is the triangular 
bone; is the centre called as mooladhara chakra

206
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,289
means the centre of mooladhara.

207
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:07,530
Now mooladhara means the support of the roots.

208
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,970
And the roots are the kundalini.

209
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:17,720
The kundalini is in the 3 ½ coil that’s 
why it is called as kundalini because coil

210
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,890
means kundal.

211
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:26,260
Now these, other centres are 6 above it.

212
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:32,649
so one thing is sure that the last centre 
does not come into play when the kundalini

213
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:33,649
rises.

214
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:40,129
So one should understand that all the functions 
of the first centre which caters to our excretions

215
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:45,370
inclusive of sex has nothing to with our ascent.

216
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:50,039
So when kundalini starts rising these functions 
just stop.

217
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,159
All these functions stop.

218
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:58,379
First centre ?? into the yellow centre which 
we call as swadhishthana.

219
00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:04,960
In a place like Canberra I think I better 
talk about this centre.

220
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,179
Because last year when I came swadhishthana 
was here so caught up that my foot became

221
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:13,309
paralysed with it.

222
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:19,740
Now the swadhishthana centre you can see that 
as got a ?? in it, yellow one.

223
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:31,340
When we use it we work out the right side 
channel which is the channel of the sun, which

224
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,440
is for our future.

225
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:42,160
And also it is for our mental and our physical 
work.

226
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:51,789
So when we think too much and we plan too 
much for the future, which is of course the

227
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:56,400
thing going on here, so this centre goes out 
of ??.

228
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:04,789
Like I would say there is another side to 
it, is another one, which is we call as the

229
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:14,860
channel for our emotion, for our desire and 
the channel that looks after all our past.

230
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:24,919
This is the centre what we call as the, this 
is the channel as we call it as the channel

231
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:32,720
of ida or is the channel of moon.

232
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,019
So the right side looks after the right sympathetic 
nervous system and the left side looks after

233
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:40,039
the left sympathetic nervous system.

234
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:47,150
And the central path is for our ascent which 
also caters to our parasympathetic nervous

235
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,150
system.

236
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:54,040
That is we can understand it this way that 
if we run fast our heart beat increases.

237
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,960
So it means the emergency.

238
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:03,000
For all emergencies the sympathetic nervous 
system goes into action and when it goes into

239
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,100
action then only the para sympathetic, central 
path reduces, brings it to normal.

240
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,230
That we can’t do.

241
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,600
We can only play about with the left or the 
right sympathetic system.

242
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,860
That means we can only go to the left side 
or to the right side.

243
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,950
That means we can only go to our past or to 
our future.

244
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:31,240
But we cannot be in the present.

245
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,639
we cannot be in the present.

246
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:44,470
And absolute can only be known in the present 
because that’s reality.

247
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,110
The past is finished, the future doesn’t 
exists.

248
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,909
Reality is when you are the present.

249
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:53,409
But how to be in the present.

250
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:54,409
That’s the problem.

251
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:58,749
For a thought rises and falls, another thought 
rises and falls.

252
00:22:58,749 --> 00:23:03,090
We are jumping on the cusp of the thoughts.

253
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:09,429
But we cannot achieve that state where we 
are in the present and that’s why we go

254
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,389
into tensions, we go into problems.

255
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:16,460
I will show you here like this is the centre; 
and on the left and the right side there’s

256
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,460
the energy moving.

257
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:23,080
Supposing you go too much on the right or 
too much on the left, there’s a movement

258
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:30,600
going on and there’s a constriction, in 
the constriction, in the centre, in the ?? centre.

259
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,990
But apart from this constriction the energy 
is exhausted.

260
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:41,429
If the energy is too much exhausted and say 
its moving on the right and there is something

261
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:45,919
happens on the left side, something emotional, 
something some accident or some shock; immediately

262
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:55,320
it looses this balance and as a result you 
develop a disease which we call as psychosomatic

263
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:02,200
that includes all your ?? diseases where the 
degeneration of muscles takes place.

264
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:09,039
Also it includes your cancer, blood cancer 
all sort of these psychosomatic diseases which

265
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,860
are incurable.

266
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:17,840
So when the kundalini rises she passes through 
this and this and sort of as if a thread is

267
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:28,659
pass through and it all gets absolutely in 
connection with the whole.

268
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:32,690
So there cannot be any malignancy because 
the connection is established.

269
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,360
And also also she nourishes that centre.

270
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:42,279
As that nourishment takes place, the person 
gets alright and he feels perfect.

271
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:44,539
This is how sahaja yoga works.

272
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:50,369
So it is your own energy within you, it is 
your own property within you; when it rises

273
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:54,110
it gives you that power that you get cured.

274
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,470
But when it is connected with the mains with 
all pervading power.

275
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,009
Its all the time flowing through you.

276
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:08,279
So even if there is any imbalance, it brings 
you to balance.

277
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:13,649
Suddenly you also feel all this in, all pervading 
power on your finger tips.

278
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:19,580
In the Quran there is one beautiful sura called 
“sajda yoga”.

279
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:26,679
In that they have described all about it that 
your hands will speak and the time of resurrection

280
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,700
and they will give witness against you.

281
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:35,520
So now we will today discuss one centre which 
is very important for all of you I think because

282
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,419
you are all working in the government and 
I know what government services.

283
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:47,200
Because my husband has been all his life the 
government service and later on he was with

284
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
the UN.

285
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,620
So I know what it means and what happens to 
them .

286
00:25:51,620 --> 00:26:00,179
now this centre swadhishthana, as I told you, 
caters for physical and mental activities,

287
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:01,179
functions.

288
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:11,740
Now the physical activity may be less, but 
the most important function of this centre

289
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,289
is to convert the fat cells for the use of 
the brain.

290
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:22,850
When we think too much then our grey cells 
are used and they are to be replaced.

291
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:29,440
So this replacement takes place through the 
function of this centre which transforms ordinary

292
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,320
fat cells for the use of the brain.

293
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:43,830
But it has some other functions also to be 
done, which are subsidiary but are very important.

294
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:52,029
So it looks after your liver, it looks after 
your pancreas, it looks after your spleen,

295
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:57,830
it looks after your kidney and part of your 
intestines.

296
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:09,070
Now, if we make this centre work so hard it 
neglects other important functions.

297
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,559
So first it neglects is the liver.

298
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:20,029
And the function of the liver is to absorb 
the poison of the body as heat into itself

299
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:24,129
and release it into the blood stream.

300
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:33,850
But once this centre neglects and doesn’t 
give energy to liver, the heat in the body

301
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,559
remains as it is and it starts rising on the 
right side.

302
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:43,249
when it starts rising on the right side it 
gives you diseases like asthama because you

303
00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:47,169
have another centre called right heart.

304
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:49,619
It can also give you a massive heart attack.

305
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:54,029
People don’t know its all due to liver trouble.

306
00:27:54,029 --> 00:28:03,570
But some how if this liver is clicked by movement 
of the left side then one can get all kinds

307
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,120
of allergies and all kinds of problems which 
are skin troubles.

308
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:15,940
So when we sit in the sun, it is not the sun 
that spoils our skins but it is the liver

309
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:24,440
which gets heated up and can’t bear anymore 
of that and that’s how you get your skin

310
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,640
diseases like skin cancer.

311
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,659
Then the second very important it has to look 
after is your pancreas.

312
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:43,179
Function of the pancreas is to dissolve the 
sugar for use of the body and give to the

313
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:49,879
other organs; supply the energy for it because 
it has the carbohydrates in it.

314
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:56,779
But when this centre is so much looking after 
one side of transforming ordinary fat cells

315
00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:04,350
into grey cells, again they neglect, creates 
a problem and you develop a horrible disease

316
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,610
called diabetes.

317
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:18,460
Now if you go the villages of India you will 
be surprised when they make tea, the cup contain

318
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,009
so much of sugar that a spoon has to stand 
at right angle.

319
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:24,389
Thats the measure.

320
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:27,960
Otherwise its not tea, its not good.

321
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,690
And they take such a lot of sugar they never 
get diabetes.

322
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:35,080
They never get diabetes because they don’t 
think.

323
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:41,960
They just live nicely, earn for the day, sleep 
off, we will see tomorrow.

324
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,409
But those people who are sedentary, who are 
working hard, thinking too much, futuristic

325
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:51,999
planning; make their centre work only for 
that purpose, really go against themselves

326
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,679
and get this horrible disease called diabetes.

327
00:29:54,679 --> 00:30:03,110
Which is ofcourse curable if the kundalini 
is there to help you.

328
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:10,269
Then the third is even a worst one which is 
coming from your spleen.

329
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:16,399
Now spleen is your speedometer or we say it 
is the one that keeps the rhythm of life.

330
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:22,409
But in this modern times you have lost the 
rhythm of life and all the time we are under

331
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:24,830
shock, something is happening.

332
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:33,200
So much so without sensationalisation we do 
not feel any, any existence of our own.

333
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:41,019
Like early in the morning you will get up, 
first you will read the news paper.

334
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:44,059
News paper means what; its a shock.

335
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:47,649
Somebody died, somebody killed, some mishaps 
n now its a hail storm, this and that something

336
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:48,649
is there.

337
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:50,869
With shocks you get worried.

338
00:30:50,869 --> 00:30:54,039
May be some of your relations are killed; 
what has happened.

339
00:30:54,039 --> 00:31:00,909
So the first thing the spleen goes into the 
jeopardy because the spleen has to supply

340
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:03,690
red blood carpuscles at the emergency of like 
this.

341
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,529
And the second shock is may be jam on the 
way.

342
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:08,049
We are time bound.

343
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:12,679
If the time is there we must reach in time, 
and if you don’t reach in time as if you

344
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:17,690
are going to be hanged or there is a already 
and order coming from death coming to our

345
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,630
?? ; that shaking conditions we live.

346
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:26,979
All the time under tense conditions that we 
must keep to time, we must keep to these norms,

347
00:31:26,979 --> 00:31:31,820
must do this; and the modern life has made 
our life so artificial so artificial, that,

348
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,039
supposing you are eating your food.

349
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,450
Now you must keep your spoon and fork in a 
way.

350
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,409
I mean God has not told you that.

351
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:47,610
But its something sort of a norm that we must 
have a fork and spoon like that.

352
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,190
Now, if you have not kept it then everybody 
laugh at you.

353
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,549
So by chance if you have not kept it you are 
in trouble.

354
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:58,440
Small small things absolutely good for nothing, 
have covered our being as good as behaviour

355
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:05,970
as something very posh as something very… 
I don’t what they will say.

356
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,929
But french will say something, english will 
say something and everybody has a different

357
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:11,929
style.

358
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:17,029
And if you do not cope with it then you are 
absolutely a rustic person, you have no manners,

359
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:18,029
nothing.

360
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:21,730
You can pass dirty jokes, you can say all 
dirty things, doesn’t matter that doesn’t

361
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,409
matter… thats all right.

362
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:29,899
You can drink as much as u like , you can 
fall on the table doesn’t matter after all

363
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:31,659
he was drunk so excused.

364
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:32,659
See.

365
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:37,270
But if you all do nonsensical things you are 
a gone case.

366
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,320
All these things way upon us.

367
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,509
Now we have to dress up like this, we have 
to be like that, if you don’t dress up like

368
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:45,119
that its out fashion .

369
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:50,159
We do not know in subtle ways that we are 
playing into the hands of these entrepreneurs,

370
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,840
just befooling us all the time.

371
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,809
And thats how this tension, what to dress 
what not to dress, you have to be formal or

372
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,989
informal, what to do what to eat, how to call.

373
00:33:00,989 --> 00:33:06,330
Even to have rapport with someone is not, 
u see, you cannot talk to someone at the same

374
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,489
level as human being.

375
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:10,749
On the contrary we think twice what should 
I say.

376
00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:18,519
We will rehearse it at home and then we face 
the person and we go completely in mess because

377
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:20,779
we think no I can’t say that.

378
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:22,399
We start on something else.

379
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,369
There is no relaxed personality and we always 
say I am not relaxed, I am tensed.

380
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:29,369
But why.

381
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:30,369
Animals are not tensed.

382
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:31,440
They live in the same city.

383
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,609
Nobody seems to be tensed.

384
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:34,399
Trees are not tensed.

385
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,039
Why are human beings tensed.

386
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:42,619
Because they themselves have made these kind 
of funny cages for themselves and they think

387
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:45,659
that this is important to me like that.

388
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:53,940
So all this leads to lots of shocks for our 
speedometer which is a poor instrument for

389
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:59,419
such a person which can’t understand and 
becomes crazy.

390
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:04,470
And when it is crazy it becomes vulnerable 
and then you get a very serious disease called

391
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,470
as blood cancer.

392
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:16,460
You will be surprised that sahaja yoga has 
cured blood cancer of many people.

393
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:21,869
Not only that but those who are certified 
thats all doctors do in blood cancer, to die

394
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:28,190
within 10 days or 1 month are still there 
after 5-6 years and doing very well.

395
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:34,730
The reason is this spleen becomes good shock 
absorber.

396
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,539
Why that I will tell you later on.

397
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:40,020
Now also you get your blood pressure.

398
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:45,179
because of this your kidneys are affected, 
your intestine goes out, so you will ?? to

399
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,270
constipation the thing.

400
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:54,810
So all these troubles come out of one that 
we think too much.

401
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,599
Now thinking cannot be stopped.

402
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,200
Thats troubles.

403
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,700
Thinking is coming all the time invading us.

404
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,660
You can’t stop thinking.

405
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,170
What should we do to stop thinking.

406
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:14,780
For that if the kundalini rises you reach 
a state, state of mind where you are thoughtlessly

407
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,780
aware.

408
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,780
There is not thought.

409
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,119
You are aware absolutely aware but no thought.

410
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:24,680
If you want to think you will think otherwise 
you wouldn’t think just you wouldn’t think.

411
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,780
And you are in that state.

412
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:33,400
That state in sanskrit is called as nirvichar 
samadhi which instantly takes place and the

413
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,680
second stage you see we call is nirvikalpa 
samadhi is doubtless awareness.

414
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,720
Where you become absolutely detached.

415
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:46,319
Like you are in the water you are afraid of 
water.

416
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:52,430
But suppose you get into the boat you can 
watch the water alrigh, quiet relaxed.

417
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:56,800
But supposing you know how to swim you can 
jump in the water and save people who are

418
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,950
getting drowned.

419
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:02,662
In the same way when that state comes in where 
you can jump and save other people and help

420
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:10,280
other people then that state is called as 
a state of doubtless awareness.

421
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:17,849
With this a person becomes extremely extremely 
powerful, dynamic.

422
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:25,750
At the same time such a person becomes extremely 
compassionate extremely compassionate.

423
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:35,359
He bcomes a person who sees everything witness 
everything as a drama.

424
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,470
He gets out of it and sees everything as a 
drama.

425
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:44,760
He doesn’t get involved into problems but 
he can see his problems clearly by which he

426
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,180
can solve them better.

427
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:54,200
And such a person then becomes a very good 
human being because he becomes righteous.

428
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,869
The are you see above that is the green area 
is the area where our valencies are.

429
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:01,450
Which are 10 valencies.

430
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:07,030
Carbon has 4 we have 10 valencies and they 
get enlightened.

431
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:12,140
They get enlightened and that is what is innate 
within us.

432
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:17,770
Like carbon has 4 religions, in the same way 
within us aer the 10 religions which are called

433
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:23,450
in sanskrit as dharma, dharma eti sa dharma 
the one we sustain within us is the dharma.

434
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:28,500
Not that we practice say something and practice 
something is not dharma is not dharma not

435
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,500
religion.

436
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:34,390
The one we sustain within us and this sustenance 
takes place when the kundalini rises she enlightens

437
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,930
that p?? and such a person becomes righteous 
absolutely righteous.

438
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:42,609
He is not bothered as to what others are doing.

439
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:49,940
He lives with his own righteousness, enjoys 
it, he enjoys his virtues and he sees the

440
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,470
good point in others.

441
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:58,789
Somehow or the other by his temperament and 
nature and his magnetic personality he attracts

442
00:37:58,789 --> 00:38:03,990
others and tries to transform them only by 
his existence.

443
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:10,900
Now christ was a very subtle deity I should 
say ?? subtle incarnation because he has said

444
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,530
though shall not have adulterous eyes.

445
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,770
though shall not have adulterous eyes.

446
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:24,190
Now I would like to know in what christian 
nation I should find such a people.

447
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:31,079
Even the eyes because when you become realised 
then you will be surprised your innocence

448
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,079
comes back.

449
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,350
Eyes become absolutely still.

450
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:42,920
And such person when he develops further, 
his even a glance of such a person can do

451
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,990
wonders because there is no lust, no greed.

452
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,630
You just watch.

453
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,359
And watching something is the biggest boon.

454
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:56,190
Suppose I see something beautiful and then 
I react as a human being I am to react.

455
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:02,500
So it is in my mind “oh God it will get 
dirty and it is not insured or something sort

456
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,540
of a nonsensical.

457
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:09,799
Supposing it belongs to somebody then I start 
thinking how much she must have paid and where

458
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:11,470
should I get it.

459
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,980
All this thoughts come to us.

460
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:21,210
But supposing I am just watching it then what 
happens like a lake which has no ripples in

461
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:25,030
it; the whole creation reflects into it.

462
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:32,950
In the same way the joy of creation starts 
pouring on you and you feel relax and happy.

463
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:35,130
You never feel your age.

464
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,280
You never feel you are travelling.

465
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,170
You are with yourself wherever you are.

466
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:45,760
So all these problems we have in modern times, 
speediness vanishes.

467
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,109
Not only that but your family life will improves.

468
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:52,150
Your society improves.

469
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,150
Your country improves.

470
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,230
Its a benevolence of the whole humanity you 
can achieve.

471
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,500
This transformation is very essential.

472
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:07,010
I am very happy that the Russian in all western 
world have taken such a strong step forward.

473
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:17,240
I know all others will also now little bit 
think about it that why, why not we? Why not

474
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,860
we seek our benevolence.

475
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,230
Why not we have this.

476
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:23,490
When it is our own power why shouldn’t we 
get it.

477
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,529
Supposing I say there is a diamond available 
here, free.

478
00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:32,849
Then not only from America but even from Greenland 
people will come here.

479
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:38,980
And I say there is a diamond within you, spirit, 
why not have it and for nothing at all you

480
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,170
just get it free.

481
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,130
So why not have.

482
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:47,859
This is what should be the attitude of all 
the people.

483
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:52,589
All over the world, but I think there are 
certain conditionings which do not help people

484
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:55,029
to get to that point.

485
00:40:55,029 --> 00:41:00,150
So we must know we have not achieved it so 
far so why not achieve it further.

486
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:04,760
If we haven’t got it why not we do it.

487
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,130
Its a times, special time.

488
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:14,420
And you should not missed out.

489
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:22,910
Not only, not only the people in Russia but 
even the government has helped us a lot.

490
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:27,950
I am quiet amazed at the wisdom of these people.

491
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:32,839
I do not know what I should give the credit.

492
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,250
They are remarkable people I must say.

493
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:40,750
And a day may come it might become the most 
powerful, the most powerful country in the

494
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,950
world.

495
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:47,400
I am really amazed way they have developed 
within themselves the depth.

496
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:55,170
There was one fellow who gave me a book which 
he has written about the mathematical calculation

497
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,170
of Shree Chakra.

498
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:01,520
In India there are very few must be knowing 
what Shree Chakra is.

499
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,710
Its very surprising.

500
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:13,730
And this is what I am telling you here in 
Australia which you must take note no doubt.

501
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:22,000
Ofcourse now your government has done one 
thing is to send some people to tape, video

502
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,580
tape me and find out, go to Russia to find 
out how Russians have got it , why we haven’t

503
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,580
got it.

504
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,950
So in this competition may be might start 
working here everywhere else.

505
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,720
But this wisdom, wisdom is needed.

506
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,720
What are we doing about our life.

507
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,960
What are we doing about it we should find 
out.

508
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,299
Where are we spending our time.

509
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:45,710
Why are we going to miss it.

510
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,520
Once you get into some terrible disease then 
you will come to me.

511
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,520
Whats the use.

512
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:56,950
You will be happy to know we have cured one 
gentleman here of aids no doubt.

513
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,109
He ?? mr.

514
00:42:58,109 --> 00:42:59,109
??.

515
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:00,109
but he had no will power.

516
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:06,849
He went back to the same nonsensical habit 
next day and then now he is dead.

517
00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:09,930
But the other day in Perth two people a husband 
and wife got cured of aids.

518
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:11,849
So I have hope about that also.

519
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:18,349
We should have will power to do little bit 
of practice of sahaja yoga and keep to it,

520
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:19,349
develop it.

521
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:23,990
I am sure they will live much longer than 
that is expected.

522
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:25,109
So may God bless you.

523
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:29,470
In this short time whatever is possible I 
have tried to put before you.

524
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:35,609
I would ofcourse like you to ask me some questions 
for few minutes and then we should have this

525
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:37,520
experience of self realisation.

526
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,789
That is very important than any of our questions.

527
00:43:40,789 --> 00:43:44,000
Because even, I am good at answering questions.

528
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,710
And even if I answer all your questions has 
no meaning because it doesn’t guarantee

529
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,450
your ascent.

530
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:54,900
What guarantees your ascent is the happening, 
is the becoming.

531
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,960
Unless and until that happens everything else 
is useless.

532
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:07,779
So its not a mental feel, its more a natural 
growth within you of that new awareness which

533
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:11,599
we call as collective consciousness.

534
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,490
collective consciousness.

535
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:20,630
That becomes part and parcel of you that you 
can on your fingertips you can feel the five,

536
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:25,609
six and seven centres on your left and five, 
six and seven centres on the right.

537
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:28,849
Your own and that of others.

538
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:34,170
So there is self realisation and also you 
have the power of collective consciousness.

539
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:37,789
Now even if you know within one months time 
you will find out.

540
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:41,950
With in one months time , that what things 
are decoding.

541
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:47,119
If you know what things are decoding, you 
can diagnose a person, you can help the person,

542
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,610
you can raise the kundalini.

543
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,109
You don’t need me.

544
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:53,720
Its like one enlightened light can enlighten 
another light.

545
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,180
Like that we can have so many people who can 
get realisation.

546
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:20,180
So may God bless you and may God give you 
self realisation.

547
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:42,859
I like to have questions from you if possible.

548
00:45:42,859 --> 00:45:45,700
Q: ??

549
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:59,380
Residual power meaning you see it a little 
complicated thing but I will say that the

550
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,380
whole being is created, alright, by three 
powers within us.

551
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:12,720
One is the power on the left hand side which 
is the power of desire, another side is the

552
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,010
power of action.

553
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:19,809
And the third is the power of ascent which 
is in the centre.

554
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:22,109
Now all this has happened.

555
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:29,859
But still one energy is not being used and 
that is the energy of kundalini which is power

556
00:46:29,859 --> 00:46:34,780
of pure desire.

557
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:38,760
Because according to economics wants are not 
sachetable in general.

558
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,670
Today we want to have a chair, tomorrow we 
want to have a table, then we want to have

559
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:46,039
a house, then we want to have something else 
and like that goes on.

560
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:48,869
we are never satisfied.

561
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:53,630
So the pure desire the power of pure desire 
is the kundalini.

562
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:54,799
What is the pure desire.

563
00:46:54,799 --> 00:46:57,830
Whether you are aware of it or not, subconsciously 
or unconsciously whatever you call it; the

564
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:03,980
pure desire of kundalini is “to be one with 
the divine”.

565
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:08,730
This is the pure desire.

566
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:14,230
Until you have fulfilled that you will never 
be satisfied with yourself.

567
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:18,730
Because thats how you know the absolute truth.

568
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:24,430
Thats how you become absolutely above all 
these weaknesses that you have.

569
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:37,260
You become the master of yourself and also 
then you jump in the ocean of joy and peace.

570
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:45,690
No questions.

571
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:49,910
Good ??.

572
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:59,780
as I have told you that there are 4000 tapes 
and they are available to you.

573
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,880
You can always listen to them.

574
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:08,000
Only thing that I have not told you, one thing 
which is important to know is this yellow

575
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,140
balloon that we have in our head is the balloon 
of ego and another one is of the blue is the

576
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,140
balloon of conditionings in us.

577
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:19,700
The conditionings we have had.

578
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:27,099
So the kundalini rises she passes through 
this crossing point and she sucks in these

579
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:28,099
two things.

580
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:32,750
Thats how our karma, our conditionings are 
sucked in.

581
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:39,380
but in childhood when we grow, upto the age 
of twelve years these two grow like that and

582
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:46,000
cover each other and the fontanelle bone area 
which is the soft bone in your childhood is

583
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,279
completely closed.

584
00:48:49,279 --> 00:48:54,349
So when the kundalini just sucks in it opens 
out.

585
00:48:54,349 --> 00:49:01,450
And when it opens out then the kundalini passes 
through your fontanelle bone area and you

586
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:04,609
can feel cool breeze coming out of your head.

587
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:07,740
We say its the cool breeze of the holy ghost.

588
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:16,950
What is the holy ghost also, you have got 
almighty and you have got a son; what about

589
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:24,720
the mother ? She is the holy ghost, she is 
the primordial mother who we call , in our

590
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,839
Indian language adishakti.

591
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:31,339
In all ancient scriptures like Greece – Athena.

592
00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:35,440
Athena , atha in Sanskrit means primordial.

593
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:41,720
Even here those people who came they call 
this river by paramata, is the same.

594
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:51,309
So this kundalini is the reflection of the 
holy ghost, while spirit is the reflection

595
00:49:51,309 --> 00:49:54,000
of the God almighty.

596
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,339
They have to meet and thats how they get realisation.

597
00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:08,839
The fontanelle bone area is opened out and 
you can feel the actualisation of baptism.

598
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,039
Its not artificial.

599
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:13,650
Its actualisation you can feel it, the cool 
breeze.

600
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:17,190
Ofcourse in the Pentecostal you must have 
read that you can feel the cool breeze of

601
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,470
the holy ghost.

602
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:21,119
Thats what you feel on top of your head.

603
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:26,730
We got photograph where sahaja yogis are sitting 
and in the photograph you see the light on

604
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:27,730
their heads.

605
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:32,210
And in some of the paintings you must have 
seen having light in their head.

606
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:37,359
In olden times when there was christianity 
at the level of gnostics where they, “gna”

607
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:42,740
also the word comes from the same as gyana 
which Shri Krishna has described as gyan marg

608
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,099
(path of knowledge) .

609
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:52,319
Gyan doesn’t mean through your brain, but 
means, again the same bodha which I told you

610
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,319
“gna”.

611
00:50:53,319 --> 00:51:02,450
Same gna is used by Thomas when he described 
christianity in his treaties on his way to

612
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:06,410
India when he wrote all this an put them in 
Egypt and which are found out and now you

613
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,440
can get that book as “gnosticis??.

614
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:14,020
”; important to read because he has ?? all 
the ideas of suffering and things .

615
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,269
Is written everything about sahaja yoga.

616
00:51:17,269 --> 00:51:20,260
He said its an experience of the self you 
must have.

617
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:26,500
Like christ has said you have to be born again, 
so we certify ourselves.

618
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,619
How can that be.

619
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:32,140
In sanskrit language a born again person is 
called dwijaha mean born again.

620
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:37,810
And a bird is also called dwija means its 
an egg and then it becomes a bird.

621
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:42,099
In the same way first we are human beings 
and then we become saints.

622
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,952
This is the second birth we should have.

623
00:51:44,952 --> 00:51:45,952
But we have to become !.

624
00:51:45,952 --> 00:51:47,930
It’s not just certificate.

625
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,840
So every body things ?? of themeselves.

626
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:54,539
The other somebody asked me question “Mother, 
why there are quarrels among religions?”

627
00:51:54,539 --> 00:51:58,839
Because they are not following what their 
originators have told.

628
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:02,170
They are just following some sort of man made 
religion.

629
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:03,740
That’s why there is problem.

630
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:08,000
Because all religions are just the same.

631
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,829
Born on tree of life at different times and 
these flowers were plucked by people saying

632
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:19,660
this is mine, this is mine and that’s why 
they are fighting.

633
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,279
These are dead flowers.

634
00:52:21,279 --> 00:52:22,800
These are not living flowers.

635
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,589
They come from the same source of spirituality.

636
00:52:26,589 --> 00:52:30,299
Christ has said those who are not against 
me are with me.

637
00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:33,220
Who are those ? In four years what could he 
do christ.

638
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,220
Its an impossible situation.

639
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,079
How people were cruel to him.

640
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:45,079
I was struggling with 7 hippies; very well 
educated hippies in England for 4 years.

641
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,270
So you can imagine.

642
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:55,010
I must give full credit to Christ atleast 
he could say so many things about reality.

643
00:52:55,010 --> 00:53:11,790
Should we have our realisaton.

644
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:15,150
(52.

645
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:38,650
57) 
There is some gentelman, another gentleman.

646
00:53:38,650 --> 00:54:05,500
?? 
I think you are little confused about it.

647
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,540
You haven’t yet seen it what happens.

648
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,540
Alright .

649
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:12,299
After the experience you talk to me about 
it then you will be alright.

650
00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:14,190
A little confused.

651
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:20,589
You see, to say that, you see I have told 
you one light can enlighten another light.

652
00:54:20,589 --> 00:54:21,589
Alright.

653
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:27,950
In a general way I must say that today’s 
sahaja yoga is something very tremendous.

654
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:30,799
Because it works amass.

655
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:36,510
Just works out, amass, in thousands of people.

656
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:43,009
So must be you are also special I must say 
or also these are special times and also that

657
00:54:43,009 --> 00:54:46,720
the divine is angcious to give you realisation.

658
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,960
All these three things put together.

659
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:59,039
But of course, I will tell you how to raise 
your kundalini as well as your kundalini will

660
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:00,039
rise.

661
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:02,200
It will take hardly ten minutes for the whole 
thing.

662
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,310
But one thing is sure, I cannot force on you.

663
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,230
I respect your freedom.

664
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:10,160
Because you have to get your ultimate freedom.

665
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,289
So I cannot force on you.

666
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:24,880
You have to ask for it in your own free will.

667
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,359
That’s very important.

668
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:33,480
It cannot be forced.

669
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,850
Q: ??

670
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:37,690
That’s what we are going to do.

671
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:40,980
That’s a very good question.

672
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:46,089
That’s the best question.

673
00:55:46,089 --> 00:55:48,049
Alright.

674
00:55:48,049 --> 00:55:58,849
So if you are ready then I have to tell you 
that there are two conditions.

675
00:55:58,849 --> 00:56:07,650
The first one is that you have to forget the 
past in this hall.

676
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:15,680
Forget that you have done any mistakes or 
so called sins.

677
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:21,859
And, you have to say in your heart that you 
are not at all guilty of anything.

678
00:56:21,859 --> 00:56:24,960
If you were guilty of something you have been 
in jail.

679
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,750
So you are not guilty.

680
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:33,500
Afterall you are human beings as I told you 
and you are capable of mistakes.

681
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:42,680
But the divine has great power of forgiveness 
and any mistake can be forgiven.

682
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:51,569
So first thing, first condition is that you 
have to respect yourself and forgive yourself

683
00:56:51,569 --> 00:56:55,200
and not to believe at all that you are guilty.

684
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,920
Its very important for self confidence.

685
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,269
Everyone can get realisation.

686
00:57:01,269 --> 00:57:03,790
But firstly one should not feel guilty.

687
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:04,790
57.

688
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:05,790
03

689
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,019
Its a myth.

690
00:57:07,019 --> 00:57:09,519
Alright.

691
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:16,670
Second myth is that we cannot forgive some 
other people.

692
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:21,330
Some people say its very difficult to forgive 
others.

693
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:25,619
But whether we forgive or don’t forgive, 
we don’t do anything.

694
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:34,549
What do we do? But if we don’t forgive then 
it starts working in our minds, working in

695
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:38,890
our temperament and we play into wrong hands 
unnecessarily.

696
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:45,710
While the person who wants to punish us is 
perfectly alright, in good health.

697
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:48,329
So this is a myth and we are playing into 
wrong hands.

698
00:57:48,329 --> 00:57:51,299
So we have to say I forgive everyone.

699
00:57:51,299 --> 00:57:56,329
Now you don’t have to think whom you have 
to forgive, what wrong he has done, how far

700
00:57:56,329 --> 00:57:57,640
you have to go, nothing.

701
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,690
You just in general you have to say “I forgive 
everyone”.

702
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:07,309
Is more important in place like Canberra.

703
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:15,809
Because I know in a place like this, this 
centre [pointing at agya] works very hard;

704
00:58:15,809 --> 00:58:18,670
thinks thinks thinks too much, this centre.

705
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:25,019
And is important to stop thinking, you have 
to say “Alright I forgive.

706
00:58:25,019 --> 00:58:26,019
I forgive.

707
00:58:26,019 --> 00:58:27,880
Just go on forgiving.

708
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,269
And you get to it”.

709
00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:34,519
Say I, I am quiet used people who are bureaucrats.

710
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:37,359
I know there situation very well.

711
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:43,589
I know them better than any body else I should 
say.

712
00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:48,160
So I have to tell you really very frankly.

713
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,950
Forgive everyone and also you know that you 
are not guilty.

714
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:57,880
Because they have always told you have done 
this mistake that mistake, and also out of

715
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,859
jealousy or whatever it is people trouble 
them.

716
00:59:00,859 --> 00:59:02,990
Then they cannot forgive.

717
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:05,319
So better forgive everyone.

718
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:12,619
Forget everything and be here absolutely free 
from all those nonsensical worries.

719
00:59:12,619 --> 00:59:15,510
Will be a good idea.

720
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:21,829
Only by doing these things you will be completely 
free I tell you to receive your realisation.

721
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:25,329
We have to take help from the mother earth.

722
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:29,880
For that we have to take out our shoes, will 
help us a lot.

723
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:37,530
Just take out your shoes.

724
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:46,599
Some people who want to come further can come 
further also.

725
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:50,490
Its very far away.

726
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:52,440
Its alright.

727
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:58,269
Makes no difference wherever you are.

728
00:59:58,269 --> 01:00:06,000
And if I said something that makes you feel 
guilty, forget my lecture also.

729
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,890
Is important.

730
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:14,250
So that means in short that we have to be 
very pleasantly placed towards ourselves.

731
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:17,390
“Prasannachitta, in Sanskrit its said “Prasannachitta”.

732
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:20,539
Must be pleasantly placed towards ourselves.

733
01:00:20,539 --> 01:00:28,509
You have to put both your feet little away 
from each other because they represents two

734
01:00:28,509 --> 01:00:29,509
energies.

735
01:00:29,509 --> 01:00:32,119
So put them on two sides.

736
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:35,789
Children will get realisation without doing 
anything.

737
01:00:35,789 --> 01:00:37,880
They are very good.

738
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,980
They are not complicated.

739
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:40,980
Alright.

740
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:44,599
He will show you what is to be done.

741
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:51,079
You can see that and after that we will take 
out our spectacles and close our eyes and

742
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:55,619
then the real awakening will take place.

743
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:59,109
Please put your left hand towards me.

744
01:00:59,109 --> 01:01:00,109
Like this.

745
01:01:00,109 --> 01:01:07,940
This represent, putting the left hand represents 
nothing but the desire to get self realisation.

746
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:14,690
And the right hand you have to use for action 
and we have to place it at different points

747
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:19,099
on the left hand side on our centres.

748
01:01:19,099 --> 01:01:21,359
So first we put it on our heart.

749
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:25,480
Thats very important because in the heart 
resides spirit.

750
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:30,509
Again I will say in the place like Canberra 
is important.

751
01:01:30,509 --> 01:01:35,180
Because they work so hard, think so hard that 
the heart becomes weak.

752
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:38,720
Its better to press your hand on your heart.

753
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:45,420
You should put under your coat will be a better 
idea.

754
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:46,420
And.

755
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:54,619
Now take down your hand into the upper portion 
of your abdomen on the left hand side.

756
01:01:54,619 --> 01:01:57,960
This is the centre of your mastery.

757
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:05,980
This is made by many great teachers, masters, 
sadgurus.

758
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:11,779
And we have to awaken it so that we become 
masters of that.

759
01:02:11,779 --> 01:02:16,119
Then you take down your hand in the lower 
portion of your abdomen.

760
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:18,770
Lower portion of your abdomen.

761
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,890
And press it hard.

762
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:31,869
Now this is a special centre for pure knowledge 
which has to manifest on your central nervous

763
01:02:31,869 --> 01:02:32,869
system.

764
01:02:32,869 --> 01:02:37,029
Then we take back our hand in the upper portion 
of our abdomen.

765
01:02:37,029 --> 01:02:43,049
Then take it on our heart.

766
01:02:43,049 --> 01:02:48,880
Now this important is that put your right 
hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder.

767
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,880
From the front.

768
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,880
Not from the back side.

769
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:56,829
Now this centre is very important because 
this is the centre which catches or get spoilt

770
01:02:56,829 --> 01:02:58,509
when we feel guilty.

771
01:02:58,509 --> 01:03:01,029
Turn your head to your right.

772
01:03:01,029 --> 01:03:02,289
Its very important.

773
01:03:02,289 --> 01:03:09,339
And this centre when is spoilt you get diseases 
like spondylitis, angina, all kinds of funny

774
01:03:09,339 --> 01:03:15,269
diseases, with the lethargic lung and lethargic 
heart.

775
01:03:15,269 --> 01:03:21,490
Now you take your right hand put it across 
your forehead.

776
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:23,609
Like this.

777
01:03:23,609 --> 01:03:27,420
And put down your head as much as you can.

778
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,539
And press it hard.

779
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,609
On both the sides.

780
01:03:32,609 --> 01:03:39,779
This is the centre for forgiving others.

781
01:03:39,779 --> 01:03:48,740
Now take back your hand say way back side 
of your head and push back your head, as much

782
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,109
as possible.

783
01:03:50,109 --> 01:03:58,960
This is the centre for asking the divine to 
forgive you.

784
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,480
Now here you don’t have to feel guilty.

785
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,690
You don’t have to count the mistakes you 
have committed.

786
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:06,490
For your own satisfaction.

787
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:09,460
You to ask the divine to forgive you.

788
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:14,910
Then you have to stretch your hand, right 
hand like this.

789
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:21,089
The palm is stretched properly and the centre 
o f the palm is put on the fontanelle bone

790
01:04:21,089 --> 01:04:26,329
area which was a soft bone on top of your 
head.

791
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:29,510
And now its to be pressed.

792
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:31,630
Put down your head.

793
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:37,690
This is important now that you push back your 
fingers and thumb fully.

794
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:38,690
Please.

795
01:04:38,690 --> 01:04:45,940
Push them back properly so that there is a 
good pressure on your scalp.

796
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:51,170
And now move your scalp slowly seven times.

797
01:04:51,170 --> 01:05:08,589
Move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise.

798
01:05:08,589 --> 01:05:11,529
Clockwise slowly with the pressure.

799
01:05:11,529 --> 01:05:14,009
Thats all we have to do.

800
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:15,009
Thats all.

801
01:05:15,009 --> 01:05:17,609
Nothing else needed to be done.

802
01:05:17,609 --> 01:05:18,609
Thats all.

803
01:05:18,609 --> 01:05:21,000
Take out your glasses if you want.

804
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,329
If there is anything tight near your neck, 
little bit loosen it.

805
01:05:24,329 --> 01:05:30,869
If there is anything tight on your waist, 
you can loosen it a little bit.

806
01:05:30,869 --> 01:05:32,700
And you have to be relaxed.

807
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,849
You don’t have to bend forward or backwards 
too much.

808
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:38,450
Sit in a proper straight manner.

809
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:39,450
Thats all.

810
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:43,020
Now remember to put your feet on both the 
sides.

811
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:50,249
And put your left hand towards me please and 
the right hand now is to go on the heart.

812
01:05:50,249 --> 01:05:56,440
Now please close your eyes and don’t open 
them till I tell you.

813
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,640
That’s all.

814
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:04,740
Now here when you put your hand on your heart 
where resides the spirit you have to ask me

815
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:06,779
a very important question.

816
01:06:06,779 --> 01:06:14,349
You may call me “Shree Mataji or Mother” 
which ever suits you and this question is

817
01:06:14,349 --> 01:06:17,599
like as if you are asking a computer.

818
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:25,060
So now ask the question in your heart not 
openly, not loudly, but in your hear; “Mother

819
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:26,940
Am I the Spirit?”.

820
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,800
Ask this question three times.

821
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,890
“Mother Am I the Spirit?”.

822
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:39,410
Ask this question three times.

823
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:57,059
Now take down your right hand in the upper 
portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

824
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:02,660
One must know that if you are the spirit you 
become your own guide.

825
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:06,599
In the light of the spirit you know the absolute 
truth.

826
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:09,380
So you become your own master.

827
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:14,190
So now ask a second question “Mother Am 
I my own Master?”.

828
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:16,329
Ask this question three times.

829
01:07:16,329 --> 01:07:30,970
“Mother Am I the Spirit?”.

830
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:37,619
As I told you I respect your freedom and I 
cannot cross over it.

831
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:44,440
And I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

832
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,069
You have to ask for it.

833
01:07:47,069 --> 01:07:53,140
Now put right hand in the lower portion of 
your abdomen on the left hand side and ask

834
01:07:53,140 --> 01:08:04,750
me “Mother please give me pure knowledge”, 
“Mother please give me pure knowledge”;

835
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:07,749
please ask this six times.

836
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:11,950
Six times because this centre has got six 
petals.

837
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:18,400
“please Mother give me pure knowledge”.

838
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:26,810
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the 
kundalini starts ascending.

839
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:34,540
So we have to now nourish our upper centres 
with with our self confidence.

840
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:41,540
So now raise your right hand in the upper 
portion of your abdomen on your left hand

841
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,540
side.

842
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:46,880
And here press it hard.

843
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:54,869
And say with full confidence ten times, because 
this centre has got ten petals.

844
01:08:54,869 --> 01:09:01,299
Ten times “Mother I am my own master”.

845
01:09:01,299 --> 01:09:03,500
Say it with full confidence.

846
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:18,150
“Mother I am my own master”.

847
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:34,529
Now we have to know that the divine is the 
ocean of knowledge and love.

848
01:09:34,529 --> 01:09:37,350
Pure love.

849
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:42,609
It is the ocean of peace and bliss.

850
01:09:42,609 --> 01:09:51,299
But above all it is a very powerful open ocean 
of forgiveness.

851
01:09:51,299 --> 01:10:02,420
So we cannot do any mistake which cannot be 
dissolved by this powerful ocean of forgiveness.

852
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:09,300
So please raise your right hand in the corner 
of your neck and your shoulder.

853
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,980
Push it back as much as you can towards the 
spinal cord.

854
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,730
And now put your head towards right.

855
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:18,820
Now here with full confidence you have to 
say, sixteen times “Mother I am not guilty

856
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:19,820
at all” .

857
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,469
Please say sixteen times.

858
01:10:21,469 --> 01:10:25,110
“Mother I am not guilty at all” .

859
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,679
Please say sixteen times.

860
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:37,110
Again I will tell you it is a myth when you 
say “I cannot forgive people”.

861
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:47,050
Whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, 
you don’t do anything.

862
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:58,790
But if you don’t forgive you really torture 
yourself for nothing at all.

863
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:06,290
So please remember that it is all a myth and 
you are not going to carry on with it anymore.

864
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:08,290
This is very important.

865
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:17,480
Because this centre is very constricted one 
and you have to help your kundalini to rise

866
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:22,610
through it by really, heartily forgiving everyone.

867
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:32,070
So now please raise your forehead across and 
please put your hand in such a manner that

868
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,560
you can press it on both the sides.

869
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:44,610
And now put down your head fully and here 
please say “Mother I forgive everyone”.

870
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:47,860
Now its not necessary how many times.

871
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:50,570
You to have really say from your heart.

872
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:53,469
If you don’t say it from your heart, this 
centre wouldn’t open otherwise.

873
01:11:53,469 --> 01:12:01,330
So please I request you again and again to 
say “Mother I really forgive everyone”.

874
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:07,390
Now don’t think whom you have to forgive, 
what mistakes they have committed.

875
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:21,380
Just say it out of your understanding that 
your realisation is higher than anything else.

876
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:31,050
Now take back your hand on the backside of 
your head and push back your head as far as

877
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:32,050
possible.

878
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:40,730
Now this is the centre for you to ask for 
forgiveness for your own satisfaction.

879
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:47,540
Without feeling guilty, without counting your 
mistakes you just have to say “Oh Divine,

880
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:55,930
if I have done any mistakes, please forgive 
me”.

881
01:12:55,930 --> 01:12:59,940
For your satisfaction.

882
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:05,280
Don’t count your mistakes.

883
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:27,139
Now stretch your hand and put the centre of 
your palm on the soft bone which is called

884
01:13:27,139 --> 01:13:33,469
as the fontanelle bone area.

885
01:13:33,469 --> 01:13:45,470
Press it hard and move it seven times.

886
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:49,480
Here again I cannot cross your freedom.

887
01:13:49,480 --> 01:14:51,719
So please say seven times while moving your 
hand “Mother please give me my self realisation”.

888
01:14:51,719 --> 01:15:07,690
Now please open your eyes and put your hands 
like this.

889
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:16,920
Now put the right hand towards me , like this 
and bend your head and see for your self if

890
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:24,540
there is a cool breeze coming out of the fontanelle 
bone area or the soft bone that you had in

891
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:25,630
your child hood.

892
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:27,280
In sanskrit it is called as brahmarandra.

893
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:34,660
Brahma means the all pervading power, and 
randra means the whole in ?? it.

894
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,570
Now see for yourself.

895
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:43,800
The hand should be little away from the head, 
above it not on it.

896
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:47,550
Some people get it very far also.

897
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:50,830
Now the left hand to be used now.

898
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:53,780
Put the left hand towards me, higher like 
this.

899
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,180
Bend your head.

900
01:15:55,180 --> 01:16:06,360
And see for your self if there is a cool breeze 
coming out of your head.

901
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,860
Now again the right hand.

902
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,239
Now see for yourself.

903
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:15,659
If there is a cool breeze coming out of your 
head once for all.

904
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:17,330
Will be higher.

905
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:18,330
Now.

906
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:25,510
Raise your both the hands and push back your 
head and ask a question “Mother is this

907
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:28,030
the cool breeze of the holy ghost.

908
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:36,170
Mother is this the power of all pervading 
divine or Mother is this the paramachaitanya”?

909
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:41,659
Ask any one of these question, any one of 
these three times in your heart.

910
01:16:41,659 --> 01:16:42,659
Please ask.

911
01:16:42,659 --> 01:16:46,790
Push back your head, Push back your head and 
the question three times.

912
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:50,600
Now raise your hands fully.

913
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,600
Fully.

914
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,409
Push back your head.

915
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:57,460
Push back your head.

916
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:00,510
Don’t miss the point.

917
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:02,040
Please don’t.

918
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,550
Push back your head.

919
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:05,980
Push back your head.

920
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:09,639
Now please bring down your hands.

921
01:17:09,639 --> 01:17:17,000
Just put the hands towards me and see if you 
can be without thoughts.

922
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,219
If there’s no thought.

923
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:28,810
Now those whole felt cool breeze coming out 
of the fontanelle bone area, sometimes can

924
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,890
be hot, some heat comes out; doesn’t matter.

925
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:33,400
But feel the breeze.

926
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,900
Or on your fingertips.

927
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:54,150
On their hands please raise both your hands.

928
01:17:54,150 --> 01:18:26,460
Those who have felt it please raise your hands 
both like this, so I will know, like this.

929
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:27,930
ya.

930
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:35,260
There are wonderful people here.

931
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:53,610
See, such a lot of you have got realisation.

932
01:18:53,610 --> 01:19:01,810
God bless you.

933
01:19:01,810 --> 01:20:04,890
But now this is the beginning.

934
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:44,400
You have to come to our centres where ofcourse 
you don’t have

935
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,150
to pay anything.

936
01:20:46,150 --> 01:21:00,969
But little bit time you have to give and master 
it.

937
01:21:00,969 --> 01:21:13,090
You all can become masters.

938
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:28,380
And there wouldn’t be any more problem of 
ill health or any problem.

939
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:48,159
And I would like to meet you all if you want 
to meet me just now.

940
01:21:48,159 --> 01:22:00,320
Because I am going away tomorrow.

941
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:40,670
This is

942
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:58,010
the last day of my working Australia.

943
01:22:58,010 --> 01:23:36,870
And next year I will be again back here.

944
01:23:36,870 --> 01:24:00,980
But you are all welcome to India.

945
01:24:00,980 --> 01:25:16,620
We have a nice tour program and also a seminar 
at the end of it.

946
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:59,670
So if it suits you, you

947
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:04,770
are welcome to come along.

948
01:26:04,770 --> 01:28:51,409
You all can come and see me if you like.

949
01:28:51,409 --> 01:29:25,540
I

950
01:29:25,540 --> 01:30:45,139
am sorry I am here only for one day.

951
01:30:45,139 --> 01:33:38,849
But next time I will be here for quiet some 
time.

952
01:33:38,849 --> 01:38:56,969
And I hope I will be able to see you grown 
up like a trees now.

953
01:38:56,969 --> 01:42:18,080
Like a see now you have sprouted now and this 
seed has to become a big tree.

954
01:42:18,080 --> 01:43:22,239
May God bless you.

955
01:43:22,239 --> 01:44:10,360
God bless you.
