1
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:11,646
Today we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

2
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:34,616
Shri Ganesha resides in Mooladhara,

3
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:41,066
on the chakra, Mooladhara chakra.

4
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:55,475
 and not on mooladhar.
In the mooladhar is placed the Kundalini.

5
00:03:55,476 --> 00:04:08,666
She is the mother of Shri Ganesh, we call
her Gauri. Yesterday you saw the picture,

6
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:29,885
the drama, how Shri Ganesha got his head of
an elephant. All these things have happened

7
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:55,925
in another world. There
are many worlds of which we know of this world,

8
00:04:55,925 --> 00:05:12,926
is a question of our awareness. Now we are
at a human awareness, and we have risen to

9
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:29,975
a higher awareness which is called as the
fourth dimension. Without Shri Ganesha it

10
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:45,736
is not possible. As you know he is the symbol
of innocence within us. This innocence never

11
00:05:45,736 --> 00:06:01,776
gets destroyed because it is eternal. But
it may happen that it will get covered with

12
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:19,374
some clouds by our mistakes that we commit.
But once you get your realization, your innocence

13
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:38,717
is re-established, it manifests. And you become
innocent, your attention becomes innocent.

14
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:51,232
It is impossible to follow your religion,
either Christ or Mohammed-Sahib or Jews, if

15
00:06:51,233 --> 00:07:09,031
you do not have enlightenment.This is one
thing they did not realize, because they were

16
00:07:09,032 --> 00:07:24,556
of a very high level people. They did not
know what is the condition of human beings.

17
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:34,922
As in the Bible is written that if your right
eye commits sins – means goes against Shri

18
00:07:34,923 --> 00:07:40,039
Ganesha- you take it away.

19
00:07:45,707 --> 00:07:54,906
Or if your righthand does anything wrong against Shri Ganesha,
 then cut it out.

20
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:05,339
Just imagine, if Christians
were really practising Christianity, they

21
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,156
all would have been without hands, without
eyes.

22
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:18,322
Because it is said that if you make

23
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:25,239
any mistakes you better cut out, yourself.

24
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,322
Christ said that you should do it, and also

25
00:08:30,323 --> 00:08:34,772
for men he was very strict, not for women
so much.

26
00:08:40,056 --> 00:08:43,822
So Mohammed-Saheb thought , that

27
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:48,289
why not say about women also?

28
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:52,256
Why not restrictthem, why only men?

29
00:08:56,222 --> 00:09:02,572
So he made strict rules for women also.

30
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:11,556
In this case he said that you should hurt the woman or hit the woman

31
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:16,521
or should try to restrict the woman, that
is on the husband.

32
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:27,539
But to do so, the husband

33
00:09:27,646 --> 00:09:34,978
himself has to be an innocent person. what

34
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:43,219
If he himself committed such mistakes, then 

35
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:50,339
What right he has got to become strict with his wife or with his sister? 

36
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:03,339
And the worst thing was, were the Jews,  

37
00:10:03,357 --> 00:10:09,199
when Moses brought the Ten Commandments, he found that the Jews were

38
00:10:09,214 --> 00:10:13,189
having a decadent society as they have now.

39
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:32,289
Nowadays we have this decadent society in America, in.. everywhere. 

40
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,721
There are no morals,

41
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,321
and nobody talks of morality. 

42
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:56,538
I feel that Sahaj is the only way where human beings can become innocent.

43
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:07,832
 Because Jews were given what you call the Sheriat (sp?). Where it was , if

44
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:15,977
you are a thief , cut your hands, cut your
nose, cut this portion, cut that portion…it is very seriuos.

45
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:38,379
I saw that it is impossible to follow them because they are too pure,

46
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:39,632
too important.

47
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:53,261
If you are Christians, you can’t have two
eyes, you can’t have your hands. 

48
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:04,341
And if you are Muslims, your wives and your daughters and your sisters are always in danger.

49
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,420
And if you are a Jew then all kinds of punishments are written for them.   

50
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:25,639
On the contrary , only

51
00:12:25,623 --> 00:12:30,489
the saints have been punished. 

52
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:34,063
All the good people are punished.

53
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:40,977
Because there are so many people who are extremely aggressive and sinful.  

54
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:51,483
And they also do not know that there is wrong with them,

55
00:12:51,474 --> 00:12:56,233
something very much against the dharma, against the religion.

56
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:08,091
With Sahaj only , you get the light of the Spirit. 

57
00:13:11,888 --> 00:13:14,388
Shri Ganesha is the Spirit within us.

58
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:24,122
And he incarnated on this earth as our lord Jesus Christ. 

59
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:35,116
But all kinds of things have been done against such great people.    

60
00:13:41,402 --> 00:13:44,958
And they made separate religions. 

61
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:51,668
None of these books have separated themselves from each other. 

62
00:13:57,398 --> 00:14:06,648
For example, Mohammed-Saheb has described about Moses, Abraham, Christ, Mother of Christ.  

63
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:21,154
So he never established another religion, 

64
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,330
he was talking about all the religions


65
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,720
woven together in one. 

66
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:45,895
But we have now people who do not believe that all the religions are born out of one tree of spirituality.

67
00:14:52,303 --> 00:14:55,853
They are not only fighting with others, but
among themselves. 

68
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:08,133
In the name of God they are killing so many people.

69
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:14,572
Innocence is the source of love. 

70
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:28,554
Like small children , when you see them sweetly dancing, you feel such tremendous love for them. 

71
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:42,232
When you see a little baby, very sweet baby smilingat you,

72
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,142
 you feel tremendous love for that child.

73
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:56,406
 If you do not respect your innocence,

74
00:15:56,406 --> 00:15:58,915
you can never be a loving person. 

75
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:09,556
And without love you cannot know truth.

76
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:23,508
Only thing is that we feel rather sometimes awkward, 

77
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:28,225
sometimes frightened, to love the innocent people.

78
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:45,435
The innocent are most harmless people. 

79
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:55,165
I do not like parents to beat their children at all.

80
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:08,377
They are in innocence do something, so you must be really kind to them, and understand them. 

81
00:17:17,145 --> 00:17:24,461
Nowadays, in Russia also, there are
many children who are born realized.

82
00:17:30,702 --> 00:17:39,144
Because you all are now enlightened, and there are so many great saints who want to be born.

83
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:51,037
But you have to be innocent yourself.

84
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:59,527
 The countries where the children are not respected, children don’t want to be born there. 

85
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:11,059
There is a minus growth in those countries.

86
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:19,027
But in a country like India, where there is so much love for children, 

87
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:23,267
they want to take birth in India though there is poverty.

88
00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:37,638
Children don’t understand money and material things.

89
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:42,463
They understand love.

90
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:50,623
If you don’t have love in your heart, Shri Ganesha cannot shine within you. 

91
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:05,509
Now the difference between a mother and a mother who is very angry with her children is this: 

92
00:19:16,336 --> 00:19:25,332
The mother who loves her child, enjoys everything she has to do for her child, 

93
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:37,649
while the mother who doesn’t love the child feels that she is doing too much, she can’t do it, it’s too much. 

94
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:52,357
If you ask her what’s the matter, she will say I have to wash this, I have

95
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:58,311
to clean this, I have to look after this child,
all kinds of stories. 

96
00:20:05,616 --> 00:20:12,704
But a mother who is enlightened will love doing all that, and enjoy it. 

97
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:21,971
She will have respect for her children, 

98
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:25,854
and she will make them respectable. 

99
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:34,078
There is no need to be harsh with your children.

100
00:20:37,451 --> 00:20:43,750
Children are very sensitive and intelligent.
 

101
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:51,808
Maybe among thousands you might find one child who is not so good.  

102
00:20:59,211 --> 00:21:04,343
But later on , they pick
up things from elders, especially from parents,

103
00:21:04,344 --> 00:21:08,093
and from the atmosphere, and they start becoming
troublesome.

104
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:34,409
That doesn’t mean that you should not control  and restrict your children, and train them.

105
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:46,401
Best way is to be yourself innocent and dharmic. 

106
00:21:50,571 --> 00:21:53,922
Ganesha is the basis of morality. 

107
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:09,208
Moral behavior, when it is lost in a society, that society becomes destroyed. 

108
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:22,392
Whatever maybe the economic advantages they have, or they have financial advantages, or political advantages,  

109
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:27,398
but, they get destroyed from within.

110
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:42,321
 For example, take the case of America, which is supposed to be an affluent country.  

111
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:54,896
Which is doubtful  to me that they are affluent, because they are indebted.

112
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:05,418
 But what is happening there?


113
00:23:06,193 --> 00:23:10,697
Small children of twelve years are killing and selling drugs.

114
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:19,534
 In some other countries in the west,   

115
00:23:21,604 --> 00:23:24,837
so many children are killed by the parents.

116
00:23:31,484 --> 00:23:39,719
 Every country which is affluent has some sort of a specialty of immorality.

117
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:52,855
They are absolutely violent people, arrogant and egoistical.

118
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:05,259
 Innocence, first of all, absolutely dissolves the ego.

119
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:15,656
 And when you talk to children they make such sweet comments, 

120
00:24:15,702 --> 00:24:21,356
such intelligent comments, that you are amazed how they are saying all these things. 

121
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:34,809
They are extremely affectionate, and extremely kind.

122
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:52,989
I’ll tell you a story of some friends went to see the grave of president of America, Kennedy.  

123
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:06,993
So the child was looking at it, you
see, and everybody was very solemn. 

124
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:18,540
Then the child turned to his father and mother and said 

125
00:25:18,814 --> 00:25:27,891
“Mommy, why should you put this president under the earth, all the worms will eat him up..

126
00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:40,464
 Why this punishment?” 

127
00:25:41,827 --> 00:25:45,900
There are so many things which you can 

128
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:53,470
see from these children when they talk, how they describe about other people. 

129
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:08,538
 One day we had gone to the airport,
and one child was doing like that, like that.

130
00:26:12,768 --> 00:26:17,934
So I said, “What are you doing?” 

131
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:23,597
He said, “I am trying to tie up these people, they are all off their heads.”

132
00:26:26,195 --> 00:26:30,994
 Like yesterday’s swadisthana chakra, they were.  

133
00:26:33,105 --> 00:26:38,021
So children see also the game, and the whole drama is absurd. 

134
00:26:45,782 --> 00:26:52,165
They are very innocent and so its the easiest thing to give them good manners.


135
00:26:57,702 --> 00:27:01,745
In the case of Shri Ganesha, you have heard about the story 

136
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:09,625
that they had given – the parents, the father specially-

137
00:27:09,685 --> 00:27:16,517
 said that the one who will go around the mother earth, I’ll
give him some present. 

138
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:30,717
And Shri Ganesha thought that look at this Kartikkeya, 

139
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:38,747
he can go faster because he’s going on this peacock, which is a bird, which can fly, 

140
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:47,083
what about me? I’m just going on a little rat.

141
00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:01,295
But as he is the source of all wisdom , in his wise wisdom he thought, 

142
00:28:01,311 --> 00:28:05,395
“My Mother is greater than this Mother earth . ” 

143
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:19,702
So he went three times around his Mother, and he got the present.

144
00:28:24,973 --> 00:28:30,922
A person who is innocent is extremely humble.
 

145
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:34,952
He doesn’t try to show off . 

146
00:28:35,683 --> 00:28:38,183
He doesn’t know how to show off.

147
00:28:39,812 --> 00:28:46,844
For example, Shri Ganesha has a little rat as his conveyance. 

148
00:28:52,003 --> 00:29:00,196
But if you see people who are show offs, they try to buy cars beyond their means, 

149
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:05,507
with big loans, just to show off that they are rich. 

150
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:21,791
This is a disease of people who are not innocent.

151
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:27,954
And people take advantage of this very much in the world.  

152
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:35,055
Like in the west, you see, they have designers. 

153
00:29:38,988 --> 00:29:42,214
And they put their stamp as designers. 

154
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:46,884
And one has to pay a lot for that.

155
00:29:49,978 --> 00:29:54,373
So if it is on the coat written the designer’s name, 

156
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:59,063
they always try to show like that, while going on the road. 

157
00:30:04,493 --> 00:30:09,916
But nowadays, they are putting the sign here, of the designer.

158
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:21,328
Is a very much in the west, not so much in Russia, but it will come. 

159
00:30:27,229 --> 00:30:30,509
And the enrepreneurs take full advantage of it.

160
00:30:35,356 --> 00:30:42,578
That way I must say Indians are very very
wise. Not all, but most of them. 

161
00:30:49,153 --> 00:30:55,939
And because they believe in Shri Ganesha, they would not
waste their money for showing off. 

162
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:08,058
So thus the entrepreneurs take full advantage of the
people who try to show off.

163
00:31:15,378 --> 00:31:20,538
Innocent person is not bothered about his
own body.  

164
00:31:23,188 --> 00:31:32,689
About any fashions or about any additions to his body, 

165
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:38,797
like people wear things
just to show off.  

166
00:31:48,578 --> 00:31:54,222
I’m just telling you because all this nonsense is coming to your country.


167
00:32:02,928 --> 00:32:08,726
I hope you people will understand that 

168
00:32:08,755 --> 00:32:16,746
the greatest quality of beauty of personality
is innocence. 

169
00:32:24,586 --> 00:32:31,816
When the innocence is lost, people play into the hands of these designers
 

170
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:34,433
who make funny clothes.  

171
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:51,098
They make clothes for women which expose their bodies. 

172
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:59,511
And the more it exposes, the more it is expensive.

173
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:12,351
And despite all the cold, they try to wear
clothes which are very scanty. 

174
00:33:17,192 --> 00:33:19,962
And you can’t even look at them. 

175
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:25,052
But they think no end of themselves. 

176
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:36,214
And all our films in the west are so horrible now that you just don’t want to see. 

177
00:33:42,202 --> 00:33:48,366
If they make some films out of children which are innocent, 

178
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,808
I tell you they can earn a lot of money.

179
00:34:07,286 --> 00:34:11,646
The foundation of dharma is Shri Ganesh.

180
00:34:15,593 --> 00:34:20,946
 If you see children, they don’t know how to 
tell lies, very difficult.

181
00:34:24,906 --> 00:34:31,122
And they say things
sometimes which might be embarassing. 

182
00:34:33,663 --> 00:34:39,375
Like one mother was saying in the presence of the
child to her husband 

183
00:34:39,507 --> 00:34:46,681
that the man who is coming in the evening, he eats like a hog.

184
00:35:01,243 --> 00:35:05,527
 So this boy heard it and when that gentleman came

185
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:09,017
and started eating , he was looking at him.


186
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:19,156
And then he says, “Mother, he doesn’t eat like a hog,

187
00:35:22,676 --> 00:35:25,410
 why did you say that he eats
like a hog?  

188
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,080
You should not tell lies.”

189
00:35:32,176 --> 00:35:35,675
And the mother was so embarassed. 

190
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:42,775
So they minimize
also, innocent person by his innocence minimizes

191
00:35:42,763 --> 00:35:46,812
the judgement of others and criticism of others.


192
00:35:52,537 --> 00:35:57,150
Because they don’t see things which normally

193
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,078
a person who is immoral can see.

194
00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:10,368
 Or who is not innocent can see. 

195
00:36:11,204 --> 00:36:17,811
I remember my own granddaughter once she saw a lady in a swimming dress. 

196
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:29,696
It was a picture. So she said “Hey, you go
and dress up properly, 

197
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:34,379
otherwise my grandma will be angry with you.

198
00:36:40,337 --> 00:36:47,196
So when you see all these small little children
talking, the way they behave, the way they

199
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:56,149
are innocent, you really enjoy because innocence
is the source of love.

200
00:37:05,227 --> 00:37:09,493
 And it is the source of joy. 

201
00:37:10,273 --> 00:37:16,813
Because if you do not have love , you
cannot enjoy anything.  

202
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:22,907
And you start criticising

203
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,460
and judging 

204
00:37:25,937 --> 00:37:30,303
and wasting your energy on nonsensical
things. 

205
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,815
Like the other day I was listening to some good music, 

206
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:44,645
and the gentleman was singing with his 
hands, a little bit more of action. 

207
00:37:55,045 --> 00:37:59,007
But he had closed his eyes and
music was wonderful. 

208
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:05,397
I really got lost into it. 

209
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:13,884
But there were some ladies who said what
clothes he was wearing, how he was putting

210
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:20,440
his hands, all these superficial things they
were saying, not the essence. 

211
00:38:26,951 --> 00:38:30,675
But innocence takes to the essence. 

212
00:38:34,196 --> 00:38:36,696
And the essence is love.


213
00:38:39,847 --> 00:38:43,655
Thus we have to understand that the quality of Ganesha 

214
00:38:43,693 --> 00:38:47,346
we must all imbibe within ourselves.


215
00:38:53,897 --> 00:39:02,047
His quality of innocence which is already
there within us has to be manifested.

216
00:39:08,217 --> 00:39:16,902
 Like I was with one Sahaja yogi in his house, and we had a meeting there of about 25 people. 

217
00:39:22,788 --> 00:39:28,811
And the meeting was over, I thought that he had said that I’ll have my dinner there.

218
00:39:29,185 --> 00:39:33,371

So I just waited for all of them to go away.

219
00:39:40,435 --> 00:39:45,130
This gentleman was in the kitchen when they
all went away. 

220
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:52,623
He came back and he said, “Mother what have you done? Why have they gone? 

221
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:55,333
I have cooked for all of them.”

222
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,246
 And tears came into his eyes.

223
00:40:05,766 --> 00:40:13,648
I was so much overwhelmed by
his generosity, by his kindness.  

224
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:27,809
And when the generosity is done innocently, you are
not even aware of what you are doing. 

225
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,681
You just enjoy your generosity, 

226
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:45,381
and you don’t bother as to see what is the reaction of another person is.

227
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:58,781
We have in our shastras description of such
people. 

228
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:08,303
Like Shri Rama, he went into the forest

229
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:22,003
and there was a very old lady of, what you
call, a tribal area. Very old, only she had

230
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:24,355
two teeth left. 

231
00:41:35,457 --> 00:41:38,249
Her name was Shabari. 

232
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:51,935
And she came before Shri Ram and offered him some
plums, you can say, pears. 

233
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:05,385
And she very innocently
told him, “See, all these I have tested with my teeth 

234
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:10,405
and those who are sour I have
thrown away because you don’t like sour ones. 

235
00:42:10,433 --> 00:42:12,065
But they are all sweet.” 

236
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:29,866
Normally in India people don’t eat anything which

237
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:35,261
has been touched by another mouth. 

238
00:42:39,913 --> 00:42:43,263
So Shri Ram says “Oh , I see, you have done this

239
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:46,923
work, so please may I have all these?”  

240
00:42:53,499 --> 00:42:56,909
But his brother Lakshmana was angry, what is this

241
00:42:56,919 --> 00:43:01,419
lady she has no manners? 

242
00:43:04,156 --> 00:43:11,524
So when she started putting this pear into the mouth of Shri Rama , he was getting even worse. 

243
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:24,845
So she said “See how carefully I have done this testing and

244
00:43:24,865 --> 00:43:30,445
you are enjoying , otherwise you would not
have enjoyed them.”

245
00:43:37,697 --> 00:43:42,429
And here Lakshmana was getting angry, very angry. 

246
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:53,176
So Shri Rama says, “Oh, what wonderful fruits, I have never eaten such fruits in my lifetime.” 

247
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:03,906
So his wife Sita she said “Why don’t you give me some?”

248
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:12,336
 He said “No, no these are for me, I can’t give you.” 

249
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:23,771
So Sitaji said that “After all, I am your wife, and you have to share everything with me.”  

250
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:34,866
So he said, “All right, as a matter of right, I am giving you.”  

251
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:41,278
So he gave those pears, those fruits to her.


252
00:44:44,362 --> 00:44:51,728
So Sita said, “What? This is just like ambrosia, such beautiful fruits I have never
eaten!” 

253
00:44:57,532 --> 00:44:59,862
So she tells her brother in law,

254
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:05,351
“See, what fruits, these are heavenly fruits!”


255
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,160
So he got tempted. 

256
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:17,133
So Lakshmana said, “Give me some to taste also.” 

257
00:45:17,952 --> 00:45:23,945
So Sitaji said “No no no, I am not going to share, after all,

258
00:45:23,939 --> 00:45:31,738
I have got it with great difficulty from your
brother, I am not going to share.” 

259
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:40,558
So Shri Rama said, “all right, give him some.”


260
00:45:42,335 --> 00:45:47,535
So this innocent old lady says, “No, I have some more, I can give him.  

261
00:45:52,885 --> 00:45:59,017
You can have your
share, I have some more, I can give him.”

262
00:46:02,088 --> 00:46:04,812
And she gave it to Lakshmana. 

263
00:46:05,912 --> 00:46:10,051
He started eating and he really enjoyed, so much he enjoyed,

264
00:46:10,074 --> 00:46:14,606
he said “My god, I have never eaten such
beautiful fruits.” 

265
00:46:23,477 --> 00:46:31,120
Even Shri Krishna, whenever he used to go to the capital of Hastinapur, 

266
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:37,970
he would not live with the kings there, with Duryodana,

267
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,330
but with Vidura, who was the son of a maidservant. 

268
00:47:01,461 --> 00:47:04,937
Because Vidura was an enlightened man

269
00:47:06,461 --> 00:47:11,993
and he used to respect Vidura much more
than anybody else.

270
00:47:23,044 --> 00:47:33,639
But sometimes a mistake we commit that we
get too much attached to innocent children.

271
00:47:38,709 --> 00:47:42,295
Give them too much importance. 

272
00:47:43,367 --> 00:47:45,867
Innocence is like a river flowing, 

273
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:54,459
but if you try to stagnate it then the children get spoiled. 

274
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:03,969
They must be respected, but one should not try to make

275
00:48:03,962 --> 00:48:09,494
them look like something very exceptional.


276
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:14,661
They are all just the same, 

277
00:48:16,005 --> 00:48:23,537
they have certain various facets, but I have seen, children are just the same. 

278
00:48:28,411 --> 00:48:31,461
Firstly, they never get bored. 

279
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:38,164
If you are innocent you will never
be bored, 

280
00:48:39,434 --> 00:48:42,512
you see beauty all the time,

281
00:48:44,824 --> 00:48:48,290
and even if you are alone you enjoy yourself.


282
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,540
It is only the grownups get bored. 

283
00:48:57,504 --> 00:49:06,017
Now supposing you are in the airport and its late, and the
plane is late. All the others, all the older

284
00:49:06,057 --> 00:49:09,989
people will be very upset. 

285
00:49:17,657 --> 00:49:23,158
But children will start playing with something that is in the airport – anything, 

286
00:49:23,558 --> 00:49:29,374
a railing is there, or a steps are there, they will go up and down, enjoy themselves. 

287
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:43,260
They don’t want to make a sort of a life miserable by just

288
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,262
bringing everything to some meticulous definition.


289
00:49:57,133 --> 00:50:00,393
I have seen in the airport many a times people

290
00:50:00,473 --> 00:50:04,839
just feeling very bored and terrible and while
the children are running up and down and playing

291
00:50:04,863 --> 00:50:08,707
and enjoying and making friends with other
children whom they have never met. 

292
00:50:19,074 --> 00:50:25,163
Only by innocence you can transcend your limited ideas.

293
00:50:32,307 --> 00:50:43,047
I have seen parents who are extremely racist. Their children take to other people in no time.

294
00:50:55,022 --> 00:51:03,168
An innocent person is like that. He
just can carry on with any type of person

295
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:08,363
without even thinking what sort of a color
he has, what sort of face he has, 

296
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:12,243
or what sort of hair he has done. 

297
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:27,095
These things do not matter. 

298
00:51:28,214 --> 00:51:30,414
These are superficial. 

299
00:51:31,346 --> 00:51:35,857
But children do not bother about superficial things. 

300
00:51:37,267 --> 00:51:42,077
They just want to see the heart of the person.

301
00:51:45,246 --> 00:51:52,612
If the person is loving, whatever may be the
race, religion, anything, children will jump.

302
00:52:01,157 --> 00:52:07,156
I’ve already told you that innocence dissolves the ego. 

303
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:14,587
Innocent person cannot be aggressive. 

304
00:52:15,347 --> 00:52:20,137
And if the aggression is there that is also very loving aggression.

305
00:52:25,374 --> 00:52:33,888
Like a child would come and say that ” Why
don’t you give my clothes to this boy?”

306
00:52:40,868 --> 00:52:47,417
And if you say, “Oh God, I paid so much
money and you want to give it to this boy?”

307
00:52:52,841 --> 00:52:59,823
So he’ll say “Alright, next time again you buy for me, but let me give this to this boy” innocently. 

308
00:53:06,649 --> 00:53:11,289
Innocent children do not have sense of possession.

309
00:53:15,339 --> 00:53:20,072
 Also they do not hesitate to share their things if they are innocent. 

310
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:32,385
But if they are brought up in a way that they show that  

311
00:53:32,396 --> 00:53:36,415
“This is yours and this should be kept as yours” all the time

312
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:44,232
put into his head that this is yours, then they start becoming possessive of their things.

313
00:53:55,486 --> 00:53:58,958
The best thing to enjoy is to live with children.


314
00:54:09,278 --> 00:54:11,314
And to be like them. 

315
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:15,884
And to enjoy them. 

316
00:54:16,884 --> 00:54:21,602
This is how our innocence gets nourishment.

317
00:54:25,192 --> 00:54:30,957
 In Sahaja Yoga I have seen, people become really very innocent. 

318
00:54:33,891 --> 00:54:40,336
Shri Ganesha who is on the backside of your head also, who is MahaGanesha

319
00:54:40,371 --> 00:54:44,006
here, starts acting on the eyes. 

320
00:54:55,779 --> 00:54:59,868
The lust and greed from the eyes just drop out, 

321
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:08,626
because you become innocent in your attention. 

322
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:15,323
So you don’t have to take out your eyes as Christ has said.

323
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:22,603
Nor you have to cut your hands. 

324
00:55:25,093 --> 00:55:27,593
Because you really become moral. 

325
00:55:30,175 --> 00:55:34,791
I don’t know how many of you know that all
of you have become saints. 

326
00:55:39,642 --> 00:55:43,424
As Ganesha was created, you are also created as innocent saints. 

327
00:55:53,692 --> 00:55:57,722
Try to respect your innocence. 

328
00:56:00,642 --> 00:56:05,442
That will make you feel young and happy.


329
00:56:10,782 --> 00:56:17,680
Is a , in India, in Maharastra, we have eight swayambu Ganeshas.

330
00:56:26,036 --> 00:56:30,898
And I have seen the people of Maharastra are quite innocent. 

331
00:56:35,263 --> 00:56:40,930
Somehow, its a very ancient country, and in that area specially 

332
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:46,730
Shri Ganesha is worshipped, so people have become very innocent.


333
00:56:54,113 --> 00:57:03,352
They have a Ganesha being established during certain time, now is the time, for ten days.


334
00:57:11,522 --> 00:57:19,389
Made out of clay and later on is put in the water, sea or river. 

335
00:57:29,638 --> 00:57:35,104
But as this Coca cola culture has also come to India, 

336
00:57:38,724 --> 00:57:46,374
in the presence of Shri Ganesha they were singing horrible
vulgar song and drinking in his presence.

337
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:58,000
These were all public Ganeshas, you see. 

338
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,758
So I warned them in two lectures, that don’t do this, 

339
00:58:02,808 --> 00:58:07,368
because if Shri Ganesha gets angry, you will get earthquakes. 

340
00:58:15,198 --> 00:58:17,616
They would not believe me.

341
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:30,954
So third year these people in a village, quite

342
00:58:30,964 --> 00:58:39,544
a big place, went to the Ganesha resurgion,
means where they put it Ganesha

343
00:58:39,554 --> 00:58:43,966
in the water, and they came back. 

344
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:57,437
And they were all drunk and they were dancing 

345
00:59:00,441 --> 00:59:02,181
in the night. 

346
00:59:03,608 --> 00:59:08,432
And suddenly this great earthquake
came in, 

347
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:15,290
and all of them were buried. 

348
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:21,413
Except for Sahaja Yogis, 

349
00:59:22,721 --> 00:59:32,491
and the Sahaja Yoga Center which was there was not at all hit by the earthquake.  

350
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:47,270
And there was a big gap round
the Center, 

351
00:59:50,777 --> 00:59:56,172
so the people ran toward the Center that they can be saved. 

352
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:04,223
But they all fell in that big gap and died.

353
01:00:09,053 --> 01:00:14,039
So on the other side, the innocence is very
powerful.

354
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:24,703
 Anybody who tries to molest or to

355
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:31,102
try to destroy somebody’s innocence is ultimately very badly punished by Shri Ganesha.

356
01:00:43,124 --> 01:00:53,572
Those people who do not worship Ganesha in their heart can become right- sided or can become left-sided. 

357
01:01:01,462 --> 01:01:05,522
If they become right-sided they get all kinds of diseases, 

358
01:01:11,362 --> 01:01:13,572
which are more physical. 

359
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:23,763
And if they become left sided then they get diseases which are psycho-somatic.

360
01:01:27,969 --> 01:01:29,715
Which are incurable. 

361
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,305
We have had some horrible people

362
01:01:34,339 --> 01:01:46,569
in our country who preached that through mooladhara chakra , through sex, you can raise the kundalini.

363
01:01:55,055 --> 01:01:57,261
And they became tantrikas. 

364
01:01:58,971 --> 01:02:04,811
People who were tantrikas did all kinds of horrible things

365
01:02:04,775 --> 01:02:10,434
in the temples they put erotics, insult to Shri Ganesha. 

366
01:02:22,618 --> 01:02:25,834
They are all now being destroyed.

367
01:02:28,865 --> 01:02:33,079
So one should never try to challenge a person who is innocent, 

368
01:02:33,104 --> 01:02:36,599
who has the blessings of Shri Ganesha. 

369
01:02:43,827 --> 01:02:52,011
Only through enlightenment one can awaken Shri Ganesha within yourself.

370
01:02:57,296 --> 01:02:59,796
May God bless you all.
