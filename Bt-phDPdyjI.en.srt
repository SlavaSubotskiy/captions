1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:08,240
Today's puja is very important for us.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,459
You all have got your Self Realization.

3
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:21,630
You have all the knowledge that is necessary 
to give Realizations to others.

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,320
You have to know what you have already.

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:35,320
That's very important, because if you do not 
try your hand and if you do not try to give

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:42,850
Realizations to others, firstly you'll have 
no faith in yourself.

7
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:48,600
You'll have no self-esteem also.

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:01:00,120
The second part is that you try giving vibrations 
to other persons, but don't get involved with

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,620
that person.

10
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,909
I've seen some people get too much involved.

11
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,480
If they give Realization to one person, they 
think they have done a great job and they

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,640
start working on that person, his family, 
his relations, this thing.

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,040
So, so far as you must have learned, that 
one may be related, one may be closer to one

14
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:39,350
person, but not necessarily he will have that 
much of chance of Self Realization.

15
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,880
Only way to grow is to be collective.

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,529
There's no other way out.

17
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:50,500
If people think that by staying away from 
ashrams, alone living somewhere they will

18
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:57,310
achieve much - that's not the way Sahaja Yoga 
is meant.

19
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:05,880
Formerly, people used to go to Himalayas and 
most of them were separated and only one or

20
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,319
two persons were chosen for spiritual growth.

21
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:18,860
Here it is not question of spiritual growth, 
it's a question of your collectivity growing

22
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,189
in you.

23
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:31,220
That is how you become a person who is collective, 
who enjoys collective, who works on collective

24
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,739
and lives with collective.

25
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:44,230
Such a person develops new kind of powers.

26
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:55,480
And these powers are such that they are very 
subtle, but they penetrate into any molecule,

27
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,390
atom or human beings, anywhere.

28
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:09,530
And their penetration is only possible if 
you have a temperament which is collective.

29
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:19,730
Without being fully collective, you cannot 
achieve that height which is very necessary

30
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,049
today for Sahaja Yoga.

31
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:29,950
As you know, there are problems and problems 
all over, as if you feel that the world is

32
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,950
going to sink.

33
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:37,730
Specially when I went to America I felt that 
"My goodness, this is a hell that they have

34
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,099
created here."

35
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:45,980
Is just a hell because they have no dharma, 
they don't believe in any dharma, completely

36
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:52,819
they worship adharma and this kind of climate 
is flowing all over.

37
00:03:52,819 --> 00:04:01,129
All over the world, you get reaction of American 
adharmic life.

38
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:04,390
And people think there's nothing wrong in 
it.

39
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:10,569
Whatever you may tell them, they will not 
believe nor they will think that there's any

40
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:11,569
verdict.

41
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:18,010
But they don't see the destruction from the 
very basis of their life, their families,

42
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,600
their societies.

43
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:31,640
The whole country, I feel, is filled with 
such ugly type of adharmic nature, that one

44
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:38,670
cannot even imagine how such ideas came into 
their heads.

45
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,850
And these ideas I need not tell you, you know 
them very well.

46
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:49,810
But if you have to save your children, you 
have to be an ideal guru yourself.

47
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:59,720
If you just talk of Sahaja Yoga and if you 
try to assume that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

48
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,520
also you try to propagate Sahaja Yoga without 
all these powers being awakened in you, it

49
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,020
would be a failure.

50
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:14,050
So, how to develop these powers within us 
we should see.

51
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:24,750
It's rather embarrassing for Me to tell you 
how you have to behave towards your Guru.

52
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,470
I think people have told you.

53
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:34,390
But naturally, spontaneously, as soon as you 
get your Realization and grow in it, naturally

54
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:40,850
you develop a very humble attitude.

55
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:54,540
Also an attitude through which you achieve 
lots of qualities of your Guru.

56
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:00,850
Now, supposing the Guru is at a particular 
height and if you try to go on to the same

57
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,440
height, nothing will move towards you.

58
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:13,670
So you must sit at a place which is much lower 
than the Guru's is.

59
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:20,090
Some people take too much advantage of My 
good nature, I should say, and so many people

60
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,290
have pointed out to Me that "You must correct 
these people, they talk to You at equal level

61
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,310
and all that."

62
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,070
I said: "They will learn a lesson, they will 
learn a lesson."

63
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:37,250
But sometimes, it doesn't work out and they 
start talking on the same manner as if you

64
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,460
are talking to your friend or to your equal.

65
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,319
First is complete humility.

66
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,640
You have to be a humble person, extremely 
humble.

67
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:57,760
Now, you check on that, when you talk to others, 
are you humble?

68
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,470
When you think of others, are you humble?

69
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:08,020
When you look after your wife and children, 
are you humble?

70
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:20,220
That's a very important thing for every person 
who thinks he is a Guru.

71
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:28,830
Humility is the first quality or, I should 
say, the ocean into which you must jump.

72
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:34,340
Some people think that "If you are humble, 
Mother, then people will take advantage of

73
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
you."

74
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,930
Nobody can take advantage of you, because 
you have to remember another point, that you

75
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,800
are protected all the time, looked after by 
Param Chaitanya.

76
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:54,230
I know you know that, but how many really 
believe that there is Param Chaitanya with

77
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,320
us?

78
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:04,640
If you really believe that there is Param 
Chaitanya, then you don't get frightened,

79
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:13,160
you don't get worried, you are not subjected 
to all kinds of nonsensical ideas also.

80
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,470
But if you think that you are not protected, 
"What will happen?

81
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:24,410
How will things happen?" then Param Chaitanya 
leaves you alone.

82
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:38,820
You have to see the whole drama, how Param 
Chaitanya works out, how It works out, how

83
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,969
you are behaving.

84
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:52,400
Supposing you are not in a proper shape and 
you try to show off too much, then what happens?

85
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,190
Then, you get the reward for it.

86
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,760
Not that I do anything, but it is the Param 
Chaitanya which will teach you a lesson that

87
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,070
you will remember, that you should have been 
little different from what you have been.

88
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,700
After all, we have to know why have we come 
to Sahaja Yoga.

89
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,210
Begin at the root of it.

90
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:22,450
We have come to Sahaja Yoga because we wanted 
to know the absolute truth, and this absolute

91
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:28,300
truth has been now known to you through your 
vibrations.

92
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:36,230
You know it through your vibrations, what 
is the absolute truth, and you should work

93
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:48,540
everything on that line, that absolute truth, 
whatever you feel on your vibrations you have

94
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,780
to follow.

95
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:55,740
Unfortunately, I have seen many people think 
that their vibrations are all right, they

96
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,710
are all right and whatever they are receiving 
on their vibrations is first class.

97
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,860
Now, how to correct that point is very difficult.

98
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,860
It comes from ego.

99
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:11,259
When you have ego, you can never find anything 
wrong with you.

100
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:15,730
And even if the vibrations are telling you 
something, it might be somebody else who is

101
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:22,370
telling you something, because you are not 
there, your ego is there and your ego is just

102
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:31,150
spoiling you and teaching you things which 
normally you would see clearly that "I'm doing

103
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,940
something wrong, I should not have done it."

104
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:44,300
In this process of correction and improvement, 
when you indulge you should see: "Are you

105
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,360
getting subtler or grosser?"

106
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,140
That is the best way to judge.

107
00:10:49,140 --> 00:11:00,570
Now, I've seen people who go on judging on 
small things like vibrations - whether this

108
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:07,900
vibration are all right or not in this tree 
or on this flowers or on this land, all kinds

109
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,320
of material things they want to see the vibrations.

110
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,360
But for what are you seeing the vibration?

111
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,610
You are seeing vibration because some sort 
of material gain.

112
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:26,990
You think that if you check the vibrations 
and the vibrations are all right, then you

113
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:34,430
are quite safe, you will not loose this, will 
not loose that.

114
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,540
It's not true.

115
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,240
Because vibrations are not meant to judge 
all these worldly things and worldly matters.

116
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,279
It's absolutely cheapening the vibrations.

117
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:50,960
You should not cheapen them, because vibrations 
can suggest things which may be detrimental

118
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,450
to your growth very much.

119
00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:00,770
Once, I wanted somebody to go somewhere, so 
he said, "I didn't go, Mother."

120
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,770
I said, "Why?"

121
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,920
"Because I saw the vibrations were very bad."

122
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,300
I said, "That's why I asked you to go.

123
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:14,650
If the vibrations were good, what was your 
use going there?

124
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:20,130
That's the reason I asked you to go there 
so that you could help but before that you

125
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,670
judged yourself, judged your vibrations and 
then you didn't want to go."

126
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:30,690
So, what happens, we want to have a easy, 
cozy life.

127
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:37,589
And all our problems must be solved by Sahaja 
Yoga, otherwise we think Sahaja Yoga is of

128
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:38,600
no use.

129
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,140
Whatever is our desire must be fulfilled.

130
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,250
So, now the desires are mostly personal.

131
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:51,040
"My child is not well, so the child should 
be all right, my husband is misbehaving, the

132
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,790
husband should be all right" or "I have no 
house, I must get a house."

133
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:04,400
See how we are moving our mind, is still on 
a very consumer society, as they call it.

134
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:11,770
We are all the time thinking, "Now I should 
have a son, now, instead of a girl" and you

135
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,130
get a son and then you blame Sahaja Yoga for 
that!

136
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:20,400
Anything that according to your desire doesn't 
work out, then you think it's Sahaja Yoga

137
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:28,170
which has done the harm and you are suffering 
because of Sahaja Yoga.

138
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:39,070
Or this faith in Sahaja Yoga gets little moving 
or we can say, in a way, it's not that deep.

139
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:47,200
But if you are deeply imbedded in Sahaja Yoga, 
then what happens?

140
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:55,140
"What may come, I will be a Sahaja Yogi."

141
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:01,200
Supposing somebody dies, normally in Sahaja 
Yoga it's difficult for people to die also,

142
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,730
I must tell you.

143
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,180
Even if they want to die, they can't die.

144
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,060
It's the Param Chaitanya which decides for 
you.

145
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:15,339
But supposing you take up a position like 
that, still you must know that that wish may

146
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:17,649
not be fulfilled.

147
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,760
If that is not fulfilled then you feel disturbed 
and you think, "What's wrong?"

148
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:34,980
But 
your wish is not the wish of God Almighty,

149
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:41,630
while Param Chaitanya is the wish of God Almighty.

150
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:52,450
Now for example I went to America, take it 
like this, and America attacked Me.

151
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,120
Negativity and troubled Me.

152
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:03,230
For all these days I'm suffering so-called, 
and I have had pain, I have had all kinds

153
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,230
of things.

154
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:10,700
But that I had to do because now the American 
Sahaja Yogis will realize how much one has

155
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:19,200
to pay to make this dumb head of Americans 
to rise.

156
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:30,440
How stupid they are and how foolish they are 
who are enamored by people who are taking

157
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,620
money!

158
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:39,430
So many people came to Me and told Me, "Mother, 
if You start saying that, this I can give

159
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:45,180
for 300 dollars, You'll get thousands and 
thousands of disciples of Yours."

160
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:50,529
I said, "They'll not be My disciples.

161
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:55,700
If they come for money, thinking that because 
I'm taking money it is worthy something, that

162
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,750
means they are absolutely stupid!"

163
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:06,050
Sahaja Yoga, you cannot get it by money, this 
is the first principle they don't understand,

164
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,420
most of them!

165
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:16,090
Most of them don't understand that you can 
get Self Realization without paying any money.

166
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:25,890
They were some Gujarati rich people in New 
Jersey and they asked questions to Sahaja

167
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:30,610
Yogis that "How is it possible to get it so 
easily?

168
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:35,900
It's not possible because it's a very difficult 
thing, all the shastras have said, everybody

169
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,670
has said, it's very difficult to get your 
Realization.

170
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,770
All right!

171
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:46,300
If so, how is it you are giving it so easily?

172
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,300
Why?"

173
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,660
Nobody knew how to answer to these people.

174
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:55,779
You should have said like this, "All right 
it is difficult, very difficult and you cannot

175
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:57,160
give mass, true!

176
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:03,620
But if somebody is doing it, then you have 
to think about it, how somebody is doing it?"

177
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:09,049
So, this kind of stupid questions are there 
and still if they go on, you have really to

178
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:13,739
tell them in a very humble way: "Sir, one 
has to be worthy also."

179
00:17:13,739 --> 00:17:21,169
So, they will run after people who are just 
making money out of them, making fool out

180
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:22,169
of them.

181
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:23,829
And they boast, "We have three gurus."

182
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,600
Somebody says, "We have seven gurus!"

183
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,789
And I wonder what must be their condition.

184
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:36,929
So the people who are extremely stupid, in 
Sanskrit they call "[SOUNDS LIKE MURLE OR

185
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:43,159
MOOHL]" people who are brainless cannot get 
their Realization, so give them up.

186
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:50,169
If they are arguing with you, you just give 
them up.

187
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,780
It's not their right to argue with you.

188
00:17:52,780 --> 00:18:00,070
Their right is to get Realization but not 
a right to argue with you, ask you foolish

189
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,720
questions and stupid questions.

190
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:08,429
But you should always remember that with that 
humility you must have your dignity intact

191
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:10,669
because you are a Guru.

192
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:18,760
Once you know you are a Guru, one thing should 
be there that you will not behave like a joker

193
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,000
all the time.

194
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,049
Your behavior will be dignified.

195
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:31,100
At the same time, it will be very pleasant 
face or a pleasant personality.

196
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,309
It won't be annoying type.

197
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:36,309
Your personality itself will suggest that 
there's something special about you.

198
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:49,480
Now, how do you develop that kind of a personality?

199
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:56,669
The biggest problem in the West is ego and 
the biggest problem in the East is superego.

200
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:03,379
Now, this ego business, I don't know from 
where it has come.

201
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:07,510
In all walk of life, they show how egoistical 
they are.

202
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:15,460
For example, I went to America and I was surprised 
that there is a racial problem, and the blacks

203
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,690
are treated in a different manner, and the 
whites in a different manner.

204
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:25,059
I mean, color is given by God and somebody 
has to be black, and white.

205
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:30,519
If everybody looked the same, it will look 
like a regiment.

206
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:37,269
There should be some variety, there should 
be some change in the face and also in the

207
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:38,600
expression.

208
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:50,489
One has to be a person carrying better or 
different expressions, otherwise you will

209
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:55,759
be bored with such a world where there is 
everybody looks the same, just the same.

210
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:03,980
But so much of racialism there that I was 
surprised that how it has worked into human

211
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,130
mind.

212
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:13,250
So, as a Guru, you must develop a complete 
detest for racialism, complete detest.

213
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:22,659
That's very easy to understand that anybody 
who has fair complexion could be a cruelest

214
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:30,100
man, cruelest woman and could be a cruelest 
mother also.

215
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,570
And the one who is black could be very kind, 
generous.

216
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,519
It doesn't go with the color, temperament 
doesn't go with the color.

217
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:45,080
But because the blacks have been ill-treated 
so much that they react.

218
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:52,989
And they react, naturally, in sometimes in 
such a manner that it is very crude and very

219
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:53,989
cruel.

220
00:20:53,989 --> 00:21:06,799
But this kind of attention, this kind of a, 
you can say, a wrong type of attitude towards

221
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,320
human beings, even towards animals they won't 
bear it.

222
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:17,919
So towards human beings to have such an attitude 
itself shows that you are not worthy of Sahaja

223
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,940
Yoga at all.

224
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:31,090
So anyone of you who has such a feeling that 
somebody is black and somebody is white cannot

225
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:36,779
be a guru in Sahaja Yoga.

226
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:42,080
Then in India we have caste system, equally 
bad and horrible.

227
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:50,080
It has no sense in it, no basis whatsoever, 
but in India we have people who believe that

228
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,190
some castes are higher and some castes are 
lower.

229
00:21:53,190 --> 00:22:01,639
Every caste people can do all the worst possible 
things, there is no demarcation for them and

230
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:06,450
every low caste can be very, very good.

231
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:13,779
We have had many great poets and Sufis in 
the lowest castes in India.

232
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,350
This castes are man-made.

233
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:22,299
You know man-made cloth doesn't suit us, and 
all these man-made ideas are not going to

234
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:31,580
suit us and it will lead us into a great - I 
wouldn't know discretion - but I would say

235
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:43,059
to a complete destruction, because hatred 
begets hatred and it goes on increasing and

236
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:44,059
increasing.

237
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:50,980
If you cannot get rid of your hatred, then, 
I would say you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

238
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,509
These are all conditionings.

239
00:22:52,509 --> 00:23:02,649
You were born in a white family, so you are 
white, you were born in a Christian family

240
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:05,749
that's why you are Christian, you were born 
in a Jew family, that's why you are a Jew.

241
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:10,080
All this is just because you were born in 
that.

242
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,370
But does that mean that you are higher or 
lower?

243
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:22,330
All the problems of the world today, if you 
see, are because of human attachment to nonsensical

244
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,769
ideas of superiority.

245
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:30,799
Only through collective living will change.

246
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:40,350
For example, I would say, in an ashram, we 
should have all colored people living together

247
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:47,399
with the equal rights, with the equal understanding 
and love and affection.

248
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:58,240
If that is not there, no use calling it an 
ashram.

249
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:07,850
Once, they asked Me, "Mother, will You come 
and give a lecture in Harlem?"

250
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,019
I said, "Why not?"

251
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:12,309
So some Sahaja Yogis said, "Harlem?

252
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:14,129
Mother, do You know what is Harlem?"

253
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:15,429
I said, "I know.

254
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:16,429
There's no harm."

255
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:19,479
They said, "You know the blacks are there 
and..."

256
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:21,830
I said, "I'm also black."

257
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:30,330
You could call Me black or you can call Me 
white, but the love is such a thing, you see,

258
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:37,750
love is such a thing that cleanses all these 
ridiculous ideas we have about other people.

259
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:45,889
To brand anyone as black and white shows that 
you have no eyes to see.

260
00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:57,970
Any person with depth, any person with loving 
heart cannot see these superficial things,

261
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:58,970
cannot see!

262
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:06,059
Today is a day where we are celebrating the 
Guru's greatness.

263
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:18,509
Now, look at all the Gurus, how they were, 
how they behaved.

264
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:26,320
We have many in India and many others many 
Sufis in other countries.

265
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:33,759
These Sufis or these saints that we had never 
believed in any caste system, never believed

266
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:35,619
in black and white.

267
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:39,669
Christ, He never believed in black and white.

268
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:44,619
Buddha never believed in black and white.

269
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:52,470
Nobody believed in any kind of man-made ideas.

270
00:25:52,470 --> 00:26:01,539
These are all man-made ideas which we have 
accepted and, even after Realization, which

271
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:06,049
I have to carry all the time.

272
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:14,659
Now, by saying, we do not get rid of it, but 
acting we can.

273
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:24,260
Just see how we work out these stupid ideas 
within us and how we can get rid of them.

274
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:35,119
Very simple is in meditation you should sit 
down and see how many people you love and

275
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:45,659
why do you love, not out of pity, but just 
with love, how much you care for others.

276
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:52,450
I've seen some very beautiful examples of 
that, but still I must say that there are

277
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:57,910
certain fixed ideas which are to be dislodged 
completely, very important for every person

278
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:03,359
who is a Guru in Sahaja Yoga.

279
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:10,299
Means he has to be a clean-hearted, open-hearted, 
loving-hearted fellow.

280
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:16,519
His heart should play the tune of Param Chaitanya.

281
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:22,960
If his heart is full of all these man-made 
ideas, I don't know what will happen.

282
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,729
Even when they transplant the heart, they 
cannot do it with a man-made, they have to

283
00:27:29,729 --> 00:27:32,200
use a real, natural one.

284
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:43,559
So you can imagine when you try to take to 
all these odd ideas, are just divisive, they

285
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:47,299
will never give you collectivity.

286
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:50,210
So, introspection has to be made.

287
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:59,970
Are we one, or we are judging each other?

288
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:05,429
Now, the judgment is quite a lot also.

289
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:15,479
Now, all this can be seen only when you live 
together, otherwise how will you know?

290
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:25,899
When you start living together, you discover, 
start discovering what is missing in you,

291
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:28,289
what is not there, what has to be there.

292
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:39,369
It is so peaceful to have a heart which is 
full of love because every movement of that

293
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:47,149
heart is so much joy giving, so much joy giving.

294
00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:59,450
There's a story of Shri Rama, that He ate 
the bers, a kind of fruit, which were first

295
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:05,470
tasted by an old lady with such love.

296
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,239
Shows what?

297
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:14,009
Shows that a person like Shri Ram Who was 
the King of the highest heritage and this

298
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:22,769
old lady who was just of the lowest caste 
gives Him these fruits with such love, and

299
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:26,250
when He eats that, He starts praising it.

300
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,139
So His wife says, "Give me some!"

301
00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:35,720
He says, "All right," but the brother is still 
half way, I think, in Sahaja Yoga, so he doesn't

302
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,690
like, he doesn't like, he gets angry.

303
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:44,769
Then She eats and She says, "Brother-in-law, 
it's wonderful fruit, I must say!"

304
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:46,269
He says, "All right, give me some."

305
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:49,299
She says, "Why should I give you now?

306
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:54,240
First you were a very much angry, so why should 
I give you these fruits to eat?"

307
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:04,979
The story shows that the level of your personality 
as Guru is judged by your clean heart, by

308
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:16,039
your loving heart, by your highest, remarkable 
personality.

309
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:22,599
In the personality it is not something that 
is to be built-in artificially.

310
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:28,409
It is not artificial; it is natural, absolutely 
natural.

311
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,129
Whatever you do has to be natural.

312
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:41,049
So, this artificiality of certain ways of 
talking or certain ways of living together

313
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,850
creates problem.

314
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:52,299
For example, we had a ashram in America, in 
New York, and there was a lady who was very

315
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:58,450
strict, everything should be tip-top, it should 
be here, the spoons must be there and the

316
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:04,159
forks should be here, and all sort of things 
and she hurt many people.

317
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,210
Not important.

318
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:15,241
These cultural, what you can call it, the 
taboos are not important in Sahaja Yoga, because

319
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:17,659
now, you have become a Guru.

320
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:23,320
Guru can stay anywhere, live anywhere, eat 
anything, any time.

321
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,789
That should be the case.

322
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:33,279
But also I've seen in Sahaja Yoga, there are 
many who are very anxious to eat food as soon

323
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,389
as it is served.

324
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:39,850
Once it happened, I was there, they had served 
the food and just they started removing the

325
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:40,850
plates.

326
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:47,289
I said, "What's the matter, I have to eat."

327
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:48,289
"Oh!

328
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:49,909
You haven't eaten, Mother?"

329
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:53,389
"No, I haven't yet touched it even."

330
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:59,690
So, you see, sort of, first it is the very 
lowest type of, we should say, desire, is

331
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,690
the hunger.

332
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,479
Now, a Guru doesn't bother.

333
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:06,720
Whatever you give, all right, whatever he 
wants not to give, all right.

334
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,950
Even if you don't give is all right, but one 
has to develop that by killing your ego.

335
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:20,929
People feel very hurt if you serve them little 
later than another person.

336
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:23,000
It's all kinds of funny things I've seen in 
Sahaja Yoga.

337
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:32,480
On the contrary it is the lowest type of, 
I should say, a desire.

338
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,019
You should not be very much catered to, if 
you want to be a real Guru.

339
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:50,349
Of course, many problems are solved, as I 
have seen so far that they do not take to

340
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:56,591
drugs, they do not take to drinking and all 
such things.

341
00:32:56,591 --> 00:33:01,740
You see, it's such a blessing, because if 
I had to start from that level, I don't know

342
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,049
how deep I would have gone, from where I would 
have pulled you out.

343
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:09,299
But that is of course a very big thing.

344
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:16,739
That is quite a nice thing but still, to make 
a beautiful life out of it which will attract

345
00:33:16,739 --> 00:33:23,969
the attention of everyone - how you talk, 
how you behave, how you love.

346
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:32,140
So, again one has to say that Guru Pada comes 
only through the love that you have.

347
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:42,759
Like they'll have, say, ten people for anything, 
for a drama supposing, and they have it only

348
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:52,429
from a particular country or from a particular 
group, then there's no fun!

349
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:54,369
There's no fun.

350
00:33:54,369 --> 00:34:03,239
For example they'll have a music group, so, 
from the particular one caste could be or

351
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:10,879
could be one religion, could be one, you can 
say, one school or anything.

352
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,309
So that shows that you are still not there.

353
00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:27,279
As a Guru, you should like every kind of culture, 
every kind of beauty and that has to be brought

354
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:29,789
in, in our daily life.

355
00:34:29,789 --> 00:34:44,990
You should not look down upon anyone for their 
color, for their race, for their status, class

356
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,230
consciousness.

357
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:53,809
All this has been shown in the lives of all 
these Guru saints who lived.

358
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:58,869
Tukarama says, "Oh God, thank God you have 
made me a Shidhul caste."

359
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:04,720
He was not but he just says so.

360
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:15,880
All of us, all the time should not be conscious 
of what has been our birth, what has been

361
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:22,359
our personality or what has been our beginning.

362
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:30,049
One should not be able to make out even who 
is the saint and who is not.

363
00:35:30,049 --> 00:35:35,819
Even people are proud that they are saints.

364
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:42,500
I was surprised in America, also, very much 
that the Russians who have gone there are

365
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,640
a very different quality people.

366
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,079
They wouldn't raise their eyes to Me, wouldn't 
raise their eyes and very deep, very, very

367
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,079
deep.

368
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,309
Vibrations were very deep.

369
00:35:53,309 --> 00:36:02,059
The reason is, I think, they have been oppressed 
during communism, perhaps, maybe, and now

370
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:09,380
they have come to America where they have 
seen so-called freedom and what nonsense it

371
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,990
is doing.

372
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:22,200
So knowing these two extremes, I think they 
have gone very deep into their own being,

373
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:29,770
and they have such strength and such unity 
among themselves.

374
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:37,069
I was surprised that I had never met them 
before.

375
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:43,289
They didn't come from Russia, they came, only 
they were there.

376
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:54,700
So, what is it that has kept them like that 
is, that they had no religion in their heads.

377
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
They had no religion.

378
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:03,020
To them, every religion is the same and they 
had no religion to follow.

379
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:12,760
So, a Guru cannot belong to any religion because 
these religions are also man-made.

380
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:19,400
They have created such a problem all over 
and they are all fighting among themselves,

381
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,599
how can they be divine?

382
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:32,220
So, you should not get involved into some 
sort of a religious bias.

383
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:41,480
I've seen it, that a Sahaja Yogi, say if he 
is a Christian, then the bias will be shown

384
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,289
that he is a Christian, you can make it out.

385
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:46,040
If he is a Jew, you can make it out.

386
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:52,740
So what's the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

387
00:37:52,740 --> 00:38:01,220
Their attention, if it goes inside they'll 
find out.

388
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:10,830
You have to dissect yourself to see what's 
wrong with you and why is it that you are

389
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:15,990
not very successful as a Guru.

390
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:22,780
The success of the Guru is: he doesn't bother 
about time.

391
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:29,740
Every time is the holy time.

392
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:34,359
For he's not bothered if somebody is late 
or has come early.

393
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:38,890
He is not a slave of watches and time.

394
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:41,290
This is also man-made.

395
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:49,480
There were no watches about, I think, three 
hundred years back and nobody was so particular

396
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,369
about the timing.

397
00:38:51,369 --> 00:39:00,890
So, first thing, he is beyond time, kalatit 
as they call it.

398
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,609
Then he is also gunatit.

399
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:09,160
Gunatit means he doesn't belong to the left 
side or to the right side or to the center.

400
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:19,500
He is beyond these three, beyond these gunas 
where he stands and sees everything in the

401
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,400
Divine Light.

402
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,700
Everything!

403
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:27,720
If something good happens to him, he said, 
"The Divine Light has done."

404
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,200
If something bad happens to him, he said, 
"The Divine light wanted this way."

405
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,720
Everything he leaves for the Divine Light.

406
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,109
He is beyond the gunas.

407
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:43,869
Like, supposing there is a person who is on 
the right side - egoistical - then he'll start

408
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:46,040
saying, "How is it?

409
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:51,599
I wanted this, this didn't work out and how...," 
he'll challenge.

410
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,130
Another will start crying, the left sided 
one that "I'm very sorry this has happened

411
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:02,630
to me, it should not have happened" and all 
that.

412
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:09,059
In the center also, he might think that "How 
far are my vibrations, how could I not know?"

413
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:10,470
and all that.

414
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:20,520
But a person who is a real Guru, he looks 
at it as a drama, as a, just a witness of

415
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
the drama.

416
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,580
"It happened, it was to happen, so it has 
happened."

417
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,210
So, what do we get out of it?

418
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:33,780
You see we get something: the lesson that 
this was not right or this was wrong, that's

419
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,780
all.

420
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:42,099
For that moment, not to go on churning in 
your head, that's all one gets and he is not

421
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:43,910
bothered about anything else.

422
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:51,930
So he goes beyond his gunas, beyond gunas 
he lives, he eats anywhere, sleeps anywhere,

423
00:40:51,930 --> 00:41:00,599
he is not bothered where he lives, he is not 
bothered whether he goes by car or he goes

424
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:08,849
by bullock cart, he doesn't feel he is being 
not honored if they give him a garland of

425
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:10,410
few flowers.

426
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:13,710
It's not that.

427
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:23,110
He is not bothered, because nothing can enhance 
his personality - nothing!

428
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:32,832
You give them something simple it's all right, 
or even if you don't give, it's all right.

429
00:41:32,832 --> 00:41:38,970
It's not he judges himself through your eyes, 
but he judges himself through his own eyes

430
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:45,290
and he sees for himself the joy of enjoying 
himself.

431
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:53,519
What is there to be so particular about anything?

432
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:59,210
What is so great to be hankering after anything?

433
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:05,900
It just works out in its own time and if it 
doesn't, it doesn't.

434
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,900
What does it matter?

435
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,799
Just think of it!

436
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:16,780
Also, in Sahaja Yoga, a Guru has to be a binding 
force.

437
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:27,359
There are two types of people, I've seen, 
which go on breaking relations.

438
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:32,130
It's very easy for them.

439
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:35,950
They go on complaining.

440
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:43,339
But there are others who have a power to bind 
people together in such a manner, in such

441
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:51,460
a sweet manner that the people are brought 
closer together.

442
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:57,510
Not that they have to forgive, it automatically 
it works out.

443
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:03,970
Just works out like that and people go on 
joining such a man.

444
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:09,069
I was surprised that in America they were 
very, very few Sahaja Yogis.

445
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:18,200
"We spend," they said, "Fifty thousand dollars 
and got fifty Sahaja Yogis."

446
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,519
One thousand for one Sahaja Yogi in America!

447
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:31,730
So, very bad shape, but still, you see we 
have to hope for them, because there are lots

448
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:36,579
of seekers and lost in the wilderness of seeking.

449
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:42,619
But I thought that maybe it's a circle.

450
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:49,029
They have to pass through this circle of stupidity 
and then definitely they will see the point

451
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:50,970
and it has happened.

452
00:43:50,970 --> 00:44:00,670
We had about four thousand people for My lecture 
which never has happened there in that country.

453
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:06,740
"Nobody has got such a lot of audience," they 
said.

454
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:13,190
But still, not many came but they got their 
Realization.

455
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:20,050
So, I think gradually, even in America it 
may start growing.

456
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:27,730
And the Sahaja Yogis must not only worry about 
their houses and where they live and all that,

457
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:30,109
but go all out to them.

458
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:35,890
I would say some of the Sahaja Yogis who could 
afford to go, should go to America and work

459
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:39,349
out this outside work.

460
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:47,220
May be if there are outsiders who come and 
talk about Sahaja Yoga, they might be impressed.

461
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:54,790
There are so many false gurus that you can't 
count them.

462
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,520
And they have accepted them.

463
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:02,190
It's very surprising, though they have suffered, 
they have lost in money, everything, still

464
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,539
they have accepted, "After all he is our guru!"

465
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:10,951
So, there is basically something wrong with 
their brains that they don't understand what

466
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:12,589
is to be expected.

467
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:16,349
I have written one book.

468
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:22,769
Perhaps it may reach them, but in any case 
you all can write your experiences and things

469
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:23,790
and can publish it.

470
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,680
Maybe it might help them to open their eyes.

471
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:34,190
While writing anything, you have to remember 
that it should show your quality of Sahaja

472
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,980
Yoga, how you are.

473
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:51,440
In that, one should not feel that you are 
putting them down or trying to say some things

474
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:58,599
which will hurt them, but say it in such a 
manner that it corrects them and helps them.

475
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:09,490
For a Guru, it is important that he should 
not have any false ideas about himself.

476
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:13,830
He might be from a poor family, might be from 
the rich family.

477
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:18,250
Whatever it is, he should not be conscious 
of that.

478
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:27,359
Because, once you become that ... See, look 
at Kabira, he was just a weaver, look at Tridas,

479
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:37,010
he was just a... what you call that?

480
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,010
Shoemaker.

481
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,619
See, in India these are very low castes, supposed 
to be.

482
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:41,869
He has written beautiful poetry.

483
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:48,069
Then Namadeva, he was a tailor, just think 
of that.

484
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:55,670
All these people have written the same thing 
with such great beauty of poetry.

485
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:57,460
How have they achieved?

486
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:03,869
Because, now they have entered into that great 
realm of spirituality.

487
00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:09,700
You people also write some very good poetry, 
I know.

488
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:15,990
But some of the people who have written good 
poetry turned out to be very obstinate, very

489
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:16,990
egoistical people.

490
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:18,660
This is something I couldn't understand.

491
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:25,269
You are writing here a beautiful poetry and 
here you are full of ego.

492
00:47:25,269 --> 00:47:29,359
So, from where this poetry is coming, God 
knows.

493
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:39,430
So, first of all is yourself, your personality 
has to be something that people should say,

494
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:47,000
"This is the real Guru we have met."

495
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,440
For that, you know very well, you don't have 
to give up your family, don't have to give

496
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,440
up anything.

497
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:05,529
But ego, if it is still there, I don't know 
what to say, but you must get rid of it completely

498
00:48:05,529 --> 00:48:10,380
and collectively also, ego should be driven 
out, collectively.

499
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:17,609
It's a thing that, people are egoistical secretly 
within themselves but sometimes it shows,

500
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:26,269
it's a very subtle nonsensical disease that 
people have and they just indulge into it.

501
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:36,700
On this day of Guru Puja, I have to say now 
that one has to work very hard, very hard.

502
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:46,710
The most important thing is how much you have 
dedicated your life, your time to Sahaja Yoga.

503
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:49,460
Then only you will achieve that state of Guru.

504
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:59,880
Look at Me, I'm a house wife and I have my 
family's responsibilities, problems, but despite

505
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:10,009
that, I'm all the time thinking about Sahaja 
Yogis, Sahaja Yoga and all that is this emancipation

506
00:49:10,009 --> 00:49:13,920
of human beings in the whole world.

507
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,630
Not only here or there, in the whole world.

508
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:29,670
So, that should be your widened vision, not 
for only your school, college, or university,

509
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:36,390
your this or that but a very wider vision 
one should have and that you have to develop

510
00:49:36,390 --> 00:50:32,730
through your working into every type of circumstances, 
every type of problems you have.

511
00:50:32,730 --> 00:51:00,819
Once you develop that kind of a personality, 
then

512
00:51:00,819 --> 00:53:30,920
you'll 
be amazed how you can help so many people.

513
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:48,740
I know there are so many Sahaja Yogis here 
who are worthy of praise and really I love

514
00:53:48,740 --> 00:54:07,920
them very much and they also love Me very 
much, but one should always see that, as you

515
00:54:07,920 --> 00:56:07,380
are now going to be the Gurus, you have to 
be careful not to think that you are a Guru.

516
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:43,049
You should never think you are a guru already.

517
00:56:43,049 --> 00:56:58,700
Once you start thinking again Mr. Ego, the 
guru, comes up.

518
00:56:58,700 --> 01:00:36,390
So, once you decide that "I'm nothing, I'm 
nothing, I'm just a little ripple in

519
01:00:36,390 --> 01:01:31,680
the heart of my Mother."

520
01:01:31,680 --> 01:07:16,730
If such a humble feeling you get, then, all 
your problems can be solved and things will

521
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:46,609
work out.

522
01:07:46,609 --> 01:10:43,960
Because your attention and your behavior is 
going to impress other people, nothing else.

523
01:10:43,960 --> 01:11:14,250
Whatever you

524
01:11:14,250 --> 01:13:04,590
may try, it is you

525
01:13:04,590 --> 01:20:18,920
who

526
01:20:18,920 --> 01:23:24,240
is going to get Sahaja Yoga further.

527
01:23:24,240 --> 01:35:49,700
There is so much to be said about how to become

528
01:35:49,700 --> 01:39:56,690
a good Guru and all that

529
01:39:56,690 --> 01:40:35,250
but

530
01:40:35,250 --> 01:41:46,280
I think I'll keep it for next Guru Puja.

531
01:41:46,280 --> 01:51:44,880
Thank you very much.
