1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:09,800
Yesterday I told you about the Void, the dharma,
which one has to establish.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:18,330
In modern times, people have used their freedom
to such an extent, you see, they have moved

3
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,500
so much to this extreme or to that extreme.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:30,450
They have left their central path and have
accepted and identified themselves with such

5
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:40,920
an extreme ideas about everything, that it
is rather difficult to convince people that

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,890
they have lost their way.

7
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,559
All extremes are wrong.

8
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:53,210
Moderation is the way we really solve the
problem.

9
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,789
But human race is such that everybody starts
running very fast, you see, and there’s

10
00:00:57,789 --> 00:00:59,699
a competition set in: who goes first to hell.

11
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,329
[Laughter, She laughs]

12
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:11,909
It’s not only in one direction, you can
take up any direction, but all these directions

13
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:19,120
are linear.

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:30,780
They move straightforward and coil back and
go down – any movement of that kind.

15
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,420
For example take our, say, industrial development.

16
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:44,000
We started our industrial development without
understanding the whole, the world as a whole,

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,210
that the whole world was created by God, not
a part, one country.

18
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,560
Without understanding the relationship with
the whole, when we start moving industrially,

19
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,329
we created industries, and to pamper them
we had to create other industries.

20
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:11,460
Then also to keep the hungry machines working
out, we had to feed them with something.

21
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:22,670
And thus we created a horrible system of extracting
things from the Mother Earth, using them.

22
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:29,040
We have so many things, but we do not have
the thing which is your Spirit.

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:37,780
We never thought that, after all, all this
matter is for what?

24
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,019
All these things are for what?

25
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:40,019
For comfort?

26
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:46,780
That also, if not done in moderation, we are
going to be ruined, completely ruined.

27
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:54,540
We’ll become like worms.

28
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,590
The Mother Earth is available to you, that
doesn’t mean that you should be indiscriminate

29
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,819
and use it for your comfort.

30
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:07,780
She’s there for your comfort, no doubt,
She’s the comforting element we have got,

31
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,599
the greatest comforting element.

32
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,659
But we do not know how to use Her for our
comfort.

33
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:23,680
The way we use Her is by taking out, extracting
Her.

34
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,820
Now if I say that, the other extreme would
be: “We’ll have no possessions, nothing,

35
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,390
live, hang by the string, some shoestring
somewhere”.

36
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:36,910
[She laughs] There are people who believe
in such a thing also, who want to live on

37
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:49,739
a shoestring and have all kinds of diseases,
physical, mental, because they are living

38
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,450
abnormally, in such a way that they do not
relate themselves to the Mother Earth at all.

39
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:03,100
Either you abstract completely whatever She
has, or take away all Her flesh, blood, everything,

40
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,040
and otherwise you have nothing to do.

41
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,800
These are two extremes!

42
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:18,889
And once you start doing like that, you find
that you become slave to both ways, because

43
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:25,130
you start forming habits with the help of
this matter.

44
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:31,200
Habit formation is slavery, complete slavery,
even a habit formation like fasting.

45
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,090
Now some people have to fast.

46
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,160
Who has asked them to fast I don’t know.

47
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,000
What is the need to fast for people who are
already suffering from liver troubles and

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,280
thin like sticks?

49
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,139
It’s all right, somebody has to fast because,
supposing he has too much weight, or say they

50
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:50,610
want some rest to the stomach, is all right.

51
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:57,710
But this fasting also can become such a habit,
such a habit, that the day you do not fast

52
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,740
you’ll say, “Oh!

53
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,180
You have done the greatest crime on the Earth.

54
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,130
Oh God, I did not fast on Thursday, I should
have fasted."

55
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,360
In India we get so many mad people like that.

56
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,669
[Laughter] They go crazy because they have
not fasted.

57
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:14,930
There are some who get crazy because they
have not eaten their food.

58
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,590
I mean they are all right, but if they have
not taken their lunch, for them it’s the

59
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:26,930
greatest injury, the greatest injustice done
to them that they have not been able to take

60
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,950
their lunch.

61
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:38,940
The matter starts enslaving you and your mind
becomes a slave of that matter.

62
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:46,160
You do not know in what way this Mother Earth,
which is there to give you the ultimate, She’s

63
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,720
the one who resides within you at the Mooladhara
Chakra to give you the innocence.

64
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,770
She gives you the innocence.

65
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:02,830
Instead of taking that essence of Hers, the
innocence, what you take is the matter which

66
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,830
is dead.

67
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,460
The living principle of Mother Earth is innocence,
Her magnetism, Her gravity.

68
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:19,930
Instead of that, what do you take out of Her
is this matter.

69
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,319
Either you run away from it, or you run towards
it.

70
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,430
Nothing in between.

71
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:35,090
Now matter is there for you to use, no doubt;
but to use so that you do not get dominated

72
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,710
by it, because you are the supreme thing God
has created.

73
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,169
You are the supreme-most thing; all the elements
are working in you.

74
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:50,979
There’s no animal in the world who has all
these elements working in such a beautiful

75
00:06:50,979 --> 00:07:00,340
fashion that you develop your own will, your
own freedom.

76
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:08,120
It’s such a intricate process which has
worked out a human being, which we don’t

77
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:15,250
realize, where you develop your own will,
your own freedom.

78
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:24,460
But again, with your own will what do you
do is to lose your freedom all the time.

79
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,960
For example, take a person who indulges in
luxuries.

80
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,919
I mean he is idiotic sometimes, I mean he
really becomes an idiot the way he goes on.

81
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,440
I mean you can see that he’s an idiot and
stupid fellow.

82
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,979
The another one, he will say that this luxury
is – indulgence fellow is very, very idiotic

83
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:42,979
and stupid you can see.

84
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:44,229
So he says, “All right, let me give it up."

85
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:49,789
He goes to another extreme, to such an extreme
that he becomes a dry person, absolutely dry.

86
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:54,910
The innocence is in the centre.

87
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:01,090
For example, the best use of the Mother Earth
is to watch Her working.

88
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,259
Watch the nature.

89
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:06,319
Watch every tree, what beautiful personality
every tree has.

90
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,810
Every leaf of the tree stands against the
sky.

91
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:15,879
I mean it’s such a poetry to feel Her with
your feet.

92
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,169
How soft She is when She produces flowers
for you.

93
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:23,000
You have to learn so much from what She does.

94
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,879
She creates a flower to emit fragrance, to
give, to give, to give.

95
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,710
She just gives.

96
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:39,450
Her innocence doesn’t bother as to what
you are, whether you deserve it or not, whether

97
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,990
you are a good person or a bad person or what
use you are going to put Her resources, She

98
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,910
just gives.

99
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,820
She doesn’t judge you.

100
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,250
Nirvaj – it flows.

101
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,740
The capital flows without any interest.

102
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:07,190
It just goes on flowing and flowing and that’s
the word of nirvaj is.

103
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:15,010
It doesn’t think to whom She is giving to,
whether they deserve it or not, if they are

104
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,840
sinners or they are this or that.

105
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,440
But now it is for you to use your wisdom.

106
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:31,140
And She has created this deity [Ganesha] of
wisdom within you, and you have to keep that

107
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,350
deity awakened.

108
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,480
He came, incarnated on this Earth as Jesus
Christ.

109
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,340
Look at Him.

110
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,140
Look at His life.

111
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,990
How He lived.

112
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:57,440
He was a carpenter’s son; He lived like
a carpenter’s son.

113
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,240
He didn’t amass money.

114
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,250
And what a dynamic life in thirty years of
His age!

115
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,480
What a dynamic life, out of which He spent
only four years in the public.

116
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,830
With all our indulgences and with all our
comforts, with all our movements and aeroplanes

117
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:21,640
and all this, how many there are who have
created such a dynamic life?

118
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:29,260
What dynamism have we been able to show, the
dynamism of the Mother Earth.

119
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:37,880
“We must have this, we must have that, we
must get this, we must enjoy this,” All

120
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,980
right.

121
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,160
But what is the ultimate?

122
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,630
I mean how much we have been able to absorb
it and what have we – giving others, what

123
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,170
is our fruit of this tree that we are?

124
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:55,640
The reason is, we have lacked wisdom.

125
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,850
He was wisdom.

126
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:02,930
He is the One who emits wisdom, who balances
our ego, superego, everything.

127
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,630
You know where He stands, that Deity.

128
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:13,190
But the people who followed Him, or who called
themselves Christians, where is the wisdom

129
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,360
gone?

130
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,880
Wisdom is one thing lacking in all of them.

131
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,360
What is the reason?

132
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,640
Because we just thought that He was crucified
because He was a poor Man?

133
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,410
Or I don’t know what we thought of Him.

134
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,690
I can’t understand human beings, what is
the lesson we have taken from His life?

135
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:41,210
And the Christian nations have advanced so
much materially.

136
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,200
Can you imagine?

137
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:52,210
They do not know that poverty is such a blissful
thing sometimes.

138
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,230
And then now a reaction has started.

139
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,360
I’m sure reaction will also take you to
another extreme, you’ll miss the point.

140
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,070
It’s like a madman running to one end and
when he goes from there he runs to another

141
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,070
end.

142
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,620
Have you ever seen a wild boar running?

143
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,130
Have you ever seen a wild boar running?

144
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:15,340
You see, it’s very easy to get out of the
way of a wild boar because he just runs straightforward,

145
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,500
till he meets some opposition.

146
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Straightforward.

147
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
He wouldn’t see this side, that side.

148
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,570
If you can just keep away from the line from
where he’s moving he will not hit you.

149
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,580
Then again he comes back in the same way.

150
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,330
Goes this way, comes back.

151
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,040
[Laughter]That is our movement has been about
ourselves.

152
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,830
What have we done out of our life?

153
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,450
Let’s see.

154
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:47,130
While we are capable, we are the seeds which
are going to render the real fruits.

155
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:52,380
We are capable, you know now that.

156
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,270
And that is why first of all we have done
the greatest harm to ourselves by ruining

157
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,250
all our sustenance within ourselves.

158
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:06,450
As I told you the other day in the lecture,
that how we have to maintain our sustenance.

159
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:17,350
I hope it was not too much for you to – if
you feel that I was trying to tell the people

160
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:23,390
also they say, a group of people who think
this is all conditioning.

161
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:31,370
Actually, we are so confused in modern times
about everything.

162
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:39,250
Supposing a plane has to take off, all its
parts are to be in a proper proportion, are

163
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,790
to be tied together to the main body.

164
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,030
Otherwise everything will go helter-skelter,
isn’t it?

165
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:58,430
Now if you have to jump into your unconscious,
all your parts of the being should be attached

166
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:08,650
to the gravity of the body, to your sustenance,
otherwise you’ll go helter-skelter.

167
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:15,790
Will you say that a – putting the plane
in that way is conditioning it, for its freedom?

168
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:22,720
You have much more freedom when it is properly
done.

169
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,700
A person who is properly prepared for this
flight, has much more freedom than people

170
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,710
who think that one nose is lying this, and
ears are lying on the other side, then eyes

171
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,950
are going on the other side, his mind is going
on the third side, his stomach is going on

172
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,950
the other side.

173
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,950
[Laughter]

174
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:43,420
Here he is listening to Me and he’s thinking
of his food.

175
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,070
His eyes are looking at something else.

176
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,720
His feet are moving.

177
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,050
He’s jumpy.

178
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,710
There’s no proper binding.

179
00:14:54,710 --> 00:15:08,840
And that’s why the conditioning has a word
in Sanskrit language as samskara.

180
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,930
Samskar.

181
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:20,810
Now “sam” means “good, beautiful,”
or you can say “which are good to your Spirit."

182
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:29,040
Even to add to that they can say “susamskara,”
means “good conditionings,” where you

183
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,810
are to be chiselled out.

184
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:48,180
And in that chiselling, if you understand
it is for not only your good, but for your

185
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,180
flight, then you do not give everything to
the winds.

186
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:58,980
And this is the biggest mistake we have committed,
when we started on the flight of our freedom.

187
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,910
How can you have your freedom when you are
bound by everything?

188
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,930
You must go to the pub in the evening.

189
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,910
You must go for your dancing [Laughter].

190
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,279
You must see a friend who smokes and must
smoke with him.

191
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,790
You have to attend a party where you have
to drink.

192
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,370
You must sleep at some particular time.

193
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,510
Because you cannot sleep, so you must take
pills.

194
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:32,560
You have to have girlfriends or boyfriends,
spend money on their – I don’t know what

195
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,980
you call – dates, and things like that.

196
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,900
I mean, how frivolous the whole thing sounds
to Me.

197
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,230
Same thing in India.

198
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:50,890
I mean they have other frivolities.

199
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:56,110
But when you understand through your Self
Realization your self-esteem, then you try

200
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:01,100
to think: “Then what have I done of my life?”

201
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:07,170
You are like diamonds thrown into dust.

202
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:12,190
You must find out your relative relationship
with all these useless things where the money

203
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:20,670
is wasted, you are frittered away, your time
is wasted, everything wasted, just find out.

204
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:26,670
Once you discover that, then you start detaching
yourself from that.

205
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,419
But first and foremost thing I’m sorry to
say – it is may call conditioning or anything

206
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:43,740
– are these important things are, ten things
I told you the other time.

207
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:51,480
Now all the gurus, all the gurus who came,
say from we can start from Socrates, then

208
00:17:51,480 --> 00:18:01,910
Abraham, Moses – this is the Guru Tattwa,
is the principle of master, primordial masters.

209
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:06,730
The principle is born again and again.

210
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:13,150
In India we can say the Adi Nath, we had one
Adi Nath, the Guru long time back.

211
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:25,180
Then we had Dattatreya, we had Janaka, Nanaka,
Sai Nath.

212
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:39,140
We had in the Middle East Mohammed Sahib,
Lao Tse in China, Confucius – all these

213
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:53,160
great Principles of Gurus who were born, they
had one job to do is to establish your dharma.

214
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,530
Their job was not to give you Realization,
you must understand, everyone has one’s

215
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,530
own job.

216
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:04,050
See Mine is a horrible job [She laughs] because
I have to do everybody’s jobs.

217
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,920
But Their job was just to establish your dharma.

218
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:13,530
They came at that time, in those places where
it was needed the most.

219
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,170
So these ten principles as I told you, They
established.

220
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:23,690
They are created in the Void, as you see here
the Void part, this part is made out of the

221
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,530
water element.

222
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:34,890
So whatever miracles They did, had something
to do with water, like They could create water

223
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,530
anywhere they wanted to.

224
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,730
They would not cure people.

225
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:51,870
All of Them have created water in the desert
or in the places where …like in … Nanaka

226
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:59,040
has created a Panja Sahab they call it, everywhere
They have been able to create water.

227
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,190
Whatever They touched, They could create water
out of it.

228
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:14,070
Water is the life, life force which sustains
us; without water we cannot live, that is

229
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,450
the sustenance.

230
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:27,040
But, They actually are symbolized in an ocean,
in the ocean, because They give us the salt,

231
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,950
the salt of life, which gives us the sustenance.

232
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,860
If you see the salt, if we do not have salt
in our body, we’ll have no sustenance.

233
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:41,880
Christ has said, “You are the salt."

234
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,202
Who are these “you”?

235
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:47,790
Are the people whom I was facing yesterday
and today.

236
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:52,750
You are the gurus of today.

237
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,990
But see with how many powers you have come.

238
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,990
Just think of it.

239
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,380
These Gurus did not have to give Realization.

240
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,780
You can raise the Kundalini, you can give
Realization, you can cure people.

241
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,570
Today Djamel asked Me that: “Mother did
They have the powers to cure?”

242
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,350
I said, “Powers They might have, but They’d
never use that power because They were not

243
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:18,220
supposed to do; They were just to sustain
and imbibe these great principles."

244
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:27,920
They did cures, specially the last Guru was
Sai Nath, He did cure people.

245
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,810
But Djamel himself has cured a lady who was
dying, absolutely.

246
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,460
Doctors had given up hopes and he cured her.

247
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:40,790
Now she is out and she’s gone to India.

248
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:51,050
Just think of it, that you have all the powers
of these gurus, though – though in dharma

249
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:59,520
you are still failing.

250
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
You are not absolute.

251
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,240
You have to get it corrected, your dharmas
are to be corrected.

252
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,590
Now what is dharma within us, is our attention.

253
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:20,860
As our attention is, you can make out the
dharma of a person.

254
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,360
Religion doesn’t convey that word.

255
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,450
Dharma means the one which sustains you, “Dharayeti
sa dharma”, the one which sustains you.

256
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:33,420
Your dharma is the way your attention is.

257
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:40,590
To have a complete balanced attention is just
like the aeroplane, completely balanced and

258
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,590
fully developed.

259
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:51,330
If you have an imbalance in your dharma, the
first and foremost thing is fanaticism.

260
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:57,210
If you are a fanatic, then you are the greatest
adharmi ever born.

261
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,900
Dharma is balancing.

262
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:11,840
First and foremost is to know that all the
dharmas belong to one lotus: Nabhi.

263
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:18,110
Nabhi has got ten petals and these ten petals
are the ten sustenance within us.

264
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:25,170
If you see that the Nabhi has got ten petals
– Nabhi center, the solar plexus, which

265
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,910
manifests all of solar plexus.

266
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:34,780
And if your, these ten sustenance are correct,
your attention will be so balanced.

267
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:41,670
Unless and until a flower is balanced it is
not going to blossom out into a fruit.

268
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,830
First is the balance.

269
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:49,570
All fanaticism of any kind, of condemning
any religion or any incarnation is against

270
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,570
dharma.

271
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,630
That gives you an imbalance.

272
00:23:53,630 --> 00:24:00,690
That means you have not understood the essence
of dharma because you are blind.

273
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:09,380
To say that there’s something wrong with
what Christ has preached is as wrong as saying

274
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:18,440
that there’s something wrong what Moses
has preached, or Dattatreya has preached,

275
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,440
or Nanaka has preached.

276
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,809
Actually, Mohammed Sahib thought that He has
said whatever was necessary, so that there

277
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:29,560
is no need for Him to come back.

278
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,960
But when He saw these horrible fanatics, even
today they are, He thought, “Baba, better

279
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,170
let Me take again the birth, what to do now
with these madcaps?

280
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:47,640
The thing that I preached, they are just going
against it.

281
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,320
Because I said I will not come, so they are
becoming such fanatics."

282
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,350
He had to take His birth because, you see,
human beings are such foolish things that

283
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,980
these incarnations don’t know what to do.

284
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,530
You don’t know how they will behave!

285
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:11,670
So He took His birth again as Nanaka on this
Earth, and His own daughter, Adi Shakti, was

286
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,500
born as His sister.

287
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:20,750
What Nanaka was preaching throughout and throughout
was this: that Hindu and Muslims are the same

288
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:26,730
in the eyes of God, and that you all combine
together and become one.

289
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,760
If there is anything that He has taught or
Kabira has taught is this and this and this.

290
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,820
But look at the Sikhs, the way they fight
the Muslims; and look at the way the Muslims

291
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,140
fight the Sikhs in India.

292
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,290
We have created two nations out of it.

293
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,190
Imagine!

294
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:48,700
What He preached is just the opposite people
are doing about it.

295
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,602
How do you explain I don’t understand.

296
00:25:51,602 --> 00:25:55,650
I mean when somebody has said, “This is
light,” how do you make it darkness I can’t

297
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,650
understand.

298
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:02,570
This is the speciality of human beings, is
to create darkness out of light.

299
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:13,380
Now this dharma that They preached, is preached
by all of Them, and They have been particularly

300
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:19,370
against all that goes against awareness, because
if your attention is not all right your awareness

301
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,970
will not be all right.

302
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:28,610
And so They were very anxious – all throughout,
all of Them – that They preached that don’t

303
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,960
take anything that will reduce your awareness.

304
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:40,059
That’s why They were against alcoholism,
They were against drugs and things like that.

305
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:45,840
There were no cigarettes at the times perhaps,
when Mohammed Sahib came in, so He didn’t

306
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,250
say, “Don’t take any cigarettes,” because
cigarettes came later on.

307
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,340
But Nanaka said, “No cigarettes at all."

308
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,010
Now you are finding out that cigarette causes
cancer.

309
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:00,980
“It only causes cancer, it’s all right,
doesn’t matter, because cancer – at the

310
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,120
most the body will die again you’ll be born
again.

311
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
Doesn’t matter."

312
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,059
It’s not that.

313
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:13,761
That creates a problem in the Vishuddhi, so
bad that you cannot get your Realization so

314
00:27:13,761 --> 00:27:21,380
many of you, takes time, and your poor Mother
has to work for your cigarette enjoyment for

315
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,710
days together.

316
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:28,740
I’ve worked very hard, you know that.

317
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,740
Then the drug people.

318
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,610
They have enjoyed their drugs very nicely.

319
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:39,740
They have been taking drugs, you see, enjoying
themselves, going high, or whatever they call

320
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,740
it.

321
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,000
Ask Me.

322
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
How much I had to work, with tears in My eyes
because I know you are saints, you are meant

323
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,050
to be higher people, and how much I had to
struggle to get you out.

324
00:27:54,050 --> 00:28:02,330
Can you imagine, for four years I was struggling
with six hippies in London [laughter].

325
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,620
Six only.

326
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:10,420
And first lot came to Me who were really pleased,
they had done a good job out of themselves.

327
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:17,820
The only advantage was they had taken LSD
and all that so they were on supraconscious

328
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,050
level, and they could see only light coming
out of Me, they saw all supraconscious things,

329
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,350
lights and things and all that, so they stuck
on to Me.

330
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:30,850
Or I stuck on to them, all right, but they
also stuck on to Me.

331
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,880
Today they are one of the best Sahaja Yogis
we have here.

332
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,620
They are the topmost Sahaja Yogis.

333
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:45,480
They are the most beautiful Sahaja Yogis we
can say, because they were saints I could

334
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,850
see their Spirit shining.

335
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:58,940
I could not lose that sight, worked very hard
for them.

336
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,940
They are saints.

337
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,800
They got lost into drugs because they thought
they are seeking.

338
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,500
They did not do it out of fashion.

339
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:08,730
In India you see, when the Indian young people
see you taking drugs, they think, “Oh must

340
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,730
be something great."

341
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,210
You see, it’s very fashionable nowadays
in India for young people to take drugs and

342
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,210
wear jeans.

343
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:19,070
They think by that they are getting sophisticated
[laughter].

344
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,550
But they don’t know why you did it, they
really do not know.

345
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,410
They don’t know that you did it in seeking.

346
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:29,740
They are such foolish Indians, you see, that
they are doing it because they think that

347
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,620
it’s very fashionable, you know.

348
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,210
Everybody will call them “up-to-date”
[laughter].

349
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:41,679
They don’t know why you left your homes,
why you became like this.

350
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,780
They don’t know the deeper side of your
life, they just see superficially.

351
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:53,640
And it’s very common now in the universities
and things, this has started in a big way.

352
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,309
But they are no good for Sahaja Yoga, useless
people trying to copy.

353
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:04,080
How can they copy your seeking, that depth?

354
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:17,820
That’s why these people were very much against
all those things that dulls your awareness.

355
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,350
Even now I have seen people who have been
taking drugs and all that, in Sahaja Yoga.

356
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:26,020
As soon as they see Me they start, “haah,”
sleeping.

357
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,690
They go into sleep.

358
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:36,780
Because immediately, as soon as you start
taking these drugs or all these alcohols,

359
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,720
you move towards your left side, or to your
right side.

360
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,350
Mostly to your left side.

361
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,710
Alcohol specially, left side.

362
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:50,090
By moving your left side, you see, you go
into your collective subconscious, you cross

363
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:59,910
over to your Ida Nadi and goes beyond your
subconscious into collective subconscious.

364
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:00,910
You become very non-aggressive, no doubt.

365
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:07,890
It is also because of too much of consciousness
that you are egoistical, you have started

366
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,720
doing this.

367
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,740
You thought that “Oh, our ego is too much."

368
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,850
You can’t see your ego, so you said, “No,
let’s have some drinks."

369
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,120
By that you go on the other side.

370
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:24,490
When you start moving too much towards the
left you know what happens: you get possessed,

371
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:30,850
because there are satanic forces let loose,
you get caught up.

372
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:37,040
Now when you come to Sahaja Yoga after that,
you are always dragged, you always feel the

373
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,460
heaviness at the back, all of you.

374
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:46,640
Left Agnya, not the right – superego.

375
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:58,190
You feel very sleepy; you feel like crying,
weeping all the time; you feel very much frightened;

376
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:04,400
you cannot take any decision; any question
comes in, any problem comes in you shudder.

377
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:11,790
It’s an escape, escape from reality.

378
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:20,290
Say the reality is in this room, if you run
away from this room, this way or that way,

379
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:28,390
you are running away from reality.

380
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:38,470
I would say, after war, so many people died,
perhaps, perhaps, who were dissatisfied souls

381
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,210
and in a very bad condition.

382
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:51,990
Hitler was a satan, real satan, and all these
forces were let loose later on by these gurus

383
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:59,340
or whatever it is, and they captured you,
perhaps, that you took to these things.

384
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,780
These are extremely injurious to our being.

385
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:07,830
I went once to Trichu.

386
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:14,390
They had invited Me and all these people came
in big cars to receive Me, I was quite surprised

387
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,400
that seldom – Sahaja Yogis are never very
well-off people I mean, to that extent that

388
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,670
you’ll have cars after cars.

389
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,990
I said, “What business do you do all of
you?”

390
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,760
They said, “You see, actually we are all
people growing tobacco."

391
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,110
And I said, “Very nice."

392
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,299
They are growing now, you see, not only eating
but growing also.

393
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:34,820
And I said…

394
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:40,570
In their houses you’ll be surprised, they
had tiles made in England, they had taps made

395
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,570
in England.

396
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,309
All these ancient things that you have had
which you treat as antiques today, they all

397
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:47,190
had everything with them made in England [laughter].

398
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,799
I said, “Made in England.

399
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,799
How do you get all these things in here?”

400
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:54,110
The things you do not have here they had it
there.

401
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,280
I said, “How did you get it?”

402
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,900
He said, “We are exporting tobacco to England."

403
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:06,059
I said, “Very nice, what a nice work you
are doing, exporting tobacco to England."

404
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:07,570
I said, “Don’t you think it is sinful
to do like this?

405
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,139
Don’t you know as Indians that tobacco is
against religion?”

406
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,710
He says, “We know but we don’t take.

407
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,389
And if you give it to others [laughter], then
it’s nothing wrong."

408
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,940
It’s like a person who owns all the race
course says, “I never see.

409
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,550
I never put my money on a horse.

410
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,010
I just collect.

411
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,020
I’ve never seen a race course."

412
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,840
That sort of a person, that sort of a, attitude
they had.

413
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,450
So I said, “Very nice.

414
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:35,470
You are exporting all your tobacco to England."

415
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:38,400
I told them, “Don’t do it.

416
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,879
You are very near the sea, and sea is the
guru, he will teach you a lesson of the worst

417
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:44,879
type.

418
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,090
I’m telling you today, now it is in the
attention of the sea.

419
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,119
Believe Me.

420
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,159
Remove this.

421
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,830
Do not send any tobacco.

422
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,970
Do not grow, you can …”

423
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:55,710
They said, “What should we grow?”

424
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,040
I said, “You can grow very good cotton”.

425
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,370
There were three-four people who took Me seriously.

426
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,990
They said, “All right, Mother, we will grow
cotton."

427
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:07,609
And they really started making a big money
because they produced very long threads, just

428
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:10,380
like Egyptian cotton they started doing.

429
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,110
The rest of them didn’t like Me.

430
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:17,330
They didn’t thank Me, they didn’t come
to see Me off at the station – all their

431
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,130
cars were just fizzled out.

432
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:25,090
I thought I had to take a taxi to go the station
now [laughter, She laughs].

433
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:29,190
But can you imagine, within one year’s time,
there was a typhoon.

434
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,680
And there was another thing going on.

435
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:39,750
These people were exporting this to England,
and selling tobacco, the… you see the cheap

436
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,940
type tobacco, you see whatever are the remains,
the molasses you can call it, they were selling

437
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:51,010
it to the poor people; and poor people were
taking that very concentrated, eating that.

438
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:56,240
So they took to black magic spiritualism.

439
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,609
All of them were doing black magic.

440
00:35:57,609 --> 00:36:02,820
In their small little huts they were sitting
doing black magic – can you imagine?

441
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,620
– in their villages doing black magic.

442
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,750
And the sea got so angry with the typhoon.

443
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:21,810
You might have heard about the big floods
in that area.

444
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,810
I must warn Brighton people [laughter].

445
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:34,850
The sea is taking a respite now, you just
see that, because you are insulting the sea,

446
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:40,550
all the time you are insulting him.

447
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:45,619
This holiday-making now – it’s a disease
with the western people.

448
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:46,619
Holiday.

449
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:52,420
There’s a girl in Sahaja Yoga, her sister
also comes sometime, she was to have a baby,

450
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:57,650
she is a lady doctor, sister – she has gone
for a holiday, without any heart.

451
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,650
She had a caesarean, can you imagine?

452
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:05,620
All the Sahaja Yogis putting all their attention
to the birth of the child, and this lady has

453
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,650
very nicely gone for a holiday because holiday
she must have.

454
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:14,280
You see without holiday, she is nowhere.

455
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,600
It’s all programmed; you must go for a holiday.

456
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,570
What have you achieved by going to holidays
I would like to know, what wisdoms?

457
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:27,150
Except for sitting in the sun, getting a skin
disease, and a skin cancer for Me to cure.

458
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:31,940
What is the need to go in the sun such a lot
I don’t understand.

459
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,040
What are you achieving?

460
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,359
Your healths are going from bad to worse.

461
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,360
Your forefathers had much better health than
you people have.

462
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,000
Despite all these health things you are doing,
what is your health?

463
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,790
Your livers are out.

464
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,790
If you…

465
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:48,940
That’s nice, I’m happy the sun is coming,
now you’ll give up your alcohol.

466
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,100
Let the sun scorch you, then you’ll give
up your alcohol.

467
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,100
Otherwise you will not.

468
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,810
Here, you go in the sun, sit there, take all
the alcohols there, drink all wine – in

469
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:03,950
the presence of the sea.

470
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:11,680
No wonder all these oil tankers are breaking
there and spoiling your health resorts.

471
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,680
That will happen.

472
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:21,510
You have no consideration for the sea is there,
is your guru and you are drinking like mad.

473
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:26,240
Nude women sitting down there tanning themselves.

474
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,360
What’s this nonsense going on?

475
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,790
I mean I don’t understand what is the need
to tan your body like this?

476
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:36,360
Who has told you that you look beautiful?

477
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,610
You look ghastly with that.

478
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,180
I really tell you, you look ghastly.

479
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:46,070
Here you are discriminating on racial points
[laughter], saying that people are dark, why

480
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:50,359
are you darkening yourself I can’t understand,
what is the wisdom [laughter, She laughs]?

481
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:51,800
You know going to the other extreme.

482
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,730
All right, once in a while you sit in the
sun, do something, is all right.

483
00:38:55,730 --> 00:39:03,720
But what is the need for you to be so extremely
concerned about your holidaying, and in the

484
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,580
holiday drink, fight with wife, come back
and have a divorce.

485
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:15,450
Always after a holiday, the after-effects
of the alcohol you can see very clearly.

486
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:21,410
In India, thank God we do not go out for holidays
at all, we don’t believe in holidaying,

487
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,320
at all!

488
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:29,100
At the most if you have to go somewhere, we
go to some festival or to somebody’s marriage

489
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:35,010
or something; if there is an occasion only
then we move out of the houses, we are gruhasthas,

490
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:39,900
we settle in the family, gruhasthas who stays
in the gruha, householders.

491
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,520
We are not like vagabond gypsies all the time
moving about.

492
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,050
It’s all right once in a while, just to
enjoy a picnic or something.

493
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,410
I mean you are not scouts all your life.

494
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,910
Yes, it’s so maddening, you don’t know.

495
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:59,020
My husband’s office there are two great
executives, British, they cycle down to the

496
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,020
office.

497
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,250
It looks so odd, you know, with half-pants
[laughter].

498
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:08,970
With such a big office, how will it look,
two half-pant people coming down, with a half-pant

499
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:15,910
and perspiring and smelling and everything.

500
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,920
It is absurd!

501
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,740
[Laughter]

502
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:25,310
But there is something behind this all-frantic
effort, is you are seeking something.

503
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:32,100
Some people think that by going to holidays
you will achieve something.

504
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,810
I mean music, what have you achieved in music
now, I don’t understand.

505
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:41,100
By going to these holidays, if you have achieved
this kind of music which shatters every part

506
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:50,750
of your skin, I mean when I hear it, you know,
the whole vibrations go on, jamming into it

507
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,750
(?).

508
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,780
And your bad livers, think of that at least,
bad livers, your skin diseases, your skin

509
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,650
cancers.

510
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:03,740
All this in the presence of the guru, the
sea.

511
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,910
Can you imagine?

512
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:10,810
There is no auspiciousness in this, you do
not understand.

513
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,900
The sea is to be worshipped.

514
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,650
It’s a temple.

515
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:24,020
It teaches you, it has given you such a lot.

516
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:29,510
Think of the sea, what it has given you.

517
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,210
Without the sea, what would have been your
condition?

518
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,349
In England specially.

519
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:40,250
It taught you challenge, it gave you ideas
how to go abroad, it has given you such a

520
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,250
lot.

521
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:45,400
All your wealth comes from sea and what are
you doing about your Lakshmi?

522
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:51,330
And do you know, the Lakshmi Tattwa which
resides in the centre, is born out of the

523
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,330
sea.

524
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:56,730
Actually he is your grandfather.

525
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:02,930
Do you have any respect for him?

526
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:08,590
So much to learn, from the sea, from the guru.

527
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:11,710
It never leaves its boundaries.

528
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,290
It keeps to that.

529
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:20,230
If you try to press the sea from one side
it will show on the other side, somewhere.

530
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:26,250
Such a huge thing, it gets all the water from
all over the world, but it keeps its boundaries.

531
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:31,880
It never crosses it, unless and until you
press it.

532
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:39,990
That’s the sign of a magnanimous great personality:
it keeps its boundaries – I mean, so far

533
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:48,460
and not that – The dignity of it is – I
don’t know if there’s a word like maryada

534
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:55,040
in English language – is the boundaries
of decency and decorum.

535
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,790
Then it gives you the rain.

536
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:07,570
It gives you the basis of your food.

537
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,920
Sea is the father.

538
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:22,110
And where do they meet, really in the most
beautiful way, the sea and the Mother Earth?

539
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:32,410
They meet at the Sahasrara on the Himalayas
where all the clouds freeze and cover completely

540
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:37,619
the Mother Earth, where there is snow all
over, on the Alps.

541
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:40,619
It’s complete purity.

542
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:55,609
These are too subtle things for people who
are not seeking, but I’m talking to seekers.

543
00:43:55,609 --> 00:44:07,240
You have to be subtler people to understand
the beauty of the sea, its poetry of a guru.

544
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:14,550
When it roars, you see, the roaring of the
sea challenges you: “Come up my child, come

545
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:19,500
up my disciple, come up, come along."

546
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:26,800
To Me sea is like a father.

547
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,010
I’ve traveled by sea so much, so much.

548
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:36,780
And anytime I have traveled it has carried
Me like a very gentle mother.

549
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,870
Never a bad weather, such a nice weather.

550
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:41,870
Always.

551
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:46,320
It’s so kind, it’s so kind to Me.

552
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:52,190
Once I was coming from Japan and they said,
“There are typhoons coming."

553
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,109
Five typhoons were coming.

554
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,640
They never touched My ship.

555
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,640
Nowhere.

556
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,240
People were amazed.

557
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:05,320
And we were coming to Bombay from Colombo,
when we turned round it was monsoon.

558
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,490
They said, “Now."

559
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:07,640
The captain was quite amazed, you see.

560
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,960
He said, “But now, you cannot help it.

561
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,800
The wind will go in the other direction and
we are going to have a bad time."

562
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:20,030
But what a smooth lake, just like a mirror,
beautiful!

563
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:24,010
Just like a gentle mother.

564
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:28,160
It carried Me on its sari I felt.

565
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,400
So beautiful.

566
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:40,320
And such a sea you insult, because you are
ignorant, because you are blind.

567
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:45,300
I wish the sea forgives you, but gurus do
not forgive easily.

568
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,480
Mother is different.

569
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,310
Gurus are hard taskmasters, you see.

570
00:45:52,310 --> 00:46:00,000
They normally do not forgive you.

571
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:09,180
Now you have heard about Ravi Shankar who
is a great musician who plays sitar.

572
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:17,390
I know when he was studying in – he was
in the beginning a student of Allauddin Khasa.

573
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:23,980
Allauddin Khasa was a Realized soul, a great
man, a genius, a genius he was.

574
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,980
Absolutely a real guru, you should say.

575
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,810
He never drank.

576
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:39,000
And he was a Muslim but a worshipper of Kali,
you see, and all that.

577
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,570
And he used to call Me “Ma."

578
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:43,570
Mother.

579
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:50,550
I was with My father who was the political
adviser to that State, Maihar [Madhya Pradesh].

580
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:56,490
I mean you could see he was really so subtle
in everything!

581
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:06,920
And he used to play that big drum which he
said the best is produced in Maihar, that’s

582
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:13,201
why he settled down there, what we call is
the “pakhawaj” is the very big drum, you

583
00:47:13,201 --> 00:47:14,201
see.

584
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:15,201
He used to play tremendously.

585
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:18,539
He used to just go on into such echoes and
beautiful rendering.

586
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:22,170
And he was a master of so many things like
sarod – his son himself is Ali Akbar Khan

587
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,170
Sahib.

588
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:24,830
His daughter Annapurna is a great singer and
all that.

589
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:36,650
And I remember Allauddin, when we went there,
he used to respect My father very much and

590
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:48,470
– also because My father was a great connoisseur
of music and a Realized soul himself, a great

591
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:49,470
man.

592
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:55,680
So, once he was going to play the pakhawaj
and Ravi Shankar was also sitting there you

593
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,710
see, hiding his face on the sides.

594
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:02,440
So when he had played his pakhawaj, My father
said: “Why don’t you also play some sitar

595
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:08,290
to me, I would like to see how much you have
learned."

596
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,560
He said: “No, no, sir, not today, not today."

597
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,240
So then he went inside, for something – the
guru.

598
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,060
He [Ravi] said: “See, are you going to see
here something?”

599
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,630
He [father] said: “What?”

600
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:24,530
“Big lump, you see, was here”, he said:
“He has broken my sitar on my head today

601
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:30,810
because I played two notes wrongly.

602
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:33,589
See sir."

603
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:34,980
[Laughter]

604
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,420
That was the thing.

605
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:43,450
The gurus are very, very, strict people, they
have to be.

606
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:48,510
And the way they used to treat the disciples.

607
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:50,680
It’s not like this.

608
00:48:50,680 --> 00:49:05,290
The gurus you know are the gurus who are trying
to pamper your ego.

609
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:06,290
Why?

610
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:09,589
Because they want your purse.

611
00:49:09,589 --> 00:49:13,890
They don’t want to enlighten you.

612
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:18,910
They say, “All right, what, you drink?

613
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:19,910
All right, doesn’t matter.

614
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:21,380
I can give you more.

615
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,190
Whatever you want I’ll give you.

616
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:27,630
Just pass the purse this side, that’s all.

617
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:40,170
Why do you want to have these, metal, this…
some metal-like, metallic things like a, say

618
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:42,310
a Rolls Royce?

619
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:45,320
What’s the use, this metal thing?

620
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,510
You pass it over to me.

621
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:49,510
I’ll look after it.

622
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,420
What is the need for you to have possessed
this grand palace?

623
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,080
Pass it over to me.

624
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:02,600
I’ll look after – you must give up everything
for me.

625
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,300
I’ll enlighten you."

626
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:09,160
Even if you may have palaces and anything,
the real guru will not look at your face.

627
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,710
He never hankers after people, never.

628
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:14,140
That’s the sign of a real guru: that he
doesn’t hanker after you: “Come along

629
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,040
to me, come along to me.

630
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,250
All right, how many people are coming?

631
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,330
Now have an organization and run a big mission
about it."

632
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:27,130
And then the people are coming and write your
names and you become the members of the society

633
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,770
and all that.

634
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:34,680
A real guru will sit in some odd place, where
you have to go seven miles up, walking, falling,

635
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,530
somewhere hidden, and there you go and you
find he’s not there.

636
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:37,530
[Laughter]You break your legs on the way.

637
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,190
[Shri Mataji laughs, laughter]

638
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:41,300
But they know so many things.

639
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:45,950
According to them, you are not to be treated
that kindly.

640
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:50,040
And they tell Me that “Mother, what is Your
whim?”.

641
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,950
And “We can’t understand.

642
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:56,339
For us, we had to work so hard to get these
vibrations."

643
00:50:56,339 --> 00:51:02,359
One gentleman has told that: “I was a frog.

644
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:05,710
Since then I’ve been seeking.

645
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:11,350
And I’ve spent how many years I don’t
know, so many thousand years to get vibrations,

646
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:16,480
while Mother has just given you like this!

647
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,890
What is your speciality?

648
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,580
Are you going to give your life for Mother?”

649
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,260
And all sort of questions.

650
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,260
[She laughs]

651
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,960
So I asked him: “Why did you tell them?

652
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,640
I don’t want their life.

653
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,660
What’s the use of their life?

654
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,839
I want their Spirit."

655
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,480
He said, “But why these?”

656
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,119
I said, “Are you jealous?”

657
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:41,119
[Laughter]

658
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,410
They say that “Mother, You carry on with
them.

659
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,110
We can’t face this, human beings are horrible."

660
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:59,820
And I’ve told you that I asked one person
to go to America, he ran away, within two

661
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,820
days.

662
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,820
Within two days.

663
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,720
He would not face Americans – the real ones.

664
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,440
The unreal ones are very nice, you see.

665
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,920
There’s mutual understanding going on.

666
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,600
So these hard taskmasters are so beautiful.

667
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,220
From outside they look so harsh.

668
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,070
Inside, they are so beautiful.

669
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:20,330
You must know how to please them.

670
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:24,710
For example, I went to see one guru once and
all the boys were against it.

671
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:30,560
He said, “Mother, we don’t believe in
any guru, why are you going to see?”

672
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:35,400
I said, “I don’t believe in any guru,
who told you?

673
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,630
I believe in all the gurus.

674
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,470
I don’t believe in the agurus."

675
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:41,800
I said, “You see the vibrations."

676
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,950
We had to climb up and this and that, and
we went down there.

677
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:49,030
And it was raining heavily, very heavily.

678
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:53,660
And the guru was very angry he was sitting
there, because he could control water, I told

679
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,660
you.

680
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,690
He could control rain, you know.

681
00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:01,160
So when I went up he was doing like this,
very angry.

682
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,390
He wouldn’t even look at Me.

683
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:08,290
I went and sat down, all drenched in water
with that rain.

684
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:25,070
He said, “Why did You not allow me to stop
the rain, is it because of my ego that You

685
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:27,180
wanted to punish me?

686
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:33,600
I didn’t want You to get drenched when You
are coming to see me."

687
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,690
What a great thing.

688
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:39,550
I mean he talked to Me as if he knew Me, you
see, the way he talked.

689
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:45,020
He said, “Not even my gurus and gurus never
had such an opportunity that You are coming

690
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:52,020
to see me, and I was just prepared here, and
here You are coming all drenched.

691
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:56,150
What a shame for me I could not control this
rain.

692
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:59,349
It’s all Your doing Mother, why did You
do it?”

693
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:03,920
I said, “Should I tell you why I did it?”

694
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,290
He said, “Why?”

695
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:12,650
I said, “You see, you have bought a sari
for Me, isn’t it?

696
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:20,890
And I would not take a sari from a sanyasi;
but if I get drenched, then I’ll have to

697
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:21,890
take."

698
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:22,890
[Laughter]

699
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:23,890
The whole thing melted away.

700
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:26,530
The whole thing, the whole temper, everything
melted away.

701
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:29,520
It was so sweet, you know, so sweet.

702
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:35,410
There was an artist with Me, who has done
the painting.

703
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:37,690
So beautiful, showing the love, you see.

704
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:38,690
He just fell at My Feet.

705
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:39,690
He said, “Mother, people have praised You.

706
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,800
What words should I use to praise You?”

707
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,020
I said, “Nothing.

708
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:49,220
Your sari, you bring it for Me.

709
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,350
First of all, I must wear your sari, I’m
all drenched."

710
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:53,350
So happy.

711
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:56,740
It’s so beautiful the whole thing.

712
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:00,940
This is what it is.

713
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,800
You all have to be the gurus.

714
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:08,310
I know, first thing you learn is to be very,
great hard taskmasters, to begin with.

715
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:10,900
That you should not do.

716
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,490
You have to be hard taskmaster with yourself.

717
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:18,750
And then, as your Mother, Who is your Guru,
is very sweet and tolerant, very kind, extremely

718
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:19,750
patient.

719
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,440
You have to deal with people like that.

720
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:30,510
Because we are not dealing with people who
are seekers of that quality, who will do anything

721
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:31,510
to get to God.

722
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:32,849
We are dealing with people who are confused,
absolutely confused.

723
00:55:32,849 --> 00:55:34,230
They are saints, but they are confused.

724
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,010
See, people come to our program, disappear.

725
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:39,901
They’ll get their Realization and disappear.

726
00:55:39,901 --> 00:55:40,901
Then you have to give them bandhans, this
thing.

727
00:55:40,901 --> 00:55:41,901
You see, they are still confused.

728
00:55:41,901 --> 00:55:44,690
And there are so many gurus who are acting,
there are so many things that are happening,

729
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:46,630
so we cannot be aggressive with them.

730
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:53,460
We have to be very patient, and we have to
think about our past, how we came to Mother,

731
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,860
how She had to convince us, how much we argued
with Her, what all we did.

732
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:05,040
So these people are coming, let us try to
be kind to them and talk to them, and tell

733
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,290
in a way which is congenial, which is beautiful.

734
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:15,750
Not like those gurus because they had only
one guru, and one disciple, do you know that?

735
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:20,720
The relationship was only one plus one.

736
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,970
And that one also used to come down, many-a-times.

737
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:29,109
Like one person I know, whom I met, he’s
told Me, “I have only one disciple and I’ve

738
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:30,109
given him up.

739
00:56:30,109 --> 00:56:31,520
He’s thrown in the sea, he’s useless."

740
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,520
I said, “What happened?”

741
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,190
He said, “I trained him up for twenty-five
years and he’s a good-for-nothing fellow.

742
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,110
Now he’s having a nice time, earning money.

743
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:41,070
He’s a Realized soul, just imagine.

744
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:45,030
And he’s having a nice time and he’s making
money out of it.

745
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:49,450
This is the last story I’ll tell you."

746
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:51,849
I said, “All right, where is he?”

747
00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:54,480
He told Me his name, this Maharaj.

748
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,030
I said, “All right, I’ll see him, don’t
you worry."

749
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:03,590
And when this fellow came in Bombay, one lady
telephoned to Me, “Mother, you wanted to

750
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:06,940
meet this Maharaji, he’s coming to my house."

751
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,910
I said, “All right, tell him I’m coming
to see him."

752
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:15,420
I went down to see him, he was smoking cigarettes
like this, sitting like this.

753
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:18,730
“Oh Mataji has come, very nice” and all
that.

754
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:22,490
He, of course, I mean he touched My feet like
this, “All right, sit down."

755
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:26,600
And there were ladies pressing his feet and
all that and he was talking to them very…

756
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:31,420
trying to show lot of arrogance in My presence.

757
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,640
I was just looking at him.

758
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,780
Then he said, “Oh.

759
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:40,970
So, my guru comes to see You in Bombay.

760
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:43,630
Why is he leaving his place?

761
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,849
Why should he do this?”.

762
00:57:45,849 --> 00:57:50,730
And all sorts of thing he was talking, against
his guru.

763
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:57,200
I said, “All right, now I’m going, but
I will put some sindoor on your head, just

764
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:02,330
to put a tilak on your head,” I said.

765
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:09,260
So I took some sindoor, put it on his head;
Agnya Chakra I moved it.

766
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,920
Then I said, “Now you put."

767
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,920
When he start put…

768
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,730
I sucked his hand, you see completely, and
he started, “Ahee-hee-hee-hee-hee he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he."

769
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:17,020
He said, “Mother, Mother what are You doing,
what are You doing?”

770
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,760
I said, “What am I doing?

771
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:24,760
Will you please take back all the words you
have said about your guru?

772
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,119
You have no shame.

773
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:31,740
Twenty-five years that man worked on you and
you’re bringing all the shame here.

774
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,670
Will you remove your hand?”

775
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:36,740
He said, “I can’t, I can’t, I can’t!

776
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,740
What are You doing to me?”

777
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:43,260
I said, “Unless and until you promise that
you will not say a word against your guru

778
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:49,000
and hold your ears, with the another hand,
or with your legs [She laughs], then only

779
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I’ll leave you."

780
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,890
(Laughter) He said, “I’m sorry, I’m
sorry, You will drop…?”

781
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:58,920
Now the others didn’t see all this conversation,
you see, they just saw his shaking, you see.

782
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,180
When I went away he said, “See, how powerful
I am?

783
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,180
See."

784
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,780
[Laughter] Fools as they were, they never
realized that he was shaking, and what shaking

785
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,780
means, you see?

786
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:11,910
And he made such a fool out of them.

787
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:21,650
He took from everyone, one and a quarter tola
[ed: tola is an old Indian weight equal to

788
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:24,570
180 grains, 0.375 troy ounces.]

789
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:32,940
gold, you see, as a dakshina, guru dakshina,
and said that “See, even Mataji – I was

790
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:38,630
getting all Her powers into me, sucking all
Her Powers into me."

791
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:44,910
[Laughter] And these fools believed him, you
see.

792
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:54,070
And then one of them met Me at the airport
and she told Me that “He’s taken away

793
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:55,320
so much money from us.

794
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:02,380
That day only he made us pay for one and a
quarter tola gold for the guru dakshina."

795
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:06,630
I said, “All right, I’ll see him one day,
again."

796
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:09,270
But all of them were doomed like that.

797
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:11,230
So, this is what it is.

798
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:13,760
And he’s so attractive to people, you know.

799
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:21,590
And then he was sitting on a very big thing
and the thousands are approaching him, there.

800
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:25,140
But then I did some arrangements.

801
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:32,380
Now he’s all right, in the jail, direct
[laughter].

802
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,870
In the jail, direct.

803
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:36,290
That’s what it is.

804
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:38,640
But we had one Sahaj Yogini like this.

805
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:50,670
She got her Realization and I told her, “Your
guru was no good and you don’t take anything

806
01:00:50,670 --> 01:01:11,020
from him, because he’ll try to give you
some siddhis and you will try to impress people."

807
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:27,030
She said, “No, no Mother, I want the parama,
I want the last, the absolute, I don’t want

808
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:28,210
all that."

809
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:38,280
Because her guru used to carry some snakes
around and do all kinds of tricks you see,

810
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,060
go into tantrums.

811
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:47,200
When I went to America, I heard about her,
that she’s having three thousand disciples;

812
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,940
I never had them in Bombay that time.

813
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:57,099
I used to hardly get about two hundred people
somehow or other sticking on to this… thing.

814
01:01:57,099 --> 01:01:59,950
I said, “Three thousand.

815
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:02,800
What is she doing?”

816
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:19,630
I got really worried you know; I put her into
bandhan and everything.

817
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:33,980
But when I came back, you won’t believe,
she had silver water carriers you see, these

818
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:40,400
pitchers, she brought to wash My Feet and
this.

819
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,690
I was so embarrassed, so embarrassed.

820
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:51,819
And she showed Me, “See Mother, what work
I’m doing."

821
01:02:51,819 --> 01:03:00,020
Such a big photograph of Mine there, put,
and all the bhoots around.

822
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:03,200
I could see all them hovering, you see, all
of them.

823
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,200
[Laughter]

824
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,200
I said, “What is she doing?

825
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:11,060
What work has she been doing and what is she
up to?

826
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:19,329
Because she’s completely gone darkened and
haunted."

827
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:24,320
I asked her, “What are you doing with these
people?”

828
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,060
“Oh Mother, you don’t know.

829
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:28,030
I’ve spread Your name there.

830
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:35,810
I can even tell people if they have lost their
property somewhere, wherever is the hidden

831
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:38,550
money, or I tell so many things….

832
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:43,810
I can even tell the name of the horse which
is going to come first."

833
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:45,430
[Laughter] I said, “Very nice.

834
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:49,650
What a nice Sahaj Yoga is going on here,”
you see?

835
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:54,920
So I told her, “All right, you come and
see Me tomorrow at home."

836
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,010
She came down.

837
01:03:56,010 --> 01:04:00,360
I had two-three people sitting, I said, “All
right, tell about them."

838
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,900
She said, “You live near a bridge."

839
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,870
He said, “No, never, I live near a sea.

840
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:08,100
How can you bridge a sea?”

841
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:09,960
Then she said this, that.

842
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,440
He said, “No, nothing."

843
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,300
Then she told another lady.

844
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,410
She said, “Nothing."

845
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:17,390
Third person said, “Nothing, this is not
true.

846
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:21,710
You are just telling something that is not
true."

847
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:26,050
So she rushed to Me, “Mother, have You taken
away all my powers?”

848
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:27,050
[Laughter]

849
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:30,960
I said, “If they were your powers I would
have made you sit here.

850
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,500
These are the powers of the devil.

851
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:37,620
What interest God has got to tell that ‘What
is the horse coming,’ and all that?

852
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,180
[Laughter] Why should you tell all these things?

853
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:44,460
These are not your powers, these are the powers
of the spirits which are haunting you, and

854
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:48,290
which you have captured, and your guru is
doing all this job."

855
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:50,050
“Oh God, I never knew."

856
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:51,800
I said, “It is that.

857
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,260
All right, say that ‘I give up.

858
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,310
I give up.’

859
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:56,360
Say it thrice."

860
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,820
She said, “All right, I’ll say, Mother.

861
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:01,620
I want the parama, I want the absolute”.

862
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:07,750
She went home, but you know this popularity,
this cheap popularity, is a very enticing

863
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:08,750
thing.

864
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:12,870
She again carried on, and now she is in the
lunatic asylum.

865
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,520
This is what it is.

866
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,580
Because these spirits which help you, come
back on you and torture you.

867
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:22,390
So all those people who try to deviate, even
after Realization, are corrected by the principle

868
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:23,910
of guru only.

869
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:27,430
With the principle of Agnya, you give Realization,
enlightenment.

870
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:32,090
With the principle of Sahasrara you give integration,
but with the principle of guru you give them

871
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:33,090
dharma.

872
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:42,329
That’s why so many people, all of you who
came to Me, have very easily given up all

873
01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:46,940
these habits, because you have found the Spirit,
the joy.

874
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:50,340
And then you don’t want all that.

875
01:05:50,340 --> 01:06:00,750
I don’t have to tell you that you have to
give up, you just give up, you just forget

876
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:05,220
it, because your attention is now attached
to your Spirit.

877
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:15,640
That is the job of a guru.

878
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:22,200
It is said that: “Guru is that which makes
you meet the Sahib."

879
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:26,630
Means: “makes you meet the Lord."

880
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:27,819
He’s the guru.

881
01:06:27,819 --> 01:06:29,260
Otherwise all these are not gurus.

882
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:32,830
But the one who has not even settled your
dharmas, who does not have his own dharmas,

883
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:36,650
how can you accept them as gurus?

884
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:38,520
May God bless you all.

885
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:40,069
[Start of 3: informal talk to seekers]

886
01:06:40,069 --> 01:06:43,220
Shri Mataji [about a young child]: This is
a born Realized child.

887
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,920
[Shri Mataji laughs]

888
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,180
Hello, how are you?

889
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:50,010
Hum, what are they catching?

890
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:51,590
He is showing from his feet.

891
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,100
All over right side Sahasrara.

892
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,600
Right side Sahasrara means what?

893
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,600
Superego.

894
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,480
It comes to the right [of the brain].

895
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:02,640
All feeling the heaviness on the right side,
the little child is showing.

896
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,640
They are working, they are busy all the time.

897
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,819
All the time they are busy.

898
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:16,260
Gavin’s child’s such a little thing…
all the time.

899
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:23,800
[Laughter, She laughs] Trying to clear you
out – great people they are.

900
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:29,940
All the time they are working.

901
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:37,800
That’s why I want you all to get married
soon, with so many great children are to be

902
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,800
born to you.

903
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,300
All right, I can make it cool for you, it’s
all right, don’t you worry.

904
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,300
[Laughter]

905
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:46,190
You have to think of the Moon who is your
maternal uncle.

906
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:47,190
He was born with Lakshmi.

907
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:49,190
There are fourteen things that were born from
the sea.

908
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,589
One of them is also a hunter.

909
01:07:52,589 --> 01:07:57,140
The stick Gregoire gave Me yesterday was also,
came out of the sea.

910
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,140
That was the fourteenth thing.

911
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,140
Better now?

912
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,774
Now, those who have come for the first time
should come forward, you see, it’s better

913
01:08:00,774 --> 01:08:01,774
in the forward line somewhere, would be better
and the second line could be – it’s all

914
01:08:01,774 --> 01:08:02,774
right.

915
01:08:02,774 --> 01:08:03,774
These people have come for the first time,
all of you?

916
01:08:03,774 --> 01:08:04,774
All right, can you come on these first three
lines, all right.

917
01:08:04,774 --> 01:08:05,774
Now who else is there?

918
01:08:05,774 --> 01:08:06,774
Please, come forward.

919
01:08:06,774 --> 01:08:11,440
As you know, Sahaja Yoga is a very subtle
thing and the main thing is it must work,

920
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:20,009
it must actualize, the Kundalini must rise.

921
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:31,179
You must get your Realization, that’s the
main concern is.

922
01:08:31,179 --> 01:08:38,150
Whatever you may say, whatever your arguments
may be or any problems may be, we are not

923
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:39,150
bothered about that.

924
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:43,080
What we are bothered about: that you should
meet yourself.

925
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:48,900
That’s the main point we are at, and that’s
what we have to achieve.

926
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:52,859
Now the problems arise out of our imbalances
in life and so many things.

927
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:55,349
Whatever it is, still, the force is so great,
that you will get your Realization.

928
01:08:55,349 --> 01:08:56,349
Why I’m telling you?

929
01:08:56,349 --> 01:09:03,569
That I find people, once they get their Realization,
they think it’s done now, we are happy,

930
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:05,079
then they don’t come.

931
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:06,319
It’s just the germination has taken place,
the Kundalini has shot off, because She’s

932
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:07,409
been waiting all these days, you see, so the
whole thing comes up as a big experience.

933
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:08,409
But that doesn’t mean that you have established
it.

934
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:10,869
So the second thing you have to do is to establish,
that’s very important.

935
01:09:10,869 --> 01:09:15,099
Much more important than getting Realization
I feel, because the Realization, if it takes

936
01:09:15,099 --> 01:09:18,979
place and it falls down, then what’s the
use?

937
01:09:18,979 --> 01:09:25,429
So you take your Realization, which you’ll
get, no doubt about it, because you all look

938
01:09:25,429 --> 01:09:26,429
that way.

939
01:09:26,429 --> 01:09:30,339
But, then you must have self-esteem and understand
that you have got it because you deserved

940
01:09:30,339 --> 01:09:31,339
it.

941
01:09:31,339 --> 01:09:34,799
Some people haven’t got it in India who
have been with Me for seven years, but you’ll

942
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:35,799
get it I’m sure.

943
01:09:35,799 --> 01:09:36,819
That I can see clearly, you are all going
to get it.

944
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:40,369
But that doesn’t mean if you get it, that
you again waste it, because this is what you

945
01:09:40,369 --> 01:09:41,369
have been seeking all your lives.

946
01:09:41,369 --> 01:09:47,139
Because in the West the problem is: though
such saints are born, they have this rambling

947
01:09:47,139 --> 01:09:48,259
of the brain and they start thinking.

948
01:09:48,259 --> 01:09:49,259
You do not get it through your rationality.

949
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:50,259
You get it through your Kundalini, which you
cannot think about.

950
01:09:50,259 --> 01:09:52,259
So you allow it to grow, manifest itself,
and you become as good as others are.

951
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:55,177
Now they are all experts and gurus, you know,
they know such a lot about Kundalini.

952
01:09:55,177 --> 01:09:58,120
You’ll be amazed, they are all experts,
they look just like you!

953
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,120
They are raising Kundalini, they are giving
Realization, they know everything about it.

954
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,120
So in the same way, you have to be.

955
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,120
It’s a very simple thing which takes place
at any age, any time, any race, anything.

956
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,120
The main thing is that you must have self-esteem,
you must know that you are saints.

957
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,120
You have been saints for years and you have
been ages like this.

958
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,120
You have been seeking and seeking and seeking.

959
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,120
Now when you have found it, you allow it to
grow, because it’s very important, and you

960
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,120
must know your value.

961
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,120
That is important.

962
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,120
Because I value you, because I see something
much deeper that you can’t see.

963
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,120
But you don’t see that, gradually you’ll
start seeing, all right?

964
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,120
On this promise, I’ll give you Realization.

965
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,120
Put your hands like this.

966
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,120
Put both the feet on the ground, straight.

967
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,120
Sometimes I find, you see I’ve worked very
hard on people and they get lost, I feel very

968
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,120
sorry for that.

969
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,120
Left Swadishthana, you see [She laughs] – give
him…

970
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,120
Like a saint he’s sitting here, great guru.

971
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,120
[About a child]

972
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,120
Now put your hands towards Me, like this,
and close your eyes.

973
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,120
Please close your eyes.

974
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,120
Now what happens is that first you become
thoughtlessly aware, nirvichar samadhi.

975
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,120
Samadhi means enlightened awareness.

976
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,120
You get enlightened awareness which is thoughtless.

977
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,120
You become thoughtlessly aware.

978
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,120
First.

979
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,120
And in the second happening, when it crosses
the Agnya it happens to you, and when it crosses,

980
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,120
pierces through this point called as taloo,
the fontanel bone area, you start feeling

981
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,120
the radiation of your Spirit in your hands,
like vibrations.

982
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,120
Are you feeling the cool breeze in your hands?

983
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,120
Already you’ve got it!

984
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,120
You haven’t.

985
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,120
There’s a little problem.

986
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,120
All right, watch Me here, little bit.

987
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,120
There?

988
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,120
Hm.

989
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,120
Without thinking, just watch Me, it will work
out.

990
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,120
Whatever I’ve said, you forget it.

991
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,120
You see, if you have taken drugs doesn’t
matter, don’t worry.

992
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,120
I can drink all that; just suck it out.

993
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,120
Don’t you worry about all these things,
forget, have no guilt of any kind, for heaven’s

994
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,120
sake.

995
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,120
I’m talking of Ocean of Love which is ocean.

996
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,120
What guilt can you have?

997
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,120
Just a speck.

998
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,120
So please, do not have any guilt, on the contrary
say to Me that “Mother, we are not guilty

999
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,120
– I’m not guilty."

1000
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,120
In your heart, just say that.

1001
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,120
That’s the only catching point in you.

1002
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,120
It’s a fashion also, these days, to feel
guilty about anything.

1003
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,120
Now close your eyes.

1004
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,120
Please close your eyes.

1005
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,120
Know that you are not guilty at all, that
you are very beautiful.

1006
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,120
Right to the left.

1007
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,120
Move right to the – keep your eyes….

1008
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,120
are you feeling?

1009
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,120
It will work out.

1010
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,120
Just let it be, let it be, you see, let it
go, let it go.

1011
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,120
Close your eyes.

1012
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,120
You must get it.

1013
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,120
Not to get upset with yourself.

1014
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,120
Are you criticizing yourself?

1015
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,120
Are you?

1016
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,120
Seeker: Just frightened.

1017
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,120
Shri Mataji: Eh?

1018
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,120
Seeker: Just frightened.

1019
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,120
Yogis: Frightened.

1020
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,120
Shri Mataji: Frightened, about what?

1021
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,120
About the beauty that you have?

1022
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,120
Not to be frightened at all.

1023
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,120
Nothing to be frightened.

1024
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,120
Do I look frightful?

1025
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,120
Seeker: Nothing.

1026
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,120
Shri Mataji: Ha?

1027
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,120
Seeker: Nothing.

1028
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,120
Shri Mataji: All right.

1029
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,120
Now close, close your eyes.

1030
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,120
No, there’s nothing to be frightened, it’s
the easiest thing that can happen, absolutely

1031
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,120
it is there, it’s like the germination of
a seed.

1032
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,120
Just close your eyes, nothing to be frightened.

1033
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,120
Just let it go, let it go, that’s all.

1034
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,120
Is the simplest thing.

1035
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,120
She’s got it.

1036
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,120
Just like that.

1037
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,120
You have to be frightened of pubs and things
like that, you know.

1038
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,120
I’m really frightened of pubs.

1039
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,120
Right to the left.

1040
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,120
Move (?) left to the right.

1041
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,120
Let’s feel his vibrations, come along.

1042
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,120
Some of you come along.

1043
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,120
No, at the back.

1044
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,120
Just sit down, sit down.

1045
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,120
They’ll just work it out.

1046
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,120
Close your eyes, close your eyes, they are
just helping you out, just close your eyes.

1047
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,120
Just – you see, it is like, they know the
swimming and they are just trying to help

1048
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,120
you.

1049
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,120
Once you are on the shore, they’ll also
teach you how to swim and then you are going

1050
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,120
to save others.

1051
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,120
Hm.

1052
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,120
Work on him.

1053
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,120
Close your eyes, don’t think about it.

1054
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,120
Just enjoy, this is the greatest thing you’ve
got it.

1055
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,120
Sahasrara, right.

1056
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,120
No, no, it’ll work out, don’t you worry,
we know your problem.

1057
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:43,120
Just don’t – close your eyes.

1058
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,120
We know your problem.

1059
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,120
Right to the left.

1060
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,120
We know your problem, we know everything where
that’s happening.

1061
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,120
Just close your eyes.

1062
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,120
There’s nothing to be frightened, I mean,
what’s going to happen?

1063
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,120
Somebody is frightening you inside.

1064
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,120
That’s what it is, I must say.

1065
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,120
There’s nothing to be frightened.

1066
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,120
Sakshat Moksha Dayini, Aham sakshat Moksha
Dayini Aham sakshat Moksha Dayini.

1067
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,120
Sakshat Moksha Dayini Aham sakshat Moksha
Dayini Aham sakshat Moksha Dayini Aham sakshat

1068
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,120

1069
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,120

01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,120
Aham sakshat Moksha Dayini Aham sakshat Moksha
Dayini Aham sakshat Moksha Dayini Aham sakshat

1071
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,120
Moksha Dayini.

1072
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,120
With hand.

1073
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,120
The…

1074
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,120
Marcus, just stand up and pull it out.

1075
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,120
It’s working on him.

1076
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,120
It’s all right, they are working it out.

1077
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,120
It’s started, now don’t…

1078
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,120
It’s started, already has started now.

1079
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,120
Close your eyes.

1080
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,120
It’s working out.

1081
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,120
Don’t you worry.

1082
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,120
It’s working out.

1083
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:08,620
She’s got it very well.
