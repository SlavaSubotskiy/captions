00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,077
Guru Puja Cabella Ligure (Italy), 23 July 2000.

2
00:00:02,198 --> 00:00:08,944
Today we are here to know about guru principle.

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,500
What does a guru do.

4
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:33,642
Whatever you have,

5
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,096
all the precious things within you,

6
00:00:39,627 --> 00:00:47,880
he discovers them for your knowledge.

7
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,679
Actually it is all there -

8
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:59,044
everything.

9
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:05,520
All the knowledge, all the spirituality,

10
00:01:05,783 --> 00:01:10,416
all the joy, is there.

11
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:13,557
Right time!

12
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,640
It's all contained within you.

13
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:36,230
Only thing the Guru does

14
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,924
makes you knowledgeable about your knowledge,

15
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,273
about your own spirit.

16
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:56,913
Everyone has the Spirit within himself.

17
00:01:58,376 --> 00:02:04,058
Everyone has the spirituality within himself.

18
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:10,422
There is nothing that you get from outside.

19
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:15,876
But before getting this knowledge, you are dealing,

20
00:02:16,077 --> 00:02:22,033
 or you are living in ignorance.

21
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:27,764
In that ignorance you do not know

22
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:33,734
what treasure you have got within yourself.

23
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:41,059
So the guru's job is to make you know what you are.

24
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:53,488
That is the first step.

25
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:56,575
That it starts,

26
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:00,329
that awakening within you

27
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:04,757
by which you know

28
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:08,693
that you are not this outside world,

29
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:11,839
this is all an illusion.

30
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:19,583
And you start getting enlightened within yourself.

31
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:27,197
Some people get full light and some people get it gradually.

32
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:33,819
Essence of all the religions is that you should know yourself.

33
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:39,443
Those people who are fighting in the name of religion,

34
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:43,765
you have to go and ask them,

35
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:47,714
you have to enquire from them,

36
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,718
"Did your religion make you know yourself?"

37
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:56,902
If all the religions have said one thing -

38
00:03:57,233 --> 00:04:03,168
you have to do all these things just to know yourself.

39
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:09,516
But people get into rituals.

40
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:15,696
They think by doing all these rituals they are near God.

41
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:22,683
They live in ignorance absolutely about themselves, and

42
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:27,841
day in and day out they work out something,

43
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:31,945
which is nothing to do with yourself'.

44
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:37,288
Lots of acrobats, prayers,

45
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:41,472
pujas, these things go on.

46
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:45,207
Because it is all ignorance.

47
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:48,276
People go on paying them money

48
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:51,985
and they become very rich

49
00:04:52,186 --> 00:04:56,741
and their interest is only money.

50
00:04:58,154 --> 00:05:03,197
They want to take all your money, absolutely,

51
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:06,610
and make a fool out of you.

52
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:11,088
They pamper your ego.

53
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,556
With pampering of that ego you just start drifting

54
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:21,499
into the ocean of illusion

55
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:27,476
and you are drowned into that illusion,

56
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:29,824
thinking that you are very religious

57
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:35,197
and you are just in connection with God, which you are not.

58
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:40,669
To know God you should know your Self first.

59
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:45,637
Without knowing that, you cannot know God.

60
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:51,848
That's essential, that you should know your Self.

61
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:58,578
But when you know yourself, you know partly.

62
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:03,056
The experience is not sufficient.

63
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:07,056
The knowledge has to come.

64
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:13,274
And the guru gives the knowledge about your Self.

65
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:18,274
Now you have to tally it.

66
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:22,578
You should find out whatever your guru has told you.

67
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:27,684
Is it true or not? Is it correct or not?

68
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:32,548
Or is it just another illusion?

69
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:40,314
Now in this ascent people get into lots of problems.

70
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:45,969
First and foremost is the ego problem, especially in the west.

71
00:06:46,295 --> 00:06:50,652
Ego stands up and you start thinking you are great,

72
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:52,723
you are better than others,

73
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:56,930
and there is something special about you.

74
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:02,057
This ignorance is more dangerous

75
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:05,501
than the worldly ignorance, I think,

76
00:07:05,723 --> 00:07:11,675
because in the worldly ignorance, you do feel the

77
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:19,876
consequences of wrong things.

78
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:23,881
But when you are half way,

79
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:29,932
when your ignorance is that about yourself,

80
00:07:30,195 --> 00:07:34,148
when you are going to a higher realm,

81
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:40,399
then one should always understand that you cannot have ego.

82
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,929
Then what starts is introspection.

83
00:07:56,001 --> 00:08:00,832
You start looking at yourself,

84
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:04,666
what's wrong with you.

85
00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:07,958
When you understand that you have ego,

86
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:11,047
you start looking at yourself.

87
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:17,253
Or when you find there is something missing

88
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:20,727
or something wrong,

89
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:24,688
then also, you start introspecting.

90
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:31,797
This should be a very, very honest, very honest effort.

91
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:36,819
Some people in Sahaja Yoga, at a very early stage

92
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,009
start thinking they that they are very great

93
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,647
and they don't need any introspection.

94
00:08:43,848 --> 00:08:49,790
And they rise again into the clouds of ignorance

95
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:56,551
without achieving Selfhood or I can call it Self realisation.

96
00:08:58,257 --> 00:09:03,269
So you have to introspect and see for yourself

97
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,159
what have you been doing, what are you,

98
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,423
how far you have come.

99
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:14,444
How much --

100
00:09:14,645 --> 00:09:18,775
please don't translate just now all right? You can do it later on.

101
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:25,287
You must hear with full concentration.

102
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:30,700
Even if you don't understand it will work.

103
00:09:31,065 --> 00:09:36,565
Now the style of such a person changes gradually. How?

104
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:41,292
First of all a person who is extremely aggressive,

105
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:47,340
hot-tempered and full of ego

106
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:52,530
starts becoming very gentle and mild.

107
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:59,031
Another type, which is frightened and afraid

108
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:05,285
and very cautious, starts becoming fearless.

109
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:11,793
At that stage you have no fears.

110
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:16,415
You are sure that you are on the right path

111
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:20,705
and you are moving on the right lines.

112
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:26,559
You are not easily disturbed there.

113
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:32,067
But still you have to rise higher and higher,

114
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:36,584
where, when you meditate, you understand,

115
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:41,901
that there is something wrong within yourself.

116
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,537
You have achieved your Self realisation.

117
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:49,092
You have got the blessings of Self realisation.

118
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:52,076
Your health is good,

119
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:57,682
you have got all kinds of blessings which you cannot count.

120
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:01,573
All that is there but...

121
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,462
still you have to go further.

122
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:12,841
And that is to understand

123
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:19,095
all the knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

124
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:28,187
You have to understand through your mental capacity,

125
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:32,980
first, to begin with, and then you have to verify

126
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,431
how far it is correct.

127
00:11:37,658 --> 00:11:40,770
How far you have understood it,

128
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,919
how far you have worked on it,

129
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,306
how far you know.

130
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:57,984
And when you start seeing yourself,

131
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:01,661
you start

132
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:07,669
entering into the realm of Bhakti.

133
00:12:08,182 --> 00:12:13,079
You become a mild person, become a sweet person,

134
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:18,388
you don't talk too much, you don't harass anyone.

135
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:23,831
You are a very pleasant person, very gentle,

136
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:28,220
very understanding.

137
00:12:30,561 --> 00:12:35,715
This person has to verify

138
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,808
how he is behaving towards others.

139
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:49,072
Now the attention starts moving from oneself to another

140
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:53,365
and you start seeing how you behave.

141
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:58,373
How you love.

142
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:04,110
What is the quality of your compassion?

143
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:11,244
When you love somebody

144
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:17,085
without any expectations, just love, then

145
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:23,432
you are absolutely dedicated to that person, absolutely.

146
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:27,521
you just obey.

147
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:31,610
You will do anything for that person.

148
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:37,660
If there is this love which you call as surrender.

149
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:42,826
This is just the love.

150
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:45,969
Surrender is nothing but the love,

151
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:52,032
and that love, which is extremely joy-giving,

152
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,230
this bhakti starts, this dedication starts,

153
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:05,254
and you are cleansed by that bhakti.

154
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:12,069
All the bad qualities you have,

155
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:18,231
you can call them, all the deficiencies you have,

156
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,128
all the problems you have,

157
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:29,177
you understand and you get over it.

158
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:34,875
Now if you see somebody with the same qualities,

159
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:39,422
with the same troubles,

160
00:14:39,676 --> 00:14:45,009
you in the love of that person

161
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,660
you try to tolerate.

162
00:14:49,113 --> 00:14:52,748
Such a person just tolerates.

163
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:06,683
There is no aggression,

164
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:12,271
and these people forgive.

165
00:15:12,906 --> 00:15:14,744
Realised Souls go on forgiving,

166
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:18,540
their capacity to forgive is tremendous.

167
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:25,015
They do not bear any malice against anyone.

168
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,015
They don't have any anger about anyone.

169
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:35,145
They just go on tolerating and forgiving and forgiving.

170
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:40,026
This forgiveness is just

171
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:46,211
a music, I should say, of your bhakti.

172
00:15:46,983 --> 00:15:50,062
The amount of forgiveness

173
00:15:50,268 --> 00:15:55,157
these masters could have, can be seen from the life of Christ.

174
00:15:56,244 --> 00:16:01,080
They are tortured, crucified - most of the saints were tortured.

175
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:03,588
People never liked them.

176
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:09,746
And they were crucified, but as you know

177
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:14,810
that they never resented,

178
00:16:15,112 --> 00:16:18,008
they never take a revenge,

179
00:16:18,214 --> 00:16:24,163
they never did anything which was not compassionate.

180
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:30,431
They had compassion and compassion for such people,

181
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:36,622
they felt that 'Oh God, please forgive them.

182
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:42,962
What they are doing they don't know'.

183
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:45,761
Extremely compassionate.

184
00:16:45,983 --> 00:16:49,965
And they are that, that becomes their nature.

185
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:54,055
When it becomes their nature,

186
00:16:54,270 --> 00:17:00,917
they become people with complete peace.

187
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,969
They are not disturbed.

188
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:09,899
They are never disturbed with whatever is happening

189
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:14,303
and they think it's God's will.

190
00:17:14,605 --> 00:17:17,400
Because nothing can disturb them,

191
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:20,898
nothing can upset them.

192
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:28,545
They just enjoy their devotion.

193
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:35,305
Devotion to their guru maybe.

194
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:39,202
Devotion to God.

195
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:45,805
In that devotion they may write

196
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:51,378
beautiful poetry, they may go on dancing,

197
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:56,330
they may go on singing, because the peace is within

198
00:17:56,561 --> 00:18:01,509
and they are enjoying themselves.

199
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:09,544
When they are alone, they are never alone,

200
00:18:09,814 --> 00:18:12,787
they enjoy themselves.

201
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:16,726
They know that -

202
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:22,085
"We are one with the Divine"

203
00:18:22,363 --> 00:18:26,140
- and the blessing of the Divine they enjoy.

204
00:18:27,185 --> 00:18:30,828
Another thing is they never take to artificiality.

205
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,685
They are never worried, never upset,

206
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:43,078
they are neither futuristic nor think of the past,

207
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,772
but they are in the present.

208
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:55,595
When they are in the present, they are absolutely silent.

209
00:18:55,921 --> 00:19:01,889
If there is any problem, or anything happens to them,

210
00:19:02,492 --> 00:19:08,177
they immediately go into thoughtless awareness.

211
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:12,645
That is what their capacity is.

212
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:18,756
To become a guru you have to develop that personality.

213
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,031
Not to be bound by anything.

214
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:26,007
Now I'll tell you my own example.

215
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:31,167
I never hurry, I'm never bothered about time.

216
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:35,864
Once I was going to America -

217
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:40,134
because if you are sure the Divine has plans for you,

218
00:19:40,436 --> 00:19:42,298
you are not bothered,

219
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:45,999
the Divine is looking after you, so why to bother --

220
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:49,443
I was going to America and one child fell down.

221
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:52,849
I was just about to get up and go -

222
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:56,929
and broke her arm.

223
00:19:57,421 --> 00:20:02,727
And when I saw the child I said "All right, I'll put that child right".

224
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:07,742
But, they said, "You are going to America!" 
I said, "I'll go in any case!

225
00:20:08,035 --> 00:20:11,717
"So I cured the child, it took about half an hour,

226
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:15,400
and then I came out "All right, let's go to the airport".

227
00:20:15,654 --> 00:20:20,519
They said, "Mother you are very late". I said, "I'm never late.

228
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:22,675
Let's go!".

229
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:26,360
We went there to the airport,

230
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:30,487
and the plane by which I was going was out of order,

231
00:20:30,757 --> 00:20:33,802
so there was another plane going to Washington not to New York,

232
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:37,894
and I wanted to go to Washington only!

233
00:20:38,648 --> 00:20:42,378
So just imagine how things work out,

234
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:49,052
and we call them 'Sahaja'. It has worked out 'Sahaja'.

235
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:02,372
That means it's effortless.

236
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:08,705
But first of all your personality should be such

237
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:16,200
that your devotion

238
00:21:16,597 --> 00:21:18,800
is so great

239
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:24,971
that Divine is compelled to look after you...

240
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,645
compelled to look after you!

241
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:39,632
You have to understand that Divine force is around you,

242
00:21:41,481 --> 00:21:45,252
and this Divine force is

243
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:50,696
absolute guarantee for your safety.

244
00:21:50,982 --> 00:21:55,196
For everything that you want to do.

245
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:01,878
You can say that "Mother you are very powerful".

246
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,402
You can become also very powerful!

247
00:22:05,603 --> 00:22:11,555
If you get completely dedicated to the Divine work,

248
00:22:11,904 --> 00:22:14,956
you will also have all the powers

249
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:21,077
and the Divine will provide all the necessary work

250
00:22:22,117 --> 00:22:26,875
that you want to do, necessary time you have to have.

251
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:32,065
Everything is provided by the Divine.

252
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:36,002
But the compassion,

253
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:41,010
when it extends from other people to God,

254
00:22:41,265 --> 00:22:46,806
or to Divine person or to your guru,

255
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:53,387
then it becomes very easy to live,

256
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:59,126
very simple to live, no complications,

257
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:01,713
everything is sorted out,

258
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:06,214
and you are not bothered about anything.

259
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:11,975
You just close your eyes and things work out.

260
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:19,057
Everything works out as if that's your will,

261
00:23:19,258 --> 00:23:24,361
but you don't have to will it, don't have to think about it,

262
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:28,937
it just works out, but Divine looks after everything.

263
00:23:29,138 --> 00:23:31,241
It looks after your comfort,

264
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:37,407
looks after your health, everything.

265
00:23:37,963 --> 00:23:42,750
And this Divine help,

266
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:47,790
you do not seek, you do not ask for,

267
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:50,785
but you are a personality

268
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:55,737
for which the Divine is responsible.

269
00:23:55,959 --> 00:24:01,518
You are a special responsibility of the Divine.

270
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:06,804
And it knows what is good for you and what is not.

271
00:24:07,534 --> 00:24:12,559
It's an example, I can give many where I,

272
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:17,717
supposing, I thought somebody is coming to meet me,

273
00:24:18,035 --> 00:24:24,008
and people told me "Mother, he's very negative", He will never come,

274
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:26,230
he'll never come.

275
00:24:26,444 --> 00:24:31,782
All positive things will happen, and if a negative things take place,

276
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,635
then you will use your compassion.

277
00:24:35,835 --> 00:24:38,762
If it is negative you'll use your compassion

278
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:41,468
and you'll solve the problem.

279
00:24:41,777 --> 00:24:45,886
You can solve the problems of your own,

280
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:50,506
of your surroundings, of your community.

281
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,562
So now you have got your Self realisation.

282
00:24:55,824 --> 00:24:59,574
How far you have gone in that I don't know.

283
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:04,058
I have a complaint about women, so many ladies,

284
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:07,584
that they don't meditate.

285
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:11,743
That they are not looking after themselves,

286
00:25:11,973 --> 00:25:14,105
they are not realised souls,

287
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:17,965
and that's why many men want to divorce them

288
00:25:18,203 --> 00:25:23,875
because they think these women are good for nothing,

289
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:30,034
and some men also are like that.

290
00:25:31,082 --> 00:25:36,988
To solve this problem you have to have compassion,

291
00:25:37,512 --> 00:25:40,850
and you have to, somehow or other, with compassion

292
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:47,027
you should win over the partner of your life.

293
00:25:48,455 --> 00:25:53,057
After all men are much more busy than women are.

294
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:58,712
But women indulge into so many other things.

295
00:25:58,954 --> 00:26:04,923
They have to look after their family, their children, their everything.

296
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:11,510
And their mind is involved into all such mundane things

297
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:15,275
that they have no time to meditate.

298
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:18,419
Without meditation you cannot rise.

299
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,345
You have to meditate.

300
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:25,561
People think that: "Now we have got realisation, so it's all right". No!

301
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:28,309
Every day you must meditate

302
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,573
because that's the cleansing that takes place.

303
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:37,238
With the cleansing you understand.

304
00:26:37,643 --> 00:26:42,960
You understand what is needed

305
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:46,918
and what is not needed, you are cleansed out.

306
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,819
That is done by Divine.

307
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,988
But you must religiously meditate.

308
00:27:00,878 --> 00:27:06,308
Gradually you will find your meditation will become very deep.

309
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,283
You will become very, very deep

310
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:14,648
and your powers will start showing.

311
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:25,517
When you are anywhere, negativity will run away.

312
00:27:25,954 --> 00:27:30,943
All sorts of problems can be solved.

313
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:36,544
Whatever you want to do is available to you.

314
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:42,381
Whatever is your desire to help others

315
00:27:42,618 --> 00:27:46,514
or give to someone, you just get it.

316
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:50,777
Is my own experience I'm telling you.

317
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:56,433
You have to meditate at least 10 minutes

318
00:27:56,634 --> 00:28:01,026
every evening and morning about 5 minutes.

319
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:07,343
With complete devotion, with complete admiration.

320
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:13,601
I have seen some people here, such bhakti, such devotion,

321
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:18,957
which is shraddha - is higher than bhakti -

322
00:28:19,195 --> 00:28:24,004
that it becomes part and parcel of your being.

323
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:29,592
It just envelops you completely.

324
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:34,944
When you have that shraddha, it is very miraculous.

325
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:38,610
It works so many miracles.

326
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,395
It's true some people were cured

327
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:46,246
only thinking of me, is a fact.

328
00:28:46,664 --> 00:28:51,545
But that doesn't mean that they had the shraddha of that level,

329
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:56,156
but that means that they have to develop shraddha.

330
00:28:56,394 --> 00:28:58,534
Now how to develop a shraddha,

331
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:03,711
is a natural light of the Spirit.

332
00:29:05,707 --> 00:29:10,929
Because people are trying very hard

333
00:29:12,135 --> 00:29:15,190
to develop shraddha,

334
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:20,850
but shraddha cannot be developed by mental activity,

335
00:29:21,175 --> 00:29:26,413
by any activity, but meditation of silence.

336
00:29:26,738 --> 00:29:32,414
If you do the meditation - I have always told you to do meditation.

337
00:29:32,615 --> 00:29:34,654
I immediately know a person

338
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:38,551
who has been meditating and who has not been.

339
00:29:38,765 --> 00:29:41,312
They'll come to my puja, all right,

340
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:45,447
and they'll talk about Sahaja Yoga,

341
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:50,256
they'll go out and do it for popularity.

342
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,349
Many people are like that.

343
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:56,775
They go out and for popularity they work it out.

344
00:29:56,989 --> 00:30:02,974
But inside they have not yet traced their own Self.

345
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:10,258
So at this development stage you should be encouraged,

346
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:16,584
and should be understood that you can reach that state very easily

347
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:22,154
through meditation and introspection.

348
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:28,436
With introspection you will develop a new quality of understanding

349
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:34,790
that you will find solutions to things.

350
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:41,703
That is another quality a person who is a realised soul has.

351
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:47,901
It can find solutions to all your problems.

352
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:54,446
It can, he can suggest what is the way

353
00:30:54,647 --> 00:30:58,877
you can be helped.

354
00:31:00,202 --> 00:31:05,968
Then a kind of a brotherhood out of the shraddha develops.

355
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:08,341
You may be giving big lectures on Sahaja Yoga,

356
00:31:08,556 --> 00:31:10,824
you may be doing all kinds of things,

357
00:31:11,024 --> 00:31:16,214
but unless and until you have shraddha,

358
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:18,881
you cannot rise.

359
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,458
And this shraddha is a kind of a love within you,

360
00:31:23,696 --> 00:31:29,648
I should say, which spreads like gentle fire

361
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:35,688
which doesn't burn, which doesn't give heat,

362
00:31:35,934 --> 00:31:41,847
but cold, beautiful breeze-like feeling within,

363
00:31:42,823 --> 00:31:46,980
which makes you understand.

364
00:31:47,258 --> 00:31:52,638
You will never talk ill about a sahaja yogi, never.

365
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:58,428
I never listen to anybody who tells me something against sahaja yogi.

366
00:31:58,713 --> 00:32:04,642
Up to a point, when it is a collective complaint,

367
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,601
then I am little bit bothered and I talk about it to the leader.

368
00:32:09,863 --> 00:32:14,189
But otherwise if one person comes and tells me this and this,

369
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:20,366
I just tell that person, "You introspect yourself, it's not so".

370
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:23,806
Finding faults with others

371
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:33,286
is a common game all human beings play.

372
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:35,839
They never see their own faults.

373
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,855
What's the use of finding faults of others?

374
00:32:40,056 --> 00:32:45,645
By finding faults with others you're not going to be helped.

375
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:50,213
Try to find faults within you, which you can cure,

376
00:32:50,414 --> 00:32:56,281
which you can help, which you can work it out.

377
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:02,652
It's a responsibility you have, you must know to yourself

378
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:06,397
that you better find out your defects

379
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:10,183
and get them corrected.

380
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:16,148
But some people are very proud of their fondness --

381
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:20,484
they talk like this, "I like this, I like that".

382
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:23,807
What about the Spirit?

383
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:28,965
You like this, you like that, then what about your Spirit?

384
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:30,988
Does it like?

385
00:33:31,189 --> 00:33:36,339
Does it enjoy?

386
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,170
They'll go on saying, "I like this, I don't like this,

387
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:43,456
I don't like that!" It's very common in the West.

388
00:33:43,657 --> 00:33:48,181
Now see, some ladies have made this beautiful carpets for me.

389
00:33:48,412 --> 00:33:54,396
They are so thick that when I walk on them I little bit lose balance,

390
00:33:54,721 --> 00:33:58,103
but the love with which they are made,

391
00:33:58,397 --> 00:34:04,095
makes me so joyous, so happy,

392
00:34:04,421 --> 00:34:09,797
that you can't imagine, what I feel about them.

393
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:15,210
This joy, this ocean of joy, is within you.

394
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:19,711
And when it starts stirring up,

395
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:25,879
it doesn't torment you, it gives you beautiful --

396
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:29,798
I don't know how to use words to express that --

397
00:34:29,998 --> 00:34:34,902
it's like a drizzle on your being,

398
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:39,066
it's like a grace on your being.

399
00:34:39,267 --> 00:34:44,513
The love of other people enthrals you.

400
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:51,410
You don't ask for it, but if you see a person

401
00:34:51,696 --> 00:34:54,902
who is very loving and kind,

402
00:34:55,172 --> 00:35:00,592
there is real friendship in that kind of relationship.

403
00:35:00,894 --> 00:35:06,358
But talking ill about sahaja yogis, it's very wrong.

404
00:35:06,558 --> 00:35:11,809
And then talking to everyone that, "This is wrong with this person,

405
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:17,954
he had done this, he had done that", is very, very wrong

406
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:22,329
and creating a collective feeling against the person --

407
00:35:22,535 --> 00:35:26,358
instead of helping that person.

408
00:35:26,628 --> 00:35:29,522
Always people are in trouble.

409
00:35:29,723 --> 00:35:33,030
Then collectively you must help that person.

410
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:37,191
Not talk ill of that person. May be some mistakes,

411
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:42,805
but if you start talking against that person and saying,

412
00:35:43,006 --> 00:35:47,022
that 'This is wrong with him, that is wrong with him',

413
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:50,670
then you are not a sahaja yogi.

414
00:35:50,871 --> 00:35:53,852
You are a sahaja yogi as long as you can see

415
00:35:54,053 --> 00:35:58,656
your own defects through introspection.

416
00:36:01,403 --> 00:36:06,800
Now many of you, I should say most of you, have got your realisation.

417
00:36:07,022 --> 00:36:09,713
You had the experience.

418
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:15,227
But some of you don't have the knowledge.

419
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:18,462
That knowledge you should acquire

420
00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:24,129
and verify whether that knowledge is really there or not.

421
00:36:28,207 --> 00:36:31,493
Like in America,

422
00:36:31,944 --> 00:36:37,849
in the NIH, which is an Institute for Health,

423
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:43,652
they wanted to test a sahaja yogi and there were doctors.

424
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:46,151
And one doctor came forward and said,

425
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:51,440
"All right, tell me on your vibration, what's wrong with me".

426
00:36:52,408 --> 00:36:57,023
So the girl said, "Sir, something wrong with your heart".

427
00:36:57,277 --> 00:36:59,237
He said, "It's correct".

428
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:05,419
Because he has had a bypass only one month back

429
00:37:06,626 --> 00:37:09,383
and he was out of hospital.

430
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:13,213
Absolutely correct, and this surprised them.

431
00:37:13,414 --> 00:37:18,960
That diagnosis, you see, kills the patient half way.

432
00:37:19,246 --> 00:37:22,603
So this is the very easy way to diagnose a person,

433
00:37:22,817 --> 00:37:25,579
just by feeling the vibration.

434
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:30,976
And they have given us such a good attention,

435
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:36,446
they want to develop Sahaja Yoga in their hospitals.

436
00:37:41,716 --> 00:37:46,269
So you should also testify yourself,

437
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:51,716
examine yourself and find out about yourself,  what are you?

438
00:37:55,319 --> 00:38:01,280
Say husband and wife -- now the wife meditates,

439
00:38:01,709 --> 00:38:06,232
she knows everything, she knows about her husband,

440
00:38:06,447 --> 00:38:10,335
what's wrong with him

441
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:26,089
and she doesn't tell him.

442
00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:29,937
She tolerates,

443
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:33,312
she doesn't complain, she doesn't ask for anything,

444
00:38:33,598 --> 00:38:35,558
she just tolerates.

445
00:38:35,812 --> 00:38:40,634
And this tolerance convinces the husband

446
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,872
that she's a higher personality than himself.

447
00:38:46,128 --> 00:38:49,826
He may be anything, but he then understands

448
00:38:50,072 --> 00:38:55,673
that this is what she has achieved, a great personality.

449
00:38:56,659 --> 00:39:02,353
We have so many imperfections, especially morally, in the West,

450
00:39:02,554 --> 00:39:08,131
people are really, I tell you, like one snake has bitten them.

451
00:39:09,591 --> 00:39:11,604
The things that people do here

452
00:39:11,805 --> 00:39:17,083
never come into the minds of people who are not developed.

453
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:22,818
So development has meant all kinds of abandonment,

454
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:29,004
all kinds of vagabond temperament,

455
00:39:29,337 --> 00:39:34,940
and they think they are very free and they can go about and enjoy.

456
00:39:35,551 --> 00:39:41,530
This style is very common,

457
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:47,363
but you just judge yourself. Are you one of these type?

458
00:39:47,564 --> 00:39:53,334
Or are you one of the people who are higher than you in their ascent.

459
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:58,479
It's a process, I must confess.

460
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,187
It is not just that you get to that point.

461
00:40:03,664 --> 00:40:06,351
Sometimes even very new sahaja yogis

462
00:40:06,552 --> 00:40:09,409
are better than very old sahaja yogis,

463
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:15,512
but because they had a very strong desire.

464
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:18,361
What are we seeking?

465
00:40:18,562 --> 00:40:22,507
We should understand why we were seeking --

466
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:26,625
because we wanted to know ourselves.

467
00:40:26,895 --> 00:40:30,276
Somehow, we knew that we have to know ourselves,

468
00:40:30,477 --> 00:40:33,429
and we did not know, so we seek.

469
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,183
We seek. We do all kinds of things,

470
00:40:36,384 --> 00:40:39,812
I mean all wrong things also in the name of seeking.

471
00:40:40,463 --> 00:40:45,904
But it is this seeking

472
00:40:46,104 --> 00:40:49,230
brings you to Sahaja Yoga.

473
00:40:49,453 --> 00:40:53,024
Then you have to get your Self realisation,

474
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:56,124
which is very easy through Kundalini.

475
00:40:56,878 --> 00:41:00,812
Kundalini works out most of the things, most of the things.

476
00:41:01,013 --> 00:41:04,354
Like somebody told me that overnight

477
00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:10,417
she gave up drinking and smoking -- overnight.

478
00:41:11,725 --> 00:41:15,238
I mean I don't tell that, I never say that.

479
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,191
But just overnight she gave up,

480
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:22,046
and she said, "I was very particular about my hair dress

481
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:25,911
and I used to make my hair dress in a different manner,

482
00:41:26,112 --> 00:41:27,708
going to the hairdressers,

483
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:31,467
spending so much time with the beautician, this, that".

484
00:41:31,668 --> 00:41:34,012
She said, "I gave it up".

485
00:41:34,273 --> 00:41:40,170
Also she said, "I used to wear dresses which were not very moral,

486
00:41:41,037 --> 00:41:43,941
then I started respecting my body

487
00:41:44,142 --> 00:41:47,560
and I started wearing proper dress".

488
00:41:48,396 --> 00:41:50,893
All this knowledge comes to you,

489
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:56,853
spontaneously it is within you, because it is all your own.

490
00:41:57,054 --> 00:42:01,317
Also if your guru tells you, you are guided.

491
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:05,248
Guru's job is to guide people.

492
00:42:05,448 --> 00:42:09,771
So at this juncture, what is lacking?

493
00:42:09,993 --> 00:42:13,889
What is lacking in Sahaja Yoga?

494
00:42:14,184 --> 00:42:16,342
That I have to tell you.

495
00:42:16,588 --> 00:42:22,525
There are so many collective disasters we have - all kinds of.

496
00:42:23,469 --> 00:42:27,668
We had many earthquakes, we had many floods,

497
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:32,744
rain, then the muds - mud came down like a river

498
00:42:32,945 --> 00:42:35,347
and so many disasters in the world

499
00:42:35,548 --> 00:42:40,223
and sahaja yogis are saved from that.

500
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:44,311
All the sahaja yogis are saved from that, no doubt,

501
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:49,586
but after being saved, what is your understanding?

502
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:52,101
What do you know?

503
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:55,875
Why these disasters are coming?

504
00:42:56,113 --> 00:43:00,605
Because Sahaja Yoga is not very collective.

505
00:43:00,835 --> 00:43:03,279
It has to become very collective.

506
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,571
It has to spread much more, all over.

507
00:43:07,777 --> 00:43:11,894
It has to go to many people, which we don't do.

508
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:16,250
We are at a standstill, or little bit we do it.

509
00:43:16,451 --> 00:43:21,329
But go all out! Look at Christ's twelve disciples!

510
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:26,123
Of course the people went into wrong things.

511
00:43:26,329 --> 00:43:32,291
But how they worked and how intensively they did it.

512
00:43:33,918 --> 00:43:37,897
That intensity if you don't have,

513
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:42,116
and if you do not completely dedicate

514
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:45,735
to the spreading of Sahaja Yoga,

515
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:51,108
then collective problems cannot be solved.

516
00:43:52,423 --> 00:43:55,200
You are busy with your daily mundane things,

517
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:57,494
and your other jobs and everything.

518
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:01,256
It's all right, in Sahaja Yoga no objection.

519
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:07,402
But you should have your attention more

520
00:44:08,267 --> 00:44:13,177
on to this side of life that -

521
00:44:13,378 --> 00:44:17,526
'What are we doing for the collective? Are we talking about it?

522
00:44:17,727 --> 00:44:19,486
Are we spreading Sahaja Yoga?

523
00:44:19,687 --> 00:44:24,346
Are we making people know about it?'

524
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:28,203
I was surprised, once I was coming by plane

525
00:44:28,442 --> 00:44:33,981
and a lady sat next to me and had very bad vibrations.

526
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:43,491
I put myself into bandhan,

527
00:44:43,737 --> 00:44:48,287
and I asked her what is she doing for her spirituality,

528
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:53,031
and she gave the name of 'Bahai' people.

529
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:57,067
"My God", I said. If these people spread out,

530
00:44:57,268 --> 00:45:01,789
 they are so spread out, they are so many!

531
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,327
So, what will happen?

532
00:45:03,528 --> 00:45:05,737
Disasters!

533
00:45:05,938 --> 00:45:08,501
They are such negative people,

534
00:45:08,702 --> 00:45:13,784
impossible that they can do any good to the world.

535
00:45:13,985 --> 00:45:18,529
And like that you see, anybody, false guru,

536
00:45:18,752 --> 00:45:23,162
how people are driven to them, how they take to them,

537
00:45:23,362 --> 00:45:25,638
and how they spread their message.

538
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,266
I have seen people singing on the road,

539
00:45:29,467 --> 00:45:31,888
singing the praise of their guru,

540
00:45:32,134 --> 00:45:36,570
and also wearing funny dresses --

541
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,237
we don't want that kind of a thing.

542
00:45:39,443 --> 00:45:43,297
But of course you have got the knowledge,

543
00:45:43,498 --> 00:45:45,932
of course you are realised souls.

544
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:50,233
But what have you done for Sahaja Yoga is the point.

545
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:55,423
You have to spread Sahaja Yoga...

546
00:45:55,939 --> 00:45:58,193
...everywhere.

547
00:45:58,526 --> 00:46:02,753
For example, you wear a badge,

548
00:46:02,954 --> 00:46:06,641
then they will ask you, "What is this supposed to be?"

549
00:46:06,842 --> 00:46:10,776
Then you have to tell them what is it, something.

550
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:13,482
You start talking about Sahaja Yoga only!

551
00:46:13,697 --> 00:46:16,670
Talk nothing else but Sahaja Yoga.

552
00:46:16,871 --> 00:46:19,855
You have to go on talking about Sahaja Yoga,

553
00:46:20,056 --> 00:46:23,704
spreading Sahaja Yoga: unless and until you do it,

554
00:46:23,905 --> 00:46:27,497
it won't become collective, and all the disasters,

555
00:46:27,698 --> 00:46:32,404
which are due to collective nonsense, you get it.

556
00:46:35,037 --> 00:46:38,134
You are saved from so many things.

557
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:43,457
Say even if there's pollution, for a sahaja yogi it won't matter.

558
00:46:43,658 --> 00:46:48,337
Even if there is a disaster of an earthquake

559
00:46:48,538 --> 00:46:50,885
the sahaja yogi will be saved.

560
00:46:51,086 --> 00:46:54,158
But why not save the whole world?

561
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:57,560
Calamities after calamities are coming,

562
00:46:57,761 --> 00:47:02,973
and if you have compassion you must think of the people

563
00:47:03,174 --> 00:47:07,861
who can get into any calamity or into any trouble.

564
00:47:08,424 --> 00:47:13,567
Of course I can cure many people, no doubt.

565
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:17,980
But I don't know how to make Sahaja Yoga very collective.

566
00:47:18,227 --> 00:47:20,692
Now you are so many people here,

567
00:47:20,893 --> 00:47:26,731
you all can start giving realisation to at least 100 people.

568
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,627
Go everywhere.

569
00:47:28,841 --> 00:47:31,799
Talk about Sahaja Yoga.

570
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,945
Sing the praise of the Divine,

571
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:39,629
and you will save the whole world.

572
00:47:39,853 --> 00:47:43,203
It is not by saving some few people

573
00:47:43,404 --> 00:47:47,811
you can have the great Satya Yuga,

574
00:47:48,012 --> 00:47:50,886
but you have also to save this Mother Earth.

575
00:47:51,087 --> 00:47:54,282
You have to save the people who are in it.

576
00:47:54,483 --> 00:47:56,695
I mean, the way these people are,

577
00:47:56,896 --> 00:48:00,725
I have seen so many of them on the television.

578
00:48:00,956 --> 00:48:05,564
Shamelessly they are talking about something which they don't know.

579
00:48:05,765 --> 00:48:09,376
And they have thousands and thousands of people behind them.

580
00:48:09,577 --> 00:48:12,939
Not that the people are stupid.

581
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,598
Not that they want to go on a wrong path,

582
00:48:16,799 --> 00:48:21,796
but these people who are false,

583
00:48:21,997 --> 00:48:25,502
or who are wrong, know how to entice them,

584
00:48:25,703 --> 00:48:28,976
how to capture them, how to talk to them.

585
00:48:29,177 --> 00:48:33,039
But a sahaja yogi, you see, if he sees somebody

586
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:39,137
with a negative vibrations will run away.

587
00:48:39,621 --> 00:48:43,764
He will escape such a society, will not go near them,

588
00:48:43,978 --> 00:48:47,645
and will say, "Oh, very bad vibrations, we don't want!".

589
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,564
So you have to be courageous

590
00:48:50,765 --> 00:48:55,874
and get into these places, talk to people and make it collective.

591
00:48:56,075 --> 00:49:01,851
Otherwise you cannot save this world from the wrath of God.

592
00:49:02,129 --> 00:49:04,960
God is wrathful, no doubt.

593
00:49:05,161 --> 00:49:08,515
For you, he'll save you, but what's the use?

594
00:49:08,716 --> 00:49:12,198
We have to save this Mother Earth.

595
00:49:12,399 --> 00:49:16,166
And for that you have to be prepared,

596
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:20,753
you have to work it out, and whenever you get a chance

597
00:49:20,954 --> 00:49:23,356
you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

598
00:49:23,557 --> 00:49:27,159
Some people told me, "Mother, if you come then it will be All right."

599
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:32,899
Why? What's so much? .... you can be also like me.

600
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:35,875
You can talk about it to people.

601
00:49:36,082 --> 00:49:38,719
I started Sahaja Yoga with one person

602
00:49:38,926 --> 00:49:42,994
and that time it was complete darkness everywhere.

603
00:49:43,195 --> 00:49:46,534
No seekers, nothing, and horrible people,

604
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:49,695
but it worked and it cleared.

605
00:49:49,896 --> 00:49:52,928
So one person can get so many sahaja yogis,

606
00:49:53,129 --> 00:49:57,036
why not you people do the same and talk about it.

607
00:49:57,237 --> 00:50:00,833
Your behaviour, your style,

608
00:50:01,034 --> 00:50:06,065
everything will definitely impress them.

609
00:50:06,296 --> 00:50:10,651
One has to work it out in such a manner

610
00:50:10,852 --> 00:50:16,757
that you achieve our goal of collective consciousness.

611
00:50:17,288 --> 00:50:20,484
It is not only for sahaja yogis, it's for everyone.

612
00:50:20,723 --> 00:50:24,529
So that all these calamities that are happening,

613
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,332
horrible things that are happening, will stop.

614
00:50:27,532 --> 00:50:31,378
Completely stop, I assure you, it can be stopped.

615
00:50:31,578 --> 00:50:33,686
Because you are always saved.

616
00:50:33,887 --> 00:50:38,371
So all people who will be getting realisation will be saved.

617
00:50:38,572 --> 00:50:40,714
Why not talk openly about it

618
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:45,667
telling people that if we do wrong, if we are immoral,

619
00:50:45,889 --> 00:50:51,234
if we are cheats, if we try to oppress others

620
00:50:51,434 --> 00:50:57,354
and we become so much a power of destruction

621
00:50:57,924 --> 00:51:03,639
then this collective

622
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:09,726
disasters will be there and I think we'll be responsible for that.

623
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,167
Everything you take up,

624
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:14,961
any subject you take up, you don't have to start an organisation

625
00:51:15,162 --> 00:51:16,477
to fight it.

626
00:51:16,678 --> 00:51:20,238
But only your power of convincing people

627
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:25,182
and bringing them to Sahaja Yoga will make such a difference.

628
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:29,854
I hope you will understand as a guru what you have to do.

629
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:34,415
As a guru there are so many things

630
00:51:34,616 --> 00:51:38,454
and as your character, yesterday, as they showed

631
00:51:38,655 --> 00:51:43,391
how Lao Tse has written about the masters,

632
00:51:43,592 --> 00:51:48,229
how they were above all of it, above turmoil,

633
00:51:48,467 --> 00:51:54,237
above jealousies, above talking loose.

634
00:51:54,832 --> 00:51:58,210
They are so great, they are the masters

635
00:51:58,411 --> 00:52:00,078
and they will be the masters

636
00:52:00,279 --> 00:52:04,948
and you will be the gurus if you try to do that.

637
00:52:05,149 --> 00:52:07,709
This is what you have to achieve.

638
00:52:07,963 --> 00:52:09,992
I know some have achieved it,

639
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:15,087
but most of you have to achieve, with compassion and love.

640
00:52:15,317 --> 00:52:18,500
May God Bless You All.
