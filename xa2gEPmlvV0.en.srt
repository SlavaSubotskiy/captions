00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,880
Guru Puja
Cabella Ligure (Italy), 23 July 2000.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:14,378
Today we are here to know about guru principle.

3
00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:23,800
What does a guru do.

4
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:48,834
Whatever you have, all the precious things
within you, he discovers them for your knowledge.

5
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:58,274
Actually it is all there - everything.

6
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:10,935
All the knowledge, all the spirituality, all
the joy, is there.

7
00:01:10,974 --> 00:01:23,020
(little laughter as a dog walks on stage)
Right time! (more laughter).

8
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:30,428
It's all contained within you.

9
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:51,015
Only thing the Guru does (is) makes you knowledgeable
about your knowledge, about your own spirit.

10
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,359
Everyone has the Spirit within himself.

11
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:04,660
Everyone has the spirituality within himself.

12
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:10,630
There is nothing that you get from outside.

13
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:24,072
But before getting this knowledge, you are
dealing, or you are living in ignorance.

14
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:35,094
In that ignorance you do not know what treasure
you have got within yourself.

15
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:49,346
So the guru's job is to make you know what
you are.

16
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:53,629
That is the first step.

17
00:02:53,836 --> 00:03:07,780
That it starts, that awakening within you
by which you know that you are not this outside

18
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,112
world, this is all an illusion.

19
00:03:11,644 --> 00:03:20,270
And you start getting enlightened within yourself.

20
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:27,901
Some people get full light and some people
get it gradually.

21
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:34,310
Essence of all the religions is that you should
know yourself.

22
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:43,753
Those people who are fighting in the name
of religion, you have to go and ask them,

23
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:53,513
you have to enquire from them, "Did your religion
make you know yourself?"

24
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:59,770
If all the religions have said one thing [it's
that], you have to do all these things just

25
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,176
to know yourself.

26
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:09,010
But people get into rituals.

27
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:15,770
They think that [by] doing all these rituals
they are near God.

28
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:28,061
They live in ignorance absolutely about themselves,
and day in and day out they work out something,

29
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:33,290
which is nothing to do with yourself'.

30
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:41,680
Lots of acrobats, prayers, pujas, these things
go on.

31
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:45,335
Because it is all ignorance.

32
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:56,522
People go on paying them money and they become
very rich and their interest is only money.

33
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:07,826
They want to take all your money, absolutely,
and make a fool out of you.

34
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:10,780
They pamper your ego.

35
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:23,720
With pampering of that ego you just start
drifting into the ocean of illusion and you

36
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:32,420
are drowned into that illusion, thinking that
you are very religious and you are just in

37
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,540
connection with God, which you are not.

38
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,946
To know God you should know your Self first.

39
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:46,071
Without knowing that, you cannot know God.

40
00:05:46,158 --> 00:05:52,760
That's essential, that you should know your
Self.

41
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:58,300
But when you know yourself, you know partly.

42
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,420
The experience is not sufficient.

43
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,205
The knowledge has to come.

44
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:14,306
And the guru gives the knowledge about your
Self.

45
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:18,506
Now you have to tally it.

46
00:06:18,617 --> 00:06:22,889
You should find out whatever your guru has
told you.

47
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:25,167
Is it true or not?

48
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:27,692
Is it correct or not?

49
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:32,670
Or is it just another illusion?

50
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:40,398
Now in this ascent people get into lots of
problems.

51
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:45,670
First and foremost is the ego problem, especially
in the west.

52
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:53,931
Ego stands up and you start thinking you are
great, you are better than others, and there

53
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:57,260
is something special about you.

54
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:06,669
This ignorance is more dangerous than the
worldly ignorance, I think, because in the

55
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:19,416
worldly ignorance, you do feel the consequences
of wrong things.

56
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:32,514
But when you are half way, when your ignorance
is that about yourself, when you are going

57
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:41,850
to a higher realm, then one should always
understand that you cannot have ego.

58
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:55,715
Then what starts is introspection.

59
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:04,926
You start looking at yourself, what's wrong
with you.

60
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:11,120
When you understand that you have ego, you
start looking at yourself.

61
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:24,320
Or when you find there is something missing
or something wrong, then also, you start introspecting.

62
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:32,985
This should be a very, very honest, very honest
effort.

63
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:38,566
Some people in Sahaja Yoga, at a very early
stage start thinking they that they are very

64
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:43,896
great and they don't need any introspection.

65
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:55,339
And they rise again into the clouds of ignorance
without achieving Selfhood, or I can call

66
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:58,247
it Self realisation.

67
00:08:58,302 --> 00:09:06,703
So you have to introspect and see for yourself
what have you been doing, what are you,

68
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:11,169
how far you have come.

69
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:16,559
How much -- please don't translate just now
all right?

70
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:21,870
You can do it later on.

71
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:26,440
You must hear with full concentration.

72
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:34,333
Even if you don't understand it will work
-- now the style of such a person changes

73
00:09:34,358 --> 00:09:35,373
gradually.

74
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:36,630
How?

75
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:49,709
First of all a person who is extremely aggressive,
hot-tempered, and full of ego, starts becoming

76
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:53,780
very gentle and mild.

77
00:09:53,860 --> 00:10:07,443
Another type which is frightened and afraid
and very cautious starts becoming fearless.

78
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:13,170
At that stage you have no fears.

79
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:23,589
You are sure that you are on the right path
and you are moving on the right lines.

80
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,970
You are not easily disturbed there.

81
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:38,019
But still you have to rise higher and higher;
where, when you meditate, you understand there

82
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:42,444
is something wrong within yourself.

83
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:48,950
You have achieved your Self realisation; you
have got the blessings of Self realisation.

84
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:57,890
Your health is good, you have got all kinds
of blessings which you cannot count.

85
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:08,924
All that is there but...still you have to
go further.

86
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:23,620
And that is to understand all the knowledge
about Sahaja Yoga.

87
00:11:23,803 --> 00:11:31,810
You have to understand through your mental
capacity, first, to begin with, then you have

88
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:37,621
to verify how far it is correct.

89
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:51,970
How far you have understood it, how far you
have worked on it, how far you know.

90
00:11:52,113 --> 00:12:07,985
And when you start seeing yourself, you start
entering into the realm of Bhakti.

91
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:17,854
You become a mild person, become a sweet person,
you don't talk too much, you don't harass

92
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:29,670
anyone; you are a very pleasant person, very
gentle, very understanding.

93
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:40,810
This person has to verify how he is behaving
towards others.

94
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:54,297
Now the attention starts moving from oneself
to another and you start seeing how you behave.

95
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:58,884
How you love.

96
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:03,775
What is the quality of your compassion?

97
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:20,190
When you love somebody without any expectations,
just love, then you are absolutely dedicated

98
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:27,852
to that person, absolutely; you just obey.

99
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:31,644
You will do anything for that person.

100
00:13:31,818 --> 00:13:39,099
If there is this love which you call as surrender.

101
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:42,800
This is just the love.

102
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:51,670
Surrender is nothing but the love, and that
love which is extremely joy-giving.

103
00:13:51,670 --> 00:14:06,735
this bhakti starts, this dedication starts,
and you are cleansed by that bhakti.

104
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:20,159
All the bad qualities you have, you can call
them, all the deficiencies you have, all the

105
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:29,346
problems you have, you understand and you
get over it.

106
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:43,430
Now if you see somebody with the same qualities,
with the same troubles, you in the love of

107
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:49,231
that person you try to tolerate.

108
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:57,189
Such a person just tolerates.

109
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:12,715
There is no aggression, and these people forgive.

110
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:18,909
Realised Souls go on forgiving; their capacity
to forgive is tremendous.

111
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:25,546
They do not bear any malice against anyone.

112
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:29,229
They don't have any anger about anyone.

113
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:35,864
They just go on tolerating and forgiving and
forgiving.

114
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:46,915
This forgiveness is just a music, I should
say, of your bhakti.

115
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:54,719
The amount of forgiveness these masters could
have can be seen from [the] life of Christ.

116
00:15:54,719 --> 00:16:01,354
They are tortured, crucified - most of the
saints were tortured.

117
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:03,926
People never liked them.

118
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:18,139
And they were crucified, but as you know that
they never resented, they never take a revenge,

119
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:24,649
they never did anything which was not compassionate.

120
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:30,083
They had compassion, and compassion for such
people

121
00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:36,738
they felt that 'Oh God, please forgive them.

122
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:43,145
What they are doing they don't know'.

123
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,011
Extremely compassionate.

124
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:49,990
And they are that, that becomes their nature.

125
00:16:49,990 --> 00:17:01,439
When it becomes their nature they become people
with complete peace.

126
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,152
They are not disturbed.

127
00:17:05,177 --> 00:17:14,683
They are never disturbed with whatever is
happening and they think it's God's will.

128
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:22,674
Because nothing can disturb them, nothing
can upset them.

129
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:30,125
They just enjoy their devotion.

130
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,714
Devotion to their guru, maybe.

131
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:40,945
Devotion to God.

132
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:52,700
In that devotion they may write beautiful
poetry, they may go on dancing, they may go

133
00:17:52,700 --> 00:18:01,450
on singing, because the peace is within and
they are enjoying themselves.

134
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:13,122
When they are alone, they are never alone,
they enjoy themselves.

135
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:27,216
They know that - "We are one with the Divine"
- and the blessing of the Divine they enjoy.

136
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:32,712
Another thing is they never take to artificiality.

137
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:43,630
They are never worried, never upset, they
are neither futuristic nor think of the past,

138
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,350
but they are in the present.

139
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:55,550
When they are in the present, they are absolutely
silent.

140
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:02,403
If there is any problem, or anything happens
to them,

141
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:07,114
they immediately go into thoughtless awareness.

142
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,099
That is what their capacity is.

143
00:19:14,124 --> 00:19:22,080
To become a guru you have to develop that
personality; not to be bound by anything.

144
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,056
Now I'll tell you my own example.

145
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:32,896
I never hurry, I'm never bothered about time.

146
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:41,430
Once I was going to America - because if you
are sure the Divine has plans for you, you

147
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:48,228
are not bothered, the Divine is looking after
you so why to bother -- I was going to America

148
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,160
and one child fell down.

149
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:57,448
I was just about to get up and go and broke
her arm.

150
00:19:57,473 --> 00:20:02,590
And when I saw the child I said "All right,
I'll put that child right".

151
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,998
"But," they said, "You are going to America!"

152
00:20:05,023 --> 00:20:08,083
I said, "I'll go in any case!

153
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:14,160
"So I cured the child, it took about half
an hour, and then I came out "All right, let's

154
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,732
go to the airport".

155
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:20,260
They said "Mother you are very late" I said,
"I'm never late.

156
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,444
Let's go!".

157
00:20:22,469 --> 00:20:30,864
We went there, to the airport, and the plane
by which I was going was out of order, so

158
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:34,681
there was another plane going to Washington
not to New York,

159
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:38,525
and I wanted to go to Washington only!

160
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:46,450
So just imagine how things work out, and we
call them 'Sahaja'.

161
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:54,084
It has worked out 'Sahaja'.

162
00:20:58,453 --> 00:21:02,593
That means it's a effortless.

163
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:22,300
But first of all your personality should be
such that your devotion is so great that Divine

164
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:33,782
is compelled to look after you...compelled
to look after you!

165
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:47,123
You have to understand that Divine force is
around you, and this Divine force is absolute

166
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:51,090
guarantee for your safety.

167
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:56,294
For everything that you want to do.

168
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:02,710
You can say that "Mother you are very powerful".

169
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,419
You can become also very powerful!

170
00:22:05,515 --> 00:22:15,920
If you get completely dedicated to the Divine
work, you will also have all the powers and

171
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:25,703
the Divine will provide all the necessary
work that you want to do, necessary time that

172
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:27,219
you have to have.

173
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:33,217
Everything is provided by the Divine.

174
00:22:33,263 --> 00:22:44,489
But the compassion, when it extends from other
people to God, or to Divine person, or to

175
00:22:44,523 --> 00:23:00,411
your guru, then it becomes very easy to live,
very simple to live, no complications, everything

176
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:06,400
is sorted out, and you are not bothered about
anything.

177
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:13,223
You just close your eyes and things work out.

178
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:23,230
Everything works out as if that's your will,
but you don't have to will it, don't have

179
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:28,530
to think about it, it just works out, but
Divine looks after everything.

180
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:37,670
It looks after your comfort, looks after your
health, everything.

181
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:51,520
And this Divine help, you do not seek, you
do not ask for, but you are a personality

182
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,689
for which the Divine is responsible.

183
00:23:55,776 --> 00:24:01,683
You are a special responsibility of the Divine.

184
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:07,595
And it knows what is good for you and what
is not.

185
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:16,520
It's an example, I can give many where I,
supposing, I thought somebody is coming to

186
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:23,762
meet me, and people told me "Mother, he's
very negative", He will never come,

187
00:24:23,787 --> 00:24:26,328
 he'll never come.

188
00:24:26,535 --> 00:24:33,151
All positive things will happen, and if a
negative things take place, then you will

189
00:24:33,176 --> 00:24:35,818
use your compassion.

190
00:24:35,843 --> 00:24:41,721
If it is negative you'll use your compassion
and you'll solve the problem.

191
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:51,771
You can solve the problems of your own, of
your surroundings, of your community.

192
00:24:51,803 --> 00:24:55,919
So now you have got your Self realisation.

193
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:59,655
How far you have gone in that I don't know.

194
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:07,756
I have a complaint about women, so many ladies,
that they don't meditate.

195
00:25:08,113 --> 00:25:15,610
That they are not looking after themselves,
they are not realised souls, and that's why

196
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:23,827
many men want to divorce them because they
think these women are good for nothing.

197
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:31,065
And some men also are like that.

198
00:25:31,105 --> 00:25:41,580
To solve this problem you have to have compassion,
and you have to, somehow or other, with compassion,

199
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:48,370
you should win over the partner of your life.

200
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:53,870
After all men are much more busy than women
are.

201
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,920
But women indulge into so many other things.

202
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:04,934
They have to look after their family, their
children, their everything.

203
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:15,170
And their mind is involved into all such mundane
things that they have no time to meditate.

204
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,727
Without meditation you cannot rise.

205
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:22,440
You have to meditate.

206
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,683
People think that: "Now we have got realisation,
so it's all right".

207
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,872
No!

208
00:26:25,897 --> 00:26:32,429
Every day you must meditate because that's
the cleansing that takes place.

209
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:37,757
With the cleansing you understand.

210
00:26:37,782 --> 00:26:46,908
You understand what is needed and what is
not needed, you are cleansed out.

211
00:26:46,995 --> 00:26:49,380
That is done by Divine.

212
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:58,140
But you must religiously meditate.

213
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:07,139
Gradually you will find your meditation will
become very deep.

214
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:18,910
You will become very, very deep and your powers
will start showing.

215
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:25,430
When you are anywhere, negativity will run
away.

216
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:32,072
All sorts of problems can be solved.

217
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:36,707
Whatever you want to do is available to you.

218
00:27:36,732 --> 00:27:46,590
Whatever is your desire to help others or
give to someone, you just get it.

219
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:51,700
Is my own experience I'm telling you.

220
00:27:51,700 --> 00:28:01,791
You have to meditate at least 10 minutes every
evening, and morning about 5 minutes.

221
00:28:01,816 --> 00:28:07,410
With complete devotion, with complete admiration.

222
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:18,200
I have seen some people here, such bhakti,
such devotion, which is shraddha - is higher

223
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,100
than bhakti - that it becomes part and parcel
of your being.

224
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:29,230
It just envelops you completely.

225
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:35,237
When you have that shraddha, it is very miraculous.

226
00:28:35,262 --> 00:28:38,793
It works so many miracles.

227
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:46,545
It's true some people were cured only thinking
of me, is a fact.

228
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:54,190
But that doesn't mean that they had the shraddha
of that level, but that means that they have

229
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,799
to develop shraddha.

230
00:28:56,824 --> 00:29:05,849
Now how to develop a shraddha, which is a
natural light of the Spirit.

231
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:18,680
Because people are trying very hard to develop
shraddha, but shraddha cannot be developed

232
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:26,230
by mental activity, by any activity, but meditation
of silence.

233
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:33,210
If you do the meditation .... I have always
told you to do meditation.

234
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:38,594
I immediately know a person who has been meditating
and who has not been.

235
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:47,430
They'll come to my puja, all right; and they'll
talk about Sahaja Yoga, they'll go out and

236
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,622
do it for popularity.

237
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:53,120
Many people are like that.

238
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,790
They go out, and for popularity they work
it out.

239
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:04,355
But inside they have not yet traced their
own Self.

240
00:30:04,395 --> 00:30:12,582
So at this development stage you should be
encouraged, and [should be] understood that

241
00:30:12,622 --> 00:30:22,050
you can reach that state very easily through
meditation and introspection.

242
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:33,040
With introspection you will develop a new
quality of understanding that, you will find

243
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,300
solutions to things.

244
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:41,980
That is another quality a person who is a
realised soul has.

245
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:49,674
It can find solutions to all your problems.

246
00:30:49,769 --> 00:31:00,115
It can, he can suggest what is the way you
can be helped.

247
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:05,553
Then a kind of a brotherhood out of the shraddha
develops.

248
00:31:05,578 --> 00:31:12,100
You may be giving big lectures on Sahaja Yoga,
you may be doing all kinds of things, but

249
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:19,227
unless and until you have shraddha, you cannot
rise.

250
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:28,769
And this shraddha is a kind of a love within
you, I should say, which spreads like gentle

251
00:31:28,794 --> 00:31:41,600
fire which doesn't burn, which doesn't give
heat, but cold, beautiful breeze-like feeling

252
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,290
within, which makes you understand.

253
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:52,918
You will never talk ill about a sahaja yogi,
never.

254
00:31:52,943 --> 00:31:58,820
I never listen to anybody who tells me something
against sahaja yogi.

255
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:07,759
Up to a point, when it is a collective complaint,
then I am little bit bothered and I talk about

256
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:09,950
it to the leader.

257
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:16,630
But otherwise if one person comes and tells
me this and this, I just tell that person

258
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,599
"You introspect yourself , it's not so".

259
00:32:20,624 --> 00:32:33,560
Finding faults with others is a common game
all human beings play.

260
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,099
They never see their own faults.

261
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:40,199
What's the use of finding faults of others?

262
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:46,023
By finding faults with others you're not going
to be helped.

263
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:52,166
Try to find faults within you, which you can
cure, which you can help,

264
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:57,001
which you can work it out.

265
00:32:57,026 --> 00:33:05,536
It's a responsibility you have, you must know,
to yourself that you better find out your

266
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:09,910
defects and get them corrected.

267
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:17,496
But some people are very proud of their fondness
-- they talk like this,

268
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:20,200
"I like this, I like that".

269
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,119
But what about the Spirit?

270
00:33:24,144 --> 00:33:28,890
You like this, you like that, then what about
your Spirit?

271
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,680
Does it like?

272
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,690
Does it enjoy?

273
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,850
They'll go on saying "I like this, I don't
like this, I don't like that!"

274
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,380
It's very common in the West.

275
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,610
Now see, some ladies have made this beautiful
carpets for me.

276
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:56,680
They are so thick that when I walk on them
I little bit lose balance, but the love with

277
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:06,295
which they are made, makes me so joyous, so
happy, that you can't imagine

278
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,838
 what I feel about them.

279
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:15,476
This joy, this ocean of joy, is within you.

280
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:27,158
And when it starts stirring up, it doesn't
torment you, it gives you beautiful -- I don't

281
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:36,247
know how to use words to express that -- it's
like a drizzle on your being, it's like a

282
00:34:36,272 --> 00:34:38,959
grace on your being.

283
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:43,556
The love of other people enthrals you.

284
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:57,169
You don't ask for it, but if you see a person
who is very loving and kind, there is real

285
00:34:57,169 --> 00:35:00,409
friendship in that kind of relationship.

286
00:35:00,409 --> 00:35:06,541
But talking ill about sahaja yogis, it's very
wrong.

287
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:13,035
And then talking to everyone that "this is
wrong with this person, he had done this,

288
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:22,598
he had done that", is very, very wrong and
creating a collective feeling against the

289
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:26,370
person -- instead of helping that person.

290
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,872
Always people are in trouble.

291
00:35:29,897 --> 00:35:33,303
Then collectively you must help that person.

292
00:35:33,328 --> 00:35:34,851
Not talk ill of that person.

293
00:35:34,876 --> 00:35:44,460
May be some mistakes, but if you start talking
against that person and saying that 'This

294
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:50,908
is wrong with him, that is wrong with him',
then you are not a sahaja yogi.

295
00:35:50,933 --> 00:36:00,391
You are a sahaja yogi as long as you can see
your own defects through introspection.

296
00:36:01,407 --> 00:36:06,972
Now many of you, I should say most of you,
have got your realisation.

297
00:36:07,075 --> 00:36:10,067
You had the experience.

298
00:36:10,092 --> 00:36:16,292
But some of you don't have the knowledge.

299
00:36:16,317 --> 00:36:22,573
That knowledge you should acquire, and verify
whether that knowledge

300
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:25,629
 is really there or not.

301
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:40,280
Like in America, in the N.I.H., which is an
Institute for Health, they wanted to test

302
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,669
a sahaja yogi, and there were doctors.

303
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:48,851
And one doctor came forward and said "All
right, tell me on your vibration

304
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:51,169
 what's wrong with me".

305
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:59,929
So the girl said, "Sir, something wrong with
your heart" and he said, "It's correct" because

306
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:09,743
he has had a bypass only one month back and
he was out of hospital.

307
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:13,489
Absolutely correct, and this surprised them.

308
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:18,859
That diagnosis, you see, kills the patient
half way.

309
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:25,887
So this is the very easy way to diagnose a
person, just by feeling the vibration.

310
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:30,880
And they have given us such a good attention,

311
00:37:30,905 --> 00:37:37,510
they want to develop Sahaja Yoga in their hospitals.

312
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:50,395
So you should also testify yourself, examine
yourself and find out about yourself,

313
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,560
 what are you?

314
00:37:55,337 --> 00:38:06,560
Say husband and wife -- now the wife meditates,
she knows everything, she knows about her

315
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:26,678
husband, what's wrong with him and she doesn't
tell him.

316
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:35,777
She tolerates, she doesn't complain, she doesn't
ask for anything, she just tolerates.

317
00:38:35,864 --> 00:38:46,089
And this tolerance convinces the husband that
she's a higher personality than himself.

318
00:38:46,136 --> 00:38:53,584
He may be anything, but he then understands
that this is what she has achieved,

319
00:38:53,609 --> 00:38:56,731
 a great personality.

320
00:38:56,756 --> 00:39:03,510
We have so many imperfections, especially
morally, in the West, people are really, I

321
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,747
tell you, like one snake has bitten them.

322
00:39:09,454 --> 00:39:17,510
The things that people do here never come
into the minds of people who are not developed.

323
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:29,317
So development has meant all kinds of abandonment,
all kinds of vagabond temperament, and they

324
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:35,602
think they are very free and they can go about
and enjoy.

325
00:39:35,627 --> 00:39:45,370
This style is very common, but you just judge
yourself.

326
00:39:45,395 --> 00:39:48,349
Are you one of these type?

327
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:54,990
Or are you one of the people who are higher
than you in their ascent.

328
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:58,309
It's a process, I must confess.

329
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:03,779
It is not just [that] you get to that point.

330
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:13,250
Sometimes even very new sahaja yogis are better
than very old sahaja yogis, but because they

331
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,530
had a very strong desire.

332
00:40:16,555 --> 00:40:18,790
What are we seeking?

333
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:26,340
We should understand why we were seeking -- because
we wanted to know ourselves.

334
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:32,216
Somehow, we knew that we have to know ourselves,
and we did not know.

335
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:33,612
So we seek.

336
00:40:33,637 --> 00:40:34,692
We seek.

337
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:40,565
We do all kinds of things, I mean all wrong
things also in the name of seeking.

338
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:49,451
But it is this seeking brings you to Sahaja
Yoga.

339
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:56,829
Then you have to get your Self realisation,
which is very easy through Kundalini.

340
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:01,048
Kundalini works out most of the things, most
of the things.

341
00:41:01,073 --> 00:41:09,515
Like somebody told me that overnight she gave
up drinking and smoking -- overnight.

342
00:41:11,463 --> 00:41:15,600
I mean I don't tell that, I never say that.

343
00:41:15,631 --> 00:41:22,100
But just overnight she gave up, and she said
"I was very particular about my hair dress

344
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:28,819
and I used to make my hair dress in a different
manner, going to the hairdressers, spending

345
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,040
so much time with the beautician, this, that".

346
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,384
She said, "I gave it up".

347
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:43,540
Also she said "I used to wear dresses which
were not very moral, then I started respecting

348
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,530
my body and I started wearing proper dress".

349
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:57,099
All this knowledge comes to you, spontaneously
it is within you, because it is all your own.

350
00:41:57,124 --> 00:42:01,620
Also if your guru tells you, you are guided.

351
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:05,265
Guru's job is to guide people.

352
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:09,850
So at this juncture, what is lacking?

353
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:14,072
What is lacking in Sahaja Yoga?

354
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:16,572
That I have to tell you.

355
00:42:16,627 --> 00:42:23,275
There are so many collective disasters we
have - all kinds of.

356
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:33,089
We had many earthquakes, we had many floods,
rain, then the muds - mud came down like a

357
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:40,689
river; and so many disasters in the world
and sahaja yogis are saved from that.

358
00:42:40,714 --> 00:42:46,545
All the sahaja yogis are saved from that,
no doubt, but after being saved,

359
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:49,697
 what is your understanding?

360
00:42:49,794 --> 00:42:52,421
What do you know?

361
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:56,167
Why these disasters are coming?

362
00:42:56,192 --> 00:43:00,908
Because Sahaja Yoga is not very collective.

363
00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:03,689
It has to become very collective.

364
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:07,796
It has to spread much more, all over.

365
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:12,020
It has to go to many people, which we don't
do.

366
00:43:12,045 --> 00:43:16,512
We are at a standstill, or little bit we do
it.

367
00:43:16,591 --> 00:43:18,608
But go all out!

368
00:43:18,633 --> 00:43:21,643
Look at Christ's twelve disciples!

369
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:26,368
Of course the people went into wrong things.

370
00:43:26,447 --> 00:43:33,933
But how they worked and how intensively they
did it.

371
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:43,700
That intensity if you don't have, and if you
do not completely dedicate to the spreading

372
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:52,050
of Sahaja Yoga, then collective problems cannot
be solved.

373
00:43:52,075 --> 00:43:57,780
You are busy with your daily mundane things,
and your other jobs and everything; it's all

374
00:43:57,805 --> 00:44:01,534
right, in Sahaja Yoga no objection.

375
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:14,025
But you should have your attention more on
to this side of life that - 'What are we doing

376
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,855
for the collective?

377
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,831
Are we talking about it?

378
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:19,761
Are we spreading Sahaja Yoga?

379
00:44:19,786 --> 00:44:24,340
Are we making people know about it?'

380
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,440
I was surprised, once I was coming by plane

381
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:36,457
and a lady sat next to me and had very bad vibrations.

382
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:49,547
I put myself into bandhan, and I asked her
what is she doing for her spirituality, and

383
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:53,099
she gave the name of 'Bahai' people.

384
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:56,159
"My God" I said.

385
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,649
If these people spread out, they are so spread
out, they are so many!

386
00:45:01,649 --> 00:45:03,640
So, what will happen?

387
00:45:03,665 --> 00:45:05,840
Disasters!

388
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:13,889
They are such negative people, impossible
that they can do any good to the world.

389
00:45:13,889 --> 00:45:23,370
And like that you see, anybody, false guru,
how people are driven to them, how they take

390
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,960
to them, and how they spread their message.

391
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:34,840
I have seen people singing on the road, singing
the praise of their guru, and also wearing

392
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:39,620
funny dresses -- we don't want that kind of
a thing.

393
00:45:39,645 --> 00:45:46,262
But of course you have got the knowledge,
of course you are realised souls.

394
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:50,513
But what have you done for Sahaja Yoga is
the point.

395
00:45:50,568 --> 00:45:57,122
You have to spread Sahaja Yoga...everywhere.

396
00:45:57,407 --> 00:46:06,939
For example, you wear a badge, then they will
ask you "What is this supposed to be?"

397
00:46:06,939 --> 00:46:11,084
Then you have to tell them what is it, something.

398
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:13,809
You start talking about Sahaja Yoga only!

399
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:16,950
Talk nothing else but Sahaja Yoga.

400
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:23,730
You have to go on talking about Sahaja Yoga,
spreading Sahaja Yoga: unless and until you

401
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:29,510
do it, it won't become collective, and all
the disasters, which are due to collective

402
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:34,084
nonsense, you get it.

403
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:38,471
You are saved from so many things.

404
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:43,717
Say even if there's pollution, for a sahaja
yogi it won't matter.

405
00:46:43,742 --> 00:46:51,148
Even if there is a disaster of an earthquake
the sahaja yogi will be saved.

406
00:46:51,173 --> 00:46:54,700
But why not save the whole world?

407
00:46:54,725 --> 00:47:02,740
Calamities after calamities are coming, and
if you have compassion you must think of the

408
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:08,608
people who can get into any calamity or into
any trouble.

409
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:13,620
Of course I can cure many people, no doubt.

410
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:18,089
But I don't know how to make Sahaja Yoga very
collective.

411
00:47:18,089 --> 00:47:26,939
Now you are so many people here, you all can
start giving realisation to at least 100 people.

412
00:47:26,939 --> 00:47:28,750
Go everywhere.

413
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:32,087
Talk about Sahaja Yoga.

414
00:47:32,112 --> 00:47:40,059
Sing the praise of the Divine, and you will
save the whole world.

415
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:49,150
It is not by saving some few people you can
have the great Satya Yuga, but you have also

416
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:51,730
to save this Mother Earth.

417
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,309
You have to save the people who are in it.

418
00:47:54,309 --> 00:48:00,965
I mean, the way these people are, I have seen
so many of them on the television.

419
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:05,931
They, shamelessly they are talking about something
which they don't know.

420
00:48:05,956 --> 00:48:09,689
And they have thousands and thousands of people
behind them.

421
00:48:09,714 --> 00:48:13,262
Not that the people are stupid.

422
00:48:13,287 --> 00:48:23,369
Not that they want to go on a wrong path,
but these people who are false, or who are

423
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:29,162
wrong, know how to entice them, how to capture
them, how to talk to them.

424
00:48:29,218 --> 00:48:39,129
But a sahaja yogi, you see, if he sees somebody
with a negative vibrations will run away.

425
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:46,127
He will escape such a society, will not go
near them, and will say "Oh, very bad vibrations,

426
00:48:46,169 --> 00:48:47,982
we don't want!".

427
00:48:48,007 --> 00:48:56,142
So you have to be courageous and get into
these places, talk to people and make it collective.

428
00:48:56,167 --> 00:49:01,659
Otherwise you cannot save this world from
the wrath of God.

429
00:49:01,659 --> 00:49:04,584
God is wrathful, no doubt.

430
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:08,849
For you, he'll save you, but what's the use?

431
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:12,747
We have to save this Mother Earth.

432
00:49:12,772 --> 00:49:20,560
And for that you have to be prepared, you
have to work it out, and whenever you get

433
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,694
a chance you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

434
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:28,220
Some people told me "Mother, if you come then
it will be All right" Why?

435
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:33,760
What's so much? .... you can be also like
me.

436
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,193
You can talk about it to people.

437
00:49:36,218 --> 00:49:43,216
I started Sahaja Yoga with one person and,
that time, it was complete darkness everywhere.

438
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:49,994
No seekers, nothing, and horrible people,
but it worked and it cleared.

439
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:55,334
So one person can get so many sahaja yogis,
why not you people do the same

440
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,278
and talk about it.

441
00:49:57,303 --> 00:50:06,248
Your behaviour, your style, everything will
definitely impress them.

442
00:50:06,273 --> 00:50:16,966
One has to work it out in such a manner that
you achieve our goal of collective consciousness.

443
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:20,812
It is not only for sahaja yogis, it's for
everyone.

444
00:50:20,845 --> 00:50:27,540
So that all these calamities that are happening,
horrible things that are happening, will stop.

445
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,483
Completely stop, I assure you, it can be stopped.

446
00:50:31,586 --> 00:50:34,018
Because you are always saved.

447
00:50:34,043 --> 00:50:38,609
So all people who will be getting realisation
will be saved.

448
00:50:38,634 --> 00:50:45,669
Why not talk openly about it telling people
that if we do wrong, if we are immoral, if

449
00:50:45,694 --> 00:50:57,860
we are cheats, if we try to oppress others
and we become so much a power of destruction

450
00:50:57,885 --> 00:51:09,692
then this collective disasters will be there
and I think we'll be responsible for that.

451
00:51:09,961 --> 00:51:15,020
Everything you take up, any subject you take
up, you don't have to start an organisation

452
00:51:15,045 --> 00:51:16,830
to fight it.

453
00:51:16,855 --> 00:51:23,418
But only your power of convincing people and
bringing them to Sahaja Yoga will make such

454
00:51:23,443 --> 00:51:25,089
a difference.

455
00:51:25,089 --> 00:51:29,720
I hope you will understand as a guru what
you have to do.

456
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:39,439
As a guru there are so many things and as
your character, yesterday, as they showed

457
00:51:39,439 --> 00:51:48,510
how Lao Tse has written about the masters,
how they were above all of it, above turmoil,

458
00:51:48,535 --> 00:51:54,867
above jealousies, above talking loose.

459
00:51:54,923 --> 00:52:01,754
They are so great, they are the masters and
they will be the masters and you will be the

460
00:52:01,779 --> 00:52:05,379
gurus if you try to do that.

461
00:52:05,379 --> 00:52:07,986
This is what you have to achieve.

462
00:52:08,011 --> 00:52:15,063
I know some have achieved it, but most of
you have to achieve, with compassion and love.

463
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,090
May God Bless You All
