00:00:05,594 --> 00:00:10,992
Tad Nishkala
by Shrī Ādi Shaṅkarāchārya

2
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:19,392
There’s a beautiful saying of Adi
Shankaracharya, Tad Nishkala,

3
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:25,702
about Brahma Tattwa. I’m that
Brahma.

4
00:00:25,903 --> 00:00:29,492
On that. If you have? Let Me see.

5
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:34,585
That’s the best way to understand 
what you are.

6
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:41,265
Just bring it. It’s very famous.
Have you got it?

7
00:00:41,426 --> 00:00:45,874
Yogi: Dakshina Murti?
Shri Mataji: No, not that, another one.

8
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:52,382
Just bring it. Have you got the book?
Yogi: Can you bring the book to Shri Mataji?

9
00:00:59,364 --> 00:01:02,054
This is the one.

10
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,695
Nirvana Shatakam. This one is the one.

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,358
You just read it in English language.
I don't need it.

12
00:01:15,687 --> 00:01:22,140
When you have got your Nirvana,
what happens to you – it says that.

13
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:29,421
Tad Nishkala is also known
as the Atma or Nirvana Shatakam –

14
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:35,734
six verses on the theme of spiritual
liberation.

15
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:50,119
Mano’buddhi ahaṅkār
chittāni n’āham

16
00:01:50,370 --> 00:02:04,219
Na cha shrotra jihve
na cha ghrāna netre

17
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:16,150
Na cha vyoma bhūmir
na tejo na vāyuhu

18
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:44,276
Chid’ānanda rūpah
Shiv’oham Shiv’oham (x 2)

19
00:02:44,494 --> 00:02:56,190
Na cha prāna saoṅdñyao
na vai pancha-vāyur

20
00:02:56,391 --> 00:03:07,840
Na vā sapta-dhātur
na vā pancha-koshah

21
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:18,737
Na vāk pāni-pādau
na ch’opasthapāyū

22
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:45,643
Chid’ānanda rūpah
Shiv’oham Shiv’oham (x 2)

23
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:57,244
Na me dvesha-rāgau
na me lobha-mohau

24
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:09,433
Mado n’aeva me n’aeva
mātsarya-bhāvah

25
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:20,054
Na dharmo na ch’ārtho
na kāmo na mokshah

26
00:04:20,255 --> 00:04:45,288
Chid’ānanda rūpah
Shiv’oham Shiv’oham (x 2)

27
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:55,866
Na punyam na pāpam
na saukhyam na duhkham

28
00:04:56,067 --> 00:05:06,452
Na mantro na tīrtham
na vedā na yadñyāhā

29
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:16,511
Aham bhojanam n’aeva
bhojyam na bhoktā

30
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:41,374
Chid’ānanda rūpah
Shiv’oham Shiv’oham (x 2)

31
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:51,943
Na me mṛutyu shaṅkā
na me jāti bhedah

32
00:05:52,144 --> 00:06:03,546
Pitā n’aeva me n’aeva
mātā, na janma

33
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:14,300
Na bandhur na mitram
gurūr n’aeva shishyah

34
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:40,443
Chid’ānanda rūpah
Shiv’oham Shiv’oham (x 2)

35
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:50,451
Aham nirvikalpo
nirākāra rūpo

36
00:06:50,652 --> 00:07:01,527
Vibhur-vyāpya sarvatra
sarv’endriyāni

37
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:12,490
Sadā me samatvam
na muktir na bandhah

38
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:35,735
Chid’ānanda rūpah
Shiv’oham Shiv’oham (x 2)

39
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:49,235
Shiv’oham Shiv’oham (x 2)

40
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:56,544
That’s what you are. You are eternal
bliss and awareness.

41
00:07:56,745 --> 00:08:01,528
The consciousness, the pure consciousness.

42
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:06,552
I think, this must be – everybody must
remember by heart.

43
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,427
And must say in all the ashrams.

44
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:14,021
That’s a very good way of remembering
what you are.

45
00:08:14,222 --> 00:08:17,091
May God bless you.
