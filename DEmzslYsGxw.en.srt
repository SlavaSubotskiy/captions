1
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:59,282
Today is the first day, New Year's Day, according
to the Shalivahana Calendar, who were My forefathers.

2
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:07,412
And in the whole of Maharashtra, it is regarded
as the New Year Day and the best day to start

3
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:10,492
anything.

4
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:17,232
So today I've decided to have Mahamaya Puja.

5
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:30,142
I have never talked about Mahamaya, as it
is not to be talked or told - it's a secret,

6
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:34,302
as they say.

7
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:44,812
It's the basic of Sahaja Yoga, I should say,
because it's described, when the Goddess comes

8
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:53,772
in the Sahasrara, the Shakti, She is Mahamaya
- "Sahasrare Mahamaya," already described.

9
00:03:53,772 --> 00:04:02,812
She has to be the Mahamaya, means She should
camouflage Herself fully.

10
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:12,962
Nobody should be able to know Her as the Goddess,
to begin with; and even if they get Realization,

11
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:20,311
they should not reach to the end of it.

12
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:22,672
There are many reasons for that.

13
00:04:22,672 --> 00:04:25,114
The first thing: the job.

14
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:28,902
The job of Mahamaya was to give Realization.

15
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:37,112
Now, if I had come on a tiger with a sword
in My hand, nobody would have stood near Me.

16
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:41,622
You all would have run away from Me.

17
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:49,542
In any other form, if the Goddess had come,
She could not have done what She was supposed

18
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:50,732
to do.

19
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:59,611
Moreover, only if She had come as the Mother
of Christ, or Shri Sitaji, or you can say

20
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:03,232
Fatima - they all ended their lives.

21
00:05:03,232 --> 00:05:10,291
They had to go away from this world so early,
I mean.

22
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:13,282
They couldn't do any work whatsoever.

23
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:21,092
Now this work, difficult work of giving Realization
to others, is very intricate.

24
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:30,621
It has to work out in such a manner that nobody
feels that it is done by some great personality

25
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:36,071
or with a great awe or fear.

26
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:43,401
So the Mahamaya Incarnation has to come, that
people can come closer.

27
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:56,601
Also, it has one advantage, very great advantages,
that when a simple person who's just a housewife

28
00:05:56,601 --> 00:06:01,961
starts giving Realization, people are flabbergasted.

29
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:06,041
Also they think, "If She can do it, why not
we do it?

30
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,221
After all, She's just an ordinary housewife.

31
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:11,041
So, it's all right.

32
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,751
If She can do something, we can also do it."

33
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:23,501
So they have self-confidence, you see, and,
being a Mother, She does Her loving part,

34
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:27,232
Her compassion, but the greatest is the patience.

35
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:33,142
You see, none of them had so much patience,
all these Incarnations who came.

36
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:40,401
You see how they disappeared from this Mother
Earth quickly, I'd say, by some excuse or

37
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,401
other.

38
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:49,291
But I had to stay, I don't know how long,
but it has to be done up to a point, this

39
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,331
work of giving Realization.

40
00:06:51,331 --> 00:07:04,422
The third thing was that you have to be identified
into My Body, into My cells of My Body, but

41
00:07:04,422 --> 00:07:13,582
this is a more difficult task because supposing
one of you becomes stupid, becomes foolish,

42
00:07:13,582 --> 00:07:15,112
quarrelsome.

43
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:19,852
Anything you do, any small thing, it hurts
Me.

44
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:22,952
It has to, but I don't think about Myself.

45
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:25,302
I always think about you.

46
00:07:25,302 --> 00:07:29,841
So it's an indication to Me that something
has gone wrong somewhere.

47
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:32,602
Somebody is doing something wrong to somebody.

48
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:35,522
Some Sahaja Yogis are being tortured.

49
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,371
Some are sick.

50
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:42,691
Anything like that, I work it out very intensely
and intimately.

51
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:48,732
Recently, today only, they told Me somebody
has got meningitis in Australia.

52
00:07:48,732 --> 00:07:51,292
Immediately, I gave bandhan.

53
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:59,522
I'm sure such a person should be cured if
she has any faith in Me and she's in My being.

54
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:04,232
Or somebody is ill somewhere, they tell Me
and such a person is saved.

55
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:05,802
They call it a miracle.

56
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:08,751
It is not a miracle.

57
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:11,362
It's not a miracle.

58
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:14,792
It's again the Mahamaya's blessings are like
this.

59
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:17,142
You can't see how you are inside Me.

60
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:19,072
You can't see your reflection within Me.

61
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:20,072
You can't see.

62
00:08:20,072 --> 00:08:21,471
This is Mahamaya.

63
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:27,322
This is the secret part of it, that you don't
know; and then when I feel the pain and if

64
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:32,642
I try, look at it, because I have power to
cures, so you get cured.

65
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:38,061
You don't know how it happens.

66
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:59,031
Collectively, whatever you feel, I get it
in My Body.

67
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:06,691
For example, collectively, if you have a left
Vishuddhi, I get it.

68
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:12,732
If you have, say, right Vishuddhi, I get it.

69
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:21,781
Any Chakra that you catch, collectively, I
get that problem and I have to solve it because

70
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:24,422
it troubles Me, so I solve it.

71
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:29,431
It's a compulsion that I have to solve it.

72
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:33,142
Now in doing so, you see, you might think,
"Mother, we are troubling."

73
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:34,281
You are not.

74
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:35,931
It's My doing.

75
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:39,021
I have taken you into Myself.

76
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:41,482
You haven't.

77
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:44,831
So you don't have to worry as to, as if you
are troubling Me.

78
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:45,831
It's My own doing.

79
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:47,052
It's My own work.

80
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:48,052
It's My own responsibility.

81
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:51,922
And if I have done it, it's done it because
I am supposed to do it.

82
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:56,941
That's the job I have to do.

83
00:09:56,941 --> 00:10:00,132
So there's nothing to feel bad about it.

84
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,691
But now, what is the purpose?

85
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:13,742
As I told you, is that I could come close
to you and I need not, sort of, fill you with

86
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:20,961
fear or awedness, or even a feeling that I
am not a human being.

87
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:26,172
I behave exactly like human being, I react
exactly like human beings and all these powers

88
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:28,362
are hidden within Myself.

89
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:32,422
Unless and until you are a realized soul,
you won't understand.

90
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:34,211
Whatever you may do, you won't understand.

91
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:40,382
Or maybe in the previous life you had your
Realization, or maybe also you have done such

92
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:43,642
tremendous punyas that you can recognize.

93
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:48,382
There are people like that who have done it.

94
00:10:48,382 --> 00:11:00,042
But to make it more, sort of, congenial to
you is to become absolutely a human being.

95
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:05,672
So I married, I have children, I have grandchildren
and I do shopping, as you see.

96
00:11:05,672 --> 00:11:08,352
People are surprised how I take Coca-Cola.

97
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:11,232
I'm not supposed to take Coca-Cola!

98
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:14,431
Or I eat popcorn.

99
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:16,042
They're surprised.

100
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:19,362
But I have to be just like you.

101
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:22,022
But inside I am not.

102
00:11:22,022 --> 00:11:23,022
Outside I am.

103
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:32,792
You see, My attention is such that it penetrates
into everything, and I remember each and every

104
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,802
thing very well.

105
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:37,372
My memory's very good, even at this age.

106
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:44,581
So, you see, this attention itself is very
penetrating, and when it penetrates it carries

107
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:49,862
with it all the powers that are required,
and acts.

108
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:56,502
It's a tremendous machinery, I should say,
which is very subtle and works wonders.

109
00:11:56,502 --> 00:12:01,562
So you start telling Me that there is a miracle
that has happened, miracle that has happened.

110
00:12:01,562 --> 00:12:09,062
Nothing is a miracle because if you're all
in My Body and if My Body is divine, then

111
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,081
what is a miracle?

112
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:14,941
It's all the communication, as this hand can
communicate with this hand, I communicate

113
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:16,282
with you.

114
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:25,352
But one thing is definite, that you should
not get lost with this rupa of Mahamaya.

115
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:29,261
It's a very dangerous thing because once you
get lost, "Oh, Mother!

116
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:35,452
After all" - you see, like that - then it
doesn't act, it doesn't work out.

117
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:44,102
It's not a casual thing, but I want to live
very casually Myself to show that I'm casual,

118
00:12:44,102 --> 00:12:45,732
but I am not.

119
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:52,382
While you should not pay your attention casually,
that won't work out because you are in My

120
00:12:52,382 --> 00:12:53,382
Body.

121
00:12:53,382 --> 00:13:02,922
Say, every cell in My Body is aware, and every
cell has a reflector.

122
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:07,071
I don't know about, you know about it, but
there is a reflector in us, which works on

123
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:09,391
remote control.

124
00:13:09,391 --> 00:13:12,752
So it works on remote control on your attention
also.

125
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:14,662
If your attention is not all right, it corrects.

126
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:20,331
It puts you - that's the best way we could
evolve human beings.

127
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:28,452
There was no other way out, because the attention
of the people is, on the whole, in the whole

128
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:31,652
world, is not yet on the Spirit.

129
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:35,712
But suddenly, they get a glimpse that there
must be something beyond.

130
00:13:35,712 --> 00:13:38,691
So many religions have come, so many have
talked about it.

131
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:46,592
So, they may say about it, they may talk about
it, but still the consciousness that we have

132
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:52,071
to be the Spirit is among very few people
and they are the ones called as the seekers

133
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:55,001
of truth, while the rest of the people are
not.

134
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,331
They are busy with this or that.

135
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:57,331
"Oh, I'm very happy.

136
00:13:57,331 --> 00:13:58,553
I'm very happy with myself.

137
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:00,511
You enjoy your holiday.

138
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:03,131
I'll enjoy my holiday."

139
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:05,561
Like that they talk.

140
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:13,131
So under these circumstances, one had to come
in a camouflage, enter into like - you see,

141
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:18,842
they are like enemies, I would say, enemies
of God's Love.

142
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:25,172
So you have to enter into them like a spy,
camouflaging yourself, you see, and make them

143
00:14:25,172 --> 00:14:26,941
dance here, here and there.

144
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:30,172
Let them get lost a little bit here and there.

145
00:14:30,172 --> 00:14:36,132
Let them see for themselves because with Mahamaya,
you see, She allows you.

146
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:41,192
Now, there are some Sahaja Yogis who left
Sahaja Yoga, went off.

147
00:14:41,192 --> 00:14:45,602
I said, "All right, if they have gone, very
good.

148
00:14:45,602 --> 00:14:47,831
Good riddance of bad rubbish.

149
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:48,831
Doesn't matter."

150
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,372
And then they again come back.

151
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:52,482
"Mother, this happened to us.

152
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:54,022
That happened to us.

153
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:55,102
Somebody got this.

154
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,102
Somebody got that.

155
00:14:56,102 --> 00:15:00,372
We met with an accident, then somebody got
the sickness.

156
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:03,172
Somebody is very unhappy.

157
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:06,242
We broke our marriage."

158
00:15:06,242 --> 00:15:17,261
All kinds of things and when they say like
this, I mean, they do like this, I just smile.

159
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:18,691
So it's a bad coin.

160
00:15:18,691 --> 00:15:20,072
All right, doesn't matter.

161
00:15:20,072 --> 00:15:26,272
Again they come back to Sahaja Yoga, but they
are left behind than others.

162
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:31,372
They come up, but slowly, because they have
suffered, so they have come.

163
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:37,492
In a way, there's a good example for others
that we don't want to suffer any more.

164
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:43,972
The sufferings do not come from Mahamaya,
by any chance.

165
00:15:43,972 --> 00:15:58,272
On the contrary, once you have called Me the
Mother, you see, there is a protective attention

166
00:15:58,272 --> 00:15:59,842
on you.

167
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:08,902
Then you misbehave, you cross all the limits
and things, then it acts on you.

168
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:14,272
This action has taken place in many cases.

169
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:20,522
Some of them have come back, some are still
hanging around and are doing wrong things,

170
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:25,061
because they have done terribly wrong things
and they know they'll be found out.

171
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:29,751
Now the worst thing that happens in Sahaja
Yoga that people try to make money out of

172
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:36,691
Me because they know I don't understand money,
I don't understand banking and I'm very bad

173
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:43,162
at it; but I'm not.

174
00:16:43,162 --> 00:16:44,162
I know everything.

175
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:45,162
I know everything about everyone.

176
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:46,352
They tell me lies.

177
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:50,172
I know that they're telling Me lies, but is
allowed.

178
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:53,311
Do what you like in Sahaja Yoga.

179
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:56,992
You, yourself, will have to pay for it.

180
00:16:56,992 --> 00:17:03,501
It's something so great with this Mahamaya
rup, that, directly, I don't have to say anything.

181
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,571
You don't even know that it's done.

182
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:08,681
When it happens, they come rushing to Me,
"Mother, it has happened."

183
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:16,371
Now, I have not done anything directly, neither
indirectly, but once you go out of the protection

184
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:22,131
of your Mother, there are all negative forces
all around you, which also you don't see because

185
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:23,652
you are partly blind.

186
00:17:23,652 --> 00:17:27,752
You couldn't see your Mother and you couldn't
see these negative forces also.

187
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:33,751
Then you fall a prey to their talk, things,
whatever it is, or maybe into some paradoxical

188
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:35,251
culture, as you have here.

189
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:37,691
You may fall a prey to that.

190
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:42,831
There's somebody I know in Sahaja Yoga who
has gone now and he's now drinking a lot and

191
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:46,951
he's doing all kinds of things.

192
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:52,871
So such a person gets lost because of his
doings.

193
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,571
I am not doing anything to him.

194
00:17:55,571 --> 00:18:00,561
If you are with Me, if you are in Sahaja Yoga,
you are protected, you are looked after.

195
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:06,032
But you have to stick on, you have to have
faith and even if there's any problem, it

196
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:07,032
gets solved.

197
00:18:07,032 --> 00:18:14,022
But those who have gone out of it, who go
beyond My reach, then they suffer.

198
00:18:14,022 --> 00:18:20,071
So, even indirectly, I would say, I'm not
in any way harming them because I've decided

199
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:22,371
not to harm anyone.

200
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:23,732
That I have decided on.

201
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:27,552
Especially those who call Me "Mother", I don't
want to harm them.

202
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:28,552
But they get harmed.

203
00:18:28,552 --> 00:18:31,141
No doubt, they get harmed very badly.

204
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:36,441
So, if it has happened, just take it up, "All
right, doesn't matter.

205
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:37,511
Mother forgives everyone.

206
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:38,612
It has happened, has happened.

207
00:18:38,612 --> 00:18:40,922
This is a lesson for me.

208
00:18:40,922 --> 00:18:45,751
It was something because of it happened and
now I'm back."

209
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:52,352
And then you become sometimes a better Sahaja
Yogi than many of them.

210
00:18:52,352 --> 00:19:01,862
This kind of happening is very common in every
country.

211
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:06,202
But you see, this whole culture, I feel, is
so paradoxical.

212
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:13,402
Whole culture is so paradoxical, and what
is paid for is something that is ugly.

213
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:18,032
What is paid for is something that is sinful.

214
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:22,662
Whatever that is filthy, dirty is paid for
and accepted.

215
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:29,072
It's very paradoxical because it goes against
growth of spirituality.

216
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:33,292
One side, you are spiritual, you want to be
spiritual.

217
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:39,241
Another side you have this paradoxical culture,
which takes you down to hell.

218
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:43,402
It's like a story once Babamama told Me.

219
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:46,882
Very interesting story it is.

220
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:54,292
He said that some people did lots of punyas,
so they were taken to heaven, but they saw

221
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:56,012
everybody was meditating, nicely enjoying.

222
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:57,662
He said, "What is this?

223
00:19:57,662 --> 00:19:59,972
We did this also with Sahaja Yoga.

224
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:02,052
What's the use of doing it here again?

225
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:06,502
We should have something else, so let's have
a look at the hell."

226
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:12,462
So they went down to see the hell and outside
they were having all these paradoxical culture

227
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:16,432
of nude women and nude men dancing, shouting,
screaming.

228
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,882
Dirty, filthy things going on there.

229
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:23,982
So they said, "This seems to be different,
you know."

230
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:28,302
So the people who were doing all these acts,
they asked, "Why are you here?"

231
00:20:28,302 --> 00:20:32,972
They said, "We've come here only for seeing
the hell."

232
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:34,362
"Oh, all right.

233
00:20:34,362 --> 00:20:35,362
There are peepholes.

234
00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:36,362
You see through them."

235
00:20:36,362 --> 00:20:40,032
So they had big, big holes, out of which they
started seeing.

236
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:48,622
So in one hole they saw people being put into
some sort of a filth, a pus and this and that.

237
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,332
Another into feces, this, that.

238
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:57,692
Another into a sort of a mire out of which
they could not come out, shouting.

239
00:20:57,692 --> 00:21:03,252
Then there's another one where they were boiled
in the boiling oil and some were beaten up.

240
00:21:03,252 --> 00:21:06,962
There were snakes and scorpions and this and
that.

241
00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:08,882
They said, "What is this all?"

242
00:21:08,882 --> 00:21:10,762
"That is hell you wanted to see.

243
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:11,762
That is hell.

244
00:21:11,762 --> 00:21:12,922
You want to go, you can go there."

245
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:17,372
So they said, "What are you doing here?"

246
00:21:17,372 --> 00:21:20,312
"This is publicity department.

247
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,292
For hell."

248
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:31,942
They ran back to heaven and asked forgiveness
that "We don't want, we don't want this hell,

249
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:34,302
had enough of it."

250
00:21:34,302 --> 00:21:37,712
So, like that, you see, the whole world is
a camouflage.

251
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:46,622
If you see, this is an anti-Mahamaya.

252
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:51,532
So they say that this maya is created by God.

253
00:21:51,532 --> 00:21:52,902
No.

254
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:59,812
Maya that God has created is this world, this
whole universe and all that.

255
00:21:59,812 --> 00:22:03,902
But this illusive life is created by human
beings.

256
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:10,482
Absolutely, through their projections of their
brains and mental capacities, they have projected

257
00:22:10,482 --> 00:22:13,192
because money is everything.

258
00:22:13,192 --> 00:22:17,842
If money is everything, by hook or crook,
if you have to get the money, then do what

259
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:18,842
you like.

260
00:22:18,842 --> 00:22:23,932
And every day you read in the newspaper, I
mean horrible stories about how people want

261
00:22:23,932 --> 00:22:28,862
to make money, how they want to sell their
daughters, how they want to sell their wives.

262
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:32,242
Anything is all right as long as you have
money.

263
00:22:32,242 --> 00:22:34,972
If you can make money, nothing matters.

264
00:22:34,972 --> 00:22:45,742
So this is one of the illusions that human
beings have created is what you call is "money

265
00:22:45,742 --> 00:22:51,962
maya" and, in that, comes also the wealth,
possessions, materialism.

266
00:22:51,962 --> 00:23:00,852
Everything is created by human beings, and
this creation of materialism then boils you

267
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:10,322
down to a personality which is involved in
all sinful act.

268
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:14,952
Everything is all right because if money is
all right, materialism is all right.

269
00:23:14,952 --> 00:23:24,272
For example, the way people went down to America
- Spanish - and killed so many aboriginals

270
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:25,272
there.

271
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:31,482
Then also English went and all kinds of people
went there in America.

272
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:38,692
The way they have tortured is something, is
you cannot think how human beings can behave

273
00:23:38,692 --> 00:23:48,562
like this towards ordinary people, who are
just simple people living in the jungles.

274
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:56,632
How can you do such a thing to them, such
horrible, you can call it a genocide?

275
00:23:56,632 --> 00:24:00,502
It's really a terrible thing, they did it.

276
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:07,092
We know more about these Germans, the way
they behaved recently, but even in those days

277
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:09,662
they used to do all kinds of things.

278
00:24:09,662 --> 00:24:15,052
And the nature, which is a Maya of God, which
how it takes respite.

279
00:24:15,052 --> 00:24:22,932
There were people in America, Central America,
near River Mississippi in Missouri.

280
00:24:22,932 --> 00:24:25,842
They're called as rednecks long time.

281
00:24:25,842 --> 00:24:28,462
He must be remembering this.

282
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:34,212
And because they were called rednecks by the
blacks, they used to kill so many blacks,

283
00:24:34,212 --> 00:24:40,412
they used to hang their children on the tree,
they used to throw their bodies in the river,

284
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:48,192
sometimes get them drowned; did all kinds
of things to the black people, under the name

285
00:24:48,192 --> 00:24:53,922
that they were white people and they're superior
and something like that, behaving worse than

286
00:24:53,922 --> 00:24:55,452
animals.

287
00:24:55,452 --> 00:25:04,722
Now you know, there, floods came in, terrible
floods came in and those floods drowned these

288
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:10,592
rednecks beyond their necks and so many were
dead.

289
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,182
One would say that "How could it happen?"

290
00:25:13,182 --> 00:25:14,182
It is.

291
00:25:14,182 --> 00:25:21,122
Another example I'll give you is the, you
see, the way Americans were treating all these

292
00:25:21,122 --> 00:25:29,392
Bolivians and the Colombians, that they would
buy everything from them very cheaply, and

293
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:32,442
like wheat and everything, very cheap.

294
00:25:32,442 --> 00:25:38,832
Just the minimum profits they had, and they
would sell it at a double price and make money.

295
00:25:38,832 --> 00:25:47,642
All this was really criminal to do from any
point of view, but they were doing it.

296
00:25:47,642 --> 00:25:56,042
I went to - I don't know what year it was,
1978 or so - into Colombia and there was one

297
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:57,212
man came in the party.

298
00:25:57,212 --> 00:25:58,212
I was with My husband.

299
00:25:58,212 --> 00:26:02,252
He said, "I've heard You are a great, saintly
person from India.

300
00:26:02,252 --> 00:26:08,262
Can You give us some blessings that we really
hit these Americans nicely and see them off?

301
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:15,862
Because the way they are exposing us to our
poverty and things, they're horrible."

302
00:26:15,862 --> 00:26:19,512
I said, "Why do you want to hit them?"

303
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:21,442
"No, they require it, otherwise they'll not
be all right."

304
00:26:21,442 --> 00:26:22,612
I was just in the party.

305
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:24,252
I didn't want to discuss it.

306
00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:25,252
"All right."

307
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:30,792
And, you know, this cocaine came up there.

308
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:35,852
And if you go and see now that place - I've
been to, Bogota, with My husband - it was

309
00:26:35,852 --> 00:26:41,922
like a shanty town, absolutely like a shanty
town, made of tin and this and that.

310
00:26:41,922 --> 00:26:46,702
Now, big, big buildings are there, and you
have escalators and everything.

311
00:26:46,702 --> 00:26:51,522
They used to bring petroleum with the donkey's
cart.

312
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:53,702
Can you imagine?

313
00:26:53,702 --> 00:27:00,172
In such a short time it has become such a
big country and not only that, but now the

314
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:05,492
whole America is afraid of them, even Australia.

315
00:27:05,492 --> 00:27:09,942
The drugs are taken by Americans themselves.

316
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:18,052
In Washington there is such a lot of storage
of drugs that they don't know what to do,

317
00:27:18,052 --> 00:27:20,682
and even the senators are taking to drugs.

318
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:21,682
Can you imagine?

319
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:26,712
I wouldn't be surprised one day Mr. Clinton
lands up with some drugs.

320
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:31,572
The way it is such a fashion, it is such a
fantastic thing for them.

321
00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:36,932
You go to any party of elite people, which
I have to some time, they only talk about

322
00:27:36,932 --> 00:27:37,932
drugs, you see.

323
00:27:37,932 --> 00:27:38,932
"You want?

324
00:27:38,932 --> 00:27:40,612
Which drug do you like?"

325
00:27:40,612 --> 00:27:42,372
I said, "I don't like any drug."

326
00:27:42,372 --> 00:27:43,372
"No.

327
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:46,422
If you want, you can get it cheaply in this,
you know, if you go there and get it there."

328
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:48,382
They discuss it in the elite parties.

329
00:27:48,382 --> 00:27:53,282
Also about gurus, you see, which guru you
want.

330
00:27:53,282 --> 00:27:56,112
"There is a sale on of a such-and-such guru.

331
00:27:56,112 --> 00:27:58,132
On a bargain you can go."

332
00:27:58,132 --> 00:27:59,132
Like that.

333
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:01,312
You know, it's all so stupid, I tell you.

334
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:05,202
I said, "These people are so immature, worse
than children."

335
00:28:05,202 --> 00:28:08,662
They are not grown up, only in age.

336
00:28:08,662 --> 00:28:16,082
They have done good maybe in mechanism and
all those things, but that has nothing to

337
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:24,482
do with your personality growth, and that's
why I find them just like dwarves the way

338
00:28:24,482 --> 00:28:27,022
they have attitude towards things.

339
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:35,442
And everyone practically must have taken drugs,
everybody except for Asians may not have,

340
00:28:35,442 --> 00:28:41,342
because now I have learnt that there are two
genes which protect the Asians, but the white

341
00:28:41,342 --> 00:28:43,632
skin has not those genes which are to protect.

342
00:28:43,632 --> 00:28:49,462
The other day in the lecture I told them that
there are two genes which are protective,

343
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:52,812
found only among Asians, means Chinese and
Indians.

344
00:28:52,812 --> 00:28:57,432
All the rest of the people don't have those
genes, which should protect them.

345
00:28:57,432 --> 00:29:03,832
So they are so vulnerable to all these nonsensical
things that are going on, and they take to

346
00:29:03,832 --> 00:29:04,832
it so easily.

347
00:29:04,832 --> 00:29:10,352
I used to wonder how these educated, good
people, I mean people of My husband's ranking

348
00:29:10,352 --> 00:29:12,732
also were stupid like that.

349
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:14,862
Every time they would bring a new wife.

350
00:29:14,862 --> 00:29:20,902
One day they brought, one of them, brought
a wife who was hardly about twenty years of

351
00:29:20,902 --> 00:29:21,902
age.

352
00:29:21,902 --> 00:29:23,492
This fellow is at least seventy.

353
00:29:23,492 --> 00:29:24,492
I didn't know.

354
00:29:24,492 --> 00:29:25,492
My husband pinched Me.

355
00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:27,592
He said, "That's his wife.

356
00:29:27,592 --> 00:29:28,592
All right?

357
00:29:28,592 --> 00:29:30,572
Don't call her a grand-daughter."

358
00:29:30,572 --> 00:29:36,042
I used to drop bricks after bricks there.

359
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:41,532
Such absurd people coming, and a seventy-year-old
man coming with a lady who's twenty years.

360
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:45,942
I mean, you can never think that she could
be his wife.

361
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:50,312
At the most a sister-in-law, at the most,
but I thought she was the grand-daughter so

362
00:29:50,312 --> 00:29:52,042
he pinched Me and told Me that "Don't."

363
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,422
This is it, you see.

364
00:29:54,422 --> 00:30:00,162
It's such a paradoxical world that if you
come from Sahaj to this, you see "What's going

365
00:30:00,162 --> 00:30:01,162
on?

366
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:02,162
What are they doing?

367
00:30:02,162 --> 00:30:04,052
What's the matter with them?"

368
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:09,542
Now, taking out clothes, is it something great
to take out clothes, you see?

369
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:16,452
In Switzerland, which is such a cold country,
I was wearing My sweater, My coat, covering

370
00:30:16,452 --> 00:30:22,982
My head, wearing warm socks, everything because
they said, "Let's go out for, just for a drive."

371
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:25,962
So, we got down.

372
00:30:25,962 --> 00:30:29,692
There's one lake called Lausanne.

373
00:30:29,692 --> 00:30:31,092
Lausanne, there's a very big lake.

374
00:30:31,092 --> 00:30:33,902
So, as usual, Gregoire ran up to see how is
the situation there.

375
00:30:33,902 --> 00:30:35,352
He came back with a double speed.

376
00:30:35,352 --> 00:30:37,452
He said, "No, no, Mother, You can't go there."

377
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:38,452
I said, "Why?"

378
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:39,452
"No.

379
00:30:39,452 --> 00:30:40,452
You can't.

380
00:30:40,452 --> 00:30:41,452
I am sorry.

381
00:30:41,452 --> 00:30:42,452
You can't.

382
00:30:42,452 --> 00:30:43,452
Let's go."

383
00:30:43,452 --> 00:30:44,782
They were all topless women sitting there.

384
00:30:44,782 --> 00:30:51,462
You know, this - in Australia they had, and
even New Zealand, they had cricket match.

385
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:55,622
They're supposed to be very good cricketers.

386
00:30:55,622 --> 00:30:58,492
And when we opened the TV, the women were
sitting topless.

387
00:30:58,492 --> 00:30:59,912
We closed it.

388
00:30:59,912 --> 00:31:04,442
We couldn't see that, but I was told now they're
losing in cricket.

389
00:31:04,442 --> 00:31:11,282
They will, definitely, compared to Indian
spinners, who are young innocent boys, you

390
00:31:11,282 --> 00:31:13,342
see - very young, twenty, twenty-one.

391
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:18,102
They have to be because there's no innocence,
there's no chastity, there's no respect.

392
00:31:18,102 --> 00:31:19,962
The women are sitting topless.

393
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,192
How can they win?

394
00:31:21,192 --> 00:31:23,592
They're insulting the Goddess there only.

395
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:24,692
How can they win?

396
00:31:24,692 --> 00:31:29,852
They cannot win, and a game like cricket is
something sensible.

397
00:31:29,852 --> 00:31:36,382
Even, I don't know, in any game if they can
win, because if this - distract the attention

398
00:31:36,382 --> 00:31:37,382
completely.

399
00:31:37,382 --> 00:31:39,962
But why do they go like that?

400
00:31:39,962 --> 00:31:43,552
Are all women trying to become prostitutes?

401
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:45,412
What is the sense in it?

402
00:31:45,412 --> 00:31:47,832
I can't understand.

403
00:31:47,832 --> 00:31:49,932
And this is something they don't understand.

404
00:31:49,932 --> 00:31:55,582
If you tell them that, "You see, I was told
that Mrs. Thatcher openly said that in this

405
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:59,972
culture women must expose their body."

406
00:31:59,972 --> 00:32:02,052
There's such a paradox.

407
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:03,422
Can't understand.

408
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:09,692
They show here Mother Mary as the sublime
personality, and they show here women as the

409
00:32:09,692 --> 00:32:12,672
- women who are nude.

410
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:17,652
They want to become Mother Mary or what do
they want to become?

411
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:22,932
And people like this, horrible people like
this Michael Jackson - he is that - are so

412
00:32:22,932 --> 00:32:24,762
prominent making money.

413
00:32:24,762 --> 00:32:26,492
I mean, just see the paradox.

414
00:32:26,492 --> 00:32:37,192
Can you say that this is an advanced country
when the ideas are so, so low?

415
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:41,172
How can it be?

416
00:32:41,172 --> 00:32:48,872
After coming to Sahaja Yoga, you can see for
yourself, but it makes your, these protective

417
00:32:48,872 --> 00:32:50,392
genes established in you.

418
00:32:50,392 --> 00:32:53,122
This is the thing in Sahaj Yoga.

419
00:32:53,122 --> 00:32:55,552
And suddenly, you people have given up all
that nonsense.

420
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,802
You don't want all that now.

421
00:32:57,802 --> 00:33:05,452
Actually, if you see it properly from any
logical point of view, you see, without the

422
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:10,945
Maya of this nonsense - if you see it, you
can logically understand that it is wrong.

423
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:17,012
You see, why do you feel jealous of another
man or woman?

424
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:18,351
You feel jealous.

425
00:33:18,351 --> 00:33:21,922
That means you want just life, isn't it?

426
00:33:21,922 --> 00:33:28,222
People have murdered, women have murdered
men or women because they were jealous.

427
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:36,382
If it was natural and normal and joy giving,
you should not have felt bad about it.

428
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:41,462
All these things should logically be understood
that, why we don't like this happening.

429
00:33:41,462 --> 00:33:44,332
Or this happens to your own daughter, you
may not like.

430
00:33:44,332 --> 00:33:48,952
Nowadays there are people who like it, also,
to the daughters.

431
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:55,052
But - now going to that limit of things, like
there's one person, say, he has something

432
00:33:55,052 --> 00:33:59,802
to do with the daughter and the whole society's
against it, today.

433
00:33:59,802 --> 00:34:07,622
But maybe tomorrow, with this Maya, this horrible
devil-maya, which is anti-maya, will work

434
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:11,572
out and maybe that nobody will mind it.

435
00:34:11,572 --> 00:34:13,192
It may be.

436
00:34:13,192 --> 00:34:21,692
If you people do not hold it right into your
hands, the culture side of Sahaj, I don't

437
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:22,942
know what's going to happen.

438
00:34:22,942 --> 00:34:27,422
If you read newspaper every day, you feel
really dizzy, you don't understand in what

439
00:34:27,422 --> 00:34:29,471
Maya these people are lost.

440
00:34:29,471 --> 00:34:31,632
So it's an anti-maya.

441
00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:35,372
Because Mahamaya has come, so anti-maya has
come.

442
00:34:35,372 --> 00:34:40,572
Fifty years back or sixty years back, it was
not that bad, I can tell you.

443
00:34:40,572 --> 00:34:46,052
Once in a while people used to do something
nonsensical, but now it is rampant.

444
00:34:46,052 --> 00:34:48,612
But it now has become a fashion.

445
00:34:48,612 --> 00:34:54,592
It's worse than that, is that accepted as
a fashion, and if you're not in it, you're

446
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,592
out.

447
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:59,722
You have to be in the madhouse.

448
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:05,012
You should see this clearly because now you
have come into the Maya of God.

449
00:35:05,012 --> 00:35:12,362
"Maya" also means love, the God's love, and,
in that, your eyes should open out and see:

450
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:15,032
what horrible things this they are doing?

451
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:16,032
What is this disco?

452
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:21,822
You know, in India they brought the disco
and, of course, some boys who were Muslims

453
00:35:21,822 --> 00:35:29,622
actually were rich and they carried young
girls, because in disco the law was that you

454
00:35:29,622 --> 00:35:35,902
must bring your partner - young girls who
were adults, maybe not be adults also, and

455
00:35:35,902 --> 00:35:41,782
started giving them alcohol, drinking and
they got lost.

456
00:35:41,782 --> 00:35:43,142
The parents wouldn't accept them.

457
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:48,832
They had to go to brothels or they were sold
out or I don't know what happened to them.

458
00:35:48,832 --> 00:35:51,112
But that is the reaction in that country.

459
00:35:51,112 --> 00:35:53,422
It may be one day they'll be accepted.

460
00:35:53,422 --> 00:35:59,372
One day we'll have the same thing because
it has such a overpowering effect, and that's

461
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:02,142
why the Maya of God is such.

462
00:36:02,142 --> 00:36:09,462
This, all these beautiful things are there
so you can get lost with it, you can see it,

463
00:36:09,462 --> 00:36:11,952
you can picture it, you can paint it.

464
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:14,292
But no, they are not - they're not interested.

465
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:16,012
They'll make this also ugly.

466
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:17,612
They'll make every picture ugly.

467
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:20,072
They'll make every face ugly.

468
00:36:20,072 --> 00:36:26,282
So this is the anti-maya that is there and,
for that, you need a Mahamaya to correct it

469
00:36:26,282 --> 00:36:29,202
and to solve the problem.

470
00:36:29,202 --> 00:36:34,822
The complete working of the Divine depends
on you people, wherever you are.

471
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:43,802
How many you are is not the point - wherever
you are, how intense you are, how you want

472
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:50,922
to work it out, how you want to put your attention
to.

473
00:36:50,922 --> 00:36:58,461
It's very important how you are going to do,
it because you people should understand the

474
00:36:58,461 --> 00:36:59,461
responsibility.

475
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:06,401
This world is getting drowned, and I feel
that at least eighty percent people will be

476
00:37:06,401 --> 00:37:07,881
finished.

477
00:37:07,881 --> 00:37:14,492
Ten would be hanging in between in limbo I
think, really, and ten percent will be Sahaja

478
00:37:14,492 --> 00:37:16,811
Yogis, the way it is moving in the West.

479
00:37:16,811 --> 00:37:18,731
Maybe in India may not be.

480
00:37:18,731 --> 00:37:19,731
I can't say.

481
00:37:19,731 --> 00:37:22,092
India is very fast-moving Sahaja Yoga.

482
00:37:22,092 --> 00:37:27,201
Also Russia and all these Eastern Bloc people
are just jumping into it.

483
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:30,321
I don't know how they have discovered Me so
easily.

484
00:37:30,321 --> 00:37:31,542
They say My Face is evident.

485
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:39,431
I don't know what makes them think.

486
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:42,702
The another Maya is of power.

487
00:37:42,702 --> 00:37:49,692
And the power of money if they can avoid,
then they try to have power over territory,

488
00:37:49,692 --> 00:37:52,452
of the land, this, that.

489
00:37:52,452 --> 00:37:57,772
That also made them mad quite a lot in the
past, but now they're all fighting for some

490
00:37:57,772 --> 00:38:00,802
nonsensical land, which will never belong
to them.

491
00:38:00,802 --> 00:38:05,282
It stays here permanently, eternally, but
the fights are going on.

492
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:11,341
Then, in the name of religion, they're fighting
for this area, that area or they're fighting

493
00:38:11,341 --> 00:38:19,341
for, say, just for changing their religion
or getting more people in that religion.

494
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:23,052
I don't know what is their idea of religion
is.

495
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:24,962
Is religion meant for that?

496
00:38:24,962 --> 00:38:26,372
Just think of it.

497
00:38:26,372 --> 00:38:27,952
Nobody thinks like that.

498
00:38:27,952 --> 00:38:30,472
What is it meant for?

499
00:38:30,472 --> 00:38:36,592
So here, again, the Mahamaya has to work and
the Mahamaya works this way, that She integrates

500
00:38:36,592 --> 00:38:38,121
all the religions.

501
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:43,671
She shows that all religions are the same,
have the same spirituality.

502
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:48,851
It's on the same tree of spirituality, they
have grown.

503
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:53,022
Instead of making people spiritual, they have
made them money-oriented or they have made

504
00:38:53,022 --> 00:38:56,042
them power-oriented.

505
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,022
I mean it's the other way round.

506
00:38:58,022 --> 00:39:06,161
It's like the tree growing underneath or something,
something absurd that you cannot explain and

507
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:09,052
that is the thing is that illusive.

508
00:39:09,052 --> 00:39:10,732
That illusiveness is called Maya.

509
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:17,192
And this illusiveness appeals to many people.

510
00:39:17,192 --> 00:39:19,911
Appeals - that's the point I'm worried about.

511
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:27,061
Something is illusive, then they go on running
after that like a mirage and ultimately they

512
00:39:27,061 --> 00:39:28,061
are destroyed.

513
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:35,712
So what you see, a picture just now, is that
at least so many - ten percent people - will

514
00:39:35,712 --> 00:39:37,782
be saved, at the most.

515
00:39:37,782 --> 00:39:43,851
But this is a very sad affair because it has
taken so much effort to make human beings,

516
00:39:43,851 --> 00:39:49,571
to make them all right, to make them sensible
and now what you find is that they are going

517
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:50,811
to be all finished.

518
00:39:50,811 --> 00:39:57,032
It's too much to bear, too much to believe
in, but it is going to happen, if you people

519
00:39:57,032 --> 00:39:59,962
do not take it up seriously and work it out.

520
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:05,762
For you, also, there should not be any illusions
because many of you are more busy with other

521
00:40:05,762 --> 00:40:06,762
things.

522
00:40:06,762 --> 00:40:09,611
To you other things are more important than
Sahaja Yoga.

523
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:13,042
But whatever you are doing, you can bring
in Sahaja Yoga into that.

524
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:15,782
Into anything you can bring in Sahaja Yoga.

525
00:40:15,782 --> 00:40:21,452
I said in politics, in agriculture, in social
life, in your jobs, everywhere you can bring

526
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:22,452
Sahaja Yoga.

527
00:40:22,452 --> 00:40:30,331
By your own behavior, by your own intelligence,
you can bring in Sahaja Yoga into every field,

528
00:40:30,331 --> 00:40:33,611
which you have to think about, "Where can
we take Sahaj Yoga?

529
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:34,962
Where can we work it out?"

530
00:40:34,962 --> 00:40:43,952
And this is what is to get into the Maya of
God, that you get rid of all the illusions

531
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:49,322
which are false, which do not allow you to
see the right thing, and then seriously to

532
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,632
get into the productive side of Sahaja Yoga.

533
00:40:52,632 --> 00:40:59,022
Can you imagine how productive is Sahaja Yoga,
how the miracles work out, how there is this

534
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:03,842
Divine Power is anxious to help, despite all
this Mahamaya and all that.

535
00:41:03,842 --> 00:41:11,252
I'll give you the example of My grandson now
because this time we had a big Maya on him.

536
00:41:11,252 --> 00:41:15,592
He was - I told him that, "You should not
go to Cambridge, you know."

537
00:41:15,592 --> 00:41:19,762
I said, "They don't give admissions normally
and, moreover, it's more sort of theoretical

538
00:41:19,762 --> 00:41:22,052
things, not actually good for you.

539
00:41:22,052 --> 00:41:24,942
You'll be bored stupid there, so don't go."

540
00:41:24,942 --> 00:41:26,312
He wouldn't listen to Me.

541
00:41:26,312 --> 00:41:30,702
Then he agreed, "All right, if I get admission
in these, these big universities in America

542
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:31,702
I'll go."

543
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:32,802
But he didn't try.

544
00:41:32,802 --> 00:41:33,802
Nothing of the kind.

545
00:41:33,802 --> 00:41:39,782
Last minute we sent him a application and
he sent that application.

546
00:41:39,782 --> 00:41:40,982
Last minute.

547
00:41:40,982 --> 00:41:43,342
They said, "You cannot come.

548
00:41:43,342 --> 00:41:44,342
This is that.

549
00:41:44,342 --> 00:41:50,552
You have to prepare for this exam, SAT exam,
that exam", and then he got a fright.

550
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:51,552
You see, which he learnt.

551
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:53,831
"My God, I thought so easy to go to America.

552
00:41:53,831 --> 00:41:55,482
It is not."

553
00:41:55,482 --> 00:41:57,972
Even if you certify money it is not easy.

554
00:41:57,972 --> 00:42:03,182
Then he started thinking that "What was I
thinking about Cambridge, Cambridge so much?

555
00:42:03,182 --> 00:42:06,732
This is the same, equally the same difficult
thing.

556
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:13,212
" Until then he wanted to go for SAT, there
to sit for an exam, but actually the appearing

557
00:42:13,212 --> 00:42:18,532
of the examination was only after six days
and I thought, "How can he go?

558
00:42:18,532 --> 00:42:20,762
Six days he cannot prepare even."

559
00:42:20,762 --> 00:42:22,982
So they said, "You cannot come for SAT here."

560
00:42:22,982 --> 00:42:24,871
Now he was settled down in India.

561
00:42:24,871 --> 00:42:26,312
He didn't know what to do.

562
00:42:26,312 --> 00:42:30,512
Still he was saying, "I'll try for this Cambridge
again and this."

563
00:42:30,512 --> 00:42:32,202
I said, "Now, forget it."

564
00:42:32,202 --> 00:42:34,432
He wouldn't listen to Me.

565
00:42:34,432 --> 00:42:35,911
Then he was very disappointed.

566
00:42:35,911 --> 00:42:42,392
He telephoned to Me to say that "I think that
if I have to go to America, I'll go in a good

567
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:43,392
university.

568
00:42:43,392 --> 00:42:48,571
Otherwise, no use going to a cheap university;
I can get better education in India."

569
00:42:48,571 --> 00:42:49,571
So I said, "All right."

570
00:42:49,571 --> 00:42:53,512
Then I gave a bandhan because he wanted to
go abroad and learn something.

571
00:42:53,512 --> 00:42:54,512
It's all right.

572
00:42:54,512 --> 00:42:58,532
Can you imagine, it has worked like a real
miracle.

573
00:42:58,532 --> 00:43:03,722
The university wrote to him that he is admitted
unconditionally.

574
00:43:03,722 --> 00:43:04,762
Nobody did anything.

575
00:43:04,762 --> 00:43:07,292
Nobody wrote anything.

576
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:08,562
Nothing.

577
00:43:08,562 --> 00:43:09,562
They have said it.

578
00:43:09,562 --> 00:43:14,671
None of them can understand what has happened,
how did they get unconditional admission?

579
00:43:14,671 --> 00:43:20,492
So, you see, it's a miracle, but before that
this Maya was to be played, otherwise he would

580
00:43:20,492 --> 00:43:23,621
never have seen the importance of it.

581
00:43:23,621 --> 00:43:26,101
So, in your lives also, such a Maya plays.

582
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:28,282
When you do not want to do the right thing.

583
00:43:28,282 --> 00:43:29,821
All right, do it.

584
00:43:29,821 --> 00:43:30,982
You do this.

585
00:43:30,982 --> 00:43:32,522
All right, do that.

586
00:43:32,522 --> 00:43:33,522
Do that.

587
00:43:33,522 --> 00:43:35,232
Ultimately, you learn a lesson.

588
00:43:35,232 --> 00:43:37,561
I don't say no, if you say, "Mother, I want
to do it."

589
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:38,561
"All right, go ahead."

590
00:43:38,561 --> 00:43:39,561
"I want to do that."

591
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:42,062
"Oh, go ahead, whatever you want to do."

592
00:43:42,062 --> 00:43:46,972
If I find you congenial, I may tell you that
"Better not do, it's not going to help you."

593
00:43:46,972 --> 00:43:54,752
But then they,when they get a complete disillusionment,
then they take to the right decision, come

594
00:43:54,752 --> 00:44:01,022
to the right thing because, see, let them
try with their own freedom, but then they

595
00:44:01,022 --> 00:44:02,811
realize that, "What Mother said was right.

596
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:04,401
I should have done that.

597
00:44:04,401 --> 00:44:05,502
All right."

598
00:44:05,502 --> 00:44:06,722
So this is it.

599
00:44:06,722 --> 00:44:11,743
The Maya is like this, that it allows you
to do what you like.

600
00:44:11,743 --> 00:44:13,292
You use your freedom.

601
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:14,532
You go places to places.

602
00:44:14,532 --> 00:44:16,762
Do what you want to do.

603
00:44:16,762 --> 00:44:18,462
Whatever you think it proper, you do it.

604
00:44:18,462 --> 00:44:25,222
All right, this is a part of the Maya, but
Mahamaya is that which brings you back, brings

605
00:44:25,222 --> 00:44:32,272
you back to normal, brings you back to reality,
to understand.

606
00:44:32,272 --> 00:44:35,952
It is at that point when you understand Mahamaya.

607
00:44:35,952 --> 00:44:38,601
Like I would say Russians did.

608
00:44:38,601 --> 00:44:44,042
How they understood that I'm doing greater
work than Einstein?

609
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:46,881
"See, what is Einstein?

610
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:49,542
He is just working with the matter.

611
00:44:49,542 --> 00:44:52,901
You are working with human beings, do You
realize, Mother."

612
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:58,332
To them I am higher than all of them, greater
than all of them, which is a fact also, I

613
00:44:58,332 --> 00:44:59,332
must say.

614
00:44:59,332 --> 00:45:06,142
It's fact in a way that the way work is done,
but doesn't mean that it's something to be

615
00:45:06,142 --> 00:45:09,581
ego about it, because if I am made like that,
I am doing it.

616
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:10,581
What is so special?

617
00:45:10,581 --> 00:45:14,182
I've been like this, so I'm like that.

618
00:45:14,182 --> 00:45:15,762
What is so special?

619
00:45:15,762 --> 00:45:20,242
One gets the pride and the ego only when you
think you are doing something more beyond

620
00:45:20,242 --> 00:45:21,242
you.

621
00:45:21,242 --> 00:45:22,242
You see, it's all there.

622
00:45:22,242 --> 00:45:23,242
I've already got it.

623
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:25,391
Now, see this tent is meant to give shade.

624
00:45:25,391 --> 00:45:30,851
Now if it is giving shade, should it have
ego?

625
00:45:30,851 --> 00:45:32,661
Sun is meant to give you light.

626
00:45:32,661 --> 00:45:37,891
If it is giving light, it's giving light because
God has given him the light to be given, so

627
00:45:37,891 --> 00:45:39,311
he's giving light to you.

628
00:45:39,311 --> 00:45:40,801
Should he have ego?

629
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:48,542
But you'll be, you see, assume that you have
got something special about you, then you

630
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:50,421
have to do that, whatever special you have.

631
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:54,242
Now, the flowers are so beautiful, they're
so special, so charming.

632
00:45:54,242 --> 00:45:57,592
I mean, I couldn't take out My attention from
them, they're so beautiful.

633
00:45:57,592 --> 00:46:00,702
All right, but if they are so, they are so.

634
00:46:00,702 --> 00:46:01,812
What is there?

635
00:46:01,812 --> 00:46:07,042
They're not going to have ego about it, that
"We are so good, we are so beautiful."

636
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:10,262
No, none of that.

637
00:46:10,262 --> 00:46:17,601
So this ego comes when there is again the
Mahamaya part of it, that you are in the Maya

638
00:46:17,601 --> 00:46:21,341
of your own understanding.

639
00:46:21,341 --> 00:46:23,831
Now you're Sahaja Yogis.

640
00:46:23,831 --> 00:46:24,962
You should be very proud.

641
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:28,452
You should be, I don't know.

642
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:35,012
Look at these horrible people who are not
at all connected with God.

643
00:46:35,012 --> 00:46:36,212
They have nothing to do.

644
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:42,331
Yesterday that lady, she gives Me a lecture
that "Why don't you praise the Lord?," you

645
00:46:42,331 --> 00:46:43,331
see.

646
00:46:43,331 --> 00:46:45,032
She's giving Me a lecture.

647
00:46:45,032 --> 00:46:52,432
So it is just a sort of a assumption that
"I am something great" that makes you ego,

648
00:46:52,432 --> 00:46:57,012
but that is also a Maya, because you have
to learn.

649
00:46:57,012 --> 00:47:05,432
Ultimately, your ego breaks and you understand
that "Oh, a Humpty-Dumpty it was."

650
00:47:05,432 --> 00:47:08,992
Once you discover that, "I don't want to have
an ego any more."

651
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,752
I mean there are some Sahaja Yogis who refuse
to do any work of Sahaja Yoga.

652
00:47:12,752 --> 00:47:13,752
I said, "Why?"

653
00:47:13,752 --> 00:47:18,372
"Mother, we are too intelligent and our intelligence
cheats us and we'll develop ego."

654
00:47:18,372 --> 00:47:21,002
I said, "Now this is an escape.

655
00:47:21,002 --> 00:47:27,442
It won't, Sahaja Yoga can never give you ego,
but will give you joy.

656
00:47:27,442 --> 00:47:29,442
If it is giving you ego, it's not Sahaj.

657
00:47:29,442 --> 00:47:31,671
It should just give you joy.

658
00:47:31,671 --> 00:47:37,421
Giving somebody to Realization or somebody
you're curing, somebody being kind, anything,

659
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,641
it just gives you satisfaction and you enjoy.

660
00:47:39,641 --> 00:47:40,641
It's a fact.

661
00:47:40,641 --> 00:47:45,562
I mean, you have come all the way here, you
are playing such good music, all this.

662
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:48,702
Now you learnt Indian style, I don't know
how.

663
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:50,712
Anybody should be very full of ego.

664
00:47:50,712 --> 00:47:54,462
But no, in the Maya of your Mother, you just
enjoy.

665
00:47:54,462 --> 00:47:56,982
Maya should give you enjoyment.

666
00:47:56,982 --> 00:48:03,492
That's the best thing that this Maya can give,
and you can enjoy it so much.

667
00:48:03,492 --> 00:48:16,831
I think it is a very beautiful atmosphere
created by this Mahamaya.

668
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:21,381
So you can enjoy each other, you can enjoy
My company, you can enjoy nature.

669
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:28,591
Such a rapport, such a beautiful understanding
between everything else is there.

670
00:48:28,591 --> 00:48:34,322
Nobody is bothered as to who is higher, who
is lower, what is the position; how much money

671
00:48:34,322 --> 00:48:37,062
he has got or what he has got.

672
00:48:37,062 --> 00:48:38,732
Nothing, just you're all enjoying.

673
00:48:38,732 --> 00:48:44,932
If somebody has a talent, he enjoys because
he has a talent and the others also enjoy

674
00:48:44,932 --> 00:48:46,962
because he has talent.

675
00:48:46,962 --> 00:48:49,492
No jealousies, no rivalries, nothing.

676
00:48:49,492 --> 00:48:50,752
Somebody sings better, all right.

677
00:48:50,752 --> 00:48:53,901
They'll tell Me, "Mother, You know, he sings
very well."

678
00:48:53,901 --> 00:49:03,661
There's one fellow in Paris and he is, I think
he's a black, from the black side, because

679
00:49:03,661 --> 00:49:08,212
he has very curly hair, a very nice boy.

680
00:49:08,212 --> 00:49:11,542
So, suddenly, somebody came from Italy.

681
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:13,581
"Mother, do You know he dances very well?"

682
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:14,581
"How do you know?"

683
00:49:14,581 --> 00:49:15,581
"I've seen him dancing."

684
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:17,881
"So when did you see me dancing?" he asked.

685
00:49:17,881 --> 00:49:20,612
"You know, you came to that program.

686
00:49:20,612 --> 00:49:21,612
I saw that."

687
00:49:21,612 --> 00:49:22,782
In a group he saw him.

688
00:49:22,782 --> 00:49:25,321
He just got hold of him, "You'd better dance
before Mother."

689
00:49:25,321 --> 00:49:29,582
It was so much, you see, so joy-giving, this
kind of thing.

690
00:49:29,582 --> 00:49:37,301
He saw him in some sort of a program where
they were at least two thousand people dancing.

691
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:39,232
He picked him out.

692
00:49:39,232 --> 00:49:45,641
Now, he's from Paris, and he's from Italy,
and how his eyes picked him up and he brought

693
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:46,641
him.

694
00:49:46,641 --> 00:49:47,641
"Mother.

695
00:49:47,641 --> 00:49:48,641
You'd better dance before Mother, must!

696
00:49:48,641 --> 00:49:49,782
You are very good."

697
00:49:49,782 --> 00:49:50,942
And he was.

698
00:49:50,942 --> 00:49:53,942
But you see I might have missed it or whatever
it is.

699
00:49:53,942 --> 00:49:56,551
And even if I'd seen it I may not have asked
him.

700
00:49:56,551 --> 00:50:01,111
But this fellow went down there, and he's
got hold of him and he out put him here.

701
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:04,472
I mean, these things are so joy-giving, you
see.

702
00:50:04,472 --> 00:50:12,032
It is otherwise, in the normal course, what
one would do, come before Me and start dancing,

703
00:50:12,032 --> 00:50:15,752
whether know or not and try to show off.

704
00:50:15,752 --> 00:50:16,752
Normally.

705
00:50:16,752 --> 00:50:22,442
But the one who knows never brought like that,
"Now, come along" and in such an impersonal

706
00:50:22,442 --> 00:50:25,222
way he saw him and brought him.

707
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:32,351
It makes no difference whether they're from
Russia, or from America, or from India.

708
00:50:32,351 --> 00:50:36,661
So all these differences which are skin deep
are finished.

709
00:50:36,661 --> 00:50:42,351
And I find everybody appreciates everybody's
talent, everybody, how he speaks and suddenly,

710
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:45,121
you'll find someone say, "Oh, he's such a
gem."

711
00:50:45,121 --> 00:50:46,682
"When did you meet him?"

712
00:50:46,682 --> 00:50:48,472
"No, I've heard about him."

713
00:50:48,472 --> 00:50:56,942
You see, all this appreciation and all this
beautiful feeling for others, you see, is

714
00:50:56,942 --> 00:50:58,242
only possible through Sahaj.

715
00:50:58,242 --> 00:51:00,661
No jealousies, no rivalries, nothing.

716
00:51:00,661 --> 00:51:06,372
These come because of an ignorance, which
creates the Maya about yourself, also: "I

717
00:51:06,372 --> 00:51:07,372
am this.

718
00:51:07,372 --> 00:51:08,881
I am that."

719
00:51:08,881 --> 00:51:12,252
And then the "I" comes down like that.

720
00:51:12,252 --> 00:51:16,522
So all conditionings also can create a Maya.

721
00:51:16,522 --> 00:51:20,651
Many conditionings are there that "I am from
such a family.

722
00:51:20,651 --> 00:51:22,352
I am from such a thing."

723
00:51:22,352 --> 00:51:24,182
That all has to be stopped.

724
00:51:24,182 --> 00:51:30,492
So today's special day is this of New Year's
where they said, "Now, today's the most auspicious

725
00:51:30,492 --> 00:51:36,551
day to start something new," and this Mahamaya's
dissolving has to be started.

726
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,621
Gradually, you should try to understand.

727
00:51:38,621 --> 00:51:42,321
Many people ask Me, "Mother, how did You do
it?"

728
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:43,321
Forget it.

729
00:51:43,321 --> 00:51:44,321
It's Mahamaya.

730
00:51:44,321 --> 00:51:45,321
Forget it.

731
00:51:45,321 --> 00:51:46,661
How did I do it?

732
00:51:46,661 --> 00:51:48,581
Just forget it.

733
00:51:48,581 --> 00:51:50,121
That part you need not go into.

734
00:51:50,121 --> 00:51:51,232
Just enjoy.

735
00:51:51,232 --> 00:51:55,671
Just enjoy that you are in that Maya and you
are enjoying it.

736
00:51:55,671 --> 00:51:59,492
It's the best way to enjoy this Mahamaya.

737
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:02,742
And today, for the first time, we have this
Puja of Mahamaya.

738
00:52:02,742 --> 00:52:08,802
Because of Gudipadwa, I thought something
unique must be done which encompasses everything

739
00:52:08,802 --> 00:52:11,871
of Sahaja Yoga, everything of Sahaja Yoga.

740
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:19,222
It's not one incarnation, it's not one nadi,
it's not one Goddess, but all of it is there.

741
00:52:19,222 --> 00:52:29,171
It's sometimes I say like a film is audio,
visual, everything is there - drama, music,

742
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:31,071
also acting.

743
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:32,752
Everything is there in a film now.

744
00:52:32,752 --> 00:52:36,222
I mean that far, everything integrated.

745
00:52:36,222 --> 00:52:45,992
In the same way, I think Mahamaya has everything
in it: every part that you tell Me, everything

746
00:52:45,992 --> 00:52:49,492
that you enjoy, everything that you discover.

747
00:52:49,492 --> 00:52:54,571
Everything is in that vision of Mahamaya,
which has been created for you.

748
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:55,212
May God bless you.
