1
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:08,130
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,110
Yesterday at the very outset,

3
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,080
I told you that truth is what it is.

4
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,190
If we have not found the truth

5
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,120
we should be humble and honest about it,

6
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,010
because truth is for our benevolence,

7
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,170
for the benevolence of our city,

8
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,120
of our society,

9
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,180
of our country and of the whole universe.

10
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:50,070
This is a very special time you are all born,

11
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:56,210
where people have to get their Self-realization.

12
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,170
This is the Resurrection Time as described in the Bible,

13
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,220
it's the time of Kiyama as described by Mohammed Sahib.

14
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,120
This is a very special time when Nala,

15
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,000
as you know, Nala damayanthi akhyan -

16
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,170
Nala was faced with Kali.

17
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,070
He got very angry with Kali and said that

18
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,120
"You have destroyed my family, you have destroyed my peace,

19
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,120
and you put people into bhram,

20
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,070
into illusions,

21
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,160
so I'd better kill you."

22
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,240
He challenged

23
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,220
Kali that "You should be finished forever."

24
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,140
Then Kali said, "All right, let me tell you my mahatmyam.

25
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,150
Let me tell you why I should be there.

26
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:01,040
If I convince you then you can stop killing me,

27
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,240
but if I do not, you can kill me."

28
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:11,010
So he told that "Today all those who are seeking the truth,

29
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,180
seeking their Self-realization, Atma sakshatkara,

30
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,110
those who are going into giri and kandharas,

31
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,240
into the mountains and in the valleys,

32
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,160
searching God all over the world;

33
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,240
these people will be born

34
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:32,060
as ordinary householders during Kali Yuga.

35
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,060
There will be bhram, no doubt,

36
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,110
people will be in sabhram.

37
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,120
Illusion will be there, and the confusion will be there

38
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,100
- that I will create, no doubt -

39
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,200
but because of this confusion only,

40
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:52,020
these simple householders will seek the truth.

41
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,110
And that's why

42
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,170
that is the time they will get their Atma sakshatkara."

43
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,040
It's a - lots of prophecies have been there

44
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,210
in our shastras about these times,

45
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,020
but specially

46
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,080
Bhrigumuni in "Nadigranth" has described about these times.

47
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,130
If you tally them with the timing of today,

48
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,120
it is exactly this time.

49
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,030
After the death of Raghwindra Swami this will happen,

50
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,210
and that's what is happening now.

51
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,090
For you people it is very important to understand that

52
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:44,130
Raghwindra Swami was in this area and he did a lot of work,

53
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,120
and now the time has come to complete his work;

54
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,000
also Ramana Maharshi.

55
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,070
They didn't know how to explain,

56
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,190
so they took to maunavart.

57
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,020
People like Gyaneshwara at the age of twenty-three,

58
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
writing such wonderful things,

59
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,170
like "Amruta anubhavi ..." is a book,

60
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,080
I think the last word on spirituality.

61
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,020
They had to get into samadhis at a such a young age of

62
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,220
twenty-three years,

63
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,090
because nobody tried to understand them.

64
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,230
So much of ritualism,

65
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,070
so much of conditioning,

66
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,030
so much of reading that nobody wanted to know

67
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,100
what they were talking.

68
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,020
Everybody thought, "We know everything,"

69
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,240
and that's how this kind of a satisfaction that they had.

70
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,140
Kabira has said,

71
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,060
Kaise samjhaun, sab jag andhaa -

72
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,190
"How am I to explain, the whole world is blind."

73
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,140
But this is what we have to achieve in our evolution,

74
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,200
this is what we have to jump into.

75
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,070
To become the spirit is told by all the scriptures -

76
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,090
not only India, everywhere.

77
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,020
If you take Tao, if you take Zen,

78
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:07,240
if you go to the Jewish or to the Christian philosophies,

79
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,220
or to the Islamic, everywhere it is said

80
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,100
that you have to become your Self,

81
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,190
you have to have self-knowledge.

82
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,110
Of course, anybody said like that,

83
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,140
those people who are in charge of religion

84
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,050
or at the helm of affairs, making money

85
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,200
or creating power out of it,

86
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,200
people using religion for power or money;

87
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,060
they didn't like it, so they said, "They are heretics.

88
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,200
This is blasphemy. They have no special knowledge."

89
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,180
And that's how they have been punishing people,

90
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,180
troubling people, torturing them.

91
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,000
But the time has come now for all the seekers

92
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,180
to get their Self-realization, Atma sakshatkara.

93
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,060
Yesterday I told you how it works out

94
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,060
through kundalini awakening.

95
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,020
About kundalini people have written

96
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,220
all kinds of nonsensical things which is not true.

97
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,070
I am your Mother, I'm going to tell you truth,

98
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm not going to tell you something false.

99
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,080
Even if you don't like it let Me tell you,

100
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,000
because this is for your benevolence,

101
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,200
for your good, for your hita.

102
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,230
So when the kundalini rises,

103
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,010
she passes through your

104
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,190
different centers which are subtle centers,

105
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,220
and nourishes them,

106
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,030
pierces through your fontanel bone area

107
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,000
and connects you to the all-pervading Power,

108
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,030
about which we do not know.

109
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,070
Then from your hands you feel vibrations,

110
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,240
which are called as Chaitanya lahari.

111
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,050
Adi Shankaracharya has called it "Saundarya lahari,"

112
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,080
because you can judge the saundarya with this.

113
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,140
Beautifully he has described it.

114
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,010
But how much they tortured him 

115
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,170
- think of it,

116
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,070
person like Adi Shankaracharya - I mean,

117
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,160
I don't know what to say.

118
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,050
The one who gave such secrets about the Mother,

119
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,090
such great descriptions;

120
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,190
he was tortured for what?

121
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,090
What wrong did he do that he should have been tortured?

122
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:34,010
Now we have to stand up with the truth,

123
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,120
and must say that "Mother, we have to have the truth,

124
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,150
and truth and nothing else."

125
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,160
I told you yesterday that Atma

126
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,080
is the reflection of God Almighty in our heart.

127
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,220
In these days of scientific

128
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,140
conditioning this is a new type, apart from the "dharmic"

129
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,210
scientific conditioning in which every scientist thinks

130
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,000
that he knows everything.

131
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,190
They don't know anything, take it from Me.

132
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,130
It's absurd.

133
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,010
Now you have seen so many scientists

134
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,230
coming up and telling you about Sahaja Yoga.

135
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,170
They have accepted because they have experimented.

136
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,090
I told them that Mooladhara Chakra,

137
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,120
the first chakra, Mooladhara,

138
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,070
is made of carbon atoms,

139
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,160
because it is made of Prithvi (means earth)... tattwa.

140
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,220
And if you photograph the carbon atom

141
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,060
and make a model out of it

142
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,050
and then take a photograph, say, from left side,

143
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,040
you'll see the right side,

144
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,160
and you'll see actually "Aum" written down.

145
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,160
If you see it from the right side,

146
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,160
on the left side you will see a swastika.

147
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,080
But if you see from down upward,

148
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,150
you will see a cross.

149
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,130
There is, really I must tell you a Dr. Worlikar

150
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,240
who is a very famous doctor,

151
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:12,050
he missed his prize in the Nobel Prize because,

152
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,220
perhaps, he was an Indian.

153
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,100
He's the one who experimented with three,

154
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,030
four other Sahaja yogi scientists, and they said it is so.

155
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,100
It is so.

156
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
There is such a little knowledge with these scientists,

157
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,220
because they are seeing things from outside.

158
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,150
With Sahaja Yoga you go from inside.

159
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,070
And everybody says the same thing,

160
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,020
because - now you see Me standing here

161
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,210
wearing a white sari and a red border;

162
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,180
everybody knows, everybody feels.

163
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,210
I don't have to tell you, you know it,

164
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,210
you see it and you see this is so.

165
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,240
But once you get your realization,

166
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,110
whatever you feel on your hands

167
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,190
is felt by everyone the same.

168
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,110
Even if you take ten children and tie up their eyes,

169
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,150
ask them, "What is this gentleman suffering from?" -

170
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,210
they don't know if it's a lady or a gentleman,

171
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,180
eyes are tied up - they'll put supposing one finger like this.

172
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,120
That means his Vishuddhi is bad.

173
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,080
You ask the person, "Have you got throat trouble?" -

174
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,120
"How do you know?"

175
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:31,010
We know because this finger is Shri Krishna's finger,

176
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,090
Shri Krishna's place,

177
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,160
this is the throat.

178
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,150
It all relates.

179
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:42,180
Mythology is not all absurd.

180
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,140
Ninety percent is absolutely what it was.

181
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,170
Of course there are some absurd things that have walked in,

182
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,010
but ninety percent mythology, so-called mythology

183
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,070
is absolutely there.

184
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
Now, we go to temples.

185
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,070
We think, this is a temple, going is very good and all that.

186
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,100
But we don't know what we are doing,

187
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,100
what we are praying, whom are we praying,

188
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,160
what are these deities, how they work in ourselves,

189
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,030
where do they reside within ourselves, what is their job?

190
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,170
How to please them?

191
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,130
We don't know anything; 

192
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,000
but you ask these foreigners, they know everything.

193
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,060
First of all they got fed up with Christianity,

194
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,030
that's one thing.

195
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,010
They just got fed up with all the nonsense they found out,

196
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,120
because they're very intelligent, you can see,

197
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,070
and their conditioning was much less.

198
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,200
And they started thinking,

199
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,120
"After all, we don't know why they do like this."

200
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
Then they were just ready.

201
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,160
At that time we exported lots of fake gurus -

202
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,080
the West export is the fake gurus.

203
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,160
Thank God we are saved, we are poor - that's a blessing.

204
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,240
So lots of fake gurus went there and made a lot of money,

205
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,040
and here also we had lots of them.

206
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,200
I mean, we are just good at it, creating lots of fake gurus.

207
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,190
And they befooled people one after another,

208
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,110
made a lot of money.

209
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,160
It's all money-oriented.

210
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,230
In the beginning it was so difficult for Me

211
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,190
because they all used to come with big gusto to fight Me,

212
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,150
because I said you can't take money in the name of God -

213
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,140
that was too much.

214
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,030
"How can She say that you cannot take money?"

215
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,180
But now it's better.

216
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,210
One by one all of them got nicely exposed,

217
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,120
and more will be exposed.

218
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,140
I don't have to tell you about them;

219
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,090
they will be exposed, one by one.

220
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,060
If there is light, all darkness has to go,

221
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,090
and everything that is there has to be exposed.

222
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,240
So everyone feels the same,

223
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,210
there is no quarrel about it;

224
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,100
because the spirit is the reflection of God Almighty,

225
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:11,160
it's one God, who reflects Sadashiva.

226
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,050
Sadashiva, who is a witness to the work of

227
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,010
the Primordial Mother, Adi Shakti,

228
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,050
is just witnessing the play,

229
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,190
just witnessing.

230
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,000
In you He is witnessing as Atma,

231
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,120
but He doesn't come into your attention, He's there.

232
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,130
And His attention

233
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:39,050
is only limited because He has not to

234
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:44,160
any way interfere with your freedom.

235
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,130
So He keeps to Himself, He is just watching.

236
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,160
That is the "auto."

237
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,020
When we say "autonomous nervous system" that is the auto,

238
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,120
that's the spirit.

239
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,190
Now it's the reflection of one Sadashiva.

240
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,070
Naturally all the reflections have to be the same,

241
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,000
their effects have to be the same.

242
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:07,130
Of course, before realization is the reflection on a stone,

243
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,200
we can call it, or on a wall,

244
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,050
or maybe on some sort of a opaque thing.

245
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:20,100
After realization you become reflectors,

246
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,210
beautiful reflectors, and it reflects you.

247
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,140
And everyone reflects the same thing.

248
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,190
So the effect of Atma sakshatkara

249
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,220
is the same on every person,

250
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,050
that first he starts feeling this cool breeze in his hands,

251
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,090
then out of his fontanel bone area.

252
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,220
All of them feel the same way.

253
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,120
Then they start feeling these centers

254
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,170
and finding out what's wrong.

255
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,230
Also all of them become thoughtlessly aware,

256
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,020
first stage which we call as nirvichara samadhi.

257
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,120
Instantaneously it works.

258
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,000
You may say, "Mother, it's very difficult.

259
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,150
How does it happen?

260
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,060
People had to go to Himalayas."

261
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,030
All right, it doesn't matter, you don't have to go.

262
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:14,190
Those days are gone. After all, the civilization,

263
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,110
this tree of civilization has grown so big,

264
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,090
its roots have to be grown;

265
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,060
otherwise the whole civilization will be finished.

266
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,000
And this is the knowledge of the roots,

267
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,110
and that's why to know this knowledge you have to become

268
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,200
subtler, sukshma.

269
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,100
This is only possible when the kundalini rises

270
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,170
and pierces through your fontanel bone,

271
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,120
and makes you connected with the the all-pervading Power

272
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,150
of God's love.

273
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,210
So the first thing that you feel

274
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,190
is collective consciousness,

275
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,170
because everybody is the spirit.

276
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,240
So you can feel another Atma,

277
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,080
you can feel another Atma, you can feel another.

278
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,200
You can feel their body, you can feel their mind,

279
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,200
you can feel anything.

280
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,000
This is the first quality you get,

281
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,070
samuhik chetana, on your nervous system,

282
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,080
on your central nervous system.

283
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,050
Whatever you have got in your evolution

284
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,240
is expressed on your central nervous system.

285
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,200
Now see:

286
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,090
for example, if you have a dog or a horse

287
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,170
and you want to take him through a very dirty lane,

288
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,160
it will go, it won't bother.

289
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,110
But for a human being it is very difficult,

290
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,170
because in our evolution our central nervous system

291
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,060
has developed the sense of smell, a sense of beauty.

292
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,180
All right.

293
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,200
So this they have developed,

294
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,150
and once they have developed,

295
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,100
what happens that

296
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:01,010
now we human beings are definitely higher than animals

297
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:07,000
in our evolution, and in our subtler sensitivities.

298
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,020
For a dog it doesn't matter what you put here,

299
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,160
how you decorate, what color you wear, nothing;

300
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,150
to us it is very important,

301
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:21,020
because our sensitivity has improved.

302
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,070
It has improved

303
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,100
because of our evolutionary process,

304
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,020
we have become human beings.

305
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,000
But in the human stage we have one problem,

306
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,070
and that problem is that we have developed two institutions

307
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:44,040
in our head and it's called as ego and superego,

308
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,010
and you call the ego and the conditioning.

309
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:54,080
These two institutions on our head cross over and calcify,

310
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,100
and we become a closed personality.

311
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,050
When the kundalini rises,

312
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,110
she passes through this Agnya Chakra

313
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:08,140
which is on the optic chiasma, and sucks in these two,

314
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,110
opens the Sahasrara, and the kundalini goes out.

315
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:18,030
This is a living process, this is not that you can do.

316
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,040
Supposing you want to sow a seed,

317
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,180
you cannot pull out a primule, the Ankura

318
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,140
and push it into the thing.

319
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:29,200
You cannot make the seed sprout.

320
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,210
It's a living process of a living God,

321
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,120
and of a living energy.

322
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,110
Please understand, there's a big difference.

323
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:45,110
So this is working out spontaneously,

324
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,070
the rising of the kundalini. She is your Mother,

325
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,100
she moves very beautifully without troubling you.

326
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,110
She knows her child very well.

327
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:58,220
This is the chance she has to give realization to you.

328
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,110
She has loved you all her life, all your lives,

329
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,010
and she knows all about you, all your problems;

330
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,040
like, a naughty boy you have been -

331
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,190
"It doesn't matter," she says,

332
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,210
"this is the chance to give them realization."

333
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,240
It is she who comes up well, beautifully,

334
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,100
works it out, pierces through.

335
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,160
All this happens.

336
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,070
But when she touches the Brahmarandra

337
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,160
or pierces through the Brahmarandra,

338
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,070
then the seat of Sadashiva is here.

339
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,200
He has a reflection here, but the seat is here.

340
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,220
These are the peethas in our head, seven peethas,

341
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,060
and the chakras are down below.

342
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,180
So when she pierces through that,

343
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,160
what we do is actually we have touched

344
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,210
the Feet of Sadashiva,

345
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
and that's how in our heart the spirit

346
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,130
enters into our attention.

347
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,210
When the spirit enters into our attention

348
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,100
we become enlightened, our attention is enlightened,

349
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,010
and this attention

350
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:11,040
is very alert and it knows everything.

351
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,060
Sitting down here you can find out about people,

352
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,140
what they are doing, on the chakras.

353
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,030
You will not discuss what clothes they are wearing,

354
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,230
how much money they have in the bank,

355
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,170
but they will see where are they on their chakras,

356
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:26,200
what's the problem is. Sitting here you can cure them,

357
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,150
sitting here you can help them.

358
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,140
But they have to be one with this all-pervading Power,

359
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,050
that is important.

360
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,130
If they are not, then it takes some time.

361
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,160
So first of all you become nirvichar, nirvichar samadhi,

362
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,170
and you start working out your collective consciousness

363
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,170
by giving realizations to others.

364
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,210
You become entitled to raise this kundalini,

365
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,240
with your hands you can raise the kundalini.

366
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,140
You know these people who are singing here,

367
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,020
some of them have given realization to a thousand people,

368
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,070
and you can do it also,

369
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,100
because now you have the power.

370
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,130
But the problem is,

371
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,200
you have been given the throne,

372
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,150
you have been made to sit on that,

373
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:21,190
now you have been also adorned with a beautiful

374
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,020
mukuta (means crown).

375
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,220
But still you don't want to believe

376
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,130
you have become the king, now how to make you believe?

377
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:33,040
So the second point is self-confidence, is very difficult.

378
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:39,150
They cannot believe that they have got Self-realization.

379
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,220
And "Go ahead with it, work it out. 

380
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,140
You have become your own guru, go ahead with it"

381
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,130
- they cannot, they are afraid.

382
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:51,140
But all these horrible cheats, they have no realization,

383
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,100
they have no knowledge, nothing.

384
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,030
They become the dead gurus,

385
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,050
have thousands of people behind them,

386
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,160
make fool of them, make money and spoil their lives.

387
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:04,000
While those who are Sahaja yogis,

388
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,230
who have all the knowledge, everything:

389
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:13,200
still they are so humble, they are so simple.

390
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,200
But they know about everyone.

391
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,050
Anyone who comes there, they know,

392
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,060
"Ah, we know this one."

393
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,030
They won't say it but they know, all of them.

394
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,120
In their own

395
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:34,130
science they will tell you "this is this" - they know.

396
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,100
Then collectively they will work for that person.

397
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,180
You will not know what they are doing,

398
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,110
and it will work out.

399
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:55,170
So the second nature of the spirit,

400
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,230
apart from that it is a collective being,

401
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,100
it is an absolute being.

402
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,150
We live in a relative world - 

403
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:08,140
this is good, this is bad, that is this, this is that.

404
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:12,060
But it's an absolute being, in the sense,

405
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,080
you put your hands towards a photograph:

406
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,170
immediately, if it is made by a realized soul,

407
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,220
you'll start getting the vibrations.

408
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:26,110
Think of anyone - was that a realized soul?

409
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,070
Just put your hands.

410
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,200
There are many if - people who don't believe in God,

411
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,010
if He's God, so-called, don't believe in God.

412
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,170
I mean, it's most unscientific,

413
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,160
but supposing they don't believe in God,

414
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,190
they have to just ask, "Mother, is there God?" - finished,

415
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,170
they get the vibrations.

416
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,210
All things can be proved.

417
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,110
There is Pramaan (means proof) for everything,

418
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,130
Pramaan for all that is said so far.

419
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,050
This is a very great thing that happens to you,

420
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,140
that you get the Pramaan out of your chaitanya.

421
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:17,240
Then this chitta which is so attentive,

422
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:21,220
which is so dynamic, which is so effective,

423
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,100
also purifies you.

424
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,220
It knows where is your problem,

425
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,030
what chakra is catching, they tell you.

426
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:36,200
Like I was there in Delhi,

427
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,060
they brought three boys. "Mother, their Agnya is catching.

428
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,140
Somehow or other we cannot clear it."

429
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,060
That means they're egoistical.

430
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,210
They also said, "Yes, Mother, we have Agnyas catching, 

431
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,050
we've got headaches."

432
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,050
They're egoistical, but they didn't say they're egoistical.

433
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,140
And they themselves are saying,

434
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,140
"Yes, Mother, our Agnya's catching. Please clear it out."

435
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,200
So you are yourself saying, "I am egoistical."

436
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,220
Because that pains you now that that ego is paining you;

437
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,000
so, "Mother, clear us out, we can't clear out this Agnya."

438
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,230
"All right, come along, I'll clear it out."

439
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,200
So you start judging yourself.

440
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,040
You know about yourself what's wrong with you.

441
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,190
"My this Nabhi is catching,

442
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,040
my that chakra is catching, my that chakra is catching."

443
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,140
They all know about themselves,

444
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,090
and they know how to clarify and clear it out,

445
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:34,010
and work it out. So you cleanse yourself.

446
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,230
But the greatest cleansing comes when you are collective.

447
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,180
Many people take My photograph,

448
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:45,150
"Mother, we do puja, we sit down and meditate;

449
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:49,030
but still again I got this trouble."

450
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,030
You have to be in the collective,

451
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,140
that is a very important part of Sahaja Yoga.

452
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,230
Because now, you see, you don't have to go to Himalayas,

453
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,090
not have to go and jump in the Ganges.

454
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,010
You don't have to do any fasting,

455
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,050
you don't have to say any Japaas (means chants), nothing.

456
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,130
Only one thing: you be collective.

457
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:16,130
Collective is the ocean of the attention of Almighty.

458
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,160
Once you are in the collective you get cleansed.

459
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,060
Like My finger, supposing - is all right,

460
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,120
but supposing a nail is cut out and thrown,

461
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,220
it won't grow. Nobody will pay attention to it.

462
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,230
So you have to come to the collective.

463
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,190
There, ego comes in.

464
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:37,130
There are people who are very big, rich,

465
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,100
very well-educated,

466
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,190
or politicians - you know, big, big, big, big, big people.

467
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,150
They find it difficult

468
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,070
to come down to a humble place, is a center.

469
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:53,080
They want another palace to be created for them,

470
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,020
"otherwise how can we go there?"

471
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,050
It's Mother's house.

472
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,030
Even if your mother is humble,

473
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,240
she doesn't have much money - "All right, doesn't matter,

474
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,010
it's my mother's house."

475
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,110
And they don't come, and then they lose vibrations.

476
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,030
This is a very common failing, specially in India,

477
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,090
not in the West

478
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,130
because they know what precious thing they have achieved.

479
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,070
We have no idea as to what it is that we have achieved,

480
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,100
our Atma sakshatkara.

481
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,020
So again next year I come,

482
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,040
"Mother, I have this problem, that problem.

483
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,020
I've been meditating at home all right."

484
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,170
If you don't come to the collective,

485
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,170
you cannot cleanse yourself.

486
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,080
That's the only way in Sahaja Yoga you can cleanse yourself,

487
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,160
and you can be above everything else.

488
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,180
So when the kundalini passes through your Agnya Chakra,

489
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,200
you become thoughtlessly aware.

490
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:01,010
A thought rises and falls, another thought rises and falls.

491
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,150
Some come from the past, some come from the future;

492
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,210
but we are not in the present.

493
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,190
If I say "you be in the present," you cannot be.

494
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:15,050
That's why kundalini awakening is a happening

495
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,140
which attracts your attention inside.

496
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,220
Just like this sari of Mine is the kundalini coming up -

497
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,120
see now it's spread out like that;

498
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,000
but when she's coming up

499
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,110
she's pulling all the attention inside.

500
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,230
And that's how your attention goes in.

501
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,180
And when she pierces through,

502
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,060
then there is a space in between

503
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,130
the thought called as "vilamba"

504
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,150
- this, of course, so everybody knows perhaps -

505
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,090
that increases, that is the present.

506
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,120
So we have to be in the vartamaan (means present),

507
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,210
we have to be in the present,

508
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,100
then we are thoughtless.

509
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,140
Say the waves of water rising, falling,

510
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,160
you are facing the water;

511
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,220
but when you are in the water you are afraid,

512
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,030
frightened,

513
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,050
when you have problems you are frightened.

514
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,170
But supposing somebody takes you out and puts you into a

515
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,030
boat, then you see it,

516
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:17,130
you can solve your problems.

517
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,180
But supposing you know how to swim,

518
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,020
you can jump down and save many others.

519
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,040
So in three stages you move.

520
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,140
So the growth only takes place

521
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,040
when you are thoughtlessly aware.

522
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,140
And that can be achieved in collectivity

523
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,190
as well as in your meditation,

524
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
for which you don't have to pay.

525
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,230
Some people have an opening introduction lecture free,

526
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,230
and then the second one is banking.

527
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,030
Sahaja Yoga is not like that.

528
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,150
All this nonsense is not in Sahaja Yoga.

529
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,090
It's reality, and reality cannot be purchased.

530
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,050
Actually God doesn't know bank,

531
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,120
He doesn't know money.

532
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,140
He doesn't understand anything about money.

533
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,080
He has not made money: this is your headache,not His.

534
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,230
Of course, supposing I had to fly I have to pay,

535
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,070
it is all right.

536
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,170
If I have to get a hall I have to pay;

537
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,120
but for the hall, not for God.

538
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,180
For awakening,

539
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,130
for enlightenment you cannot charge any fee.

540
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,020
Even for darshan I am told people charge money - imagine.

541
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:42,000
For them everything is money, money, money, money, money.

542
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,170
How can they rise to the level of spirit?

543
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,180
And we are so simple, you know,

544
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,090
the bhaktas are so simple. "All right, you want five rupees,

545
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,060
I'll sell my ring and give you.

546
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:00,050
You want this, I'll give you this."

547
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,100
There was a guru in America

548
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,010
who had, I think, forty-eight Rolls Royce or something,

549
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,000
I had forgotten the counts,

550
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,170
and he wanted one more.

551
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,180
So he told his disciples

552
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,010
that "You should somehow or other get me one more

553
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,180
Rolls Royce, then I'll come to England."

554
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,160
So poor things were living on potatoes,

555
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,130
starving themselves.

556
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,040
So one of the Sahaja yogis said, "What are you doing?

557
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,070
Why does he want a Rolls Royce?

558
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,170
What is his interest in Rolls Royce?"

559
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,230
He says, "You know, we are just giving him the metal,

560
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,090
but he's giving us the spirit."

561
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,160
Can you imagine it?

562
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,190
Metal can be exchanged for spirit!

563
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,020
Must be some sort of a bhoot badha

564
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,160
he must be putting on them,

565
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,220
and that in English language is "spirit."

566
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,030
English language is very dangerous,

567
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:58,160
because "spirit" is wine,

568
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,230
"spirit" is Atma and "spirit" is a bhoot -

569
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,180
I don't know which spirit they mean!

570
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,160
So,

571
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:19,190
the relationship

572
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:24,090
with God if it has to establish,

573
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:28,170
we have to become first of all the spirit;

574
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,230
then only this relation can be established.

575
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:39,160
One may certify oneself, "I am this, I am that"

576
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:44,170
but it's no good, it is of no use;

577
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,200
because this human body is given to you.

578
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:55,020
Imagine what this divine Power must have done

579
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:59,050
to make you a human being - how gently,

580
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:04,110
carefully, beautifully you are made a human being.

581
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,090
And now, why this human body you have got it?

582
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,230
What are we using it for?

583
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:18,210
We must evaluate our human life, what is it for?

584
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:24,130
Is it for just insurance or I don't know what else they do;

585
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,050
but is it for something,

586
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:32,220
that we become the light of the world?

587
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:41,200
So this light of the spirit spreads in the attention,

588
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:48,230
and the attention becomes dynamic, active, works out,

589
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,090
it's very alert and extremely punctual.

590
00:43:54,230 --> 00:44:01,100
Then this attention doesn't get bored at all.

591
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,080
People don't know what is boredom is,

592
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:11,000
because this boredom comes when your attention

593
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,220
becomes tired.

594
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,190
But here the attention is full of light,

595
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,130
so they don't know what is boredom is.

596
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:26,220
The second thing that is the nature of spirit is

597
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,050
that it tells you the truth, the absolute truth,

598
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,180
nothing but the truth.

599
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,140
Anything that these chaitanya lahiris tell you,

600
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:46,160
when you are matured enough, not before that;

601
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,160
when your connection is complete -

602
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:51,190
otherwise halfway you are connected and halfway you're not,

603
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,090
then no - but when you are mature:

604
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:57,000
that is the state of nirvikalpa.

605
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:58,200
When you become that,

606
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,230
then your attention is absolutely correct,

607
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,120
your vibrations are correct and the report is absolutely correct,

608
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:09,240
and what information you get is hundred percent truth;

609
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,130
so the truth about anyone.

610
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:19,000
Now, say we want to know about Shri Ganesh.

611
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,110
We worship Shri Ganesh.

612
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,140
Many people make fun of Him,

613
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,090
even so-called intellectuals, you see.

614
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,170
They don't know what to say,

615
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,210
so they start saying nonsensical things about Shri Ganesha,

616
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:35,180
you see - it's a sin.

617
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,210
But you can ask,

618
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:47,080
"Mother, is Gauri Putra is bestowed upon the Mooladhara,

619
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,110
in ourselves?"

620
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,180
Of course,

621
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,070
all those who are realized will get tremendous vibrations,

622
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,220
and you too.

623
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,030
If you have doubts, if you are worshipping

624
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:02,000
Shri Ganesha, you ask this question;

625
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,140
if you are worshipping Shri Vishnu you ask that question.

626
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,100
If you are worshipping Christ, you ask that question;

627
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,030
if you are worshipping Shiva you ask that question.

628
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,210
What's wrong with us, that without connection we are calling,

629
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,090
"Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva" ? Is He in our pocket?

630
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:27,210
How can you just - because is He our servant or what?

631
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:32,040
But if you are realized, even taking once His name is sufficient;

632
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:36,090
He acts, because we are in His kingdom.

633
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:43,070
In this kingdom of yours, in the Indian kingdom that is there,

634
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:47,200
you may call anybody; nobody will come in any case,

635
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,230
the question doesn't arise.

636
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,210
And when you start calling God also without connection,

637
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,130
it won't act.

638
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,240
But if you are connected,

639
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:04,020
then not only that that deity will help,

640
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,210
the one who is troubling you will be all right.

641
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:11,080
Not only that, but whatever you want is done,

642
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,110
and it happens.

643
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:17,040
All kinds of manorathas (means wishes or desires)

644
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,140
are fulfilled.

645
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,200
So whether we should call it

646
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,040
enlightenment or fulfillment is your own choice;

647
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,120
it's complete fulfillment of your own being.

648
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:40,020
So the third nature of the spirit is that it is love.

649
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,210
Because it is love, it gives you joy.

650
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:50,190
But nirvaj - this love doesn't want anything,

651
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:57,090
it just gives; such a soothing, beautiful feeling.

652
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:59,210
People have stress.

653
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:04,170
After doing all kind of nonsensical things

654
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,120
you will have stress, no doubt.

655
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:14,050
But when the hole is made here, all your stress goes out.

656
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:16,050
There's no more stress.

657
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,240
We don't know what is stress is.

658
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,040
People don't go to doctors,

659
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,210
even the doctors don't go to doctors,

660
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,030
they come to Me.

661
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:29,090
I'm not a doctor, but they come to Me - surprising.

662
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:34,090
This is meta-modern science,

663
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:37,060
meta-modern - above modern science.

664
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:41,070
But do you know, we are Indians,

665
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:44,160
have this heritage of our own;

666
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,130
we believe more in the English language,

667
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:51,050
more in the English dress,

668
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,090
more in the English knowledge,

669
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,240
because we know English only.

670
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,070
But those who know French will believe in French.

671
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,240
Now the time has come that they should believe in us,

672
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,220
because we don't believe in our own country,

673
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,180
we don't believe in our own culture,

674
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:14,110
we don't believe in our own knowledge.

675
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:17,130
This is nothing new I am telling you.

676
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,030
Sahaja Yoga is a very ancient -

677
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,030
Nanaka sahaja samadhi [*]lago.

678
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,060
Every saint has described.

679
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,200
But we are doing this, that, all ritualism,

680
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,230
karma kandis, this, that.

681
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:45,090
This cannot give you the ultimate - cannot.

682
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:48,190
I am telling you, that's the truth.

683
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:56,110
Spirit is what we have to be.

684
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:59,080
That's the ultimate goal of our life.

685
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:03,080
Then the, all the rest of them fall in line.

686
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:12,060
And that's what we have got from every scriptures,

687
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:15,000
from every incarnation,

688
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:17,170
from everywhere.

689
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:23,210
Let us now just think that let us become the spirit,

690
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:32,040
and then let us become a realized soul, a master.

691
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,080
May God bless you all.

692
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:52,210
They didn't bring any questions?

693
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:04,150
There are some nice questions

694
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:10,030
which I will answer before I give you realization.

695
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,020
If you want to go out for five minutes you can go,

696
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,090
and then you can come back.

697
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:18,020
In the meanwhile there are questions.

698
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:21,060
Should we focus our attention while meditating,

699
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,110
on the top of the head?

700
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,050
You don't have to focus anything anywhere.

701
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:28,020
You're not doing anything,

702
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,180
it is the kundalini which is coming up.

703
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,190
So you don't have to do it. Don't fight with your attention.

704
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:38,060
It will just - she will manage it. She knows her job.

705
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,140
That's one point.

706
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:52,010
Do the deities like Shri Ganesha, Mahavishnu etc.

707
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:55,150
have the forms as depicted in our scriptures? Of course!

708
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,130
That are the deities.

709
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:05,210
Or do they stand for some state of mystic consciousness

710
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:09,200
pertaining to yogic centers? Of course, they do.

711
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:15,020
These deities are there.

712
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,240
Ganesha is just like Ganesha.

713
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:24,010
Of course, in color He differs from one to another -

714
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:25,090
depends on.

715
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,070
But

716
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:33,150
His state of mystic consciousness is different

717
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:36,160
from that of Vishnu,

718
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,180
from that of Shiva.

719
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:43,070
He does His job.

720
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:49,060
Everybody is the perfect master of their jobs,

721
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,230
but they are in the form,

722
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:56,030
absolutely in the form as you know them, no doubt.

723
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,210
What a blessing we have! I mean, imagine,

724
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,180
I had to talk about Ganesha to these people,

725
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:05,240
who had - they didn't know even the word "G"!

726
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:10,010
Isn't it just ...?

727
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,180
They didn't know anything about it.

728
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:15,190
And they have mastered Ganesha.

729
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,110
Now ask them, they'll tell you all the chakras, everything.

730
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,040
All this knowledge is here in this country of ours,

731
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,120
all these beautiful jewels are here.

732
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,010
When we are in the midst of people

733
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,170
not familiar with Sahaja Yoga,

734
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,210
can we mentally imagine the form of Reverend Mataji,

735
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:40,160
instead of keeping Her photo in front? Of course, you can.

736
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:48,090
Yes, My photograph sometimes

737
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,210
is used in very funny places

738
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,190
that should not be such, it's not a protocol.

739
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,080
It should be used in a place where

740
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:04,130
you are with people who are Sahaja yogis,

741
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:07,110
or in your houses, homes;

742
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:10,080
you shouldn't use them everywhere.

743
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:19,000
Now, this is a dangerous question! -

744
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,200
Does non-vegetarian food affect the sadhana?

745
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,060
Is vegetarian food is preferable?

746
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:27,230
Now if I say anything you are going to be angry!

747
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:30,190
But I'll tell you.

748
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:37,020
In Sahaja Yoga, you are not supposed to eat any flesh of

749
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,220
a bigger animal than yourself.

750
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,220
If you are vegetarian, you could be vegetarian;

751
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,050
if you are non-vegetarian you can be non-veg.

752
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,180
But it depends on what sort of a personality you are.

753
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,040
Supposing you are a right-sided person,

754
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,170
you'd better be vegetarians.

755
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,120
But if you are left-sided,

756
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,100
it's better to take to proteins.

757
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,210
So we're talking proteins and carbohydrates.

758
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,150
Take any kind of proteins.

759
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:12,100
Now we Indians don't eat any proteins.

760
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:16,160
Except for Idli (a South indian dish)

761
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,030
I don't think we eat any proteins.

762
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,220
That too, we have rice with it.

763
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:25,050
Proteins must be eaten by Indians,

764
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:26,110
I am of that opinion,

765
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:29,000
because we have become so weak.

766
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:32,230
As it is, we are so frightened of income tax,

767
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,030
this tax, tax;

768
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,150
plus we are so weak,

769
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:41,120
because we eat absolutely insipid food.

770
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,190
So we should eat nourishing food,

771
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,130
specially proteins in any form.

772
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:50,000
But not the animal which is bigger than you.

773
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,000
Like people eat horses -

774
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,060
I don't know what else they'll be doing, anything;

775
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,040
elephant, I think!

776
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,180
For everyone there is no prescription.

777
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:12,190
According to your nature you should eat.

778
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,140
I mean, so many people don't do Sahaja Yoga when I say this,

779
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,100
just imagine.

780
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,100
They miss their Atma sakshatkara because of this.

781
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,190
I mean, how did you become a vegetarian?

782
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,240
Because your mother was a vegetarian,

783
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:27,230
what else?

784
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:31,040
From where did you learn vegetarianism?

785
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,160
Supposing you were a Muslim,

786
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,070
then you would have eaten somebody's heads also!

787
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:44,190
So luckily you are born in a Hindu community,

788
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:47,120
but we go too far with it.

789
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:49,240
Morning till evening -

790
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:54,000
I mean, this ritualism is so much in Madras also

791
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,080
that they told Me,

792
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:58,060
"Mother, Sahaja Yoga can never work in Madras."

793
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,000
I said, "Why?"

794
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:02,170
"Because people are not at all sahaj.

795
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:05,010
In the morning they must get up at four o'clock,

796
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:08,110
have their bath, go to the temple, come back.

797
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:10,070
If one day they don't do it,

798
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,130
then the whole day they are like mad people,

799
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,130
thinking they have committed the greatest sin -

800
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,170
this routine must be done."

801
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,030
There is no routine in Sahaja Yoga.

802
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:24,100
It's a living process.

803
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:28,130
There is no routine in living process.

804
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,030
Whenever the flower wants, it will flower.

805
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:37,170
So why kill yourself with these rituals?

806
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,190
This is our problem in the Hindu religion,

807
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,060
the same with the Christians;

808
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:44,220
I mean, everybody is competing.

809
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,070
God has created this world for us to enjoy.

810
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,200
I tell you,

811
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:56,160
if you give up this you'll be very much absolutely relaxed.

812
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,160
Forget it!

813
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,130
At the most, five minutes in the morning

814
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,020
Sahaja Yoga meditation,

815
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:07,030
and ten minutes in the evening before sleeping - finished.

816
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,190
For that we have a center,

817
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:11,160
you go and see them - that's all.

818
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:15,170
The rest God will do for you.

819
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,130
Now this is a nice question also -

820
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,210
What is the final realization in sadhana?

821
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:26,040
How should one proceed in that direction,

822
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:29,190
after he feels the vibrations in his head and palms,

823
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,140
initially? That's good,

824
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,100
that means you have felt it, Mr. Subramaniam,

825
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,040
and I'm happy to know about this.

826
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,240
But I would say that you have to come to our center

827
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,130
and proceed with it.

828
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:43,100
But we don't talk of the future,

829
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:46,180
we talk of the present.

830
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:51,040
Slowly you will be surprised how you are rising,

831
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:57,120
how you are really getting all the powers in yourself.

832
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:00,180
You yourself will realize, and you will be amazed.

833
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,100
I mean, you'll be surprised,

834
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:05,110
some people I have met after one year -

835
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,220
I have a very good memory,

836
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:09,140
but I could not recognize them.

837
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:25,090
Now, this gentleman is here,

838
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,130
and he's something personal problem,

839
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:30,020
poor thing.

840
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,090
He went to this Navoli of Hatha Yoga,

841
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,160
and he's suffering.

842
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:39,220
This Hatha Yoga is another funny stuff.

843
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,160
If you read Patanjali,

844
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,140
you'll know it's Ashtanga Yoga.

845
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:48,100
Out of this exercises, wee, wee, wee, wee,

846
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:52,000
wee bit of that is so important.

847
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,190
Anybody can come and teach you Hatha Yoga;

848
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,190
unless and until he's a realized soul,

849
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:59,140
he has no right to teach you anything.

850
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:03,210
What I've said today is nirvichar samadhi,

851
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,070
nirvikalpa - all is written there,

852
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:09,020
and he calls all this all-pervading Power

853
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,090
as ritambara pragya.

854
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:17,130
Somebody teaches you something - "Ha, tha" - finished.

855
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:22,060
People are running like mad, jumping like mad.

856
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,220
You become right-sided, then you get heart attacks;

857
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:26,190
now this gentleman has a problem.

858
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,030
But I assure you, you'll be all right.

859
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:31,030
You take to Sahaja Yoga, it's very simple,

860
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:33,100
it will give you a balance, you'll be all right.

861
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:39,140
Then Hatha Yoga, then going Gayatri Mantra:

862
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:41,110
you become more right-sided.

863
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:44,060
Learn what is needed for you.

864
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,030
For a person who is right-sided,

865
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,070
you have to have bhakti.

866
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,100
Those who are left-sided have to have this.

867
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,180
You have to give balance to yourself.

868
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:00,070
And it will really give you such a joy.

869
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,190
Otherwise if there's some Hatha yogi,

870
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,030
you'd better approach him with a barge-pole;

871
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:09,060
God knows when he will slap you - like Duruwasha

872
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,200
It's very dangerous people.

873
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:15,010
They don't know what is love is,

874
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:20,070
they don't know what is Mother is.

875
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,230
There's no talk of love.

876
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,080
Is self-awareness

877
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:42,030
a pre-requisite to practice on progress of

878
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:46,140
realizing kundalini shakti? No.

879
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,120
After realization you become self-aware.

880
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:53,040
Nothing is needed.

881
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,130
Now for example, people go on telling,

882
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,160
"You have committed this sin. All right,

883
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:04,130
pay so much money to me and all your sins will be finished."

884
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,110
I tell you, put him to the police.

885
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:15,030
To Me nobody is a sinner, no. You are My children.

886
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:17,210
Nobody is a sinner.

887
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,230
You have committed no sins, no wrong, nothing.

888
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,150
You were mistaking something,

889
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:27,000
you went into darkness;

890
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:33,140
or I can say that you were ignorant, at the most.

891
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,230
But I don't like to call any human being as a sinner,

892
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:39,070
except for they're rakshasas.

893
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,230
Of course there are rakshasas,

894
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,130
then they are already branded,

895
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:46,130
you don't have to say it, they're already there.

896
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:52,140
So this self-awareness is what you have to get.

897
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:55,030
We are not self-aware.

898
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:58,160
By doing it, we cannot.

899
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,230
When we say, "I have to be self-aware.

900
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:03,060
Now I have to be self-aware, I have to go inside" -

901
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:06,050
what are we using? Our ego.

902
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:11,140
It's a happening.

903
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,090
When you will achieve that state,

904
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:17,090
that state - not human state,

905
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,230
but a state of a yogi -

906
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:25,150
there at that state you have self-awareness,

907
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:28,210
and you respect yourself.

908
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:31,240
You have your self-esteem.

909
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:34,060
But you don't show off,

910
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:36,110
you don't become cheapish person.

911
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:11,000
He says that "Mother,

912
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:15,070
I have recently started meditating in the Sahaja way,

913
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:20,200
and I feel absolutely fresh and beautiful all the time.

914
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:22,240
Though, Mother, put very humbly,

915
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:25,230
say that the energy is our own,

916
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:29,090
I have never felt this energy before.

917
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:33,230
Mother, so kindly let us know if we are

918
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,120
re-linked to the God or the main source,

919
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:43,020
and that is the reason why we feel full of energy

920
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,160
throughout?"

921
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,020
Of course, you are feeling because you are re-linked,

922
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,130
no doubt about it.

923
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,230
But you don't feel any energy because

924
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:56,000
you must be a very good man.

925
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:59,040
When there is obstruction,

926
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:03,120
then only you feel a little problem.

927
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:05,230
Like a smooth landing,

928
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:07,060
you don't feel it;

929
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,120
if you get a smooth landing in Sahaja Yoga,

930
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:13,040
means you are a very nice person,

931
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:16,020
very good man, righteous man.

932
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:20,100
Just smoothly you land, there's no obstruction, nothing.

933
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:22,020
You have no imbalances,

934
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:24,130
you are in the center, no problem.

935
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:27,060
But if you have problems,

936
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:32,090
then the kundalini a little bit goes, comes down.

937
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:37,140
And that's why you don't feel it.

938
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,040
Those who have problems

939
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:42,180
do feel a little pain sometimes here and there.

940
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:46,030
But if the kundalini just rises up,

941
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:50,100
know that you are righteous, you are good.

942
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,230
Is the term "God" given to all unexplainable questions

943
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:07,070
as their explanation manas? No, no, no.

944
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,210
In Sahaja Yoga everything is explained

945
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:13,020
and can be proved Pramana.

946
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:24,110
Has anyone seen, heard, felt or realized

947
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:29,010
his ultimate control, master, owner, decision-maker?

948
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:33,230
Of course! So many of them, don't you know?

949
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,100
There are so many.

950
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:49,160
Does the final authority lives outside every man,

951
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:52,160
or does it reside inside everyone?

952
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:55,030
He is reflected in everyone,

953
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:03,060
but the reflection cannot be the object.

954
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,160
But the reflection can be equal to the object,

955
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:10,030
depending on the reflector.

956
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:21,130
If anyone has realized the ultimate truth, why did he die?

957
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:43,020
These are big, big things he has asked.

958
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:44,210
You see, I think the gentleman 

959
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,150
who is asking Me this question,

960
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:49,080
I would ask him first of all to get your realization.

961
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,190
He's quite confused gentleman.

962
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:58,130
You see, just now - "What is God? What is death?"

963
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,070
What are you?

964
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,160
Find out first.

965
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:06,170
Who is asking this question? ....

966
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:14,050
He is asking from a center? Oh, my God!

967
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,040
It's interesting, eh,

968
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,200
that he's asking from a center all these questions.

969
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:23,100
That means he's too much thinking, thinking, thinking.

970
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:39,230
Is wrong to say that God is in good?

971
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:42,200
I think he's done too much reading,

972
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,190
that's the problem.

973
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,160
First you know the reality, My child,

974
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:54,020
then all these questions will disappear - nirvikalpa. ....

975
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:13,100
Now he's talking about ideal good and all that.

976
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:24,010
It's definitely true that man lives only once ...

977
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:28,100
It's wrong. Who told you that? He doesn't.

978
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:33,140
But if you believe in that I cannot help it,

979
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:35,140
but it's not so.

980
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:39,130
And that to be good and to be righteous

981
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:43,010
is not the end of your search.

982
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:49,060
Dharma is the balance,

983
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:52,070
that gives you the balance.

984
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:55,030
But balance for what, dharma for what?

985
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,210
We should ask the question.

986
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,240
Why should we be dharmic; why not be adharmic?

987
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:04,220
Why not ask such a question? It's logical.

988
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:09,020
Why do all this dharma, dharma, dharma?

989
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,020
Because you have to rise.

990
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:16,030
Say an aeroplane is not balanced,

991
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:17,160
how will it rise?

992
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,090
But supposing it is only balanced and never rises,

993
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:24,090
what's the use of making an aeroplane?

994
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,150
So you have to be dharmateet.

995
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:30,010
You have to go beyond dharma,

996
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,200
you have to go beyond gunas - it's gunateet -

997
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:38,150
you cross over, then dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

998
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:42,120
You don't have to tell yourself, "Don't do this, don't ..."

999
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,220
No, you just don't do it, try anything.

1000
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:50,210
I'll tell you My own example.

1001
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:53,010
You know I have a double life.

1002
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:57,180
My husband is a - what is he, you must have known about him

1003
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:00,230
- he's a big, big, big boss of something,

1004
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:07,070
and I've lived with all that nonsense all My life.

1005
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:12,030
When he went to England

1006
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:16,180
they asked him, "Why don't you have dancing with us?"

1007
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:18,170
He said, "Because my wife doesn't dance,

1008
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,150
I don't want to dance." He puts everything on Me,

1009
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:23,090
it's a very good way of escaping!

1010
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:26,120
So they said, "No, no, bring Her to London,

1011
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,200
She'll be all right.

1012
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,130
If you bring Her to London She'll start dancing."

1013
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:32,080
He said, "You even take Her to moon, She will not!"

1014
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:38,170
So this is what it is. The dharma is innate, you just don't do it.

1015
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:43,140
Not because of conditioning, or it's better - it is Sahaj.

1016
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:48,030
Sahaja, you - just, you just don't do it.

1017
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,170
"No, I will not do that."

1018
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:54,030
You will never do wrong things,

1019
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:58,100
because you will just not do it.

1020
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:04,070
So this has to go beyond dharma,

1021
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,080
means the dharma is part and parcel of that.

1022
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:11,050
Gunateet means you are beyond gunas.

1023
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:16,100
You are neither right-sided, left-sided, centered,

1024
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:18,000
but you are beyond.

1025
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,190
What is left, right, center, what is this,

1026
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:24,020
why to hang like that? - better be above.

1027
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:27,030
That is what happens to you.

1028
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,050
So "only there are righteous people":

1029
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:31,160
many righteous people came and went away,

1030
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:34,050
had no effect on the public.

1031
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:40,190
What is needed is your emancipation, your ascent;

1032
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,080
that's what we have to achieve.

1033
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:48,030
"Only the good" - so-called good;

1034
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:51,150
and you cannot establish good, I tell you.

1035
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:55,150
Nobody likes to follow a good person.

1036
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:01,100
Like in Pune they were saying,

1037
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:05,100
"Everybody takes - they eats money, they never eat food."

1038
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:07,210
I said, "Really?"

1039
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,070
So I told My husband,

1040
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:11,070
"Everybody eats money" - he was in London.

1041
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:14,190
He said, "You tell them “My husband never took any bribe.'"

1042
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,030
So I told them, "My husband never took any bribe."

1043
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:19,220
They said, "Why didn't he take? Who told him not to take?"

1044
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:26,190
So what happens is

1045
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:31,080
that normally people never follow a person who is

1046
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:34,020
good and righteous, never.

1047
01:14:36,030 --> 01:14:38,220
But they'll always follow a person who is a

1048
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:40,030
little bit like this.

1049
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:44,070
The reason is, we are coming from animal stage -

1050
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:47,070
easy to go back.

1051
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:54,190
But once you're realized, then it's difficult;

1052
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:58,110
means once the flower becomes the fruit,

1053
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:03,220
it cannot become the flower - as simple as that.

1054
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:09,100
So I say you've come here, all right, very sweetly,

1055
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:14,060
and then get your realization; then I'll talk to you.

1056
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,230
Then you yourself will say - and now,

1057
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:18,120
see these people who were singing here,

1058
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:22,070
some of them were terrible drug addicts, terrible!

1059
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:24,020
They couldn't even see Me. They said,

1060
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,010
"We saw these lights coming out of You,

1061
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,220
never saw You" when they came - in comas.

1062
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:34,180
Overnight, finished - alcoholics, overnight.

1063
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:36,180
I didn't tell them. I never tell,

1064
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:39,100
"Don't drink, don't ..." I never use that word.

1065
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:43,180
Let the light of your spirit come in, and you are there.

1066
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:47,100
I don't have to tell you anything,

1067
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:50,080
all habits you'll drop by yourself.

1068
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,020
Do you see the point?

1069
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:59,130
Because when the light comes in,

1070
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:03,050
the darkness has to run away.

1071
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:08,010
So righteousness is not sufficient enough.

1072
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,150
You have to go beyond that.

1073
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:35,050
Somebody has written about his friend who has a problem,

1074
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:37,170
who's fallen down, had an accident.

1075
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,190
He should go and ask the Sahaja yogis to help him.

1076
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:46,040
Nowadays I don't cure people, because there's no need to;

1077
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:49,040
I'm doing all other nonsensical things.

1078
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:53,010
The curing nowadays' done by Sahaja yogis.

1079
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:58,010
There are so many other things I have to see to.

1080
01:16:58,150 --> 01:16:59,200
So you call anyone,

1081
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:03,010
they'll be very helpful and they will do it.

1082
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:10,050
Ah, it's a good question -

1083
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:15,180
Is it possible to cure the suffering and poor

1084
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,100
with this Sahaja Yoga?

1085
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:19,220
Can we get rid of our poverty?

1086
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,110
We can, by all means -

1087
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,010
if you stop fasting first.

1088
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:34,050
You want to fast? "All right," God says, "all right, go ahead. 

1089
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:38,110
You'll not get food." Finished! Your wish will be fulfilled.

1090
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:41,220
You want to become like a sanyasi?

1091
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:45,240
Want to wear torn clothes? All right, have poverty.

1092
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:49,060
You want poverty, after all you asked for it.

1093
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:58,000
Then, you want sufferings? "We must suffer."

1094
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,170
There's so many nonsensical things going on

1095
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:03,080
that "you must suffer." Then how?

1096
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:07,080
"I have suffer " - all right, if you want that, you enjoy it.

1097
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:12,210
You ask for prosperity, you'll get it,

1098
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:16,010
after kundalini awakening.

1099
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:19,130
You see the center there, called as the Nabhi Chakra,

1100
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:22,160
and who is sitting there is Lakshmi Narayana.

1101
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,010
Once Lakshmi Narayana is awakened within you,

1102
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,210
how can you be poor?

1103
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:35,190
But also money has its own problems.

1104
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:43,030
You get wealth, which is satisfying.

1105
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:48,060
But don't ask for poverty.

1106
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:53,040
Leave alone you, now the Westerners have got

1107
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:56,180
a great desire for poverty.

1108
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,210
They wear pants, they said they are holey,

1109
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:01,180
means there are holes.

1110
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:06,020
Torn pants they wear - in England, imagine,

1111
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:09,070
such a cold country, wearing holey pants,

1112
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,220
getting varicose veins.

1113
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:16,080
And so many nonsensical suffering is going on there,

1114
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,060
so many.

1115
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:21,190
(Such a long letter - should write small one.)

1116
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:29,170
So that's going on, and that's how people ask for it.

1117
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:33,060
So there is recession in America, recession in England,

1118
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:37,140
recession in Spain, crawling into France - have it.

1119
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:40,070
If you want to have poverty, have it.

1120
01:19:41,130 --> 01:19:44,090
So the Lakshmi chit is going to come this side, I think.

1121
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,020
Some sense is coming into our government,

1122
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:53,080
and I'm sure it will work out - hope so.

1123
01:19:53,210 --> 01:19:56,080
But you take to Sahaja Yoga and you'll be surprised.

1124
01:19:56,210 --> 01:20:00,190
For example, in England we have such a lot of unemployment,

1125
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:04,200
but not one Sahaja yogi is unemployed, not one.

1126
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:11,150
At least with this fellow one at least ...

1127
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,150
he will take to Sahaja Yoga, to begin with.

1128
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:27,070
Mother, Sahaja Yoga is for health and joy

1129
01:20:27,150 --> 01:20:31,010
only, or is it something more? Everything - totality.

1130
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:32,210
What do you want?

1131
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:35,110
Ask for it,

1132
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:42,000
desire for it - everything.

1133
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:58,170
He says it's not explained to him.

1134
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:00,230
You see, just now I'll give you realization,

1135
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:03,200
you will see how the chakras are opened out and all that.

1136
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:06,120
But later on if you go to the center you can know

1137
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:10,100
everything, in one year you'll be all masters.

1138
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:13,240
But give some time to yourself, is the point.

1139
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:15,190
People are very busy these days.

1140
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:17,060
What are you doing?

1141
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:21,060
Some ladies told Me they're very busy with [*]kitty parties!

1142
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,110
Here are very few ladies in here,

1143
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:30,110
Madras; all the ladies must be in the temple sitting,

1144
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:34,120
cutting, shaving their heads.

1145
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:41,120
And very educated women also do it.

1146
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:44,020
I mean, why, why should we shave your head?

1147
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:47,070
God has lots of hair - you don't have to cut.

1148
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:51,100
All this nonsense!

1149
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:59,080
Women can be much more shakti shali than men,

1150
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:04,080
but this conditioning of the women of India - God knows.

1151
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:09,070
All right. So now we are ...

1152
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,010
He's saying, "I have been practising pranayama

1153
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:23,120
for four years. I don't have teacher ..." Very dangerous.

1154
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:28,180
If you have no teacher, whether you have teacher or not,

1155
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,220
pranayama is very dangerous.

1156
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:40,060
Ha! If you have problem with your lungs,

1157
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:43,060
or some specific reason ....

1158
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,060
You see, all these vyayamas (means exercise),

1159
01:22:45,150 --> 01:22:49,070
were given for specific reason, for specific chakras.

1160
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:50,220
Now, the kundalini's rising;

1161
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,240
supposing she stops at your stomach, Nabhi,

1162
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:58,130
and you are doing pranayama, what's the use?

1163
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:02,190
You should know where the kundalini is there.

1164
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:06,050
For example, today I was coming by car.

1165
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:12,180
Now they stopped Me at one point, then at second point.

1166
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,140
When the car started moving,

1167
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:17,050
then only I knew where it is going to stop.

1168
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,060
Beforehand, how can I do it?

1169
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:22,170
In the same way,

1170
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:25,050
when kundalini rises - use your brains! -

1171
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:27,010
then she stops at a point,

1172
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:33,010
then you should know by what vyayama you can put it right.

1173
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:35,040
It's very scientific.

1174
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:40,060
We too use, but not like all the medicines from

1175
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:43,070
the medicine box taking,

1176
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,120
morning till evening.

1177
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:49,200
And that's why they say they develop problems - they do.

1178
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,030
You will, very soon.

1179
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,240
It's a very dangerous thing.

1180
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:15,190
You see, actually we are not only physical being.

1181
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:19,110
We don't live in only on prana - that's right.

1182
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:23,070
I've seen people who practise pranayama,

1183
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:25,120
if they're married - thank God you're not married -

1184
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,180
they divorce their wives,

1185
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:30,030
because there's no love.

1186
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:36,170
They're very dry people, extremely dried up;

1187
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,090
no poetry in their life.

1188
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:46,010
All right, you'd better start reading some nice poetry!

1189
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,120
Now, he is saying there -

1190
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,210
"Could you please tell what is right-sided and left-sided?"

1191
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:57,040
It's quite a long subject,

1192
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:59,080
but if you go to Sahaja Yoga they will tell you.

1193
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:06,190
Right-sided is physical and emotional energy,

1194
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:13,030
used for physical and - sorry, physical and mental work.

1195
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:17,030
Left-sided is the energy for emotions.

1196
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:19,040
Now for example, he's doing pranayama.

1197
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:22,000
He's doing that, he'll become right-sided -

1198
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:26,210
only if you do that.

1199
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:43,220
When the kundalini is in the process of awakening,

1200
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:46,000
is one getting fear?

1201
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,140
No, you do not. She's your mother.

1202
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,190
She will bear all the problems.

1203
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,220
When you were born, your mother bore all the problems,

1204
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:56,220
all the labor pains. She didn't trouble you, did she?

1205
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,120
She, poor thing, suffered for you.

1206
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:04,230
And once you are born she forgets everything,

1207
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:07,060
"That's - my child is born now, finished.

1208
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,070
Whatever is over is over."

1209
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:11,070
That's what is kundalini.

1210
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,140
Why should you have any fear?

1211
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:16,010
This is people who are telling you that

1212
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:18,210
kundalini awakening is very dangerous and all that,

1213
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,130
because they don't know anything about it.

1214
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:23,120
They don't want you to get your realization.

1215
01:26:32,190 --> 01:26:34,100
What he says is true,

1216
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:39,000
that - [Question:"Evil exists from time immemorial,

1217
01:26:39,090 --> 01:26:47,060
in spite of several incarnations and saints."]

1218
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:50,180
It's correct;

1219
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,180
but there is a solution.

1220
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:57,240
So why not seek the solution, to get out of evil?

1221
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:02,120
Once you are a realized soul,

1222
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:05,130
the evil will run away - not you.

1223
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:15,210
The time has come for all the evil to run away,

1224
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:19,130
to be destroyed, to be exposed, to be finished.

1225
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:22,150
It's you who can do it.

1226
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:30,000
Everything takes its own time, like the growth of a tree.

1227
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:35,170
Slowly, slowly all these six chakras were worked out.

1228
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:39,020
Now the question of the seventh chakra, is the Sahasrara,

1229
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:42,010
which is now worked out in Sahaja Yoga.

1230
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,190
So the picture is complete.

1231
01:27:49,210 --> 01:27:56,020
Evil cannot destroy a Sahaja yogi; they know it very well.

1232
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:00,170
Even the evil know that they cannot.

1233
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:05,090
If they see a Sahaja yogi, they run away.

1234
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:11,230
So don't you worry.

1235
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:20,240
I think I have answered all your questions,

1236
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:23,010
most of them;

1237
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,160
but there's one thing.

1238
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:34,060
I've been doing this for the last (how many years?) -

1239
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,200
twenty-three years, twenty-one years,

1240
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:44,090
answering questions.

1241
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:49,010
I'm quite now clever,

1242
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:52,170
I can answer any question, that's true.

1243
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:56,200
But this is no guarantee for your awakening,

1244
01:28:57,030 --> 01:29:00,080
I must tell you. It's a mental acrobat.

1245
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,160
So though I have answered your question,

1246
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:09,060
doesn't mean that I will raise your kundalini,

1247
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:11,090
or kundalini will rise.

1248
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:14,000
That's a separate issue altogether.

1249
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:18,200
But I don't want you to have this mind suddenly

1250
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:22,130
shooting out and saying that you didn't ask this question,

1251
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:25,010
so that you be stressed out. That's why I answer.

1252
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:27,080
Otherwise makes no difference whether I answer

1253
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:29,020
or don't answer.

1254
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:31,170
It's something very different,

1255
01:29:32,190 --> 01:29:34,160
different area.

1256
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:49,030
So now, we are all prepared for our realization.

1257
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:54,120
Those who got yesterday also will get it more.

1258
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:58,230
As I have told you, those who do not want to have it,

1259
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:03,050
I cannot force on you - cannot force.

1260
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:16,090
I think all the Sahaja yogis from the West have to go out -

1261
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:19,230
this time is there, sorry.

1262
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:23,040
I know you want to sit down for meditation,

1263
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:26,020
but you'll be getting much more chances than others;

1264
01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:27,240
because there's time up.

1265
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,070
You have to pack up your things.

1266
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:32,060
All right.

1267
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,200
Look at them, they're singing Sanskrit,

1268
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,150
and it's complete "Ai Giri Nandini" they sing so well.

1269
01:30:39,230 --> 01:30:42,090
Just think of them - can you imagine, these people,

1270
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:44,150
how did they learn?

1271
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:47,060
These are Germans, can you imagine?

1272
01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:50,060
They don't call themselves Germans, no.

1273
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:52,210
How could they do it?

1274
01:30:55,070 --> 01:30:57,180
They didn't know, these English didn't know a word

1275
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:01,020
of Hindi; they lived here for three hundred years,

1276
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:03,070
I don't know what they did.

1277
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:06,110
Even to tell them Darwaza Band Kar (means close the door)

1278
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:09,000
you had to say, "There was a banker."

1279
01:31:09,170 --> 01:31:11,130
Look at them!

1280
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:14,050
All this is the Atma!

1281
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:16,200
How they appreciate your music,

1282
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:20,050
and how they appreciate your Kuchipudi dancing out,

1283
01:31:20,110 --> 01:31:22,200
it's surprising -

1284
01:31:24,050 --> 01:31:26,190
much more than you can.

1285
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:40,070
Because our music comes from Aumkara.

1286
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,090
It will be proved, Brahman.

1287
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:49,190
We should be proud that we are Indians.

1288
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:58,190
Our culture is the highest culture in the whole world.

1289
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:02,130
We must respect our culture and preserve it.

1290
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:06,160
Ask them, they will show you,

1291
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:11,150
they will tell you what they have found in Sahaja Yoga.

1292
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,230
Question about moksha.

1293
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:22,240
This is moksha only?

1294
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:24,130
Of course!

1295
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:27,020
This is what moksha is.

1296
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:37,240
"Moksha" means where you rise about your physical,

1297
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:40,080
mental, emotional being;

1298
01:32:40,190 --> 01:32:43,100
you are no more involved into it.

1299
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:45,160
That is the moksha.

1300
01:32:47,230 --> 01:32:50,120
And by this non-involvement,

1301
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:54,150
all your physical, mental, emotional beings are solved.

1302
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:03,070
You become that, you become the tattwa ,

1303
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:06,150
Tattwamasi you become the tattwa.

1304
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:09,120
"Aham Brahmasmi"- you become the [*]Brahma.

1305
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:12,100
It's all around - this is Brahma.

1306
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:19,080
But even when you become you don't believe,

1307
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:21,070
again I tell you.

1308
01:33:21,170 --> 01:33:23,140
I mean, I don't know what happens,

1309
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:26,000
they don't believe that they are.

1310
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:33,190
All right,

1311
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:38,070
so a simple thing is now is to understand that

1312
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:40,140
it's a living process.

1313
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:45,150
It cannot be forced, it works by itself.

1314
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:50,210
But you all have fundamental right

1315
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:53,220
to get your Self-realization, all of you -

1316
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:56,100
whatever race you may be, whatever religion you may be,

1317
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:59,000
whatever country you may be - you are a human being,

1318
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:01,170
and you all have this right.

1319
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:05,030
I would request you to take out your shoes and

1320
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:08,090
to put your feet on this Mother Earth,

1321
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:18,070
because she sucks in our problems.

1322
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:23,090
Both the...please take out your shoes, chappels,

1323
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:26,090
take out please.

1324
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:32,010
Language - he doesn't understand My language, is it?

1325
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:55,200
Both the feet on the Mother Earth, away from each other.

1326
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:08,120
Now, during meditation please don't move out, that's all.

1327
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:29,140
You'll have to go, I think.

1328
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:33,090
Please, I think you'd better go.

1329
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,030
You are going by plane? ....

1330
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,110
All right.

1331
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:06,120
You are Sahaja yogis, you can do anything.

1332
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,180
The train will wait for you!

1333
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:18,130
They don't want to miss any moment.

1334
01:36:19,130 --> 01:36:21,180
They understand the importance of every moment,

1335
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:23,160
you can imagine.

1336
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:34,110
What you need is sincerity to yourself.

1337
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:40,000
Now you have to put your both feet away from each other,

1338
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:48,030
and have a very pleasant feeling about yourself -

1339
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:52,020
prasanna bhave, prasanna chitt.

1340
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,110
Don't be angry with yourself, with anyone,

1341
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:57,020
just be prasanna.

1342
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:01,000
What a nice word we have in Sanskrit, prasanna.

1343
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:04,140
Put both the feet away from each other like this,

1344
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,160
and have a very nice feeling about yourself,

1345
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:10,040
very pleasant feeling.

1346
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:20,180
First we'll tell you what chakras are to be touched,

1347
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:23,150
and how to raise your kundalini yourself.

1348
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:26,040
But later on you don't have to worry,

1349
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:28,210
later on, because it's very simple.

1350
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:36,000
He will show you how to raise your own kundalini.

1351
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:44,170
You have anything...

1352
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:58,210
(Please try to loosen it.)

1353
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:03,200
Please put the left hand towards Me like this...

1354
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:25,240
All right.

1355
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,140
Left hand towards Me like this.

1356
01:38:28,150 --> 01:38:33,180
That is for absorbing the energy,

1357
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:38,040
or for expression of your desire,

1358
01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:40,120
because left side is the power of desire 

1359
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:43,150
and the right is the power of action.

1360
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:53,070
So put your left hand towards Me like this,

1361
01:38:53,150 --> 01:38:56,140
the expression of your desire

1362
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:59,020
to have your Self-realization.

1363
01:39:01,030 --> 01:39:04,240
Take your right hand on your heart.

1364
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:13,000
As I told you, in the heart is reflected the God Almighty,

1365
01:39:14,030 --> 01:39:15,230
as spirit.

1366
01:39:18,010 --> 01:39:22,230
If you become the spirit, you become your own master.

1367
01:39:24,130 --> 01:39:26,130
So now you take down your right hand -

1368
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:28,130
we are working only on the left-hand side -

1369
01:39:29,190 --> 01:39:37,130
on the left-hand side of your abdomen, on the upper part.

1370
01:39:38,030 --> 01:39:39,170
Press it hard.

1371
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:44,050
This is the center of your mastery.

1372
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:45,050
All right?

1373
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:50,060
Can you hear Me now?

1374
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:56,130
So now, if you are the spirit you become your own master.

1375
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,230
So you put your right hand on the upper portion of

1376
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:02,060
your abdomen on the left-hand side,

1377
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:05,090
and this is the center of your mastery.

1378
01:41:07,070 --> 01:41:09,200
Who's making the noise?

1379
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:14,060
They are able to hear Me?

1380
01:41:14,170 --> 01:41:15,200
No?

1381
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:17,230
No, it's quite loud.

1382
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:20,180
Don't you hear Me?

1383
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:25,130
All right, thank you.

1384
01:41:26,070 --> 01:41:31,190
Now, take down your hand in the lower portion of your

1385
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,120
abdomen, on the left-hand side.

1386
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:44,010
This is the center of pure knowledge.

1387
01:41:45,030 --> 01:41:49,180
That is what works on your nerves,

1388
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:51,150
on your central nervous system,

1389
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:57,150
is manifested by this center of Swadisthana.

1390
01:42:04,170 --> 01:42:06,080
Again you raise your right hand in

1391
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:08,200
the upper portion of your abdomen,

1392
01:42:14,230 --> 01:42:16,220
on the left-hand side.

1393
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:21,200
Then again you'll have to raise your hand on your heart.

1394
01:42:26,130 --> 01:42:30,030
Then raise your hand

1395
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:33,120
in the corner of your neck and shoulder,

1396
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:37,040
and turn your head to your right.

1397
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:48,120
This is the center you catch when you feel guilty,

1398
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,240
and you develop horrible diseases like spondylitis,

1399
01:42:52,070 --> 01:42:54,010
or maybe angina.

1400
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:04,190
So now please put your right hand on top your forehead,

1401
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:10,160
and bend your head.

1402
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:14,130
Here you have to forgive everyone,

1403
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:21,230
without thinking about whom you have to forgive.

1404
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:29,050
Take back your right hand on the back side of your head;

1405
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,110
this is the Agnya,

1406
01:43:30,190 --> 01:43:35,060
front Agnya and the back Agnya - if you know, the optic lobe.

1407
01:43:35,150 --> 01:43:38,060
Press it on both the sides.

1408
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,230
This is just the center because you feel guilty;

1409
01:43:45,150 --> 01:43:49,180
ask forgiveness from the divine Power, that's all.

1410
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:53,020
Push back your head.

1411
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:02,020
Now,

1412
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:07,080
stretch your hand fully,

1413
01:44:07,170 --> 01:44:10,170
and put the center of your palm on top of the

1414
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,080
fontanel bone area, the taloo,

1415
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:20,060
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

1416
01:44:23,070 --> 01:44:25,240
Put down your head as far as possible.

1417
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:30,130
Now press it hard and push back your fingers,

1418
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:38,020
and press it hard and move your scalp,

1419
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:41,240
slowly seven times clockwise.

1420
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:00,220
Now,

1421
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:05,000
that's how we have to do it.

1422
01:45:05,150 --> 01:45:09,200
At the very outset there are three conditions.

1423
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:16,230
First is that you all should feel fully confident

1424
01:45:17,190 --> 01:45:20,230
that you are going to get your Self-realization,

1425
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,220
that you are going to get your Self-realization -

1426
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:26,110
(can you hear Me now?) -

1427
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:29,160
fully confident.

1428
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:33,130
Secondly -

1429
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,170
(can you fix it?) -

1430
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:48,060
second condition is that you should not feel guilty

1431
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:51,040
at all about anything.

1432
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:58,010
Us Indians don't feel so much guilty as the Westerners.

1433
01:46:00,070 --> 01:46:03,070
It's good idea not to feel guilty.

1434
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:09,210
Don't listen to anybody who tells you this is wrong,

1435
01:46:10,020 --> 01:46:12,220
you are like that, you are like that - nothing of the kind.

1436
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:15,220
Nobody has business to judge you.

1437
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:22,020
So please don't feel guilty, very important.

1438
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:28,090
And the third condition is that you have to forgive everyone.

1439
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:33,240
Many of you will say that's difficult, which is wrong.

1440
01:46:34,210 --> 01:46:36,080
As I told you yesterday,

1441
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:38,100
whether you forgive or don't forgive,

1442
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:40,140
you don't do anything.

1443
01:46:43,170 --> 01:46:52,030
So why not forgive anyone - only we play into wrong hands.

1444
01:46:52,170 --> 01:46:56,170
So just, without thinking about whom you have to

1445
01:46:57,010 --> 01:47:02,120
forgive or whom you have to remember,

1446
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:08,040
try just to say in general, "I forgive everyone."

1447
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:11,200
You'll feel much lighter. Just you say that.

1448
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:15,190
That's a myth, you are living with a myth.

1449
01:47:18,090 --> 01:47:20,050
Can you hear Me now? You can.

1450
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:26,050
Can you hear Me, that side? Back side, do you hear Me?

1451
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:42,120
Now, you have to close your eyes.

1452
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:45,030
You can take out your spectacles,

1453
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:47,090
because you should not open your eyes till I tell you.

1454
01:47:47,090 --> 01:47:49,090
Please take out your spectacles.

1455
01:47:49,150 --> 01:47:52,100
If there's anything tight on your neck or in your,

1456
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:56,040
on your waist, please ...

1457
01:47:57,210 --> 01:48:00,230
If you have anything - What's the matter?

1458
01:48:01,090 --> 01:48:04,050
If you have anything - I have to just go on to it,

1459
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:06,020
that's what's just coming -

1460
01:48:06,150 --> 01:48:12,000
anything on your neck or on your waist,

1461
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:14,200
something very tight, you can ...

1462
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:18,140
If you have any tawis or anything, please remove it,

1463
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:20,160
it's not very good.

1464
01:48:22,110 --> 01:48:24,210
Or some mala given by some guru or someone,

1465
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:27,020
please remove it;

1466
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:37,200
because you have not come here

1467
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:40,150
to enslave yourself to anyone,

1468
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:44,200
but to become absolutely free.

1469
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:51,150
So now we close our eyes, all of us.

1470
01:48:53,010 --> 01:48:54,090
Please close your eyes.

1471
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:56,240
Put both the feet on the Mother Earth still,

1472
01:48:57,050 --> 01:49:00,240
don't forget that, you have to put both the feet, yes.

1473
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:06,160
Now, close your eyes fully, don't open them.

1474
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:10,230
Now, put the left hand towards Me on your lap

1475
01:49:11,090 --> 01:49:16,200
and right hand on your heart, right hand on your heart.

1476
01:49:17,010 --> 01:49:20,000
Now left hand open towards Me, open,

1477
01:49:20,110 --> 01:49:22,110
keep it open towards Me.

1478
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:26,040
You can keep it in your ....

1479
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:41,050
Now, in the heart resides the spirit.

1480
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:44,100
You ask Me a question three times,

1481
01:49:45,070 --> 01:49:50,080
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

1482
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:52,200
It's very fundamental question.

1483
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:55,140
Without any diffidence,

1484
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:58,230
please ask this question in your heart three times,

1485
01:49:59,060 --> 01:50:02,000
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

1486
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:08,130
That's a fact: you are the spirit.

1487
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:11,040
That's the truth about you.

1488
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:15,100
Now, take down your right hand in the

1489
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:17,070
upper portion of your abdomen.

1490
01:50:17,150 --> 01:50:21,160
To be Prassana Chitta...You should not be overly serious.

1491
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,220
There is nothing serious, you see.

1492
01:50:24,070 --> 01:50:26,170
Must understand, you should be prasanna chitta.

1493
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:32,230
Forget your past.

1494
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:40,090
Now, here you have to ask another question three times,

1495
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:46,040
"Mother, am I my own master?"

1496
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:48,240
Ask this question three times.

1497
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:56,230
"Am I my own guru?"

1498
01:50:57,050 --> 01:50:59,160
This center is created by the Satgurus

1499
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:02,160
for you to establish yourself.

1500
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:08,110
Now, take down your right hand in the lower portion of

1501
01:51:11,090 --> 01:51:14,140
your abdomen on the left-hand side.

1502
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:23,070
I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

1503
01:51:24,210 --> 01:51:28,040
The rest is all avidya; this is vidya.

1504
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:33,020
Vidya, where it is vida, is knowledge.

1505
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:37,010
So you have to ask six times,

1506
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:42,180
"Mother, please may I have pure knowledge?"

1507
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:55,230
When you ask for pure knowledge,

1508
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:59,060
your kundalini starts rising.

1509
01:52:00,150 --> 01:52:03,040
And now we have to nourish

1510
01:52:03,150 --> 01:52:07,040
our upper centers with our self-confidence.

1511
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:14,040
So now raise your right hand in the upper portion

1512
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:18,070
of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

1513
01:52:31,190 --> 01:52:36,000
And here with full confidence you have to say ten times,

1514
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:39,100
"Mother, I am my own master."

1515
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:41,140
Please say it with full confidence.

1516
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:45,060
Don't doubt yourself; you are your master.

1517
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:49,120
Please put your left hand towards Me,

1518
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:51,140
towards Me.

1519
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:54,150
Many people are not having left hand towards Me.

1520
01:53:06,090 --> 01:53:10,190
I've already told you that the truth about you is that

1521
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:17,160
you are not this body, this mind, these emotions,

1522
01:53:19,170 --> 01:53:21,140
these conditionings,

1523
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,090
this ego;

1524
01:53:23,170 --> 01:53:27,050
but you are the pure spirit.

1525
01:53:29,010 --> 01:53:33,220
So please now raise your right hand on your heart,

1526
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:43,120
and here with full confidence you have to say,

1527
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:47,070
"Mother, I am the pure spirit.

1528
01:53:47,190 --> 01:53:51,160
Mother, I am the shuddha Atma."

1529
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:54,240
Say it with full confidence.

1530
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:21,010
Now, raise little bit properly, you see,

1531
01:54:21,080 --> 01:54:24,220
it should not be very low also, raise it properly,

1532
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:28,210
as if raising your heart.

1533
01:54:29,170 --> 01:54:31,080
Raise it.

1534
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:39,190
This all-pervading Power

1535
01:54:40,190 --> 01:54:46,160
is the power of love,

1536
01:54:47,030 --> 01:54:52,030
is the ocean of knowledge,

1537
01:54:52,170 --> 01:54:56,170
ocean of bliss and compassion.

1538
01:54:57,030 --> 01:55:02,040
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness,

1539
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:05,040
and whatever you think you have done wrong

1540
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:08,160
can be easily dissolved in this great ocean.

1541
01:55:10,130 --> 01:55:14,220
So please raise your right hand in the corner of your neck

1542
01:55:15,070 --> 01:55:17,130
and your shoulder,

1543
01:55:18,110 --> 01:55:20,130
and push it back more.

1544
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:26,020
Here you have to say sixteen times,

1545
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,170
"Mother, I am not guilty."

1546
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,030
Say it sixteen times, please.

1547
01:55:34,140 --> 01:55:39,230
"Mother, I am nirdosh. I'm absolutely nirdosh."

1548
01:55:48,130 --> 01:55:50,120
I have already told you

1549
01:55:50,230 --> 01:55:52,150
that whether you forgive or don't forgive,

1550
01:55:52,210 --> 01:55:56,210
you don't do anything; it's a myth.

1551
01:55:58,180 --> 01:56:03,170
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands

1552
01:56:08,090 --> 01:56:12,000
and torture yourself, while the person who has tortured you

1553
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:14,080
is quite happy.

1554
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:20,150
So now, raise your right hand on your forehead across,

1555
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:24,010
and put down your head.

1556
01:56:26,050 --> 01:56:29,140
Fully put down your head, and here

1557
01:56:33,150 --> 01:56:37,180
you have to say from your heart, not how many times.

1558
01:56:38,170 --> 01:56:40,060
If you don't say it,

1559
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:45,180
I cannot make your kundalini pass through this constricted

1560
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:47,120
Agnya Chakra.

1561
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:49,210
So please, all of you should say,

1562
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:55,050
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general,"

1563
01:56:55,170 --> 01:57:00,130
not thinking about anyone in particular, please.

1564
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:17,150
Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head.

1565
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:27,050
Push back your head, as far as possible.

1566
01:57:29,050 --> 01:57:31,180
Without feeling guilty,

1567
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:38,190
without counting your mistakes,

1568
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:43,230
just for your satisfaction you have to say,

1569
01:57:44,110 --> 01:57:46,110
"Oh divine Power,

1570
01:57:46,220 --> 01:57:50,120
please forgive me if I have done anything wrong.

1571
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:57,070
Oh Brahmachaitanya, please forgive me if I have done

1572
01:57:57,150 --> 01:58:00,020
anything wrong, knowingly or unknowingly."

1573
01:58:00,210 --> 01:58:06,210
This you have to say in your heart,

1574
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:09,240
not how many times.

1575
01:58:17,150 --> 01:58:19,160
Now,

1576
01:58:24,110 --> 01:58:28,080
stretch your right hand.

1577
01:58:30,110 --> 01:58:35,140
Put the center of your palm of right hand

1578
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:39,150
on top of the fontanel bone area,

1579
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,030
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

1580
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:49,040
Push back your fingers as far as possible.

1581
01:58:50,070 --> 01:58:54,070
Put down your head as far as possible.

1582
01:58:56,050 --> 01:58:58,050
Here again,

1583
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:04,130
I cannot force Self-realization on you,

1584
01:59:05,210 --> 01:59:08,030
so you have to ask for it.

1585
01:59:09,170 --> 01:59:13,220
Move your scalp seven times clockwise,

1586
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:19,150
saying, "Mother, please give me my Self-realization."

1587
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:22,070
Seven times, please.

1588
01:59:24,010 --> 01:59:26,140
Don't move the hand so much as the scalp.

1589
01:59:26,210 --> 01:59:28,230
Please press it hard. Push back your fingers.

1590
01:59:29,060 --> 01:59:30,210
First is, unless until you push back fingers,

1591
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:33,070
there won't be any pressure.

1592
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:31,220
Now take down your hands, please.

1593
02:00:35,050 --> 02:00:37,140
Put both the hands towards Me.

1594
02:00:39,170 --> 02:00:42,140
Now watch Me without thinking.

1595
02:00:50,130 --> 02:00:52,240
Now put your right hand towards Me,

1596
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:55,240
and bend your head and see for yourself.

1597
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:57,190
Don't watch others, watch yourself.

1598
02:00:58,040 --> 02:01:01,030
See if there's a cool breeze coming out of your

1599
02:01:01,130 --> 02:01:02,220
fontanel bone area,

1600
02:01:03,050 --> 02:01:06,160
see if there's a cool breeze coming out of your

1601
02:01:06,220 --> 02:01:08,080
fontanel bone area.

1602
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:12,220
There might be a hot breeze also;

1603
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:15,090
if you have not forgiven, specially,

1604
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:17,180
then the hot breeze might be there.

1605
02:01:18,150 --> 02:01:21,000
So now you forgive.

1606
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:26,200
Now, take your left hand towards Me like this.

1607
02:01:27,070 --> 02:01:29,070
Again put down your head.

1608
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:31,240
Not on top, but away from it;

1609
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:34,020
some people get it very far also.

1610
02:01:34,130 --> 02:01:37,110
Try to see if there's a cool breeze

1611
02:01:37,190 --> 02:01:41,100
or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

1612
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:45,200
On the fontanel, not very far backward and forward,

1613
02:01:46,030 --> 02:01:49,120
but on the fontanel, on the taloo.

1614
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:56,000
All right?

1615
02:01:56,110 --> 02:01:59,230
Again, put your right hand towards Me.

1616
02:02:00,130 --> 02:02:04,100
Ha! Bend your head, bend your head.

1617
02:02:07,180 --> 02:02:09,130
That's it!

1618
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:12,040
Now,

1619
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:16,070
I have to tell you how to give yourself the Kavach

1620
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:17,220
to protect yourself,

1621
02:02:18,050 --> 02:02:19,190
it's very important;

1622
02:02:20,060 --> 02:02:22,030
and how to raise your kundalini,

1623
02:02:22,110 --> 02:02:25,230
it's very important, very simple - he'll show you also.

1624
02:02:26,190 --> 02:02:29,140
Put your left hand like this in front of you,

1625
02:02:30,050 --> 02:02:31,140
and the right hand you have to move,

1626
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:33,190
the left hand goes straight.

1627
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:37,000
So you have to - I'll just show you first of all, like this.

1628
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:43,110
It goes up onto your head, and here you give it one knot.

1629
02:02:45,010 --> 02:02:47,110
Now, again we'll start now, properly.

1630
02:02:48,030 --> 02:02:50,030
We start it from here.

1631
02:02:50,090 --> 02:02:53,130
Now start moving your left hand upward.

1632
02:02:54,090 --> 02:02:56,230
For fixing up your kundalini,

1633
02:02:57,070 --> 02:03:00,230
put your hand up and give it one knot;

1634
02:03:02,190 --> 02:03:05,010
then again, the second one.

1635
02:03:09,140 --> 02:03:11,230
Give it the second knot.

1636
02:03:12,090 --> 02:03:14,100
Third knot you have to give three times.

1637
02:03:14,180 --> 02:03:16,240
Now again do it, please:

1638
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:26,210
one, it's two,

1639
02:03:28,030 --> 02:03:32,210
and three. Done! Now the Kavach.

1640
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:36,130
You have to take for your protection every morning

1641
02:03:36,210 --> 02:03:40,050
when you go out, and before sleeping you should

1642
02:03:40,110 --> 02:03:42,060
put your attention here and sleep off.

1643
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:45,080
Put the left hand towards Me like this.

1644
02:03:49,010 --> 02:03:51,070
It is Saadhe teen...

1645
02:03:52,010 --> 02:03:55,230
the three-and-a half coils.

1646
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:58,100
So how do you give Kavach?

1647
02:03:58,180 --> 02:04:02,010
It's, put left hand towards Me, towards the photograph,

1648
02:04:02,100 --> 02:04:04,120
put the right hand like this -

1649
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:06,090
I'll show you first of all.

1650
02:04:06,170 --> 02:04:11,110
Then raise it like this, bring it down - this is half.

1651
02:04:12,170 --> 02:04:17,040
Then again you take it back - this is one.

1652
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:25,040
Again you take it up, is again you take it back - is two.

1653
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:30,020
Again you take it like this,

1654
02:04:31,190 --> 02:04:34,020
again you bring it back - is three.

1655
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:36,100
And now you take it back only halfway,

1656
02:04:36,180 --> 02:04:39,010
so three-and-a-half times.

1657
02:04:42,110 --> 02:04:45,160
This is bandhan, is the Kavach,

1658
02:04:46,090 --> 02:04:49,010
Kavach of protection.

1659
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,180
Also lots of things you'll learn,

1660
02:04:53,030 --> 02:04:55,120
how to use this power from your hand.

1661
02:04:55,190 --> 02:04:57,220
Now, all those who have felt

1662
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:01,170
cool or hot breeze in their hands

1663
02:05:02,010 --> 02:05:05,040
or out of your fontanel bone area,

1664
02:05:06,070 --> 02:05:08,030
please raise your both hands.

1665
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:12,010
All those who have felt, please raise both your hands.

1666
02:05:15,050 --> 02:05:17,210
They have a little problem of liver, but it will work out,

1667
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:20,100
it doesn't matter.

1668
02:05:21,170 --> 02:05:23,090
May God bless you all,

1669
02:05:23,170 --> 02:05:25,200
may God bless you.

1670
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:36,180
So Madras should become now Mada Raas,

1671
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:39,180
means all the Mada (vanity) is finished

1672
02:05:42,110 --> 02:05:44,240
and achieve that state.

1673
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:49,040
May God bless you all. Again and again I tell you,

1674
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:54,070
be humble and come to the center.

1675
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:57,190
There are some very good Sahaja yogis in the center.

1676
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:02,110
They'll all tell you everything with very loving way.

1677
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:07,190
But please come, and pay attention to yourself,

1678
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:12,000
and know everything.

1679
02:06:12,110 --> 02:06:15,210
Next year I will come again to Madras.

1680
02:06:17,060 --> 02:06:19,170
May God bless you.
