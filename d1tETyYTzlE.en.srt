1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,809
today we have assembled here

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,200
to a sheep say Ganesha

3
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:27,990
Shri Ganesha who is the lord of

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,990
innocence

5
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:56,710
he is the ocean of analysis and though

6
00:00:42,770 --> 00:01:06,610
he is such a young little boy he can

7
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:13,150
fight the whole world he can destroy all

8
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:16,150
the negatory that's the sign of

9
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,150
innocence

10
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:26,890
there have been stories that children

11
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:31,960
who have fallen from very early tide

12
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,960
they are completely saved nothing about

13
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:49,010
their innocence it's such a powerful

14
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:55,550
thing that it doesn't harm anyone who is

15
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:59,600
not to be harmed it has all the wisdom

16
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:07,790
of the world all the understanding of

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:14,620
the world and anybody who tries to harm

18
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:19,340
the innocence the world the whole world

19
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:23,030
which has made me not have cared so much

20
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:27,280
for innocence might not have worshipped

21
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:33,080
innocence so much but they all stand

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:43,280
stand up against anybody who tries to

23
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:48,950
harm the innocence you can see in your

24
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:54,440
own lies around you anybody tries to

25
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:58,239
trouble children all of them whatever

26
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:02,270
they are whatever they are coming from

27
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:07,970
whatever may be their nationality they

28
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:14,840
all jump all jump to control and to

29
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:18,380
safeguard that Charlie what is it what

30
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:26,620
is it within us that makes us so very

31
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:26,620
conscious to protect the innocence

32
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:39,300
it's a really think great shame for us

33
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:46,250
when we find in this world that

34
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:46,250
innocence is under attack anything else

35
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:54,350
can be tolerated innocent people who

36
00:03:52,290 --> 00:04:04,800
have done nothing wrong

37
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:11,220
those who have no malice who are living

38
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:18,690
like little children I should say if

39
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:27,510
they are attacked by you not that the

40
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:35,930
whole world reacts God but every one of

41
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:41,460
them cannot bear any innocent person or

42
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:50,160
innocent being being harmed we don't

43
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:57,440
realize that within us there is the

44
00:04:50,160 --> 00:05:04,110
ocean of love and ocean of understanding

45
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:07,320
for children why why should it be why

46
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:14,040
should we feel like that especially for

47
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:17,310
children especially for innocence there

48
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:23,060
are people who are always attacking

49
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:25,650
innocent people in ascension there are

50
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:31,060
but

51
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:35,560
no one wants to support them no one

52
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:40,410
thinks that's proper to ill-treat

53
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:44,680
children and those who have done this

54
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:50,050
have to suffer they all suffer as a

55
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:52,570
reaction what is it within us that

56
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:59,169
creates that reaction that tremendous

57
00:05:52,570 --> 00:06:02,889
reaction against innocence for example

58
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:07,320
if there is a regular war and if there

59
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:12,160
are people fighting in a regular war

60
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:15,460
they don't have much sympathy in the

61
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,979
world also they say all right we're of

62
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,009
that understanding they are of that kind

63
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:28,000
of thing the greatest sympathy comes

64
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:31,240
when innocent is being cherished that's

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,620
what human beings have within themselves

66
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:43,560
they have the power power of Shri

67
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:50,430
Ganesha nature gives you that feeling

68
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:56,620
that capacity that understanding that

69
00:06:50,430 --> 00:07:01,750
you have to protect innocent innocent

70
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:05,590
children innocent people and the whole

71
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:10,050
world can rise against all such people

72
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:18,659
who are trying to kill the innocent

73
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:24,340
there cannot be any doubt if they cannot

74
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:27,849
oppose such an attack or criticize such

75
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:31,080
a thing then they are not yet human

76
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:31,080
beings I would say

77
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:45,980
the highest personality can sacrifice

78
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:50,070
anything and can give up anything but

79
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:52,820
they cannot give up the feeling they

80
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:56,700
have her innocence

81
00:07:52,820 --> 00:08:02,060
it is very remarkable we don't realize

82
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:07,640
how much there is this ocean of

83
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:12,830
protection and love for the innocent

84
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:19,920
what attracts the greatest strength is

85
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:24,390
when we see an innocent person innocent

86
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:29,250
children are under attack that's the

87
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:31,400
beauty of human beings of course there

88
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:34,170
are many human beings who can be cruel

89
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:38,640
who are I would say I call them devils

90
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:45,540
maybe maybe but when it comes to

91
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:54,690
children and to innocent people everyone

92
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:58,340
feels is a responsibility it's difficult

93
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:05,540
for normal human beings to be innocent

94
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:11,060
because they have kind of a

95
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:13,040
understanding that they are something

96
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,519
great

97
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,790
that they understand everything that

98
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:22,810
they can analyze everything and they

99
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:27,050
could be crooks they could be aggressive

100
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:30,529
they could be troublesome they could be

101
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:35,899
anything and they can give explanation

102
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:40,190
for that in math but still on the whole

103
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:46,819
they can never be respected and they can

104
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:50,959
never be honored for the thing that for

105
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:55,699
us the sahaja Yogi's the search culture

106
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:58,519
is to respect your innocence you might

107
00:09:55,699 --> 00:10:02,600
feel a little bit cheated you might feel

108
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:07,310
a little bit dominated we might feel it

109
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:10,759
to be disgraced but sahaja Yogi's I have

110
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:14,959
to be innocent because with them lies

111
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:20,649
the power of Shri Ganesha they should

112
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:28,029
not feel dejected if they are being used

113
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:31,910
insulted tortured dominated for Allah

114
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:37,540
they should not try to destroy the

115
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:37,540
innocence of other people of anyone

116
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:48,430
automatically it will work will be

117
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:53,120
amazed that when innocence is charged

118
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:57,350
all the goodness of the world comes to

119
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:02,980
the rescue of that example of this is

120
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:06,740
the recent war so-called war of America

121
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:08,290
where innocent people they have done

122
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:14,930
nothing wrong

123
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:22,580
have been tortured have been killed at

124
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:27,800
that time all over the world is a big

125
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:33,170
support worthy every country whether it

126
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:40,850
believes in those people or not is

127
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:44,240
anxious to look after those who have

128
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:47,360
done this crime they may not be

129
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,510
belonging to the same religion they may

130
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,100
not be belonging to the same country

131
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:58,010
they may not be belonging to the same

132
00:11:52,100 --> 00:12:01,640
crimes but at this moment who does not

133
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:05,630
take the side of the innocence will be

134
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:10,220
singled out and will be destroyed no

135
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:14,029
doubt about once for all they will learn

136
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:19,790
a lesson that you cannot attack innocent

137
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:23,149
leader I have told you in sahaja yoga we

138
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:28,399
should not ever be annoyed with our

139
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:30,130
children we should not in no way punish

140
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:38,300
them

141
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:42,500
our main achievement should be that

142
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:47,180
loving attention for children all over

143
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:51,290
the world where he belongs to your

144
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:54,160
family or to some another family or has

145
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,160
some sort of

146
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:07,970
detached attention with you still

147
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:13,560
because he is a child he is innocent

148
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:19,560
the innocence within itself your own

149
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:24,090
innocence will try to protect it's very

150
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:28,950
surprising how people take to

151
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:35,700
sacrificing their lives when it comes to

152
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:40,380
the attack of innocence children should

153
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:43,740
never be attacked they have their own

154
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:46,620
power to protect no doubt but you

155
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:54,300
shouldn't waste your energy on something

156
00:13:46,620 --> 00:14:00,710
that is extremely inauspicious extremely

157
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:00,710
cruel and extremely ugly

158
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:10,890
if you cannot love children you cannot

159
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:13,680
love anything else not come across

160
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:18,330
anyone so far who says that they don't

161
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:22,950
love to do it luckily but maybe some

162
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:27,110
might say we love flowers why why you

163
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:30,450
love flowers because they are innocent

164
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:34,410
because that beauty of innocence is

165
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:37,560
within them we love nature why because

166
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:43,350
it is innocent but the greatest

167
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:48,110
innocence is seen among human beings who

168
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:48,110
are sahaja Yogi's
