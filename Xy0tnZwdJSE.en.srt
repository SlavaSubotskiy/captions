00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,420
Shri Ganesha Puja. Nasik (India), 18 January 1983.

2
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:10,557
It is such a fortunate day today,

3
00:00:10,757 --> 00:00:15,557
that we should come on the birth of Shri Ganesha

4
00:00:15,757 --> 00:00:18,437
– today is Vinayak Chaturthi, today -

5
00:00:18,717 --> 00:00:23,757
that we should celebrate this Puja.

6
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:29,397
Also, it is so fortunate to have people like

7
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:35,517
Dr Sanghvi, his wife and his son, his daughter-in-law,

8
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:41,037
who are so much dedicated to Sahaja Yoga.

9
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:47,957
In 1972 I had visited Pune, Nasik,

10
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:51,797
and we had a big session here.

11
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:56,717
People from all over came; we got a lot of Sahaja yogis here.

12
00:00:57,037 --> 00:00:59,397
Raulbai is one of them.

13
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:05,317
But the people of Nasik did not come forward much to do Sahaja Yoga,

14
00:01:05,637 --> 00:01:09,797
and sort of, we didn’t find any

15
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:16,157
footing place here, so we gave up coming to Nasik.

16
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:21,277
And today after so many days, now I’m back here.

17
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:27,997
And it’s so surprising how we have been able to manage.

18
00:01:29,997 --> 00:01:31,637
So many people yesterday, about,

19
00:01:31,837 --> 00:01:35,677
they are saying about ten thousand people were present.

20
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:38,397
And at least, I would say that ninety percent people

21
00:01:38,637 --> 00:01:42,637
got Realization, at least.

22
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:49,917
Now, I have to say that the quality of people is very important,

23
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:55,957
and in Maharashtra you must understand that there’s a quality.

24
00:01:56,237 --> 00:02:00,797
These people have a special quality of purity, I think,

25
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,517
that invariably

26
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,997
I’ve seen the amount of working it takes place in Maharashtra,

27
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:10,357
doesn’t take place in other place.

28
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:14,317
Perhaps the people are very much aware

29
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:18,317
of the three and a half peethas they have here.

30
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:24,037
Now for, they are Jains and have been following Jainism but

31
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:27,637
still they always worshipped the Goddess, the Devi.

32
00:02:27,877 --> 00:02:33,077
So, we can understand that what is an impact

33
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:37,117
of those three and a half peethas is.

34
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:39,317
And you have visited

35
00:02:39,597 --> 00:02:44,757
the great shrine of Chaturshringi.

36
00:02:46,397 --> 00:02:47,237
Saptashringi.

37
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:50,957
I’m sorry, Saptashringi. [Hindi/Marathi]

38
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:52,917
Today being Ganesha’s day,

39
00:02:53,117 --> 00:02:56,317
only it is going to come "chatura" in My mouth.

40
00:02:56,757 --> 00:02:58,597
So this Saptashringi is the one

41
00:02:58,797 --> 00:03:02,357
who has got seven chakras, means the limbic area,

42
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:05,517
and She is the Sahasrara, representing the Sahasrara.

43
00:03:05,757 --> 00:03:09,357
That’s why she’s the Ardha-Matra.

44
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:13,677
And Her face and body and all that you can see,

45
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:16,437
is so beautifully made,

46
00:03:16,677 --> 00:03:21,557
that it emits vibrations for miles together.

47
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:25,077
Those who are sensitive can feel it.

48
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:31,597
And you have been so lucky to go there and see that

49
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:35,677
miraculous place, that this have come out of Mother Earth.

50
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:37,917
And since ancient times it has been there.

51
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,637
Nobody knows when it appeared.

52
00:03:44,117 --> 00:03:47,077
So we are in a very holy place,

53
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:53,117
because as you know Sita lived here for so many years

54
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:58,397
and Shri Rama was also with Her, and also Shri Lakshmana.

55
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:04,317
So it is obvious that this is a big kind of,

56
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:06,957
we can say a,

57
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:11,877
quite a big meeting place of various holy things,

58
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:17,957
that happened during the different periods of Maharashtra.

59
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:25,437
And the River Godavari also flows and the, also the

60
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:31,837
[Hindi/Marathi] source, source of this river is also very near.

61
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:33,877
Actually they wanted to take you down there,

62
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:37,037
but it’s another high climb and I thought you will be all exhausted

63
00:04:37,237 --> 00:04:39,397
so I told her better not take that way.

64
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:43,637
But normally those people who come to Nasik always go there.

65
00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:47,237
And there is one sad incident was that

66
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:50,717
there’s a Trimbakeshwar where is there is one of the Jyotirlingas.

67
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:53,197
There are twelve Jyotirlingas.

68
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:56,877
Actually we should say they are fourteen because

69
00:04:57,077 --> 00:04:59,197
two of them are half, so .…

70
00:04:59,397 --> 00:05:03,277
There are twelve Jyotirlingas,

71
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:09,717
and the complete are ten.

72
00:05:09,957 --> 00:05:12,957
Out of them, one of them is here.

73
00:05:13,157 --> 00:05:15,437
But the gentleman was quite funny and he said that

74
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:19,357
"Those who are not Hindus, we cannot admit there".

75
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:20,677
So it’s again

76
00:05:20,877 --> 00:05:24,237
all nonsense going on which will all stop one day, I’m sure,

77
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:28,957
because they have no sense how to recognize the saints, you see.

78
00:05:29,197 --> 00:05:33,877
And once they start recognizing the saints, they will know that

79
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:36,597
they are the first who should go inside,

80
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:38,917
than those who are not realized.

81
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:43,077
Moreover, for Shiva doesn’t matter whether they are even bhoots,

82
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:47,197
doesn’t matter to Him. His temple need not be so guarded.

83
00:05:47,397 --> 00:05:50,357
Any other temple I can understand, but Shiva’s I can’t understand

84
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:52,437
why there is so much guarding is needed.

85
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:56,077
But I think it’s a money-making proposition.

86
00:05:56,317 --> 00:06:00,397
Whatever it is, it brings to My notice

87
00:06:00,637 --> 00:06:04,437
all these nonsensical things that are going on in this country.

88
00:06:04,757 --> 00:06:08,197
And then one starts realizing

89
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:12,157
that how much people have to open out themselves and give up fear

90
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:15,357
from people who are coming from other countries.

91
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:19,757
They suffer all of them, not only,

92
00:06:19,957 --> 00:06:22,677
not only the people

93
00:06:22,877 --> 00:06:26,437
who are religious but also people who are political, social.

94
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:31,157
They are all frightened of foreigners coming in now,

95
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:34,917
in the country, and they always start doubting.

96
00:06:35,157 --> 00:06:38,757
And you can understand that’s why they doubt, but still

97
00:06:38,957 --> 00:06:43,357
they should also understand that in these advanced stages

98
00:06:43,597 --> 00:06:46,437
if there are saints, they should be able to recognize,

99
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:48,997
and this is what’s lacking in them.

100
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:51,797
And I was sad on that point, but doesn’t matter.

101
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:55,757
I think next time I’ll put him right, this gentleman.

102
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:59,797
So, on the whole, our whole stay was,

103
00:06:59,997 --> 00:07:03,197
I think was very interesting and nice, and this evening

104
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:08,637
we are going to have a very beautiful musical program,

105
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:13,917
variety entertainment and classical music by children,

106
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:17,357
which you, I’m sure you’ll all enjoy very much.

107
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:19,317
That we’ll have here.

108
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:23,437
So on the whole we should be thankful to Mr. Sanghvi

109
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:27,157
and to Mr. Mehtani for organizing

110
00:07:27,357 --> 00:07:30,797
this stay in Nasik so well

111
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:33,717
and with such comfort to all of us,

112
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:38,837
and such elevating experiences which has brought you

113
00:07:39,037 --> 00:07:44,437
to something higher, and the experience of your own depth.

114
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:48,877
So may God bless you all.

115
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:10,637
[Hindi/Marathi]

116
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:13,917
[Hindi/Marathi]

117
00:08:14,157 --> 00:08:17,437
They have to first ask for forgiveness of all of you,

118
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:19,877
and they are asking My forgiveness also.

please forgive us,our whole family.”

First you have to worship yourself. Otherwise …

129
00:10:32,997 --> 00:10:35,277
that’s why she has to worship herself,

130
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:38,957
that she should make herself, cleanse herself,

131
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:42,077
and she should worship herself, she should have respect for herself,

132
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:44,037
and she is worshipping Me.

133
00:10:44,237 --> 00:10:45,877
If you are not a respectable person

134
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:49,437
you are not supposed to worship Me.

This is our offer to the Devi

311
00:45:33,757 --> 00:45:38,917
so that the disease of hunger should be eradicated.

312
00:46:41,437 --> 00:46:46,437
This is the worship of the deepa

313
00:46:47,357 --> 00:46:51,397
suggesting that “Oh Mother, we need not,

314
00:46:51,637 --> 00:46:57,117
we should not forget the Spirit, the light of Spirit within us,

315
00:46:57,957 --> 00:47:03,877
and we worship You with this light, so that our attention

316
00:47:04,117 --> 00:47:08,037
should be on that light which is the Spirit within us.

317
00:47:08,277 --> 00:47:11,157
And then they are praying, saying that

318
00:47:11,397 --> 00:47:15,997
“Remove the great darkness of moha.”

319
00:47:16,277 --> 00:47:18,357
“Moha” is attachment.

320
00:47:18,597 --> 00:47:20,957
Attachment.Ahamkar.

321
00:47:21,277 --> 00:47:23,637
And remove the, and “moha” means the attachment.

322
00:47:23,837 --> 00:47:26,437
- SY: Attachments.
- SM: Ahamkar. Aham attachments.

323
00:47:26,637 --> 00:47:28,117
Ahamkar, [Hindi/Marathi].

324
00:47:28,317 --> 00:47:31,757

[Hindi/Marathi]

327
00:48:31,997 --> 00:48:39,117
Now by doing karmas, our brains have muddled up.

328
00:48:39,837 --> 00:48:42,677
So Goddess, we offer You this dhupa

329
00:48:43,037 --> 00:48:48,317
so that You remove the enemy of karma in our head,

330
00:48:48,837 --> 00:48:51,357
remove all of the karmas from our head

331
00:48:51,557 --> 00:48:53,437
so that we are clarified, we give dhupa.

332
00:48:53,637 --> 00:48:56,597
Now, see, it’s so interesting that

333
00:48:56,997 --> 00:49:00,237
what they are suggesting is dhupam,

334
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:05,437
is the, dhupam is given to Shri Krishna,

335
00:49:05,757 --> 00:49:09,877
who is the one who gives us the witness state.

336
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:14,517
So how it is connected. Deepam is the Spirit,

337
00:49:14,917 --> 00:49:18,277
so you see how it is connected. The whole thing is so connected.

341
00:50:27,997 --> 00:50:33,517
Now, it is so significant that a coconut is offered for moksha.

342
00:50:33,757 --> 00:50:36,797
Now, you know, coconut has a limbic area inside it.

343
00:50:36,997 --> 00:50:39,157
It has the three shells,

344
00:50:39,357 --> 00:50:42,597
just like your brain has, and inside is the limbic area.

345
00:50:42,797 --> 00:50:45,957
It represents the limbic area, and that’s why

346
00:50:46,157 --> 00:50:50,637
for moksha you have to go into the limbic area and that’s why

347
00:50:50,917 --> 00:50:56,077
a, is called as “shripala”, Holy Ghost, you see,

348
00:50:56,317 --> 00:50:58,597
the pala of the Holy Ghost, you see,

349
00:50:58,797 --> 00:51:01,797
the fruit that is liked, or representing Her.

350
00:51:01,997 --> 00:51:05,557
This is your limbic area, and that’s why it is given to the Mother.

351
00:51:05,757 --> 00:51:09,677
How significant, and how absolutely appropriate it is.

352
00:51:09,877 --> 00:51:14,157
God has also created this, just to suggest that thing.

which is the Ganesha Tattwa, and that is Agama Shastras,

365
00:52:42,437 --> 00:52:44,917
means the shastras which have come out of that.

366
00:52:45,117 --> 00:52:47,437
So “make me a virtuous personality”.

367
00:52:47,757 --> 00:52:50,677
All has come from Shri Ganesha,

368

and Shri Ganesha makes you auspicious and also virtuous.

369
00:52:55,517 --> 00:52:58,717
"So the one from where all the shastras have come out,

370
00:52:58,957 --> 00:53:02,117
so this is the Shri Ganesha Tattwa which we offer You,

371
00:53:02,317 --> 00:53:05,157
so that You also make us virtuous

372

See, it has an effect on the Mooladhara.

379

SY: [Hindi/Marathi]
SM: So this is for you people, the Ganesha,

Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, seven times with her.

392
00:57:56,437 --> 00:58:00,077
Gavin, why have you dropped “Shri Mataji”?

393
00:58:02,157 --> 00:58:04,437
You should put “Shri Mataji” essentially

394
00:58:04,757 --> 00:58:08,877
because that’s the first name of the Sahasranama, all right?

395
00:58:09,077 --> 00:58:12,157
Should be there, “Shri Mataji”.

396
00:58:12,677 --> 00:58:16,757
When you are standardizing the thing - who has done this?

397
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,917
– you must ask Me;

398
00:58:21,677 --> 00:58:25,397
Because that’s the biggest part, is that I am the Mother, isn’t it?

399

[Hindi/Marathi]

400
00:58:27,397 --> 00:58:31,237
And that is actually the name given by the modern people,

401
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:35,677
so it must be accepted. Is an additional thing.

402
00:58:39,157 --> 00:58:43,917
When you are standardizing the things, you must ask Me, all of you.

403
00:58:44,117 --> 00:58:48,557
I don’t know who has done it, but whosoever it is.

I wish you could all remember by heart,

459
01:08:18,157 --> 01:08:21,877
so that it’s a very nice way of getting rid

460
01:08:22,077 --> 01:08:29,357
of our six types of enemies.

461
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:43,197
You also don’t know what to ask God.

462
01:08:43,397 --> 01:08:47,317
You are always asking for something which is not important.

463
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,717
Our priorities are all wrong.

464
01:08:51,117 --> 01:08:54,397
So this is a very good way of knowing exactly

465
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:58,677

Mr. Sanghvi said that he would not accept any money

from the people for Puja. I said, “But they must all join in”.

470
01:09:37,437 --> 01:09:42,357
So with great difficulty they agreed that we should collect

471
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:48,197
eleven rupees from all of you for the Puja,

472
01:09:48,677 --> 01:09:51,637
and somebody should do it.

473
01:09:51,837 --> 01:09:52,957
Twenty one.

474
01:09:53,157 --> 01:09:57,197
