1
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:32,500
May God bless you all.

2
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:36,346
And all the blessings of Lakshmi,
all the Ashta Lakshmis upon you.

3
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:38,852
May God bless you.

4
00:04:57,546 --> 00:05:01,150
I want to see all of them.

5
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:10,699
In the night I need it,
not in the day time.

6
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:54,794
Today we have come here to celebrate
a great festival of Deepavali,

7
00:05:54,819 --> 00:06:02,607
meaning the rows of lights,
or the festival of lights.

8
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:05,734
Somebody has to translate.

9
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:27,913
It was to celebrate the coronation
of Shri Rama also,

10
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:40,907
that is to say symbolically to celebrate
the establishment of a kingdom

11
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:46,657
which has a benevolent
administration.

12
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:06,342
Today I find all of you here
as the lights sitting before Me.

13
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:16,267
And with these lights I feel
the Deepawali really celebrated,

14
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:21,462
I see the twingling of those eyes,
twinkling in the eye

15
00:07:21,487 --> 00:07:25,697
of that light which is within you.

16
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:44,946
In the lamp of light we have to put
something that is soft, like ghee,

17
00:07:44,971 --> 00:07:52,996
that’s something very mild and soft,
is the love of our heart.

18
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:14,976
And that burns to give this soothing
light of love to others.

19
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:28,319
Such a person who has this light
of love, loves himself as well,

20
00:08:28,344 --> 00:08:32,519
and emits love for others.

21
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:47,681
I’ve been hearing about the way people
used to torture themselves

22
00:08:47,706 --> 00:08:50,423
to become saintly.

23
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:04,598
There’s no need at all for sahaja yogis
- at all - to torture themselves.

24
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:16,846
But to be the light of a higher
magnitude,

25
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:22,984
they have to be full of love.

26
00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:35,863
And this love they get it
from where?

27
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,903
You may say it is from Me,

28
00:09:43,343 --> 00:09:49,338
is true, but the sap of the tree
flows all over,

29
00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:58,756
and all the tree must live
together.

30
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:06,010
Any leaf that wants to separate itself
will die out.

31
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:15,393
So is the collectivity which is going
to make you grow.

32
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:23,864
Any ideas which you have of keeping
yourself out,

33
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:31,964
or preserving yourself out, or having
your houses separate

34
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:36,767
from the collectivity, may be
dangerous.

35
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:58,209
The houses may be separate, but they must
be the houses of all the sahaja yogis.

36
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:07,919
Anybody who comes to your house,
who is a sahaja yogi,

37
00:11:07,944 --> 00:11:12,482
is owner of that house.

38
00:11:20,797 --> 00:11:25,103
That sort of a feeling should be
developed,

39
00:11:29,252 --> 00:11:34,703
when the light you take out from
one room to another room,

40
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:38,111
it does not say: “This is my room
so I give light,

41
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:41,645
if I go to another room I will not
give light.”

42
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:56,611
Now, light is absolutely detached.

43
00:11:59,476 --> 00:12:04,739
If you do not look after your light,
it will extinguish.

44
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:14,966
You have to look after it till it takes
its proper stand.

45
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:23,854
And once it takes a particular
stand,

46
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:29,200
then you are a strong sahaja
yogi.

47
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:40,934
Then they see the light
on your face.

48
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:47,086
And then you manifest light
in their lives.

49
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:54,792
This light, if you put finger on it,
it will burn.

50
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:04,002
But the light of love never
burns.

51
00:13:05,896 --> 00:13:09,313
It dissolves all that is bad.

52
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:18,195
It rejects, it turns away from whatever
that is wrong.

53
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:26,096
It has patience

54
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:32,401
and it expels the darkness.

55
00:13:39,534 --> 00:13:42,970
Darkness within and without.

56
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:50,995
Diwali day is specially meant
to celebrate with the lights,

57
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,951
on a day when Lakshmi
was born.

58
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:09,438
Now this Lakshmi came out
of the sea,

59
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:19,549
and even today there’s lot of Lakshmi
lying under the beds of the sea.

60
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:36,225
But when you do not understand
the real significance of Lakshmi,

61
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:43,349
then it brings darkness

62
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:47,843
and Lakshmi disappears.

63
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:53,215
For example, somebody gets
lots of money:

64
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,501
immediately he will have his first-class
bar in the house.

65
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:11,399
Then he’ll have his friends to come
and have drinks.

66
00:15:14,354 --> 00:15:17,174
He’ll drink with them

67
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,829
and suddenly find that Lakshmi
has disappeared.

68
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:33,146
So wherever there is wine,
there is darkness.

69
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:45,038
And that darkness which comes to you
with the Lakshmi,

70
00:15:45,063 --> 00:15:49,345
makes Lakshmi just disappear.

71
00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:00,043
The whole of the universe, the whole
cosmos is so well-knit

72
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:06,640
that if you try to do one thing wrong
this side, everything goes off.

73
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:23,247
It is so well connected, like one bulb
fuses everything fuses off.

74
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:38,320
In Sahaja Yoga also, it happens
like this,

75
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:44,746
that a person who is enlightened,
and tries to be nasty,

76
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:50,239
tries to create problems, can make
others negative.

77
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:09,950
In the beginning it used to happen
very often,

78
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:17,620
like one bad apple can spoil
all the good apples.

79
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:28,813
But one bad apple cannot be corrected
by all the good apples.

80
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:38,777
One Hitler could make many
Hitlers,

81
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:46,198
but in Sahaja Yoga when you are
grown up and established,

82
00:17:46,223 --> 00:17:53,987
then one bad man if comes, either he has
to run away or he has to get well.

83
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,447
A person like that himself he tie up
all his luggage and go away.

84
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:29,189
But the main people, the people
who are grown up

85
00:18:29,214 --> 00:18:35,988
and who are matured, should keep
their maturity and assert it.

86
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:48,929
It’s in the form of light, again.

87
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:56,322
Now, if there are many lights
like these are,

88
00:18:56,347 --> 00:19:00,939
and one of them goes out, doesn’t
matter, because it’s,

89
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:04,324
there are so many others
like that.

90
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:16,549
But if there is one light which is
matured enough,

91
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:20,786
even all of them go away,
doesn’t matter.

92
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:37,428
So the people who are half sahaja
yogis, or quarter sahaja yogis

93
00:19:42,627 --> 00:19:48,717
have to understand that they play
no important role in Sahaja Yoga.

94
00:19:57,908 --> 00:20:03,560
Everybody has to become a full-fledged
sahaja yogi.

95
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:12,165
Then it matters a lot

96
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:19,062
if a such sahaja yogi is sick,
or is in problem,

97
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:25,043
all the angels would run to help
them.

98
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:38,002
So today is a special day
to celebrate

99
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:44,213
the kingdom of God on earth.

100
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:55,479
As we used to pray: “Thy Kingdom
come, on this earth.”

101
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:03,595
And it has come today on this
mountain.

102
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:12,598
And we are here to celebrate
the coming

103
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:23,932
of the kingdom of God, as we have
been praying for ages!

104
00:21:33,263 --> 00:21:42,910
And the blessings of kingdom of God is
that you get drenched in joy.

105
00:21:47,913 --> 00:21:52,813
Joy which has no duality, like
happiness and unhappiness.

106
00:21:55,999 --> 00:22:01,525
Is an experience of absoluteness.

107
00:22:02,556 --> 00:22:07,354
And just that joy is sufficient,
you don’t want any food,

108
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:11,632
you don’t want to sleep, you don’t mind
where you are,

109
00:22:11,657 --> 00:22:15,483
just in joy drenched completely.

110
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:30,750
There’s no place for unhappiness,

111
00:22:31,548 --> 00:22:34,501
we have no heart for it.

112
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:40,676
Italians were known to be
melancholic people,

113
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:50,012
but now I find all of them are so joyous
that nobody can believe

114
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:54,194
that they could have been melancholic
once upon a time.

115
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:04,748
Not only that, but they are giving
so much joy.

116
00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:11,968
The program should open our eyes
of all the Europeans to see

117
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:15,689
how on the stage they were singing
songs to Me,

118
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:21,409
and everybody in the audience
was clapping and enjoying it.

119
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:37,688
Because Italians are very humble
people.

120
00:23:39,696 --> 00:23:43,489
And it is the humble who will be
entering into the kingdom of God,

121
00:23:43,514 --> 00:23:46,213
and not the arrogant.

122
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:55,603
They’ll have to go to hell to get rid
of their arrogance.

123
00:23:59,282 --> 00:24:04,069
This is something is very great that
we are celebrating Diwali here,

124
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:08,003
that in the place where people
are humble,

125
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:17,355
and they have the right to be
joyous.

126
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:23,365
They have the right on their
Mother,

127
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:30,871
they have the right to ask for anything
that they want.

128
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:37,056
This is what is surrendering.

129
00:24:38,962 --> 00:24:43,601
Humble person means the person
who doesn’t have ego.

130
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:51,425
So to burn off ego, and to burn off
our conditioning,

131
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,342
we had this festival called Holi.

132
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:08,415
But now we have a new festival,
which is a festival

133
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,080
of singing songs of joy,

134
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,145
and joy alone.

135
00:25:22,496 --> 00:25:26,665
In this Diwali day, let us wish

136
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:32,693
that so many people fall into
this ocean of joy,

137
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:51,971
and the ocean of joy has to expand
its borders, shores.

138
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:59,682
A sea never does that,

139
00:26:01,554 --> 00:26:08,505
but sahaja yogis can do it because
they have ocean of love in their hearts.

140
00:26:13,484 --> 00:26:19,092
So I wish you all a very happy Diwali,
in the sense

141
00:26:19,117 --> 00:26:23,807
that you will enlighten more lights,
every sahaja yogi

142
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:30,138
should enlighten at least hundred
lights in this year.

143
00:26:43,164 --> 00:26:49,727
Every person you meet, you can talk
to them about Sahaja Yoga.

144
00:26:52,587 --> 00:26:58,142
Not about Me. Later on,
gradually.

145
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:08,233
So I hope you’ll enjoy your Diwali here,
all of you,

146
00:27:08,258 --> 00:27:14,372
and we’ll create an ocean which
will expand, grow,

147
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:20,541
and engulf more and more people
into this joyous company.

148
00:27:29,451 --> 00:27:33,171
Today, I don’t want to say that
I’m sorry because I came late,

149
00:27:33,204 --> 00:27:37,503
which won’t be good on a joyous
day like this.

150
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:46,500
But waiting has so dividends
to play, pay

151
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:54,517
– waiting gives you another kind
of appreciation of meeting.

152
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:08,811
May God bless you all.

153
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:17,682
So we should continue with music…
