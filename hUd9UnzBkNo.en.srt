1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,100
You must pray, to God and ask, what you want.

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:17,540
Ask for: Complete satisfaction in my heart,
joy in my heart, bliss in my heart, so that

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,060
the whole world becomes blissful.

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:28,360
Give me love, love that I could… love the
whole world and that the whole world becomes

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,580
one in love.

6
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:50,060
Give salvation to this… humanity.

7
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,980
Which is suffering.

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,600
Take me to Your feet.

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,000
Cleanse me with Thy love.

10
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,620
Now see if there is God or not?

11
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,840
You can feel it within yourself.

12
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,860
He hears you.

13
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,820
He understands you.

14
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:44,200
He’s the glory of all the glory.

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,900
He loves you.

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,160
He protects you.

17
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,280
He guides you.

18
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,580
He created you to reveal His love, but accept it.

19
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:19,360
Any time any thought is coming you pray and
you will be moving in the waves of that ocean

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:27,100
which is unconscious mind, which starts with
thoughtless awareness.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:12,600
If you cannot become thoughtless,
you pray to Him: “Forgive me for what I

22
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:20,260
have done and forgive those who have done
harm to me.
