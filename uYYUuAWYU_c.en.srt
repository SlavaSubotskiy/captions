1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:18,500
I 

2
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,560
bow to all the seekers of truth. The other
day I talked to you about the experience of

3
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:47,269
truth. That the truth has to be felt through
your central nervous system. If anything has

4
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:57,410
to happen to your evolution you have to feel
it through your central nervous system otherwise

5
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:06,059
it is just a projection of your mind which
forms it and you are surprised at yourself.

6
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:18,789
Like we call somebody as a friend and one
day we find there is no friendship. Maybe

7
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,270
one day the friend will try to murder you
or you may try to murder that person. You

8
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:40,270
just don't understand what happened to that
love. Same thing about all our projections,

9
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:48,240
we find it has no basis, it's so superficial.
When we realise that all is so superficial,

10
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:02,630
it has no basis, we just get frustrated and
we start thinking, what is all this, we are

11
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:12,770
playing games. One can't be sincere. What
has happened to us? Why are we so frivolous?

12
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:21,180
Why are we so superficial? We may start taking
interest in things which look superficially

13
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:32,250
very great, but ultimately we find that it
doesn't have any depth in it and suddenly

14
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,510
to our horror we discover that everything
seems to be relative in this world, nothing

15
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:50,510
is absolute. So the experience of the truth
has to be absolute. Means everybody should

16
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,040
feel that way, if not then it is something
poetical because each poet sees the reality

17
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,409
in a different way, describes in a different
way. But if he is a truthful poet he keeps

18
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:18,409
the essence at least the same. But when we
say we have to feel the truth, by everyone

19
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,400
in an absolute manner, what does that mean?
That means when we get our self realisation,

20
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:45,280
when we think we have got a new awareness
of collective consciousness, that means we

21
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,180
are unconnected with the whole, with the absolute,
then everyone of us who is like that should

22
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:10,239
feel the same way. For example there's a person
who is sick and you get ten children who are

23
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:20,939
realised souls, that means we say are realised
souls, now tie their eyes so that they cannot

24
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:33,659
see at all and ask them what centres are catching
in this person. All of them will raise the

25
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:42,930
same finger. This is the finger that is catching.
And if you ask that person relative to that

26
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,900
finger, have you got this trouble, he'll say
yes, but how do you know? How do these children

27
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:57,900
know? So the truth is felt by everyone the
same. Then it is absolute. If somebody sees

28
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:12,050
a blue colour, if somebody sees a red colour
then it is not the truth. And you'll be amazed

29
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,400
when you become self realised, if you meet
people who are self realised, you'll be amazed

30
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:31,620
they will say the same thing in a different
way in a different , but they say the same.

31
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:39,840
It is very amazing that people who were in
India, who were in Lebanon, who were in China,

32
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,840
who were in England had nothing to do with
each other, had no communication what so ever

33
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,840
and they say the same thing. So down within
us there is something that is absolute that

34
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,600
tells us about absolute. So the second experience
should be of absoluteness. The Divine power

35
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,960
that is all pervading, if it is truthful,
if it is real, then all of us who are feeling

36
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:35,050
that power through this realisation should
receive the same message as

37
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:45,930
this is the second proof of and you put this
test to anyone who says that this is self

38
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:57,410
realisation. This is a very, very important
thing for you to understand that truth has

39
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:10,130
to be one, it has to be absolute and if you
can establish your report with the absolute

40
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:20,130
you cannot have any other information but
the truth. So as you ascend in Sahaja Yoga

41
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,080
you start learning that what ever messages
you are getting is the truth, that all these

42
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:45,500
messages that you are receiving you can your
self perceive them, can feel them, nobody

43
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:52,500
has to tell you. Even a child can sense it.
So you move one step forward into a world

44
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:02,810
call faith, which is the faith of experience.
You call say this now, how do you know it

45
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,080
is not artificial? It is real because you
have experience of the artificial; and the

46
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:24,080
real and now when you feel it you can say
with faith "yes it is real". In the same way

47
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:35,110
reality can only be accepted if you go through
the experience of truth and then have faith.

48
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:55,930
Human mind is a very wonderful mind. English
word mind doesn't explain much though what

49
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:06,500
mind is but in Sahaja Yoga it has been very
clearly explained what human mind creates.

50
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:18,220
Here you see very clearly that on top of the
head there, you see a lotus. You can say how

51
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:33,010
can there be a lotus on top of the head Mother,
this sounds very poetic and something fantastic

52
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:40,010
and even fantasy of course I wish everybody
had that lotus blooming. But very few have

53
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:55,560
it but still they have no doubt. Now this
one, when you see the lotus, before that if

54
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:03,390
you see the brain in Sahaja Yoga is just shown
as a hollow thing. There's nothing like brain

55
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:13,070
tissue and all that. But there are two, one
is blue the other is yellow [somebody show

56
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:28,300
John, somebody], two balloon like structures
in the brain. Now when the first balloon only

57
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:48,690
existed, when we were just animals our brain
was flat, so was the Himalayas. Himalayas

58
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:59,160
represents our brain in the gross life. So
the Himalaya was also flat and our brain was

59
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:09,420
also flat. Then man started hitting with branches
when the animals attacked them, they (learned)

60
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:27,019
how to hit back and another line started which
we call as the sun line but we see another

61
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:37,899
side started developing and the brain got
transformed into a new formation of a triangular

62
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:51,060
thing. This triangular brain, now is like
a pyramid I've seen and sometimes I find it

63
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:58,940
swollen very much more on one side ....
So all our problems started from that point

64
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:11,370
where we decided that we can do it. We..............................
and then we started doing it that way. This

65
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:26,079
yellow stuff which we call as ego started
pushing the superego in such a manner that

66
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:33,079
the brain became a prism like structure. But
is was important this prism. The Himalayas

67
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:43,510
also developed a triangular structure. It
was very important that it should have happened

68
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:57,660
in the human brain,
that we had developed this ego within ourselves.

69
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:04,660
We could have avoided it if we had not committed
the mistake at the stage of Adam and Eve,

70
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:16,200
but we did commit,
and that short circuit got elongated and our

71
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:24,660
evolution started going on a different line
where we wanted to find out ourselves what

72
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:35,470
is the truth.
So a journey started and started moving so

73
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:52,579
fast that they remain in the state of a balloon
, nothing else but a balloon exists. So we

74
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:06,050
became nothing but balloons floating superficially.
The balance was lost completely and the whole

75
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:16,839
problem has started with this balloon, that
we have put in the effort, we can find , we

76
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:33,230
can discover this. Like one scientist was
forced by a King 
that he should try to create gold out of perfume,

77
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:50,250
poor fellow he tried his level best he could
not, but as a result he found out how to make

78
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:58,709
beautiful china. That's exactly what has happened
to human beings, in the search of truth we

79
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:09,600
have discovered everything else but the truth.
Because truth you cannot discover, as I told

80
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:20,459
you the other day it is a state that one has
to achieve, one has to achieve to receive

81
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:39,769
the truth, to know the truth
So some people felt that truth is what we

82
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:21,550
have found, like blind people, what ever they
have found out they called it as truth. Even

83
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:36,120
in India, where people have a great sense
of meditation, people committed mistakes and

84
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:50,860
what they found is the movement on the right
hand side and they said yes, there is all

85
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:04,959
pervading power and that is formless. The
left hand people found while praying to God

86
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:24,110
that there are forms so they talked of the
forms. Some talked of the formless and some

87
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:38,200
talked of the form. The right sided people
being the worshippers of the Goddess of learning

88
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:50,830
wrote down everything as Vedas [most ancient
Hindu scriptures] but in the very beginning

89
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:57,679
of Vedas, Vedas means to know, and to know
means to evolve to become self realised. It

90
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,679
is not when I talk to you what you know, is
not, the knowledge is which is expressed,

91
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:15,520
manifested on your central nervous system.
The truth. So they wrote down what they found,

92
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:25,820
that we have to first excite or initiate the
nature. So they wrote all those things, now

93
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:38,160
that has become an authentic writing, big
for intellectuals, that to after many, many

94
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:45,500
years
people they knew it by heart. Authentically

95
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:52,500
you might say that Vedas came only about 800
or something like that, all that writing,

96
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:05,110
if you go by that you'll be lost into another
wild goose chase and those who read only Vedas

97
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:18,120
can never find that what is supposed to be
known. In the first chapter or the first verse

98
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:25,990
of the Vedas that by reading this book if
you do not get the knowledge no good reading

99
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:35,250
Vedas. But there are books & books & books,
libraries & libraries & libraries, all the

100
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:42,490
wild goose chase. Many of the systems follow,
was the system of fearing the God, then finding

101
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,960
out the forms of God, worshipping God as form.
The incarnations came on this earth and people

102
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:08,910
worshipped them, like Christ. Now there is
a challenge on Christ, these intellectuals

103
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,559
will challenge everything because they challenge
everything through the intellect. The trouble

104
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:19,240
is that they think they are the wisest. Such
wise people they have time for, is impossible.

105
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:26,240
You have to be a little humble. So the intellectual
as usual challenge and the others who just

106
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:39,390
believe without intellectuals were the people
who just believed into things without knowing.

107
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Who had just faith, as our emotional songs
are, are. All these extreme movements on both

108
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:05,700
the sides created two different types of people,
one who we can call as intellectuals and another

109
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:13,700
as
They did not create self realised people because

110
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,880
ego makes a person so superficial and so stupid
that he cannot grasp, it's beyond him. He

111
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:34,010
is so stupid. He cannot grasp the truth. Is
a barrier, is a projection outside, he is

112
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:41,830
a concave personality, is a convex personality.
Brain is convex. And the other one is so concave,

113
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:53,280
is so conditioned that you cannot compete.
That's how the quality of seekers came on

114
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:02,570
this earth, who are seeking truth.
Now we should also know that God must be worried

115
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:14,450
about his creation, he must be worried about
the people who are crated by him, who became

116
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:23,620
human beings, who are seekers, special category.
What hypocrites, you cannot tell people, you

117
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:34,210
cannot help them but those who are real seekers.
There are many real seekers and he must be

118
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:43,260
worried about all these seekers and he must
have arranged something for them and that

119
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:51,900
is how Christ came on this earth . He came
on this earth to guide and tell us that you

120
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:03,190
can find the truth by your second birth. You
are to be born again. You are to be born again,

121
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,460
then there are people who just believe that
I am born again, you see self opinionated,

122
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:18,880
I'm alright! I've found it! Stupid people,
they just believe, certify themselves they

123
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,880
have found it. They just give themselves a
certificate, oh I've found it, but who is

124
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:41,299
the loser? It's not God. He can reveal himself
to you if you want to know him, through your

125
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:53,620
evolution, through your effortlessness. But
as you have seen Patanjali for the real seekers

126
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:13,970
but people took out of Patanjali also what
they tell them is the physical exercise, I

127
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:22,090
mean just imagine, it is like a person who
has been invited to dinner to do dish-washing,

128
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,740
it's that stupid. And that book, even today
thank God, despite all the intellectuals attacks

129
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,919
and all nonsense, he just talked of the formless
not of the form so much but he does say that

130
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:56,510
you have to neutralise your effort too, you
have to neutralise your thought which are

131
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:06,480
and in the absence of that thought only the
Kundalini will rise.

132
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:20,460
Now a vicious circle is created, even when
we say we fight with that thought

133
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:46,130
a thought in the mind
so something has to happen 
and that is what happens

134
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:18,659
but is all done by God Almighty within us,
that he has made these beautiful chakras.

135
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:25,659
They are made from different elements, the
essence of different elements and all incarnations

136
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:39,340
of our ascent are placed there to guide those
subtle centres. Is already within us, we may

137
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:48,590
not know about it but they exist within us
and ultimately 
the residual, they call it, the residual power,

138
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:04,590
that is Kundalini; it is residual because
it has created everything but has not manifested

139
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:11,840
itself, is the pure desire to know the truth,
pure desire to know the Divine, to become

140
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:22,659
the Divine, is still sleeping.
When these chakras are in proper shape it

141
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:33,830
spontaneously rises just like a seed sprouts,
you don't have to do anything to reduce your

142
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:47,149
efforts and your thoughts. Your thoughts are
created and they disappear again they come

143
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:55,539
up and disappear, there's a little gap in
between and that gap widens by the ascent

144
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:03,399
of Kundalini and you become thoughtless without
any effort. With effort you cannot, that's

145
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:12,309
the point. This mechanism exists within us.
Now if something happens here say for example

146
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:20,929
this is working out, then we go into the mechanism
of this and try to find out how this is working

147
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:28,370
out. Now if you want to see, you can see the
rising of the Kundalini, you can see the breaking

148
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:41,580
of the Kundalini, you can feel the cool breeze
coming out of you. Now how it happens

149
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,520
it is the cool breeze that emits on top of
your head, is the first sign that your Kundalini

150
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:18,720
awakened and then when you start feeling it
all around now you are in connection with

151
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:27,779
the all pervading power. Before that we are
denying the truth. It's all done by God, by

152
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:38,210
his grace, he's made it all so beautiful,
so very, very beautiful, we don't do a thing,

153
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:43,529
we don't have to do a thing, but that is the
point, we cannot do, that we don't have to

154
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:50,529
do anything about it. Always they ask me,
then what must we do, I said you don't do

155
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:57,549
anything, that's the point. Is it too much
to accept? But how do we become human beings

156
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:07,890
from monkeys do we
for anything . How does a seed sprout? By

157
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:19,659
itself spontaneously.
In the same way your evolution has to take

158
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:26,659
place spontaneously. And every time somebody
has to lead, somebody has to go forward, somebody

159
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:40,630
has to be bold, somebody has to conquer. Maybe
somebody else would have been better for this

160
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:52,070
job, as I said, I would be very happy to retire
but that's what it is, it's true. I have to

161
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:59,070
do this job, it is a thankless job no doubt
but I have to do it, so what can I do about

162
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:08,820
it?
That should not upset you. That upsets people

163
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:17,130
but I don't do anything actually, it is a
myth like the sun shines, it doesn't do anything

164
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:28,600
does it? But when the sun shines the leaves
become green, just happens, I mean the sun

165
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,830
doesn't take any credit or doesn't say that
the trees must offer God their goodness or

166
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:41,830
something to him. They are not angry with
the sun are you? Because it tans our body.

167
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Do you? In the same way it's somebody's nature
to do that, and somebody's nature is to ascend

168
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:03,529
and to rise
people who achieve it, don't you think so?

169
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:09,840
So there is nothing to feel unhappy about.
This is another problem which I told you last

170
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,840
time, that in the west it is a really big
hurdle for people. You cannot pay for it,

171
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:26,679
you cannot put in any effort, you cannot do
anything about it, it has to work out otherwise

172
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:32,909
we cannot guarantee that. If it is there it
will work out, if it is not there it will

173
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:39,330
not work out. If the desire is pure it will
work out and then you have to work it out

174
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:46,330
to keep it there.
So by reading about it you may never understand,

175
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,000
there are so many people who did
so many people who did Gita , so many people

176
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:05,279
in India who know by heart the whole of Gita,
the meaning, everything but they have sickness,

177
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:17,149
they've ill feelings, they're unhappy or ego
oriented, something wrong, somewhere. Nothing

178
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:30,590
wrong with the scriptures, we have forgotten
it is said you are to be born again.

179
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:39,850
So the third experience should be of transformation.
If it cannot bring out the virtue in you,

180
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,840
if it cannot give you the strength of your
spirit, if it cannot transform you then it

181
00:33:54,649 --> 00:34:01,649
is not self realisation. But transformation
can be taken like this that people can just

182
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,609
change the colour of their clothes and say
we are transformed, now we have taken a sanyasa,

183
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:17,609
also can be like that, all such self opinionated
people. It's not that, it's no opinion, is

184
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:35,419
to be in that state is important, to be in
that state that's the truth and that's the

185
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:42,419
truth you should ask for, nothing else. Are
you transformed by it and the first transformation

186
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:53,540
you feel, before you change your temperament,
before you change your habit, before you take

187
00:34:53,540 --> 00:35:00,540
anything is that your central nervous system
acquires a new dimension of collective consciousness.

188
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:08,190
Acquires! You get it. And you can verify it.
But human beings still think they have a right

189
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:20,660
to no Mother no much, I don't believe in it.
It's alright, who are you, I mean don't believe

190
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:28,500
in yourself. So the first thing that should
happen in this experience of transformation

191
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:38,980
or evolution is that you become, again I say
become, become, become collectively conscious,

192
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:50,300
by which you know your chakras and you know
the chakras of others, you know the subtle

193
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:57,140
problems you have, the subtle diseases you
have, the hidden problems you have. The whole

194
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:03,510
life which was abnormal comes to normal you
see because you can see abnormal. Supposing

195
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:09,450
I am standing on the edge of this and there
is no light, I cannot see, I may fall down.

196
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:16,450
I am about to fall down I cannot see but then
is light, I see. So why not get into balance.

197
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:25,220
That is enlightenment. If enlightenment doesn't
give you the vision of wisdom it is not enlightenment

198
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:31,030
at all. You drink, you smoke, you see all
kinds of things, you have temper everything

199
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:37,250
exists and you say oh God I am a very religious
person and the second thing that comes to

200
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:44,250
you is some sort of . So your virtue, your
virtue must shine and that's the time is today

201
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:59,050
according to the Shalivan calendar this is
the true faith. This is the yuga when there

202
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:10,060
is, is the age when there is perfection means
where you get in contact, actual, with actuality.

203
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:22,780
That means you actualise it and that is the
time, today, that has come called as Krita

204
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:35,760
yuga.
That means all pervading power is actualised

205
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:43,160
and we feel the manifestation of that power
very, very clearly, on your central nervous

206
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:49,930
system. Because what ever is evolved within
you, you feel on your central nervous system.

207
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:56,930
So this new breakthrough is to be seen through
and not to be just accepted, not to have blind

208
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:07,619
faith, nothing of that kind. Then once you
come to a certain state then the subject gets

209
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:22,070
deeper and deeper and much more intense, but
first that state has to be established. Many

210
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:31,990
people have complained to me that Mother Sahaja
Yogis who are are rather secretive, there

211
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:39,780
are no secrets, no secrets but as a boy enters
say maybe the first class or the first he

212
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:51,599
cannot understand what areas to be discussed.
So he might feel this fellow is trying to

213
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:58,599
hide something in his books. One has to grow
to bear that truth also to bear that truth

214
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:09,730
he has to develop that power within ourselves
and that state we have to achieve.

215
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:19,990
I requested last time all the people of England
especially, because in the map of the Divine,

216
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:34,119
England represents the heart and the responsibility
of heart is the maximum and if they don't

217
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:44,820
pay attention to their heart the world will
have a heart attack. So how important it is

218
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:56,500
that we should seek our ascent as seekers.
Of course I don't say, you don't do this,

219
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,680
you don't do that, nothing of the kind, that
is not to be said anymore. Just first get

220
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:10,670
your realisation then you look after your
self I don't have to tell you. Then you get

221
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:15,040
your light you yourself will see that you
will not put your hand into the crocodiles

222
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,160
mouth there, are you? But first you must see
the crocodile, because if I tell you the crocodile

223
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:26,160
in the darkness, you say let me try even if
you, that's how it works.

224
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:34,970
It's so beautiful. There's a very beautiful
thing to achieve that's what we say is the

225
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:46,329
Kingdom of God, that's what we say that 

226
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:36,250
is 

227
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:53,170
that resides within us, that joy, that fills
the whole world as bliss, with complete auspiciousness

228
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:39,060
of God's being can be ours if 

229
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:07,339
we decide to be there, if we want we can go
through, no one, it is 

230
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:58,560
you 

231
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:08,060
who 

232
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:45,329
has 

233
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:05,270
to choose it 

234
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:17,930
in your own freedom only you can achieve your
complete freedom.

235
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:59,740
May 

236
01:05:57,609 --> 01:06:04,609
God Bless You.
