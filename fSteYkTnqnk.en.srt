1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:25,900
The organizers and the members of the Medical 
Association in Sholapur, its such a pleasure

2
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:37,680
to talk to (* inaudible text) because you 
have also heard that I did some medicine.

3
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,880
Just to talk to doctors about it.

4
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,980
Because in the realm of the divine, there 
are no names given to any plexuses.

5
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:55,270
It’s difficult to talk to doctors unless 
and until you know their language.

6
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:08,369
Now the main thing we have to understand about 
Sahaja yogi is this that when we are trying

7
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:18,080
to analyze or find out through scientific 
methods anything, we can only do it when that

8
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,390
part is available to us, apparent to us, that 
we can see it, we can feel it, we can analyze

9
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,390
it.

10
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,520
Like a tree, we see the tree on top of the 
Mother Earth.

11
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,200
For us it is easy to see the tree.

12
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,119
But supposing we have to go deep down into 
the roots.

13
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,200
So Sahaja Yoga is the knowledge of the roots 
and not of the tree.

14
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,259
Of Course, the tree is very important because 
root has no meaning if there is no tree.

15
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:59,880
But tree is more important when it can tell 
you that there are roots to it.

16
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,780
So all our knowledge of science whatever it 
is, whatever discoveries we have made, how

17
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,780
far we have gone?

18
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,470
I mean we can go very deep into it, I know 
that.

19
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,740
But still, you can not reach the absolute.

20
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,870
Because “absolute” is that point where 
you have to dissolve.

21
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:27,330
We have one scholar here, who is doing his 
P.H.D from Brighton and he has a subject how

22
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,840
to establish an absolute zero point in temperature.

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,590
You can not.

24
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,840
Nobody can.

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,720
Its a fact.

26
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,510
You can go up to a point but you can not become 
the absolute.

27
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:47,040
Through your mental projection because the 
mind is a limited thing.

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,569
We must understand the mind is limited.

29
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:53,330
Like I came by car, I had to leave my car 
behind to come inside.

30
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,890
In the same way this limited mind can not 
take you to something that is unlimited.

31
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,209
Because absolute has to be unlimited.

32
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:06,140
So to reach the absolute point what should 
be done.

33
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,640
That’s the main problem with all of us.

34
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:16,239
All those who are seekers, whether they are 
scientists or psychologists or anyway.

35
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,629
They have one point if they see correctly 
that we have not reached the absolute.

36
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:27,440
That is why we do not understand “why are 
we made human beings from amoeba state?”

37
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,670
We should ask ourselves a simple question,”why 
are we human beings?

38
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:37,760
What was the purpose of this evolution that 
we were made human beings?

39
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,599
So, as we can’t answer this question it 
is not answerable.

40
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:51,769
We have to know that we are in a transition 
state and this human awareness has to achieve

41
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:59,019
another awareness which is dynamic, which 
is collective in nature and many people I

42
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,200
would say like you, who has talked of collectivity.

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:13,810
Who has talked of collective awareness that 
a man, if he evolves, will become a collectively

44
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,810
conscious.

45
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,750
He could see that but he did not know how.

46
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,660
Even if you have to say that if you have to 
go to Sholapur you better take this road or

47
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,460
that road but if you can not reach Sholapur 
then you are not there in Sholapur.

48
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,430
So even if you say this is the way it has 
to be, unless and until somebody does it in

49
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,139
a practical way, in actualization you have 
to achieve it.

50
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,319
This is the problem.

51
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,970
Actual this is the problem, that exist between 
all the people who are seeking, between all

52
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,220
the enterprises, between all the moment we 
have.

53
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,130
There is no quarrel between God and Science.

54
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,670
One thing one should remember that Science 
has come from God to you.

55
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,590
It has not come from you.

56
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,870
For example, if you say there is gravity.

57
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,930
Now, you have not put gravity in the Mother 
Earth, did you?

58
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,020
We can not even transform one flower into 
a fruit.

59
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,830
Not one flower into fruit.

60
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,190
Can you imagine?

61
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,259
So there is some living power which is doing 
this living job.

62
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:27,849
Now think an Indian has a child he is an Indian, 
this sorting out is done.

63
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:33,560
You know that any foreign matter that goes 
into the body is thrown away.

64
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,669
Has to be thrown away.

65
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:40,300
But when the fetus is conceived, then it is 
kept, nourished, properly looked after and

66
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,580
is thrown out at the right time.

67
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,240
Who does that job?

68
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,490
We must think.

69
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:56,310
There are so many things for example acidic 
(* unclear text- some medical name) of course

70
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,240
doctors, I must say or scientists are honest.

71
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,650
So they say, their mode of action in human 
body they can not explain.

72
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,340
They just openly say if they can not.

73
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,020
Because it may augment or it may not.

74
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,699
But Sahaja yoga can explain, why it happens.

75
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:19,330
Why it has to happen like that.

76
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:27,139
Now the jumping from this knowledge from the 
mind into the knowledge of the eternal is

77
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:28,360
a difficult task.

78
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
To accept it.

79
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,659
Because as doctor (*unclear text) has told 
you that when we get education we think we

80
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:38,090
know quite a lot.

81
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,919
Not that you do not know.

82
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,551
Not that, this knowledge is not needed.

83
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:42,551
Its very important.

84
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:45,009
If you are a doctor, you will be a great sahaja 
yogi.

85
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,009
No doubt.

86
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:52,349
But something is not known to you which is 
much greater than what is known to you.

87
00:06:52,349 --> 00:07:00,849
So this human awareness, this “chetna” 
that is within you today has to rise to that

88
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:07,379
level or you have to become that subtle that 
you can enter into your roots.

89
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:08,379
Alright?

90
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:14,780
So on this point we start moving further that 
you are paying attention to me but if I say

91
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,900
pay attention to yourself.

92
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,610
You can not.

93
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,449
How will you do it.

94
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:22,449
You can not do it.

95
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,960
You can not see your self, you can not see 
your organs, you can not see your body, you

96
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,439
can not see anything, you can not see your 
mind.

97
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,050
You can not feel it.

98
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,090
So what should happen?

99
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,599
Say something falls down, immediately our 
attention goes there.

100
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:47,139
Some happening has to take place within ourselves 
and that happening is nothing but kundalini

101
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,909
awakening.

102
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:56,530
Now this kundalini is a force which is lying 
in the triangular bone which is called as

103
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,530
sacrum.

104
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:04,530
(Shri Mataji asks for some water in hindi/marathi) 
I have been speaking and speaking and hours

105
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:13,460
and hours together.

106
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,210
Now this triangular bone is called as sacrum.

107
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,110
Sacrum means sacred.

108
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,050
In greek language, sacrum means sacred.

109
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,509
When I went to Greece, I asked them why do 
you call it sacrum?

110
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:34,640
So they told me that they had a rapport with 
Indians much much before, Alexander came here

111
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,780
and the Indians told them that there is a 
power in this triangular bone.

112
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,130
Can you imagine?

113
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:49,730
We have forgotten it, we have lost it because 
we have studied only the british or whatever

114
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,820
is english or you can call it a western medical 
science.

115
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,630
But in our science, you will be surprised, 
fourteen thousand years back Markandeya has

116
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,520
talked about it.

117
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:09,010
We Indians are best suited to understand this.

118
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:14,790
Now many people say that Mahasrashtra has 
got three and a half “pithas”.

119
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:20,480
Many people must have heard there are three 
and a half “pithas” one of them is “Mahalaxmi”,

120
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:29,650
then another is “Tulzapur Bhavani” then 
third one is “Mahur” and half one is “Chaturshringi”.

121
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,560
Now (*unclear text) something so funny and 
stupid.

122
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,910
I mean, I can undertand as doctors.

123
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,770
But its not.

124
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,010
Believe me.

125
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,160
These are the three and a half coils of the 
kundalini of the whole universe placed in

126
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,720
your Maharashtra.

127
00:09:45,720 --> 00:10:00,150
They are the source of that power within your 
own country this great Maharashtra.

128
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:04,130
Now people may not believe it.

129
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,790
But how will you know?

130
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:15,370
Now, somebody says “this is a “jagrut 
sthana” (means awakened place) I mean doctors

131
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,370
do namaskar to Ganesha and they go to temple 
and all.

132
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:25,530
But they do not know that Ganesha is placed 
within us and he controls our prostate and

133
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,810
he controls all our pelvic plexuses.

134
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,910
We do not know this.

135
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,660
But he resides there.

136
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:46,200
So to jump from that to this is rather difficult 
for a medical man, I understand that.

137
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,630
(unclear/inaudible text) who were studying 
with me I never talk to them about Kundalini

138
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,630
or anything.

139
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,380
I just wanted to be like them to understand 
how their brains have worked.

140
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,530
For them, this is knowledge, this is everything, 
nothing beyond.

141
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:05,070
And anybody who talks about it they turn faces 
like that.

142
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:11,320
Now I do not want you to come to any conclusion 
by saying of course Gyaneshwara has talked

143
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,350
about it so he can not be wrong and this and 
that.

144
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,570
Not at all.

145
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:28,580
But scientifically, we have to understand 
that we have not got answers to many questions.

146
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,560
That means there is no sufficient light, in 
our knowledge.

147
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,500
If you are coming in this room in darkness 
you might find a mic, you might find a table,

148
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,010
you might find something.

149
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,800
This becomes the truth.

150
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,170
Because the eyes are not yet opened or the 
light is not there.

151
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:50,250
But supposing by any chance, somebody can 
open the light, you can see all the things.

152
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,250
Isn’t it?

153
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,720
That what doctor Berjodi ji is talking about 
the integration part.

154
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,650
Now this light is nothing but your auto.

155
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,380
Which you talk of as “Autonomous Nervous 
System”.

156
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,800
You just give the name, Auto.

157
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,410
Now, who is auto?

158
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,620
We accept it.

159
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,400
When we get the names, we just accept the 
name, we never ask why it is called auto.

160
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:20,240
Because it is “swayamchalit” (which runs 
by itself) who is the swayam?

161
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,790
Who is the “sw” is the spirit.

162
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:28,380
In a way, we have accepted because we have 
to fix somebody as auto otherwise we don’t

163
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,380
know what to do.

164
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,830
I mean, we see parasympathetic working, sympathetic 
working so we have to fix up somebody as a

165
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,590
person behind the two.

166
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,910
But that auto is the spirit, is the “atma”, 
we do not want to accept.

167
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,910
Alright.

168
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,910
We will call it auto if you don’t like it.

169
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,730
For the scientist, if they don’t like it 
we will call it auto only.

170
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:52,160
So this Mr. auto, is the atma according to 
Sahaja Yoga.

171
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,650
We call it atma, you call it auto.

172
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,680
That’s the only difference of names.

173
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,560
Now this auto exists within us.

174
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,020
But this auto is not in our central nervous 
system.

175
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,020
That is true.

176
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,220
Because we can not control our parasympathetic.

177
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:18,010
We may be able to excite our sympathetic but 
not the parasympathetic, that’s the fact.

178
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,290
Sympathetic, if we excite, it, we can work 
out.

179
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,790
But parasympathetic we can not work out.

180
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,170
It works automatically.

181
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:31,820
So somehow or other, if you can bring that 
auto in your attention or in your central

182
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,090
nervous system then you can manage the show 
better.

183
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,870
Scientifically.

184
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,090
I am just going scientifically.

185
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,090
Alright.

186
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,810
Now, how to bring this auto in your attention?

187
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,040
How to control this auto?

188
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,630
Is the problem.

189
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,270
You can not do through science.

190
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,150
You can not do through medical science.

191
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,340
Through any science you can not do.

192
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,560
Because this will only happen when you will 
evolve to another stage.

193
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,730
And science can not bring in evolution.

194
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,730
Can it?

195
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:07,160
It can not give you wisdom and it can not 
give you evolution.

196
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,300
Evolution it can not give.

197
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,330
Why?

198
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:22,660
It can not even create life, I would say.

199
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:30,220
So this auto, to be in your central nervous 
system we should look inside ourselves.

200
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:39,320
There could be some arrangement and for that 
the knowledge is in your great country.

201
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,240
Already there.

202
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,090
You are the one who have inherited that (unclear 
text).

203
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,810
This is what you have inherited.

204
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,150
It is your inheritance which is lost.

205
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:59,190
But one must know that when the tree grows 
too high it must have roots.

206
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,670
And that is how, whatever they are saying 
about me..I am the tap root, I must say.

207
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,870
Who has done the seeking inside perhaps or 
I have reached at source and that’s how

208
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,850
I know what is the root.

209
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:19,200
In our country, many saints have tried to 
go through that path and have found out.

210
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,820
They have tried to express it in many ways 
but they kept it a secret till the sixth century

211
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,570
when Adi Shankaracharya came and he talked 
about it very clearly.

212
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:33,220
He talked about kundalini, he talked about 
all the chakras, he talked about everything.

213
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,830
But who reads Adi Shankaracharya.

214
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,600
Atleast the medical man does not.

215
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:47,880
I mean, I don’t blame them because they 
are so busy.

216
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,940
And after that it was all exposed.

217
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,890
Then Kabira clearly, clearly, clearly absolutely 
clearly talked about it.

218
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,330
So Sahaja yoga is not a new system.

219
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,390
It is “Anadi”, it is old.

220
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,830
Only thing, what has happened to Sahaja Yoga 
today that it has become a “Mahayoga”.

221
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,140
That there are many many thousands can get 
realization.

222
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,600
That was not possible and feasible.

223
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,890
This is the only thing that has happened that 
today the blossom time has come and many flowers

224
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,760
can become fruits.

225
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,080
And that’s how even an ordinary person gets 
self realization.

226
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,750
A poor man can get realization, a doctor can 
get realization.

227
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,480
Anybody can get realization.

228
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,450
And sooner you get the better it is.

229
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,290
So now the first thing what will happen to 
you.

230
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,850
Supposing you get the light within yourself 
and you can see within yourself.

231
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,440
Say you have an X-ray to see yourself within 
yourself.

232
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,440
So first thing that should happen to you is 
that you should know about yourself, what’s

233
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,970
the problem with you.

234
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:54,340
You’ll be amazed people end up in lunatic 
asylums and till they are absolutely gone

235
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,870
cases people do not know that they are mad.

236
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,870
Same about cancer.

237
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:04,030
I would say, cancer can be detected much earlier 
than doctors can detect it.

238
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,589
Very simple it is.

239
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:10,750
Any disease connected with liver is another 
thing.

240
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:16,429
I would say even liver problems are not detected 
till a patient gets a cirrhosis or some sort

241
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:24,529
of a disease which is absolutely fatal and 
you declare alright, now you go into coma.

242
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:25,529
Finished!

243
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:30,470
These can be detected through Sahaja Yoga 
very well because once you are enlightened,

244
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,600
your fingers.

245
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,669
These five fingers, six and seven (ShriMataji 
describes the chakras on her palm) They start

246
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:36,669
denoting the centers.

247
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,049
And on these fingers you can know.

248
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:44,919
Now according to Sahaja Yoga left side deals, 
left side sympathetic deals with your emotional

249
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,750
side and right side deals with physical and 
mental side.

250
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,750
Clearcut.

251
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,919
So now you see a person who is very busy.

252
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,259
Who is a doctor, say for example.

253
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:05,090
He is a very busy man and he has no time at 
all.

254
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,039
He is always looking at his watch, naturally.

255
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,080
So what happens to him?

256
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,590
He becomes a right sided person.

257
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,510
Because he is using his physical being and 
also he is mental being.

258
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,889
But the emotional becomes little dried out.

259
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:22,789
So emotionally he is not so good.

260
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:24,360
Emotionally, he goes off.

261
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,190
As a result, you won’t believe.

262
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,020
As a result of this imbalance what disease 
one can get to being with.

263
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,679
According to Sahaja Yoga, this is another 
principle.

264
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,409
According to Sahaja Yoga because I will not 
say that medical people will agree to it or

265
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,419
they have found out.

266
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:44,289
They might find out later on but just now 
they have not found, so far.

267
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,340
Because I did medicine, because you are all 
younger to me in age.

268
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,799
So when i did my medicine you might have been 
just young boys.

269
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,720
So may be my terminology may be little different.

270
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,750
But does not matter.

271
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,570
So according to Sahaja Yoga the brain is made 
of fat cells.

272
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,120
That is according to medical science also.

273
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,659
Now these fat cells, when they are used too 
much they are replaced, they are replaced

274
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:14,600
by the fat of the stomach.

275
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,990
And the conversion for the use of the brain 
of the special cells is created by a center

276
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,789
we call at “Swadhisthana Chakra” which 
actually on the physical level you can say

277
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,570
is aortic plexus.

278
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,570
On the physical.

279
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,710
In the “Sukshama” (subtle) is swadhisthana 
Chakra.

280
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:39,140
So one of the jobs of the swadhisthana chakra 
is to convert these cells for the use of the

281
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,140
brain.

282
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:47,899
And the other job is to look after your liver, 
look after your pancreas, look after your

283
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:52,409
spleen and your kidneys and in ladies, uterus.

284
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:54,149
Part of it.

285
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:59,610
So when you think too much or plan too much 
and you are futuristic.

286
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:05,490
Most of the time this poor one, swadhistahana 
chakra is busy coping with that thinking process

287
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,539
and replacing the brain cells.

288
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,539
Alright.

289
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:13,500
So it neglects all these organs which are 
very vital and important to us.

290
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:22,830
So the first trouble one many get by thinking 
too much is diabetes.

291
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:27,330
Now, if you ask a doctor, he will say don’t 
eat sugar.

292
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,649
But this is no cure of the disease.

293
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:35,080
But you see villagers eat at least five spoons 
in one cup of tea.

294
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,100
At least five spoons.

295
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,120
They never get diabetes.

296
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,279
It’s only the people who think and plan 
too much for the future get it.

297
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,659
First is diabetes.

298
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:53,710
The another is very dangerous is leukemia.

299
00:20:53,710 --> 00:21:00,330
Leukemia also one gets from the same type 
of life style.

300
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,999
Believe me.

301
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:08,760
Because you know at emergencies, this spleen 
has to produce new RBCs(red blood corpuscles)

302
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,809
that is accepted.

303
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:11,809
Alright.

304
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:19,700
Now, a person who is getting up in the morning, 
see rushing up, just, its very interesting

305
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,700
how it is.

306
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,350
Just think of it.

307
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,230
Everybody does that but we never see ourselves 
how we behave.

308
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,920
And he goes to the bathroom and comes out 
with his pants just being tied up and the

309
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,509
wife is there to give him breakfast and one 
side he is eating the breakfast.

310
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:39,029
Then is reading the newspaper getting another 
shocks after shocks from the newspaper then

311
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:43,250
he gets into the car and there is jam and 
he does not know how to drive and all that.

312
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,870
He is a sure patient for leukemia.

313
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:55,299
Because poor this spleen has to produce new 
blood corpuscles all the time and it becomes

314
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:56,299
hectic.

315
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:57,299
Now you may question me, why the children 
get it?

316
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,299
Because the parents must be like that.

317
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:00,620
This is the parents also who can make the 
children hectic.

318
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:06,200
Get up in the morning, go to the school, what 
are you doing, this, that..all the time if

319
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,789
you are after your child with a stick in your 
hand, the child is due for it.

320
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:18,110
A mother, who is you see too clever, at home 
and very particular about her kitchen and

321
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:24,460
cleanliness of the whole thing and she can 
get after her child.

322
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:30,379
And such a thing completely upsets that poor 
spleen.

323
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:33,950
And the production of RBCs use their cells 
of proportion.

324
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,400
Of Course there is a trigery.

325
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,580
And the trigering takes place as the doctors 
call it, I mean recently i saw it that they

326
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,289
call it by Proteins 52 and Proteins 58.

327
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:48,049
That they call it, these are attacks.

328
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:53,340
This recently I saw it in England, the research, 
the cancer research people had given this

329
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,789
(unclear text) explanation.

330
00:22:55,789 --> 00:23:01,899
And they said it comes from the areas built 
within us from of our creation.

331
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:04,759
And we call it collective subconsious.

332
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,590
In Sahaja Yoga we call it collective subconsious.

333
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:14,409
Beyond our conscious mind there is subconscious 
mind and beyond the subconsious mind there

334
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:20,100
is collective subconscious mind on the left 
hand side.

335
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,149
Now, according to them these are Proteins 
52 and 58 whatever you may call it.

336
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:30,400
Whatever you may call it but we call it a 
“bhoot badha”(posession), a simple word.

337
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,450
Or you may call it a “kali-vidya” (black 
magic or false knowledge) or whatever it is.

338
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:40,820
But it is nothing but it is an attack of a 
dead soul on a person.

339
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,549
Absolutely, it exists.

340
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:45,620
And that is how it triggers.

341
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:57,080
Now virus infection is also the attack of 
the vegetables, we can or the vegetations

342
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,690
which have gone out the circulation of your 
evolution.

343
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,080
That’s virus infection.

344
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,799
I mean, if you know the source from where 
it is coming, you can stop it, isn’t it?

345
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:11,090
Now, doctors can’t believe a bhoot but once 
they are caught up with a bhoot, they know

346
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,780
it is a bhoot.

347
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,470
Like a met a doctor, was a in in charge of 
the hospital and his son was possessed.

348
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,970
So he came to me and said, “Mother, please 
somehow or the other, save my son.

349
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,710
I don’t know what to do.” and I cured 
him.

350
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,029
He said, “how did you cure?”.

351
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:27,730
I said its simple, he is possessed.

352
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:30,549
And he was possessed by something and is removed.

353
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:31,549
Its simple.

354
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:34,880
But to tell a doctor, I mean you are in for 
trouble.

355
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,440
But its a fact.

356
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,380
Believe me, it’s a fact.

357
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:43,960
The triggering they have said about 52 and 
58, I mean call it anything like auto to call

358
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,570
to “Atma” you call it auto.

359
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,570
Alright.

360
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,570
So what can we do about it?

361
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:53,600
Or if you call it to a “bhoot-badha” as 
protein 52 and 58, what should we do?

362
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:00,269
I mean you have more sophisticated names perhaps 
but its simple like that.

363
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:07,770
So once a person has that kind of wobbly spleen, 
he is a good case.

364
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,559
He is a good case for getting leukemia.

365
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:18,720
Now let’s come to the best part of it, what 
one can get ultimately.

366
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,020
That, when your attention is so much outside 
then your spirit in the heart gets upset and

367
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,860
you get a heart attack.

368
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,270
All heart attacks are due to this kind of 
thing.

369
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:38,529
There are two types of hearts; Heart diseases 
according to Sahaja Yoga.

370
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:39,570
It’s very simple.

371
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:42,750
One is a lethargic heart and one is over active 
heart.

372
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:51,519
The over active heart gets a heart attack 
when, whether you are thin or fat makes no

373
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,519
difference.

374
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:58,630
The lethargic heart may be from the fat but 
the active heart, the one who is extremely

375
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,630
active.

376
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:04,179
All the time thinking of the future and all 
that is in for a heart attack.

377
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:07,610
It’s so simple as that.

378
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,659
So now, you have to just give a balance to 
a person.

379
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:13,529
Who is a right sided, you give him a balance.

380
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:17,820
Make left and right, he is cured.

381
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:24,600
When you know the “tatwa”, the principle-how 
you get diseases then can you not cure it,

382
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,369
if you know how to cure the “tatwa”?

383
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:29,340
Sahaja yoga is like that.

384
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,480
Sahaja yoga knows the principle and principles 
are a few.

385
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,450
Like colors are very few.

386
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,450
Isn’t it?

387
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,450
The mixtures are there.

388
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,980
Permutations and combinations are there.

389
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:46,070
But if you know the principle, you just put 
the principle right and the person is alright.

390
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:53,679
Like the person (unclear text) was going to 
Houston for a By-pass(surgery) and I was speaking

391
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,230
in a Rotary Club, in Delhi.

392
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,749
There were about two thousand people.

393
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:03,649
Suddenly he (text1-shot up/text2- stood up) 
came to me and said, “Mother I have to go

394
00:27:03,649 --> 00:27:04,649
to Houston”.

395
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:07,160
I said but I am flying out today to Bombay 
to go to Pune.

396
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,190
I have to go to Pune.

397
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,480
He said, “I live in Pune”.

398
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,059
I said, Alright, I’ll meet you there.

399
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:16,330
He came to see me twice, I think and I gave 
him vibrations then he went back to Bombay

400
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,840
and all the doctors said, “Oh!

401
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
What happened?

402
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,470
These were not your, perhaps these were not 
your X-rays or what?

403
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,470
Its completely cured.

404
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,210
100% and all that By-pass and all that is 
over.

405
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,619
And for this, what are you going to pay?

406
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,590
This is just flowing.

407
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,419
I mean you are also not obliging anyone.

408
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:39,400
That’s the worst part of it that people 
think I am obliging.

409
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
No.

410
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,710
See, if you are part and parcel of me, say 
for example My finger is something wrong and

411
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:50,049
I just rub it then I am obliging my finger?

412
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:52,340
I mean if you are part and parcel of me how 
can I oblige you?

413
00:27:52,340 --> 00:28:01,649
That’s what they were saying that you have 
to become the part and parcel of the whole.

414
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:03,710
You just become part and parcel of the whole.

415
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,029
The arbitrary behaviour becomes malignant.

416
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:14,190
Arbitrary behaviour of a cell becomes malignancy.

417
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,139
Because the centers, now I will tell you about 
cancer also on the same simple way.

418
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:21,580
See, its a simple way of explaining cancer.

419
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,580
Any cancer.

420
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:28,950
Now, we can say that, with my hands I might 
be able to show you that left hand and right

421
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,582
hand are two sympathetic nervous systems and 
these are the centers in between.

422
00:28:32,582 --> 00:28:33,582
You can see that.

423
00:28:33,582 --> 00:28:34,582
(Shri Mataji makes a pyramid with her fingers 
and joins the thumbs and index fingers of

424
00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:35,582
both the hands to show the position.)

425
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:36,582
Alright.

426
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:37,582
These are the centers.

427
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:41,740
Now, what happens..a person starts a doing 
something extraordinary.

428
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,429
Something emergency he creates within himself.

429
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:46,409
It can be with anything.

430
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:51,730
Now he creates an emergency uses too much 
of his sympathetic supposing he uses the right

431
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,730
side too much.

432
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,250
Then what happens is this starts wobbling 
like that.

433
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,620
(Shri MAtaji shows this with her hands) this 
center.

434
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:05,539
And the center starts wobbling and the, there 
is a deity inside this which keeps the relationship

435
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:06,539
with the whole.

436
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:10,639
The deity just sleeps off and the relationship 
is broken.

437
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:16,630
The relationship with the whole is broken 
because the medulla oblongata has got you

438
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:22,399
see, inside though to the physical mind it 
has not broken but to the subtle thing, is

439
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,399
finished.

440
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:24,399
There is no relationship with the whole.

441
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,480
So what happens, the cells here have no messages.

442
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,940
So they become on their own.

443
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,190
And they start becoming bigger and bigger.

444
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,190
They become on their own.

445
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,700
You see, they become very ambitious.They start 
growing bigger and bigger.

446
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,100
That’s how you get malignancy.

447
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,100
Simple thing as that.

448
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,591
Now what do we do for Sahaja Yoga. it is very 
simple.

449
00:29:42,591 --> 00:29:47,429
If you are a realized soul what you have to 
do is very simple is to just put your hand

450
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:48,749
to the center at the back.

451
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:52,450
So by giving vibrations you awaken the deity 
and its again sucked back.

452
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,789
You have put together in relationship with 
the whole.

453
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:03,289
I mean, I must tell you I cured Mr. Sanjeev 
Reddy, you may write to him and ask him.

454
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:09,190
Now he had come from America he had gone for 
an operation and the operation was a failure.

455
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,470
And he was in a horrible mess.

456
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:14,500
He could not sleep and he was in a big pain 
and they tried all kinds of injections and

457
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,820
I mean you can imagine Sanjeev Reddy (unclear 
text) I went with my husband to see him because

458
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,820
he knew my husband.

459
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,029
He knew me also.

460
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,690
But our high commissioner was * Nehru and 
I don’t know why he said to his wife, “you

461
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:31,259
know, this is Mataji Nirmala Devi” She had 
heard my name in Delhi.

462
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:36,119
She said, “Mataji please cure my husband” 
otherwise my husband is not going to say anything.

463
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,630
So I just put my hand on his back, for ten 
minutes.

464
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,440
You won’t believe, in ten minutes.

465
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
Oh God!

466
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,299
I am feeling so relaxed, let me sleep now.

467
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:48,230
He slept off and they were thinking...I mean 
it was all last thing.

468
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:53,970
See, so they had prepared everything that 
they didn’t expect him to come alive.

469
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,230
And when walked out they got a shock of their 
lives.

470
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,379
You see, they had brought ambulances, he said 
“I don’t need any ambulance, nothing.

471
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:01,710
And just walked off,you see.

472
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,590
And then he went on for a tour.

473
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,999
And then when i went to see him, he showed 
me his back.

474
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:13,590
He said, “even the scratches, which one 
should see atleast a scratch of the operation.

475
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:17,019
Even there is not even a scratch, you can’t 
see.

476
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:18,019
Imagine.

477
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:20,639
The kundalini has done it.

478
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:24,429
The kundalini is your mother.

479
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:26,710
She is the one, sitting down there.

480
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,879
Just waiting this thing to happen.

481
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:31,299
Because she is your “Shudha icha” (pure 
desire).

482
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:33,460
She is the pure desire.

483
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,399
The rest are “Vikrutas”.

484
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:36,850
They are perverted.

485
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:41,529
The real desire one has is to become one with 
God.

486
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:45,679
unless and until that desire is fulfilled 
you are not going to be happy.

487
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,250
So that desire is sitting down there.

488
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,639
She is your mother.

489
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:51,919
Everybody has individual mother.

490
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,460
And when this pure desire rises, she integrates 
all these centers.

491
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,769
That’s how you get integrated.

492
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:04,090
And then she comes upto here (Shri Mataji 
touches her Sahastrara) and you can even feel.

493
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,460
In many people the “lup-dup” you see.

494
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,960
“Anahat”, anahat means without percussion.

495
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,869
The sound you hear on the head.

496
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:18,539
You can even see in many people the kundalini 
pulsating.

497
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:21,059
Actually with naked eyes you can see.

498
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:28,269
Today only, we had somebody who had a kundalini 
which was just pulsating at the base.

499
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:31,419
If there is no way of getting out, pulsates.

500
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:36,879
Poor thing, you know it just...some people 
have just kundalini that just goes on tossing

501
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:42,169
that “oh God, when I am going to give birth 
to my child.”

502
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:43,390
and then.

503
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,620
If you can smooth it out, bring it out.

504
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,620
It just comes up.

505
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:50,139
And then you feel a cool breeze coming out 
of your head.

506
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:52,080
Which is not possible medically.

507
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,009
Is it possible?

508
00:32:54,009 --> 00:33:00,370
You feel a cool breeze coming out of your 
head, you feel cool breeze blowing into your

509
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,370
hands.

510
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,370
Then, this is the power.

511
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,370
Which is the all-pervading power.

512
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:06,610
The “Brahma-tatwa” which you can use.

513
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,850
Which is all integrated.

514
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:14,450
In Sahaja Yoga language we call it Mahakali, 
Mahalaxmi, Mahasaraswati.

515
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:19,679
Then you understand, what was Mohammed Saa’b, 
what was Zoraster, what was Christ, who they

516
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,679
are.

517
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:21,679
Everything we understand.

518
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,940
They are all integrated, we are only people 
fighting among ourselves.

519
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,779
And it works out so beautifully you can’t 
imagine.

520
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:34,090
I wish, all of you get your realization and 
work it out.

521
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,580
I would like to answer your questions, if 
you have any please ask me.

522
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,679
And then let’s have it.

523
00:33:41,679 --> 00:34:11,830
(Shri Mataji finishes her lecture and sits 
down at the chair)

524
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,830
Someone from the audience:- Inaudible text.

525
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,830
Shri Mataji in hindi:- What are they saying?

526
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,830
Yogi:- Can any accidents can occur in Kundalini?

527
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,070
Shri Mataji:- No, no not in this.

528
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:20,780
You see, now there are people who have written 
books and books about kundalini.

529
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,710
I was myself shocked you know when I read 
them.

530
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,710
It’s all absurd.

531
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:28,940
You see a person who does not know how to 
handle even a scalper and tries to operate

532
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,080
someone, what will happen?

533
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,210
That’s what it is.

534
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,270
Audience:- Inaudible.

535
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:38,420
Shri MAtaji:- No, kundalini process there 
are no accidents, nothing.

536
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,169
Nothing happens like that.

537
00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:50,510
I am just telling that these are Naive people 
who do not know how to handle it.

538
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,280
Alright!

539
00:34:52,280 --> 00:35:04,270
Audience:- They are saying now that guru is 
needed for all this yoga and (* unclear text.)

540
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:10,140
Shri MAtaji:- They are saying because they 
don’t know how to do it.

541
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:16,300
Supposing somebody says, “oh you see, Medical 
Science is horrible, don’t go near it.”

542
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,140
Because they don’t about it what can you 
do?

543
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,790
It’s like putting your fingers in the plug 
and saying that electricity is shocking.

544
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,160
You must know the thing.

545
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:36,540
First of all and secondly such a person has 
to be a person of character.

546
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:46,530
You see a man who is taking money from you, 
God does not give blessings to such a man.

547
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,530
Isn’t it?

548
00:35:47,530 --> 00:36:05,760
Or he is trying to make money out of you or 
he is trying to be...he is a bad character

549
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:22,610
man, is a horrible man and he has….you know 
“paapi man” (sinner) you can call it.

550
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:28,190
Such a person can not do it.

551
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,710
He doesn’t do it.

552
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:32,220
These are all money making propositions.

553
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,500
And it is only Shri Ganesha who gets angry.

554
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,580
Not kundalini.

555
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:53,130
Poor thing she does not do anything but it 
is the anger of Shri Ganesha which works on

556
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,130
the sympathetic.

557
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,130
That also you will know, what happens.

558
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,130
Audience:- (Unclear text) bhakti in Sahaja 
Yoga?

559
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,130
Shri Mataji:- Bhakti?

560
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,130
Bhakti is very important.

561
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,130
I mean if you believe in God, then God looks 
after you.

562
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,130
But Bhakti can be an extreme step also.

563
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,130
Like you are calling, “God, God” when 
the God stands before you still you are calling

564
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,130
God.

565
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,130
You see that is too much.

566
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,130
Isn’t it?

567
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,130
Like, Tulsidasa he wrote so much about Ramayana 
and all that.

568
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:10,140
But when Shri Rama came to him and he also 
gave him a (unclear) still he could not recognize

569
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,140
him.

570
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,140
So what’s the use of such a blind bhakti.

571
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,140
It should not be blind.

572
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,140
It should be from heart.

573
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,140
Very important.

574
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,140
If somebody is a man who has done bhakti from 
his heart he gets Sahaja Yoga very fast.

575
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,140
But actually, now I have seen in Sahaja Yoga 
has become so powerful that everyone gets

576
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,140
realization.

577
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,140
Not difficult.

578
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,140
Everyone gets it, not difficult.

579
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,140
In the villages if you see six thousand people 
sitting, all will raise hands.

580
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,140
But the complicated and rather difficult (unclear 
text) or if you have some disease.

581
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,140
That also you can make out on the kundalini 
but and also there kundalini stops.

582
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,140
You’ll be amazed if there is somebody.

583
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,140
Say comes to me and he has a liver problem 
then the kundalini goes and she goes on hitting

584
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,140
the liver you see.

585
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,400
And even a person who does not understands 
that liver is there, he puts his hand and

586
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,970
there because he sees the kundalini hitting 
there.

587
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:35,040
So it just shows where the problem is.

588
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,580
Even if you don’t understand any medicine 
you will know where the problem is because

589
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,900
you know the kundalini will go and start hitting 
that point.

590
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:48,490
And you will see with your naked eyes.

591
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:55,550
Audience: How would you explain the pulsation 
of the head in kundalini, please?

592
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,650
Shri MAtaji:- Sahastrara you mean?

593
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,620
Audience:- According to A* (unclear text) 
because as we know in case of an adult…

594
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,610
Shri Mataji:- See, I’ll tell you.

595
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:10,760
In the brain you see, where the pituitary 
and pineal body, in the center of that you

596
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,910
can say the optic chaisma.

597
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,080
There is a very subtle center called Agya 
Chakra.

598
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,910
Which is very important.

599
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,320
Which goes on working when you think too much.

600
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:28,380
And the backside is the one which is surrounded 
by, you see..I would say that the limbic area

601
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,380
has got all the seven chakras.

602
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,720
All the seven chakras within it.

603
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,250
All the seven chakras limbic area has.

604
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,730
But they are called as the “Pithas”.

605
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,240
Pitahs means the seats of the chakras.

606
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,250
So all these chakras are represented in our 
brain.

607
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,250
Alright.

608
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,400
In the limbic area.

609
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:48,720
Now out of that this agya chakra is genuinely 
here and the pitha is also here.

610
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,320
The outside, this is the window of that agya 
chakra which is in the center of pitutary

611
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,810
and pineal and it controls pituitary and pineal.

612
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,810
Alright.

613
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:06,910
Now, at the back side of it, it has only two 
windows so it is here and here at the back.

614
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:11,280
And surrounding that, surrounding is Swadhisthana 
Chakra.

615
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,380
The same one i told you about working poor 
thing which has to work very hard.

616
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:21,360
Now this one, when you get diabetes what happens 
that the swadhisthana goes out of order and

617
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,190
that’s how you get blind.

618
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,010
Because swadisthana is surrounding this.

619
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,010
Here.

620
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,360
so all the seven chakras are in the limbic 
area.

621
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,360
Is very interesting.

622
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,090
Yogi:- He said that how do you get the pulsation 
here? (he points his hand to sahastrara)

623
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,090
Shri Mataji:- Pulsation here?

624
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,090
Pulsation you said?

625
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,090
Yogi:- Yes.

626
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,720
Shri Mataji:- because the kundalini rises, 
she crosses through this (Shri MAtaji points

627
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,030
to the Agya Chara) and then you start feeling 
the pulsation.

628
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,660
Because it is trying to break through.

629
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,164
When it breaks, then you get the, that’s 
how you get the pulsation.

630
00:39:49,164 --> 00:39:52,940
You can even with the stethoscope hear the 
pulsation on the different chakras to begin

631
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,330
with then ultimately here you get the pulsation.

632
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,330
Then it breaks, you see.

633
00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:00,820
The thing it becomes, you know fontanelle 
bone area becomes soft.

634
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,730
Just like a child’s fontanelle bone.

635
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:07,990
In a person who is bald headed, sometimes 
you see the whole thing opening out like that

636
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:13,600
and then you feel the cool breeze coming out.

637
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:21,990
Pause 
Shri MAtaji:- So should we have realization?

638
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,090
Let’s try.

639
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,240
(unclear text) Alright.

640
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:33,530
Take out your shoes, that’s it.

641
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,880
Because the Mother Earth helps us.

642
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,880
You see these are all the five elements which 
have gone upside down.

643
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,880
That’s all.

644
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
Just take out your shoes.

645
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,880
That’s all.

646
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,880
Is very simple.

647
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
Anybody can get no problem.

648
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,880
According to these western people, Indians 
are very easy.

649
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:54,600
They are a very quality of people.

650
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:00,520
They are dharmic and they are very great, 
according to them.

651
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:06,630
And I must also confess that I really break 
my hands in the west.

652
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,110
In India, I must say, they know it very well.

653
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,760
They have to break also.

654
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,210
Not only me.

655
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,210
They have to do the same.

656
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:16,170
So they are very happy here because giving 
realization to Indians is very easy.

657
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,720
But giving realization to western people is 
very difficult.

658
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,260
So they also have suffered all of them.

659
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,960
So they will stand by me.

660
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,811
(unclear text) they all have, they all know 
that this is the (bhoot?/Unclear) because

661
00:41:24,811 --> 00:41:26,800
they are very complicated.

662
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,890
Extremely complicated.

663
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,880
So many attacks have come to them that they 
are complicated, thinking is too much.

664
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,375
Like this fellow “Freud” has to (Unclear)wrong 
ideas into their heads.

665
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:44,300
And there is “Bawa” and all this nonsense 
and who was that...what was the unholdy trinity

666
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,050
you were talking about?

667
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,370
Where is he?

668
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,370
Bryan?

669
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,560
“Freud nature of (God/gardener)..

670
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,990
{Laughter, Shri MAtaji laughs then says a 
sentence in Marathi}

671
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:56,740
Shri Mataji:- Ah, that’s it.

672
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,632
You see, that’s it, that’s how they have 
been attacked.

673
00:42:00,632 --> 00:42:01,720
And they accepted all this.

674
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:07,330
You see, we may be educated in western education 
but we don’t forget about God.

675
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:13,110
I mean think about God as a part of us and 
dharma is within us.

676
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:19,640
(Shri Mataji says something in Marathi) and 
even Indians if they take to adharmic life

677
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,820
they still remember that this is adharmic.

678
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,100
But for them it has become so difficult to 
remember that this is dharmic, adharmic.

679
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,110
That’s an another world.

680
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,170
Another world, you (unclear) with them nothing 
is dharma.

681
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,170
Is poor thing you know.

682
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:37,130
They have been attacked so much and they are 
all saints born.

683
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,891
Surprising part is that they have been saints 
they were born in such countries where there

684
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:46,010
was affluence and they are attacked.

685
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,090
These are saints, definitely.

686
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:53,330
And those who are seekers there are tremendous 
seekers.

687
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:59,190
I mean you will be amazed these people, they 
have been druggists and alcoholics and all

688
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,190
sorts of people.

689
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,190
But the day they get realization next day 
they give up.

690
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,190
Indians don’t.

691
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,190
(Everyone laughs.)

692
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,190
Indians are chickens.

693
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,190
They don’t.

694
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,190
(Laughter, everyone laughs with Mother) I 
must say.

695
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,190
Na, Indians don’t you know so easily.

696
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,220
They do it, they are saints.

697
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:15,410
(pointing towards western yogies) this is 
the quality that way is very good.

698
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:18,410
But on the whole, you see totality.

699
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:22,340
I am saying, in general, it’s horrible.

700
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,340
But they are saints.

701
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:27,000
Because the way they give up their things 
is amazing.

702
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,120
Here, you give realization.

703
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,840
(Marathi sentence something about the habit 
of having tobacco) it’s like that.

704
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,100
You see, they stick on to something.

705
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,380
I don’t know why, these people just give 
up.

706
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,380
Overnight!

707
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,380
They are very determined.

708
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,750
That’s how thing is there.

709
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:45,570
I mean that goes in their favour and this 
goes in your favour.

710
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:49,860
My condition is that some people don’t have 
teeth, and some people don’t have “chanas”

711
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,050
(roasted chickpeas) and some people don’t 
have chanas and they have teeth.

712
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,250
It’s like that.

713
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,260
So it’s a funny situation.

714
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,260
Alright.

715
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,260
So let’s have it.

716
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:03,160
Now you don’t have to be serious about it, 
nothing but it is a very serene thing.

717
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,370
It’s not serious but serene.

718
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,370
Just put your hands like this.

719
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:10,420
(Shri Mataji opens her palms to show) that’s 
all and close your eyes that’s all.

720
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,960
That’s all.

721
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:17,370
Just put your hands straight like this.

722
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:18,370
Straight!

723
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,080
I think better to take out your spectacles 
put them.

724
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,080
This also helps your eyes very much.

725
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,080
Spectacles you may remove later on.

726
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:27,440
Just, it’s so fantastic to (continue/unclear 
text) It’s another world I am talking about.

727
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,440
Hmm…

728
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,280
Just close your eyes please.
