1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,160
You praise Indians very much and I also praise with you.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,680
But we have certain very bad qualities, and one of them is

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,520
that we are very extremely untidy people.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,640
Our aesthetics are so horribly made

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,119

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,440
that we don't understand the difference between a plastic bag

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,480
and a silver jug,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,920
such jumbled up things we have.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,720
And I think I would request you to

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,880
insist on arranging things yourself,

11
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:31,480
because then they will pick up and learn things that it is to be done.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,600
You have to learn a lot of things from them,

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,240
but they have to also learn some things from you,

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,640
and they are very important things.

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,520
Because it all makes a coefficients, it makes an atmosphere,

16
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,120
and a pleasing thing for the Gods.

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,000
But this is the character of an Indian, Indian character,

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
that whatever is wrong, wherever, whatever is the condition, carry on.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,400
See no evil.

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,440
Speak no evil.  It's like that.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,520
If anything is bad, let it be as it is.

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,080
Let it rust, let it - absolutely till it becomes so rotten,

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,680
that it is going to fall on your head,

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,040
then you may put a little support.

25
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,960
That's our character.

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,880
We're too tolerant with everything,

27
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,360
and that has led us to this kind of a

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,680
incapacity to work.

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,040
But if you see the ritambhara pragya, see the ritambhara pragya,

30
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,240
how she works,

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,840
how she beautifully does everything,

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,640
how she creates everything so beautifully.

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,880
There's so much neatness if you go to a jungle,

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,200
you will not find anything dirty, filthy, smelling - nothing.

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,480
Everything washed up, cleaned up.

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,120
The nature works in beautiful circles.

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,560
Everything works out so much beautifully,

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,760
that when we call ourselves "natural"

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,560
we should understand that ritambhara pragya is the most natural thing.

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,520
And how ritambhara pragya works is with complete neatness

41
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,960
and complete cleanliness of the whole thing.

42
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,280
Indians will be personally very, very clean,

43
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,280
extremely clean they are, no doubt.

44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,200
But collectively they don't understand cleanliness.

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,840
If you see their roads, if you see their

46
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,720
outside of the houses, it's all dirty.

47
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,440
And that is what I will blame our Indian men,

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,840
you see, they are extremely

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,840
conscious that they are human beings.

50
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,600
You see, we have only two races in India:

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,080
Women and men.

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,800
There is no third race.

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,280
Men are not supposed to do any work, inside, outside, anywhere.

54
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,960
They don't see to the outside of the house.

55
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,520
Like in England I find men are

56
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,360
all the time doing the sweeping, swabbing, everything outside.

57
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,560
They do mowing of the lawn, looking after the garden, everything.

58
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
Here the men will be just standing

59
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,920
with their hands on their waist

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,000
and ordering the wives, or if not the wife,

61
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,720
the servants and all that.

62
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,320
And whatever may be, the wife may be dominating

63
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,480
as far as money is concerned,

64
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,080
but all these things the man is not going to do.

65
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,440
He'll just give up.  He'll say:

66
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,640
"I am not supposed to do all these things."

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,400
That's why collectively in this country

68
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,800
we can never be clean people,

69
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,560
because our men will just sit down.

70
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,320
They won't do anything, just they won't do anything.

71
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,040
Only the women are supposed to do everything,

72
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,040
and that's how our collective cleanliness is zero, absolute zero.

73
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,560
For example, if there's a WC not working in England,

74
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,920
I can't think of any man who will sit down for five minutes.

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,520
He'll himself do it, he'll get a plumber,

76
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,520
he'll do somehow or other, try to manage.

77
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,240
Here, it's not all right - doesn't matter:

78
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,600
It's all right.

79
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,840
No, see no evil - manage.

80
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,680
This is how we have lived all centuries now I think,

81
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,880
and it's high time for all Sahaja yogis to change themselves.

82
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,560
Now, here there are many artists sitting in this part,

83
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,720
but the men are not doing anything - puja the women are doing.

84
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
And the women don't know anything how to do it,

85
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,640
so the whole thing can be absolutely wretched.

86
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,800
It is not, it is a sort of a

87
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,200
character with us, we do this way.

88
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,640
But otherwise we have so many qualities.

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,280
We have so many qualities, that

90
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,640
you can't imagine how much we have got through our traditions.

91
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,800
We are very humble people, we are

92
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,480
extremely loving, affectionate,

93
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,840
we'll go to any extent to serve others.

94
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,720
We are not cunning people, we are not meticulous, we don't calculate.

95
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,360
We are very hospitable.

96
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,240
All these things are there, no doubt.

97
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,280
But these things, that we have to learn from you,

98
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,160
it's maybe gross, to look at it looks gross, but it's not.

99
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,000
Just now as you see that if it is properly done, if it is

100
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,280
nicely done, I mean, at least I feel very much pleased with it.

101
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,560
And everybody feels pleased about it.

102
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,560
And when somebody sees the film also, they'll be pleased to see

103
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,000
this find of a film where there's something sensibly

104
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,560
put up and everything is nicely done, care has been taken.

105
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,079
Also shows a kind of a understanding,

106
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,160
that this is the worship of the Adi Shakti,

107
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,560
and you cannot take liberties with it.

108
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,040
Imagine, in these ordinary temples

109
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,000
they spend so much money - even the walls, the doors,

110
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
the windows, everything made of silver.

111
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,360
They do so much to create that.

112
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,920
But if you people miss it - the Indians, I am saying -

113
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,480
then it's going to be very dangerous for you.

114
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,200
One must understand that you cannot just play about - just:

115
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,720
"Mother is coming"  -  Nobody came to even call Me.

116
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,040
Somebody should have come to call Me - I just walked on Myself.

117
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,880
Here, this is not the way to behave,

118
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,440
and the Indians must learn these things,

119
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,280
that somebody must come to call Me!

120
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,640
After all, you see,

121
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,080
all these protocols they are going to learn from you,

122
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
from the Indians;

123
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,680
and if you don't have any protocol about it,

124
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,920
how are they going to get it?

125
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,440
So this is what one has to understand,

126
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,480
that as English have to learn

127
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,040
from French and French have to learn from Germans,

128
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,360
and Germans have to learn from,

129
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
say, Austrians,

130
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,480
or Austrians have to learn from Swiss, whatever it is.

131
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,400
It's very important,

132
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,480
that the Indians must learn from the Western people.

133
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,920
Certain things, that the way they respect their women -

134
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,600
first of all that:

135
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,960
The way they respect their women.

136
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,600
Of course, one should not go to that limit

137
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,880
that the women just dominate, all the time.

138
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,040
I mean, American women are,

139
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,960
I have seen about women, they are horrible.

140
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,120
But still, I would say that one must learn,

141
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,520
must learn how to respect the women.

142
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,040
Women are human beings.

143
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,920
Your Mother is a woman,

144
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,080
and you must learn how to respect a woman.

145
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,840
And if you don't know how to respect the woman,

146
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,320
then in this country I'm sure

147
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,920
there cannot be bliss, whatever you may try.

148
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,160
So the men must learn that,

149
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,920
they must know how to talk to their sisters,

150
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,560
to their mothers, to their wives.

151
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,720
But if there's a woman who is dominating,

152
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,520
you see, if there's a dominating woman,

153
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,040
then she becomes a prime minister in this country.

154
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
That's what we are.

155
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,560
If you get a dominating woman then she can manage.

156
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,079
If she's a simple woman, she's good, she's religious,

157
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,400
she's submissive, then she's finished.

158
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,800
If she's dominating, then men are afraid of such women.

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,520
This is very sad and that gives a very bad images.

160
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,680
So I feel that as Ritambhara Pragya works out everything so well;

161
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,800
in the nature if you see how she beautifully creates everything,

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
how she chooses things, how she places things,

163
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,760
how the colors change.

164
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,440
You'll never find anything loud, anything obstructing,

165
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,280
anything that is destructive, vulgar, new - nothing.

166
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,960
Find everything so beautifully done,

167
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,480
that it creates an inspiration in a human mind,

168
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,160
in a human heart which can be of a stone also.

169
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,160
Even French, you see, they get

170
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,720
inspired by Ritambhara Pragya.

171
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,800
So you can imagine people with stone hearts

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,840
can get inspired,

173
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,560
people who have very funny ideas about human beings

174
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,240
can get inspired by Ritambhara Pragya.

175
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,360
So why not

176
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,880
we, the Sahaja Yogis, should get inspiration

177
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,360
from Ritambhara Pragya,

178
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,760
and try to make everything look

179
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,120
nice, beautiful, and must have coefficients

180
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,200
by which we can have

181
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,720
the proper channel for our vibrations.

182
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,560
And this is what I feel is lacking

183
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,160
in the coordination between East and West.

184
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,960
Let us give them this simple thing

185
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,000
as to understand

186
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,840
how you respect your women,

187
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,120
how you respect the aesthetics,

188
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,520
how you look after things.

189
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,280
I know in London, supposing I have to have a Puja,

190
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,600
I don't want to see these things at all.

191
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,120
On the contrary, I am enamored the way things are done - always.

192
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,480
Here also they work out, I'm not saying always,

193
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,720
but it could have been much better little bit,

194
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,040
because a film has to be done and all that.

195
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,960
But this is the trouble is that

196
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,080
in our everyday look,

197
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,480
outlook, we are like that.

198
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
You will see that everywhere you go in the villages

199
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,480
the problem is, there are bathrooms, there are WCs,

200
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,560
but never repaired.

201
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,600
Once spoiled means spoiled once for all.

202
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,080
Telephone is spoiled, it's spoiled forever.

203
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,440
At least in America people will go and buy; they will not repair.

204
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,720
They will go and buy new one.

205
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,120
Here they will not buy new one,

206
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,760
nor they will have any replacement -

207
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,720
carry on with it throughout.

208
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,640
That is a very bad character we have got, which we must change.

209
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,560
We should try to see everything is working all right.

210
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,120
Now, come to the Kundalini,

211
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,280
supposing the Kundalini goes out of order.

212
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,080
Are we going to give it up?

213
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,200
If one chakra is not good, are we going to give it up?

214
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,880
If there's something wrong with -

215
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:15,720
that point Indians are very particular,

216
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,440
much more than the Western -

217
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,960
if the kundalini is out, they'll get after it.

218
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,720
If one chakra is out, they'll get after it, they'll clean it.

219
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,400
Because they are the roots, you see,

220
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
and the root doesn't bother about the beauty;

221
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,480
but the tree has to look after the beauty.

222
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,320
So this is a combination which has to be worked out properly

223
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,320
by you both.

224
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,640
And the things will work out very well, I think,

225
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,880
if you understand

226
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,880
what co-relationship you have with each other,

227
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,440
what you have to learn from them

228
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,080
and what they have to learn from you.

229
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Now, today is a special day I thought of having a Puja,

230
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,680
because today is the moon - just see, in front of Me here -

231
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,360
and today is the day, first day, the moon is waxing.

232
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,720
In the science of Sahaja Yoga,

233
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,680
the moon is the spirit in our heart.

234
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,240
It is the spirit in our heart,

235
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
meaning in Marathi "Purnantara",

236
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,120
is the spirit in our heart,

237
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,640
and it shines when the sun

238
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,720
reflects on it.

239
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,720
When the sun - the sun,

240
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,040
that is the Son of God.

241
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,600
When the Son of God reflects on the heart,

242
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,680
then the moon shines in the human heart.

243
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,080
But when it shines as a moon,

244
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,480
then Shiva Himself lifts it up

245
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,640
and puts it on His head.

246
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,040
So the human beings

247
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,079
who are

248
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,120
blessed by the Son of God,

249
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,440
who are being

250
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,280
awakened by the Son of God,

251
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,080
that is you can say that

252
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,640
it is Shri Ganesh

253
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,200
or Lord Jesus Christ,

254
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,800
any one of them,

255
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,280
if they enlighten the heart of human beings,

256
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,080
then it becomes a shining moon.

257
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,320
And the "amavasya", the day

258
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,440
when it's the dark night,

259
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,000
is when a man is not a realized soul at all.

260
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,480
The realized soul is like the full moon.

261
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Now today is the day

262
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,440
when the moon is slightly,

263
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,320
one degree less.

264
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,960
It's a important day for us

265
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,720
because this is the first day

266
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,640
when it is waxing.

267
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,960
And that is the day we have to fix up our

268
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,840
moon within ourselves,

269
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,800
that we start waxing

270
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,840
by degrees.

271
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,640
Into sixteen degrees we to go on waxing.

272
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,440
And when that happens we don't realize,

273
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,760
that there is no shining.

274
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,440
The shining is going out.

275
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,120
And we have to be careful,

276
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,720
we have to look after it,

277
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,160
and we have to work it out

278
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,920
so that we worship that day when it starts waxing.

279
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,520
It can wax with many things.

280
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,840
You see, we have so many ways of finishing off

281
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,040
the light that God has given us in our heart,

282
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,400
that is the spirit.

283
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,120
One of them is,

284
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,120
very great one, is the thinking,

285
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,680
that we do about it.

286
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,680
The first it starts when we start thinking about it,

287
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,480
rationalizing about it.

288
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,080
You must know that when I speak,

289
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,600
I don't speak - actually these are all mantras,

290
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,040
and whatever I do,

291
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,400
I work it out in such a way

292
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,240
that what I'm saying works out within you.

293
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,920
It's the Krita Yuga, and it works out.

294
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,120
When I say that, the whole machinery gets geared up.

295
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,640
So when I say something,

296
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,960
if you start reflecting it in your mind you are gone,

297
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,800
because you are not receiving what I am trying to do.

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,200
If it is a mantra,

299
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,080
that means whatever I am saying,

300
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,800
those sound waves will create

301
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,520
that being within you

302
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,920
that I am describing.

303
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,000
So at that time, once you start thinking about it

304
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,160
you cannot receive it,

305
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,920
because you have put a barrier of your thought.

306
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,320
So when I'm talking, just try to receive it.

307
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,240
Just say "yes, yes" inside,

308
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,320
so that you receive it within yourself.

309
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,400
So this is one of the greatest problems of today,

310
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,080
is that whatever you say

311
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,640
everybody must answer,

312
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,560
everybody must argue,

313
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,600
everybody must say,

314
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,360
"No, this could be that way, that could be,

315
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,120
there are alternatives, this, that"  -  everything goes on.

316
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,280
There is no need at all to do all that.

317
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,880
And when you start doing that,

318
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,800
then all the Gods and Goddesses get angry one by one,

319
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,560
and that's how you start losing your light within yourself.

320
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,400
So this is the most displeasing thing

321
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
for Gods and Goddesses,

322
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,760
that you don't recognize Me.

323
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,000
That you don't recognize Me fully.

324
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,040
That you still argue with Me.

325
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Still you start asking questions.

326
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,840
Still you start giving Me alternatives.

327
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,720
Absolutely, this is just not necessary

328
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,760
for you to go on arguing,

329
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,200
to go on discussing it.

330
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,120
It is just that you assimilate

331
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,480
whatever I am saying,

332
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,720
and that assimilation itself

333
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,040
will open out those new dimensions within you,

334
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,200
which God wants to be opened out.

335
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,600
So better surrender in that way your ego.

336
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,400
Ego is the one that makes you say something,

337
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,360
argue something, discuss something.

338
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,320
And this is what is the biggest problem,

339
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,440
what that I have seen

340
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,920
when the first day of the waxing starts.

341
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,440
So today is the first day when we should say that,

342
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,680
that our ego should not start that drooping down.

343
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,720
It was nice to dance, enjoy, everything,

344
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,280
but then when you sit down -

345
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,200
while dancing you can't think, thank God!

346
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,080
But as soon as the whole thing is over you sit down,

347
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,800
again the mind starts going on "tack, tack, tack, tack"

348
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,400
and then we start thinking.

349
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,120
And once we start thinking,

350
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,080
then we are losing that light which we have received.

351
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,000
Sort of, the moon has started waxing.

352
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,040
And that point one has to be careful,

353
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,120
because that's the most important thing.

354
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,400
If you do not allow it to happen first time,

355
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
then it can stop.

356
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,120
It's very simple to understand

357
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,720
that if you can stop

358
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,480
a sari or a last bit of it,

359
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,640
it will not blown off,

360
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,400
because you are holding onto it.

361
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,240
So at the very beginning of waxing of the moon,

362
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,240
if you are careful about it,

363
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,480
if you are alert about it,

364
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,840
it will never happen; whatever you have achieved

365
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,079
will be sustained, and then you can increase.

366
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,920
But that's the very important point which we miss,

367
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,400
and that's why we have lots of trouble

368
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,760
and lots of problems in Sahaja Yoga.

369
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,840
So now as you are moving for your further journey,

370
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,120
so many of you have come for the first time,

371
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,560
I have to tell you:   Don't think!

372
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,280
Don't reflect!

373
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,160
In this you must learn from Indians.

374
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,160
They don't think about these things.

375
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,600
But they have to think, because when they think

376
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,160
they'll start thinking about gross things which they have to think.

377
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,640
I mean you don't think.

378
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
You'll be giving up all that is nonsensical

379
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,600
that you have been thinking about.

380
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,120
So don't think about it,

381
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,160
don't reflect, don't bother!

382
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,240
Try to be subtler and subtler

383
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,960
and not misidentified with your tags

384
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,320
that are outside - like hooks, you see.

385
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,760
And the mind is like a hook.

386
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,640
I have seen all of you have some

387
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,680
one hook outside

388
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,200
and all the yarns go, hook around it,

389
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,240
again another yarn goes and hooks around it.

390
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,840
And the whole mind is attached to that hook,

391
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,520
that is Mr. Ego.

392
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,880
If you can cut your strings somehow or other

393
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,400
and say, "I'm not going to think.

394
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,080
I have come here for my spiritual ascent.

395
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,720
Let me be what I am.

396
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,480
If Mother says something I'll listen to it.

397
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
She scolds me, I'll listen to it, She does something,

398
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,480
whatever She does, let me see

399
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,920
that, as I have come here for chiseling out myself,

400
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,880
let Her chisel me out, let the nature chisel me out,

401
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,960
let the whole atmosphere chisel me out,

402
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,640
Puja should chisel me out."

403
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,360
But you just become like a beautiful,

404
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,000
we can say a

405
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,200
jade in the hands of the Divine,

406
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,720
and allow the Divine

407
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,320
to take out all your beauty.

408
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,680
Just allow the Divine to take out your beauty,

409
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,520
and then you can enjoy your beauty.

410
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,680
But if you hand over to all these old things,

411
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,600
then it will be very difficult.

412
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,160
So as being the first day,

413
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,000
I have started it on the day

414
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,320
when the moon is about to wax, you see.

415
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,079
I hope you'll be all very careful about it.

416
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,000
Be alert!   You have to be very alert.

417
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,560
You have to go beyond time.

418
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
You don't have to think about food.

419
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,520
Once in a while if you don't eat, doesn't matter.

420
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,240
Nobody is going to die.   I tell you!

421
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,920
We don't eat for days together, nothing happens to us.

422
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,480
So food has not come,

423
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,760
the breakfast time, the dinner time -

424
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,000
I mean, there food is a religion, I think,

425
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,520
so everything has a time.

426
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,640
Here there is no time for anything.

427
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,560
We'll do whenever we feel like, you see?

428
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,040
Let's do that way.

429
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,360
So we have to be prepared for a nice thorough cleansing,

430
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,480
and a very enjoyable time throughout.

431
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,960
These two things can work hand in hand,

432
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,360
if you just accept

433
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,760
that you don't have to think.

434
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,600
If you don't think, everything can be done

435
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,200
without any problem, and you'll enjoy life very much.

436
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,040
So that's one thing.
