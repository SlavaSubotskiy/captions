00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,600
(UNCLEAR) as it is, hopefully.

00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,200
Gregore

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,160
Yes Mother.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,080
You better announce (INAUDIBLE)

5
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,520
Yes.The brides come in to to wash the

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,520
boys and everybody who is not a Br

7
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,920
Facing the boys you should stand, the brides should stand facing.

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,840
Each bride, if  she can recognize her future husband

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,600
Place the brides where please no mistake...

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,440
Please move in, move in this side all the brides.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,800
(UNCLEAR) All right? And now, just face them,

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,760
and now you see and

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,000
now say that would you like to marry them.

14
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,320
Everybody should say, "Yes, come along."

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:32,240
Yes, Oui.

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,440
Don't wash. Just rub the earth like

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,960
substance, just rub it off without..

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,400
Rub it in a way that you can collect it.

19
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,280
Rub it in such a way that you can collect it to keep it afterwards.

20
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,240
[UNCLEAR]

21
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,720
Thank you. Beautiful.

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,360
[UNCLEAR] This there is going inside that.

23
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,120
[UNCLEAR]

24
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,200
With great love and affection, with kindness and sweetness.

25
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,200
Sweetness, with a sweetness.

26
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,840
Don't put it out with fingers.

27
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Beautiful.

28
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,520
Actually it is not that in India.

29
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,760
Now anybody who does not want to have marriage after this

30
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
can decide that.

31
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
That's the chance.

32
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,560
Better wipe it nicely.

33
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,120
[UNCLEAR]

34
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,640
[UNCLEAR]

35
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,160
It's alright, brush it off.

36
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,880
Who? [UNCLEAR]

37
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,960
You could have brought the children.

38
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,160
I think we should have two rows, can't just fit there.

39
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Can we have two rows of boys.

40
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,320
Just move on, just move.

41
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Alright. Now when you take your photograph...

42
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,960
What about the boys, have you (UNCLEAR)

43
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,920
[UNCLEAR] should be more flowers.

44
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,920
It is called as"Jaimaal" (garland).

45
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,640
Come here. Hey come along, move few of you here.

46
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,040
Alright now look at your eyes.

47
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,920
Lift her veil, you have to lift her veil.

48
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,520
Now lift her veil not that, that's all right!

49
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,320
You put it back.

50
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,920
[UNCLEAR] this way. No, let it be in the ear, let it be. Yes, good.

51
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,640
Very good. Now this is the [VIDEO INTERRUPTION]

52
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,440
Stand behind there.

53
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,520
[UNCLEAR] You kiss her now.

54
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,000
[UNCLEAR] Good. Now kiss her.

55
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,840
You just stand here, alright.

56
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,280

00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,520
What about the boys? Your bring them now.

58
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,880
[UNCLEAR]

59
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,840
No, its alright, you stand here.

60
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,640
Now put her a garldand.

61
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,960
Great!

62
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,320
[UNCLEAR]

63
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,000
Now those who are married should go at the back.

64
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,840
I mean those who have been garlanded.

65
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,560
I was looking [UNCLEAR]. Garland, garland, go.

66
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,240
So now all of you should walk with your brides there.

67
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,840
You can never do it justice. Never.

68
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,920
It's raining.

69
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,680
It's obviously getting someone video at Mother's feet.

70
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,920
[INDIAN]

71
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,320
[UNCLEAR]

72
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,440
May God bless you!

73
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,000
[UNCLEAR] you go for a new honeymoon now.

74
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,840
[UNCLEAR]

75
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,320
Come on.

76
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,880

77
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,040
May God bless you!

78
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,000
They are really surrendered, both of them.

79
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,120
In a second they accepted.

80
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,280
So well surrendered both of them, in a second.

81
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,560
See now, surrendering is the only way you get your vibrations.

82
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,400
May God bless you!

83
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,280
So I sit down here. You see, I think the girls have to sit in front

84
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,680
first and then the boys.

85
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,720
[UNCLEAR]

86
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,400
I think this you can move now to another end.

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,320
May God bless you!

88
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
Come along.

89
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,960

Put your hands under My feet. Both the hands.

97
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,480
Now through you America should be awakened.

98
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,400
Wait, sit down.

99
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,840
Don't cry!

I hope you have got the ring and keep it in the hand.

280
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,440
First the boy has to put the ring to the hand of the girl.

281
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,720
All of you have, you have?

282
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,040
If you can do after this a big havan [UNCLEAR]

283
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,240
[UNCLEAR]

284
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,680
Water please. Water.

285
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,920
Some four cups of [UNCLEAR] we can do."

286
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,880
No no, silence.

287
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,200
Please sit down all of you. All of you sit down.

288
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,760
The photographer sit down now.

289
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,560
Now during the wedding only one person should take photographs,

290
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,040
not all of you, alright.

291
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,760
Now ladies and gentlemen,

292
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,480
just to start with,

293
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,720
may I with the whole

294
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,920
my devotion in my heart

295
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,400
pay my respect to the Holy Mother.

296
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,600
Whenever I have been here

297
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,520
from Her Holiness I have myself

298
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,760
learned quite a few things.

299
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,680
Today also there is something more addition to my knowledge

300
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,520
and the tremendous work She is doing

301
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,440
I can not describe in words the marvelous job She has been doing.

302
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,560
And it is our good luck and we are all fortunate

303
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,160
to be guided by Her. She has got infinite wisdom

304
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,240
and I just express my heartliest respects to You, Mother.

305
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:55,200
And now this is how we have been able to manage that.

306
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,240
Now this place where, where the wedding is going to take place

307
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,080
is called mandap - the auspicious place.

308
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,080
And we are going to kindle the sacred fire

309
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,680
not ordinarily but as commanded

310
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,720
by the revealed books, that is the Vedas.

311
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,720
Vedas means the books of knowledge

312
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,000
[INAUDIBLE] [HINDI] "is awake"

313
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,440
and they were the revealed books from the Lord

314
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,920
and the sages were inspired by the Lord

315
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,040
and they spoke these [INAUDIBLE] called mantras

316
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,200
collected in the books we can call the Vedas.

317
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,920
Now we need the sacred fire here.

318
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,880
In every scripture of every religion

319
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,880
God has been spoken as a great light -

320
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,320
"jyothi light prakash".

321
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,200
So we need the presence of the holy [INAUDIBLE]

322
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,800
to witness the ceremony and they are going to have certain

323
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,520
pledges and vows at staying together to remain

324
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,800
truthful and honest to each other

325
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,800
in the presence of something which is bright

326
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,400
and there can be no better image

327
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,040
of the Lord among all the material objects of

328
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,360
the world except this bright light.

329
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,240
And for remove the darkness

330
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,640
may the light of God, the light of knowledge and wisdom

331
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,160
remove the darkness of our mind.

332
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,960
Whatever is going to take place outward

333
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,200
it has got something to just explain.

334
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,120
Hidden behind all that outward show is all symbolic.

335
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,040
Outside we have the symbols and behind the symbols there is

336
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,360
something hidden and that is the real ideology,

337
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,960
the real philosophy. And we shall be putting glasses

338
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,480
filled with water here. Water is, water signifies purity,

339
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,360
it's the symbol of purification that purifies everything

340
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,640
and it is also symbol of peacefulness.

341
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,360
When we put water in all the four directions

342
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,200
we always aim at the universal peace.

343
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,800
May there be peace all over the universe,

344
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,880
in all the directions. That is why we put water there.

345
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,920
And flowers are there. Flowers they symbolize

346
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,040
the freshness and newness of life.

347
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,760
You are going to enter a new life of [UNCLEAR],

348
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,080
so flowers are very very befitting on this

349
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,120
auspicious occasion. And also at the same time,

350
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:21,000
just as the sweet fragrance of the flowers spreads around,

351
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,920
pleases everybody, may the good men

352
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,760
of your families from were you come and

353
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,400
your larger family is now the family of the Holy Mother,

354
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,080
that spread like a sweet fragrance of the

355
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,280
flowers around the universe

356
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,640
and bring peace and wisdom reigning everywhere.

357
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,000
This is why flowers are there and they are also beautiful.

358
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,000
Now we have this ghee - clarified butter

359
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,800
that will keep the fire alive there.

360
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,640
And well of course pieces of wood are there. Then we have this

361
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,920
incense.The idea is just to purify the atmosphere

362
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,480
and where is havan samagiri? Yes.

363
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,160
The gentleman is holding this havan samagiri

364
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,800
and that one there and these are supposed to

365
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,520
consist of fragrant herbs, dried flowers, some spices,

366
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,640
things like that so that when they're burnt in the sacred fire

367
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,600
then they are consumed by it and they purify the atmosphere around.

368
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,200
This is what the idea is there and then we have (have we got water?)

369
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,320
[UNCLEAR]

370
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,560
Now this is the right side what you call,

371
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,720
is the material side of love, to be purified.

372
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,160
And for that fire is, as we always use fire,

373
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,240
as you know deepa (oil lamp) I know that you use it, in the same way

374
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,720
it is going to be purified with this fire and the water

375
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,800
as we use to remove that we that, we use water also

376
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,960
and the flowers. They represent the fragrance of the

377
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,840
Flowers are the highest in the matter.

378
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,840
In the same way you are the highest of those who are realized souls.

379
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,800
So what he is saying that this is to be purified and the matter

380
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,400
should be purified because married life

381
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,040
is the epitome of materialism.

382
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,880
If you cannot have a good married life all your materials

383
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,920
have no meaning at all, is zero.

384
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,400
And that's why your material side should to be purified,

385
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,800
sanctified, should be auspicious.

386
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,520
And that's why these are trying to purify the elements,

387
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,000
elements which have created our chakras, as you know that.

388
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,120
So elements must be purified and they have to be worshiped

389
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:39,440
and to be in such a way that all the deities

390
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:46,440
which are of these elements can be also awakened.

391
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,480
Alright? So this is the purification of the elements,

392
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,480
within us and without. Both.

393
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,480
(INAUDIBLE)

394
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,320
Vedas did that.

395
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,880
How it is related to Sahaja Yoga you can see clearly.

396
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:19,480
Now, Holy Mother (CONTINUES IN HINDI?)

397
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,960
So give them guidance, guidance from the source of our intelligence,

398
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,960
source of all life and existence, the Supreme Lord,

399
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,600
and the Supreme Mother, you can say that,

400
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:39,440
so we pray as is contained in the Vedas, in the Holy Vedas.

[HINDI]

432
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,400
Now this is going to be a very important beginning

433
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,600
with madhupark, madhupark is there, mixture of yoghurt and honey.

434
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,560
Honey is very pureful, very energizing

435
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,000
and when it is mixed with yoghurt it becomes a bit mild and cool.

436
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,360
And the idea is that the brides here

437
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:12,000
they will offer their own companions this madhupark,

438
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,600
something sweet expressing the sweet feeling of your heart.

439
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,800
This is called madhupark.

440
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,440
And where is that madhupark, please madhupark.

441
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,560
It's all symbolic, as he said, is all symbolic.

442
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,680
You should go around there to have start.

443
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,920
But this is a circle you can start from anywhere.

444
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,080
Circle has no beginning no end.

445
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:40,320
So the brides, the bride, every bride in here, take a spoon.

446
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,320
You'll pass the spoon from one couple to the other.

447
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,000
Hold the spoons, please. No, the bride will hold.

448
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,560
And you say after that you pass

449
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,680
[UNCLEAR]. First of all you will speak after me.

450
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,360
I will guide you speak. Every bride. All brides, not bridegrooms.

451
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,440
You wills say, "Om,

452
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,360
madhuparko

453
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,920
(MOTHER SPEAKS IN HINDI?)

454
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,600
All the brides should take it from the spoon. Come along.

455
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,160
In the right.

456
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,240

457
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:11,840
They don't have all.

458
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,280
Everybody has a spoon?

459
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,480
No, they don't.

460
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,160
We need more spoons.

461
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,760
Sixteen I think. And we can spare one there.

462
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,480
Sixteen we got. [HINDI]

463

[UNCLEAR]

464
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,480
All of you take.

465
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,480
Only keep like that, only on the hands, holding on the hands.

466
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Now.

467
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,240
All you are going to say

468
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,840
Now all the girls have to say this. And you speak please after this.

469
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,080
Om,

470
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,320
madhuparko,

471
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,160
madhuparko,

472
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,120
madhuparkah,

473
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,800
prati-

474
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,560
grihyataam.

475
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,880
You are saying to your companions,

476
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,080
"Please accept this madhupark

477
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,360
prepared from yoghurt and honey

478
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,960
expressing my sweet happiness.

479
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,280
Please accept it."

480
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:40,920
See that...

481
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,320
And you give it to your companion

482
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,000
The sense is sweetness of marriage.

483
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,240
and they will taste it. Give them. Alright. Let them taste.

484
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,280
Come along.

485
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,640
You taste.

486
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,160
Because according to Indian marriage

487
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,840
the place where the ceremony is going to be held,

488
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,160
that belongs to the bride. She comes to wed there.

489
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,600
And he is given the good welcome.

490
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,840
So this the welcome you are giving to them because

491
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,440
he's coming to wed you here. But here you have

492
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,000
This is the bride's place.

493
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,200
Bride's place, yes.

494
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,240
At the moment, for the time being it's the bride's place.

495
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,800
Now I read the mantra that goes along with that.

496
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,840
OM! Yanmadhuno madhavyam

497
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,680

Tenaaham madhuno-madhavyen paramen.

499
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,960
Roopena-annaadyen paramo. Madha vyonnaadosani.

500
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,560
Sweet is the [UNCLEAR], sweat is the wind,

501
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,560
our hearts are sweet, let our heavenly Father be sweet to us.

502
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:50,840
So now you can keep it here with you and you can take it out after.

503
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:56,160
Now Mataji, the basis of the marriage ceremony

504
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,360
that is kanyadaan, giving away

505
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:04,760
the hand of the bride's prospective bridegroom.

506
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,600
Of course Mataji will bless that.

507
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,040
And we can get about 16 people to do that.

508
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,000
Now, can 16 people

509
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,720
Who are acting as the persons who are giving the hand of the bride.

510
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,680
Come 16 please.

511
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,600
See every parent is there, 16 parents.

512
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,960
Everyone has got?

513
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,160
No, not all.

514
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,480
Why did you take out your garland?

515
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,200
Give it to [UNCLEAR] now.

516
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,400
Now please,

00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,080
now all these parents, they are going to speak now.

You have said, each one of you:

Please take the hand of my beloved daughter,

537
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,840
born in family with the surname Kashyap,

538
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,240
that's the surname of Mataji.

539
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,240
Kashyap is actually a realized soul, Kashyap.

540
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,920
Yes, he was a very great saint.

541

I give her hand to you, please accept it wholly.

543
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,440
And the bridegrooms are going to say, only the bridegrooms,

544
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,040
Om,

545
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,800
prati,

546
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,400
[HINDI]

547
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,880
Thanks, I accept her.

548
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,800
Your offer has been accepted. You can retire now.

549
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,000
Now we are going to kindle the sacred fire.

550
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,160
Now ladies and gentlemen,

551
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,920
can you please attend, very important things are coming ahead.

552
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,040
Very important things are coming ahead now, listen to me.

553
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:02,720
Now, now let's start from here.

554
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:08,760
You take this water both of you, in your right hand.

555
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,120
Somebody comes and goes around.

556
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,880
Give each of them, both, each of them.

557
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:21,000
This is the brother. This is the brother of all the brides.

558
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,560
Go around and give to each one of them, each one of them water.

559
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:42,880
Balha, give it to them, the ones you [UNCLEAR]

560
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,280
Go round.

561
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,760
Just a bit quicker, we have to do it three times.

562
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:19,200
To make it adjustment Mataji, I have learned the technique from you.

563
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,000
[HINDI]

564
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:27,400
You have to keep it in such a way that you should take it thrice.

565
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,080
Thrice. First time and second time you don't have to [UNCLEAR]

566
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,640
Take it in three gulps, take it. [UNCLEAR]

567
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,560
Not the whole lot but three times.

568
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,200
Now I explain to you the significance of sacred water.

569
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:59,480
As we started this water is purified

570
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:04,200
and it means peacefulness.

571
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,760
Water means peacefulness and it is purifier.

572
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:13,200
Now we are starting the ceremony [UNCLEAR] that concern you both.

573
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,160
Now you are going to sip water three times.

574
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:20,080
It means, "May your hearts be purified toward each other."

575
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:26,000
So that you have regards and also at the same

576
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,720
time your mind should be free from any tension.

577
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,280
They should be peaceful, at peace, when you are

578
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,640
starting the ceremony and you are going to sip water

579
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,600
meaning, "May God in the form of water purify your hearts

580
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,600
and you remain truthful and honest to each other"

581
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,400
when you are going to take the vows after that. Ok?

582
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:53,640
Both you follow every advice that he is giving, this is a vow.

583
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,640
Now you are going to

584
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,880
Live it there.

585
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,240
[HINDI]

586
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,280
One third of it.

587
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,600
One, one third of it.

588
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,920
God is our base, this is the idea.

589
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,120
Second time.

590
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,000
[HINDI]

591
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,360
Second time. God is our cover, we take his shelter.

592
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,200
The third.

593
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,720
[HINDI]

594
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,360
Each one of them, each one of you is saying,

595
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,480
"God, give us prosperity,

596
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:29,960
long life, fame and good health." This is what you are saying.

597
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,040
And Truth, Satya.

598
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,160
And Truth, yes.

599
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,040
And now you are going to have in the

600
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,720
left hand a bit and that will be over.

601
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,200
In the, on the left hand, go around.

602
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:42,720
You are the brother.

603
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,920
Just a bit quicker. Don't give [VIDEO INTERRUPTION]

604
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,840
Now with these two fingers. Astrologically they are

605
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,600
considered to be better, these ones.

606
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,560
Mean the first one, because that is the accusing one,

607
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,040
don't take that, take that,

608
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,160
the middle one, these one. And now you're going to touch

609
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:02,760
as I told you. Not do that, you'll start doing when I tell you.

610
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,240
With water you're going to touch mouth, it means,

611
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,800
"May our speech be purified with water,

612
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,040
so that we do not speak evil words."

613
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,680
And you always speak words of love towards

614
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,480
your companion, ok. That is the idea.

615
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,400
Speech is purified and then you are going to touch nose.

616
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,360
"May you always live in very good environment",

617
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:31,080
where there is no foul smell, and at the same time,

618
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,240
"May you have no breathing trouble at all."

619
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,560
Because a requirement of a person who starts

620
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,560
a domestic life is perfect physical health.

621
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,080
And then you are touching eyes. "May you always see

622
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,920
good sights, no impure sights,

623
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:49,960
not to see evil and your eyesight should be perfect."

624
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,040
Should be pure.

625
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:51,880
with very long life.

626
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,720
And then, "You should not listen to evil words there.

627
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,800
Your hearing should be purified."

628
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,320
At the same time, "May you enjoy the perfect path of hearing."

629
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:06,040
Then you are touching there. "May your arms be strong

630
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,400
for such [UNCLEAR] for the protection of the needy."

631
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,760
And you are touching there

632
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,640
It means, "May your legs also be strong

633
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:17,200
so that you always walk upright and nicely"

634
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,400
with no limping, nothing like that.

635
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:23,000
And then you are throwing water all over the body. It means,

636
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,600
"All the limbs of the body impact at physical health"

637
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,880
as the first requirement

638
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:31,040
for a house holder which you are going to be. Alright.

639
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,160
And all of the chakras we can add.

640
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,800
I'm taking a bit so that

641
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,520
When we touch the chakra and then Nabhi

642
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,240
[UNCLEAR]

643
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,040
Yesterday we didn't thought.

644
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,240
And you do as I do.

645
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,360
These two. This's all symbolic. Behind the symbol as Mataji has said

646
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,280
much lies here. And with these two fingers you can do as I do.

647
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,640

654

Now we are ready for kindling the sacred fires before us.

655
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:28,880
[UNCLEAR]

656
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:38,040
I think who should do now because everybody can't do that.

657
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:46,280
So should I do it on your behalf, with your permission?

658
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,360
Now I am representing all of you kindling the sacred fires.

659
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,040
And now the man with the havan samagri please comes.

660
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,560
Come here and give them in the hand to keep

661
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,520
a bit of stock in the left hand. Then they have to use it.

662
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,520
To everybody. And when I say "swaha

663
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,760
you are going to put it. Not the whole lot, just a little bit.

664
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,640
Keep it in your left hand.

665
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,840
In the meantime I kindle the sacred fire to save time.

686
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,880
I'll do it for you this time.

687
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:58,320
Now ladies and gentlemen, after every hymn

688
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,480
I say "swaha". The meaning of "swaha".

689
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:06,680
"Swa aha - what is well said in the hymn

690
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,720
may God accept that prayer

691
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:14,320
recited by us." This is one meaning. Then "swaha" also means

692
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,680
"welfare of the mankind"

693
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,720
which means in anyway He likes. This is the idea of "swaha"

694
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,320
which you repeat everytime. Welfare of mankind

695
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,880
and self-surrender to the deity and then

696
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:34,880
what is contained in the hymn, may that be accepted by the Lord.

697
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:38,160
This is the meaning of the word "swaha". Then it is, again I say,

698
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:42,800
"idam Na mam". "Idam" means "this, "Na" means not, "mam".

699
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,760
"Nothing is mine in this world, everything belongs to God."

700
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,520
Therefore we say,"Nothing is mine, everything God has given to us

701
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:54,160
belongs ultimately to Him because He is the Creator,

702
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:58,640
therefore He is the Master." Ok, this is the idea there and now

703
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,520
after that I'm going to do that for you, on behalf of you.

725
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,920
It means, "Oh sacred fire, kindle.

726
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:02,040
Oh Lord, remove the darkness of my mind", which is ignorance,

727
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:07,560
"and give us health, long life and truthfulness,

728
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:12,480
honesty, give us wealth, cattle wealth, movable property,

729
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:16,800
immovable property so that we do not misuse that

but use it for good things, good works."

731
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,920
This is the idea in hand. Than after that

732
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,840
I will do it for you, we have to do a bit more.

01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,760
[HINDI]

741
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,560
[HINDI]

742
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,480
Now these are the names of God,

743
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:05,360
different names of God. God is One, Reality is One,

744
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:08,440
but the Reality is spoken by many names.

745
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,840
[HINDI]

746
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:17,040
"Truth is One, Reality is One but it is covered by the wise men

747
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:20,720
by different names." Ok? Sometimes we called it "shakti",

748
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,360
sometimes you call it "jagadamba", sometimes you call it

749
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,640
"the merciful lord", "the blissful lord",

750
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:31,480
the "all knowing lord". These are the different names of God.

751
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,720
He is the same God. Sometimes he's called "prajapati",

752
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,680
"the sustainer of the universe", "creator of the universe",

753
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,440
he is called "Agni"- the great light,

754
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,760
he is called "swar" - the great word that

755
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:48,040
inspired the sages and we have got these Vedas and shruti.

756
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:52,480
And sometimes he is called this "prana"- the vital breath

757
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,480
which is so nearest to us, on which our lifes depends. He is

758
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,360
so nearest to us, really the source of our lifes.

759
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,040
All these are names of One Supreme Reality.

760
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,040
Now after that, Mataji, may I have some mithai sweetnies?

761
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,240
[INDIAN]

762
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:14,160
Now this is another symbolic gesture,

763
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:18,160
something sweet representing the

764
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:22,960
blessings, the sweet blessing [UNCLEAR] that He has given to us.

765
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,280
So then we take a portion of that,

766
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,000
make the offering in the sacred fire

767
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,760
which is representing the Holy Lord at this time,

768
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,480
then the idea is, "Oh Lord,

769
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,480
all these sweet blessings which you have given to me

770
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,560
I offer to you because nothing belongs to me.

771
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,880
You are the Creator, everything belongs to You, nothing is mine."

772
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:48,240
That is the idea there. So all these you'll have. In the right hand.

773
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,320
Pass it on [UNCLEAR].

774
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,520
Pass it on, yes.

775
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,560
[UNCLEAR]

776
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:56,280
Take a bit of this. The other one helps.

777
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,120
[UNCLEAR]

778
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:08,440
[UNCLEAR]

779
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,040
holding in your right hand the sweet. [UNCLEAR]

780
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:17,400
and when I say "swaha" you [UNCLEAR].

781
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,880
So I read the mantra. And all those who have

782
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,080
having that please throw it in there.

783
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,680

784
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:34,520

789
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,280
There is also [UNCLEAR]

790
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,640
"If we have missed some part of the ceremony,

791
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,520
if we have not been able to perform the ceremony perfectly well,

792
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:01,440
may God accept it our hearts love

793
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,880
and ignore our drawbacks or faults." Ok?

794
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:09,120
Now the next thing that starts

795
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,240
you are going to put this, little bit out of that,

796
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,000
little bit of. Well, I will do with you.

808

[HINDI]

809
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,200
[HINDI]

810
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,480
[HINDI]

811
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:23,160
[HINDI]

812
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,560

813
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,560
[HINDI]

814
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:36,360
[HINDI]

815
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,080
Now "Gayatri mantra",

816
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:43,560
the great hymn, he is also called as "Guru mantra"

817
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,680
because at the time when the

818
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,760
disciples went to the guru for education,

819
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,720
spiritual education or any such like education,

820
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,000
he is taught by the guru, the guide,

821
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,840
this mantra. This is called "Guru Mantra"

822
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,800
This is also called as "Gayatri Mantra",

823
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,560
"gayatri" means the mantra that protects us.

824
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,520
"Gayatri" also means poetical meter

825
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,960
in this mantra has [UNCLEAR].

826
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,480
And it is also called as "Veda Mata" -

827
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:18,600
"the mother of the Vedas", it's the most important of that.

828
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,280
And that protects us like Our Mother

829
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,520
if we chant it with devotion. It's also called

830
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:28,640
as "Surya mantra", "Savita mantr" and "Savitri mantra"

831
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:32,680
[UNCLEAR] power of the Lord. It is a very holy mantra

832
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:37,040
and the meaning is, "Om", the meaning of "om" is "our saviour,

833
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:40,880
our protector" and it is the most sacred name of God.

834
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,360
[HINDI]

835
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:46,440
"God is all existence, all pervaiding,

836
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:51,720
all knowing" and "swaha" - "of blissful nature."

837
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,280
[HINDI]

838
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:59,760
"And may we meditate on His bright glory and may we always remember

839
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,440
[UNCLEAR] - the power of the Lord

840
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,560
that burns our sins."

841
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,280
[HINDI]

842
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:13,360
"May our mind and intellect be always inspired with a noble cause."

843
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,960
This is the mantra, gayatri mantra, so we chant it three times.

844
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:20,280
[HINDI]

845
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,040

[UNCLEAR] don't put anymore please.

859
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:57,720
Now, more than half of the ceremony has been done

860
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:01,840
and the real ceremony, the wedding ceremony that should start now.

861

01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,440
This has been the custom everywhere.

868
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,600
So you ask after the marriage you will be

870

Mother, I will be [UNCLEAR].

871
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:14,240

you have to give assurance to her [UNCLEAR]

You are giving assurance to her,

"Look, you are going with me as my wife,

[HINDI]

902
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,840
You are saying, each one is saying to each

903
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,920
your own respective or appropriate friend

904
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:27,880
you say, "I hold your hand before the sacred fire,

905
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:33,240
before this august assembly I assure you, you shall be

906
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,400
respected in our family and you shall

907
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,360
be treated as a goddess of [UNCLEAR]".

908
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:43,040
And you also repeat, you say, "The most high

909
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:46,960
and most merciful God has given you to me

910
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:50,480
in the presence of this sacred fire, in the presence

911
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,680
of the Holy Mother , in the presence of whole assembly."

912
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:58,040
Again you repeat [UNCLEAR] again bridegrooms should do.

913
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:01,840

914
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:05,560

[HINDI]

920
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:25,280
Each of you is saying to the appropriate lady here, you say,

921
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:30,400
"I repeat I hold your hand. You are very auspicious.

922
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,080
You are my dear wife and I am your husband

923
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,520
and I shall love you with all my mind, with all my heart."

924
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:41,320
This is what you have said, you have given her the assurance.

925
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,600
Now they will stand and they will

926
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,960
join you. You've saying the pledges.

927
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,720
[UNCLEAR] [VIDEO INTERRUPTION]

928
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,720
Ok? Now,

929
01:23:53,160 --> 01:24:00,040
both of you, and the first of all, this is on behalf of the

930
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:03,640
bridegrooms again. You will speak after me and you are,

931
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:09,640
and you are addressing her. Please after bridegroom you say.

932
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,600
[HINDI]

933
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:17,080
[HINDI]

934
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:22,160
[HINDI]

935
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,200
[HINDI]

936
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,240
[HINDI]

937
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,240
[HINDI]

938
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,720
[HINDI]

939
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:40,040
You are telling them, "Please be firm willed and strong minded

940
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:44,440
like this solid piece of rock so that nobody

941
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:48,720
succeeds in sawing the seed of enmity

942
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:52,760
and jealousy between us." You have addressed your brides like that.

943
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,480
And now here I'd like to explain a bit.

944
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:02,400
Now you have used the word in this mantra as the "stone".

945
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:06,640
Now there are three kinds of significance regarding the stone.

946
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:13,440
Stone represents solid thing, something very strong.

947
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:18,960
Your marriage ceremony is on the foundation of strong stone.

948
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:22,920
And it is unshakeable. This is one idea. The other idea is

949
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,720
stone also represents the obstacles in life

950
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,480
and you say, "Put your foot on the stone,

951
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:34,880
never get defeated, overcome the obstacles of life."

952
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,400
There are many times difficult times in life,

953
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,800
you have to overcome that, not get defeated, understand?

954
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,600
The third idea is become strong as I have told you already

955
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:49,280
so that nobody succeeds in sawing the seed of enmity between you.

956
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:53,520
Now here the next time all of you...

957
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:57,160
Mataji, now they'll be ready to go round.

958
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,320
Remove that. Now,

959
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:06,200
every bride here is saying this prayer

960
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:10,320
and these are the beautiful prayers everyone of you is saying.

961
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,200
The first says,

962
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,880
[HINDI]

963
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:19,400
[HINDI]

964
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,720
[HINDI]

965
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:25,800
The first prayer is the wife says, "May I continue

966
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,240
to receive the love of my husband."

967
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,880
You need to come around there.

968
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:36,720
She says, every wife says, "May I continue

969
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:39,120
to receive the love of my husband." Second

970
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:42,720
[HINDI]

971
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:46,120
[HINDI]

972
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:50,360
Second prayer is, "May my husband and myself enjoy

973
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,720
long life and good health." Third,

974
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,720
[HINDI]

975
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,360
[HINDI]

976
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:04,240
The third is, "May the family of my peers", each one of you say,

977
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:08,120
"we have good relations with each other. May we be blessed with

978
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:12,960
prosperity and God always guides us

979
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:16,200
on the right path." These are the third prayer, ok.

980
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:20,040
And you are going to [UNCLEAR]

981
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,680
you are going to go around the sacred fire.

982
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,080
Please don't go this way, this is the right way.

983
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:29,680
And the first round, "May God give us the knowledge of Dharma

984
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,200
and keep us righteous minded."

985
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,000
And the second one is, "[HINDI] May God give you

986
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,440
economic prosperity", second round.

987
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:42,560
Third round means "[HINDI] happiness, domestic happiness

988
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:45,160
with your companions. And the fourth is

989
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,920
"moksha" - God realization.

990
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:51,080
These are the things everybody needs to have in the lifetime

991
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,240
because the wife gives these preachings to the husband.

992
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:57,360
Therefore wife will lead in the first round

993
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:00,280
the respective husband, she will be ahead

994
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:03,920
and husband would be following her.

995
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:06,760
And then when I... Don't start yet please.

996
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,640
So the first round starts and when the first round

997
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:14,320
finishes you come and stay in the same position you are now.

998
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,920
Look, the same position you are now here, ok.

999
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,680
The first round start, "May God give you right".

1000
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:22,880
As I was telling you, it is with the cooperation of the wife

1001
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:26,480
that the man gets dharma, he remains righteous minded

1002
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,640
if she cooperates nicely at home.

1003
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:33,840
Secondly "[HINDI]". If there is peace at home the husband is able

1004
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:36,840
to earn money or the wife can also earn money

1005
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:41,040
wherever they go for work if the peace is kept at home

1006
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,520
because she is the lady of the house,

1007
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,760
therefore it is on account of her cooperation

1008
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,720
that there is economic prosperity in the family.

1009
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,000
Therefore she will lead in the second round also.

1010
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,120
The third "[HINDI]". If the wife cooperates

1011
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:58,440
there is happiness in the family, much depends on her.

1012
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:01,680
She is the very important person in the household life

1013
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:04,960
and therefore she also lead in the third round.

1014
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,760
And in the fourth the husband will lead.

1015
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,640
He gets realization only if the wife

1016
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,480
cooperates in these three ways. And then

1017
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:17,200
he also leads because wherever he goes

1018
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,680
he will take his wife with him. He will not

1019
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,520
go alone on holidays, he will take her

1020
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:25,120
with him. She is not only the wife

1021
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:28,840
but she is also the most intimate and trustworthy friend.

1022
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,840
Therefore he will take her wherever he goes.

1023
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:34,480
Now the first round will start this way

1024
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:37,640
and I keep off that side. Please keep off the fire.

1025
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:42,360
Wherever you are you have to come back
there and stay in the same position.

1026
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,840
[HINDI]

1027
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:46,560
Walk please.

1028
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:47,880
[HINDI]

1029
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,280
Walk walk, everbody walks

1030
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:52,480
so that everybody's able to walk.

1031
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,120
[HINDI]

1032
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:55,920
[HINDI]

1033
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:57,880
Go around please, full circle,

01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,240
full circle, keep moving, keep moving.

1035
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:03,000
You know when you are standing, you have to come back here.

1036
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:07,200
[HINDI]

1037
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:08,200
Go on.

1038
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,440
[HINDI]

1039
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,640
[HINDI]

1040
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,600
[HINDI]

1041
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:16,720
Keep moving.

1042
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:20,760
May God gives you the knowledge of dharma.

1043
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,960
May you remain righteous minded.

1044
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:27,880
Alright, you've, I'll presume you have taken one circle, allright.

1045
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:30,240
Now second, second. [VIDEO INTERRUPTION]

1046
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,680

[HINDI]

1056
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:06,800
Keep going.

1057
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,600

1058
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,720

1059
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,080

1061
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:20,680
I take it for granted you have done the second round.

[HINDI]

1068
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:47,760
[HINDI]

1069
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,600
Third round, "May God give you happiness, domestic happiness."

1070
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,800
Move on please.

1071
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,400
[HINDI]

1072
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,760
[HINDI]

1073
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,960
[HINDI]

1074
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:00,800
[HINDI]

1075
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,040
[HINDI]

1076
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,920
[HINDI]

1077
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,680
[HINDI]

1078
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:09,840
[HINDI]

1079
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,640
Third round has been taken.

1080
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:18,520
And now the last round. Now the husband now will be leading.

1081
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:25,960
So the husband please, husband, come before your companion.

1082
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:32,880
The husband should come, husband should come before.

1083
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,680
Now the last round.

1084
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:35,520
This is collectivity.

1085
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:41,280
And this is, "May God give you God realization"

1086
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:44,400
with the cooperation of your wife of course

1087
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,520
and so (slowly) and wherever the husband goes

1088
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:52,440
he takes the wife with him. He hides no secrets from her

1089
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:58,160
because she is most trustably worthly, a sacred companion

1090
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:02,800
and very intimate friend and you have to just take her

1091
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,080
into everyone's hands and you to trust each other.

1092
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:09,720
This is the fourth round. Responsibility on the

1093
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:12,240
shoulders of the husband is very very great here.

1094
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:17,120
Realize that and move on while husband moves on this round.

1095
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:22,640
[HINDI]

1096
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:26,400
[HINDI]

1097
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:29,600
[HINDI]

1098
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:34,080
[HINDI]

1099
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:37,680
[HINDI]

1100
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:41,440
Now the very important part of the ceremony is coming

1101
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,400
and after that most of the ceremony would be over.

1102
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:47,560
[UNCLEAR] two minutes after, nothing more.

1103
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,160
Now the most important which is Mataji also spoke that word there,

1104
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:52,640
that is "saptapadi".

1105
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:56,560
You're going to walk seven steps together with your companions there

1106
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:03,080
Now when you walk harmoniously before people outside

1107
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,400
it is very impressive. You walk in harmony,

1108
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,600
in peace, in a friendly way

1109
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:13,400
that gives you the lesson here, an instruction here

1110
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:18,160
that in your domestic life also you have to act harmoniously.

1111
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:23,200
Just as outside walking harmoniously is

1112
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:27,160
impressive, in domestic life work in harmony,

1113
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:30,680
learn the lesson adjustment and accomodation.

1114
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,320
You are not going to force your will, none of you, on each other,

1115
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:38,560
but adjusting each other, accomodating each other,

1116
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:43,560
not forcing your will but adjusting in a cooperative way,

1117
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:48,840
that is life, if life is such harmoniously just taken

1118
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:51,040
in the family, in the household

1119
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,480
that is just like life in the paradise.

1120
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:57,640
Otherwise that becomes the reverse of that which, God forbids,

1121
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:01,000
never comes in anybody's life. So you please

1122
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,760
are going to walk 7 steps together.

1123
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:08,120
But how to, now how to [UNCLEAR] ok.

1124
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:14,080
The first step, and listen to the significance of the first step,

1125
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:17,480
and take the first step, stop it and wait for the second step now.

1126
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:19,720
And with your companions, hold her hand

1127
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:21,640
together, hold her hand together now

1128
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:25,680
so that you know who is your wife, hold her hand.

1129
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:28,800
So you are walking with them together

1130
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,080
in harmony the first step and wait to

1131
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,400
to understand the meaning of that.

1132
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:40,000
[HINDI]

1133
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:44,840
[HINDI]

1134
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:48,280
Take the first step please, first step, stop here.

1135
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,720
The first step meant,

1136
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:56,800
"We take the first step towards unadulterated food, pure food."

1137
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,320
Because on the supply of pure food

1138
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,320
depends one's health and it is very important.

1139
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,360
And so the second now, take the second.

1140
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,560
[HINDI]

1141
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:10,840
Second step towards strength. "May you be powerful and strong."

1142
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,080
And third please.

1143
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:15,800
[HINDI]

1144
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,080
Take the third step towards wealth and prosperity.

1145
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:24,880
Wait for the fourth please.

1146
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:37,360
Yes, now fourth.

1147
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,680
[HINDI]

1148
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:42,200
Take the fourth step towards happiness.

1149
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,400
Take the fourth step towards happiness, move on.

1150
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,560
Now, waith for the fifth. Fifth.

1151
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:51,120
[HINDI]

1152
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:55,000
Take the fifth step towards children. "May God bless you

1153
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,800
with children with nobility of mind and long life

1154
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,760
so that the continuity of the family

1155
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:03,240
goes on and on." So take the fifth step.

1156
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,320
Have you taken the fifth step please?

1157
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:08,480
And now wait for the sixth one.

1158
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:11,080
[HINDI]

1159
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:14,320
Take the sixth step towards self-respect. You have to be

1160
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:17,000
with self-esteem many times in your family life,

1161
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,920
and also best health throughout the season.

1162
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:23,120
You have taken the sixth step. Now the last step please,

1163
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:25,920
and then what will happen in last step please,

1164
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:30,640
please listen. In the last step

1165
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,240
now when we started the ceremony you remember

1166
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:38,760
the wife was to the right of the husband.

1167
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,000
Now she is going to be to the left of the

1168
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:44,800
husband. You're going to change after seventh step has been taken.

1169
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,280
Now seventh step is coming, very important.

1170
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:49,720
[HINDI]

1171
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:54,240
Take the seventh step towards stable companionship.

1172
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:57,800
"May your marriage be stable, unbreakable."

1173
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,240
Seventh you've taken. Now the husband

1174
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:03,360
to go to the right of the wife, wife to come

1175
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:06,200
to the lef of the husband. Change the position.

1176
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:16,920
We can now, sit now. You can sit now. Please take your seat now.

1177
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:22,320
Still more enjoyable.

1178
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:30,480
Now after that I tell you

1179
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:37,320
why the wife after the marriage remains to the left of the husband.

1180
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:43,640
Not that she is inferior in any way or she is a junior partner, no.

1181
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:49,840
Now every wife now will know she is near the heart of her husband.

1182
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:52,360
That is the idea there. After the

1183
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,800
marriage in the heart of the husband

1184
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,400
there should be only the "pratima" or "murti" of the wife

1185
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,120
who is the trustworthy friend and she

1186
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,240
is near that, she has occupied her

1187
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,640
appropriate place which is the place of wife

1188
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,680
to remain to the left to the husband near to the heart.

1189
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,480
And that is now according to

1190
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:16,000
our Dharma Shastra the ceremony is valid now

1191
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,760
when you have walked the seven steps together.

1192
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:22,440
Now after that I am going to put the auspicious mark

1193
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:25,760
on their forehead.

1194
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:37,680
[HINDI]

1195
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,600
Give them sweet, give them some.

1196
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,760
Yes yes. What are you holding there, see.

1197
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:43,920
Is that? Yes, thank you very much.

1198
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:47,080
Now, alright I start from here.

1199
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:50,720
Circle we have that wanting in a circle you can start from anywhere.

1200
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:51,920
Yes please.

1201
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:56,520
So I start from the right. Where is the husband now?

1202
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:59,760
[HINDI]

1203
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:01,160
You put it on her

1204
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:08,920
and take, draw the line, take it above. Take more color.

1205
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,960
Yes please [UNCLEAR].

[HINDI]

1207
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:30,760
And also the line there, deep line.

1208
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,200
On the Sahasrara.

1209
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:35,440
She is now, everyone of you, is now putting the

1210
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:37,920
red color on the line on the head.

1211
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:41,960
You are saturating the companion with your love.

1212
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:44,560
So this is the color of affectionate love.

1213
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:47,040
[MOTHER SPEAKS IN HINDI]

1214
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,920
Yes, here [UNCLEAR] now listen to Mataji to what She say.

1215
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:54,640
That is the realization, that is why we put the color.

1216
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:32,200
Pass it over, little little to everybody,

1217
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,760

all of you. May God bless you!

1220
01:41:44,160 --> 01:41:48,040
Half of this then take half after. Take it out.

1221
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:55,040
A little little, take, all of you should have.

In such a way that she doesn't go on.

And look at the photograph, [?RAUL]

1238
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,840
Now you are feeling in the way you are looking after each other.

1239
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:21,200
It's from the other side also.

1240
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:24,240
Again please, expressing the free feelings of your heart,

1241
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:28,160
looking after each other. May you always look after each other well

1242
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,360
We can finish with that.

1243
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,640
[UNCLEAR] here also.

1244
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:53,280
Tiny little birds that feeding each other.  Very nice [UNCLEAR]

1245
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:10,080
Now you hold your mangal sutra after finish feeding each other.

1246
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:14,560
Take mangal sutra. Now you are putting the mangal sutra.

1247
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:18,840
Where is your mangal sutra? You don't have?

1248
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:20,520
Mataji, mangal sutra?

1249
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:21,720
He doesn't have.

1250
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:24,320
He doesn't have.

1251
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:25,680
Who doesn't have?

1252
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:27,080
We're quite a lot.

1253
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:33,360
In the back [UNCLEAR], no?

1254
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:37,520
I think they were taken out of the boxes, Mother.

1255
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:38,880
They were taken out.

1256
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:42,960
How many do you need?

1257
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:55,400
One, two, three, four, five. Five only, Mother.

1258
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:58,000
Very good, very good idea.

1259
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:02,760
So you, now don't you laugh, you just take the garland

1260
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,760
and take that mangal sutra, ok. Don't take it out, just touch it.

1261
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,720
[UNCLEAR] let them have a look.

1262
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:10,080
Just wait.

1263
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:15,920

[HINDI]

1267
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:32,280
Now all those others who're watching the marriage ceremony here they

1268
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:34,000
will speak after me, also we can go.

1269
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:35,920
[HINDI]

1270
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:38,840
[HINDI]

1271
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:40,880
[HINDI]

1272
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:42,920
[HINDI]

1273
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:45,440
We have said, "May you be happy,

1274
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:48,240
may good fortune be with you." We have blessed them.

1275
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:50,160
Now flowers, I want flowers now.

1276
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:52,240
When [UNCLEAR] ceremony we need flowers,

1277
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:55,720
give us flowers there.

1278
01:46:56,360 --> 01:47:00,320
Somebody to take the job of taking down this basket of flowers.

1279
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:09,800
What shall we do with the rice?

1280
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,760
Ah well, hold it, just hold it.

1281
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:17,000
No, yes, you hold it in your hands, throw on them.

1282
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,960
Make a bigger cirlce please, bigger circle.

1283
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:32,560
Make a bigger circle.

1284
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:37,000
Now, where is your...? Yes, he's there.

1285
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:18,560
Now let me bless them saying the holy mantra

1286
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:22,360
and after that when I say only then you will

1287
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:26,040
throw on them please. Now first of all let me tell on.

1288
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:30,680
[HINDI]

1289
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:33,840
[HINDI]

1290
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:38,040
[HINDI]

1291
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:40,560
[HINDI]

1292
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:43,160
[HINDI]

1293
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:45,800
[HINDI]

1294
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,440
[HINDI]

1295
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:51,520
[HINDI]

1296
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,600
[HINDI]

1297
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:56,920
[HINDI]

1298
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:59,920
[HINDI]

1299
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:02,120
Now the idea of that mantra is

1300
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:07,400
that "May you see 100 autumn seasons,

1301
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:11,080
100 spring seasons, 100 summer seasons.

1302
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:14,240
You enjoy long life but at the same time with

1303
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:19,040
very good health so that all the life time

1304
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:22,360
are active and do your duties,

1305
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:25,720
family duties and outside duties.

1306
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:29,440
And may you show respect to your elders

1307
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:32,640
and show kindness, love to your youngers.

1308
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:36,160
And may you always speak to each other

1309
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:40,000
with words of love and always look after each other well,

1310
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:43,360
and remain true and faithful

1311
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:47,480
companion and friends to each other, always trustworthy."

1312
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:51,080
That was the blessing. Now you are going to

1313
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:54,680
Don't please throw them in one lot but three times.

1314
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:59,640
Put two portions in left hand and one portion in the right hand.

1315
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,200
Wow, stop stop.

1316
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,520
I have to say the mantra.

1317
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:17,760
You are very impatient, they are also impatient.

1318
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,120
And say please [UNCLEAR]:

1319
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:26,280
[HINDI]

1320
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:29,760
[HINDI]

1321
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:33,040

1322
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,280
[UNCLEAR] ceremony yet.

1323
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:15,640
Now [UNCLEAR] by the grace of the Lord

1324
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,760
the ceremony has been happily concluded.

1325
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:19,400
So this is what we are going to do.

1326
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:23,880
[HINDI]

1327
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:28,440

[HINDI]

1329
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:36,080
Everything created by the Lord is complete and perfect it is always.

1330
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:40,200
Now the hymn of peace is the last hymn, peace for mankind.

1331
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:45,520

[HINDI]

1339
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:10,080
"May there be peace in heavenly region.

1340
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:13,280
May there be peace in mid regions.

1341
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:17,560
May there be peace on earth. May the water flow peacefully.

May Brahma, the Supreme Lord, be in peace.

1344
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:27,840
May all the vishwadevas, divine powers, be in peace.

1345
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:30,680
And may that peace come onto me.

1346
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:34,440
And may the peace itself is beneficial to mankind

1347
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:37,240
and may that peace to everybody."

1348
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:40,240
Om shantihi, shantihi, shanti.

1349
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:42,840
That terminates, Mataji, concluded.

01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:44,920

02:03:51,640 --> 02:03:56,040
[UNCLEAR] what you have to do. You should not be stubborn

1490
02:03:56,600 --> 02:04:01,080
[UNCLEAR]

1491
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,080
And not feel bitter at any point. Just try to be sweet.

1492
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:10,200
In the beginning especially when you...

1493
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:14,000
And don't go on demanding.

1494
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:17,400
Sometimes we feel we have a wife or a husband who

1495
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:23,960
it's a office of demand, it's not giving. Alright?

1496
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:27,480
Must learn to give and give and give,

1497
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:30,320
all the time. Enjoy the giving part.

1498
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:35,560
Now where is the knife? Can we get the knife?

1499
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:36,960
There is one coming, Mother.

1500
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Alright.

1501
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:53,640
Sixteen is a very auspicious number, you know. Sixteen plexuses.

1502
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:56,560
Is for the Virata, for the collective.

1503
02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:00,560
Now I hope collectively all of you who are married today

1504
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:03,360
will try to make your married life extremely

1505
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:06,320
successful and an example for others.

1506
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:14,960
Try to be sweet, nice to each other. Be kind.

1507
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:22,040
Actually you should enjoy. That's the thing you don't know.

1508
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:24,120
Must learn to enjoy.

1509
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:28,560
Everybody is looking so beautiful.

1510
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:30,480
Only thing you must learn to enjoy.

1511
02:05:30,680 --> 02:05:32,840
And put your ego on one side first of all.

1512
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:39,640
All the egos are the things that stop your enjoyment, absolutely.

1513
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:43,920
It's the ego that stops your enjoyment. Finish it off.

1514
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:45,880
Tell him not to come in between

1515
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:48,360
because he will just spoil everything.

1516
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:51,640
He tells you, "Don’t do this otherwise

1517
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,960
you see she should take advantage of you."

1518
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:58,600
Or she, if she is sitting "she'll take advantage."

1519
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:00,600
No reservations in marriage between

1520
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:02,520
husband and wife, no secrets, nothing.

1521
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:04,400
Just be kind.

1522
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:07,280
And you should not say something that is not to be said.

1523
02:06:07,480 --> 02:06:10,840
For example one of the keys aspects, about your past life.

1524
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:13,840
Never talk. Forget it, it's over now.

1525
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,480
That's something very wrong, talk of the past life

1526
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:20,920
and to be very confessing. There's no need.

1527
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:27,000
Talk of something nice. What you are going to do, what you are going

1528
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:28,800
to achieve and you are going to have.

1529
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:32,600
And enjoy. Not of your past life, it's over, forget it.

1530
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:36,200
Alright? Be kind to each other. Be nice to each other.

1531
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:39,880
Enjoy is the point. Those who enjoy the most their married life

1532
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:44,520
are nearest to my heart. But they should be in Sahaja Yoga.

1533
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:50,040
Those who enjoy married life without Sahaja Yoga are stupid.

1534
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:05,920
Alright, so here I have to cut for the bride [UNCLEAR]

1535
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:09,240
All of you, I'm cutting down here, alright?

1536
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:12,280
May God bless you all. May God bless you all.

1537
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,880
Now somebody (now you can take it there)

1538
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:25,280
Now somebody who is an expert

1539
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:31,000
[UNCLEAR] I don't know

1540
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:34,000
Anybodiy who sings you can do it.

1541
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:39,480
John. David.

1542
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:43,640
Alright, David you can offer [UNCLEAR]

1543
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:58,040
Light all of them. [UNCLEAR]

1544
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:27,600
Now what song you sing for a happy married life?

1545
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:34,000
Happy marriage to you, happy marriage

1546
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:37,440
dear people, happy marriage to you.

1547
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:57,360
to you, happy marriage to you,

1548
02:08:57,640 --> 02:09:01,400
happy marriage dear people,

1549
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:05,840
happy marriage to you.

1550
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:20,000
Blowing out, we're going to have these blown out.

1551
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:26,480
And the blowing now, who is supposed to blow it, Me?

1552
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:27,520
Yes, Mother.
