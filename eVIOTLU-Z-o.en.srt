1
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:23,390
secondly I have to tell you that the

2
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:26,700
women in the West have changed their

3
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:29,160
styles which is very very dangerous for

4
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,890
their society because they have also

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,790
taken to the egoistical ways of men

6
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:39,000
so if men have gone say ten feet

7
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,600
they have run after them again about say

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,309
eight feet and pull back men even to go

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:51,840
further that now this is completely

10
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:55,710
crossing your egos because women do not

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,320
have such possibility fevers normally so

12
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,660
competing men in ego what you did you

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,230
have lost your complete maryadas of a

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,410
woman

15
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,470
there's no Maria de Ojo man has a

16
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:10,409
maryada of a man if a man start leaving

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,760
like a woman he is not a man in the same

18
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,000
way the women if they start behaving

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,880
like men then there are no more women

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,250
there lost her maryadas they are out so

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,830
they get possessed and that's why women

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:28,050
when they are egoistical they become

23
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:30,150
horrid their face has become horrid they

24
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,690
look horrid their whole behavior is

25
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,200
horrid they can become dry like beans

26
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:40,110
Dixie and could be so hard as to hit you

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,410
like an iron rod they say the lady

28
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,600
retire in a rod in Iraq all these

29
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:48,930
happens because we have a Maria

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,560
we are the style as we are if it Sara

31
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,060
Rue's it suppose be happy that you are a

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,730
flower of rose

33
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,730
now the rose wants to become the thought

34
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:09,410
so we lose all our maryadas to that

35
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,870
today I will be speaking to you before

36
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,970
we start this here when the people are

37
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,550
coming before that to the ladies and

38
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,849
tell them what's gone wrong with them

39
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:23,870
and that is how you must know that the

40
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:30,489
plight of the West is not by men but by

41
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:33,530
women women have ruined the Society of

42
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:36,650
Western society is the Indian women who

43
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:39,140
have kept the society intact all my

44
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:44,330
really thanks to their self solid

45
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:47,500
behavior towards life it is the women of

46
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:51,500
this country who have ruined all that

47
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:54,950
was so delicate emotional beautiful love

48
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:59,810
affixed and compassion women are there

49
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:02,810
to give joy and happiness and emotional

50
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:07,519
security to the whole society while they

51
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:08,840
take over do they keep that do that even

52
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,989
the husbands have become just like

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,730
servants in the house you haven't done

54
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:17,600
the cleaning properly you haven't

55
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,350
cleaned the kitchen properly I went to

56
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,420
England I was surprised all kitchen

57
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,040
cleaning and all that is so well done in

58
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,840
England we see you have everything for

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,150
cleaning days cleaning that I said why

60
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,590
it has happened is the men you see they

61
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,840
had to do it so they found out all the

62
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:38,720
ways and methods has to be sparking all

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,120
right [ __ ] you up I'll get you such a

64
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,180
thing that if you put you in your hand

65
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,890
you're having burn all the acid with a

66
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,420
big glove in the hand put it everywhere

67
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:54,530
[Laughter]

68
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:58,250
then the children you see suffer because

69
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:01,280
that's the job of a gardener beautiful

70
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,079
things that are born to be looked after

71
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,760
with that kindness but you overindulge

72
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:09,829
into your children in the beginning a

73
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,190
mother is like a gardener she has to

74
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:12,190
prove

75
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:18,709
chef's to cut also so the growth is all

76
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,670
right if your child is pointy or no good

77
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,670
another useless yeah

78
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,050
but you grow me your husband not your

79
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,070
children justa the Waya because ego is

80
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,800
towards her husband all the time

81
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:37,320
grooming six-year go there what these

82
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,050
money business give me all the money i

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,150
keep all the money everything now one

84
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,170
may say that the law is such if the law

85
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,630
is stupid

86
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:48,390
the sahaja yoginis should not take to

87
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,370
such a level that law has ruined you all

88
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:54,060
I think because this is such an

89
00:04:50,370 --> 00:05:00,960
important part of life it is such an

90
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:06,230
important area of life that it should

91
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:11,100
not have suffered where affection love

92
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:14,040
kindness all that is required is missing

93
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,010
then you become people without any

94
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,150
meaning life is endless you don't know

95
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:24,030
what to do that's why the children

96
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:25,740
commit suicide and then the laughs

97
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,260
should be such that she should be true

98
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,820
for that you must have wisdom which also

99
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,700
one does not develop because if you run

100
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,180
after your mooladhara chakra how can you

101
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,180
have it stuff

102
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:44,180
here men have befooled you completely

103
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:49,230
completely there before take it from me

104
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:50,940
you must keep your wisdom intact and not

105
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:54,050
only that they have be fully but they

106
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,610
themselves have stooped down to the food

107
00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:01,710
so they have their devious methods they

108
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:04,110
are not straightforward so i sahaja

109
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,410
Yogi's we are above all these things we

110
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:09,780
have reached a state where we are above

111
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:11,130
we are here for correcting all those

112
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,230
things that have gone wrong in the

113
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,850
society because sahaja yoga faces

114
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,730
towards a society not towards yourself

115
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,470
only so at this stage we have to

116
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,500
understand what we have to do is first

117
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:26,430
of all our own understanding should be

118
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,710
such even now with all this movement of

119
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,020
sahaja yoga understanding women don't

120
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,979
realize that they have to be like women

121
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,220
I have seen that they still what's wrong

122
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:39,340
still go

123
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:48,850
and men don't understand that they have

124
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:51,340
to be like men even after so and if they

125
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:54,730
become really like men women will

126
00:06:51,340 --> 00:07:00,220
appreciate them and if you become really

127
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:02,800
like women men will appreciate you this

128
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:08,320
is the opposites that attracts each

129
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:10,900
other that should be no but we live in

130
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:16,960
abnormal way that the men are women and

131
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:21,370
women are men what do you do that so it

132
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,930
is very important for men to understand

133
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,380
now because I'm going to talk to women

134
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:29,710
it at all that they should become like

135
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:32,260
men they must fix up things they must

136
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:35,770
take decisions they must be the one who

137
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:39,070
must true but that's outward actually

138
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,830
it's the source is the woman the woman

139
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:44,340
is the potential and man is the kinetic

140
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:48,220
for example there is a fan moving

141
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:50,650
movement of the fan is the kinetic force

142
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:54,250
you can say but the potential force that

143
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:56,440
is within us is the one which is the

144
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,020
electricity which is coming from the

145
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,860
source which is higher the fan that

146
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:06,610
moves or the source let the women decide

147
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:08,560
and Men understand but if that source

148
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:14,140
dries out and wants to become the fan no

149
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:17,500
fan will one upside down situation if

150
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,240
you realize you are the source you are

151
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,300
the one who is going to give all the

152
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,630
Shakti to man will stop behaving like

153
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,520
men it doesn't mean that you cannot go

154
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,880
to work you cannot do but take to work

155
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,620
which is more suitable to women like I

156
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:38,500
would not like a woman to have a bus

157
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:42,880
driver job or a truck driver or wrestler

158
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,880
[Laughter]

159
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:49,290
no I'm not telling empty from experience

160
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,660
once I was Charlie I was a student at

161
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,390
that time in Lahore you see and I'ma

162
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,029
start travelling by train and at some

163
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:05,860
station you see the train stopped in the

164
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:07,959
night and a lady came and she said open

165
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:11,020

166
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:12,730
crowded all right I'll try I try and she

167
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,440
said if you don't open I can break it I

168
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,450
said how can you said you don't know why

169
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,149
I said you I said she said I'm Mohammed

170
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:21,450
Amano sousou-sama da moneh the wrestler

171
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:24,520
lady Obama I said tango

172
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,570
I said if you are a wrestler lady why

174
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:33,940
Department why don't you go to the men's

175
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:36,130
and she pushed the door so violently she

176
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:43,810
came up I looked at her I said wow what

177
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:48,370
a person and she sat down you see with

178
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:51,370

that she said are you not come Alana

182
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,140
those who want to say I should not sit

00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,660
here I said nobody wants that now madam

184
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,370
you seek comfort but we'll have to get

185
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:08,890
somebody from the other compartment to

186
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:11,950
have wrestling I bet she was quieted and

187
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:14,230
she was really I've saw her all her

188
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:17,820
muscles so over developed and she was

189
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:21,120
really looking like I would say a

190
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:25,509
Western cow we can say

191
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:28,699
[Laughter]

192
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:33,350
like the Gaussian look like buffaloes

193
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:35,000
not like cows something very funny I

194
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:39,380
cannot forget that you see that it's

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,930
fear I was very young I really felt like

196
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:49,610
laughing but I laugh I thought she walks

197
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:52,160
by so this is what it is that we are

198
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,050
ending up there must know that how far

199
00:10:52,160 --> 00:11:00,459
are we going are we going to become

200
00:10:54,050 --> 00:11:03,380
wrestlers so this is what it is

201
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:06,230
one has to learn that it has been there

202
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:10,550
for ages ages it has been there I have

203
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:12,949
seen have read books some books old

204
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,380
books I have seen some films also where

205
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:16,880
they have shown even in olden times the

206
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,279
women used to have room in their hand

207
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,470
sitting there husband sort of thing we

208
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,810
do have some of them blessed in India

209
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:29,300
but very very few very few women take

210
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,970
not a big number but it faint rings got

211
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,970
those see so keep your fingers crossed

212
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:37,579
but I would say that this is what is

213
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,040
happening so with too much ego of man

214
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:43,100
which goes into left to GD they say not

215
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,930
let the women take over all right can be

216
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,630
satisfied no more of their aggression

217
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:50,720
let them have their own so they do what

218
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:53,209
they like men are not bothered and they

219
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,149
go into their left this thing there's no

220
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:59,360
enjoyment of marriage or now so now we

221
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:01,760
have yesterday the other marriage for

222
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,829

223
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,760
goodness of them all that take your

224

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,449
women and men and you see you'll enjoy

226
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:16,220
the quarrel should be on that road the

227
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:18,439
man wants to do something worried should

228
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,380
say no no no how can even that's too

229
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:23,630
much for me let me do this work as I

230
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,550
have told you many a times how my

231
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,920
husband when he gets angry he wants to

232
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:30,850
wash his undershirt to see to show his

233
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:39,370
anger or when he is very angry

234
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:45,490
then he will clean the bathroom but he

235
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:47,260
does it so badly that I know that it is

236
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,660
he has done I feel like laughing but I

237
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:53,290
dare not because I must keep his spirit

238
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:56,590
on then and then he starts talking in

239
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:58,690
you know in a very is he a respectable

240
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:01,450
way to everyone now he calls everyone

241
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,910
Tao you see now he says Dao are like

242
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,580
that now are like that so I know now

243
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,560
he's a really angry for something but he

244
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,650
won't say what what she's here angry me

245
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,350
see then we have to find out what is he

246
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:16,830
angry with and if so don't feel guilty

247
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,830
correct

248
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:22,990
now you must find out what are the weak

249
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,500
points of your husband first of all and

250
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,890
of your wife on what points she get

251
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,690
upset

252
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,310
now the attitude should be we should not

253
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,800
upset her we should not make her angry

254
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,980
and another attitude of the wife the

255
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,470
same way much more for the hospital so

256
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,080
now what are the soft points on which

257
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:44,380
she really gets upset just turn it it's

258
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,920
very simple aliphatic don't take it

259
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,500
seriously

260
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:51,250
but be careful to avoid that now also

261
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,320
find out what makes him happy like if I

262
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,270
am really sometimes I never get angry as

263
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,620
you should know that I'm never get angry

264
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:03,850
but if I am showing off my anger just

265
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:06,690
let it be let it be solid see doc you

266
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,690

268
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:18,600
neutralize an anger of a person say now

269
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,100
supposing I am trying to show if you put

270
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,529
a child in my lap finished

271
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,860
anger is gone I cannot show anger with

272
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:29,490
the child on my lap simple so you must

273
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,980

278
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:48,120

in your bubbles of laughter it just

289
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,670
settles down in your mind that's how you

290
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,730
should be because humor is one of the

291
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:20,610
greatest thing that puts the thing

292
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:24,180
through makes the person understand and

293
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:26,550
it doesn't harm anyone that's how things

294
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,680
improve and when you see that you are

295
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,330
