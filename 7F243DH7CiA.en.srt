1
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:33,000
When you are all meditating and inside I also
find it difficult to be outside.

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:44,460
So today you have arranged to have this puja
here.

3
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:54,010
Just before that you have to prepare yourself
physically and mentally.

4
00:00:54,010 --> 00:01:02,690
Physically you must give yourself a bandhan
and a bandhan is nothing but you give yourself

5
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,950
a protection to your aura.

6
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:13,140
How you do it is very simple which I will
tell you just now how to do it and then you

7
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,170
sit down for your puja.

8
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,540
Then mentally you have to put yourself right.

9
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,700
First of all, you should not feel guilty at
all.

10
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,220
If you are guilty you cannot do my puja.

11
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,920
You should be absolutely above that.

12
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,100
There should be no tension in your mind.

13
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,790
You are not guilty, you are in the present.

14
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,280
Like flowers you are looking.

15
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,159
How can flowers be guilty?

16
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,729
First get out of that guilt business.

17
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,100
You should not feel guilty or tense.

18
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,970
Everything that is done is the best.

19
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,650
You shouldn’t worry about it.

20
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,890
It’s not your responsibility even to arrange
it.

21
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,950
Just think that everything is done sahaj.

22
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:11,510
Gradually when you’ll move in Sahaja Yoga
you’ll be surprised to see how things are

23
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,690
arranged just beautifully.

24
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:21,530
When these people were looking for a place
there was no place for less than $250 each.

25
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,920
They said this is too much for everybody’s
pocket.

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,150
Then suddenly, spontaneously they found this
place.

27
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,040
When they said $50 nobody could believe.

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,970
They thought that we’ll just get some porridge
in the morning and the rest of it will be

29
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,970
fasting.

30
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,430
So many were rather worried.

31
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,840
Some thought it was a scout camping ground
or whatever it is and quite worried when it

32
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,090
starts raining.

33
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,751
But this is all God’s grace to get such
a place, such a comfortable place for you.

34
00:02:53,751 --> 00:03:01,190
You come here and everything is arranged by
God’s grace.

35
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:07,372
If something is not arranged just forget it,
just leave it, just don’t worry.

36
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:09,790
That’s the best way.

37
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:17,069
Then what happens is that you become one with
the present and you can overcome all your

38
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:18,880
problems of tension.

39
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,150
Tension mounts up when we want to do that
which you are not supposed to do, with which

40
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,269
we are not successful.

41
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:31,650
There is also a mental barrier between ourselves
and our mind that we want to do a particular

42
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,000
thing in a particular way.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,180
If you can give up that, then you will be
surprised that you become absolutely one with

44
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,400
the Divine and you start working it out in
a very beautiful manner.

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,440
Now see the root of a little seed.

46
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,569
It just sprouts, it goes this way.

47
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:59,689
If it finds there is an obstruction, there
is some sort of a stone or something, it goes

48
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:00,689
around it.

49
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:04,730
Then it finds another obstruction, it goes
away from it.

50
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,690
It doesn’t fight that but just says, “All
right, let me find my own way."

51
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:14,330
Then he uses the same stone for holding the
tree.

52
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:23,320
So clever, he goes around the little stone
and uses that for its own purpose.

53
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,650
This is how a Sahaja Yogi should behave.

54
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,850
Not to take responsibility and put others
into tension: “This must be done."

55
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,680
“This is not here."

56
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,910
“That is not there."

57
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,910
It’s not necessary.

58
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,340
It’s your love that is important.

59
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:44,310
For which you must have heard the story of
an old woman who was living in a forest.

60
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:51,550
Her name was Shavari and she heard that Shri
Ram was going to come in the forest.

61
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,700
She was so elated.

62
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,070
Such an innocent woman, she didn’t know
what to do.

63
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:10,110
When Rama came she gave him a kind of berry,
called a ber, to eat and she told in very

64
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,220
great innocence that everyone of them I have
tested to see that they are not sour.

65
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,729
And he ate them so lovingly.

66
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:23,419
His brother was a hot-tempered fellow.

67
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:24,419
He got very angry.

68
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:25,610
He said, “What is this?

69
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,830
This lady has no sense.

70
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:32,909
She is giving all these things which are eaten
by her, first of all."

71
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:40,010
It’s what we call as uttishtha – it means
that when somebody, even your brother, has

72
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,320
eaten something, you cannot eat that.

73
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,240
It’s regarded as something that is not good,
not auspicious.

74
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,210
“And this lady, an old lady with her few
teeth that are left, she has just pierced

75
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,839
every ber and has given to my brother."

76
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:05,930
Rama’s wife, Sita, was just smiling at the
whole situation and then Rama gave that ber

77
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,570
to his wife and she ate it.

78
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:17,630
She looked at her brother-in-law and said,
“These are the best bers I have ever eaten.

79
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,020
I’ve never had such a taste before.

80
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,090
But I’m not going to give you anything."

81
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:27,700
See, the best way to challenge the ego is
not to say that you are not going to have

82
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,700
it.

83
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
He said, “Why?”

84
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,700
She said, “No, I won’t give you.

85
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
You won’t have them, I will not.

86
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,700
I will eat all of them."

87
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,340
He said, “No, how can you eat all of that?”

88
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:40,320
He snatched some of them and he ate and also
felt the same thing.

89
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,360
Because they are given out of love.

90
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,600
Whatever is done out of love is a thousand-fold
better than that is done out of tension and

91
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
problem.

92
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,020
I should never like to cause any tension in
your mind of any kind.

93
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,240
For small, sm all things you should not worry.

94
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,240
You must give up your tensions absolutely
and understand that you are the children of

95
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
God.

96
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,039
You are to be looked after.

97
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,659
You are to given everything that is available
in His realm.

98
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:11,340
You should not get into tension at all.

99
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,190
Firstly, not to feel guilty, but then to feel
that we had to go to this guru, that guru?

100
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,520
All right, forget it.

101
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Whatever has happened has happened.

102
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
Forget it.

103
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,680
Don’t worry on that point also because that
will tie you down all the time saying, “Why

104
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,060
did you go to that guru?

105
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,640
Why did you pay money to this fellow?”

106
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:38,339
Just tell your mind, “I am not bothered.

107
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:40,000
Whatever my egg has done, now I am a bird.

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,580
I have nothing to do."

109
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,680
Be in the present, that is very important.

110
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:52,060
Have no guilt, have no worries of the past
because if you worry of the past you can never

111
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,590
enjoy the present.

112
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:59,820
You are here to enjoy and not to worry about
the past.

113
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,680
I hope you understand this very well and to
forget whatever has happened and forgive.

114
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,140
There are Sahaja Yogis with you.

115
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,140
Enjoy life.

116
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,950
Always try to see the good points of other
Sahaja Yogis and not the bad points.

117
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:17,170
Normally we try to find out what’s wrong
with another person, especially when we know

118
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,170
about chakras.

119
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,159
We just understand that this person has got
these very bad chakras.

120
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:25,270
Then the only thing what to do is to give
yourself a bandhan, which I will tell you,

121
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,960
and deal with the person.

122
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,399
But when you know that person has this sickness
or this kind of a chakra caught up, no use

123
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,919
arguing, no use telling them.

124
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,770
Let them come up, they’ll come right.

125
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,589
Tell them that this is what it is.

126
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:42,490
At the most you can tell your children, you
can tell your wife.

127
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:50,490
But somebody who is not [UNCLEAR] connected,
you cannot put Sahaja Yoga into their heads.

128
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,279
Sahaja Yoga cannot be forced into anyone whatsoever.

129
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,670
It has to be accepted [UNCLEAR].

130
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,880
It has its own protocol.

131
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,690
It cannot be just poured into your mouth,
that you’d better have it, is a wrong thing.

132
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,940
There are some people who still have lots
of doubts, I know that, who are sitting here.

133
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,120
These should go away.

134
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,500
Because then they feel guilty, “I have doubts."

135
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,180
Please get rid of those doubts if possible
because I do not want that you should feel

136
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,470
later on that, “Oh, Mother, we doubted you."

137
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,800
Just now better get rid of the doubts.

138
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,050
One thing that one should understand that
Mataji has nothing to gain from us.

139
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,870
We cannot give her anything.

140
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,840
Only we have to take from her.

141
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,080
If you understand that then you’ll have
no doubts because that is one of the fears

142
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,970
some people have that I’m going to start
having something from you.

143
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:49,620
So once you understand that she has nothing
to take away from us, she has to give us something.

144
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,880
Supposing I say there is a diamond available
here free for you, will you doubt me?

145
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,920
You’ll say, “All right, let’s see if
it’s a diamond or a {UNCLEAR].

146
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,950
That’s how your attitude should be.

147
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:06,140
Those who have doubts should know that those
who have doubts will go very slow and they

148
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,900
may be thrown out.

149
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,033
So please don’t have any doubts.

150
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:12,510
A doubting mind is the most troubling thing.

151
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,880
It will never allow you to enjoy your spirit.

152
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,490
There is no need to doubt about it.

153
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,130
Everything is so open, there is no secret
about it.

154
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:33,470
You understand that and try to imbibe the
quality of a good Sahaja Yogi, of a Sahaja

155
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,570
Yogi who is steady.

156
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:42,960
By doubting, the steadiness will go away and
if a tree is not steady how will it imbed

157
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
itself?

158
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,670
It’s important that you should give up all
doubts.

159
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,300
You are so quickly into it.

160
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,130
Seldom we do such a thing, we never have done
like that before.

161
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,540
It’s an experiment.

162
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,850
We want to see now how it works out.

163
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,910
It’s really an experiment.

164
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,750
We have never done like this before.

165
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,070
It’s a very dangerous thing.

166
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:07,200
I’ve seen it that people who get into puja
then they might get little stomach pain or

167
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,050
something will happen to you by which you
get cleared out, little bit.

168
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,900
Not much but then you’ll feel much better
out of that.

169
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,050
So it is a thing that has to happen.

170
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,910
It’s just like an operation which takes
place.

171
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,810
First we used to do is the cleansing of the
chakras of the people.

172
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,300
When they are cleansed and have reached a
certain position then only they were allowed

173
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,750
to do my puja.

174
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:36,200
But I found that when I first came to America
I did not talk about puja at all.

175
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,630
I talked about abstract things.

176
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,900
I didn’t want to say about these things.

177
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,580
We did not do any puja, we did not establish
Shri Ganesha, nothing of the kind, and as

178
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,530
a result of that people who came to me got
lost.

179
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:51,050
I didn’t tell them how to keep their health
all right or about anything.

180
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:56,140
It was just such a short time and the whole
thing was a bad response from people that

181
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,280
I thought it better to leave it now.

182
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,670
But now time has come for all of you to have
it in a big way because you are all seekers

183
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,340
and we cannot delay it anymore.

184
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,530
Come to me without any doubt.

185
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,320
If you have doubts it’s better that you
go away.

186
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,101
It’d be a better idea for me and for you
also.

187
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,930
When you’re doubts are removed then you
come for the puja.

188
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,250
Don’t sit here with your doubts, otherwise
I will have a headache.

189
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,090
Apart from that you will have a headache.

190
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:30,730
So sit in a very cheerful mood, in a receptive
mood and see for yourself what happens to

191
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,730
you.

192
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,220
May God bless you.
