1
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,041
The question was asked Me,

2
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,625
“What Puja we are going to have today?”

3
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,875
And I kept it a secret.

4
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,917
Today we should worship

5
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:45,750
the Paramachaitanya,

6
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,834
the All-Pervading Power of God’s Love.

7
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:04,208
We are aware

8
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,999
that Paramachaitanya

9
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,166
does everything.

10
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,291
At least mentally we know

11
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,500
that everything is worked out

12
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,041
by the grace of Paramachaitanya,

13
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,333
which is the power of the Adi Shakti.

14
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,208
But still,

15
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:38,667
it is not so much in our heart,

16
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:49,625
so much in our attention.

17
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,458
We can consider Paramachaitanya

18
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:59,375
like a ocean,

19
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,000
like a ocean which contains everything within itself.

20
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,667
Everything, all the working,

21
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:17,041
everything, is within its own limits.

22
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,041
So it cannot be compared with anything. You cannot compare it.

23
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,667
Now, if you see the sun,

24
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:29,750
then from the sun

25
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,250
the rays have to come out, to work it.

26
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:40,625
If you see somebody,

27
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:46,291
say, a person

28
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,250
who has an authority,

29
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,500
he has to assert that power -

30
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,625
outside.

31
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,959
So within himself

32
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,000
he doesn’t work it out.

33
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,041
Say, for example, if there’s a seed

34
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,250
and inside the seed only

35
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:27,250
the tree grows, and the fruits come out, and

36
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,875
then they are sold, and people eat it, and

37
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:34,583
everything is inside that seed.

38
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:38,959
Then that is Paramachaitanya.

39
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:47,999
So we are all enveloped in it.

40
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:53,834
And only the waves that we see,

41
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,917
and we are on the waves,

42
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,834
so we see it as

43
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,166
dislocated, separated.

44
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:10,250
Like we feel “this is Germany”

45
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:16,417
or “this is England, this is India.”

46
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:21,500
These are just folds of the sari

47
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,208
of Paramachaitanya

48
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,041
which look separated,

49
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,583
but they are not separated.

50
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:35,000
They are continuous.

51
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,625
So the connection is absolutely complete.

52
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,375
If I pull a thread from here,

53
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:49,709
the thread will throughout be pulled.

54
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:56,709
In the same manner, this Paramachaitanya

55
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,500
is working within itself.

56
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,583
And there is nothing without.

57
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,291
So, when you are Sahaja Yogis,

58
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:23,875
it pays special attention to you.

59
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:28,250
Or, I should say, it becomes absolutely

60
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:30,917
one with you.

61
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,458
Whatever you desire,

62
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:36,834
whatever you want,

63
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,542
also will be coming from the same Paramachaitanya,

64
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,625
if you are one with it.

65
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,750
Like in a, say,

66
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,999
turbulent ocean

67
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:59,375
some drops of water may fly into the air

68
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:03,917
and start thinking that “we are above.”

69
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:09,375
We’re away from the world, away from the ocean.

70
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:13,375
But again they have to fall into the sea.

71
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:20,750
So this formless energy,

72
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,875
which has all the intelligence, all the coordination,

73
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,166
all the organizations,

74
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,917
all the computers,

75
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,959
all the televisions,

76
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,667
all that you can think of communication

77
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:44,291
and of governing, of administration,

78
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,250
and above all,

79
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:53,000
it is the Love,

80
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,959
it is the Love of God

81
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,875
and Love of your Mother.

82
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:13,709
So to be one with this Paramachaitanya,

83
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,208
you have to know

84
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:23,417
that you have to become the reality.

85
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:33,542
For example, if you take a photograph of Mine, sitting here,

86
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:42,291
Maybe My photograph might give you living vibrations, all right,

87
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,375
though it’s a photograph.

88
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:56,999
But, if you take a photograph of somebody else

89
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:06,208
it will not work out Sahaja Yoga.

90
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:13,208
The reason is, that somebody else has not become the reality.

91
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,834
It’s like any other painting if you see,

92
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,917
supposing you see a painting

93
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,458
where it is raining.

94
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,083
This rain does not nourish the flowers.

95
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,583
It does not

96
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:39,667
wet the cloth of the people who are there.

97
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,583
It is static.

98
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,583
So in ignorance,

99
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,041
in ignorance,

100
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:54,458
we just have the

101
00:15:55,999 --> 00:16:00,917
picture which is static about reality.

102
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,375
And that is the reason why

103
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,834
we think we can work it out

104
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:12,125
ourselves, everything.

105
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:18,542
Now if somebody says that, “I see this picture,

106
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:25,999
all right. And I’ll make the rain as a real thing.”

107
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,709
You cannot. Try anything,

108
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,333
put whatever color you like.

109
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:35,417
It may appear, it will appear

110
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,375
with effort.

111
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:42,792
But it will not have the capacity,

112
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:49,041
nor the nature of reality.

113
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,083
So human beings always deal

114
00:16:56,125 --> 00:17:02,125
with unreal things, thinking they are doing something great.

115
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:06,667
We can get flowers which are real, of course.

116
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,500
We can feel them.

117
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,208
We can create plastic flowers.

118
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:19,917
We can create paintings, exactly the same as they are.

119
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:24,667
But we can’t produce one flower

120
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,333
on our own.

121
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:38,041
We’ll have to go to reality

122
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,208
is that the Mother Earth is going to produce it,

123
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:49,125
or the Sun is going to help the Mother Earth.

124
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,875
So all of you Sahaja Yogis

125
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,875
have to know

126
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:07,834
that in reality you do not do anything

127
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,625
and everything is done by Paramachaitanya.

128
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:16,750
This is the difference between a non-Sahaja Yogi and a Sahaja Yogi.

129
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:22,000
A non-Sahaja Yogi does not know.

130
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:28,208
And even if he knows, this is not

131
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:31,125
the truth in his heart.

132
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,250
It’s not a part and parcel of his being.

133
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:38,999
But a Sahaja Yogi knows that

134
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:42,709
reality is Paramachaitanya

135
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:46,959
and it is reality that works out everything.

136
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,250
And then this reality is

137
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,542
the Divine Love.

138
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,500
We always separate love from action.

139
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:04,750
To us love means

140
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:12,500
some sort of a mad behavior towards a person.

141
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,999
It has no technical know-how, how to love.

142
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:24,250
It works without any understanding.

143
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,875
When we love somebody,

144
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,999
we don’t know, what do we do?

145
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:36,750
We think we love you.

146
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:40,166
Tomorrow we start saying, “I hate you.”

147
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:43,709
So how can it be love?

148
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:51,542
We love our own children, love our own family,

149
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,250
love our own friends,

150
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,458
which is so unreal.

151
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:02,250
If it was real,

152
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,208
it would never have failed.

153
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,542
That you cannot definitely say

154
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,333
that, all right, today you’ll work for your son

155
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:16,250
and be very selfish about your son.

156
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,709
But you can’t say tomorrow how he will treat you

157
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,583
or you’ll treat him.

158
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:28,583
But Paramachaitanya knows.

159
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:33,792
It knows how to express its love.

160
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,458
Not only that,

161
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:42,166
but it’s an eternal feeling of love,

162
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:48,458
which may change its hue, color,

163
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,834
but

164
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:59,417
the concern of that love will be the same.

165
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,417
The essence of love is concern.

166
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:08,041
Even if, supposing, somebody does wrong,

167
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,875
the concern of the Divine would be to correct that person.

168
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,583
Concern.

169
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:18,208
Or if we say as “Hita”,

170
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,917
is the benevolence.

171
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,709
So the concern for the benevolence

172
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:26,041
will be all the time there,

173
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,709
whether it may appear to be, sometimes, cruel,

174
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:33,417
might appear to be affectionate,

175
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,667
might appear to be over-indulgent.

176
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:39,542
Whatever it may take a form, like a wave.

177
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,959
Whichever way it may look, but actually,

178
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:47,583
it’s for your benevolence.

179
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,875
It works for your benevolence.

180
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,875
Not only your benevolence,

181
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:58,750
but the collective benevolence.

182
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:04,458
And it knows very well what is to be done

183
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:07,542
how it is to be worked out.

184
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:12,834
It does not have to go and learn from anywhere

185
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,458
because the complete knowledge of all this know-how

186
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:19,917
also is within itself.

187
00:22:22,834 --> 00:22:25,999
It’s such a storage

188
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:32,542
of wisdom, knowledge and love.

189
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:37,709
So it does not deviate.

190
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:42,458
Once you become a Sahaja Yogi, the concern

191
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,792
for your benevolence

192
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,250
is all the time there.

193
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:56,166
Whether you are punished or not is a different point.

194
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,834
Some people might get a job.

195
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,375
Some people will not get a job.

196
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,500
With some people it will work out this way.

197
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:08,625
With some people it will not work out that way.

198
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:11,083
Then one may say that, “How is it, this Paramachaitanya

199
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,083
is behaving like this?”

200
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,208
Is all for your correction.

201
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:18,125
Is a big churning.

202
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,709
Whatever works out for your correction

203
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:22,959
and is for your benevolence.

204
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:25,208
If you understand this point,

205
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:28,917
then you’ll never be disappointed in your life.

206
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:39,208
And it has no concern

207
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,750
of its own benevolence,

208
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:45,917
because it is complete benevolence itself.

209
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:53,000
It never thinks how it is going to be benevolent

210
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:59,458
or helpful, because it has no botheration about it.

211
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:03,709
A man, say, who has everything,

212
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:05,709
worldly things,

213
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:08,583
still may be concerned about getting more,

214
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:11,083
the greed, there would be.

215
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:15,000
But as it is the complete, Purna,

216
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:18,500
it has no greed.

217
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,625
It’s fully satisfied with itself.

218
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,458
And because it is so powerful,

219
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,417
so knowledgeable,

220
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,792
that it has no doubts,

221
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,959
no doubts of any kind.

222
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,500
And because

223
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,792
there’s nobody which can harm it,

224
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:48,083
it has no fear.

225
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:56,083
And you all have now felt

226
00:24:56,375 --> 00:25:00,458
that Paramachaitanya,

227
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:06,875
should give you a complete fearless life,

228
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:10,000
a peaceful life,

229
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,750
and a joyous life.

230
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,166
Like a child who finds his mother, then he stops crying,

231
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,417
no more, now he’s found his mother.

232
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:26,625
In the same way you have found Paramachaitanya

233
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,625
and the connection with it.

234
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:34,000
So you don’t have to worry for anything,

235
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:36,583
don’t have to think about anything,

236
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:39,250
you don’t have to plan about anything,

237
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,875
only thing is you have to jump into it,

238
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:45,125
just jump into it

239
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:51,750
and know that you have become part and parcel of the reality.

240
00:25:54,875 --> 00:26:00,083
This if you have understood, I think, we have done a big job.

241
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:05,875
Now we are in Germany,

242
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:09,166
and you know in Germany

243
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,625
there have been people who have

244
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:17,999
tried to shatter the hopes of human beings.

245
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,583
But

246
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:25,542
even that happening that took place,

247
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:30,208
all those horrible things happened, that so many people died,

248
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:33,667
of course they are born again, no problem,

249
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,166
and such problems came up

250
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,083
that they were

251
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:45,834
thinking that

252
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,959
the whole world will be finished.

253
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,166
They were so much worried,

254
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:55,542
they thought that the whole world will be finished.

255
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,959
But did not.

256
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:03,333
But this war has taught us a lesson.

257
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,333
It has made us more collective.

258
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:12,959
It has made us understand each other.

259
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:17,208
Otherwise, how do you come out of the ignorance

260
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:20,750
that “we are this country”, “we are that country”,

261
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:23,000
racialism,

262
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,917
then this so-called nationalism,

263
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:28,166
so-called patriotism -

264
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:32,834
all these separating forces,

265
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,709
divisive things.

266
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:42,375
Saw clearly we are all human beings

267
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:47,458
and we should be treated as human beings.

268
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,834
If you see the history, after every war

269
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,250
there has been a speedy movement towards knowledge,

270
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:01,999
knowledge of oneness of the world.

271
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,542
It is something

272
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:10,959
like, you have in a spacecraft

273
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:14,999
that a container is built in,

274
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:20,166
one into another,

275
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:25,750
and the whole thing

276
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:32,291
comes into a speed, some velocity,

277
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:37,417
and then the lower container bursts,

278
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,417
or explodes.

279
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:44,625
When it explodes, it gives a higher speed

280
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,959
to the rest of it.

281
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:53,500
And so the acceleration of the velocity takes place.

282
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:57,999
And that’s how one can go into the space.

283
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:02,417
In the same manner,

284
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:06,125
all these horrible things that have happened

285
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:09,750
are explosions

286
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,583
which brings you

287
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:18,583
towards knowledge

288
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:20,792
that there’s something wrong with us,

289
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:24,709
we are living with something unreal.

290
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:31,041
Now the problems, today’s problems as they are,

291
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:40,208
like ecology problem,

292
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,999
AIDS,

293
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,917
drugs,

294
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:54,792
all these modern problems and poverty,

295
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:59,166
if you see it like a witness, you will see

296
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:02,083
these are quite shocking.

297
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:05,625
These are very shocking things.

298
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:10,333
And all these shocking things should really shock our mind,

299
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,041
should really shock our mind.

300
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:18,000
Why we have these problems?

301
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,709
And these problems, some of the stupid leaders think

302
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:28,458
that we can solve by making more money.

303
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,750
We can protect ourselves from ecology if we have more money.

304
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:38,792
And that we can pollute the atmosphere

305
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
because we will have more money.

306
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,792
And then we can protect ourselves

307
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:46,333
so that everybody will have to have a mask,

308
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:49,083
moving about all over the place.

309
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:53,875
But we should make more money to protect ourselves.

310
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:57,875
Doesn’t matter if there is ecological problem, doesn’t matter.

311
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:00,583
So you move about

312
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,375
like a person who is entering

313
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:07,542
into the area which is all full of fumes.

314
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:13,583
All these stupid ideas come up because

315
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:15,542
they do not see

316
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,000
that, what is human dignity is,

317
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:24,166
that human beings are above

318
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:28,333
everything else - above machinery,

319
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:32,500
above all material things of the world.

320
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:37,375
They will not talk, that we'll balance the machinery. No.

321
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:41,041
What they will talk, that we'll make a man

322
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,917
a greater slave of the machinery

323
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,999
because he must have money.

324
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:49,834
He must have more money, and with this more money,

325
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,125
we can protect ourselves against this ecological problem.

326
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,917
It is absurd.

327
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,959
But if you understand the human dignity,

328
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:05,333
then you have to understand that

329
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:08,542
as a human being,

330
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:15,625
we have to take a very positive,

331
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:20,250
wise step to stop all the nonsense we have been doing.

332
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:27,500
Like, now most of the

333
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:30,250
French

334
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:33,250
shores,

335
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:37,500
the beaches, are polluted.

336
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,000
Naturally.

337
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,166
Because they started a funny thing

338
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:45,125
called “holiday making on the seashore.”

339
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,875
So this is the result.

340
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,999
Now, do what you please.

341
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:53,458
You cannot do all that. It has stopped.

342
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,999
So instead of - now human brain is such,

343
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,542
instead of understanding that we have done something wrong,

344
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,000
oh, they will say, “We will start some new method

345
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:05,625
of cleansing this.”

346
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:08,375
They will never condemn

347
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,542
what has gone wrong with them

348
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,041
that they have become so addicted to this kind of a

349
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,834
funny life that they have on the seashores.

350
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,250
Now, AIDS.

351
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:23,500
You’ll be amazed that in America

352
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:27,250
why, even they said that

353
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:31,083
there were in Los Angeles, itself,

354
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:34,709
seven hundred thousand people

355
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,792
who glorified themselves as martyrs of AIDS

356
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:42,834
because they are achieving such a great goal

357
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,208
of leading a life which is nonsensical,

358
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:51,709
as if like a big revolution.

359
00:33:52,792 --> 00:33:56,583
And thinking that they are very, very

360
00:33:56,792 --> 00:34:00,166
great revolutionaries, great people,

361
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:03,875
that they are supporting this AIDS

362
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:11,208
disease and glorifying it.

363
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,875
Can you believe

364
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:19,375
that this kind of

365
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:23,500
assertion will be accepted?

366
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:27,750
People will laugh at you.

367
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,625
But everything is so money-oriented.

368
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,667
They like to advertise it.

369
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:36,208
They want to talk about money help.

370
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:39,458
They want to say that this is happening because

371
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,000
if they had more money,

372
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:46,583
they would have taken more drugs.

373
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,999
Because they have no money, that’s why they are thieving.

374
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:53,667
So we must give them money so that they can take drugs,

375
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:57,792
or they can take to this kind of life.

376
00:34:57,999 --> 00:35:00,542
On the whole, if you see,

377
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,792
people have lived

378
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:05,750
with something which is so unreal

379
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:08,959
all their lives, absolutely unreal.

380
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:12,750
And when it comes to facing it,

381
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:15,333
that we’ve done a mistake,

382
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:18,500
we should not have done this mistake;

383
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:21,417
then they retreat

384
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:24,709
and take another glorious

385
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:28,083
image, artificial and unreal,

386
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:31,750
saying  “Oh, we are great, we are martyrs.”

387
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:41,583
And this is what is, what we call is Kali Yuga

388
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:46,667
where everything that is ignoble, everything that is to be detested,

389
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:51,041
everything from which we should have protection will become

390
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:55,792
the goal of people to achieve.

391
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,375
I hope you have understood

392
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:03,959
that the All-Pervading Power around us

393
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:06,834
is the one that is doing Sahaja Yoga,

394
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,375
is the one that has brought you to Sahaja Yoga,

395
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:12,999
and is the one who has given you blessings,

396
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:14,458
is Paramachaitanya.

397
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:19,375
Through which it has worked out.

398
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:24,125
So today’s prayer should be that we be more and more aware

399
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:28,375
that we are part and parcel of that Paramachaitanya

400
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:31,041
and that we can feel that,

401
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,333
we can use that power, we can work it out.

402
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:38,291
If it is felt today that way,

403
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,917
I think lot of work has been done already

404
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:43,917
and may God bless you for that.

405
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,583
Now.

406
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:05,959
So when you are doing this Puja, please remember

407
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:09,458
that you are worshipping Me as Paramachaitanya

408
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:13,834
and so you have to just think

409
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,792
that you’re dealing with reality itself.

410
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:25,583
With that understanding, you have to do this Puja.

411
00:38:32,792 --> 00:38:35,083
May God bless you.
