1
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,470
no no you see to begin with see it has

2
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,390
something to do with your nervous

3
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:51,090
alright so if your nervous system is

4
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,649
disturbed you may not feel at all what

5
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,630
the nervous system best thing is to do

6
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,390
massage somebody should massage their

7
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:00,149
back hands also I have told many times

8
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,579
that you rub your hands vibrated olive

9
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,739
oil quite a lot and drop these things so

10
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,680
if they become self could be within

11
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,720
sensitivity but if they can feel the

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,369
catches in this in the body that means

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,320
they're all right only that we should is

14
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,300
not all right rub the thing all the

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,580
machine work on we should be clear it

16
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:22,289
out and for we should be if you can use

17
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:24,630
say butter could rub on the here and rub

18
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:26,580
all these muscles listen with that all

19
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,280
these things will work out for your hand

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,440
but supposing you are there's no cool

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,479
breeze coming out of the head possibly

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,310
then the realization is not yet

23
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,300
established see other people should say

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,130
whether there's a cool breeze coming

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,959
because the person who is not realized

26
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,880
may not feeling supposing he does not

27
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:43,500
feel it and you feel it then he's

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,270
realized to only think his chakras are

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,280
to be cleared it's a different different

30
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,649
category of things then there are some

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,660
people whose Kundalini has not risen

32
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,300
there still sahaja yogi like that maybe

33
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,940
I don't know if there are any those

34
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,250
people who are unmarried for long they

35
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,170
are very difficult because they never

36
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,450
feel the cool things in that quite a lot

37
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,099
like that but it is not so they are

38
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,810
realized Souls in any case they may not

39
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,599
feel it but they realized so to see

40
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,520
because it kind of a soft as a kind of a

41
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,040
balance is developed after marriage

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,400
which is not there and that's how some

43
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,830
people don't feel

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,770
there are various reasons some people

45
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,940
who are oriented war they should turn

46
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,010
their left to the right

47
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,290
many at times they should find out from

48
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,239
the hands you see one hand is bigger one

49
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,130
hand is smaller that means the left side

50
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,140
if it is smaller that means you have to

51
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,550
raise left over that you see from the

52
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,410
size of the hands and all that you can

53
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,569
see putting one hand towards the

54
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,550
photograph another hand outside work it

55
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:41,769
out in so many ways because you have

56
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,540
permutations and combinations of certain

57
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:44,860
mistakes but that doesn't mean you

58
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,840
develop this left it should be by any

59
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,400
chance because that's the worst thing

60
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,780
that can happen if you develop the left

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:57,420
Rashidi then it's a very difficult

62
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,420
situation now

63
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,849
for this kind of a thing I think I will

64
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:06,519
give you a complete lecture on one day

65
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,890
complete as to see what permutations and

66
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:12,390
combinations of different chakras can

67
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,390
feel all right

68
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:19,359
but symptoms are outside the symptoms

69
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,670
are mostly outside there's no need to

70
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:28,840
from a personality to see what it is

71
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:31,180
since that is a very problem with a

72
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,769
problem with people that they don't feel

73
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,650
the vibration some people just don't

74
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:38,500
really how many there are like that

75
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:44,739
who never feel any vibration never

76
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:47,130
friend no you never your felt it

77
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:47,130
sometime

78
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:57,480
[Music]

79
00:03:51,959 --> 00:04:04,170

left side catch all right you can see

clearly a right hand is very shining the

83
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,870
left there is a problem you see this

84
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:15,090
these fingers are not so shiny as the

85
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,609
things are you had a left side problem

86
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,799
if you remember it all right so that's

87
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:21,060
fighting in the ashram the vibrations

88
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,770
are fighting that's why I feel hot

89
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,600
there's something wrong it will correct

90
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,570

will correct
