1
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,126
Now at Hamsa Chakra, this understanding must come

2
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:19,926
that you must balance both the nadis, 
the left and the right.

3
00:00:19,926 --> 00:00:25,693
Now to balance the left and the right,
the best way is to do some breathing,

4
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:33,293
is to take the air through one nostril
and keep it waiting here for a while

5
00:00:33,293 --> 00:00:36,059
and then allow it to go out of the other.

6
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,959
Then you breathe in with this one,

7
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:42,259
allow it to stay here for a while and
then allow it to go down.

8
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:45,459
But it is to be done very slowly.

9
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:49,459
Not in a hurry, not too much.
 Only thrice.

10
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:51,559
Best thing as I’ve told you is neti.

11
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:53,813
If not that, another thing I have seen

12
00:00:53,893 --> 00:00:58,392
that those inhalers, you see that you get, are very good.

13
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:07,926
The neti thing that I’ve given you.
 If you fill the water below the spout and fill it,

14
00:01:07,926 --> 00:01:13,359
put in some two, three drops of one of those things
that you get for inhaling

15
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:19,626
and put that neti thing in one nose only,
and with another nose it goes up.

16
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:23,259
Then you come, bring it here, it goes up and clears it out.

17
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:25,079
It’s a very good thing.

18
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:31,107
If you do it every night before sleeping, in 
three, four days you’ll be absolutely cleared out.

19
00:01:31,812 --> 00:01:36,400
But the main thing is: it comes because 
of imbalances in our temperaments.
