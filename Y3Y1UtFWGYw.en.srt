00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Public Program, Teesside Polytechnic, Middlesbrough (England), 31 July 1984.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,080
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,000
First of all, we have to know what truth means.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,000
We want to seek truth,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,240
there’s an urge within us that we have to seek the truth.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,240
Because of this seeking only we all have become human beings.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now after human beings' stage, what is going to happen to us?

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,000
As it is, you find there is so much of confusion in this world,

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,000
so much of confusion, so many ideas, so many thoughts,

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
so many ideologies, so many religions. All kinds of things

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
have come up and a simple human starts looking at it

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,000
and he gets quite puzzled,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
“What sort of thing this world is?”

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,000
It’s a very confused world, first of all.

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,000
The confusion gives you a greater urge to seek,

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,000
because you find, “What’s this going on?”

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,280
Secondly, I went round your city today

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,080
just to vibrate the whole place

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and I felt the place has got a kind of a feeling of dullness

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,160
and I asked the person who was driving Me,

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,160
I said, “Why the people here are looking very dull?”

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He said, “The people are now without any jobs,”

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
so, I said that should happen to any country which is so industrially developed.

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,000
When we are industrially developed, you see,

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,080
all our industrial wants are over perhaps,

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,280
then we start seeking more

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
because we think now we’ve got everything,

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
we’ve got proper dress to wear, we’ve got food, we’ve got everything,

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
now what next? And that’s how we become dull

30
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,080
because we don’t understand the meaning of life.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now this meaning of life is more in the people who are affluent

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,080
and has to be less in the people who are still developing

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,000
because they want to become like you,

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
have all plastics around them,

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
they want to have foundries with all pollution, everything.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Once they have that then they will start seeking.

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,080
But in a country like India

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,280
which has been a very different type of a country I say,

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
because of climatic position. It’s very good climate,

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
like this, it is always there, so you can be always out in the villages,

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
you can be in the forest and you don’t have to worry so much

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
to fight the nature. So in such a place people have been meditating

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and trying to find out, “Why are we here?”

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Now all these things when you see the development everywhere,

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,080
you find it’s like the tree, the tree outside you see very well developed.

46
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,000
But any tree that has developed very much must have very deep roots,

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
otherwise it will be all finished and destroyed.

48
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,080
So when there is such a lot of development outside,

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,000
there must have been some development inside also, the roots.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And this is what we are going to tell you about the roots now

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
because your development is sufficiently enough and if

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,080
you have to sustain this development you must know about your roots.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We have neglected our roots very much

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and that’s the reason today we also find people suffering

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
from terminal diseases and all kinds of trouble.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That is one of the first worry for Me

57
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,080
that everyone should be healthy

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,160
and that health comes to you not from outside, from inside.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,080
Because supposing if on a tree you find a leaf is sick

60
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,080
and you start treating the leaf, you don’t treat the tree.

61
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,000
You don’t treat the disease at all.

62
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,000
But if you have some means of entering into the roots, you treat

63
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:57,000
the whole of that tree very well, very easily in a very simple manner.

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,000
In the same way if you can somehow reach your roots,

65
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:08,000
you can treat yourself without much difficulty, without any medicine also.

66
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,000
Now where are these roots?

67
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,000
Uh, for that you have to see to this chart,

68
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,000
I don’t know if everybody can see this chart,

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
that within us this beautiful instrument is placed,

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and this is what is described in the Bible as the tree of life.

71
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:30,080
Unless and until you achieve a state which we call as self-realization,

72
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,000
which Christ called as the second birth

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,080
we cannot understand what is this.

74
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,000
Because now you are listening to Me very closely

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
but if I say, “Pay attention to yourself within,” you cannot.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It’s a difficult thing, our attention is outside.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Now what should happen for that?

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There’s a happening that takes place,

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,160
because of that happening your attention is attracted inside.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,240
And once the attention is inside,

81
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,080
the same attention gets the enlightenment of this power

82
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,000
which is within you, us in the sacrum bone,

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
sacrum meaning sacred, that means the Greeks knew about it.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,080
When this power rises, awakens, it’s like the plumule in the seed,

85
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,000
the germinating power of a seed

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and it just gives you a new dimension.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,080
It enriches your subtle centers.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
These subtle centers actually are the subtle entities of the gross plexuses.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,280
When they’re exhausted you suffer from diseases.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Now for example, today’s article made Me think that I should tell you

91
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,000
how we get a particular disease called horrible cancer

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and that is so common in the West,

93
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,000
not so much in the developing countries as it is here.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They say cancer is a rich man’s disease.

95
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,000
The thing is that within us there are two systems,

96
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,000
of nervous systems which cater us.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
One of them is the one called as the central nervous system

98
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,000
another is the one which we call as autonomous nervous system.

99
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,000
Now the doctors are honest, they just call it by name, autonomous.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Now if you ask them, “Who is this auto,” they won’t be able to tell you.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Just they call it some name, autonomous.

102
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,080
This auto is the Spirit in the heart

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and this auto if you somehow or other bring into your attention

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,280
the light of the auto comes into your attention,

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,280
you start controlling your being completely.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This is a simple method I’m telling you.

107
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,000
Now the nature of the roots is such

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
that this autonomous nervous system has three channels.

109
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,240
The two channels of the left and the right sympathetic nervous system

110
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and the central one is the parasympathetic. Now you can see here

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
the three channels but these are the subtle channels

112
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:12,000
which control, which control the gross channels.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,080
Now these subtle channels work out in such a way

114
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,000
that the left-side channel caters to your past,

115
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,000
caters to what has happened, caters to your conditioning

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,080
It is what we call is the channel of the moon,

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
or this is the one that works out the power of desire within us.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The right-side channel is the channel which works out the action,

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,240
so it is the channel of the action, caters to your future,

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,160
to your mental activities and to your physical activities.

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,240
It is called as the channel of the sun.

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Now both of them are parallel to each other.

123
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,080
Now when a human being tries to find out something,

124
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,000
he tries always to go to the extremes, in anything.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Supposing he goes to the pub then he must drink the whole of it.

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,240
If he goes to some other work, he must finish off his work with

127
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
completely dedication, as they call it and exhaust all his life doing that.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,160
Always we go to extremes, either to the left or to the right.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,160
Now if a person is a person of moderation, he stays in the center.

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The central path is for our evolution.

131
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,280
The whole of matter has evolved, as you know there’s a chart

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and in the chart if you find the periodic laws the nature are

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
so beautifully made and it is all very much balanced.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And in the center lies the carbon

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and the carbon is in the first center lies within us.

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Now all these centers are nothing but the steps of our evolution.

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,280
Like we were first carbon, then we became animals,

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
then we became human beings and now we are seekers.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,280
That’s how we develop one after another and the evolution takes place

140
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and we become human beings.

141
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Now the question comes, what next?

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,080
Why are we here?

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We are human beings but what are we to achieve next.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,160
If this question doesn’t come into your mind

145
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
then it will come later on, no doubt,

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
but it’s better that the time is here for you to seek that;

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
why are we on this earth?

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We are here on this earth, like this instrument if you make,

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
you’ll ask, “Mother why are you making this instrument?”

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
This instrument is made to carry My voice.

151
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
In the same way you, the human beings are made instruments of God.

152
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,080
Now you are to be employed by God and He’s going to use you

153
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,000
and this power is going to flow through you.

154
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Only thing is, you have to be connected to the mains

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and this connection takes place through the ascent of this Kundalini

156
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
which is actually the Holy Ghost in the Bible.

157
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,000
In the Bible nothing has been written about Holy Ghost as such.

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I asked a priest, “What do you mean by Holy Ghost?”

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So he tells Me, “I’m agnostic about it.”

160
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,000
So I said, “Then why are you there? What are you doing?”

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So he says, “I’m doing my job.”, you see.

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,240
There’s no job in God’s realm,

163
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
like that where you can get money without knowing what you are doing.

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You’re supposed to know what you are doing.

165
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,000
You are supposed to know what Holy Ghost is

166
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and you are supposed to know where it is.

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You just cannot get a job, become something

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,080
and profess something without knowing much about it.

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And this is what is the dilemma of today’s religions,

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
not one but all of them.

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,080
They do not know that they have to be born again,

172
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,000
first of all, to profess any religion.

173
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,000
Christ has said so clearly that you are to be born again.

174
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,080
And when Nicodemus asked Him, “What do you mean by born again?

175
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,000
Have I to enter into my womb again?” He said, “No.

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The flesh gives birth to flesh but I’m talking about the Holy Spirit.

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The Holy Spirit has to give birth to your Spirit.”

178
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And that’s what it is, the Holy Spirit within you

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
is this three and a half-coiled Kundalini or the Holy Spirit.

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,160
Now through meditative processes because as I told you

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
the attention of Indians was more inward

182
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
so they tried to find out how we are made.

183
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,000
And this is not the knowledge of today, it’s a very ancient knowledge.

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
A book written about a person fourteen thousand years back

185
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,160
has described in all details all the things I’m telling you

186
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
but we have never come to know about it.

187
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Neither we tried to look at it. Even about Christ there’s so much

188
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,000
written in those books thousands of years back

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
About Mohamad thousands of years back,

190
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
we never try to translate those things

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
or bring this knowledge to that level that everybody could read it.

192
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But now it is possible for you to understand

193
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,280
that you’re not only the body, mind, ego, superego,

194
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,080
but you’re something much more.

195
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,080
And that much more is the Spirit

196
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,000
and the truth is that you have to become the Spirit.

197
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,080
Once you become the Spirit,

198
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,000
means when you become the light

199
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,080
what you do exactly is to give the light.

200
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But before that there are lots of hurdles,

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,280
like as I told you there’s cancer, this, that, all kinds of diseases

202
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
that hurt human beings.

203
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
There are mental diseases, there are emotional problems,

204
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
there are all kinds of problems and they can only be solved

205
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,000
if you go to your roots.

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,080
Now let us see a simple case of cancer,

207
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,160
for Me, it is simple because it can be cured very simply.

208
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Now for example, you take one of the centers,

209
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,280
it’s like this within us, like this, you can see, all of you.

210
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And this center is inside here.

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
While this is the left and the right sympathetic nervous systems

212
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,160
and in the center, we can say is the parasympathetic

213
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,080
which supplies the balance,

214
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
which supplies all the energy that is needed for the left and the right.

215
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,000
When we go into any emergency, for example, if you start running

216
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
then the heart starts pulsating very fast

217
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But it comes to normal through the central path of parasympathetic.

218
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Now what happens that this center supposing

219
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
is used too much because of our extreme habits,

220
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
you see, you use too much. Anyway, then what happens, that

221
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:52,000
starts breaking this chain and you lose your contact with the whole.

222
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Then you become on your own, means you become malignant.

223
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,160
The cells become malignant; they start eating other cells

224
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,000
without any relationship to the whole.

225
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You don’t know how far to go.

226
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Supposing you develop a cancer of the nose,

227
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,240
the nose cells start becoming bigger, they start eating other cells

228
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and whosoever they touch, like an egotistical man, like Hitler,

229
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
whosoever they touch, that cell again becomes malignant

230
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,000
and then that starts eating and that’s how the whole body

231
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,080
becomes malignant. This is how cancer is set in, a simple thing.

232
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,280
But recently, about a year back, I saw a very interesting

233
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
television show of the doctors. They said that

234
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
the vulnerability of cancer is present in every human being

235
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,280
because we live on extremes all the time,

236
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
but the triggering takes place when some entity attacks you

237
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
from the area built in within you since your creation.

238
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,280
And this area we call in Sahaja Yoga as the collective subconscious.

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That is whatever is dead within us resides in that area.

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Now this is the area beyond the left sympathetic.

241
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So those people who go too much to the left side,

242
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,280
too much to the emotional side

243
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,240
or those who go and bow to wrong type of gurus,

244
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,160
wrong type of people and accept wrong type of religions I should say

245
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
where you take to dead, to spiritualists, spiritual work and

246
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
all those things are very much vulnerable to diseases like cancer.

247
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,000
Cancer is not the right-side disease

248
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
but heart attack could be a right side as well as a left side disease.

249
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Like in Sahaja Yoga we have two types of hearts, not one type.

250
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,160
One is the over active, another is the lethargic heart.

251
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,080
Now the people who are over active, you see, all the time running,

252
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:55,000
looking at the watches and just on the run, you see,

253
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
all such people have an over active heart

254
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
which is absolutely exhausted.

255
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,080
And the attention is so much outside that the Spirit in the heart

256
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
is agitated and it recedes and you get a heart attack.

257
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,000
Now there’s another type of a heart which is lethargic,

258
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
which takes to emotional side, weeps all the time, sings about the past,

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
“My father was so rich and I’m so poor,” all those things, you see,

260
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
specially the ladies have that problem.

261
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And then when they start talking too much about the left side

262
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
then what happens, the lethargic heart becomes a problem

263
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
because you develop symptoms like angina and all these things.

264
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,080
So we have two types of hearts.

265
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,280
Now you cannot treat a person who has two styles,

266
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I mean, everybody cannot be treated the same way

267
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
because we have two types of heart troubles.

268
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Now in the medical science which I have done Myself

269
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
is there’s only one type of human being.

270
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,000
They do not separate one from another.

271
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But in everyday life you see we are so different from each other.

272
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So there are three types of people actually,

273
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
one of them are the ones who are futuristic,

274
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
another are the ones who live in the past

275
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,080
and the others who are in the center.

276
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,000
And they have three types of combinations then,

277
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
that permutations and combinations work out with these,

278
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
mainly, we should say, nine types of people.

279
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But then there can be even greater permutations and combinations

280
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,160
depending on the kinds of people they meet, the kinds of people

281
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
they admire or live with, or dominated with or dominate.

282
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So we have very complicated human beings in this world,

283
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
doesn’t matter but they can brought down to the simple thing

284
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
as left, right and center.

285
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,160
If you can bring them down and classify them to these three things

286
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
it’s very easy to treat them.

287
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,000
Because if somebody is a right-sided person,

288
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
he’ll have certain symptoms, he’ll be hot-tempered fellow,

289
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
he’ll have a liver trouble. he’ll be thin,

290
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
he’ll be shouting all the time on top of his voice.

291
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
He may be good outside but in his family he would be very hot-tempered.

292
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,000
He may be a person who is egoistical but maybe

293
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
that he’ll look very humble because he has to deal with people

294
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,000
and maybe that he may be very, very aggressive

295
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
to such a point that he might become sadistic.

296
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Now the another type are the other ones who want always to run away,

297
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
escape, they could be these, not people who will be grossly aggressive

298
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,000
but will be very sly and will be trying all tricks and playing games

299
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,080
and intrigues and all sorts of things

300
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,000
and also, they will be living with their past, this type of thing.

301
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,000
Now there are people who are in the center,

302
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
the people who are moderate, who take life pleasantly,

303
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,080
not bothered so much about life, life’s complications

304
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,000
but keep above it. And they lead a very normal life,

305
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
they do not indulge into any nonsensical things.

306
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
These are the central type of people and that’s why

307
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
all the religions came on this earth to establish that balance within.

308
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Religions, all of them came on this earth to establish that balance.

309
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,080
Why the balance, again the question can come up, why the balance.

310
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,000
The balance is for our ultimate ascent,

311
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
for example, if you have to take an aero plane, ascend it,

312
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
you have to first see if it is balanced or not,

313
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
otherwise, it will be not floating horizontally

314
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
but it might go one-sided, you see so one has to have a balance in life.

315
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But if you read yourself, if you face yourself you will understand that,

316
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
“No, we are not so much balanced as we should have been.”

317
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So this balance has to be brought in, in human beings

318
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and that’s why we had great prophets on this earth

319
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,000
to teach us the balance.

320
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And these prophets came at a time where we needed this balance,

321
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,000
at every time people became imbalanced, they came on this earth

322
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
to teach us balance.

323
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
When this balance is lost, mostly we develop diseases.

324
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Even in religious things we can be very imbalanced.

325
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Like I’ve seen people reading Bible for three hours,

326
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
what is the need to read Bible?

327
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,000
I mean, for three hours you don’t learn anything.

328
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Actually, if you understand religion, is not to be read,

329
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
but to be felt and experienced within yourself.

330
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Religion is like the ten valences of human beings.

331
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And the ten valences of the human beings

332
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
when we lose the valence, we lose our balance.

333
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,000
Now anything like, say a country

334
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
which is over-developed loses its balance.

335
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,000
A country which is under-developed also can lose its balance.

336
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,080
Anywhere it can happen the same way,

337
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,280
makes no difference whether you’re developed or under-developed,

338
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
you are in the same way whether the balance is up or down,

339
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
makes no difference. So it is like that.

340
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Now with the Kundalini what happens,

341
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
the first thing it does is to create the balance within.

342
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
When She rises in that part of the thing, area of the stomach

343
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
it creates the balance, it brings forth the balance.

344
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Once the balance has come then it’s much easier for you

345
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,160
to balance all the chakras which have gone upside down

346
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
or which are crooked and the balance comes and fix them together.

347
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,080
With that balance the chakras get their forms all right

348
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,000
and because of that the Kundalini rises.

349
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
She rises and pierces through your fontanelle bone area

350
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,160
which is the true baptism.

351
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It’s not like somebody coming putting water onto your head

352
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,160
and say, “Now you’re baptized.” And we accept it.

353
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It’s just an exercise, there’s no truth about it.

354
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,000
The cool breeze of the Holy Ghost has to be felt on top of your head.

355
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,000
So the truth has to be felt on your central nervous system,

356
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,080
that means you must feel them on your fingertips.

357
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Mohamad Sahib has clearly said that

358
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
at the time of Resurrection your hands will speak.

359
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But nobody wants to talk of Resurrection,

360
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,000
nobody wants to talk of something that is good to happen,

361
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
that there will be a period where people will be redeemed,

362
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
that there will be a Redeemer, there will be a Counsellor;

363
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
nobody wants to talk of that.

364
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,080
They want to talk of the doomsday because people will be frightened

365
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,000
and they’ll be pouring money for them.

366
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It’s a money-making fright which is created in people.

367
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,080
The God Almighty who has created this beautiful universe

368
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
has created you as special people who are human beings,

369
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
do you think He’s going to allow us to destroy His great creation?

370
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
He’s made us so beautifully within ourselves

371
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
and we have to just understand that you’re not what you seem to be,

372
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,160
you’re much greater, you’re much more, you are glorified by Him.

373
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,280
Because only this thing has to happen and once it happens

374
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
you’ll be surprised that you become in charge of yourself,

375
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,160
that you become empowered with that power of God

376
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,240
which flows through you.

377
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You can cure people, you can help people, you can raise Kundalini,

378
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
you can get rid of all these stupid problems,

379
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,080
all these big problems and all the universal problems

380
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
because a transformation takes place within you.

381
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,280
We had an alcoholic in Brighton one day,

382
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
he came to the program completely drunk and he started abusing Me.

383
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,000
I just smiled at him. Next day he came and he got his realization.

384
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Today he’s a first-class man, he’s earning such a lot of money,

385
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,000
he’s doing so well.

386
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So what happens to you that you become yourself

387
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and to become yourself means you become the Spirit,

388
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and Spirit is the reflection of God within yourself.

389
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Once that happens, you become the dynamic power of God

390
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,080
and you’re surprised the miraculous way you’re helped.

391
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,080
Now of course, Sahaja Yoga has definitely cured cancer, no doubt,

392
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
it can cure so many diseases.

393
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,280
But when we wrote to the British council about it

394
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,080
and they found out that we were curing people, they said,

395
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
“There’s a big red tape going on,” they’ve to go through the files,

396
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
they have to find out, this, that.

397
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So we said, “All right, doesn’t matter, let them have their own time.”

398
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But Sahaja Yoga is not only for physical being

399
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,000
because you are not only physical being.

400
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I tell you there are many wrestlers and boxers

401
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,240
who come to Me and say, “Mother,” who are very, very sturdy people,

402
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
they say, “Mother, we have no peace, give us peace.”

403
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,240
So it is not for physical being, it is not for mental being,

404
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
it’s not for emotional being but it is for your spiritual being.

405
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But as you’re the temple of God, the temple has to be cleansed.

406
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
When some guest is coming to your house, we clean the house,

407
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,000
make it beautiful, put flowers, decorate it.

408
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,160
In the same way, when your Spirit is going to enter into your attention

409
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
your body has to be cleansed; your mind has to be purified

410
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,240
and that you have to become a beautiful temple for that enlightenment.

411
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,280
And that’s how as a by-product of this Kundalini awakening you get cured.

412
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,200
Now what happens to your awareness,

413
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,000
that you become collectively conscious.

414
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,080
You become, again I say there’s no certificate.

415
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,320
In Sahaja Yoga there’s no membership,

416
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,080
of course you must have heard, there’s no money to be paid or anything.

417
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,280
I mean, it is stupid, how can you pay money to God,

418
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,160
what does He understand about money?

419
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,080
How much money are you going to pay for yourself, first of all?

420
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,080
He has given beautiful eyes to us, what do we pay Him, nothing;

421
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,040
on the contrary we spoil them all the time

422
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,280
by looking at things with lust and greed, we spoil them.

423
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,240
We have adultery in our eyes, so we spoil them, the beautiful

424
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,040
innocent eyes that He has given us, the pure eyes, we spoil them.

425
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,280
But when you’re awakened, your eyes become so beautiful

426
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,160
that you look at the person, the person gets all right.

427
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,080
Your presence, merely your presence can help so many.

428
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,000
But you have to achieve that state.

429
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,120
Now as he said, you cannot demand it, you see, there’s no shop here.

430
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,280
In a shop you pay the money so you can demand,

431
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,200
“All right, come along, this was bad and I paid so much money.”

432
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:35,280
But here what do you give? Your seeking, you’re seeking the higher being,

433
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,080
you are not seeking your cure but you’re seeking

434
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,040
the higher being within you.

435
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,280
The property, the wealth of spirituality that resides in all of us.

436
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:50,080
It is there, it is all there, only thing we have to pay attention to it and get it.

437
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,280
Now you become collectively conscious means you start feeling

438
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,080
other people on your fingertips.

439
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,200
Even a child can say, “This is the problem, this is the problem,”

440
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,080
now you have to just know what these denote

441
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,080
and that’s what I have decoded that this means heart,

442
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,080
this means something else, this means something else

443
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,080
and all the centers, the five and the sixth and the seventh centers,

444
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,000
on the left and the right-hand side.

445
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,080
So immediately you’ll know the person’s suffering.

446
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,040
But we don’t talk like doctors, we don’t say,

447
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,120
“This fellow is egoistical,” not like that.

448
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,320
But we’ll say, “His Agnya chakra in the front is catching,”

449
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,240
that means he’s egoistical. But we don’t say that.

450
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,080
Even a person will come and say, “Mother today my Agnya is catching,

451
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,280
just take it out,” meaning, “I’ve been egoistical.”

452
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,000
So the language is different as you must have read in the Bible

453
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,280
that when they got their realization through the Holy Ghost

454
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,040
they started speaking in strange languages.

455
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,080
That doesn’t mean that they started speaking in Latin or Hebrew.

456
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,080
It means that they started speaking in the languages of chakras,

457
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,280
of centers, of the subtle centers.

458
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,200
They started talking about the channels,

459
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,280
because you become subtle, you start seeing something subtle.

460
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,320
Like the way you see colors, animals do not see.

461
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,080
The way you see filth and dirt the animals do not see.

462
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,080
But when you become realized souls you see the dirt and filth of a

463
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:17,000
much subtler nature. That is the sin that they call it or anything like that.

464
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,080
So you become separated from this,

465
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,160
and you start witnessing the whole world like a witness.

466
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,120
You become collectively conscious, so supposing you get cured,

467
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,080
so-called by Me, so-called, I would say, then there’s no obligation

468
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,080
because if you’re part and parcel of Me, whom do I help?

469
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,080
If this finger is paining and I rub it like this, whom do I help,

470
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,080
I help Myself, isn’t it?

471
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,320
So you become part and parcel of the whole

472
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,080
and when you become part and parcel of the whole,

473
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,160
the whole thing works out in such a homogenous way.

474
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,200
As a result of that the people in England

475
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,080
who were suffering from many diseases, people in Australia,

476
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,040
so many countries now we have,

477
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,200
most of the European countries we have tackled, have been cured.

478
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,280
They have been cured of their diseases, of their ailments,

479
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,240
they’ve become so powerful that they have no habits,

480
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,240
nothing can deter them. They’re very joyous, happy people,

481
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,000
if you see their photographs, you’ll say they’re lotuses sitting down

482
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,040
beautifully pink. And the same thing is happening in India

483
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,240
where I’m working for a much shorter time than I have worked in England.

484
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,160
England has a special place; I must say because in the universe

485
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,160
England is the heart of the universe.

486
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,280
Perhaps you do not realize, you’re not aware of it.

487
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
But English are very balanced people compared to

488
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,280
all other Western people, I must say. But despite that

489
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,280
sometimes you go off because you’ve lost your confidence,

490
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,280
you try to follow French, you try to follow Americans,

491
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,120
they have to follow you, not that you have to follow them.

492
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,200
You can articulate.

493
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,120
Now once upon a time it was the industrial development

494
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,240
and all these things were there, so you articulated into these

495
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,120
but now that is over. Now it has to be spiritual development,

496
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,040
for that also I think one has to work out in England.

497
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,160
And that’s how perhaps My husband got elected to this job

498
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,160
and had to come to England. I’ve been here for ten years

499
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,320
while in India I was just two years after I started My work.

500
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,080
Of course I travel all over and the most wonderful thing I’ve found out

501
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:29,160
about the Western people is that their hankering is no more now

502
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,080
for material things. It looks little bit but is not so much.

503
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,320
Once they get to their realization, they want to save others,

504
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,200
they want to help others.

505
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,160
Now all the way Dr. Warren has come from Australia.

506
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,080
Now they said the psychology is such

507
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,080
if the Australians talk to the English, they feel happy.

508
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:54,160
So we sent English to America and you’ll be surprised that in Houston

509
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,080
an Englishman went there and he was regarded as a very

510
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,280
respectable man, you see, and they all listened to him nicely.

511
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,320
It’s a funny psychology but we have great Sahaja Yogis even in England.

512
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,200
In England we have very great people who have mastered this art

513
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,120
and once you know this you become so scholarly

514
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
that many a times

515
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,080
these newspaper people ask Me,

516
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,240
“Have you got all your disciples as scholars?”

517
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,280
I said, “No, they’re not My disciples, they’re children.”

518
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,280
But they become scholarly because they get to the essence of knowledge

519
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and this is the true knowledge.

520
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,320
The otherwise whatever knowledge we have is of the dead.

521
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,080
For example I was looking at your foundries, what do we do?

522
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,040
We take out the dead and make something out of it.

523
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Can we make anything living? Can we transform these flowers into fruits?

524
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,040
We cannot. After realization you start doing the living work

525
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,240
and this is the process which a living work of living God.

526
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,320
So you just cannot say that, “I stand on my head

527
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,320
and I get the Kundalini there,” or, “I cut my hair short or

528
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,080
I have another kind of a dress.” It’s nothing outside.

529
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,160
It’s inside the happening takes place and you become another person.

530
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,320
In Sanskrit language we call a bird as dwijaha, means born again

531
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,120
and a Brahmin, the one who has known the power of Brahma,

532
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,240
the power of God’s love, is called also dwijaha.

533
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,240
Dwijaha, means the one who is born again.

534
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:37,080
Now a bird is first is an egg and then it becomes a bird.

535
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:43,120
That’s why you’ll be surprised that Christ when He was crucified

536
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,160
and when He was resurrected on the Easter day it is to show

537
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,280
that a person leaves this material body and becomes the Spirit.

538
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,080
Resurrection is the message of Christ which is a very great thing

539
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,360
He achieved because He was nothing but Himself the Brahma,

540
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,400
the Chaitanya, Omkara, what you call the word. So that’s why He could

541
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,320
achieve that thing. It’s all written about Him in Indian Scriptures.

542
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,080
You have to go out to see all these things,

543
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,280
what is the thing written about Christ.

544
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,080
Bible cannot contain Him within Himself

545
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,080
and the four years life that He led in this misery

546
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,040
is not representative of His whole background.

547
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,240
If you have to know about His background you have to read

548
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,160
some books which were written fourteen thousand years back.

549
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,280
They have told about that. So when He resurrected what we do,

550
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:42,200
we present an egg on the Easter Sunday. What does that mean?

551
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:47,080
That on an Easter Sunday you’re an egg and on the Easter Monday

552
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:53,080
you are the bird. But we don’t know, we do it just automatically

553
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,320
without understanding why we give those eggs to people.

554
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,320
This is what we have to understand. Even to understand Bible

555
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,280
we have to be self-realized, even to understand the life of Christ

556
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,240
which was just so great we have to be realized.

557
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,080
Now the controversy about Christ has started, it really pains Me

558
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,080
that these people don’t want to take their realization,

559
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,120
otherwise how can you explain to them any miracle whatsoever?

560
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,400
Life is full of miracles.

561
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,120
Even in My lifetime people have seen miracles happening.

562
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,040
I don’t know if they have brought the photograph. Once I was giving

563
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,160
a lecture in a very remote village where there was a very great soul

564
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,280
who had died. And as soon as I entered the village I told them,

565
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,200
“Who was the great soul who lived here?”

566
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,320
They said he was a Muslim called as Mian.

567
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,240
And I sat down for My lecture and suddenly I found that I got connected

568
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,280
and there was a big light on My head coming.

569
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,280
And then I saw it seven times the light was there and I got connected

570
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,080
and it showed that, that he was there with Me.

571
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,000
And then suddenly I stopped it, like this laughing.

572
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,320
Imagine the photograph was taken by one girl

573
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,240
and all these seven stages were clearly shown

574
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,080
and you could see the light there.

575
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,360
Now these boys went to show to someone, they said,

576
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,120
“Oh, you must have arranged all these in the village.”

577
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,280
But it was not, in that remote village there is no electricity also.

578
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,280
So where’s the question of… and why should we arrange that?

579
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,280
There are so many miracles that have taken place in Sahaja Yoga,

580
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,080
so many miracles.

581
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,400
I mean the President of India was cured of his cancer

582
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,320
in five minutes, you won’t believe it.

583
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
He came to London from his operation

584
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,040
and it was very unsuccessful and he was going to die.

585
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,320
And because of My husband I went to see him.

586
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,240
We knew him otherwise but he didn’t know Me

587
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,040
that I was also Mataji Nirmala Devi

588
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,080
because I don’t tell this to these bureaucrats,

589
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,080
they’re rather difficult people.

590
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,320
So it so happened that one of the…

591
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,200
that was B. K. Nehru who was the High Commissioner,

592
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,160
he told, “Do you know this lady is Mataji Nirmala Devi?”

593
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,240
And the wife of the President had heard My name

594
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,320
as Mataji Nirmala Devi also

595
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,160
and she said, “Mataji, why don’t you cure my husband?”

596
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,200
And he said, “Yes I didn’t know you were Mataji Nirmala Devi.”

597
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,080
I said, “All right.” So I put My hand on his back.

598
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,400
In five minutes…, he could not sleep, he was so much with pain.

599
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,400
He said, ”I’m feeling so relieved I want to lie down and sleep.”

600
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,120
He went off to sleep. They had prepared for his cremation

601
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,080
and everything in India and a big show was there, imagine,

602
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,080
and they reached with the ambulance there.

603
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,080
And there he walked down the steps and they saw him, they thought,

604
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,200
“Is this his ghost walking or what?”

605
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,240
He told Me all the story in a very jocular way

606
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:44,320
and he said that, “I don’t know, I went, after that I forgot that I was sick

607
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,360
and I went on a tour.” And next year when I went his wife showed Me

608
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,320
that even the mark of the operation had gone, but I must say he must

609
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,120
have been a very great soul to get that way, in such a simple way.

610
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,240
And then he said, “You must have Mother some land because you must

611
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,080
have some place where people should meet you.”

612
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,240
And so he allotted some land to us

613
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,400
and that’s how now we have some land in Delhi.

614
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,280
But what I’m trying to tell you that miracles are the nature of God.

615
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,400
For human beings He’s miraculous, isn’t it? He’s not human being,

616
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
how can we judge Him with our limited brain?

617
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,480
He can do whatever He likes and He is full of miracles.

618
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,240
These intellectuals cannot understand Him.

619
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,040
For example, Paul, he was an intellectual,

620
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,120
he was no way a free man, he was not a realized soul

621
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,080
and how can he understand Christ, he cannot.

622
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,080
Because he was just an organizer and intellectual.

623
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,000
You have to be a realized soul and you’ll be surprised Khalil Gibran

624
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,080
has clearly written about Paul if you read him because Khalil Gibran

625
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,280
was a realized soul that, “I can’t understand this strange man

626
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,080
and he’s not a free soul,” and how is he in Bible?

627
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,040
When I first saw the Bible I was surprised. I said, “How is he here?

628
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,080
Who is he? I have never known him.” That’s what it is

629
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,240
but we get enamored by his organizing capacity,

630
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,400
the way he’s organized everything. You cannot organize God, can you?

631
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,040
How can you organize God? Nobody should feel shattered because

632
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,120
they are saying they were not miracles and they were allegories.

633
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,320
You will meet so many miracles as soon as you will become the Spirit.

634
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,320
God is full of miracles.

635
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,120
Every miracle that is described of Christ is true.

636
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:34,000
It was an immaculate conception. And we have His previous life,

637
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,280
we know how He was created on this earth through complete

638
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,080
immaculate conception by a virgin and everything we know about it

639
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,240
in India and Indians are shocked how could you accept such a nonsense

640
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,200
from people who are just intellectuals, they’re not realized souls.

641
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:55,240
Thank God in India even today people know what is a realized soul is.

642
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,200
Even the president, he would not sit down when I went to see him.

643
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,080
He would not sit down, I said, “Sir, I’m your citizen,” he said,

644
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,080
“No, Mother you’re a saint.” And he sat on the ground,

645
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,320
he wouldn’t sit with Me on the same couch which he was having.

646
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,080
That’s what it is. Our sensitivity in the West is gone down

647
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,080
because of intellectualism. Even the science is a barrier,

648
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,400
all these things are barriers, you see, and this barrier we must

649
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,320
understand we have to become the same innocent person

650
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,240
as Christ has said that you have to become children

651
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,480
to enter into the kingdom of God. And this happens to you

652
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,320
as soon as the Kundalini rises you become innocent,

653
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,080
you become an innocent person. Innocent doesn’t mean a fool,

654
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,520
innocent is the most intelligent, is the most powerful person.

655
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,440
And a person who is a realized soul is also not a compromising person,

656
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,240
“All right, if the churches are not working

657
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,120
let us have a discotheque here.”

658
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,120
That’s not possible, how can you have discotheque?

659
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,320
Like in India in the temples they are selling all these drugs,

660
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,320
can you imagine? Everywhere in all the religions they’re doing this

661
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,520
compromising with the truth. Because they have no power;

662
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,240
if you have the spiritual power you’ll not compromise with anyone.

663
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,320
See the life of Christ.

664
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,560
He took one hunter and started hitting all the people who were

665
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,080
sitting outside and selling things outside the temple.

666
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,560
It was He who stood against the people who were trying

667
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,320
to throw stones at a prostitute and challenging because He knew

668
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,480
that everybody was sinful and nobody had right to judge others.

669
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,320
It was His power that made Him stand against all of them.

670
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,160
I would say anyone of these who talk against Christ like this

671
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,440
should stand up and say it. Have they got courage?

672
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,400
They have no courage and that’s why I say they are not free people,

673
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,000
they’re bound.

674
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,080
If you want to attract people this is not the way to attract,

675
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,280
through unreal thinking and mental projection.

676
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,280
But by giving them their realization, their property, what they have.

677
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,320
They don’t want to accept it because they think they’ll be challenged.

678
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,320
They all can get realization themselves but they will not come forward.

679
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,320
So don’t believe when they say that there were no miracles of Christ.

680
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,280
Without miracles how are we created; ourselves we are miraculous.

681
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,280
Think of ourselves; we are made like a computer which doesn’t think,

682
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,080
it doesn’t need any programming. When you are seeing Me,

683
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,320
you are seeing Me, you don’t have to think about it, isn’t it?

684
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,280
What a great computer we are made. Can they make even a flower?

685
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,560
What are they talking of intellectualizing and the miracles of miracles

686
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,360
that are so many, how we are channelized, how we are born,

687
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,080
how out of thousands of genes, one gene is used for the eyes,

688
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,320
one for the nose, how they develop into a particular thing.

689
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,560
Just look at the miracle of the whole universe,

690
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:56,040
we don’t want to see that because we are becoming egoistical about it.

691
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,320
We think that we can manage God, we can organize Him,

692
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,280
we can do whatever we like. In the same realm, when we start seeing

693
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,000
the horrible people coming from India and looting you,

694
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,480
we succumb to them because they pamper your ego. They say,

695
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,440
“All right, you can pay for me” “Oh, we can buy him, he’s for sale.”

696
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,240
And now, I was surprised among the elite societies, it’s very funny

697
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:26,160
but it’s true, they discuss, “I think this guru is three pounds less,”

698
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,400
or, “That guru you can say five pounds,” it’s a big discussion on.

699
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,480
It’s a guru-shopping going on, you see.

700
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,240
I’ve been talking against them for the last twelve years

701
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,240
openly taking their names and blasting them.

702
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,040
About this Scientology, I told them in Brighton two years back

703
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,480
and now they’ve found out about this Scientology.

704
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,440
So the Brighton radio was very kind to Me and they called Me.

705
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,360
I said, “When I told you, you were the ones who blasted Me,

706
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,160
then why should you say this against Scientology?”

707
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,560
Anybody who takes money from you in the name of God,

708
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,400
know that he is a devil. No one should take any money

709
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,280
in the name of God. All right you have to have the hall,

710
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,440
you pay for the hall not for God. If your climate was all right,

711
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,040
we could have done it outside but paying for the hall

712
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:19,320
is different from paying for God. And the way these people have

713
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,480
minted money is your naiveness, your stupidity, I should say

714
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,080
that you didn’t understand this simple thing that these people are

715
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,480
buying lots of aero planes and Rolls-Royces and you’re paying for it.

716
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,440
Still I must say, English are wiser than many others.

717
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,160
Like in America, I went and they told Me,

718
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,080
“How many Rolls-Royces she has?”

719
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,440
They said, “She has no Rolls Royce,

720
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,480
She doesn’t take any money,” so they said, “We are not interested.”

721
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,080
It’s a pop show going on, you see, how much money you make

722
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,280
in this guru business.

723
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,360
If somebody is a smart one, if he has made a big money,

724
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,480
“Oh, he’s a smart fellow, he’s made so much money.”

725
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,480
Can you imagine how money-oriented they are?

726
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,000
You’re not, you are much better. So keep to your styles and I’m sure

727
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,040
British will one day teach all of them a proper thing which is

728
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,560
called is the proper balanced spiritual life.

729
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,080
Somehow in this lifetime I have learned English language,

730
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,280
I’m not so good but I can speak English and you should not mind

731
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,480
if I have made any mistakes in English language. But one thing

732
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,480
is there that English is much better than many other foreign languages

733
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,080
because I find there is no word for awareness in French,

734
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,280
how to translate awareness. There’s no word for conscience,

735
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,440
there’s no word for consciousness, there’s only one ‘conscia’,

736
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,520
whatever you call it. Of course English also has little problems.

737
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,320
Like for spirit, you call the spirit that is dead the spirit,

738
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:45,560
then you call the spirit that you get in the pubs also the spirit

739
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,080
and also you call the spirit, that’s the pure thing within yourself,

740
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,240
the reflection of God as spirit, and also the Holy Ghost as the Spirit.

741
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,240
But in Sanskrit language, because it deals more, more with the roots

742
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,120
it has more words for all these things.

743
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:10,040
But it may not have so many words for the use of the, say,

744
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,280
a glass and the tumbler for this kind of a wine and that,

745
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,280
that it may not have anything about it, it’s a general thing,

746
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:22,320
what we call as one word for the whole. All pubs are one word

747
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,240
and all alcohols and everything is one word.

748
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,560
There’s no differentiation at all because they do not know this area

749
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,480
but the area they know, for that, they have different words.

750
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,240
And that’s why sometimes one has to take to Sanskrit language

751
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,240
in a way to understand. But you need not worry because we can do it

752
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,120
in English language also very well now, it’s very simple.

753
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:50,080
Now the happening takes place and then you become empowered

754
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,480
and then you should only learn to maneuver it.

755
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,080
So the yoga has two meanings, the first one means

756
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,400
the union with the Divine,

757
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,240
it is ‘sahaja’ meaning spontaneous because in the modern times

758
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,480
there are all kinds of yogas. So it is a spontaneous, living yoga

759
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,320
and that’s the only one is the real yoga, the rest is all

760
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,520
something like an exercise. And the second part of the yoga means

761
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,240
that the deftness to know the art of handling this power.

762
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,280
That’s why they said when they got their realization or

763
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,480
when they got the blessings of the Holy Spirit they started moving

764
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,240
their hands in such a way that people thought that they were mad,

765
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,280
but the whole of namaz itself is awakening of the Kundalini,

766
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,080
the whole of namaz is. And the way we move our hands, you see,

767
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,320
the power moves through our hands. So the movement of our hands

768
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,400
gives us the empowering and we know how to handle this power

769
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,480
within ourselves so you become your own guru.

770
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,560
Now as I’m here for the first time I would like you to ask Me questions

771
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:56,040
about Sahaja Yoga, about anything but still I would say you need not

772
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,280
be aggressive with Me because it’s not good and don’t waste the energy

773
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,480
of other people because there are many people who are seekers here

774
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,480
I can see very clearly writ large on their faces,

775
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,240
they’re real seekers of ages and let them have their seeking.

776
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,480
Now if you have any such questions which you want to ask

777
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,480
you can ask Me because in a short lecture like this,

778
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,360
in one visit what could I do, how much could I tell you?

779
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,280
I must have given at least two thousand lectures in English language

780
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,320
and they are all on the tapes and later on you can get them

781
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,080
and listen to them, the nature of the Spirit,

782
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,200
what it means to be realized,

783
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:40,000
how we become the citizens of God’s kingdom, what is God’s kingdom

784
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,080
within us, where are these chakras placed, everything I’ve told

785
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,400
and everything is to be told to you. There are some books also

786
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,600
we have written but we don’t give books in the beginning

787
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
because again, you see, the brain starts thinking about it.

788
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,600
You have to be in thoughtless awareness, so there only you grow.

789
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,360
So we don’t want you to give some food for thought all the time

790
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,640
so that you are all on a thinking level but you should grow

791
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,280
and that’s why one has to understand

792
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,320
that this lecture is not sufficient enough

793
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,640
but is just an introduction to Sahaja Yoga.

794
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,200
It was suddenly decided that I have to come here to Middlesbrough

795
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,680
and this gentleman rang Me up and I found him very positive.

796
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:22,320
It was very great, you see, and I think people are little in a puzzle

797
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,400
these days because the way everything is attacked.

798
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:33,240
And I think in a way it’s good because that will give them a curiosity

799
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,120
to ascend. May God bless you all.

800
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,600
I would like to have some questions from you.

801
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:53,160
(Warren: Any questions? Very soon Shri Mataji will give you the experience

802
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,080
and you can begin to feel what She’s speaking of.)

803
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:00,120
I shouldn’t say I will give you because you’ll get it.

804
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,080
It’s like the sun shining saying, “I’m shining,”

805
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,000
I mean it has to shine jolly well, that’s its nature,

806
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,040
and we have to get the sunshine, jolly well.

807
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,520
It just works spontaneously.

808
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,440
(Question: You gave this yoga a particular name,

809
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,240
how many types of yoga do you have?)

810
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,320
I don’t know, as many brains there are in this world,

811
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,680
but there’s only one yoga, is Sahaja.

812
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,360
If you read the Patanjali Yoga from which this so-called yoga has come,

813
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,480
has got ahstangas eight folds, out of which a wee bit

814
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,480
is called as yamanyama, in that a wee bit is the exercises.

815
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,360
But these exercises are of no use without the Kundalini awakening.

816
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,080
It’s written very clearly but nobody reads that big book, you see.

817
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,560
Somebody has read only the beginning of it

818
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,080
and has started calling it yoga.

819
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,400
Now you have to make the Kundalini start

820
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,480
and then you know where the problem is,

821
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,160
for example, you have a problem in the stomach

822
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,600
and if you are doing the exercise of the neck what’s the use.

823
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,280
But the way people do sometimes it frightens Me;

824
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,000
they want to take out the whole of their intestines outside,

825
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,520
the way they are at it, it’s too much. There’s no need to do all that

826
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,480
because that will really give you a heart attack or something like that.

827
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,200
It gives Me a terrible fright;

828
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:36,240
yoga doesn’t mean exercise by any chance, it means giving relief

829
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:40,080
to a particular center which is obstructed, and how to do it,

830
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:44,400
we also do exercises whenever it is needed to a particular thing

831
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,320
but it’s very simple one, once in a while. It’s not like madness all the time,

832
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,200
even people who do yoga I’ve seen,

833
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,480
they cannot sit for one minute straight, you see.

834
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:58,040
They just go into all these tantrums, it’s very difficult to understand.

835
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,600
You become very normal, decent people.

836
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,360
So the other yogas I don't know what they are all like,

837
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,240
Kundalini yoga you can call it, is the Kundalini yoga

838
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,560
if you want elaborately say it, Kundalini Yoga,

839
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,480
it's Sahaja Yoga or you can call it Yoga itself.

840
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,240
But I have called it Sahaja is not the point

841
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,400
is a word very ancient Sahaja Saha-ja,

842
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:27,080
'Saha' means with, 'ja' means born, it's born with you

843
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,280
Like every seed can become a tree, it is born with you,

844
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,440
you all can become that tree of life.

845
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,560
I could have said yoga, but it means nothing

846
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,280
I have seen people who were taking some drugs and

847
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,440
I said, "What are you doing?" They said, "We are doing drug yoga."

848
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,400
Everything is a yoga these days, you don't know.

849
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:59,120
Coca-Cola yoga, all kinds of yoga.

850
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,280
Yes, I tell you it is. Human beings are really ingenious,

851
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,560
the way they manage everything. They know how to mess up everything.

852
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,560
(Question: There are many interpretations of the Bible,

853
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,400
how do you know that your interpretation is the correct one?)

854
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,600
Because it can be proved,

855
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,280
it can be proved - you see the interpretations that

856
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,600
come out of brains will be many -

857
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,640
because it can be proved, you see now for example I say Christ resides

858
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,640
on a center called as Agnya chakra

859
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,440
which is placed on the optic chiasma

860
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,240
which is controlling your pituitary and the pineal body,

861
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:58,320
supposing I say that, all right? Now you keep your mind open about it.

862
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,040
Now when I raise the Kundalini

863
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,320
I find that it is stuck here.

864
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,440
This is the window; this is the window of Christ.

865
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,200
This is the blood of Christ, symbolic of His blood which protects you.

866
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,680
Now this is the window of Christ.

867
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,480
Now when I say that, this interpretation,

868
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,000
that when the Kundalini is rising, it stops there.

869
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,440
I have to take His name, request Him

870
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,560
or I have to say Lord's Prayer.

871
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,600
That's the mantra, that's the chanting one has to do, then it rises.

872
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:40,320
He sucks in your ego and superego and you can see it clearly

873
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,520
happening that here on the fontanel bone area, you get a soft bone

874
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,480
and you see the cool breeze coming out of it.

875
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,320
Now, you ask a question, putting your hands like this,

876
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,560
ask a question, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

877
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,640
The vibrations start flowing much more.

878
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:08,440
Supposing you ask about somebody who is not a good man

879
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,200
the burning may start coming on your fingers.

880
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,400
Now supposing you say there is no God,

881
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,080
you may get a terrible burning on your hands.

882
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,400
So relatively you understand that whenever you ask for something

883
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,480
truthful you get lot of vibrations.

884
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,160
That means your computer has started working

885
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:34,720
but for anything you find out whether it is true or not

886
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,400
you have to work it out and see for yourself.

887
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,200
Now when it happens with this if you get cured automatically,

888
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:47,440
if you become a joyous personality, if you get completely transformed

889
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,440
and you start curing others and you know all about it,

890
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,720
you become knowledgeable about it. It’s not that

891
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,280
you start shaking before someone and then the person gets…,

892
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:02,080
you are quite normal and not only that you cure

893
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,360
but you make another person so peaceful and joyful

894
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:10,440
and enlighten that person that that person can himself give realization.

895
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,720
You can see the Kundalini, the one that is in the triangular bone

896
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,800
just like a heart pulsating in some people, not all,

897
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,680
if there’s an obstruction in the higher chakra

898
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,360
then you see it actually like that. We have got pictures of that.

899
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,600
So whatever interpretation you give mentally is not true,

900
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:34,760
you must prove it. So you have to accept it as a hypothesis.

901
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,040
As in any science you give a hypothesis first

902
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,520
and then try to prove it.

903
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,480
If you have proved it then you have to accept it as a law

904
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:49,080
otherwise you are dishonest. If you’re honest,

905
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,120
really if you’re honest you have to accept it, isn’t it?

906
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,000
That’s what My husband told Me that, “I cannot be anymore

907
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,360
dishonest about it, I have to accept it, that’s the truth.”

908
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,720
All right, now what’s the other question?

909
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,760
(Warren: She’s heard and read that if you awaken Kundalini

910
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,480
before it’s ready it can be dangerous.)

911
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,560
Yes, must be, because the people who raise have no authority to do it;

912
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,800
they don’t know how to do it. A person who is not a doctor

913
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,720
if he tries to operate, what will happen? It’s dangerous.

914
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,440
So far so many people their Kundalini has been awakened.

915
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,080
I haven’t seen any dangerous things happen to anyone,

916
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,280
on the contrary everybody has gained by it.

917
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,480
The reason is you should know how to do it, you should be

918
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:43,320
an authority to do it. Supposing you put one seed in the steel box,

919
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,080
will it grow? No, you have to put it in the Mother Earth,

920
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,080
she has the capacity to do it. In the same way the one who knows

921
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,360
can do it, has to be an authority on it, and it is your Mother,

922
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,000
She is your Mother. Everyone has an individual mother

923
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,400
waiting to give that self-realization, how can She be unkind to you?

924
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,680
Of course, in the beginning little heat is thrown out of your body

925
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,480
because you’re heated up. It’s all right, doesn’t matter,

926
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,560
it’s not so much and sometimes you do feel little shaking

927
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,120
if you have been to a wrong type of a guru or something

928
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,040
or if you are suffering from nervous trouble

929
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,800
there’s a little shaking that's all.

930
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,560
I have not seen anything wrong happening

931
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,480
but like one gentleman came and sat on the ground. I said,

932
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,400
“Why are you sitting on the ground like that with your feet towards me?”

933
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,080
He said, “You know Mother, my Kundalini has been awakened

934
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,280
and I’m jumping like a frog.” I said, “Why are you jumping like a frog?”

935
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,280
He said, “My guru has said it and he wrote it down on a book

936
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,000
that you jump like a frog.” I said, “Now are you going to become a frog

937
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:50,040
or an earthworm?” Use your brains, all right?

938
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,200
Nothing to be afraid of.

939
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,480
I don’t think I look that frightful, do I?

940
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,320
(Warren: If there are no more questions we’ll have the experience.)

941
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,520
No, one more, yes let’s have it.

942
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,160
Yes, please!

943
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,000
It's a very long question.

944
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:16,120
(Warren: First of all, she says that she agrees with everything

945
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,160
that You’ve said, but she’s concerned about one thing,

946
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:26,480
as she herself is a spiritualist medium, she is aware of the dangers

947
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,120
and she wonders whether You are able to distinguish

948
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,280
between the dangers and the blessings.)

949
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:38,760
Absolutely, that’s what it is, that you should know what are the dangers.

950
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,480
I’ve already told you, moving to the left and the right

951
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,760
and the spiritualists are moving to the left.

952
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,200
They’re using spirits and it’s very dangerous. You don’t know how

953
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,320
to protect yourself, unless and until you get your realization

954
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,320
you will not even know how spiritualism is wrong;

955
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,800
absolutely it is most dangerous.

956
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,440
There is no danger in Kundalini, but in spiritualism

957
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:06,080
it’s most dangerous, whether you may be all right for the short time

958
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,760
but they are spirits, you must know

959
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:13,360
and spirits are the most dangerous things. Don’t go near them.

960
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,480
It’s very surprising that in the West,

961
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,480
people have no idea about spirits

962
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:22,080
and the way they go headlong into it, it sometimes really upsets Me.

963
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:26,400
In India people know about it, they call it Bhootavidya, Pretavidya,

964
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,600
Smashanavidya, means the knowledge about the dead, we can say,

965
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,720
in small the dead knowledge and they just don’t want to go near it.

966
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:39,240
Say, the other day we had a visitor and I took her to a church

967
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,720
and she was holding her sari, going like this. I said,

968
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,720
“What’s the problem?” She said, “All dead are here,

969
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:48,600
how can we cross over them?” She couldn’t understand

970
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,080
and we have them in the churches where children go.

971
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,160
It’s very dangerous. Only the realized people in India are buried,

972
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:01,000
only realized souls are buried, not the people who are not realized.

973
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,440
They’re not to be buried; they’re to be burned so that their body

974
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,240
gets purified and again they come on this earth for their realization.

975
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,360
And the dead in the church! It’s so dangerous,

976
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,680
playing with spiritualists, nobody will do.

977
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:18,200
Here I find housewives, and all people responsible

978
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,760
getting into this mess of spiritualism.

979
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:25,000
It’s all absolutely against Sahaja Yoga.

980
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,680
We have nothing to do with them. On the contrary they suffer a lot.

981
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,160
Spiritualists suffer a lot later on in life.

982
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,280
Not only but seven generations of their family can suffer.

983
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,080
We had a doctor here who came and I was surprised that

984
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,040
he being a doctor was suffering from this kind of a disease.

985
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:46,680
He was a Russian doctor and I asked him, “How did you get into it?”

986
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:51,160
So he told me his mother, his grandmother had a hobby to take him

987
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,480
to the cemetery. From his childhood he used to go to the cemetery.

988
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,800
We could not locate the problem anywhere, he was very depressed

989
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:02,320
and he used to get into problems and he had to give up his jobs.

990
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,360
Now then we met another Indian doctor who was here

991
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:10,120
and he had the same type of trouble, he’d given up his job and

992
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,200
his wife didn’t know what to do and his children were also suffering.

993
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,720
So I asked him a question, “Why, why you are like this?

994
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,640
What did you do with your studies?” And he was quite normal.

995
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,640
He said, “I led a very normal life.” But his grandfather used to do

996
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,680
black magic, in the sense we call it, all this is black magic.

997
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:31,200
All spiritualism is black magic, because it has to deal with the dead.

998
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,280
And this boy was suffering, his children were suffering.

999
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,080
Now we have one person from Guyana,

1000
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,360
another one from Guyana,

1001
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:53,400
he too, his father used to do this kind of a thing and he is suffering,

1002
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,680
he’s still suffering. He’s come to Sahaja Yoga and he’s still…

1003
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,120
but he can see now and he knows how to protect.

1004
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:05,480
So those who deal with dead are going to suffer, take it from me,

1005
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,720
whatever you may do, because they’re just like human beings

1006
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,720
and sometimes slyer people than we are.

1007
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,040
We should have nothing to do with the dead.

1008
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,600
Let them take their birth again, let them take their realization.

1009
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,600
All anorexia, all these diseases come out of that.

1010
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,120
So many diseases I’ve told you, cancer is caused by the dead.

1011
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,200
Be careful on that point and I don’t understand

1012
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,200
all educated people here, so much developed,

1013
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,600
how can you take…, Indians won’t take to it.

1014
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,760
They won’t go near it; they understand.

1015
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,200
Tantrikas and all that are prevalent only in very poor countries

1016
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:45,240
like… say, it’s a vicious circle, it brings poverty also. As soon as

1017
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,800
there is a dead in a family or a dead work done, the money disappears.

1018
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:53,440
The reason is the goddess of Lakshmi as we call them,

1019
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:57,000
she just disappears, she doesn’t like that black thing at all.

1020
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,800
And so the countries where we have, I mean, in our country

1021
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,080
the provinces which are poor, the whole country is not poor,

1022
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:09,480
they’re doing all black magic. In Kerala, it’s very poor country,

1023
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,720
I went there, they bury their dead in the house.

1024
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,720
It is all that. You must keep them out,

1025
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:20,800
because the goddess of wealth doesn’t like it.

1026
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,080
All this knowledge was not known to you but that doesn’t mean

1027
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,560
that you should go headlong into these things, it’s very, very dangerous.

1028
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,760
Never go near the dead; whatever it is the planet said,

1029
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,520
this, that, it’s all nonsensical.

1030
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,360
There’s no need to do that. But people are really…,

1031
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,080
I don’t understand, they’re daredevils.

1032
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,400
Like from America three big scientists came to see me,

1033
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:49,160
in India I’m very well-known. So they came to see me and said that,

1034
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,280
“Mother, teach us how to fly in the air.” I said,

1035
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:54,320
“Why do you want to fly in the air? What is the need?”

1036
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,400
“No, we want to leave our body and go to the moon.” I said,

1037
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,200
“You are already doing it with your body, why do you want to do it?”

1038
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:06,720
So they told me that, “Parapsychology is practiced now in Russia

1039
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,520
and we want to do the same.” I said, “It will affect them.”

1040
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:15,360
You see the way their presidents are killed, this is all parapsychology.

1041
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:19,080
I told them, “Don’t go near them.” They said, “No Mother,

1042
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:23,600
we want to do it.” I said, “But then you will be slaves of these dead,

1043
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,760
would you like to do that?” Still they said, “Yes we want to do it.”

1044
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,280
I said, “I have nothing to do but who has told you about this?”

1045
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:34,520
They said, “There is one fellow, Patanjali, who is a reporter.”

1046
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:38,600
I said, “Look at this Patanjali, he was suffering from this trouble,

1047
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:43,560
that his body used to be left behind and he would fly out and do…”

1048
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,680
And he came and his wife came and begged of me that

1049
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,440
they should be rid of this trouble and he’s telling them that

1050
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,200
am I going to put the trouble into them?

1051
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,000
All this parapsychology business, when I went first to America

1052
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,760
I must tell you, this experience is very good.

1053
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,480
I told them against parapsychology openly because they,

1054
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,560
I didn’t know what they were doing in parapsychology, first of all,

1055
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,760
and they are the people who invited me in their hall. I blasted them

1056
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,720
and I said, “Don’t do all this nonsense, it will all destroy you,

1057
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,520
just don’t go near them.”

1058
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:19,360
Second time when I went to America, only last year,

1059
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,520
I was giving on the television, I was on the television

1060
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:26,800
and before the television they had told that Mataji Nirmala Devi

1061
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:32,240
is going to come. And somebody telephoned from San Diego saying that,

1062
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,600
“Mother had come last time and she told us about parapsychology

1063
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:39,360
and she told us about the gurus, she warned us but we never listened

1064
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:44,480
to her and now we are destroyed people. Can she save us?” I said,

1065
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:49,280
“Yes, but still it’s difficult now, you should not have gone to that.”

1066
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:53,800
And the whole of that parapsychology thing is finished now.

1067
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:58,160
The building caught fire, the gentleman went to Australia,

1068
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:04,720
he got a funny temperament, he ended up in a lunatic asylum.

1069
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:10,320
The wife, she became paralytic, she ended up in a lunatic asylum.

1070
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:16,000
Brezhnev and all these people, they all suffered from this.

1071
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:19,520
You can see their faces, all like this, possessed.

1072
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,080
Don’t go near the spiritualists;

1073
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,680
don’t do that, it’s very dangerous, for you,

1074
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,480
for the progeny, for everyone. I must warn you;

1075
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:32,480
it’s the most dangerous thing and should not do that.

1076
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,120
Even if you don’t like it, I have to tell you.

1077
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,080
I don’t want to tell you something that’s not true.

1078
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:44,200
You depend on yourself, on your own Spirit, on your own being.

1079
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:48,040
Why to depend on somebody who’s dead, let them be alone.

1080
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,400
But when they suffer, they come to me, I’ve seen it,

1081
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,120
when they suffer then they come.

1082
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,400
Then it’s so difficult, you see, afterwards to give them

1083
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,160
realization, it’s so difficult, they’ve already harmed themselves.

1084
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:13,720
He (Warren) also had gone to someone like that, but his wife we lost

1085
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:17,600
because she was going too much of it; we’ve lost her, she’s…,

1086
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:22,080
I don’t know, she may come back, but I mean, she’s very much attacked,

1087
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:26,080
very much attacked. And she used to become like a furious personality

1088
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:30,400
and all sorts of things used to happen to her and I hope she comes back

1089
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,080
but it’s very difficult, you know, to pull them back out of the clutches

1090
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,480
of that, because they don’t know what they’re are doing,

1091
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,320
what they’re talking, how they’re behaving.

1092
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:45,040
A sickness of the worst type. Even AIDS is a sickness from the same.

1093
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,720
Most of the terminal diseases come from them.

1094
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,040
It’s very dangerous, don’t go near them.

1095
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:56,480
Christ has already told you; he’s the one who told so plainly,

1096
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,680
he took them out and put them in the pigs and pigs went into the sea.

1097
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,760
You have heard of that or not;

1098
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:06,520
so why do you want to bring them back? Put them in the pigs.

1099
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:12,480
If they don’t want to reside in the area where they are supposed

1100
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,920
to reside, let them go to pigs.

1101
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,360
They’ve no business… they’re busybodies, you know.

1102
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:20,720
There’re also one Dr. Lang in here. I must tell them about him,

1103
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:26,880
this Dr. Lang, late Dr. Lang, dead. And he capsized a man

1104
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:30,200
in Vietnam who was a soldier who was under a shock

1105
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,400
and this soldier came down to London

1106
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,720
to see his son and he said, “I’m Dr. Lang.”

1107
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:40,840
The son was shocked, he said, “Who? How are you… my father is dead.”

1108
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:44,240
He said, “No, your father has possessed me, and he has told me

1109
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,840
that I must start my clinic here and there are many doctors

1110
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,680
who want to help me and I’m going to start this clinic.”

1111
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:57,440
So the son listened to it and he said, “How am I to believe

1112
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,920
that you are my father?” Then he told him some secrets

1113
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,320
which were between the two, and told about the house

1114
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,840
where he had put some money and all that.

1115
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,280
And the son was surprised and he started the clinic;

1116
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,800
and that’s how the International Curative Centre of Late Dr. Lang

1117
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:19,320
started in London. How I came to know about it, that in 1974

1118
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,520
I met a lady, she was shaking all the time like this.

1119
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,200
I said, “What’s this?”

1120
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:27,000
She said, “Mother, I don’t know but I was cured by Dr. Lang,

1121
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:30,760
late Dr. Lang.” Then she told me the story. But they were honest

1122
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,160
to tell about this whole thing what had happened but he did not enter

1123
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,760
into the body of the boy, his son, entered into somebody else

1124
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,640
who was a very healthy man. And she told me that,

1125
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,120
“When I wrote to them, I am suffering from these troubles,

1126
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:47,880
stomach trouble, they told me that you will have the experience

1127
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:52,040
at such and such exact this time.” That shows it’s not living

1128
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,800
because you cannot give time to something that is living. You cannot

1129
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:00,240
say exactly what time a flower is going to become the fruit, can you?

1130
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:04,320
And this thing entered into her body, she started shaking, shaking,

1131
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,520
and her stomach was all right.

1132
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,520
For about two years she was all right, afterwards the whole body

1133
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,880
started shaking, she became like a mad woman.

1134
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,600
She used to run out of the house and people would say that,

1135
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:20,240
“This woman is going to kill herself.” Once she jumped from

1136
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:23,760
a very high ceiling just to kill herself but somehow she was saved,

1137
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:29,160
and they brought her to Me and she told me the story of late Dr. Lang.

1138
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,480
So I have to tell you, though they cure you for a while,

1139
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:38,240
don’t go near them, better you cure yourself and know all about it.

1140
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,800
You be the master of yourself.

1141
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:45,080
It’s nice she brought out the point because otherwise…

1142
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:50,920
it’s all Sahaj, it’s spontaneous, so that I could tell you about it;

1143
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:55,400
it’s quite possible that people could take to that.

1144
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,600
Now should we have the experience now, all of us?
