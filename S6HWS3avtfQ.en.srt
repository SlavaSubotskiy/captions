1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,029
I'm really sorry for getting so late...It
happens and whatever happens one has to accept.

2
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:14,029
That's how the Divine works. Everything has
some reasons. Now, they must been able to

3
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:31,340
explain to you what centers we have within
ourselves and he has told you 
what is the mechanism within ourselves. It

4
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,120
is all built within us during the different
periods of our evolution. Every center is

5
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:59,630
built like that.

6
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:06,630
Now, all this is built, like a pathway. By
left and right you create the central path

7
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:21,310
of your ascent. And when this pure energy
of your desire ascends, is awakened, then

8
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:36,319
it pierces through the last center what we
call as Sahasrara, meaning the thousand petalled

9
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:51,770
centre, which is the brain, we can say, or
part of the brain which covers the limbic

10
00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:01,229
area. The Spirit is the reflection of God
Almighty and it resides in our heart. When

11
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:24,080
the Kundalini touches the Sahastrara, the
seat of the Spirit, which is reflected in

12
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:35,120
the heart, gets enlightened. That doesn't
mean the Spirit gets enlightened but the attention

13
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:45,700
is like a sari, which is pushed in like this,
[AND] when it touches, it pierces through

14
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:52,700
and the Spirit in the heart, which has the
seat here, starts entering into our central

15
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,120
nervous system.

16
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:09,120
So the first feeling you get is a cool breeze
on top of your head. That's the first feeling.

17
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:18,210
Second feeling you get is All Pervading Power
because now you have entered into the subtle

18
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:27,600
area of your awareness. Human awareness is
gross first but when you touch the Spirit,

19
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:37,180
you become thoughtlessly aware but there is
no thought, the grossness goes away because

20
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:47,310
thoughts disappear. And you become subtler.
This subtleness gives you certain powers.

21
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,480
The first power that you get is that you become,
your awareness becomes collectively conscious.

22
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,640
That you can feel another person on your fingertips
- that means you become absolutely aware.

23
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:20,990
Like I went today to Mexico and I could feel
the whole country, I knew about it before

24
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,800
but my attention was not so deeply there.
I could feel the whole country has a very

25
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:39,050
bad left side problem and the left side problem
is affecting even this area and the left side

26
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:49,449
problem you can feel it very clearly that
your left side becomes heavy and you feel

27
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:56,449
the heat in all your centers. So you start
feeling the atmosphere, the country, the people

28
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:11,539
and individual and yourself. So you know the
problem of a particular place. I mean you

29
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:21,310
may not feel that much in the beginning, you
may just feel yourself to begin with.

30
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:28,310
Then you start feeling others, so thus the
awareness grows more and more. In the central

31
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:39,150
nervous system you start feeling the problems
of other people, your own problems. But it

32
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:51,699
is not that you feel them as something, which
is painful or troublesome, but you feel them

33
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:59,289
as little heat or sometimes little pain, very
little, as if you are recording it like a

34
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:11,219
barometer. And when that happens you want
to get rid of it as if they are your own problem,

35
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:19,860
and if you know how to get rid of it you can
do it. That's what I was doing and that's

36
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,860
how I'm late, something on the collective.
If you are working on something you want to

37
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:35,999
finish the job and then you want to attend
to another. Don't want to leave something

38
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:42,360
half done.

39
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:49,360
For human beings it is difficult in the beginning,
because from human awareness you are rising

40
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:57,870
to super human awareness or you can call it
to super awareness, into a subtler awareness.

41
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:06,120
So first the awareness is gross and then your
awareness becomes subtler. But with that you

42
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:15,689
do not fell in any way uncomfortable or upset,
because you become extremely powerful. Such

43
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:27,080
power of compassion, that you don't feel anything,
no pain, no problems, the illusions disappear

44
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:36,599
completely. There's no more illusion in the
mind.

45
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:43,599
Like people say that when you face something
you are filled with the greed, or greed or

46
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:55,150
lust. But when your eyes become pure, there
is no greed or lust. But what happens that

47
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:05,229
you start feeling the oneness with another
thing, whatever it is, in a way that it is

48
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:18,430
joy giving. Like you see someone, an attractive
person, there is no sensation of [BERSERK]

49
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,680
feelings for that person but the sensation
just disappears and you start feeling the

50
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:39,539
joy of the creation of that person or the
thing.

51
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:48,660
Like in Mexico, people have made so many things
with hand. If you watch them you might think

52
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:55,660
how much it will cost, what will be the price,
who has made it. But if there is no thought

53
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:05,730
then you see something, which looks very joyous,
because you can feel the vibrations. And you

54
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:14,720
know somebody has made it, who might have
been a Realized soul, who might have been

55
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,720
a very great devotee of God, might have been
a person who must have thought that: "This

56
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:31,250
is your creation, oh God." Such a person might
have made with that feeling which is to be

57
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,550
gratified and you feel that we should take
it. The matter has only one capacity that

58
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:46,040
it gives joy in giving to others, so that
you can express your happiness into it. So

59
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,690
you become very subtly aware of the matter,
that you start understanding the matter, what

60
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,910
it means and what is the use of a particular
thing.

61
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:04,910
In the same way, when you meet people, new
people, absolutely never known, you know what

62
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:13,040
are their needs, what problems they have,
on a wider scale, on a collective scale, and

63
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:20,370
also you know one simple thing that there
are people in Mexico, who are seeking God,

64
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:34,490
who are to be helped, who are to be given
something that they want. They may not be

65
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:41,490
so much aware of it but we become aware of
them. And a kind of a rapport of a very subtle

66
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:50,250
type is established and you get attracted
towards other people not through any lust

67
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:58,139
or greed or any purpose but in oneness with
the joy that they have within themselves,

68
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:09,449
the joy of the Spirit. You look at them and
you feel: "This person is such a wonderful

69
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,480
person". How do you know? You start feeling
the cool vibrations in your hand from that

70
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:29,380
person. And you just enjoy that person for
that person's sake, not for anything, whether

71
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:36,380
poor, rich, good looking, bad looking, doesn't
matter. You approach the Spirit of another

72
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,290
person because you have become the Spirit.

73
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:47,290
People talk of big things, of organizing peace
missions, this mission, that mission, to create

74
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:55,940
a better relationship. All relationships,
which are at a gross level create problems,

75
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:04,449
because there is some sort of a lurking selfishness
behind it. But once it becomes the spiritual

76
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:12,079
relationship you just enjoy the other person
without getting into any discussion about

77
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,360
what is your gain, what is you are going to
achieve through going nearer to that personality.

78
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:30,759
Thus you become the receiver of the joy. Like
a lake, which is ripleless, which is absolutely

79
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:44,300
quiet and looks like a mirror. It reflects
all that is created round it completely and

80
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:55,360
emits complete joy of the creation.

81
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,360
In the same way the heart, which is filled
with the light of the Spirit, reflects the

82
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:10,709
complete joy of the creation of another person.
Whatever it has in a subtle way you enjoyed.

83
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:23,540
Then the time, you don't see, you go beyond
time, you go beyond time, you are not bothered

84
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:36,660
about time. Everything has got a proper timing
and you start understanding that this is the

85
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:45,600
time it was to be. You don't become a slave
of time, you don't become slave of any habits,

86
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:54,649
you don't become slave of any temptations,
but you enjoy the complete freedom of enjoying

87
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,959
the joy.

88
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:10,959
For example we are very tight thinking what
is to be done next, what this has to be, but

89
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:22,519
then you start seeing the purpose of your
life. Like one day we had to have a Puja or

90
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:33,129
a kind of a worship. They said: "We'll start
at about 9 o'clock" as it is today something

91
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:41,639
happened. And I said: "Alright, we'll start
at 9.00." But I knew 9.00 was not all right

92
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:48,529
so I reached the place at 11.00. Of course
those who had to stay, would've stayed on.

93
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:55,529
Because you need people who understand that
time has no meaning when it is the Spirit.

94
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:03,800
And I said: "Now, just see the Panchanga,
that book which we consult for timing." They

95
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:10,800
said: "Today is the dark night Damasya." "And
when does it end?" "Just now." I said: "That's

96
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:19,110
it." So everything, the timing, everything
has to be worked out according to the need

97
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:27,060
of the Spirit and not need of the gross. When
that happens you [GO or KNOW] smoothly and

98
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:37,589
understandingly the whole pattern of the Divine
how it works out. And that is how you understand

99
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:48,339
the dynamism of time, because you live in
the present not in the future or in the past.

100
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:58,120
Actually the past doesn't exist and future
has not come, we don't know what future is.

101
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:05,009
To come in the present you have to be the
Spirit. And when you are in the Spirit then

102
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:12,009
you realize that this present is the reality,
the rest is a myth. When the Kundalini rises

103
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:22,129
She passes attention into an area or She penetrates
into an area where there is silence because

104
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:35,029
a thought rises and falls off, another thought
rises and falls off. In between these two

105
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:42,029
thoughts this area exists, of the present.
Now...But if I say you stop at this point,

106
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:51,910
to be at this point, you cannot. Your mind
is jumping either on the past or on the future.

107
00:16:55,569 --> 00:17:02,569
But the Kundalini is the only thing that stops
you at present moment so that you don't consider

108
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:13,829
the past and the future but you enjoy the
present, the complete dynamism of the present

109
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:23,100
and you are effective, you are dynamic. You
can do thousand and one thing, which normally

110
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:32,209
you cannot do and you are surprised how it
works out.

111
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,890
The Divine has Its own plans, has Its own
understanding and we cannot make the Divine

112
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:46,890
to work as we want. We have to accept whatever
the Divine does and manages and then we see

113
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:54,289
the miracles of the Divine and we are surprised
how efficient It is, how beautiful It is,

114
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:03,760
like a machine. We feel the efficiency of
the Divine but above all we feel the compassion,

115
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,940
the love, the understanding of the Divine.
But first we must rise up to that. And for

116
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:21,970
that one has to grow in the awareness of the
Spirit. If we cannot develop the awareness

117
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:28,970
of the Spirit, we loose that magnitude which
we have to achieve. So what is to be respected

118
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:39,200
is the Spirit after Realization, because it
gives you the truth.

119
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:45,529
To understand the truth you have to be the
Spirit, otherwise whatever you understand

120
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:52,529
is falsehood, is not the truth. Because of
your mental projection you think that that

121
00:18:53,779 --> 00:19:00,779
is the truth, is not so. For example now,
if I am sitting on this chair you won't know

122
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:11,080
anytime that I ever sat on this chair. But
supposing there's a Realized soul who comes

123
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:18,080
round, immediately he will know that there
was someone like Me. For example I say that

124
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:27,450
Mozart was a Realized soul. How do I know?
He's dead now. Because you can feel it on

125
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:37,640
vibrations that he was a Realized soul. I
say: "Abraham Lincoln was a Realized soul."

126
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,159
Not because the way he lived or what he did,
that what just an expression or was the symptom

127
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:50,159
of his greatness but because when you think
of him you get cool breeze in your hands,

128
00:19:53,370 --> 00:20:00,370
tremendously cool breeze, soothing, which
crawls over you: "Oh, that's Abraham Lincoln."

129
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:07,520
We do not know where we spend our time, what
people are important to us till we are the

130
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:18,090
Spirit. We waste our time catering to something
absolutely useless, and then suddenly we discover:

131
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:27,820
"Oh, God, what a waste of time, what a waste
of energy, what a waste of money. This man

132
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:35,230
was a cheat. He cheated me. This work was
all falsehood. Why did I waste my time there?

133
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:43,779
After Realization you become the absolute.
There is no relative value, you do not judge

134
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:51,850
anything relatively, you just know what is
absolute and once you know the absolute you

135
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:59,789
are quite sure about it, there's no wavering.
Thus you become an extremely powerful person

136
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:04,390
and you know the truth about everything.

137
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:11,390
Now the truth is very simple that you are
the Spirit and you are not this body, you

138
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:19,380
are not this mind and you are not this ego
or your conditionings but you are the free

139
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:26,950
Spirit, that's the truth is. But it is not
just a mental truth but is actually so and

140
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:36,799
has to be actualized. The third thing that
happens to you apart from your awareness becoming

141
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:46,760
the truth, the complete knowledge, you become
the source of joy, not that you only receive

142
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,880
the joy but you become the source of joy,
the source of bliss and the source of peace.

143
00:21:56,399 --> 00:22:00,340
Wherever such a person goes, it just sooths.

144
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:07,340
Yesterday you saw a lady, she had very stiff
fingers, she couldn't move them... and as

145
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:16,559
soon as I said: "What's wrong with your fingers?"
she started moving them. She was amazed how

146
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:23,559
she started moving. Just my attention, just
one question. I said: "What's wrong with your

147
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:30,230
hands?" she just started moving. She said:
"Am I cured?" First she said is some nervous

148
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:37,230
trouble and then she saw: "Oh, it's moving,
it's all right, cured." How? Because you get

149
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:43,980
that power within yourself of compassion,
which doesn't expect any thing, it just works

150
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:50,980
and acts silently. Just paying attention to
that person itself, it's sufficient. Just

151
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:59,390
one glance at that person can save that person
from any kind of malady. It works but of course

152
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:09,919
it is true also those who are not deserving
at all, those who are crooked people, those

153
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:19,990
who are cruel, say for example Hitler, you
cannot give him Realization, can you? He has

154
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,309
to suffer.

155
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:34,309
So, also these illusions that we have about
people, [THAT OH], we should be kind to everyone,

156
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:44,640
we should be nice. The kindness of the Divine
to the crooks is not the way we look at it.

157
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:53,169
The kindness to the crooks is punishment.
It's a wrathful God. It punishes crooks. Many

158
00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:02,570
people feel that, I mean it's a [MEREST] mental
attitude to say that everything is illusion,

159
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:11,090
so crookery is also an illusion. It is not.
For you it is just a mental attitude, that's

160
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:23,600
all. For the people who are in the boat is
all right to say that the ocean is an illusion

161
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:31,519
but not for the people who are in the water.
That's just a mental problem that they think

162
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:39,600
it's not an illusion or a illusion, it is
not the fact with them, it's not actually

163
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,600
with them. But once you rise above that, to
you it is an illusion but to the Divine it's

164
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:54,679
a duty to correct it. And Divine looks after
you. All the blessings of the Divine starts

165
00:24:54,679 --> 00:25:01,679
showering upon you and you are amazed how
it has worked, how it has helped you, how

166
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:08,700
it has done good to you. You are amazed how
all the things that you desire you get, your

167
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:17,250
desires change, you ask for something and
you just get it. Because these desires that

168
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:23,570
are there are based on something that Divine
wants.

169
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:30,570
Like one we had a doctor who was working in
Riad, and he had a feeling that he should

170
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:37,590
go to Abba, which is a place very much down
trodden and where he thought Sahaja Yoga will

171
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:43,059
work better. So he was very anxious, he wrote
a very anxious letter to Me, that: "Mother,

172
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:47,740
please see that I go to Abba." That letter
he had just posted, he tried his level best,

173
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:54,740
he couldn't do it. Had just posted, I never
received it, even then he got the appointment.

174
00:25:55,169 --> 00:26:01,100
So, the whole attitude towards life changes.
Like today if you ask Sahaja Yogis, they said:

175
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:07,029
"Mother, we must go to Mexico." I said: "How
far is?" "Fifteen, twenty minutes." "All right."

176
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:14,029
The reason is they wanted Me to put My attention
to Mexico. They are not limited to America

177
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:20,049
only. Now, Mexico is important to them. Let's
do how we work it out.

178
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:24,320
Otherwise people could have had some other
desires, other things. Little desires like

179
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:31,190
having a house, having a car, having a job,
these are all fulfilled in no time. There's

180
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:38,190
no problem on them. Krishna has said: [Hindi
talk], when you get Yoga, when you get Realization,

181
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:46,710
you get your well being, your health improves,
your mind improves and last of all you become

182
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:54,909
the giver of gifts to others, in the sense
wherever you are, you are auspiciousness.

183
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You are so pure that your purity fills the
atmosphere with auspiciousness and this auspiciousness

184
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:11,460
when acts, you are amazed how people are helped
and how people are granted these beautiful

185
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:25,840
blessings through you. And you get aware of
it, you understand it.

186
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,480
That's what we can learn from the lives of
Christ and all other such great personalities

187
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,399
who came on this earth, how they worked out
things for others and how they granted them

188
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:45,399
whatever they desired. You become absolutely
dynamic as far as the creativity is concerned,

189
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:52,039
you become great creators if your interest
is in that, you become great healers as they

190
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:58,409
call it, but not that you heal persons by
charging them money or talking about money,

191
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:05,279
but only being in the presence of these people
you just heal them.

192
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:12,049
You become the source of all corrections,
but the corrections are not mental that you

193
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:15,720
give a lecture to them: "Now you don't do
this any, don't do that any, you shouldn't

194
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:22,720
do that." Just works out. Just people just
melt into that compassion which you are. You

195
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:36,450
don't have to fight anyone, you don't have
to struggle. It just works out. It's so powerful.

196
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:43,669
The most powerful power is of love, of pure
love and this purity when emits through you,

197
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:51,419
you are amazed that why people have not used
this power of love. They have only used the

198
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:58,419
power of hatred. All these problems drop out,
your family problems, your city problems,

199
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:08,090
your national problems, your world problems
all drop out. Because all problems come from

200
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:15,090
human beings who are yet very selfish, very
secluded, very abnormally attached to limitations.

201
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:28,980
The whole thing works out so beautifully and
we have to create such personalities. For

202
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:35,980
that God has sent on this Earth great people.
I see everywhere, they are very great people,

203
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:45,309
very special category of people who understand
that they have to play a role in the working

204
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:52,940
of the Divine, and they work it out in such
a manner, that they contribute to the well-being

205
00:29:55,529 --> 00:30:02,529
of the whole Universe. America, I must say,
has been the least concerned country about

206
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:10,340
this, I must say. Is the poorest as far as
evolution is concerned. I'm sorry, but has

207
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:17,820
been so. They have had all kinds of gurus
here, all kinds of things but in Sahaja Yoga

208
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:24,820
I find them, they are not there. I'm quite
surprised at it, that their interests are

209
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:33,220
so funny, that they have such limited interest
in life or what I don't understand.

210
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:41,639
I've been to this country many a times, of
course not so much as I've been to other countries

211
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:48,639
it was every time I have come, I felt that
they have to still come up to a point to see

212
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:56,110
that truth has to be accepted, is to be received.
Because if the truth is exposed to people

213
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:05,840
who are not yet ready, maybe it will be all
lost. It's like the story of Christ where

214
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:15,769
He describes the seeds, which fell on the
rock, some fell on the right ground. This

215
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:25,320
is what it is and I face it up. I feel sometimes
that such a great country like India, which

216
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:33,320
is now awakening very nicely to Sahaja Yoga,
which was just a slave country for 300 years.

217
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:43,019
Or we can say there are countries like Italy,
which are very important but were sort of

218
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:50,460
always neglected, treated as something useless,
are coming up, because Spirit is higher than

219
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,429
anything else. Politics, economics is nothing
for Spirit.

220
00:31:54,429 --> 00:32:01,000
Now, let us see what happens in America. Let
us see what is going to awaken them. I don't

221
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,080
know what is going to [STIRR] them. Because
they are also placed in the Vishuddhi chakra.

222
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:14,080
This is the center where America is placed.
This is the most important center also. And

223
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:22,730
if this center is not going to be awakened
then one has to see to it that something happens.

224
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:33,419
The Divine might rock and shock and tell you
that better accept to your spiritual life,

225
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:40,419
is important. Is very important that we should
hold the Divine in our arms and try to accept

226
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:53,649
that. People don't realize it, that it is
not proper to live with mundane life, day

227
00:32:55,529 --> 00:33:02,529
to day life but should think of the wider
repercussions that can have on the people

228
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:11,529
who do not think of the calamities that can
fall on upon them if they don't accept the

229
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,190
truth. Truth must be accepted.

230
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:23,669
You see the countries, which have vanished,
like Romans who were such great countries.

231
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:30,669
They had a fall. Why? Because they took to
a life which was destructive, to such a limit

232
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:35,350
that I've heard some people saying: "We, we
have a right to destroy ourselves." You have

233
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:42,200
no right at all. You cannot create yourself
and you cannot destroy yourself. So one has

234
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:49,200
to realize that if we have any right that
is one to be the Spirit, to be that power,

235
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:57,210
which can make others the Spirit, which can
make others the source of joy, what they are.

236
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:01,100
This is the epitome of our evolution.

237
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:08,100
This is the last judgment as I told you and
the Kundalini is going to judge you, Kundalini

238
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:16,419
is going to judge you. It is not anybody is
going to weigh you and say: "You are such

239
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:21,050
a weight so you are all right" or "Your brain
has so much weight so you are all right."

240
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:28,050
But the judgment will come to you when your
Kundalini will rise. You will judge yourself.

241
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:35,440
And you will judge yourself by denying or
accepting the Spirithood, the oneness with

242
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:44,149
the Divine, that's a fact, I must declare
it to you. Because that is what is very important

243
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:50,159
to understand and as a Mother I feel very
concerned, very concerned that such a big

244
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:57,159
population should not go a waste, just a waste
because they could not realize the importance

245
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:05,040
of their being, of their own life, of their
own role as spiritual beings. May God bless

246
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,609
you all.

247
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:19,609
The lecture can go on because on the Spirit
I must have given at least, I don't know,

248
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:25,849
about at least hundred lectures so far, only
on the subject of Spirit. So it's an endless

249
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:30,300
job. And every time I say something people
say: "Mother you have said something very

250
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,990
new." So the knowledge is endless but you
become the knowledge, you yourself become

251
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:41,480
the knowledge and you start understanding
it. Only thing is you must have as a duty,

252
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:48,480
respect for yourself and the importance of
responsibility that you have to be the Spirit.

253
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:55,869
That's why you have come on this earth as
human beings, at this time. This time is very

254
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:03,140
precious and it's not a fashion to be a seeker
but it's something that has to happen to all

255
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,510
of you.

256
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:11,030
Yesterday you people asked me many questions
and I think I answered most of them. Some

257
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:18,030
of them were very good questions but some
of them were a little very simple I think,

258
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:26,730
but nobody was aggressive... But on the whole
I think that maybe San Diego is a place from

259
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:34,940
where we may be able to save America. I didn't
have any program anywhere in Los Angeles or

260
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:40,569
anything, but I came to San Diego. But you
have to know that if this is the place we

261
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:47,569
have to get people who are of that quality.
I don't know when are we going to get them

262
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:55,430
but I hope we get those people of that quality.
Even a small nail can hold a sari. In the

263
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:04,310
same way a little place looking like San Diego
can save America. May God bless you all.

264
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:20,560
So we'll have the experience now. It will
take about five minutes for you because if

265
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:26,619
all the chakras are discussed already the
attention is on that. Is very simple to put

266
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:33,619
your hands towards Me. (It's better. You've
done a good job.) Just put your hands towards

267
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:54,950
Me. Just like this. Left. Now, left hand towards
Me and right hand towards the Mother Earth.

268
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,420
We'll give you a balance. You need not close
your eyes just now, let's see. Put your right

269
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:34,420
hand towards the Mother Earth. As I told you
yesterday left side is our conditioning, conditioning,

270
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:43,349
subconscious and collective subconscious,
very much at work here. But also is an emotional

271
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:50,440
side. Now put your right hand towards Me and
left hand towards the sky. Right hand towards

272
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:09,970
Me, right hand towards Me like this. Are you
feeling the cool breeze in the hand? You are

273
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:34,200
already thoughtless, there's no thought, but
just see if you are feeling the cool breeze.

274
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:46,280
(Much better.) Are you? Let's see. All right?

275
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:46,550
Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hand?
All right, now put your left hand on top of

276
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:07,559
your head, just here, fontanel bone area.
Are you feeling? It's a very subtle thing.

277
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:20,700
Are you? Pay attention. (Working out.) Good?
All right. Now, change over. See the left

278
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:38,710
hand, with the right hand. Just pay attention
there, see. Believe that you are the Spirit.

279
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:51,900
So just you have to say in your heart: "I
am the Spirit", in your heart. Say it seven

280
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,720
times, it will work out. Releasing. Is it
all right? Are you feeling the heat coming

281
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:17,530
out? Little heat. All right, now turn, change,
see now. Right Swadhishthan. All right? [UNCLEAR]

282
00:42:33,069 --> 00:42:40,069
Now, just see, if it is working cool breeze...
Feel it. Just put your hands like this. It's

283
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:58,800
good? You are all thoughtless. If you see,
there's no thought in your mind. And complete

284
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:19,250
silence. Enjoy this. This moment is going
to transform your life, take it from Me. You

285
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:31,430
may not realize today but you'll realize it
very soon. Stop. Have faith in yourself, that's

286
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:48,250
the main thing. It's beautiful. Now, all those
who are feeling the cool breeze in the hand

287
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:59,500
or in the head, from the head, please raise
your hands, all, both the hands like this.

288
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:07,930
Could you believe it? Most of you. May God
bless you. Except for one or two. Maybe you

289
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:15,380
have come for the first time. Have you come
for the first time? All right, maybe, we'll

290
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:22,380
see you, it's not difficult. Today it's very
powerful day, is worked out. Now know that

291
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:29,640
you've found it but establish yourself. This
is very important is to establish. Luckily

292
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:36,640
you have a very good center here. And we have
to work it out through San Diego, from this

293
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:43,069
side and from New Jersey from the other side.
We have to work it out.

294
00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:50,069
All of you must remember that you have got
your Realization. I don't want to take any

295
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:58,599
promises from you because I depend on your
Spirit. Respect it. Respect your Realization.

296
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:07,640
Respect yourself. Now you will find you have
a purpose in life and just understand how

297
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:14,640
this Divine power works and how we can manage
it and control it, how we can maneuver it

298
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:23,829
and how it works in the larger interest, in
the higher interest, in the nobler interest,

299
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:33,250
in the righteous life. You become that and
others also become. May God bless you. It's

300
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:43,470
a time that clicks and that's why one should
understand why somebody's late, why somebody's

301
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:53,170
early. All right. These two gentlemen and
there are some ladies here who haven't got

302
00:45:53,170 --> 00:46:00,109
the Realization so I hope the Sahaja Yogis
will help them but I'll come down to shake

303
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:07,109
hands with you.

304
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:14,670
Those who haven't got Realization please raise
your hands and don't wear your shoes. Just

305
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:21,670
they'll come down and see for yourself. Please
be seated. Just five minutes more. Five minutes.

306
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,160
Don't be in such a great hurry.

307
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:32,300
(What she say?) I'm sorry, I'm just saying
that you wait for five minutes, I'm coming

308
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:39,300
down and we'll see, those who haven't got
Realization will get it. Don't be in a hurry.

309
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,920
What's the time now? I better ask because
you all seem to be very much in a hurry. For

310
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:02,730
what? Do you know I travel all over the world
and I mean you know I don't earn anything

311
00:47:12,089 --> 00:47:19,089
out of it, as such money wise and tomorrow
I go to New York, then to Switzerland, then

312
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:49,240
to Spain, all over the places. But how do
I do it? Because I'm paid in the way what

313
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:56,210
we call is beyond human awareness: the joy.
And that's what one has to achieve. So don't

314
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:10,180
be 

315
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:26,660
in 
a hurry. Nothing is going to run away from
San Diego, I can tell you. Let's see. (They

316
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:14,589
are not so speedy, they are not so speedy
like New York...)
