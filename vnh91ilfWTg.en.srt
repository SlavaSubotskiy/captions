00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:03,579
Birthday Puja March 21, 1998
Delhi, India

2
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:58,137
 I was overjoyed to see

3
00:04:58,218 --> 00:05:06,136
this beautiful welcome.the way you had organized

4
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:16,246
I must say that it’s your love which finds

5
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:27,071
all kind of expressions of enjoying Sahaja Yoga.

6
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:37,291
I really can’t understand how these unique ideas

7
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:45,640
come to your heads, and you represent

8
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:51,380
the different countries from where you have come.

9
00:05:52,362 --> 00:06:00,478
I wish you carry these flags back to
your own countries,

10
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:05,664
and tell them the message that the time has come

11
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:12,481
 for our resurrection, that we have to rise.

12
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:18,548
We have to rise above this human level

13
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,373
to a higher level of existence.

14
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:28,328
And if that happens, then how it changes your life,

15
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:37,029
 how it makes you happy,
how you lose all your absurd ideas of hatred

16
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:50,383
 and of harming others, injuring others: all this kind of ideas

17
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:58,547
 which have worked out to give some sort of
a sadistic pleasure to many people,

18
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:07,876
and they have enjoyed the way they want to destroy

19
00:07:08,353 --> 00:07:12,773
 the joy of others, the happiness of others.

20
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:20,562
To maintain the happiness, I know, you being Sahaja Yogis,

21
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:27,349
 you have to bear a lot, tolerate a lot of nonsense.

22
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:33,411
You have already done it, and gradually once

23
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:39,837
Sahaja Yoga is established in your own countries as something

24
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:45,090
that is so beautiful, so very pure,

25
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:50,776
so very important that all others in your countries

26
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:59,357
 also will try to follow that path which you have crossed over.

27
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:04,302
Only your lives are the ones which will reflect

28
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:10,551
 the beauty of your inner being and of Sahaja Yoga.

29
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:18,004
I told you yesterday what was missing in the human awareness,

30
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:22,338
 and that the attention was not on the Spirit.

31
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:29,500
But when it is on the Spirit, what happens to you?

32
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:37,636
Firstly you become according to Sanskrit words, gunatit:

33
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,319
you go beyond all the three gunas.

34
00:08:42,626 --> 00:08:51,678
That means you are no more a person who is tamo guni,

35
00:08:51,703 --> 00:09:02,860
means the one who has got all kinds of desires of self-indulgence.

36
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:09,602
Your attention moves from there to the second style

37
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:13,978
where you are rajo guni, the right-sidedness:

38
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:16,911
they want to do something, want to show something,

39
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:21,489
you want to become something, you want to compete with others.

40
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:24,457
All this struggle just disappears.

41
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,617
"Atit" means beyond.

42
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:33,553
Then sattwa guni: that is also where you are seeking,

43
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,239
where you see that what’s wrong in this kind of extreme behavior,

44
00:09:39,366 --> 00:09:43,071
and you just hate that kind of life

45
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:48,626
 and you want to get out of it, and then you start seeking.

46
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:51,462
That also is finished.

47
00:09:51,684 --> 00:09:58,490
All the gunas are finished, so you become gunatit.

48
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:05,675
It just happens when your attention goes to your Spirit,

49
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:13,163
 because now the attention is not on any one of your inherent,

50
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:19,376
 you can say, or conditioned qualities, or of egoistical qualities.

51
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:27,205
So you become a person who is beyond this.

52
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:35,087
This is something very remarkable as far as

53
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:39,776
for normal life, but for you it is not, it just happens.

54
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:42,547
You just enjoy being yourself.

55
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:49,116
You’re no more concerned about your own conveniences,
comforts and petty things.

56
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:53,784
But what happens is that you just go beyond

57
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:57,546
all these three gunas which have been

58
00:10:57,714 --> 00:11:03,210
dominating you this way or that way.

59
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:13,334
So that’s how you cross the limit of human awareness, firstly.

60
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:24,295
Then the second one is, you become kalatit: you go beyond time.

61
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:28,674
I know today I was late somehow.

62
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,366
It just works out that way.

63
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,689
But you didn’t miss the time.

64
00:11:33,714 --> 00:11:37,469
You were still enjoying.
 I could see, sitting in the house,

65
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,340
that you are all in a very enjoyable mood,

66
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:43,378
all of you are enjoying nicely.

67
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:47,298
I’m not here, but still you are enjoying.

68
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:49,821
This is beyond time.

69
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:52,192
You’re not bound by time.

70
00:11:52,217 --> 00:11:56,166
Whatever is the time is your own, because

71
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,896
you are standing in the present,

72
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:04,527
you are not standing here and thinking of the future.

73
00:12:04,838 --> 00:12:08,186
You didn’t think about what will happen tomorrow

74
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:12,163
 or how will you catch your plane, or how will you do this.

75
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:14,432
Here you were just enjoying,

76
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:19,329
 enjoying the present, and the present is the reality.

77
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:24,258
If you are thinking of the future or of the past,

78
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:27,512
then you are not in reality.
I have told many-a-times

79
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:30,836
 that past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

80
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:34,865
So at this moment you are here sitting,

81
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:38,834
 perhaps may be waiting for Me, may be

82
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:43,191
 just enjoying every moment of your stay here,

83
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:46,493
 of your connections with others.

84
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:50,517
And this enjoyment cannot be described,

85
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:53,675
 how you are enjoying this.

86
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:57,652
Otherwise people would be seeing the watch,

87
00:12:57,724 --> 00:13:00,374
wondering, “Why Mother has not come?

88
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:02,239
What is the problem?

89
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:08,716
Why She is not arrived?” and all kinds of ideas can go round.

90
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:12,602
It helps a lot to be kalatit.

91
00:13:12,863 --> 00:13:17,479
I remember in Nasik I had to work very hard because

92
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:20,732
 no Sahaja Yogi would come forward to do anything,

93
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:24,118
they were so shy and so much worried.

94
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:28,891
And it so happened, luckily or unluckily we can say,

95
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:31,653
 that My car failed on the way and

96
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,492
I was delayed in going.

97
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:43,429
About one hour passed, there was no car coming that way,
there’s no way to go,

98
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:46,654
and we were stranded on the road.

99
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,675
Now surprisingly, when I reached the place

100
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:56,594
where we were going to have the program,
the Sahaja Yogis took over.

101
00:13:56,764 --> 00:14:01,782
They took the responsibility, and they were very busy

102
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:05,776
giving Realizations to others and working it out.

103
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,673
Otherwise they would not.

104
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:11,058
They could not believe that they have power to give Realization.

105
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:14,650
I may tell them, but they would not raise their hands.

106
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:21,046
And just because the time was there
and they thought, “So many people are here,

107
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:26,742
Mother is not coming or She may be coming,
 so it’s our responsibility.”

108
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:30,306
In that way they took the responsibility.

109
00:14:30,354 --> 00:14:35,764
So when you are beyond the time,
 you become responsible for that moment.

110
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,268
It’s such a responsibility which is also collective,

111
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:46,517
means you just all of you become responsible.

112
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:51,589
It’s very surprising, we are so many here,

113
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:55,052
there’s no quarrel, no fight, nothing.

114
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:59,939
We are very nicely settled down, just beyond

115
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:05,169
 all kinds of stupid ideas of attacking each other.

116
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:12,467
That happens because you are not involved with the time.

117
00:15:12,618 --> 00:15:15,091
The time cannot bow you down.

118
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:19,094
Perhaps if it were not you people, some other people,

119
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:22,529
 they would have thrown stones on My car,

120
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:28,291
 thinking,  “So it is so late She comes,
we are here boiling in the heat.”

121
00:15:28,406 --> 00:15:30,716
They would have resented.

122
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:34,140
But not the people who are beyond time.

123
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:37,389
They are nicely sitting down, enjoying themselves.

124
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:43,110
It doesn’t matter, the time passes on.

125
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:50,887
Then you become dharmatit: you become beyond dharma,

126
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:58,919
 beyond your human nature.

127
00:16:00,073 --> 00:16:04,335
That means whatever you do is religious,

128
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:11,094
whatever is your endeavor is religious.

129
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,856
If, say, you are in a business,

130
00:16:16,094 --> 00:16:20,117
you would like to do business in a religious manner,

131
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,127
because you are beyond religion you are not bothered as to

132
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:29,579
follow a particular pattern or ritual of any religion,

133
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:32,198
but you are beyond it.

134
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:41,093
Like people who are, you see, not beyond religion:

135
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:46,091
 they must get up early in the morning,  they are bound

136
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:51,280
by their rituals and they pass through the rituals,

137
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:56,128
and if one of the rituals is not done
they are very unhappy and shaken up.

138
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,790
But not you.

139
00:16:57,894 --> 00:17:01,014
For you, you are always in dhyan,

140
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:05,641
 always in meditative mood, and anything goes wrong

141
00:17:05,842 --> 00:17:08,868
you just jump into that awareness

142
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:13,236
where you get the solution, and you are not disturbed,

143
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:18,663
not disturbed at all when things go wrong.

144
00:17:18,853 --> 00:17:24,419
Like ritualistic nature makes you very constricted,

145
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:28,799
very docile, sometimes can be aggressive also.

146
00:17:29,062 --> 00:17:33,305
People with their ritualism trouble others a lot.

147
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:39,010
Like one lady who was supposed to be our friend came to My house.

148
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,433
So she said, "I’m a vegetarian."
I said, "Then?"

149
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:48,892
"But I can’t eat the food in which non–veg. food has been cooked."

150
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:50,773
"All right.

151
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:53,969
So we’ll have to get new utensils."

152
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:56,943
So I went and bought new utensils for her.

153
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,900
So she said that "You have to be careful

154
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,781
that even the spoon should not be used."

155
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,938
So I had to go and get for her a spoon.

156
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:14,420
Then she said, "Tumblers; because people are taking food here

157
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,598
 who are eating non–veg. food,

158
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:23,175
so you better get us something which is absolutely new."

159
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,227
So I had to incur all these problems.

160
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:30,137
And then she was in the kitchen and she wouldn’t allow

161
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:32,344
our cook to cook anything for us.

162
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:35,735
She said, "First I will cook, and then you can cook."

163
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:38,980
And she made such a nuisance out of her

164
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:43,186
that instead of being a guest she became a pest,

165
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:47,410
and this is what happens to people who are ritualistic,

166
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:49,942
 because they are very demanding.

167
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:53,692
They go on demanding that “This is our dharma.”

168
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:59,756
I know of another story was told to Me by somebody in Bombay.

169
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,690
She said, "This lady who came to me as a guest, because

170
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:07,118
 she was related to something very high up,

171
00:19:07,357 --> 00:19:11,790
she was worse than my great-great-great-grandmother."

172
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,625
I said, "Really?"

173
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,251
She said, "I can’t understand that in India

174
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:19,798
 we have such people still living.

175
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:24,891
She came here and she said, ‘I cannot take water from the tap.

176
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:28,846
You have to get it from some sort of a well.’

177
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:32,633
“Now, there are only two wells in Bombay.

178
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:36,202
So people had to go and fetch the water,

179
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:40,967
but the cook had to be completely drenched in water

180
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:43,349
and then only he could cook.

181
00:19:43,374 --> 00:19:46,783
“‘Because if he cooks without that, then I won’t eat.’

182
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:51,294
“And she went on, and on, and on there, and

183
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:53,748
 the cook got sick with pneumonia,

184
00:19:53,773 --> 00:19:57,677
another cook came and he got flu, you see?

185
00:19:57,702 --> 00:19:58,949
This lady didn’t mind.

186
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,149
“She said, ‘No, that’s my style.’"

187
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:05,428
So she asked Me, "What should we do with such people, Mother?"

188
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:08,534
I said, "You should have asked her
that ‘We have this thing.

189
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,504
If you like it well and good; otherwise you don’t eat,

190
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:15,692
it’s all right, good. Fasting is a very good thing.’

191
00:20:16,486 --> 00:20:21,265
That’s the only solution for such people who are so self-centered

192
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,773
 and so much bothering others.”

193
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:27,886
So this self-centeredness comes to us

194
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:30,759
because we think, "This is our dharma,

195
00:20:30,784 --> 00:20:35,389
this is our right, this is - everything belongs to us.

196
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:38,294
How dare they do not do it?"

197
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,803
How much we trouble others, how much we make them inconvenient,

198
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:50,150
how much we try to make their lives miserable,
 we never think.

199
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,111
We go on demanding things,

200
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:58,183
“This is my dharma, what can I do?

201
00:20:58,597 --> 00:21:00,581
This is what I have to do.”

202
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:03,907
But it becomes such a conditioning of the mind

203
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:07,794
that I have seen many cases in Sahaja Yoga

204
00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:09,668
who got conditioned like that.

205
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:14,448
There was a lady, French lady who came to Sahaja Yoga,

206
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:18,657
 and her mother was very ritualistic to begin with,

207
00:21:18,887 --> 00:21:25,116
 and she was so troublesome that she must go to church every Sunday.

208
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:30,511
She would dress up well, go to church and come back home.

209
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:33,625
And one day she just disappeared.

210
00:21:33,777 --> 00:21:36,821
So they told the police to find out this lady,

211
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:40,753
and when he went to find out the lady,
 the police said that

212
00:21:40,778 --> 00:21:44,121
 "We can’t find her, God knows where she has disappeared."

213
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,711
Then she said, "All right, go and find out in the church."

214
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:50,015
She was still sitting in the church.

215
00:21:50,146 --> 00:21:52,376
Next time again she disappeared.

216
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,190
It happened three, four times.

217
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:57,214
So the police said, "Sorry, we are finished with her.

218
00:21:57,239 --> 00:22:02,569
Now if you want you can put her in
the old people’s house, and that’s all."

219
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:06,029
So they sent her to an old people’s house.

220
00:22:06,342 --> 00:22:10,826
So this Sahaja Yogini told Me, "Mother, very surprising,

221
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:13,699
 they are otherwise very stupid people,

222
00:22:13,786 --> 00:22:19,136
 they go on sitting, brooding, talking nonsense like mad,

223
00:22:19,161 --> 00:22:24,404
 they have all become senile and their senility can be very well seen.

224
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:30,471
But what happens that on a Sunday
they all dress up well and go to church.

225
00:22:31,302 --> 00:22:34,872
That’s the only point where they are sane."

226
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:38,272
It is very surprising how the conditioning works.

227
00:22:38,297 --> 00:22:41,098
There was one person I had

228
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:45,304
 who came and stayed with us, and he said, "I’m very good driver."

229
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:46,912
So I said, "All right."

230
00:22:46,937 --> 00:22:49,621
But he only know driving, he didn’t know about London,

231
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:51,947
what sort of a place London is.

232
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:54,737
Now he knew the driving very well,

233
00:22:54,762 --> 00:22:59,288
but if I had to go to the north, he’ll drive Me to the south.

234
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:03,157
If I had to go to the east, he’ll drive Me to the west.

235
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,758
I said, "What’s the matter?

236
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:08,515
You know driving?"
"Yes, I know driving, that I know,

237
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:12,389
but I don’t know anything about road, I have no road sense."

238
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:14,383
One day the police got hold of him.

239
00:23:14,408 --> 00:23:15,883
I was also in the car.

240
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:17,963
He said, "Where are you going?"

241
00:23:18,312 --> 00:23:21,406
He said, "I am going to such and such place."

242
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:25,290
So he said, "Now you have been to this place six times.

243
00:23:25,315 --> 00:23:29,074
Again you are coming back to the same point six times!"

244
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:33,476
So in the old age I have known that these things form

245
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:35,619
 a kind of a habit,

246
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:39,449
 but in young age also you can find people

247
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:42,600
get so conditioned by their style.

248
00:23:42,691 --> 00:23:48,056
So this is what you can call the human element,

249
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:53,391
 where you get attached or get bothered about something.

250
00:23:54,439 --> 00:24:00,123
Now it’s a kind of a, I should say, a madness

251
00:24:00,362 --> 00:24:03,631
 that somebody demands this, somebody demands that,

252
00:24:03,663 --> 00:24:06,739
"I don’t like this, I don’t like that."

253
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:09,284
It goes on, and on, and on.

254
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:14,511
It’s so common to say "I don’t like,” “I like."

255
00:24:14,882 --> 00:24:19,221
It is very surprising that they go on saying like this.

256
00:24:19,246 --> 00:24:23,407
They go to somebody’s house, "No, no, I don’t like this carpet."

257
00:24:23,432 --> 00:24:27,255
I mean, it’s not your carpet, you’ve not purchased it.

258
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,175
This person has purchased the carpet.

259
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,113
What have you got to do?

260
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,816
Why should you say "I don’t like"?

261
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:33,944
Who are you?

262
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:35,430
You have not paid for you.

263
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:38,583
The one who has paid likes it, finished!

264
00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:41,911
Why do you want to pass your remarks, "I don’t like it"?

265
00:24:41,936 --> 00:24:45,202
Are you a connoisseur, so to criticize others?

266
00:24:45,438 --> 00:24:49,280
Somebody is wearing, supposing, the hairdress in a way,

267
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:52,521
 but "I don’t like this kind of hairdress."

268
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:53,787
"Why?"

269
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:57,690
"I don’t like, that’s all."

270
00:25:04,263 --> 00:25:07,797
Then it goes from there to human beings and everyone.

271
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:12,046
Who are you to like or dislike?

272
00:25:12,308 --> 00:25:14,252
What is your position?

273
00:25:14,363 --> 00:25:19,305
Why should you say “I like” or “don’t like”?

274
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:23,333
But is very common, specially in the West,

275
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:27,864
 to pass such remarks, "I don’t like it."

276
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:29,991
"I don’t like India."

277
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:32,119
"All right, if you don’t like, sit at home.

278
00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:33,857
Why did you come here?"

279
00:25:33,906 --> 00:25:36,032
"I don’t like Turkey."

280
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,627
"Why?"

281
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:42,816
Because if supposing anybody is wearing a long skirt,

282
00:25:42,893 --> 00:25:47,414
they’ll say, "No, I don’t like it because it is Turkish."

283
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:50,870
So you should only wear short skirts.

284
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:54,232
But we don’t like short skirts, supposing.

285
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:57,460
But one should not say that "I don’t like it,"

286
00:25:57,485 --> 00:26:03,108
because it hurts people, it takes awaythe pride of the person.

287
00:26:04,338 --> 00:26:08,060
Now when you are in Sahaja Yoga

288
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:12,270
you must know that you are not normal human being,

289
00:26:12,295 --> 00:26:17,677
 according to the normal standards, you see, you are above them.

290
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,200
Your likes and dislikes are different from theirs,

291
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:25,280
and your whole attitude has changed.

292
00:26:25,957 --> 00:26:30,629
You are, sometimes you are just like children, I have seen.

293
00:26:31,203 --> 00:26:36,032
You talk like small little children, very innocently,

294
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,885
 and sometimes you talk very profound things.

295
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:44,469
Now this is unknown to people who are supposed to be normal,

296
00:26:44,557 --> 00:26:48,423
 because normal people, you know, they are so bombastic,

297
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:53,908
 all the time they go on saying "I, I, I."

298
00:26:54,974 --> 00:27:03,180
Kabira has said that when a goat is living,

299
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:08,036
she goes on saying "meh, meh, meh," means "I, I, I."

300
00:27:08,613 --> 00:27:15,348
But when she is dead and her intestines are drawn into

301
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:23,095
 a kind of a wire for, we call dhunak - means

302
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,252
 “with which they separate the seeds from the cotton"

303
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:31,090
- that time, what she says, "tu hi, tu hi, tu hi”:

304
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:37,462
 “you are, you are, you are." You are...

305
00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:45,549
When you say that, immediately
your attention goes away from others,

306
00:27:45,717 --> 00:27:50,271
finding faults with them, finding what’s wrong with them,

307
00:27:50,358 --> 00:27:54,898
 using your brains all the time to criticize others,

308
00:27:55,266 --> 00:28:00,484
to make fun of others, sometimes even to talk ill of others.

309
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,741
People enjoy gossips.

310
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:04,082
Why?

311
00:28:04,123 --> 00:28:06,319
They enjoy gossip

312
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:11,399
because they don’t know that another person is the same as myself,

313
00:28:11,743 --> 00:28:15,356
and I have no business to gossip about that person.

314
00:28:15,381 --> 00:28:19,419
So this understanding, I should say this loving

315
00:28:19,444 --> 00:28:24,080
 wisdom doesn’t exist when you are a normal human being.

316
00:28:24,363 --> 00:28:29,135
At the slightest provocation you can get angry,

317
00:28:29,264 --> 00:28:34,173
 start doing all kinds of things just like a bull in the

318
00:28:34,515 --> 00:28:37,205
 china shop, you can behave any way.

319
00:28:37,356 --> 00:28:41,179
Suddenly you’ll find them just growing up into that.

320
00:28:41,204 --> 00:28:45,414
The reason for that is, you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

321
00:28:46,097 --> 00:28:50,761
But Sahaja Yogi is a person who enjoys all kinds of things.

322
00:28:51,595 --> 00:28:57,298
Say somebody becomes very angry and hot-tempered.

323
00:28:58,001 --> 00:29:05,086
He also sees that what is happening, how he is behaving.

324
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:11,611
So, actually it is not a dharma
 that you get angry with someone, it’s not.

325
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:16,583
It is something very low to be angry with others,

326
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:21,862
 to be all the time shouting at others,
to be exacting things from others

327
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:27,186
 or to criticize others, thinking you are something great.

328
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:29,093
And this doesn’t pay.

329
00:29:29,965 --> 00:29:32,848
By the time you come to the end of life you’ll find

330
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:36,388
you haven’t got one friend, one neighbor.

331
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:42,500
Another thing is that when you are very egoistical,

332
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:45,616
you think no end of yourself

333
00:29:45,712 --> 00:29:49,762
and you go on talking, jabbering, talking, jabbering,

334
00:29:49,897 --> 00:29:52,991
and the another person just gets bored stiff;

335
00:29:53,228 --> 00:29:56,535
but still you are talking, talking, talking about yourself,

336
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:59,223
 "I did this, I did this, I went there.

337
00:29:59,248 --> 00:30:01,368
I, I, I…"

338
00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:09,249
It goes to any limit,
and you are not ashamed as to what you are saying.

339
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:16,765
I have seen people who have taken to all kinds of

340
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:23,685
 funny attitudes towards others,
when they are just normal human beings.

341
00:30:24,624 --> 00:30:30,915
If somebody says something wrong about somebody,
 somebody says that

342
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:35,412
"That person is like this, I know, you see he did this way."

343
00:30:35,437 --> 00:30:39,577
Immediately it goes into their mind, "Yes, it’s so."

344
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:46,491
Now that makes your mind a sick mind,

345
00:30:47,293 --> 00:30:52,268
we can say vikrudh, where the mind is not normal.

346
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:56,341
You become sick, and you accept all this sickness

347
00:30:56,444 --> 00:31:03,724
and go on accepting it, accepting it till you are a sick person,

348
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:09,019
 and this sickness is extremely dangerous.

349
00:31:09,154 --> 00:31:12,071
Not for others so much as for yourself,

350
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:16,460
because nobody can stand such a sick personality.

351
00:31:16,887 --> 00:31:22,777
Now you might say, I’ve seen people who have taken to religion.

352
00:31:23,086 --> 00:31:29,248
Like now I am a religious person, supposing now.

353
00:31:31,082 --> 00:31:34,756
You better be religious, so what?

354
00:31:34,781 --> 00:31:37,034
You can’t do this, you can’t do that,

355
00:31:37,106 --> 00:31:41,647
 you cannot sit here, you cannot eat this, this is important:

356
00:31:41,672 --> 00:31:47,083
 all try type the discipline others,
instead of disciplining yourself.

357
00:31:47,607 --> 00:31:51,786
Because when you are a normal person you don’t see yourself,

358
00:31:52,295 --> 00:31:56,750
 you just see others; but once you are a realized soul,

359
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:02,512
 you just start watching yourself and see for yourself what’s wrong.

360
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:10,195
Now after becoming the Spirit,
in the light of the Spirit you see yourself.

361
00:32:11,203 --> 00:32:13,099
You just see yourself.

362
00:32:13,817 --> 00:32:17,167
What happens, how you behave

363
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:23,461
and how you enjoy yourself, when you know how to correct yourself.

364
00:32:23,723 --> 00:32:25,603
It’s very sweet.

365
00:32:25,953 --> 00:32:30,273
Little, little things you do in such a beautiful manner,

366
00:32:30,337 --> 00:32:33,352
and you’ll say such beautiful things.

367
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:40,194
Of course there are people
who cannot be corrected, they’re incorrigible.

368
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:45,548
So also you should just see this is incorrigible, you can’t help it.

369
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:48,538
Like in Sahaja Yoga we have some people

370
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:52,541
who are all the time trying to help the wrong type of people,

371
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:57,275
 like they have taken a power of attorney in Sahaja Yoga.

372
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,354
So if somebody tries to be funny,

373
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:05,045
we expect a telephone call from that power of attorney.

374
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,329
After two hours, he tells, “Now,

375
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:12,759
please tell Mother that such and such person is to be looked after.

376
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,959
This has to be done, that has to be done.”

377
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:18,163
It’s absolutely a habitual thing with them

378
00:33:18,188 --> 00:33:22,327
to inform Me that “No, You must help, You must do something.”

379
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,222
But now it has become such a common practice,

380
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:30,000
and we know that he will just now come along

381
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:33,196
and give us a big lecture on this subject.

382
00:33:33,401 --> 00:33:38,796
So you see, it’s a nature of a human being

383
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:43,881
which has been going through the different types of

384
00:33:44,229 --> 00:33:51,126
complications in life,  also born with some genes or something

385
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:57,247
 that he is not a very normal person, though we say he’s normal;

386
00:33:57,405 --> 00:34:03,822
 because the way he reacts, the reaction that he shows is very absurd.

387
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:08,407
There’s no need for anybody to telephone to Me, to tell Me

388
00:34:08,432 --> 00:34:15,060
 that “You see, this man is such and such, You better look after him.”

389
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:20,130
Unnecessarily to interfere with others’ affairs

390
00:34:20,313 --> 00:34:23,138
when you have no authority,

391
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:27,094
 when you have nothing to do with that person.

392
00:34:27,185 --> 00:34:31,608
All sorts of, I can tell you, designs are there that

393
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:35,865
has been made into the minds of human beings,

394
00:34:35,984 --> 00:34:40,473
and these designs all disappear, just disappear.

395
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,207
I don’t know how they get all these designs, from where they get it -

396
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:48,738
 maybe their country, maybe their family, maybe their genes -

397
00:34:48,763 --> 00:34:53,887
whatever you may say, all this disappears, even your genes change.

398
00:34:54,253 --> 00:35:00,889
That is what is Sahaja Yoga,
where you become the Spirit; everything changes.

399
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:06,125
And what happens to you, that you become

400
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:11,792
a person who knows what is joy, who enjoys joy,

401
00:35:11,817 --> 00:35:16,354
who enjoys existence, who gives joy to others,

402
00:35:16,379 --> 00:35:21,909
makes others happy, all the time thinks how to make others happy.

403
00:35:22,075 --> 00:35:24,243
Just it happens,

404
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:27,802
 though you are brought up the same way as others are,

405
00:35:27,827 --> 00:35:31,889
 though you are being educated the same way,  maybe;

406
00:35:32,087 --> 00:35:39,294
 but all that disappears
and you become a wise, beautiful joyous person.

407
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:45,590
It’s something that you have achieved, of which you may not be aware,

408
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:50,600
the way you are enjoying in this scout-ground.

409
00:35:50,823 --> 00:35:53,988
No other group could have enjoyed as you have enjoyed.

410
00:35:54,043 --> 00:35:57,936
I can see what you are doing here and how you are enjoying,

411
00:35:58,254 --> 00:36:01,674
how you are enjoying the company of others,
  it’s very remarkable;

412
00:36:01,975 --> 00:36:07,292
 and that has come because your heart is full of joy

413
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:10,014
of the Spirit that shines within you.

414
00:36:10,464 --> 00:36:13,446
You can examine yourself and see for yourself

415
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:17,001
whatever I‘m saying is there or not of course,

416
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:20,189
There are some people who think no end of themself,

417
00:36:20,214 --> 00:36:23,864
they are staying in a hotel or some lodge, or something.

418
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:25,537
They are not enjoying.

419
00:36:26,085 --> 00:36:28,694
They still think that they are something great,

420
00:36:28,773 --> 00:36:32,804
so they must stay somewhere like that.

421
00:36:33,003 --> 00:36:35,891
Very surprisingly, specially Indians I have seen,

422
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:41,735
 when they come to Cabella they all want to stay in a hotel.

423
00:36:41,861 --> 00:36:46,211
In their lives they might be having one bathroom in their house,

424
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:49,739
but when they come to Cabella they want to stay in a hotel

425
00:36:49,764 --> 00:36:53,223
with attached bath,  this, that;

426
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:57,170
 young people, it’s very surprising.

427
00:36:57,274 --> 00:37:01,201
It happens because I think they have never seen a good hotel,

428
00:37:01,226 --> 00:37:04,600
 or may be that they have lived in a very bad condition.

429
00:37:04,671 --> 00:37:10,503
But a person who is a Sahaja Yogi
can live anywhere, can sleep anywhere.

430
00:37:11,116 --> 00:37:17,065
Only thing is that his Spirit is there to make him happy,
nothing else.

431
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:20,347
That is the One that gives you happiness.

432
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:26,822
All these other ideas that human beings have,
which have created problems after problems.

433
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:33,569
Now you see, because you belong to a different religion, you are bad.

434
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:36,559
If you want to know about the Christians,

435
00:37:36,615 --> 00:37:39,626
you’d better go and ask the Jews;

436
00:37:39,651 --> 00:37:43,657
and if you want to know about the Jews, better go and ask the Muslims;

437
00:37:43,682 --> 00:37:47,961
and if you want to know about the Muslims, go and ask the Hindus.

438
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:52,438
You’ll be amazed how they talk about other people

439
00:37:52,525 --> 00:37:55,785
as if all of them are bad, and they are the best.

440
00:37:55,833 --> 00:38:00,969
So this whole attitude changes completely.

441
00:38:01,205 --> 00:38:06,221
You forget it: who is what, whose religion is what,

442
00:38:06,246 --> 00:38:11,966
from what sort of family they come in,
from what is the background they are coming in.

443
00:38:12,078 --> 00:38:15,270
They become just one with each other.

444
00:38:15,455 --> 00:38:19,725
What they enjoy is the company of all the Sahaja Yogis.

445
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:23,263
All the Sahaja Yogis are there, that’s all.

446
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:27,562
So many Sahaja Yogis will be there, and that is the Mecca,

447
00:38:27,614 --> 00:38:32,648
 that is the Kumbha Mela, that you can call anything if you like.

448
00:38:32,758 --> 00:38:36,597
The collective joy that you enjoy has come to you

449
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:40,615
because you have crossed, crossed thatbarrier

450
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:45,120
which has stopped you from seeing the truth.

451
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:50,309
The truth is, as I said yesterday, that you are the Spirit,

452
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:58,725
and once you become the Spirit
you become gunatit, kalatit and dharmatit.

453
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:05,236
Once you cross these limits, then you become like a drop in the ocean.

454
00:39:05,374 --> 00:39:08,649
If the drop is outside the ocean,

455
00:39:08,727 --> 00:39:12,584
it’s always frightened of the sun because it will dry it up;

456
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:17,155
 he doesn’t know what to do, which way to slip, which way to move.

457
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,730
But once it is one with the ocean, it just moves

458
00:39:20,755 --> 00:39:24,899
and enjoy because he’s not alone, it’s not alone.

459
00:39:24,924 --> 00:39:30,873
It’s moving with the waves of that beautiful ocean of joy.

460
00:39:31,143 --> 00:39:35,292
And that is what you have achieved, of which you are aware;

461
00:39:35,317 --> 00:39:38,144
 you know, but you don’t know you have achieved it,

462
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:40,715
 because you are the Spirit.

463
00:39:41,665 --> 00:39:44,033
Now you should be on the watch

464
00:39:44,668 --> 00:39:49,908
about yourself sometimes,
 and you’d be amazed to see how you are changed,

465
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:56,425
 how you have become so simple and sensible and wise.

466
00:39:56,882 --> 00:40:00,339
So many problems come in the West because

467
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:05,152
 they are still stupid, I think, very stupid people.

468
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:10,817
Because even an old man of eighty years

469
00:40:10,881 --> 00:40:16,198
would like to marry a lady who seen 20 years

470
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:20,679
and he doesn’t understand why he is doing it,

471
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:24,632
because he doesn’t accept his age,

472
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:29,589
 he doesn’t accept that "I am an old man,
I must behave like an old man."

473
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:36,851
He wants to marry a girl who can be his granddaughter.

474
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:39,575
This is more common in the West.

475
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,340
They always think like that.

476
00:40:41,365 --> 00:40:45,044
Any young girl they see, they think they should marry that girl.

477
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:50,535
They may be just on their way to the grave,

478
00:40:50,694 --> 00:40:54,271
but doesn’t matter, they want to have a wife like that.

479
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:56,558
This is the problem of the West.

480
00:40:56,653 --> 00:40:58,397
Now how does it come?

481
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:03,461
Because they don’t understand that we are old,

482
00:41:03,803 --> 00:41:06,176
and to be old is to be proud.

483
00:41:06,201 --> 00:41:08,799
Now when I was five years,

484
00:41:08,824 --> 00:41:13,842
 I cannot imagine so many people could have
come to wish Me a happy birthday.

485
00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:17,442
Even when I was fifty years there were not so many people.

486
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:23,105
Now when I am seventy-five, see
how many people are there to wish Me happy birthday!

487
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:27,414
When you are old you should be proud of your age,

488
00:41:27,597 --> 00:41:31,441
 if you have lived wisely; but if you have been stupid,

489
00:41:31,466 --> 00:41:33,852
then of course nobody can help.

490
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:39,298
Everybody will laugh at such a person,
but they will do the same thing.

491
00:41:39,473 --> 00:41:44,765
It’s a custom in the West to go on having wives after wives,

492
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,077
 divorcing your wife and this, that.

493
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,375
In India it’s the other way round I should say,

494
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,336
they don’t have much respect for the women.

495
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:59,161
They were supposed to have great respect for women,

496
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:04,308
 supposed to have placed their women at the pedestal of a sati,

497
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:08,733
 and even if the woman may be anything, they don’t respect.

498
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,395
Now this is from where it has come, I don’t know.

499
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:18,206
Some of them say that it is written by some poet

500
00:42:19,016 --> 00:42:20,684
that a woman should be beaten up.

501
00:42:20,709 --> 00:42:21,979
I mean, who is this poet?

502
00:42:21,979 --> 00:42:25,179
He should be beaten up I think, first of all.

503
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:31,125
He was born out of a woman, and here he writes like this.

504
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:36,486
So you see, we like to take up something which is wrong,

505
00:42:36,772 --> 00:42:39,216
 which is absolutely absurd.

506
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:43,729
This comes because you are not wise.

507
00:42:44,057 --> 00:42:49,084
A wise person will take in whatever is the wisdom.

508
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:53,225
He won’t accept anything nonsensical.

509
00:42:53,355 --> 00:42:57,333
You go on reading the books one after another, one after another.

510
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:01,569
So many books you read, and where do you land up with that?

511
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:05,851
You find you are reading books which are no good for you,

512
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:10,518
 useless, but if you are fond of reading, you go on reading.

513
00:43:11,867 --> 00:43:19,732
So the lack of wisdom gives you indiscrimination

514
00:43:20,201 --> 00:43:23,772
and you justify it, all that you justify

515
00:43:23,797 --> 00:43:26,109
 and you say, "Now this is very good.

516
00:43:26,134 --> 00:43:28,460
Whatever I am doing is the best.”

517
00:43:28,485 --> 00:43:33,451
It’s not ego, I would say, but stupid human understanding.

518
00:43:33,975 --> 00:43:37,020
"Whatever I am doing is good.

519
00:43:37,045 --> 00:43:39,965
Whatever is my attitude is good.

520
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:44,900
How dare anybody tell me anything that this is wrong, that is wrong?"

521
00:43:45,049 --> 00:43:48,939
Everybody will laugh at that person, make fun of that person.

522
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,599
Such a person will suffer a lot, everything.

523
00:43:51,624 --> 00:43:56,769
But he will never accept that "I have done something wrong."

524
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:01,831
So when you go beyond dharmatit you become, go beyond dharma,

525
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:06,068
then what happens that dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

526
00:44:06,694 --> 00:44:11,244
You don’t do wrong things, you just don’t do it.

527
00:44:11,689 --> 00:44:15,107
It’s not that somebody is telling you or you want to follow it,

528
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,958
 or there is compulsion or you are disciplined,

529
00:44:17,983 --> 00:44:21,884
but you just don’t like to do wrong things, to say something

530
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:27,010
which is not respectful, which is not helpful, which is not loving.

531
00:44:27,271 --> 00:44:31,196
This is the quality of a Sahaja Yogi,

532
00:44:31,244 --> 00:44:33,966
where you become the Spirit.

533
00:44:34,191 --> 00:44:37,353
Becoming the Spirit, you don’t have to tell anybody,

534
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:41,116
so obvious, so evident and one can see that,

535
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:45,816
and the more you go deep into yourself, you find that

536
00:44:45,903 --> 00:44:51,500
you are endowed with such greatness within you,

537
00:44:51,525 --> 00:44:57,047
 such beautiful feelings, such nice things within you

538
00:44:57,072 --> 00:45:01,495
 that you overcome the ego of others.

539
00:45:01,654 --> 00:45:03,374
I must tell you a story.

540
00:45:03,399 --> 00:45:06,937
Once I went to see a saint.

541
00:45:07,132 --> 00:45:08,339
So the Sahaja Yogis said,

542
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,603
"Mother, You never go and see these gurus and this and that,

543
00:45:11,659 --> 00:45:13,994
so why do You go?"
I said, "You come along with Me."

544
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:15,518
So we had to climb a lot.

545
00:45:15,543 --> 00:45:17,495
I said, "From here you see his vibrations.

546
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,141
First you see his vibrations.”

547
00:45:19,648 --> 00:45:22,286
So lots of vibrations were coming.

548
00:45:22,311 --> 00:45:26,552
So we went up the hill, climbed up.

549
00:45:26,867 --> 00:45:31,600
And this gentleman was supposed to have powers

550
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:37,771
that he could control the rain, and it started raining,

551
00:45:37,882 --> 00:45:43,028
and raining very heavily,
and I got completely drenched in that rain.

552
00:45:43,149 --> 00:45:46,664
When I went up I saw him sitting on a stone,

553
00:45:46,689 --> 00:45:50,222
 just shaking his head with anger or I don’t know what.

554
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:53,590
So I went into his cave and sat down.

555
00:45:54,392 --> 00:45:59,637
So he came back, he came back and he said to Me,

556
00:45:59,662 --> 00:46:04,687
"Mother, why didn’t You allow me to stop the rain?

557
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:08,103
Is it to overcome my ego?"

558
00:46:08,128 --> 00:46:12,277
I said, "No, not that, I didn’t want,

559
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:16,997
 I didn’t see your ego anywhere; but the problem is the another.

560
00:46:17,163 --> 00:46:20,690
You are a sanyasi, you are a one who are an ascetic,

561
00:46:20,715 --> 00:46:22,355
you bought a sari for Me.

562
00:46:22,484 --> 00:46:26,958
Now if you bought a sari for Me,
 I can’t take from you because you’re a sanyasi.

563
00:46:26,983 --> 00:46:32,440
So I had to get drenched,
so that I will have to borrow sari from you."

564
00:46:32,465 --> 00:46:36,665
And the whole thing melted away.

565
00:46:36,888 --> 00:46:39,788
He became a very different person.

566
00:46:39,813 --> 00:46:44,866
So with wisdom you know how to handle different types of people.

567
00:46:44,952 --> 00:46:51,840
You say things by which you melt their ego.

568
00:46:52,005 --> 00:47:01,454
Their conditionings also are brought into a kind of a new awakening.

569
00:47:02,605 --> 00:47:08,656
They see in you that wisdom, that love, that expression of,

570
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,307
 I should say, your Spirit.

571
00:47:11,513 --> 00:47:18,446
And that’s how so many saints,
though they were tortured and troubled by many,

572
00:47:18,485 --> 00:47:23,769
 but they were definitely very much respected and loved.

573
00:47:24,183 --> 00:47:33,027
But those saints in those days, I must say,
were definitely very nice and good people,

574
00:47:33,135 --> 00:47:40,345
but one thing was there: they were rather strict
and disciplining with their disciples.

575
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:45,265
The reason was that they were not realized souls, their disciples,

576
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:50,864
and these gurus thought that “Unless and until
ou discipline these people,

577
00:47:50,975 --> 00:47:54,448
they’ll never rise, they’ll never become something great,

578
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:56,634
 so they have to be disciplined.”

579
00:47:56,659 --> 00:47:59,821
And those who were seekers of truth accepted

580
00:47:59,846 --> 00:48:03,468
that "All right, whatever you say, we’ll do.

581
00:48:03,572 --> 00:48:06,184
Even if you ask us to fast, we’ll do it.”

582
00:48:06,209 --> 00:48:09,038
They’ll stand on their heads, “All right, stand on our heads.

583
00:48:09,038 --> 00:48:12,363
Do what you say, and we will be willing to do it.

584
00:48:12,388 --> 00:48:14,952
You don’t have to worry on that point."

585
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:17,964
And that’s how they were very disciplining type.

586
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:21,469
But in Sahaja Yoga there is no discipline taught.

587
00:48:21,753 --> 00:48:25,044
The reason is, you are realized souls,

588
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:29,797
your Spirit is there and the Spirit gives you the light.

589
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:35,746
In that light you see yourself so clearly,
and you can discipline yourself.

590
00:48:35,848 --> 00:48:37,738
I don’t have to tell you.

591
00:48:37,763 --> 00:48:42,326
You know that so many people have given up drugs overnight,

592
00:48:42,366 --> 00:48:45,237
but I never told them, I never even talked about  drugs

593
00:48:45,262 --> 00:48:48,182
 or anything, and how did they do it?

594
00:48:48,207 --> 00:48:52,843
Because they had the light, and this is what is you have got today,

595
00:48:52,868 --> 00:48:55,157
 is the light of the Spirit.

596
00:48:55,221 --> 00:48:58,495
You become absolutely independent

597
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:02,503
and absolutely free; complete freedom,

598
00:49:02,551 --> 00:49:05,052
because you have the light.

599
00:49:05,163 --> 00:49:10,833
You cannot do, you cannot do wrong things.

600
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:16,339
Supposing now there is light,

601
00:49:16,879 --> 00:49:22,395
and there is some sort of a big explosion taking place.

602
00:49:22,622 --> 00:49:25,670
I won’t run towards the explosion, no.

603
00:49:25,741 --> 00:49:30,384
You won’t run either, because you have got the eyes.

604
00:49:30,409 --> 00:49:35,469
So the Spirit and its light is the greatest guiding factor

605
00:49:35,795 --> 00:49:40,342
by which you become, as I said, gunatit,

606
00:49:42,448 --> 00:49:48,609
you become kalatit, and you become dharmatit.

607
00:49:49,211 --> 00:49:51,515
You are not slave of anything.

608
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:55,285
You are not slave of your watch, you are not slave of time,

609
00:49:55,310 --> 00:50:00,446
you are not slave as to what is your gunas are.

610
00:50:00,572 --> 00:50:05,849
You don’t want to see whether
you are right-sided, left-sided or centered.

611
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:13,945
You are a Sahaja Yogi, and a Sahaja Yogi is beyond all these things,
so you are gunatit.

612
00:50:14,252 --> 00:50:18,601
You are dharmatit because dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

613
00:50:18,656 --> 00:50:23,307
You don’t have to follow any disciplining of dharma.

614
00:50:23,332 --> 00:50:29,341
I have seen in Sahaja Yoga, in some of the ashrams
they are very strict.

615
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:30,784
That should not be so.

616
00:50:30,809 --> 00:50:33,116
I have told them never to be strict.

617
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:37,495
If somebody doesn’t get up at, say, four o’clock, doesn’t matter.

618
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,798
Let him get up at ten o’clock.

619
00:50:39,873 --> 00:50:43,732
After some time he himself will get up at four,

620
00:50:43,765 --> 00:50:46,627
but don’t try to discipline them too much.

621
00:50:46,746 --> 00:50:49,766
Children also you should not discipline too much.

622
00:50:49,924 --> 00:50:54,760
Of course if they are realized souls, they themselves are so good,

623
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,257
 they are so beautiful.

624
00:50:56,282 --> 00:50:59,437
But if they are not, try to give them Realization.

625
00:50:59,462 --> 00:51:03,064
Once you realize that those who are not realized

626
00:51:03,128 --> 00:51:07,420
are making all these mistakes, that they are in the darkness,

627
00:51:07,445 --> 00:51:11,156
 your attitude towards them will change.

628
00:51:11,256 --> 00:51:15,845
You will just try to be extremely patient

629
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:20,297
and kind, and affectionate and loving,

630
00:51:20,362 --> 00:51:23,494
because you will know that person is not realized.

631
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:28,279
He has not got his eyes, he can’t see, he is blind,

632
00:51:28,304 --> 00:51:34,071
 he can’t hear, he can’t feel the reality.

633
00:51:34,332 --> 00:51:36,833
So first let him feel the reality.

634
00:51:36,858 --> 00:51:39,971
What is the use of giving him a lecture and disciplining?

635
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:45,176
Still he’ll go on making mistakes
and troubling himself, or troubling others.

636
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:47,515
So this is what you have achieved

637
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:52,540
through your enlightenment, that you are beyond all these things.

638
00:51:53,207 --> 00:51:57,035
And you become a person of a temperament

639
00:51:57,107 --> 00:52:02,971
which is so loving and so joy-giving.

640
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:08,663
I mean, it’s so many examples I can give in Sahaja Yoga
which has happened,

641
00:52:08,732 --> 00:52:13,542
that I have seen the beauty of their love and affection,

642
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:17,523
not only towards Me, but only towards others also.

643
00:52:17,548 --> 00:52:23,194
Only if it is only towards Me I can explain it,

644
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:28,553
 but I can’t explain the way they are kind to people,
as I told you yesterday,

645
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:30,805
 that these people went to Israel,

646
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:34,299
now they went to Egypt, they went to Russia.

647
00:52:34,324 --> 00:52:35,308
Who told them?

648
00:52:35,308 --> 00:52:37,684
I never asked anybody to go anywhere.

649
00:52:37,709 --> 00:52:41,250
On their own they felt they have to go  and do this job,

650
00:52:41,275 --> 00:52:46,809
 and they have to help people to get out of their ignorance.

651
00:52:48,122 --> 00:52:52,609
So today, on such a day when you are celebrating

652
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:57,505
My seventy-fifth Birthday, and so many balloons are there -

653
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:18,325
 they are very remarkably, very picturesque

654
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:24,012
and have colors of different types, expressing your love for Me.

655
00:53:25,356 --> 00:53:28,248
In everything I see your love.

656
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:32,700
Whatever you have done here, all your decorations, everything,

657
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:38,303
I feel My children are so loving.

658
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:43,761
I have done nothing for you,
I don’t know what makes you feel such gratitude.

659
00:53:43,904 --> 00:53:46,409
I still want to know, what have I done?

660
00:53:46,434 --> 00:53:47,940
I have done nothing!

661
00:53:47,965 --> 00:53:51,010
But the way you want to express your love,

662
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:55,497
 it’s very surprising; except for, I would say,

663
00:53:55,522 --> 00:54:00,182
that you got the light of your Spirit.

664
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:05,334
In that light, might be you see something different in Me,

665
00:54:06,406 --> 00:54:13,128
 but the way you are showing your gratitude is really beyond Me.

666
00:54:13,254 --> 00:54:16,149
As the other day, one of the speakers said that

667
00:54:16,174 --> 00:54:18,904
“You don’t thank your mother, take her for granted.”

668
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:20,009
It’s a fact.

669
00:54:20,182 --> 00:54:23,972
There’s no need to thank Me, you have to take Me for granted.

670
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:27,555
But the way you want to thank Me, just like a

671
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:32,741
small little child would like to thank, you just become like children.

672
00:54:32,988 --> 00:54:35,582
You’re so enthusiastic about it,

673
00:54:35,614 --> 00:54:41,940
and you don’t understand that
normally is not done like this anywhere;

674
00:54:42,035 --> 00:54:47,959
nobody tries to be just like children expressing
 their beautiful love.

675
00:54:48,401 --> 00:54:53,553
It’s a very new thing that one can see.

676
00:54:53,702 --> 00:54:59,260
Such peace, such love, such joy all around

677
00:54:59,554 --> 00:55:04,837
in a far-fetched place like this, how could you do that?

678
00:55:05,271 --> 00:55:07,080
How could you manage that?

679
00:55:07,405 --> 00:55:14,646
It’s not easy to understand,
 it’s not for human beings to see that.

680
00:55:15,334 --> 00:55:19,116
They just don’t understand how these people are like this,

681
00:55:19,156 --> 00:55:23,495
and why are they living like this so happily?

682
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:29,396
Now you have comforts in the house,
you are living so well in your houses,

683
00:55:29,547 --> 00:55:32,650
everything is there, but here in this scout-ground

684
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:35,440
 it’s not such a comfortable place to live.

685
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:38,446
But you can live anywhere, I know, I have seen it.

686
00:55:38,471 --> 00:55:41,604
Wherever you are, as long as there are Sahaja Yogis around,

687
00:55:41,652 --> 00:55:43,739
 you don’t care for anything.

688
00:55:43,764 --> 00:55:48,920
And this collective enjoyment of each other,

689
00:55:49,071 --> 00:55:52,443
without any expectation, without any criticism,

690
00:55:52,468 --> 00:55:57,488
without any gossip or any nonsense like that, is so beautiful.

691
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,775
And even when you pull each other’s legs,
you know, I enjoy your jokes

692
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:08,475
and understand that it’s such friendship,
such beautiful friendship.

693
00:56:08,593 --> 00:56:15,096
Whether you are from India or from England
or from America, or from any other place,

694
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:19,276
you find there’s such oneness of understanding,

695
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:25,527
 oneness of movement,  like one waves rises

696
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:29,182
 and another wave rises, and another wave rises.

697
00:56:29,207 --> 00:56:37,365
It’s continuous, eternal, and this is
what one has to achieve for others also.

698
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:43,112
For that also, must remember that
 you have the light; others don’t have.

699
00:56:43,158 --> 00:56:48,592
So you have to be very considerate, tolerant and understanding

700
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:53,463
about their problem, and just listen to them.

701
00:56:53,549 --> 00:56:54,876
What is their problem?

702
00:56:54,901 --> 00:56:59,768
First they’ll tell you that “My business is going down,”

703
00:56:59,824 --> 00:57:04,927
 or they might say that  “My wife is no good,”

704
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:09,773
 or “My son has no job, he is not working.”

705
00:57:09,808 --> 00:57:12,309
All kinds of things they might tell you.

706
00:57:12,334 --> 00:57:16,672
Listen, listen to them, for them it is important, all right.

707
00:57:16,697 --> 00:57:22,930
After that you will find gradually, you see,
 they’ll soothe down

708
00:57:23,058 --> 00:57:28,377
because you are emitting love,  you are emitting joy,

709
00:57:28,409 --> 00:57:35,037
you are emitting confidence through your spiritual awakening.

710
00:57:35,062 --> 00:57:37,716
You have those powers.

711
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:42,291
You just stand anywhere and you can create peace in that place,

712
00:57:42,316 --> 00:57:44,938
you can create happiness in that place.

713
00:57:44,989 --> 00:57:51,343
So be confident, don’t lose your confidence.

714
00:57:51,494 --> 00:57:58,586
Also your wisdom to understand others will be very much convincing

715
00:57:58,611 --> 00:58:03,297
for other people to understand that
“They are something exceptional.

716
00:58:03,376 --> 00:58:06,612
They don’t get angry, they don’t get into temper,

717
00:58:06,668 --> 00:58:10,512
they are not mad people,
 they are not after some sort of a craze -

718
00:58:10,537 --> 00:58:14,945
just very, very balanced people."

719
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:17,734
And this you don’t have to practice.

720
00:58:17,759 --> 00:58:19,054
It is there.

721
00:58:19,093 --> 00:58:22,404
It is within you, and you should be proud of it.

722
00:58:22,763 --> 00:58:28,103
You should not think that it is something

723
00:58:28,191 --> 00:58:33,465
that you have to achieve, or to become.

724
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:36,213
You have it, within yourself you have it.

725
00:58:36,238 --> 00:58:41,858
Only thing that you have to see in the light of the Spirit yourself.

726
00:58:43,246 --> 00:58:48,569
It just is a very simple thing, and that works out.

727
00:58:49,023 --> 00:58:53,338
It is not easy for others to understand you,

728
00:58:53,457 --> 00:58:56,529
but it should be very easy to understand them;

729
00:58:56,554 --> 00:58:59,464
because you were like that before,

730
00:58:59,489 --> 00:59:06,808
and now they are seeing you and they will become like you.

731
00:59:07,683 --> 00:59:09,250
It’s very simple.

732
00:59:09,275 --> 00:59:13,874
You can see this, that I started Sahaja Yoga with one lady.

733
00:59:13,899 --> 00:59:16,337
And now today, see how many are there.

734
00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:19,778
Now what have I done, I really don’t know, what have I done?

735
00:59:19,778 --> 00:59:21,850
I have no idea.

736
00:59:21,883 --> 00:59:26,355
And what you think, such gratitude and enjoyment and joy!

737
00:59:27,204 --> 00:59:30,005
So all these things, whatever I have told you,

738
00:59:30,236 --> 00:59:35,777
 you have to be aware of your being,  of your own Self,

739
00:59:35,825 --> 00:59:41,045
 of your Spirit, that you are the Spirit.

740
00:59:41,281 --> 00:59:46,652
And as you are the Spirit, you are beyond all these things.

741
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:53,367
And once that happens, you’ll be amazed what a personality you are.

742
00:59:53,827 --> 01:02:46,638
(Shri Mataji continues in Hindi)
