00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,040

00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,840
Beautiful place.

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,640
What a beautiful place, ha? Beautiful place,

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,240
under the sky.

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,840
You all have a ride, is it?

20
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,480
Nice shady place also.

21
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,960
Hello, yes, You are playing? Did you go on the river?

22
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,680
How can you all be sitting there, it's so muddy!

23
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,960
Come down Michael

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,720
Aah!

25
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,680
Is that a nest?

26
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,359
No, that's a dead branch, Mother. Just a dead branch hanging down.

27
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,280
Looks a little bit like mistletoe.

28
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,560
Yogi: There is quite a lot of mistletoe on the trees all around here.

29
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,760
This is the eucalyptus, you see.

30
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Hmmm!

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,160
These are Gum nuts? Yes, there are the flowers and then they become nuts.

32
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,160
The one we saw... these are the same?

33
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,000
Yogi: The same flowers that you saw in, where was it Adelaide.

34
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,360
The ones which are like Ganesha's flowers?

35
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,720
Yogi Yes, yes, yes, Mother.

36
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,640
With the four petals? Yogi: Yes, but it had a much bigger base.

37
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,840
Let Me see. Yogi: Much fatter base.

38
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,079
Yogi: They're all different shapes and sizes but the one we saw had-

39
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,440
definitely had four sections on it.

40
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,480
No, these are those different thing which has eyes sort of thing.

41
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,200
Is that the one?

42
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,120
Yogi: That was a banksia nut, actually, Mother, I think

43
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,200
He? Y:That was a banksia nut the one that you got little naps made.

44
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,320
That was in Perth.

45
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,359
Which may be had got four little slices in

46
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,320
Yes, yes, that was another one.

47
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,600
That was just like Ganesha.

48
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,960
Yogi: Western Australia is famous for that flower.

49
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,200
Great!

50
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,280
Yogi: In fact in the spring time after the rains

51
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,280
Yogi: Western Australia is just a blaze of wild flowers.

52
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,200
It's famous all over the world for that.

53
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,440
These are six, you see..ha... six.

54
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,320
Yes, these are six.

55
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,640
So, these are more Swadisthana I should say.

56
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,000
The fragrance is different from what we get in our eucalyptus.

57
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,120
Yogi: It's a whole, it's a whole range of fragrances.

58
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,280
Many, there is lemon scented and peppermint and

59
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,560
I think the one which is that, is Indian.

60
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,200
Can you get a leaf out of that? Let's see have a look.

61
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,359
Yogi: I think they are bringing You a selection of leaves, Mother.

62
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,640
Many eucalyptus here.

63
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,680
Children are very happy

64
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,800
They're so full of joy, children, just look.

65
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,039
Yogi: They've all been down in the mud, in the river.

66
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,120
Come along. He?

67
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,680
Look at them, look at the children.

68
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,760
How they feel one good nature immediately.

69
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,920
Thank you. This too has six.

70
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,360
They are so rich, I tell you.

71
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,960
Yogi: They make a lot of eucalyptus oil from these.

72
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:54,440
Yeah. But I feel our eucalyptus is very strong, Indian way.

73
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,840
It's smelling not so strong.

74
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,599
It's more the chlorophyll than eucalyptus oil in it.

75
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,200
Yogi: Some of these varieties are not so strong.

76
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,000
Yogi: It's the same I think that one, Mother, it is not a strong one.

77
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,080
Yogi: There are no lemon scented ones around at all?

78
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,239
This this one yeah, this is..

79
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,880
This is a willow. This is a weeping willow I think.

80
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,200
Yogini: No, it's not weeping type of gum but has no scent at all.

81
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,120
Yogini: The lemon scented one looks similar to that but

82
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,280
has beautiful smell of lemon about, (...)

83
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,560
Oh, this doesn't have.

84
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,159
But it has, not that it does not - but very faint.

85
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,560
I think on the whole India has got great quality of...

86
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,720
Yogi: Perfume, trees, flowers.

87
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,360
...flower, everything, you see even chandan is grown there

88
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,760
and once I talked to a lady

89
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,400
a Japanese lady, I said I enjoy Japanese garden.

90
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,320
She said, "But it doesn't have the perfume that You have in India."

91
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,079
Yes that's true.  Hm. We have trees with these Parijatakas and all.

92
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,880
Why don't you bring next time when you come that Parijataka?

93
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,760
Is a good idea

94
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,000
Very small flower, you must have seen, with a red stem.

95
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,760
Parijataka. This time I'll show you, if it is there.

96
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,560
We have so many scented flowers in our country.

97
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,720
One of them is this of course.

98
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,199
But we have another one which we call as Mogra -

99
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,040
It comes during summer. You can bring all these.

100
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,680
Yogi: From India?

101
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,720
Yogi: Yes, they should grow here too.

102
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,200
Yes, there's another one called Bakula. Bakula is a -

103
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,920
it looks like more like a wood like thing,

104
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,800
a little, little flower is there.

105
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,880
but it's a huge big tree and the whole place gets filled up with them

106
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,960
We have so many like that.

107
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,319
If they allow you to bring - do they?

108
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,040
Yogi: Well they don't but we could,

109
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,560
if we use it discriminately, I think, it would be alright.

110
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,880
We just hide it away in our bags.

111
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,480
I mean they are not, there's no danger with them. It's just that

112
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,959
some people bring some dangerous seeds in and

113
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,080
they become pests or become a source of infection.

114
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,280
Yogi: This is the type of trees, Mother, that are used for timber.

115
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,560
Yogi: Very, very straight.

116
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,880
But this is a very light, light wood, very light wood.

117
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,120
Yogi: No, no itâ€™s a hardwood actually. Is it?

118
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,880
(...) Yogi: Heavy, heavy, wet hard wood.

119
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,480
Alright, in India you don't get that hard one.

120
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,840
Yogi: In fact it's so hard that it won't take a nail easily.

121
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
Hmm, that's great!

122
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,160
This is another variety. What we get is just a waste, you see.

123
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,880
Yogi: Mother would you like a coke or something?

124
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,560
I'll have little chana first,

125
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,640
then I'll drink a little water. Yogi: Coke?

126
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,720
Yesterday was a good day.

127
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,440
Yogi: You missed the great program. Hmm. Amazing.

128
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,840
Did you hear about it? What happened?

129
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,839
Yogi:Yes Mother, we've been questioning people all morning about it,

130
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,800
the events of the last few days.

131
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,680
Tremendous! Yogi: Tremendous Mother!

132
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,400
We have got rid of the evil effect of Mr. Terence

133
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,360
and he's out for ever and ever.

134
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,960
And I have to tell all of you who are leaders -

135
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,960
I was telling yesterday - now we have to take very mild ways.

136
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,800
Specially the leaders have to be extremely mild.

137
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,920
They should not be strict, they should not get angry,

138
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,960
they should not shout.

139
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,400
But a very patronizing way should be,

140
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,720
because that's the way they can appeal to people.

141
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,320
All the time getting angry or disciplining is not a good thing

142
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,920
and judging others as what he did and then he started on jumping.

143
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,040
First he started judging others, correcting others then

144
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,080
on firmer grounds and firmer grounds

145
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,720
and also I think he did not allow

146
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,880
it to spread to other places because he wanted to control.

147
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,720
See this is the main thing for that.

148
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,640
Yogi: Yes, he wanted it in one place.

149
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,280
Yogini: It's apple juice for you personally.

150
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,760
Yogi: Even that was partly the reason why

151
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,720
the ashram at Morunga failed, Mother because

152
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,360
he basically didn't want it to be.

153
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,239
Yes he has had a very influence on everyone, very bad influence.

154
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,360
He had an influence, but of a very bad nature

155
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,280
and egoistical people

156
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,439
were charmed by this thing some time

157
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,760
and they don't try to get it off.

158
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,040
But one must learn a lesson now,

159
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,200
that all kinds of egos must be dropped.

160
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,120
Now he's dropped out of Sahaja Yoga, he and his wife permanent,

161
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,360
they have nothing to do, nothing to do.

162
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,560
The amount of damage he's done to Sahaja yoga, you can't imagine.

163
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,760
So many people came in the party,

164
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:06,680
I mean in the hall up to the, up to the dais and told Me

165
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,360
that because of Warren they left Sahaja Yoga.

166
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Yogi: Because of Terence.

167
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,719
I mean because of Terence. I still combine you with him.

168
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,439
You see he was so much identified and

169
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,960
he just used My name and his name (...)

170
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,000
Yogi: Yes, he did, Mother.

171
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,520
A very nasty fellow.

172
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,240
Very rotten person, rotten to the core in the way he behaved.

173
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,560
Did they tell you?

174
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,079
Very shameful to behave like that.

175
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,360
And I too telephoned to his father-in-law

176
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,959
and the father-in-law told Me they are very ashamed of themselves

177
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,160
and this that. I said this is a permanent feature now.

178
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,120
You do what you like and then just to say sorry. Nothing doing,

179
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,560
now we are not going to have any more of that.

180
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,720
And she's a liar. She's told him lots of stories, she made a big

181
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,440
thing out of him as if he was something special.

182
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,880
She was a - not at all.

183
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,520
In India she's not regarded as even a sahaja yogini.

184
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,000
So many people don't think her to be a sahaja yogini.

185
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:19,040
She was out of Sahaja yoga for five years for misbehaving!

186
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,600
And she thinks no end of herself.

187
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,760
This dream and all those business you should all

188
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,880
forget these nonsensical things that she told you.

189
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,200
That this is a dream we are having and dream they came and told Me..

190
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,439
Cary I'm rather worried because you have been

191
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,840
with that horrible fellow - better beat him with shoes every day.

192
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,640
Can you go and do it now, nicely?

193
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,320
Horrible fellow!

194
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,079
Actually I never thought him anything good much,

195
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,040
but Mr. Warren was rather anxious that he should be pulled in within

196
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,080
and then I said that Warren is your leader.

197
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,839
He said you should also take the name of Terence.

198
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,200
I never thought him to be something good.

199
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,960
But it was a nice thing that he came down

200
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,960
and everybody could see him he was exposed

201
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,800
and that's how he got into his problem.

202
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,960
Yogi: That's just the idea Mother, that's why Hmm.

203
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,560
I wanted him to go away. So everybody

204
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,880
could see it, not just Sydney ashram or Melbourne or something.

205
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,160
Very ego-oriented.

206
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,959
Has done nothing for Sahaja yoga, nothing so far.

207
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,599
So many marriages he's broken,

208
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,800
so many people he's talked to so rudely, isn't it?

209
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,640
And some of them are not willing to come back

210
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,440
because of this.

211
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,760
He said horrible things you know.

212
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,960
Maybe your wife also, maybe one of them, I don't know.

213
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,120
Just find out.

214
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,680
Christine told Me that it is he who created a problem for her.

215
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Phil and Christine took to that ego behavior.

216
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,679
Yogi: Christine mainly.

217
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,800
He? Yogi: Christine mainly huh?

218
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,400
Not only Christine.

219
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,760
Yesterday Michelle's mother - Michelle's mother is here?

220
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,080
She said that

221
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,440
her husband is not willing to come to Sahaja Yoga anymore

222
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,040
- she is there.

223
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,520
She told Me the same thing. So many of them.

224
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,040
He is very dangerous. He's got married by that.

225
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:04,280
(...) he's got a good father-in-law whom he can lynch very well.

226
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,960
Come along.

227
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,960
But then I had to declare.

228
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:37,360
But one lady who was there, who was a reporter,

229
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,360
she reacted very strongly and we have to now deal with that

230
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,600
on Monday or Tuesday perhaps, Tuesday morning.

231
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,320
She's coming to see Me.

232
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,159
It's terrible!

233
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,040
Better now - much better.

234
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,760
Hmm! That's it, that is him.

235
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,160
Give him bandhan - useless fellow.

236
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,760
I think best is to give yourself a bandhan

237
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,120
so that he doesn't attack you -

238
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,640
Some sort of a cancer I think.

239
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,560
Yogi: Like the false gurus Mother,

240
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,800
it won't be easy to get them out of the brain.

241
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,760
You should beat them with shoes.

242
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,480
You have to put Me in your brain, first of all,

243
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,240
just put Me in your brain.

244
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,360
Just say: "Mother, You are in my brain", that's all.

245
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,080
That's the mantra.

246
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,280
Mother,  Seven times.

247
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,120
Just say that seven times.

248
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,679
Yogis: Mother, You are in my brain.

249
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,320
Yogis: Mother, You are in my brain.

250
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,800
Yogis: Mother, You are in my brain.

251
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,240
Yogis: Mother, You are in my brain.

252
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,960
Yogis: Mother, You are in my brain.

253
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,399
Yogis: Mother, You are in my brain.

254
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,760
Yogis: Mother, You are in my brain.

255
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,840
Hmm! Nirvichara.

256
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,200
You've better eyes.

257
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,280
Ha! It is working  Yogi: Yes everything has gone peaceful

258
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,600
Good?

259
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,680
So now Warren is coming with Me and who else is coming?

260
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,720
Yogi: Mathew's going and.

261
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,000
Yogi: Mathew and Albert.

262
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,720
Albert is going.

263
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,800
So,

264
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,520
and we are going to fix up for our next trip to India.

265
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,440
I may not be able to come next year, I don't know

266
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,840
whatever is the situation because

267
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,480
I'm going to be rather busy building up ashrams for you

268
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,240
to have in India.

269
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,880
So I don't know what will be the situation next year.

270
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,159
But in any case you all are coming

271
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,320
and we are thinking of making it one month and one month.

272
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,720
So, some people who want to come in this month

273
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,840
can come in first month and others in second month.

274
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,280
And

275
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,960
that will reduce pressure because we'll be having more people now.

276
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,040
And these trips also may come to an end, after some time.

277
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,360
Because it's, you know it's very difficult

278
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,159
to manage the whole stuff with so many people going

279
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,640
and I think you are very much uncomfortable also.

280
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,640
Now, huh?

281
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,320
Yogi: What... touring with You, Mother?

282
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,879
We've talked about it a number of times and said that most of us

283
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,320
have felt that the most enjoyable part of the tour

284
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,879
apart from, of course, the beautiful climax in Delhi,

285
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,600
was round Maharashtra and, You know,

286
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,560
we all seem to recall affectionately that

287
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,200
the buses and the dust and the moving

288
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,440
but we did miss that, Mother, when we got to Delhi.

289
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,560
There was a great joy in meeting those people

290
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,600
and sharing the programs.

291
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,360
I can take you to a dense forest this time if you want but

292
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,720
the thing is in one month we'll have to do Maharashtra.

293
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,840
Three weeks it will be Maharashtra and one week will be lapping,

294
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,240
overlapping each other- like that you know - about what - oh no,

295
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,639
four weeks will be in Maharashtra, one week in Delhi overlapping

296
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,560
for about 2-3 days, if you want to get married or all sort of things.

297
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,160
So, we can have about 3 days overlapping.

298
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,280
Yogi: So, it will be 4 weeks tour and 1 week overlapping.

299
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,160
Now 1 week overlap,

300
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,760
we can't have so many people in Delhi, you see, double group.

301
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,520
Yogi: No, seems impossible.

302
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,840
Impossible. So what we can do: you can have a group of people

303
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,960
will go from here for one week in Delhi

304
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,200
and the others will be coming for another week in Delhi.

305
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,800
But in between you can have 3 days,

306
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,720
3 days which could be overlap.

307
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,280
Only 3 days could be easier.

308
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,760
Yogi: Maybe 1 group could stay in the temple or something like that.

309
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,959
One group can stay in the temple for 2 nights, it's alright.

310
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,360
Yogi: Also those that had to go home early

311
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,560
could always leave from Bombay again and go back.

312
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,000
If they could only stay for 1 month. Yes, yes.

313
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,800
Yogi: So they don't have to come to Delhi for the extra week.

314
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,600
Yes, those who want to come to Delhi can come otherwise they need not

315
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,720
because Delhi will be mostly you will be staying with other people

316
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,320
and not with there with sahaja yogis also

317
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,159
Isn't it? That's a good idea

318
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,640
because you enjoyed it very much

319
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,879
Yogi: That was the best part of Delhi, Mother.

320
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,080
After Your program that was the...

321
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,520
That was a thing you all enjoyed.

322
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,240
So we'll have 100 people for the first week

323
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,840
and 100 people, first month and hundred for the next.

324
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,560
Because this time it was 140 together was too much.

325
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,840
So we'll have two.

326
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,360
Yogi: Sahaja yoga's leaders of the world will start battling,

327
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,520
Mother, I imagine any time now for their quota.

328
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,879
Yogi: The only problem with all this, Mother, is

329
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,159
You're going to have to be in two places at once.

330
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,760
Yeah! that I'll have to.

331
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,640
Two months I can give for all this -

332
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,000
always been two months there, so we can manage with two months.

333
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,360
But then we'll not have many programs in Bombay.

334
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:10,720
And the 15 days or 15 and 3, 17 days, 18 days, I'll be in Delhi.

335
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,720
So we can have 18 days program in Delhi.

336
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:21,720
In Bombay, we can have about 3 days here and a 3 days here.

337
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,160
That we have to adjust.

338
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,680
Any other suggestions you have?

339
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,120
Yogi: People could start working on the assumption that

340
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,720
they'll be going about what time - about Christmas time? Yes.

341
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,120
Yogi: Before christmas Mother? Before christmas.

342
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,480
Yogi: Just before christmas?

343
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,040
Easy to arrange like that.

344
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,800
So that it will be January and February

345
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,560
and we are again back in March.

346
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,719
Is she crying? Which one?

347
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,320
Yogi: That's the other one.

348
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,120
Yogi: Has anyone got any suggestions or anything that... Yah,

349
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,919
Mother is just asking any ideas that they want to

350
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,959
put up about the trip in India?

351
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Don't be shy.

352
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,800
Y: Could we make a visit to a silk mill to see how sarees are woven?

353
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,280
Y: Can we have a visit to a silk mill to see how sarees are woven?

354
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,880
For that you have to go to  Banares

355
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,520
to see the sarees woven.

356
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,840
That's done in Banares, most of these silk sarees.

357
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,520
You don't find them in Delhi or anything but ..

358
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,200
Yogi: One in Dhulia, we saw some in Dhulia we saw sarees being woven

359
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,240
Yogi: but they were cheaper ones. Yes, cheaper sarees

360
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,080
but for these special intricate ones, you see, which are whole silk,

361
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,320
mostly you can find cotton ones being made here but not silk.

362
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,840
But this fellow who gave you dhotis

363
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,159
you can go to his place and see.

364
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,879
Yogi: If we can bring the trunk? Can you bring it over, Mother can give those things out now?[UNCLEAR]

365
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,760
Yogi: Get a couple of people to help you.

366
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,640
What about the presents that Tumal has sent for you?

367
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,399
Yogi: They haven't arrived, 25th they'll arrive.

368
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,959
Very sad!

369
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,600
Yogi: Did You see them all, Mother? Mother: Huh You saw them?

370
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,320
Oh, nice things!

371
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,960
We brought it with such love for you, just what a shame!

372
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,240
Really.

373
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,200
So what about your ordering for the

374
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,879
juice we were saying? Juice machine or something?

375
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,840
Yogi: Ah, somebody is looking into it more carefully.

376
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,360
Mr. Pai was the only one who did it in Bombay.

377
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,040
I want somebody else who knows a little bit more about it.

378
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:28,120
They cost about from about 1500 up to about 3000.

379
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,439
3000 for a bigger one, which has capacity to roll about

380
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,679
four or five stalks at once. That's a better one.

381
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,000
But I want to wait now until we get Queensland open because

382
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,720
the cane does not begin until the North coast of New South Wales.

383
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,640
So only when we get Brisbane open should we start that project.

384
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,920
That's a very good idea. Yogi: There's no cane down in this area.

385
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,840
That will be, maybe a next year project now.

386
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,080
Mother, should we start up Brisbane ourselves in the next few months

387
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,040
Yes, yes you should start. Is alright.

388
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,440
Yogi: I was wondering [UNCLEAR] Albert, is he here, he might like to....?

389
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,760
Oh, you get lot of people from other cults coming.

390
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,520
That would be the problem and maybe you might feel it rather

391
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,920
embarrassing. But take it slowly and tell them that

392
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,159
"see now, you have to give up your gurus. We have no quarrel nothing

393
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,919
but we can't work out with your gurus, so please give up."

394
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,800
Yogi: We could say, start gently up there and do it too

395
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,280
Yeah! Yogi: ...slowly..

396
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,720
Yogi: Have the dhoties been torn up in the two pieces?

397
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,080
Yogi: No they haven't Yogi: We could do that.

398
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,800
Yes. So how are we going to distribute it?

399
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,320
Yogi: I think they will just have to be very common sensical about it

400
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,560
because there are not enough for everybody.

401
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,800
If you had told Me I would have

402
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,399
asked him to put some more. But how many did not get the dhoties?

403
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,480
Yogi: All the men that didn't get dhoties put your hands up.

404
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,320
The ones that did not get the dhoties.

405
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,720
Just put your hand up. Oh! it's not many, very few.

406
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,840
Must be some of them who are cooking - just find out from them.

407
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,120
Yogi: The three men who are cooking, they were in India, they would have had theirs

408
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,800
They must have had, alright.

409
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,160
So now how many did not get? Please raise your hands.

410
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,639
Ah, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. eight.

411
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,280
So we have to have four dhoties.

412
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,320
So for two persons, these are for two persons.

413
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,600
Yogi: Come on and get them, quickly.

414
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,400
I think they are even better, so let's give these first.

415
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,040
They are better quality, these are better quality.

416
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,480
For two persons, this is for two persons.

417
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,640
Yogi: We tear it in half. Yes, exactly.

418
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,760
Yogi: Is that two, is that two or one? Yes, two, these are two.

419
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,320
These are all two, these are two either.

420
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,279
These are two definitely, now so you two can share

421
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,360
and you two can share.

422
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,319
So you need four - we have four. Now this one two can share there

423
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,560
and two can share here. Alright, let us give these first of all.

424
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,400
Now two more - again you come back, I think, let's have it.

425
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,239
Now one each. You two have, too, alright?

426
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,639
You haven't got it too? Alright.

427
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,720
Give it back, give Me that, give it back. Other one, the other one.

428
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,480
See. Alright!

429
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,359
Now you have these two

430
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,120
because, you see just you had. You have got two?

431
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,320
Alright, you have two now, let's see.

432
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,960
We'll find out one for him. So now how many?

433
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,919
One - now take out one.

434
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,680
Yogi: Has anyone who got one, lost it or [UNCLEAR]

435
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,920
Alright, now what I'm saying we have to give two each

436
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,400
in any case so you take this one.

437
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,279
Alright, now you do one thing with - take out these - one

438
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:38,920
How many they are? These are also two each - two, three, four,

439
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,040
five.

440
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,439
So it's, alright, now I don't know,

441
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,640
let Me see what's written in there, if they are two or one.

442
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,359
What's written here?

443
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,560
I think it is - it is for two. Yes.

444
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,040
So now, two of you should again come.

445
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,200
Now he's got two so you, you come along and this set -

446
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,200
you should have one of that and one of that, alright?

447
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,200
May God bless you!

448
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,720
Now you come along again - you have one of that, it's two again.

449
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,160
Now who else? Come along, you people come along also.

450
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,759
One each, one of this and one of that. One more group here.

451
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,160
Mother, would it be a good idea

452
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,920
if we all wore dhoties to the puja tomorrow?

453
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,040
Good idea, very very good idea, you wash them.

454
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,879
Have we, have I given to all of you two each now? He hasn't got.

455
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,920
Yes you have got. Now so

456
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,240
Yogi: You need another one? See, he didn't follow.

457
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,480
Just tell him what it is. See these are to be divided into four

458
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,720
and one each you have to take.

459
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,240
Yogi: Everyone should have a different one, so you take two,

460
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,680
one of each.

461
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:23,600
You never got one... Alright, give it to them

462
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,960
Yogi: A real paddle steamer!

463
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,880
Y: I don't see him. Oh look Mother, coming up the river!

464
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,080
Y: It's a paddle steamer Mother, it's...

465
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,360
We saw this yesterday in the picture.

466
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,200
Same thing.

467
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,400
Yogi: Wonderful! Get the film on it

468
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,200
(...)  Now how many is that? One

469
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Now how many did not get these?

470
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,320
Yogi: How many did not get these shawls? Quite a few

471
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,800
How many? No, not the ladies - gents.

472
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,759
Not the ladies - gents. Yogi: How many men did not get the shawl?

473
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,279
Yogi: One - keep your hands up so we can count.

474
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,560
Yogi: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

475
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,640
Yogi: Eleven. Alright, Mother: now take out the sarees.

476
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:12,479
five

477
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:22,640
six

478
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,960
How many ladies did not get the sarees?

479
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,359
One, two Yogi: One, two

480
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,279
Yogi: Keep your hands up, please, it would be impossible. 1, 2, 3

481
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,640
Yogi: four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

482
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,040
Yogi: thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

483
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,240
Alright, exact.

484
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,520
Alright, let's have. One by one, come along.

485
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,160
From the little girls - first of all the younger girls come along.

486
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,320
The blue one. It's alright, it's alright.

487
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:30,040
One. Which one you - this is for bigger girls.

488
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,760
Yogi: Let the little girls come first. [UNCLEAR] this first of all.

489
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,560
Little Girls we can do.

490
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,120
One...

491
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,040
Now, for the big girls.

492
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,400
One of - one by one you should come here. Come along.

493
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,799
May God bless you! Now first

494
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,520
First Yogi: There's another little girl Mother

495
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,439
Ah! little girl. Now see you're small, it's pink we'll give that.

496
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,680
This is good for you.

497
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,879
Now who else? Come along.

498
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,040
Y: Let the people that have never had sarees before let come first.

499
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,840
All of them will have the first you see. Y:Mother itâ€™s my first saree

500
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,640
Y:Thank you Mother, it's my first saree.

501
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,560
Is it?

502
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,000
Alright, come along. I think you come along, come along.

503
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,080
We have. Now how many more?

504
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,480
It's good idea.

505
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,800
One for you, come.

506
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,479
Sally you have a saree? She has, alright.

507
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,200
Now how many ladies are left out? Raise your hands.

508
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,760
One, two three, four

509
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,480
five - stand up, stand up together I would like to see.

510
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,440
Alright, so we'll give these - not these - not that.

511
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,760
Come along. For the ladies.

512
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,760
Is good, you can wrap your children also - both of them are married.

513
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,480
Hmm! Two

514
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,400
Three,

515
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,560
four,

516
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,440
five. Come along.

517
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,280
Exact, see.

518
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,560
[UNCLEAR] what do you say to that?

519
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,480
Come along. seven

520
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,399
Yeah! now we'll give her this [UNCLEAR]

521
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,960
This is just a blouse - you have a saree?

522
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,520
Now, I think, you better give her because she has a saree

523
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,680
- you can give her.

524
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,319
Yogi: Joyan has a saree Mother - she's got lots of sarees.

525
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,720
First [UNCLEAR]

526
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,560
Joyan can have this. Yogi: She's got lots.

527
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,600
Joyan you can have a blouse piece.

528
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,880
You can have blouse piece, alright.

529
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,479
Now, this is for a little girl.

530
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,680
Is there any little girl here? Come along.

531
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,280
It's good, so she can make her a

532
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,560
petticoat of this color - good idea.

533
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,960
Ah!

534
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,399
Now what is that?

535
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,040
That's [UNCLEAR]

536
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,880
That's a puja cloth. Yogi: Yeah, that was used for puja.

537
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,520
Yogi: This was bought for puja but not used

538
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,960
This to be kept.

539
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,680
Yogi: It was not used.

540
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
What is it?

541
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,080
Y: I think Mother that's- I was just trying to work out which ...

542
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,760
Yes, there are small children. How many there are?

543
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,920
They're quite a lot.

544
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,440
Yogis: Lots everywhere. 20 Mother. Annh?

545
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,840
20.................

546
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,640
Yogi: Loaves and fishes, Mother. Hmm.

547
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,040
This one is - now one is left out.

548
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,640
So, who's the gentleman who hasn't got it?

549
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,680
Yogi: Michael, did you get one?

550
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,919
Yogi: Where is he?

551
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,560
Yogi: Did Michael get one?

552
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,400
Where is he? Does he want one? Yogi: He'll be back. I'll give it to him later Mother.

553
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,600
This one I think you should keep for puja.

554
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,360
This one for Michael.

555
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,160
Oh! you must wash it, it's not clean. You have to wash them.

556
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,759
Tonight you have to go and wash them for tomorrow

557
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,680
or you can wear the inside one may be clean

558
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,560
- just see the inside ones, may be clean.

559
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,320
These are all clean ones, these are very clean - these you can use.

560
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,880
You see, you better use these first - these are all clean ones.

561
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,360
These are very clean.

562
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,520
Yogi: I said they should wear the dhoties tomorrow, Mother.

563
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,080
I should have said puja on monday

564
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,280
They'll all be turning up to the public program in their dhoties.

565
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,640
It'll be very interesting.

566
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,840
Ian has got his dhoti? Yogi: I think so.

567
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,359
You got Ian? Your dhoti have you got?

568
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,759
Yogi: Yes Mother, I have got [UNCLEAR]

569
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,520
What's the problem?

570
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,000
Yogi: Ian says it's getting him into it that's the problem. Why?

571
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,800
Yogi: Make it a clear instruction, Mother then it's done

572
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,640
It's a - you don't know how to wear it - should I show you?

573
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,319
Now any man, come along. Tear off a dhoti - half.

574
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,800
Yogi: Is there, has anybody got a pair of scissors or a sharp knife?

575
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,760
You see, you have to wear something short inside

576
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,240
- you see you can't just wear

577
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,240
the dhoti or you can wear a short pant will do.

578
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,960
First let Me show how the dhoti is

579
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,280
Let Me do - it's, it's straightforward you can just tear it off, Yogi: stand up

580
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,480
Come along, let him come, I'll show you.

581
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:10,520
Now, come here.

582
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,279
Now,

583
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,360
hold it in double

584
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,560
here - make it a double around. Complete. Double it that side

585
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,760
Yogis: [UNCLEAR] tuck it in ........

586
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,279
[UNCLEAR] now

587
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,240
Yogi: You just

588
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,960
Just stand, yes do it like that, alright.

589
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:40,359
Now, now can you see that clearly.

590
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,839
Now stand facing that side.

591
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,080
Now here at this point you've to pull out two things like that

592
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,640
like this, alright, for a knot.

593
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,520
Now you have to keep a big knot like this alright

594
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,960
and to make it a strong knot you have to change over

595
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,720
and now give it a knot -

596
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,440
so that the knot never opens out easily.

597
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,520
This kind of a knot is called as (.....). Imagine.

598
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:25,600
[UNCLEAR]

599
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,680
Now it will not open, Alright.

600
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,160
So, then what you have to do

601
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,759
you should take one side just like that.

602
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,279
Now, if you want to wear like Shri Krishna

603
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,759
or if you want to wear like - depends on -

604
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,520
put it the whole thing out like that, come along

605
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,720
like this. Now turn around.

606
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:59,799
Now, you have to push this one here. Just push one side here.

607
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,960
One is done like this, alright

608
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,879
and the another side, this side is picked up

609
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,319
as this - this is Shri Krishna's style.

610
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,200
Alright. And now take it in your hand like that

611
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,600
and you have to push the whole thing in there.

612
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:23,200
So the whole thing is tucked in and you have a nice dress.

613
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,560
Pull here and the sides like that

614
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,879
See this is [UNCLEAR] Now you push this [UNCLEAR]

615
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:32,600
[UNCLEAR]

616
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,640
Now, take it out

617
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,080
now on this side you should

618
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,920
the whole thing I've pushed it in, alright

619
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,240
and just push it a little bit on the sides so you don't show your legs.

620
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,879
Yogi: That side?

621
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,160
You follow that?

622
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,560
Alright, that's too much.

623
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,640
Did I do it very fast?

624
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,960
[UNCLEAR] now stand up

625
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,680
[UNCLEAR]

626
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,280
Some people take it too much inside with some too little. Whatever style you like

627
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,680
Okay tie it up.

628
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,439
Alright, beautiful now, you have to take

629
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,319
careful to let it wait so when you sit down

630
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,759
you'll be comfortable - now sit down and see if it is comfortable.

631
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,960
Yes, you must have something to wear

632
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,120
[UNCLEAR]

633
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,600
You sit down.

634
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,920
Annh?

635
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,400
Yes, you can cross, everything. It's very comfortable.

636
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,080
Yogi: Fix it, Mother. Just tuck one in, ah.

637
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,280
It's the left hand-side has to be balanced.

638
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,960
Now, can you make a small again

639
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,640
Now take the other one in a different way.

640
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,280
Now the flair is made here,

641
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,080
the whole thing is made Yogi: The front first Yes.

642
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,480
Starts from here.

643
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,520
This has to go inside, you see, that's the main point.

644
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,040
Yogi: This this loose end goes inside like that

645
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,920
it goes inside like that and now

646
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,200
you need to come [UNCLEAR]

647
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,759
[UNCLEAR]

648
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,240
pull it out there.

649
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,120
Yes, that it is

650
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,560
and this is to be tucked in here, you see Yogi: Yes.

651
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,800
Just an end of it, you see, this end.

652
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,480
This end - yes, tuck it in here.

653
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,280
and you can pull it a little bit

654
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,000
if you want through or very thin you can pull it [UNCLEAR]

655
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,520
Yogi: Tuck it in otherwise it would be there

656
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,880
Haan, see. Yogi: Thank You!

657
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,360
It's good. Yogi: I'll leave it on till Monday then.

658
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,560
This is a very, ah, mobile state.

659
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,320
You see, you can use it for bathing,

660
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:11,120
you can use it for a towel rail, you can use it for a curtain.

661
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,200
You got [UNCLEAR]

662
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,040
Annh?

663
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,600
Yogi: Is the Sea puja also for rain?

664
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,439
Yes, of course, that's for rain only.

665
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,360
We did for rain the Sea puja one.

666
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,799
Now what about you people?

667
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,440
Yogini: Lunch is ready now.

668
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,120
It's perfect.

669
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,480
Yogi: Are You [UNCLEAR]? Hmm.

670
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,360
It's perfect. Try it.

671
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,880
Yogi: Mother [UNCLEAR]

672
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,279
Put it in the[UNCLEAR]

673
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,040
They must have given you

674
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,120
I told them to give you that porridge in Delhi.

675
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:13,240
What are they called as - cuckoo? ["Cucalla"]

676
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,320
So many birds!

677
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,560
Yogi: Can Stephen please come up.

678
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,920
You remember the[UNCLEAR] [FRUIT OR FOOD?]

679
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,760
who said that first time I've seen a ..... bird.

680
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,520
Yogi: They found that most of the ornamental work for gardens,

681
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:43,600
Yogi: if not all of it, is done in concrete. In cement. Yeah!

682
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,600
Yogi: and they are not so very keen on working in cement

683
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,360
they prefer to work in plaster.

684
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,120
No, plaster won't stay outside.

685
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,040
in the garden, you have to use cement.

686
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,160
Is a very difficult work to do it with cement.

687
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,720
Now you must come in Sydney which there are

688
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,600
so many places done with cement - such beautiful pieces

689
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,800
- if you can just make the replicas of those.

690
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,560
First you have to buy some of these - just make a replica.

691
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,240
Yogi: Mother...These are garden ornaments.. Are they? Mother: Yes, yes.

692
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,880
Yogi: Mother, you were mentioning that

693
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,920
we could have some replica of your face

694
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,040
Somebody was going to do that then what happened?

695
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,240
Yogi: Robin is the expert

696
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,840
Yogi: I got everything here, Mother.

697
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,240
Then why not do it, tonight?

698
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,080
Try. It is a good idea.

699
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,320
Tonight you can try.

700
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,960
Yogi: Can I just ask one more question, Mother, concerning the John and the plastering

701
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,080
Yogi: job and the plastering that is

702
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,840
Yogi: they're all wondering whether

703
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,400
perhaps it might be better to go into

704
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:03,120
Y:plastering for inside things like cornices and inside moldings and

705
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,720
Yogi: model work for interior. Yeah.

706
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,720
Yogi: Perhaps, from what You were saying Mother they

707
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,680
Yogi: could do both?

708
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,319
Interior is easier

709
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,799
interior work is easier.

710
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,399
Here I saw in Sydney beautiful

711
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,839
I showed him beautiful roses and things. Yogi: at the centre

712
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,120
There are two types of things they do -

713
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,200
one which is a plain cornice

714
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,200
so what they do

715
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,080
is a plain cornice, you see

716
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,560
so they will do one thing like

717
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,320
they'll make a thing cut like that.

718
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,400
in wood or sharpen it and then put it along the

719
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,280
they put the whole thing and just

720
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,440
take it out so the whole thing comes out of a (.....)

721
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,799
And they sometimes mix it with cement

722
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,080
so it takes time to set

723
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,680
or if you can mix it with salt also it takes time to set

724
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,880
because here you see, it sets very fast, yes.

725
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,080
Doesn't take much time to set.

726
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:27,200
So what they do they put a triangular thing first on the walls

727
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,960
and just take another sharp one which chops.

728
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,080
He knows, hmm!

729
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,799
And for the roses and all I've seen beautiful things here

730
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,080
but as he had done is to make a Georgian style.

731
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,560
We have used Georgian style in Our house

732
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,520
because it's a Georgian house.

733
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,839
So, if you want I can send you the book.

734
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:01,440
You can get it also here, I'm sure, on Georgian style of these plasterwork

735
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,960
Yogi: you can get it here.

736
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,720
You had given Me the book

737
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,799
on Georgian style of house - you remember?

738
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,480
Yeah, yeah! Ah! you must see the

739
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,000
house - part of it has come how I have done it.

740
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,680
Come along, you'll be interested. Oh!

741
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:27,000
Only the ground floor, the ground floor has come up.

742
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,680
My bedroom and the entrance can see it here

743
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,279
This is the entrance I think

744
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,400
and you enter here

745
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,960
[UNCLEAR]

746
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,080
These are the pictures - entrance you see. This is a big hall.

747
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,480
But we have done it more now.

748
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,320
Yogi: Can everybody have a look at these, Mother? Yes, by all means.

749
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,320
Now,

750
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:31,520
that's only one reception - the ground floor.

751
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,720
Then we have one down below, we have one upstairs

752
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,320
and now this is leading to My bedroom - this one is.

753
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,319
Have you seen the staircase? Show him the staircase.

754
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,960
Yogi: That looks bit of the staircase there Mother.

755
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,960
Yes, part of it but there is something showing very clearly

756
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,760
also staircase.

757
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,520
Yogi: Where is this? This is from India.

758
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,200
Yogi: Yes, gilded.

759
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,080
Yogi: That's very beautiful! Mother: All right?

760
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,360
Yogi: That was done in India, was it, Mother? That, that part.

761
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,920
This I would tell you

762
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,319
that this is the door through which We enter in, alright?

763
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,560
and this is a sort of a partition I've built in

764
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,400
which gives it an inside you see is a sort of a passage that side

765
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:22,319
and this is the thing for sitting down here which extends to that

766
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,399
at the same one, it's the extension of the same. Yogi: Yes.

767
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,880
Yogi: That [UNCLEAR] is here

768
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,160
Yogi: This is a (....)

769
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,000
One they have taken in the daytime one in the night -

770
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,279
- so you see there are two types. (....)

771
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,200
But still this is the informal one. The formal one is even better

772
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,200
at upstairs, yeah.

773
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,120
Yeah, is it, does it, now see this one is the

774
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,760
entrance to your Mother's bedroom -

775
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,560
in the daytime.

776
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,040
This is a, this is actually

777
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,319
eh, what you call this black wood is ebony

778
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,080
this I've got it from India also.

779
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,560
Then this is the one which is going down also.

780
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,680
You see the passage going down to the kitchen?

781
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,880
And there's a dining room that side.

782
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,520
Now, this is the again in the night - I think daytime.

783
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,880
Now this is part of My bedroom, just a corner of My bedroom.

784
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:40,800
Yogi: Yes. This is the corner of My bedroom Yogi: It's very beautiful

785
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,960
it's just a corner. I mean it's a very large bedroom -

786
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,839
it has a sitting place and all that and a batheing room.

787
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,279
but just partly they have done it.

788
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,040
Yogi: Is C.P. happy now, Mother with everything. Huun? Very.

789
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,959
We're, you see, what you sent was all lost

790
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,000
because they couldn't make anything out of it.

791
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,040
so again we had to re-do it and there were so many laws and regulations

792
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:22,080
but there's so many laws you can't imagine.

793
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:26,720
That house is a Georgian house, listed house, 250 year old house

794
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,520
you can't do anything about it you can't

795
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,360
but despite that it has come out well.

796
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,800
Actually he's amazed despite all the laws

797
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,800
I've been able to do something to that house.

798
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,360
Y:Imagine what a lot of bother at not being able to do anything outside

799
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,840
No, inside also, inside also.

800
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,759
We had to use only Georgian style things

801
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,920
they are very particularly they are - this is a 250 year old house.

802
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,240
That's all, we did not know the laws.

803
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,360
Yogi: The heavy blue one

804
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,720
Heavy blue one is beautiful. Yogi: and was it a blue one?

805
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,200
Yeah. Yogi: And a colourful one for children

806
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,960
has lots of flowers on it.

807
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,200
Yogi: pink, pink flowers on it.

808
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,560
They saw that very beautiful!

809
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,680
And you know how much it is? The flower one is forty-seven

810
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,440
rupees a meter can you imagine? Yogi: And the other one was sixty.

811
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,240
All hand done.

812
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,560
Yogi: I mean that's a quarter of price Mother: fifty-seven,

813
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,240
the other is fifty-seven.

814
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,840
Yogi: Peter 's just saying you pay 300 rupees here, a meter.

815
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:40,839
Still you can't get it.

816
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,160
That work I don't know - can you get that work?

817
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,960
Yogi: It's imported from India here.

818
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,480
That this one is the best among all of them.

819
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,200
You see there are types and types

820
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,480
they were even 20 rupees available but We bought the best.

821
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,600
And they did not charge you any customs or anything

822
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,880
when you brought these things with you?

823
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:04,919
Have you all seen it?

824
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,200
It's in the night that's why it is looking goldenish, you see.

825
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,600
But if you see in the daytime it, I don't know why it looks bluish.

826
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,040
Yogi: Depends what light is on.

827
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,240
They should have had a standard lighting system

828
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,920
Standard lighting he must have done, he's very good way.

829
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,560
But I think, you know, maybe, My influence.

830
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,720
Yogi: What's that Mother? Must be My influence I think

831
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,040
in the house - vibrations wise

832
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,680
See this is pink, you see the same color as that.

833
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,800
Yogi: Yet it's come out different but you see I've touched all these.

834
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:02,080
What we should do is to have all the corners done and

835
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:07,560
put them together like that, alright. Yogi:That will make a panorama

836
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,920
This has come out alright - the colour,

837
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,759
this is also good colour the same colour. Yogi: Yes.

838
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,040
Yogi: Yes see the colour of the chairs is correct.

839
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,880
Actually that This is darker that's not so dark it's lighter

840
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,600
Yogi: but more reddish, you see more reddish also

841
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,400
but you like this. Yogi: Yes.

842
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,480
Yogi: That was actually fabricated. Mother: It's a, We worked it out, yes.

843
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,480
I've put a little gold on top here, you see

844
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:49,960
but this honeycomb is very good pattern also we must say -

845
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,600
pattern is very good, rare

846
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,280
but these look so nice on that - annh little, little things.

847
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,560
Haan.

848
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,800
Annh? Yogi: There isn't actually a hall there, is there,

849
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,800
it just gives the effect of a hall.

850
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,120
Hall. See it's a partial...

851
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,800
actually we should not make a hall completely separated.

852
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:19,960
There is no need. We do it and by that we kill the effect

853
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,360
because hall looks so small and congested.

854
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,720
This hall used to look very congested before.

855
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,840
Now just because I've put a partition instead of the hall.

856
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:32,319
And now we've done one more thing I must tell you here

857
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:39,320
is we have lifted this up a little from inside, from that side

858
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,879
and made a platform brought it Yogi: [UNCLEAR] Yes.

859
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,080
brought it at the level of this. Yogi: I see

860
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,760
This is it is in one level.

861
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:53,240
Y: Yes. And that side is lifted so that there is a platform on which

862
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,759
Yogi: A plinth, like a plinth base Yes,

863
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,760
quite a big one.

864
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,400
It is in one line you see now. Yogi: Yes, yes, yes.

865
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,920
is in one line. It was like this, it is in one line.

866
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,320
Yogi: Yes it would give it a better line. Then

867
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,359
Yogi: Did Laurent ever finish Your kitchen Mother Ha, ha, yes.

868
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:24,800
You see, you see these are these are 250 year old tiles here

869
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,360
there it works and all the story of Christ and Bible.

870
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:37,080
This is the story of Bible and the another one is the

871
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:39,960
story of Christ, the one here.

872
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:45,160
It doesn't show here but this (one is here?)

873
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,720
another one is here this

874
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,960
it doesn't show.

875
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,160
Yogi: Mother, was the staircase satisfactory

876
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:02,839
- the one that came from India did that

877
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,720
Oh! that's the one here. Yogi: Hmm, nice

878
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,120
Yogi: You are pleased with it?

879
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:08,559
You, you have not seen all this?

880
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,359
You have seen it.

881
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,440
It has Yogi: I've seen

882
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:17,160
Yogi: prior to being gilded and after it's been gilded.

883
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,920
Is he what? C.P. was like

884
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:25,920
lot of [UNCLEAR] found [UNCLEAR] try to convince him.

885
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:33,799
These carpets are built-in carpets I must say - these are not real.

886
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,160
Yogi: Not Indian?

887
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,439
The top one has got Indian.

888
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,200
Yogi: These chandeliers look lovely there, Mother.

889
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:44,479
Do they?

890
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,600
Showing the color though - it's pink color

891
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,200
the pink it was.  (....)

892
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,440
Where is the baby of Christine?

893
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,280
Yogi: Diane's baby.

894
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,919
No the other baby Yogi: No Christine No, not

895
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,080
Ehh!

896
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,280
Diane's baby with the other one whose got a (....)

897
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,880
Yogi: Oh, right, Sally's. Sally's

898
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,240
Sally's baby.

899
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,400
You sit here.

900
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:47,120
Yogi: He's sitting over there with his father. Bring him over forth

901
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,960
Are they getting better?

902
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:08,600
Suddenly it goes off. In two monthsâ€™ time they will suffer.

903
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,480
Annh? Suddenly it goes Yogi: When he's tired, Mother.

904
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,000
Yogi: When the muscles are fatigued.

905
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,400
Come here, how are you?

906
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:24,480
Hmm! Iske bachche ki kaisi kaisi

907
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,120
isse se dil kitta kya ho jayega, dil ghabra gaya.

908
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:37,599
Iske jo munh mein aata woh bolti thi, ki Mataji ka [UNCLEAR]

909
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,200
main bahut buri huun Sahajyogini huun mujhe bahut Mataji [UNCLEAR]

910
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,679
aur main jo keh rahin huun [UNCLEAR] (long 4 minute break in tape then restarts)

911
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,880
Nothing is happening, there is nothing to cry.

912
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:45,640
Yes, no, there's nothing to cry it's all fun yes, yes. (....)

913
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,200
Which like soups and things.

914
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,960
Yogini: One month old Yes, you should start.

915
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:53,599
Little bit soup is alright. Yogi: strained, Mother: Nothing wrong in doing it.

916
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,760
Strained, absolutely strained - just water.

917
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,160
But little soup and things like will be good for them.

918
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,759
Yogi: In barley water soup, barley soup and In

919
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,240
barley, little bit, barley water is very good.

920
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,200
Barley water or you can start with juices if you like

921
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,799
and then go to soups and then to

922
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,640
- I mean the system must get used to that, you see.

923
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,000
Gradually you must bring 'round children to food

924
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,400
not suddenly the heavy food.

925
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,880
Y: Adrian six months he hasn't had anything [UNCLEAR]

926
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,720
Y: because we got the message You said that it was six months

927
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,480
that they should have food for the first time.

928
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:34,360
Food is different I mean this is Yogi: This is a clear liquid

929
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,880
Yogini: You know that's that's the way we

930
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,960
Food means solid food

931
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,200
solid food you see what you can give them rice

932
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,920
and dal cooked together make it very

933
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,400
because if you train up the system properly. Yogini: Yes.

934
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,560
First you start with juices then come to soups

935
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:58,240
and then come to solid food in the sense that it is semi-solid.

936
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,280
You can cook rice and dal together make a khichdi - she knows that

937
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,560
to make it. Thin it out and give it to the child

938
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:09,280
that you can do but not this dal - moong dal

939
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:14,680
moong dal and rice you can cook together and start with that

940
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:19,240
after six months. Food means when there are solid parts.

941
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,040
But juices and soups you must start.

942
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:27,280
Yogini: Yes. Important. Yogi: and water.

943
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,680
And water you should start immediately.

944
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,920
After a month you should start water, boiled water you must start.

945
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,280
But I saw your child getting a

946
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:41,080
isn't it your child was having water alright.

947
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:44,040
Yes. Yes, what is her age? Yogini: she's ten months

948
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,240
Yogi: Ten, ten months. Yogini: He's ten months.

949
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:51,320
Ten months I saw - but when you started? Yogi: At what age?

950
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:59,040
You had they had water.

951
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,920
That's good. So they had water.

952
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,440
Now what else you wanted to know?

953
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:11,640
Yogini: The baby's waking at night, Mother

954
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,559
Y: what do we do to get them out of doing waking up at night time?

955
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:22,280
You see there are because they're wet in the night that's why

956
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:26,720
they get up, isn't it, or for no rhyme and reason?

957
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,040
Yogini: Yes, no rhyme and reason.

958
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,719
Alright, so what you have to do is to massage their body with oil

959
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,680
and massage their head with oil

960
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,880
put lot of oil in their heads, you see

961
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,800
and then put some powder and clean it up, you see.

962
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,440
Give them a massage in the night, they'll sleep very well.

963
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,680
They won't get up.

964
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,879
In the night you should give them a massage in case

965
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,519
they are restless in the night or something like that

966
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,360
before sleeping.

967
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:59,520
You give them their last meal, say about what time you

968
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,520
give them last. 8 o'clock or 6 o'clock?

969
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,160
Yogini: It depends on their age

970
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,320
Yogini: Gabriel and Luke have their dinner at about 6 o'clock

971
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:13,760
Yogini: Adrian has... he goes to bed at

972
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,920
Yogini: his last meal at about 7.30 - 8.

973
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,040
Alright, so what you do 6 o' clock

974
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:21,920
you give him one feed, alright and

975
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,559
eh 9 o'clock another one - you can give like that.

976
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,640
One one more in the 9 o'  so they won't be hungry

977
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,200
but in between you can do the massage for the body.

978
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,680
Say about 7 o'clock you can do the massage.

979
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,679
Alright. Yogini: Yes, Mother.

980
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,840
So, 7.30 then he goes to bed.

981
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,240
9 o'clock in his sleep he must have

982
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,040
in his sleep and then in the morning he'll get up at about 5

983
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,400
that's all.

984
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,800
It's very simple 5 or 6.

985
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:55,519
But I think you people don't massage the body so much of them - dry.

986
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,000
We have to massage it twice in the beginning.

987
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:01,519
Twice - one in the night, one in the daytime.

988
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,440
Alright, now what else?

989
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,040
Yogi: When do they stop breast-feeding, Mother?

990
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:12,200
Ten months. Gradually they should take to bottle.

991
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:15,240
Ten months they can stop ten, twelve, you see.

992
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,519
In India they used to stop after three years nobody bothered.

993
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:25,960
But it's better to stop it by ten, eleven or eleven months or so.

994
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,880
Yogi: If they don't get the mother's milk

995
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,320
Yogi: say they have to cut it short

996
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,920
Of course, of course you should take to bottle

997
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:36,559
no harm in giving bottle milk.

998
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,280
Do it properly but you see if you do not give the nipple

999
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,000
in the mouth of the child of the bottle

1000
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,760
from the very beginning or say about one or two months

1001
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,240
or three months at the most they won't take to it easily.

1002
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,519
So best is to give one, one feed after three months.

1003
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,280
Start giving them one feed.

1004
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,879
When the child is sleeping you give one feed.

1005
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,800
then the child is used to the nipple, you see. You have to

1006
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,080
understand the child has to get used to everything.

1007
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:05,000
Yogini: Yes. Then they easily move but otherwise you suddenly

1008
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,519
Yogini: Yes, yes Mother, they were started at six months

1009
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,840
Yogini: but then they just don't want to eat the food that's given

1010
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,080
Yogini: them some of the other babies that have been eating

1011
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,599
solid food for a while. Because the food is not tasty

1012
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,680
Yogini: It's not tasty. Annh!

1013
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:19,120
You must make it tastier you see, you must put proper salt

1014
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:23,400
Salt must be properly put and little tasty it must be made

1015
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,960
you see, a little bit of butter, little bit.

1016
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:31,280
You see, you must make it tasty otherwise the food is not tasty

1017
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:36,240
they don't like it. The tongue, just like us.

1018
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:39,040
Yogi: You tell her Mother in Sydney they must have salt

1019
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,599
Yogi: in their food and they must...

1020
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,320
Annh, this is a very funny idea not to have salt.

1021
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:48,400
You all, do you all suffer from high blood pressure?

1022
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,840
Yogi:[UNCLEAR] You see, without salt

1023
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:57,719
you cannot do your respiration - ask any doctor.

1024
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,920
If there is no sodium, sodium chloride in your blood

1025
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,120
see your respiration will go down.

1026
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:08,120
These things are essential for life but not too much of everything.

1027
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,519
Salt is needed with food.

1028
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,800
I mean these are all funny ideas that are coming up

1029
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:18,400
but the worse thing is that you are so naÃ¯ve just like children.

1030
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:22,160
I mean if anybody tells that don't take salt we'll just be

1031
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:26,440
saying oh! you, you must be coming from lunatic asylum.

1032
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,759
But if you are suffering from high blood pressure,

1033
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,720
if there's a problem of that or something then you skip.

1034
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:37,200
Salt is very important for teeth for everything.

1035
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:42,280
To feel relaxed is the best way to reduce the blood pressure.

1036
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:47,160
What else is? Yogi: There's also a belief that if you give children

1037
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:51,760
Yogi: sweet food as a small baby and child that it will grow up and

1038
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,000
Yogi: have blood sugar problems.

1039
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,720
Yogi: So they give very sour, sweet, sour lemon, sour food

1040
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,880
I told that, you see how blood sugar comes in

1041
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:04,720
because of diabetes isn't it, not because of sugar.

1042
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,280
It comes only because of diabetes

1043
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:10,120
and diabetes comes because of thinking too much.

1044
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,080
If you make your child agitated all the time

1045
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,920
you want him to think and do this very well in the school at the age

1046
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,800
of five years if you want him to do 'O' level

1047
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,280
then what would happen?

1048
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,200
You see she want to
01:25:24:10 01:25:27:21make the child, do competition, what is left over by you then.

1049
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:32,800
Take it easy. Let the child study as well as grow normally.

1050
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,840
Yogi: Is it wise to for the baby to sleep in the

1051
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,800
same bed as the parents and up to what age, Mother?

1052
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,160
To very small six age. Not every time it's not proper.

1053
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:48,559
I don't think it's good all the time but little bit while

1054
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,520
and then the child must sleep in all [UNCLEAR] in his bed.

1055
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,120
Always sleeping in his bed is the best

1056
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,320
but in the same room not in some other room.

1057
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,960
But then you should take the baby to with you

1058
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,280
when you are nursing or anything for a while

1059
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,639
that's all but mostly the child should be in the bed.

1060
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,800
It's not with the parents if he's sleeping

1061
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,880
between the two parents to be crushed

1062
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,400
Yogi: And then until what age should young

1063
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,360
children be kept in the same bedroom?

1064
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:21,840
I think even now My children sleep with Me, so what can I do?

1065
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:25,120
I think We are different type of people.

1066
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,440
We don't undress ourselves when we sleep.

1067
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,960
That's the problem with you.

1068
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,320
I hope Sahaja yogis are not sleeping like that.

1069
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,720
Please don't sleep without clothes - bhoots will enter into you.

1070
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,520
Must wear your clothes and then sleep.

1071
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:41,760
I'm telling you don't sleep without clothes.

1072
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:45,120
Bhoots, that's the best way the bhoots enter you.

1073
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:49,160
What is the need I don't understand.

1074
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,080
Yogini: Mother this umm

1075
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,679
Y: some of the babies have been experiencing a lot of pain while

1076
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:58,440
Y: they're cutting their teeth for their teeth are coming through

1077
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:02,040
Yes, a very old medicine called Steveman's powder

1078
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:05,400
Steveman's powder, write it down.

1079
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,400
Get some ivory rings, are very good for children.

1080
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:13,440
Ivory rings. Y: Teething rings. Ivory rings you get them in India.

1081
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,760
You get here plastic ones we get ivory ones.

1082
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,680
You get some of these rings - are very good for children.

1083
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,920
Yogi: Albert you gonna get those?

1084
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:25,320
Yogi: Ivory rings, rings, teething rings.

1085
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,400
Yogini: Mother, another question.

1086
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,040
Yogini: What do you think about dummies for the babies?

1087
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,440
Dummies? Yogini: Yes, you know dummies are

1088
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:45,160
Yogini: the litle rubber thing shape like a nipple to an extent and

1089
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,759
You see, they might develop that teeth are

1090
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:50,200
coming out if you give too much of that.

1091
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,839
Yogini: Yes, if you give too much but a little bit of

1092
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,920
maybe to settle the baby down to sleep

1093
01:27:55,120 --> 01:28:01,080
It's alright, little bit is alright, but try to keep it away.

1094
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:04,320
You see, best is to give vishudhdhi treatment

1095
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:07,040
and not have it otherwise the teeth will be running parallel

1096
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:10,960
Y: Yes Mother. and you'll have lot of problem setting them back.

1097
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:15,599
Yogi: Yes. Haan! But it's true - little bit you can give that.

1098
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,000
They are called as dummies, are they? Y: Dummies they call, yes.

1099
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:25,720
Yogini: dummy nipples Mother: Han, alright, there's no harm.

1100
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,920
Yogi: They want to know about toilet training, Mother.

1101
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,880
What is that? Yogi: How to stop the baby from

1102
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,880
Yogi: wetting the nappies and using the pot, basically?

1103
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:42,160
For that at the age of only two months or three months

1104
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:45,559
you must start touching the bottom of the baby to your pot

1105
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:49,880
you see, keep a little pot like that and try to say, make some sound

1106
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,559
like that and all that the child starts seeing it and

1107
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:55,680
he gets used to the touch, you see, of the thing

1108
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:59,360
Then he he knows that's an impulse, you see, in him

1109
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:02,640
that acts as a message and you can do it.

1110
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:05,760
It's very simple. Y: Very early then. Very early you must start it

1111
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,640
very early Yogini: We don't do that.

1112
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,400
That's it because you have these dry drips, that's why.

1113
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,360
Yogi: Mr. Freud said we shouldn't do it, Mother. Why?

1114
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:18,480
Yogi: It'll give you a complex. Mother: What?

1115
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:23,840
What is the complex?

1116
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,200
Yogi: No, that's right. Complex?

1117
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:32,280
We all Indians do it. We don't have any complexes I think [UNCLEAR]

1118
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:36,520
The one who has given you real complex is Mr. Freud himself.

1119
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,040
What complex can be, kya hoga? I can't understand.

1120
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,360
Beyond My imagination. Yogi: Whole this nonsense about

1121
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:46,200
Yogi: how you were toilet trained and if you,

1122
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,320
Yogi: It explains why you behave in a certain way when you're

1123
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:52,880
Yogi: grown up and according to how you sat on the potty and

1124
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,960
Yogi: It's true, Mother.

1125
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,560
We don't even know about these things

1126
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,640
How could [UNCLEAR] nonsense, ha, ha ha.

1127
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,760
Yogini: Another question, Mother. Mother: That's why you people

1128
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:27,320
are very addicted to bathrooms also, we are not.

1129
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,360
You see, we are there hardly for 5-10 minutes,

1130
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,480
have a bath get out of it, you see.

1131
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,800
The addiction comes from that kind of a thing.

1132
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:37,160
You're very bathroom cultured, that's why.

1133
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,639
Yogi: All this graffiti business is Graffiti?

1134
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:42,200
Yogi: Graffiti - writing on the walls

1135
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,440
Yogi:  all that stuff it's all coming from that.

1136
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:53,800
Writing on the walls?

1137
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,480
The best thing if you are constipated take a newspaper -

1138
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:07,400
simple thing and horrid news

1139
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,240
that's how I've seen some people have treated them.

1140
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,080
They say, "We get constipated".

1141
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,200
I said read a newspaper in the morning.

1142
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,519
That's the place you should read newspaper actually, nowhere else.

1143
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,840
That it is worth, nothing else you know.

1144
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:34,360
I would do that.

1145
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,680
Mean I don't get any chance or anything I would say that better

1146
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:40,840
read it in, newspaper in the bathroom - that's the place it's

1147
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:44,280
because such filth in there.

1148
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:52,280
No, no, no he's, I tell you he must be a sweeper in his last life.

1149
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,080
Must be something wrong with this Freud, I think

1150
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,800
must have been a sweeper.

1151
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:59,280
Yogi: 12 years ago in England, Mother, there was a man

1152
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:01,679
Yogi: called Dr. Alex Comfort who's basically a

1153
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:05,080
Yogi: descendant of Freudian psychology who's said that

1154
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,759
Yogi: you should have contraceptives available in the market place

1155
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:10,720
for children to buy as from the age of twelve.

1156
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,720
Yogi: So that's now far we've gone. For what?

1157
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:17,160
Yogi: Contraception..... Oh, Oh, I see, what fun we have!

1158
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:21,280
Oh, Oh! This is another joke.

1159
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,560
I thought must be for constipation some

1160
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,240
Yogi: Maybe that

1161
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,559
Yogi: that's instead of the new

1162
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:41,120
But where we are boys don't even understand these things.

1163
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,280
Yogi: They do here, Mother, in the West.

1164
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,480
In the West maybe, here they are overgrown.

1165
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:51,040
You don't allow them to be natural

1166
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,920
putting all these ideas into the head.

1167
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:57,519
Twelve year boy - Yogi: Hmm.

1168
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,920
always their nonsense

1169
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:09,240
Yogini: Mother, some more questions. Hmmm.

1170
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:13,720
Yogini: What should mothers do about constipation in the babies?

1171
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,360
You see, they should not have constipation themselves.

1172
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,600
Yogini: Well they do, when they're on the formula mixtures.

1173
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:22,280
Yes so we, we have so many ways of removing in India

1174
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:25,519
like we take that ajwain ka churan and all that all the time when

1175
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:31,480
the little black grapes, dried ones, raisins - black raisins,

1176
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:36,960
yes, fruits with a, with orange juice - orange juice is very good

1177
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:41,800
and also milk, boiled milk in the night. Hmmm, very good.

1178
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:43,720
Yogini: That's another thing Mother when

1179
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,080
Yogini: when they weaned from the mother's breast

1180
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:49,599
Yogini: are they weaned onto cow's milk

1181
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:51,880
To what? Yogini: Cow's milk do we

1182
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:56,440
Yogi: From breast to cow's milk or from breast to formula mixture?

1183
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,080
I mean, we give cow's milk.

1184
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,960
Because this formula nowadays I don't know what they do that.

1185
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,840
Yogi: It makes black stools it's

1186
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,800
If you get cow's milk better is to remove the cream

1187
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,760
put the water in it and boil it.

1188
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,960
Remove the cream and that's the best for the children.

1189
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,719
But boil it together not separately.

1190
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:23,880
Always boil the milk and the water together, never separately.

1191
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:28,480
Yogi: So all these mothers on formula should transfer to cow's milk.

1192
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:31,160
Yogi: All these mothers who are feeding their babies on formula

1193
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,440
Yogi: on this mixture, on this powdered stuff

1194
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:36,720
Yogi: should change to cow's milk?

1195
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:39,640
Yes, I mean if the children can digest cow's milk nothing like that

1196
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:42,440
if they can digest. But you must know

1197
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:44,680
what is the amount of water you should put

1198
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:49,000
Yogi: Proportion because that's more natural to take to cow's milk.

1199
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:53,720
Yogi: Well you're supposed to be feeding them off the breast, if you cannot feed them off the breast

1200
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,640
No, but what we do then, you see, for some time you

1201
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,200
can take formula because might be it is better

1202
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,879
according to the age group

1203
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:07,640
but say after ten months you can take to cow's milk alright.

1204
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,680
But little bit one feed you should start

1205
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,160
by the time they are about three months

1206
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:17,880
before they are conscious, must start one feed.

1207
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:21,480
Is she giving one feed at least to the baby or not?

1208
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:25,680
No, not yet. No, no, not her. I'm saying

1209
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,800
hmmm Barbara

1210
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:31,360
Barbara, is she giving one feed to the baby?

1211
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,400
Yogini: No, Mother, only breast milk, Mother: only breast milk?

1212
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:37,680
You should start now all right, otherwise again he'll be very angry

1213
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:40,280
with the bottle. Y: he is, Mother

1214
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,879
I tried with the bottle before he doesn't like it. See?

1215
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:45,240
So, must, better start earlier always

1216
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,160
- one feed you must start earlier.

1217
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,599
Say one month you can start because children

1218
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,880
here are very adamant type you see.

1219
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:57,440
What other things?

1220
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:01,160
Yogini: Medication for children. Yogini: Mother,

1221
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:04,040
Yogini: a lot of Panadol given to the babies

1222
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:05,320
Panadol? For what? Yogini: Yes Mother

1223
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:11,960
Yogini: For temperatures or irritability. Teething

1224
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,520
Yogini: when the baby is crying or upset.

1225
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:17,080
I don't think Panadol is a very good thing

1226
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,599
- horrible. Yogi: No, it contains

1227
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,280
It's not a very good thing, you see, just Yogi: It contains Aspirin

1228
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:22,040
- Paracetamol

1229
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,639
It can make the child very bad later on

1230
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,640
see, after the effect. Y: Liver - it could cause liver problems.

1231
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,480
Oh, really? it's not good you see

1232
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:32,320
say a child is irritable or anything, you see,

1233
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:34,920
you should find out what is exactly the trouble is,

1234
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:37,480
is it due to the stomach trouble or anything?

1235
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:40,480
Then according to that you should give but there are natural

1236
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:43,520
things that you should give to the baby and not unnatural.

1237
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:46,560
Say a child has got a diarrhoea, alright,

1238
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,760
a simple method is to boil this fennel

1239
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,400
Yogi: Fennel, fennel fennel.  - fennel, fennel seeds

1240
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:58,680
and mint together, boil it. Keep it ready

1241
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,520
and give that with little sugar or candy sugar

1242
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,760
and give that to the child twice, thrice.

1243
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:09,160
Simple things like that I can give you so many medicines.

1244
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:10,000
Yogini: Yes, Mother.

1245
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:13,840
Very simple. You should see why the child is sick.

1246
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:17,160
Panadol is something like a sleeping pill only.

1247
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:17,920
Yogini: Yes, it is.

1248
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:21,240
That's very bad at that age.

1249
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,800
Yogini: Another question, Mother.

1250
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,880
Yogi: What about gripe water, Mother - do we use that?

1251
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:31,120
For the baby is alright but what about the mother?

1252
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,320
Mother has to take it out now, what else.

1253
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:39,080
Wind - what you can get here.

1254
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:43,800
You must be having some medicines for wind,

1255
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:48,160
Yogi: Just the usual ones, Mother. Antacids or something (unclear)

1256
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:56,200
Yogi: It's fairly innocuous, isn't it?

1257
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:59,759
Yogi: It - do they boil the alcohol off it?

1258
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:01,120
What is that?

1259
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:04,000
Y: It originally has some small volume of alcohol. 4%, 4%.

1260
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:07,400
What is it? Yogis: 4% alcohol In what?

1261
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:12,240
Yogis: In gripe water. Gripe

1262
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:16,680
No we don't give gripe water to the children at all.

1263
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:21,280
We give this ajwain water and to the mother.

1264
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:23,320
There's another way is to

1265
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,080
ajwain is the only thing I know very well because -

1266
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:29,559
I'll find out for you there's something else that you can have.

1267
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:34,640
Y: Should the mothers have a diet avoiding wind producing foods.

1268
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:37,320
Ha of course, they should not eat rice at all.

1269
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:39,640
They should not eat rice, they should

1270
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:43,480
not eat anything that is grown under the earth.

1271
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:48,599
Potato also they should not - anything like that.

1272
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:53,720
Rice, potatoes all these things must be avoided. Yogini: Yes Mother

1273
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:05,120
You don't know these?

1274
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:06,519
Y: No, we've never [UNCLEAR]

1275
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:09,960
Rice, rice is never given to a woman who's got a baby

1276
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:13,360
Till about ten months she must avoid taking rice.

1277
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:18,320
Yogi: So, any wind producing food should be avoided by the mother.

1278
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,520
Haan! Everything that comes from the Mother Earth

1279
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:24,720
in the sense from the down below Mother Earth gives and also milk -

1280
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:28,560
milk gives wind very much.

1281
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:33,640
Milk gives - but milk boiled in an iron pot

1282
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:37,280
you see, made out of steel

1283
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:42,320
but not this stainless one, the other one, doesn't give.

1284
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,679
Yogini: No Milk boiled in an ordinary steel, cast iron pan doesn't give wind

1285
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:51,400
Yogi: a steel pot, cast iron doesn't give wind. We have a cast iron

1286
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:56,599
So you should boil that milk

1287
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:02,240
with water whatever it is together in an iron pot.

1288
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,960
So, milk should not be taken like that by mothers directly at all.

1289
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:12,040
If she has to take milk then take it with

1290
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,960
some sort of a porridge or some at the most.

1291
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:18,519
She has to take milk, no doubt, so she should take it with the

1292
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,320
porridge or these crispies or something like.

1293
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:22,480
Yogini: Yes, Mother.

1294
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:24,080
Yogi: What about nappies, Mother?

1295
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:25,840
Some of the nappies make their legs go out

1296
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:27,840
Yogi: at 45 degrees. Oh! that's horrible thing that

1297
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:31,600
you make the children wear, I'm really against it.

1298
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,080
It's very handy but it's very bad.

1299
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:38,040
Poor, this girl has suffered so much

1300
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,759
even now she has problems you see.

1301
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:45,360
A plastic stuff - but we don't use plastic stuff, you see.

1302
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:48,880
We use cotton ones - nice cotton ones

1303
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:54,400
and we put little, what you call absorbent cotton.

1304
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:57,640
Yogi: I think we call them flannelette napkins here Mother.

1305
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:01,400
Hmmm. And then we remove the cotton if the

1306
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:05,840
napkin is also wet, we remove the napkin - it can be washed.

1307
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:11,480
You see, we can have about 12 or say 24

1308
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:15,320
kept like that - it's very simple how to make it, I'll show you

1309
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:18,680
[alright?] This is the say is the nappy

1310
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:23,160
so you get a soft cloth - some sort of a malmal or something

1311
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:26,040
- in India you get such a lot of them - readymade

1312
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:29,760
Now what you do is to make it like that, alright.

1313
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:32,080
Yogini: Yes. Now it's done.

1314
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:36,840
not a thing like this for a little baby

1315
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:39,880
but you can have a soft towel you can get

1316
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:44,440
Yogini: We get, we get soft towelling

1317
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:46,120
Yogini: many of us do it that way

1318
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,639
Alright, and then you must wash them.

1319
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:51,960
Hardly it takes any time for you to wash - say in

1320
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:55,000
a day you take about - in the beginning they are

1321
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,440
small and you need more numbers

1322
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:00,600
later on you don't need them but you don't have all

1323
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,200
these problems of the plastic for the baby

1324
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,160
and the child is allowed to breathe, his body grows well

1325
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:10,320
otherwise they have the back side is so pushed in funny figures and

1326
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:12,880
they also have what you call the legs going like that.

1327
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:14,120
Yogi: Hip, hip joints go

1328
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:18,240
It's very bad, it's very strong and should be avoided.

1329
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:21,400
Yogini: You mean the disposables or do you mean

1330
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:23,520
The disposable are not good thing

1331
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:25,520
only if you are going out somewhere, you see

1332
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:28,480
this kind of a cloth is the best.

1333
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:32,160
This is a soft one but this is very good, still

1334
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:35,360
for a little, newly born is thick for us.

1335
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:38,600
You see, we don't do all this, we don't seam it.

1336
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:42,040
Not to seam it at all. It hard, you see

1337
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:45,920
just take, open it out just like that - just we don't seam it.

1338
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:49,160
and now put it out like that - it's too big

1339
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:53,280
for a big child is alright. Now, that's all.

1340
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:56,599
You can even if you want you can put like this for a big boy

1341
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:02,240
here a little fold but normally for a little baby it's alright.
