1
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,209
But you have a new dimension;

2
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:28,167
you have to use your powers

3
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,167
for the benevolence of the people.

4
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,083
So also, your Kundalini was awakened so Sahaj;

5
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:49,209
it is because of the love and compassion of your Mother.

6
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,083
So this time, we should say,

7
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,083
your Kundalini can only be nourished

8
00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:02,042
if you develop within yourself

9
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:10,125
the sense of pure love and pure compassion.

10
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:16,125
First I've used the word “pure”, that's My name also.

11
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,083
That means you have to be innocent to begin with.

12
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:30,083
If you are not innocent then you have certain problems,

13
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,000
maybe with your lust.

14
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:38,042
Maybe your love might be directed

15
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:42,083
towards some person, only.

16
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,125
Kundalini is not like that.

17
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,125
She rises, She goes to all the chakras,

18
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,083
She doesn't get involved into any,

19
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,167
She tries to cure every chakra, nourish that chakra,

20
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,125
and She is only worried about Her ascent.

21
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:03,000
In the same way a Sahaja Yogi

22
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:06,083
should not get involved

23
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
into any relationship as such.

24
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,042
Is possible.

25
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:18,042
You don't have to become like Buddha's disciples.

26
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:21,083
For example, as I have always told you,

27
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,209
the sap in the tree rises

28
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,209
and goes to various parts of the tree

29
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:29,000
and then evaporates or comes back.

30
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:34,042
So this passage should be kept open,

31
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,125
and once this passage is kept open

32
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:46,083
the Kundalini can rise very easily without any trouble.

33
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:50,209
But this passage can be closed,

34
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:55,042
in case you get too much involved into one thing,

35
00:10:55,125 --> 00:11:00,083
because there are some people

36
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
who get involved, say in their parents to begin with.

37
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,083
All right, in the beginning I know,

38
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,083
those who come in the beginning to Sahaja Yoga,

39
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:16,083
will start saying, “Mother, my father's, sister's,

40
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,083
husband's, this things, that, is sick,

41
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:25,000
so will you please cure that person.” Very common.

42
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,042
They'll write long, long letters

43
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,125
describing the relationship

44
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:34,000
and I really lose the connection - who is this one?

45
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:35,125
Without writing the names

46
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:38,000
they will give all the connections that they have.

47
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,167
These are all artificial connections.

48
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:45,042
Tomorrow some calamity comes on you,

49
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:49,042
these relationships are of no use;

50
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,125
on the contrary you'll find they'll take advantage of it.

51
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:56,167
You cannot depend on these relations of yours,

52
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:58,167
in what family you were born,

53
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,042
in what religion you were born,

54
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:02,167
in what country you are born,

55
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:06,167
because now you are a universal being.

56
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:11,209
So you are no more related

57
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:15,042
through these artificial relationships

58
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:20,167
but you are related through your spiritual relationships.

59
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:27,000
Unless and until we establish that within ourselves

60
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,167
- that doesn't mean you give up your husband,

61
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,167
give up your wife, give up your children,

62
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,209
nothing of the kind;

63
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:39,000
but that means that if we have to give up our conditionings

64
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,167
we have to give up all these things.

65
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:48,042
There are all kinds of conditionings we have.

66
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:52,125
If there are some good conditionings,

67
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:55,125
still we should give up

68
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,125
in the sense they should not be conditionings

69
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:00,209
but we should be master of them.

70
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,042
For example Indians have one good conditioning, in a way,

71
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,125
in their own country,

72
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:08,083
that they must have their bath early in the morning.

73
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,083
I used to do the same.

74
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:14,083
Then England is horrible for that.

75
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:18,083
It takes its respite, if you do that in England,

76
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:20,167
it's a cursed country,

77
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,167
you just can't do that.

78
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,125
You have to take your bath in the night

79
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,167
otherwise give up bathing;

80
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,083
and one has to change.

81
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,042
But if you have that conditioning,

82
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,083
then you will feel very sad,

83
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,125
“Oh, oh, I've missed my bath, I'm feeling,

84
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:40,042
I can't sleep now, I can't feel all right, I am not normal.”

85
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:44,083
It’s a good conditioning but still it is enslaving you.

86
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,167
So whether it is good or bad,

87
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,167
if it is a conditioning

88
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:54,125
you should try to see it clearly, it's a conditioning.

89
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,000
That doesn't mean that you should go

90
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,042
in the opposite direction,

91
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,000
that, "All right I'll never have my bath",

92
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,000
that's not the way.

93
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,000
It is that,

94
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,000
"All right if it doesn't suit in the morning

95
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:13,083
I'll have it in the evening,

96
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,167
also doesn't matter once in a while I'll miss it.

97
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:19,083
The bath cannot control me, I'll control the bath."

98
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:22,500
Nothing should control you,

99
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:25,083
then the Kundalini moves for us,

100
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:28,083
because you must have complete liberty.

101
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:31,125
If you do not have complete liberty

102
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:34,000
then the Kundalini won't move.

103
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,375
We have conditionings of our families,

104
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,000
of our religion,

105
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,709
of our country.

106
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:52,834
These conditionings, as far as possible,

107
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:57,792
is to be seen clearly that we have got it through our

108
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:01,751
family.

109
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:03,876
If you are born a Christian

110
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:07,709
you'll always be more attached to Christ.

111
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:09,792
Christ you have not seen,

112
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,834
you don't know whether He existed or not,

113
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:13,834
whether this Bible is true or not

114
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:15,876
but you'll be more attached to Bible.

115
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,459
Now if you are a Hindu,

116
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,709
you'll be more attached to Gita or to Vedas or something.

117
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:26,709
This creates imbalance,

118
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:31,667
because we must have the same attitude

119
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:34,876
towards all the religions, towards all the scriptures;

120
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:37,834
that's the sign of a saint.

121
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:44,751
So this conditioning has to go.

122
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:49,834
In what country you are born is another conditioning

123
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:51,834
which has to be fought out;

124
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,709
very important it is.

125
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:58,667
I don't want to discuss the conditionings

126
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,709
of different countries but you know very well.

127
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:04,709
After Realization when you rise higher

128
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:06,876
than your society which is surrounding you,

129
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:11,751
you start understanding and you start describing.

130
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:14,584
I've come to know about the stupidity

131
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,834
of all these countries through the people

132
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,834
who belong to that country.

133
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:20,834
For example a Frenchman will say,

134
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:24,834
“Mother, this is typical French mind,

135
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,709
he's a French otherwise born.”

136
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,667
Or a Hindu will say,

137
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:32,667
“Mother, this is typically a Hindu man,

138
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:33,876
he will do like this.”

139
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:37,876
So then you understand that you are not typifying

140
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:39,751
that country,

141
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,709
you are a universal being

142
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,667
and you are living like a universal being.

143
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,876
Once you become the universal being

144
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,876
then also you realize that this skin-deep complexion

145
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:57,667
makes no difference in the world.

146
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:02,751
So then you don't start hating somebody

147
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:06,792
who is darker than you or who is fairer than you;

148
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,709
both ways it works.

149
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:14,584
It's not only the people who are fair hate the darker ones,

150
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:16,876
but “darkers” also hate equally.

151
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:21,459
And mutually they believe that they are all

152
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:23,792
absolutely wrong.

153
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:27,792
If you ask a fanatic

154
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:32,667
about another religion he'll say,

155
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:34,876
that's the worst religion, his is the best.

156
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:38,709
And you ask the another fanatic,

157
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:43,751
he will say his is the best, the rest of it is the worst.

158
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:45,876
That means all of them are the worst,

159
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:47,792
in a general opinion.

160
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,709
Everybody seems to be the worst,

161
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:50,876
all the fanatics are the worst,

162
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:53,876
if you take a general consensus, you see.

163
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,709
Nobody will say that,

164
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:57,834
"All right, my religion is all right

165
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,918
and at least one another is all right", nobody.

166
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,709
If you ask an Englishman he'll say,

167
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,751
“Mother, this is typically English, you can't help it.”

168
00:18:10,792 --> 00:18:13,792
They get so angry, I've seen the English getting angry

169
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,751
with the other English for misbehaving

170
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:18,792
or doing something towards Me, but I don't,

171
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,876
because they are blind.

172
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,792
So here the compassion should come within you,

173
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:26,500
as a universal being,

174
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,876
that by God's grace you have risen higher

175
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,792
in the real sense of the word.

176
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,751
It is not just you are certified,

177
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:35,709
you are realized souls, no.

178
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:41,876
You are realized souls, no doubt, you are - sakshat.

179
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:46,876
So then, as it is now, you are absolutely certified by God

180
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,918
that you are realized souls.

181
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:52,876
Naturally you must change everything.

182
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:59,751
No use typifying yourself, identifying yourself

183
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:07,876
with something that is now, you have given up.

184
00:19:07,918 --> 00:19:10,876
For example, from the egg now you have become the birds.

185
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:15,792
Now birds don't identify themselves with the eggs

186
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:18,792
and settle down in only one place, they fly.

187
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:21,709
Now they have become birds, they are no more eggs.

188
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:25,667
In the same way we should accept our position.

189
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:30,751
We should accept ourselves as realized souls

190
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:33,834
with self-esteem and understanding

191
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:36,792
as to what is our purpose of life now;

192
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,876
it is changed completely, entirely.

193
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:42,751
Once you understand the purpose of your life,

194
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:45,792
innately, not outside because I am saying,

195
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:47,667
or is a mental process,

196
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:50,709
but inside you feel responsible.

197
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:54,834
You have got Realization to spread it all over the world

198
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:57,792
and to emancipate the whole world.

199
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:00,876
Once you realize this point

200
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:04,751
then automatically you take up responsibilities

201
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,792
and the Kundalini will rise.

202
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,751
I know of many people who said,

203
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,709
“Mother, we cannot speak, You know we have a stage fright.”

204
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:15,876
All right, you just stand up, that's all.

205
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:20,876
And they started giving lectures; I had to stop them.

206
00:20:23,876 --> 00:20:25,792
There are many who said that,

207
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:28,751
“We cannot write any poems Mother, we are no good,

208
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:29,918
we cannot sing.”

209
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:33,709
I know of a girl who used to sing so horribly bad

210
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:35,792
that people had to tell her that you…

211
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,792
because she would always go out of tune

212
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,751
and very loudly she would sing;

213
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:41,667
then they had to tell her,

214
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:42,751
“Now you better keep at the back

215
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:44,751
and don't sing now any more.”

216
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:48,918
Now she is the one who is sort of leading the group.

217
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,709
So all these beautiful things start manifesting

218
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:56,751
which you should accept that they have come to you,

219
00:20:57,751 --> 00:21:02,709
and give up all that you call as fear.

220
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:07,792
All kinds of fear we have.

221
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:12,709
These are all left-sided things as you have seen yesterday,

222
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,751
left-sided man what he should do.

223
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:20,667
But what a left-sided man has to know

224
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:23,876
that he is now an enlightened soul

225
00:21:24,876 --> 00:21:29,834
and no one can touch him, leave alone destroy.

226
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:33,834
No saint will be destroyed.

227
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,918
Those who will try to destroy you

228
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:41,751
will, in a very interesting manner, will be finished.

229
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:44,918
Not destroyed but very interesting manner,

230
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,751
very jocular manner.

231
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:50,792
You'll laugh at

232
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,918
that and you will enjoy the way things are working out.

233
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:56,751
Like there's a saying in Sanskrit,

234
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:58,792
“vinashkale viprit budhi,”

235
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:01,792
means their destruction will start

236
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:04,876
by their own stupid methods.

237
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:07,709
They'll become stupid.

238
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:10,876
And at every stage you'll see they are becoming stupid

239
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:14,792
and by that stupidity they are destroying themselves.

240
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,792
You don't have to worry about that part.

241
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:19,709
So that's why you don't need any destructive powers.

242
00:22:19,876 --> 00:22:25,709
It will all be done by this all-pervading Divine Power.

243
00:22:25,918 --> 00:22:28,417
So that part you have to give up.

244
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:31,751
You just forgive that person.

245
00:22:32,876 --> 00:22:34,918
As soon as you forgive,

246
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:39,834
the responsibility from you shifts

247
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:43,792
and then Kundalini rises.

248
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:48,792
You don't have to carry any malice, anything against him,

249
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,709
but just laugh because they are blind,

250
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:54,918
because they are stupid,

251
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:56,876
they are foolish.

252
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:01,751
What do we do if you see an idiot?

253
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:04,834
We may not laugh in his presence but we do,

254
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:08,834
isn't it, at his back, because he's an idiot.

255
00:23:09,876 --> 00:23:12,876
So they become idiotic

256
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,709
and you see them becoming idiotic and then you just start.

257
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:19,500
You see that's the humor of Sahaja Yoga,

258
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:21,792
you have to have some humor also, isn't it?

259
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,751
And then you start seeing these jokers you see,

260
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:27,709
behaving in that manner

261
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:32,834
and the whole circus they do is nothing but jocular.

262
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:37,834
So there's nothing to have any fear from any human being;

263
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,751
same about organizations or anything.

264
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:43,876
Naturally you have to know one thing:

265
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:46,751
that as you are Realized souls,

266
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:48,792
you have seen the truth,

267
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:50,876
you are in the light so they are going to oppose you,

268
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:52,834
they are going to oppose you.

269
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,876
They did this, isn't it, to others;

270
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:01,834
everybody suffered so much.

271
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:06,792
But now no more sufferings to you,

272
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:10,834
only thing you can enjoy the humor.

273
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,834
Just understand this point,

274
00:24:14,918 --> 00:24:18,834
that nothing will destroy you, no one can touch you

275
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:23,751
but they are there just to supply some humor for you.

276
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:27,334
If you take such a light attitude towards them,

277
00:24:27,709 --> 00:24:30,709
all this fear and left side will go away.

278
00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:35,876
What are these baddhas, and what are these bhoots,

279
00:24:35,918 --> 00:24:38,792
and what are these tantrikas? Nothing.

280
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:40,834
You are so powerful.

281
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:42,834
Just with one glance

282
00:24:42,876 --> 00:24:45,667
you can see them dancing on their heads,

283
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:47,751
the other way round.

284
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:51,792
As long as you'll have fear

285
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:56,709
Kundalini won't rise because She doesn't rise for people

286
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:58,751
who are cowards.

287
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:01,876
Cowardice She is not going to support.

288
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,876
If you are a coward She said, “All right”.

289
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:08,834
You are walking on the street,

290
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:12,792
normally people are afraid if there's darkness,

291
00:25:12,876 --> 00:25:16,709
afraid that somebody might attack,

292
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:18,792
but a Sahaja Yogi does not,

293
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:19,834
if he's a real Sahaja Yogi,

294
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:22,751
because he knows there are ganas

295
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:24,709
and there are angels around him.

296
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:26,709
No one can touch him,

297
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:28,792
and the one who will try,

298
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:32,709
these ganas will make such a fool out of that person

299
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:34,792
that you'll have a nice chance to laugh at him.

300
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:38,751
Now you watch and see.

301
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:44,876
So this left side or this fear should go.

302
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,667
Once this fear will go all your slyness,

303
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:54,876
all your intrigues, all your jealousies will just disappear.

304
00:25:56,918 --> 00:26:01,709
That's how the Kundalini will rise very well.
