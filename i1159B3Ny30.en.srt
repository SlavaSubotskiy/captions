1
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,560
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna

2
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:18,530
as a very great personality.

3
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,740
And you know why He came on this earth --

4
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:34,620
to establish this is the new form of, not Virat, not Virata,

5
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:46,510
but a form by which this country became so prosperous.

6
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:59,530
And by His advent only He created a beautiful mentality

7
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:08,700
among the people how to develop this country with Dharma.

8
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,640
And you had very great leaders

9
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,590
who followed Him

10
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:26,510
and who worshipped Him in a way,

11
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,540
and created a new world of this America.

12
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,670
But unfortunately as the time passed on,

13
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:46,720
His form vanished from the minds of the people.

14
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,630
The reason was, Krishna was represented here

15
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,510
by very, very wrong type of people who had no idea

16
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,600
about Shri Krishna:

17
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:12,640
that He was a great master of wealth,

18
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,540
that He knew how to use the wealth and how to create

19
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,670
the wealth with dharma, not with adharma.

20
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,680
They all forgot about it completely

21
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,570
and gradually started using maneuvering powers,

22
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:45,600
all kinds of, all kinds of adharmic things -- cheating, grabbing

23
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:54,500
money, spending their money in absolutely useless things.

24
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,620
He is Kubera. He doesn't need any money, of course,

25
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,710
He achieves money;

26
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,510
and not only that,

27
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,520
He is living, He lived in money.

28
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,660
They said that He created a golden house for Him,

29
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,580
absolutely made with gold in Dwarika,

30
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,620
but it submerged in the water,

31
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:37,600
in the sea, and nobody believed that it is true.

32
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,600
But now they have found out His house under the water,

33
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,530
very deep waters,

34
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:52,530
so all their conjecture about Him was wrong, all false;

35
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,700
that He was definitely a man who made lots of money

36
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,700
by dharma.

37
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,550
Also He was a son of a king, and He built this Dwarika

38
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,540
out of gold.

39
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,630
It is still there and people have found it,

40
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,660
but under the sea.

41
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,500
Thousands of years have passed, but still existed.

42
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,700
Only because perhaps we belong to Shri Krishna,

43
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,570
it is still existing.

44
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,590
That's what it is, because He was the one

45
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,600
who was for satya first -- truth.

46
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:44,650
He was for truth, and He worked out everything

47
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,710
on the principle of truth.

48
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,540
Whatever was not truth, He tried to finish it off.

49
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,580
Whatever was destructive, He tried to remove that;

50
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:07,700
and He established Himself through truth only, truth only.

51
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,690
He's the one who represent the truth, absolute truth,

52
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,530
and how the truth can prevail in everything.

53
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,500
I'm just the opposite of Him because I don't understand

54
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,570
money at all,

55
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,500
but He's looking after that part in My life.

56
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,660
I'm so hopelessly bad --

57
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,740
I don't understand banking, I don't understand money,

58
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:46,570
I can't even count money. Now what can you say to that?

59
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,740
But He's there to look after,

60
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,730
and I've never a dearth of money, never a dearth of any

61
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,520
wealth, it's all full of it.

62
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,590
Also it comes through your sense of satisfaction.

63
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,680
If you have that sense of satisfaction,

64
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,730
you don't look for money.

65
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,660
What happened in your country that some people got money.

66
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,530
If you got little money, then you get the taste of money.

67
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,540
They're not satisfied people.

68
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:33,700
So like mad they went on spending on nonsensical things.

69
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,680
It is something very much human.

70
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,730
After your human evolution,

71
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,560
after you have reached a certain state of enlightenment,

72
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:54,740
then all these demeaning things like greed

73
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,590
all disappear from your character.

74
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,680
You don't have that greed in you anymore

75
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,510
and you become extremely a satisfied person.

76
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,730
To you money is there, all right, but it's not so important.

77
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:23,630
It is just that you think don't need it, and you'll get it --

78
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,740
all done by Shri Krishna all over, can you imagine?

79
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,620
He's doing all this, looking after you

80
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,740
and helping you with money.

81
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,710
We started Sahaja Yoga without a single pai.

82
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I don't, never had any problem.

83
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:51,590
So one thing, as Kubera He's the supplier of wealth.

84
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,520
He looks after people who don't have money.

85
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,560
He gives money to people who stand by truth,

86
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,650
who enjoy the life of truth.

87
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:19,680
It is His work that people enjoy wealth, otherwise they don't.

88
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,640
They have this much, they want to have more;

89
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,650
that means they don't enjoy the wealth.

90
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,540
They have a little, they want to get much more. Why?

91
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,590
Because they are not enjoying whatever they have.

92
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,650
But after Self-realization you will see that you enjoy

93
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,650
whatever you have.

94
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,600
You enjoy it fully, absolutely,

95
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,610
and you don't hanker after something that is not there.

96
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,520
Doesn't matter if you don't have.

97
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,510
Many a times people have asked Me,

98
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,650
"Mother, why not we have the puja of Krishna as Kubera?"

99
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,620
I said, "All right.

100
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,570
Just now everybody's trying to become Kuber.

101
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,660
Let them learn a lesson,

102
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,670
and then we will have the puja of Kubera."

103
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,560
And that's why today I've agreed to have this puja.

104
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,620
Because now you have seen what happens if you have greed.

105
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,650
You go on committing all kinds of sins,

106
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:34,510
all kinds of wrong things which can destroy your country.

107
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,740
Such a rich country has now become a poor country.

108
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,660
Where is that money gone?

109
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,550
They're very clever.

110
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,740
Somebody told Me today that this money with the insurance.

111
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,620
"My God," I said, "the law is such that

112
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,730
you can't get out that money."

113
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,580
Secondly they said that it is in offshore and all that.

114
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:01,560
I said, "But see now, they were never afraid

115
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,730
that they'll be caught up,

116
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,540
and they continued for so many years.

117
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,580
But I'm sure one day

118
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,670
they'll all be exposed by Kubera Himself."

119
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,590
So today by worshipping Kubera what we are doing,

120
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:30,580
we are going to establish, establish the truth of money,

121
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,510
what lies behind the money,

122
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:45,500
what is the point of having money.

123
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,540
This country had money.

124
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,660
As a result so many good people came here to work,

125
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,570
and you had so many complementary things.

126
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,680
You had lots of people who have complemented,

127
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,500
because I think in certain things Americans were little less;

128
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,580
not in intelligence, but in brilliance I think

129
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,720
they were little bit lacking.

130
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,550
So they got very brilliant people from abroad,

131
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,680
and also they were very focused people,

132
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,610
so they worked it out very well.

133
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,540
Also they respected people who came with brains.

134
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,720
So this is what happens when you forget

135
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,510
that truth is the main point.

136
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:41,520
If you don't have the truth, no use having money.

137
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,500
Because what you did was to go around with this thing,

138
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:52,650
that thing, I mean all kinds of things, to just get money.

139
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,670
The other day I was traveling through Las Vegas -- last year.

140
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,620
And when we stopped at that airport

141
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,540
so many people walked into the aeroplane,

142
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,690
and they all were looking as if somebody's dead

143
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,680
in their family or what has happened.

144
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,560
First I couldn't understand.

145
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,620
Then said, "Mother, they have lost all their money."

146
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,610
So when they have money, they are jumping, next moment

147
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,740
they are crying because they have lost the money.

148
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,620
What's the use of such a money

149
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,510
which is so temporary, which is so useless?

150
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,740
But that is human nature, to run after maya.

151
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:47,510
And this is the quality of money, that it gives you maya.

152
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,590
Maya like this, that they get a little money somehow;

153
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,710
with that little money, they buy something.

154
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,560
Then they think money is very important.

155
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,600
You see, you can buy lots of things,

156
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,610
you can buy cars, you can buy airplanes, this, that.

157
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,620
So there is where maya plays on you, and you start running

158
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,510
after that mad money which makes you mad.

159
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,720
It's nice that at this juncture they have discovered

160
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,700
the falsehood of this maya money.

161
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:30,520
And I am so happy that they were all handcuffed,

162
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:36,510
and all their power of money was finished.

163
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,620
So, this Kubera is working out all these tricks.

164
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,580
Krishna is a very tricky, extremely tricky personality.

165
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,740
He puts the tricks, every action after every action.

166
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,580
Now money matters:

167
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,510
He first befools you that you run after it,

168
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,680
and then you just discover that it was stupidity.

169
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,500
We have a story in our land, country, called "Sheikh Chili."

170
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,580
He got little money,

171
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,560
and he got into the grab of this maya.

172
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,720
So he thought, "I can do very well."

173
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,520
So he started dreaming as to what he should do.

174
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,540
So he went and bought lots of eggs and he said,

175
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:39,540
"Now these eggs will have little, little chicks which will grow,

176
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,590
which will I'll sell and I'll so much money,"

177
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,600
and it was like that he was talking.

178
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,730
And while thinking about it in his mind went off to sleep,

179
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,690
and then in his sleep he fell on the eggs

180
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,580
and all the eggs broke.

181
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,630
So the maya was over.

182
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,600
This should happen early, but if it doesn't happen

183
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,600
then you end up in the jail or something like that.

184
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:17,520
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which gives you a complete vision,

185
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,570
complete vision of the destruction

186
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:25,510
that can follow this maya business.

187
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,570
It is something, such a insight

188
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,600
that you don't have to do anything with it.

189
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,510
I'm different, I told you I don't understand it at all.

190
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,510
But even if you understand the value of money,

191
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,520
even if you understand that money can bring

192
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,590
lots of things to you, despite that you don't look at it,

193
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:57,660
just turn your face -- that is the sign of a real Sahaja yogi.

194
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,580
To him it doesn't matter, temperamentally.

195
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,520
It's not that he does something for that or tells his mind, nothing;

196
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:11,560
temperamentally he doesn't care for money,

197
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,640
just because he's above it.

198
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,670
The one who is above money is a real Sahaja yogi.

199
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,700
The one who is engulfed in the nonsense

200
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,520
and the maya of money is not a Sahaja yogi.

201
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,630
Of course I have seen most of the Sahaja yogis

202
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,500
are extremely honest, specially in the West.

203
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,620
But in India there's a disease: as you have some here viruses,

204
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,600
we have certain viruses in India also.

205
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,510
So they still go on running after money,

206
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,630
to them money is important.

207
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,720
But in the evolutionary process if you reach a certain state

208
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,640
where you rise above your Nabhi Chakra,

209
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,500
rise your Nabhi Chakra, then money's not so important.

210
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,670
It's not so important.

211
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:16,530
To Me, I find I cannot buy things unnecessarily.

212
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,730
Of course I mean there are so many unnecessary things

213
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,640
gathered, because you people give Me here presents, this that.

214
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:30,500
But Myself, you'll be amazed, I'm so nervous or I should say

215
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,620
hesitant, or you may call it absolutely absent from the spot

216
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,600
where they are doing any business, any purchasing.

217
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,740
Come here and fix it please.

218
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,670
It falls down, so I'm holding on!

219
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,590
Correct, now all right.

220
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:13,690
In the same way, Sahaja yogis have to fix their mind

221
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,710
to their spirit,

222
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:30,590
and enjoy the powers of your spirit, your own.

223
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:37,560
That enjoyment once you get it, you don't fall to your greed.

224
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,530
This is something

225
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,500
very, very simple,

226
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,580
but sometimes you don't do it.

227
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,510
You get enamored by something, maybe a car,

228
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,620
maybe aeroplane, I don't know what -- whatever it is.

229
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,520
It's a headache to have too many cars, isn't it?

230
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,640
But people have;

231
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,560
they think by that people are impressed,

232
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,650
and they think no end of themselves or not -- nothing.

233
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,720
If they are impressed, what is the use to us?

234
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,700
What do you get out of it?

235
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:24,620
Sahaja yogi has his own spirit to enjoy,

236
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,600
more than anything else.

237
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,720
He doesn't want to possess anything.

238
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,520
It's a headache to possess things also.

239
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,610
The other side of it is a Mahalakshmi.

240
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,680
If that principle is within you, Mahalakshmi Principle,

241
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,700
you'll have never a problem of money.

242
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,580
On the contrary, you'll know how to stop it.

243
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,720
So far as I am concerned,

244
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,640
I get fed up of My Mahalakshmi Principle

245
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,610
because I don't know from where it works out,

246
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:05,640
how it works out, without any effort.

247
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,740
But the temperamentally, I have no interest at all,

248
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,700
temperamentally.

249
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:23,620
But it is the, I don't know what is the cause of this effect.

250
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,510
Now supposing I buy some small thing, just like that,

251
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,720
it will sell at least ten times more.

252
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:38,660
It will be of value at least ten times more, I don't know how.

253
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:45,630
It's very surprising -- automatically.

254
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:53,500
I'll buy something very small, then I find it's very expensive.

255
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,720
How it works, just must be miracles of Mahalakshmi, I think.

256
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,660
So what I have to tell you is this,

257
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,690
that you should not worry about your financial situations

258
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,530
at all.

259
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,590
Do not go on calculating,

260
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,500
do not see how much money you have in the bank,

261
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,500
what you have to do with your money,

262
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,640
where you should invest.

263
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,500
I have seen people going mad planning the whole thing.

264
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,590
There's no need to do that once you are a Sahaja yogi.

265
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,500
It all works automatically.

266
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,590
The greed is within you, just like any other disease.

267
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,550
As you have diseases, greed is also there.

268
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:47,640
As your diseases can get cured with Sahaja Yoga,

269
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:56,730
your diseases, as much as your greed is, it vanishes.

270
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,650
You don't know what is greed is.

271
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,620
The only way to counter-balance is to become extremely

272
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,590
generous.

273
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,520
If you are extremely generous, greed will run away.

274
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,620
That may be another way of doing it.

275
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:25,550
Supposing you get something in your house

276
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,570
and you think it is too much.

277
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,530
Not to get rid of it but just to think it's too much,

278
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,550
you should give it to someone; you just start thinking,

279
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,550
whom can you give?

280
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,740
And immediately you'll remember,

281
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,600
"Oh, that person doesn't have this. Let me give him this."

282
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,660
And if you give him he'll be so thankful, so thankful,

283
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,610
and he'll say all kinds of nice things to you

284
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,500
which normally nobody would say to you, nobody.

285
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:06,590
And it's surprising how joy-giving it is,

286
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:11,540
how people like your generosity.

287
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,660
So you have to be generous, just generous;

288
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,630
not with yourself, but with others.

289
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,550
As much as possible, be generous.

290
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:32,590
Generosity is very love-giving, one of the expressions

291
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,590
of your love.

292
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,690
Many a times it has happened with Me

293
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:44,690
that I saw somebody needed something,

294
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,580
and kept it in My mind.

295
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,590
Then I bought that thing and gave it to that person.

296
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:58,640
And the amount of love that person gave Me

297
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,540
was thousand time more

298
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:09,500
than what I would have got joy out of buying it, by that thing.

299
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:13,600
It was so insipid for Me, but for him it was.... He told so

300
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,540
many people, "Mother gave me this. Mother gave me."

301
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,720
I mean, I was surprised.

302
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,680
Then they asked Me, "Mother, how did You give him?"

303
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,670
I said, "Just out of love."

304
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,580
Many people took to Sahaja Yoga thinking,

305
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,530
"What a generosity is!"

306
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,720
So to be generous is the best way to live in this world.

307
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,500
After all it's a headache to have too many things.

308
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:47,710
Better to get rid of them, but out of love.

309
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,680
If you do that,

310
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:56,580
you'll be know how much they'll be appreciative of you.

311
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:04,700
Another thing is, to get greed of, to get rid of greed

312
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,620
you should try to do some sort of a collective social work.

313
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,650
Supposing you go to some place where lots of poor people

314
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:22,610
are there, I tell you your greed will just drop out.

315
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,740
You'll be amazed how these people are living,

316
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,530
in what conditions.

317
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,610
"Why do I care for all the wealth and everything?"

318
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,560
That will be just shocking.

319
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:39,620
Sometimes, you see, you see people

320
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,650
in India also in a very bad condition.

321
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,670
Once I went to Calcutta

322
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:54,700
and I was so -- somehow or other you see by chance,

323
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,540
I happened to be in places where people were very, in a very,

324
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,650
very great poverty, even the children.

325
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,710
And you'll be amazed, for days together I wouldn't eat My food.

326
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,540
I was crying and not eating My food, I just didn't know

327
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,600
what to do.

328
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,720
Because I felt, "What is this?

329
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,620
Why these people are so poor?"

330
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,620
And I was helpless so I was crying,

331
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:33,600
that one day I should try to do something for them.

332
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,510
It is really remarkable, at a very young age of Mine

333
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:47,560
I started a leper home, I started a infirmary, a refugee home,

334
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,620
all kinds of things.

335
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:57,710
And I never even thought that whatever money I have,

336
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:06,570
if I give to these people I may have to give up some things.

337
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,640
I also sold some of My things,

338
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:14,630
because so pleasure-giving I tell you, so pleasure-giving,

339
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:18,660
so joy-giving to be generous.

340
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:26,560
It is so pain in every way that you should be generous.

341
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,670
That is the quality of Kubera.

342
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,570
He's an extremely generous personality,

343
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,640
and that's what's personality you should be.

344
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,650
So, I've seen that Sahaja yogis are very generous.

345
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:50,510
So far nobody has told Me that somebody is a miserly fellow --

346
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,600
so far, so far.

347
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,740
But I'm sure one day will come when we'll have people

348
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,510
of very high quality.

349
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,580
In Sahaja Yoga we don't say like other cults say that

350
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:14,630
you give up your clothes, you give up your family, you stay,

351
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,740
stay in a forest or in a hut or anything -- nothing of the kind.

352
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,620
Don't give up anything.

353
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,720
You have to give up from your heart.

354
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,720
Just it should happen in your personality;

355
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,710
don't have to give up.

356
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:44,510
And if you have that well-built in spirituality,

357
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:52,560
you'll not even think of grabbing someone.

358
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,600
On the contrary,

359
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,690
you would like to give up everything.

360
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,560
My father was even worse than Me, I should say.

361
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:07,630
He always used to leave the house open, all doors open.

362
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,640
He said, "No thief will come in if you keep the doors closed."

363
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,610
So one day a thief came

364
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,660
and he took away his gramophone -- in the old times,

365
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,690
these big horn ones -- he took away.

366
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,660
The next day My father was sitting, very sad.

367
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,600
So My mother asked him,

368
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,630
"Why are you sad, because of the gramophone?"

369
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:35,620
"No, I'm only sad because it seems he is a connoisseur of

370
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:42,610
music, he has taken the gramophone but no records."

371
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,740
So My mother said, "All right, what should we do?

372
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,560
Should we advertise in the newspaper that you take away

373
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,710
your records?"

374
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:01,570
I mean, it's such a beauty, that even after so many years

375
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,720
I am telling you and you are enjoying.

376
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,720
What a beautiful character it was of generosity.

377
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,530
But if you force it through religion,

378
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:20,500
through any such ideas that "you give up that, you give" --

379
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,510
don't have to give up.

380
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,640
You give up from within.

381
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:32,620
If you are not attached to it, you have given up.

382
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,560
That much should be there and if you all enjoy your

383
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,700
generosity and charity, nothing like it!

384
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,700
I have known people who are very rich and all that,

385
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,540
but they lack generosity.

386
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,660
That is another quality of Kubera.

387
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:58,690
He perhaps understand banking, perhaps.

388
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,550
That time there were no banks but I think must be,

389
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,530
because the way He manages banks, you know,

390
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,580
it seems to Me that He's sitting on top of them,

391
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,510
and that's why still in the banks there is no problem.

392
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,710
I don't know.

393
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:23,590
But He's a very clever person,

394
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,720
very intelligent,

395
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,610
very alert,

396
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:36,650
which is important if you have to deal with money --

397
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,550
though He was absolutely detached from money.

398
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,520
And just see His life, what He did.

399
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:51,540
He lived in childhood with His guru,

400
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,660
and He used to take

401
00:33:54,540 --> 00:34:03,620
what you call the cows and herds outside in the jungles.

402
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:11,630
That is how He lived in His childhood, and later on

403
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,730
He was playing with the boys

404
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,730
who were looking after the cows in a very,

405
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,570
I mean, ordinary family.

406
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,620
He never hankered after money.

407
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,730
He used to steal,

408
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,520
used to steal the butter,

409
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:50,620
because these ladies used to sell these to Kamsa's

410
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,550
military people.

411
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,600
So He used to eat that,

412
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,530
so that this lady should not give it to them.

413
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,590
Just imagine, such a little boy like Him.

414
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:15,610
So actually, how He was teaching them a lesson.

415
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,710
Those ladies were greedy, and wanted to give that

416
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,720
to these horrible soldiers,

417
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,570
and He would eat all that butter Himself.

418
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,620
In everything that He did,

419
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:37,650
what you see is extreme generosity, extreme generosity.

420
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,520
With all His intelligence He, He was so good.

421
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,700
And He killed

422
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,710
His own uncle, I should say;

423
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,590
but for Him it is, was not important,

424
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,660
so-called relations were not important.

425
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,660
But what you see in our India specially,

426
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,680
that relations are very important.

427
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,630
The father is a thief, his son is thief, his grandson is a thief,

428
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,590
all of them are thieves -- can you imagine?

429
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,590
I haven't seen in a family if there's one person who is a thief,

430
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:37,510
any one his progeny are honest.

431
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:42,670
It's a very funny thing, but such greed crawls into their minds

432
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:47,650
that they don't think is important.

433
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:53,650
They just think that stealing is the only way one can live.

434
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,690
Though in India there are people who are extremely honest.

435
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,580
I have seen our servants,

436
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,680
they never steal anything, nothing, never.

437
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,710
I don't know, they have no reasoning for it,

438
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,550
it's a matter of habit.

439
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:14,720
They never steal anything -- very surprising.

440
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,670
Why, why don't they steal?

441
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:26,630
They're happy with their lives, they don't want to change it.

442
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,510
They don't want to have these horrible things

443
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,690
that can put them in jail.

444
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,590
But they don't know,

445
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:42,500
they don't even think about it; just they just don't do it.

446
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:48,620
Why, because they have a sense of shame.

447
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,730
In the poorer peoples, sense of shame is very,

448
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,510
very developed.

449
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:03,550
In that society they have a great respect for people who are

450
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,540
honest, and they are all honest.

451
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,740
One of them may be not,

452
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,740
but they have no respect for such a person,

453
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,710
because they think self-respect is the biggest thing.

454
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,590
Can you imagine these poor people?

455
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,620
They have food once a day,

456
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,610
but to them their self-respect is above everything.

457
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,690
So the third solution for this kind of a nonsensical greed is

458
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,730
your self-respect.

459
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,640
Why should you steal,

460
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,570
why should you have anything that is stolen,

461
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,690
or why should you have anything that belongs

462
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,640
to another person?

463
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,670
If you have that self-respect within you,

464
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:02,580
you won't touch anything that is not yours.

465
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,710
When the servants can do that, why not people

466
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:11,560
who are not that badly off?

467
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:17,530
It is a temperament of a higher level, I think,

468
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,550
which they develop, where their self-respect

469
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,520
is much more important than all kinds of

470
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,620
other things that may satisfy their greed.

471
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:35,510
But one thing about greed is, it is never satisfied.

472
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,500
It is never satisfied.

473
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,500
I've seen people who were very rich once upon a time,

474
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,690
became very, very poor.

475
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,570
So to them life has become hell.

476
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:53,550
They can't live with, without their great,

477
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:59,640
I should say, pomp and show,

478
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,520
but they don't understand that it was false.

479
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:08,600
They just go on feeling extremely

480
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:13,650
downtrodden when they lose their money.

481
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,650
Then there are people who want to have money;

482
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:25,500
they'll do anything but get money.

483
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:31,650
It's a very funny thing, but also power is the same as that.

484
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,650
If you have your own powers,

485
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,660
you don't hanker after these powers.

486
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,730
But they want to have power because

487
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:44,650
they want to have money, and they get power with money --

488
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,620
can you imagine?

489
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,720
Where are human beings, at what level?

490
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,540
At what level of evolution they are?

491
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:58,740
They are going round and round the circle of this money.

492
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,690
This is Nabhi Chakra

493
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,590
which has to improve,

494
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,690
which gives you satisfaction.

495
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,520
If your Nabhi Chakra is satisfied,

496
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:16,600
you have achieved the state of Kubera.

497
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,500
That's very important, to see

498
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,730
that your Nabhi should be satisfied.

499
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,570
There are so many other kinds of things we have,

500
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:33,610
but I think now the worst is this greed.

501
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,630
And this, if it is managed somehow or other,

502
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,630
brought to its own level,

503
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:45,580
then I think world will improve very much.

504
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,510
May God bless you.
