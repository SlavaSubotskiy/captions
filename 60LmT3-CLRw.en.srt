1
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:33,070
From yesterday's program and all these days 
we must have realized that to get your Kundalini

2
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:53,470
working out, to get Her rush towards the Sahasrara 
and to widen your Shushumna Nadi it is not

3
00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:02,780
necessary that you should sit for meditation 
for 3 to 5 hours. Of course, you must meditate

4
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:20,369
for a short time because that is at a point 
where you are alone one with your God. But

5
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:29,640
otherwise in the collective when you emerge 
into it then the Kundalini rises the same

6
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:48,189
way. It's a very discrete way of understanding 
what happens. In the collective when you are,

7
00:01:48,189 --> 00:02:01,340
you compensate each other, compliment each 
other and the subtler side of the cosmos starts

8
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:10,399
manifesting in you. Then if you could really 
emerge there is a word 'emerge' in Sanskrit

9
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:22,850
language or in Marati language is very good 
is [Ramamana?]. I don't think emerging with

10
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:34,870
joy but there is no 'with' you see, emerging 
into joy. So if you can emerge into the joy

11
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:56,870
of anything that is Sahaj you can become a 
meditative personality. You can achieve that

12
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:12,129
meditative mood within yourself. With that 
mood, with that force, new subtler dimensions

13
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:24,709
start breaking out within you. Your different 
kind of conditionings, which are like, shackles

14
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:38,170
binding you down, just open out and you become 
a free person - 'Bandhamukta'. With that force

15
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:53,750
everything breaks, your ego breaks, your conditioning 
breaks and you become one with the joy of

16
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:59,879
life, divine life.

17
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:21,190
This you can experience but to retain it within 
yourself is only possible if you do your practices

18
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:36,170
in Sahaja Yoga. To control your attention, 
to keep your attention to higher values, to

19
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:57,970
the higher things. Let us see what are we, 
low value system that we get into 
which is regarded as something very important

20
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:17,720
otherwise. The first in the modern times is 
the consciousness of time. What is the time

21
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,820
now? What time we have to reach? Oh God what 
is the time we are going to start it? What

22
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:31,120
time are we going to sleep? Now we have experienced 
that yesterday we went home about 6 o'clock

23
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:39,760
and slept at 6 if we slept at all. You were 
quite tired till 2 o'clock I think then that

24
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:53,650
Mumbai business started and you again relived 
the whole sequence with a greater gust I must

25
00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:01,580
say. So at that time those people who try 
to keep dignity and try to keep out of it

26
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:11,180
are still keeping down their conditionings. 
Supposing there is a man who is a governor,

27
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:19,410
for example, quite healthy, young can dance. 
I mean old people need not do all that but

28
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:26,650
at least they can break through very well 
into the barriers of conditionings. But such

29
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:35,520
a person start thinking what's this going 
on and oh, nonsense, how can I join this?

30
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:45,400
It looks very rustic, sometimes looks something 
not very decent, decorous, looks like a world's

31
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:59,130
mud. It's extremely natural and child like, 
innocent. You can make out the people who

32
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:08,360
are still in the barrier. They even find it 
difficult to say Jai Mataji! Such people are

33
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:15,210
still bound down by the shackles of the worldly 
life.

34
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:20,100
Then they are all the time, seeing the time, 
what is the time? And again getting a headache

35
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,860
and such time you should never see the time. 
Because you will get a headache if you see

36
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:37,580
it, realizing itâ€™s very late you see, and 
oh God, it's 4 o'clock we are still here.

37
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:44,770
So it is important for all of us not to have 
any watches, even if we have, not to see them.

38
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:57,000
Or even you see them they should be stopped. 
So you go beyond time. You go beyond time.

39
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:10,830
You don't feel the time. You don't feel the 
tiredness of time and you just forget yourself,

40
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:17,940
which is tied down by time all the time.

41
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:29,430
Now then the second one is we talk so much. 
Oh we should have no religions, no jati, no

42
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,370
[party?], like that we say, all of us, you 
should have no caste system, the Indians especially.

43
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,260
The caste system is the curse. People will 
talk like that and when it comes to their

44
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:45,779
daughters' wedding they will not go beyond 
their caste. Caste system is bad. Your religion

45
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:53,180
is bad, this is bad, that bad but when it 
comes to actual understanding of religion,

46
00:08:53,180 --> 00:09:02,050
you can easily scratch them and find out from 
where they come. Once all conditionings of

47
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:19,860
so called religions 
and this has to be broken completely because 
they are all false, based on something solid.

48
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:28,649
Supposing you have a very solid foundation 
on that you put up a house of, say pack of

49
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:36,110
cards, like they say, how long it is going 
to last? If you go to the foundations you

50
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:42,339
find all the foundations are just the same 
but these pack of cards are different and

51
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:50,000
they are the greatest delusions for human 
beings which I've seen everyday, in every

52
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,759
religion, in every country, in every caste 
but still we are frightened of something nonsensical,

53
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:06,639
something historical or I don't know what? 
We don't want to give up that. That shows

54
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:23,870
another very big binding force to very low-grade 
life. I mean, say two caste people meet, same

55
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:32,269
people, how will they talk? Oh so you are 
of the same caste you see. Then you must be

56
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:37,360
knowing this man, yes, yes, yes, my father's 
brother's, this thing, this thing in Marati

57
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:49,589
this thing called [Sat ka. Sat lakia Sat ka?] 
(Shri Mataji is talking in Marati)

58
00:10:49,589 --> 00:11:01,470
like that. Oh, so you are the cousin sister's, 
this thing that thing, real husband?

59
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:09,329
And such terrible talks. I don't know, they 
go on for hours together and then I don't

60
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:19,249
know what is the satisfaction out of it. Then 
ultimately they this this they they find out

61
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:30,379
sometimes or mostly that both of them are 
related to a [decoit? decoy?] or a thug or

62
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:38,720
some sort of a bankrupt or some sort of a 
horrible man and then they recede back. Then

63
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:49,569
they don't want to show any relationship. 
So this kind of a nonsensical talks, for example,

64
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:54,319
if the ladies meet oh, they will say, where 
did you buy this Sari? I bought it there.

65
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:59,600
Oh, I went there how much you pay it? She 
said this, such waste of time, goes on, on,

66
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:10,079
on, on and on. The whole life is wasted in 
such a low-grade understanding of life's swell.

67
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,749
Then they will also talk these and do this 
and I mean you can build upon that, all the

68
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:22,050
filth. It's something like the fungus growing 
from the dead with little heat the fungus

69
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:27,649
starts growing, mutation takes place and the 
fungus becomes an aggressive and can become

70
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:43,180
cancerous, this that and the same way all 
these low grade life starts.

71
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:52,949
Then this low-grade life can extend in every 
walk of life, like politics, economics, everywhere,

72
00:12:52,949 --> 00:13:02,980
because it is like plastic. Plastic can get 
into cloth, can get into trees, can get into

73
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:11,939
everything. In the same way this horrible 
low-grade business goes into these various

74
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:27,490
things and a person can not rise above this 
built in plastic bondages we have. At this

75
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:42,579
time when we have such kind of programs everything 
breaks off and you really dissolve into the

76
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:53,160
love of God. There are so many other mundane 
things if you see how people talk and how

77
00:13:53,160 --> 00:14:00,550
they joke and all that. You think its all 
filth going around you, slowly, you will gradually

78
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:11,259
recede from it. That is how you prepare yourself 
for retaining this joy within yourself.

79
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:19,699
Now we are coming at the [fag?] end of our 
tours and when you will be going to your countries,

80
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:28,189
you should see for yourself what's happening 
around and just laugh and get out of it. You

81
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:37,269
have to remember those beautiful days in Ganapatipulle 
and you have to get into that mood and know

82
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:47,480
that you belong to the kingdom of God. I know 
we had very little time to talk but music

83
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,240
was even better. I could communicate better 
through music to you. I am working on you

84
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:00,300
all the time. But still there are some people 
who are caught up. I will request you for

85
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,110
all the leaders who find out there are any 
caught up people in their groups. Please don't

86
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,970
call them for the Pujas. They should be kept 
back if you think they are not all right.

87
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,290
And they should not also feel bad because 
they will be helped, they will be helped much

88
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,439
more if they don't come to the Puja.

89
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:23,740
So tomorrow is a great day for our Puja. I 
hope it will be convenient for all of you

90
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:30,839
to come and be seated here. I think tomorrow 
before coming to the Puja don't talk too much

91
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:38,629
and don't discuss too much. I think you must 
have had enough discussions today and have

92
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:39,470
reached some conclusions. I would like to 
know if some questions were not answered.

93
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:39,790
If there is any I would like to answer them 
now and after that we start our program for

94
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,029
5 minutes is sufficient for answering, all 
answered? Is there any questions that was

95
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:40,300
not answered? Please stand up, I can't see. 
Is there anybody? Oh, ho, that's Sahaj. Sahaj

96
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:40,450
people have no questions. They have to only 
answer.
