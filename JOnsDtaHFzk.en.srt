1
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:34,470
Today is a great day of Mahalakshmi Puja.

2
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:38,830
Mahalakshmi is an incarnation

3
00:02:38,902 --> 00:02:44,701
of the Lakshmi, the power of Vishnu.

4
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:49,273
She only incar­nated.

5
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:33,314
This Mahalakshmi principle

6
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:36,065
is born out of the Lakshmi,

7
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:41,494
who is the power of Sri Vishnu.

8
00:03:53,393 --> 00:03:57,201
When in a human being

9
00:03:57,272 --> 00:04:05,236
the desire to rise higher comes in,

10
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:12,428
the Lakshmi principle becomes the Mahalakshmi principle.

11
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,095
Like in the West we can say,

12
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:21,785
people have affluence of Lakshmi,

13
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:26,607
so they wanted to rise above that principle

14
00:04:26,673 --> 00:04:32,377
and become Mahalakshmi.

15
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:44,457
In the awareness it acts on the matter like aesthetics;

16
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:47,610
people worry more about aesthetics

17
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:53,211
than about possessions.

18
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:00,005
And when they start growing

19
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:03,937
higher and higher in their awareness of seeking,

20
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,089
then they find that

21
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:14,191
the attention should be such,

22
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:18,140
that they should pay more im­portance

23
00:05:18,204 --> 00:05:20,696
to the aesthetics of things

24
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,646
than to the gross values.

25
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:41,134
Now when this desire becomes

26
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:44,166
evident in human beings,

27
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:51,009
then only Lakshmi incarnates as Mahalakshmi.

28
00:05:56,652 --> 00:06:00,727
So She incarnated as Mahalakshmi

29
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:05,913
when Rama came on this earth, first time.

30
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:17,015
And also She incarnated as Radha

31
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:21,418
when Shri Krishna came on this earth.

32
00:06:24,338 --> 00:06:26,743
And when She came as Mary,

33
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:29,218
it was Mahalakshmi

34
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:35,076
who bore the child that is Lord Jesus Christ.

35
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:45,572
So the child She bore

36
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:52,362
was the great personality, of Mahavishnu.

37
00:06:59,562 --> 00:07:06,292
This Mahavishnu-tattwa is also represented,

38
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:08,697
or we can say has an aspect,

39
00:07:08,737 --> 00:07:13,553
of others, which in­carnated on this earth

40
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,807
as two children of Sita.

41
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:31,176
They incarnated as

42
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:38,084
Mahavira and Buddha, as Hassan and Hussein.

43
00:07:40,996 --> 00:07:46,660
Also at the time of the prophets

44
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:50,705
Mahalakshmi incarnates as

45
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,195
a pure relationship with them.

46
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:03,889
Like Raja Janaka’s daughter was Janaki,

47
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:07,989
means Sita;

48
00:08:08,092 --> 00:08:13,479
then She came on this earth

49
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,507
as the daughter of Mohammed Sahib;

50
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,039
and then She came on this earth as Nanaki,

51
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:24,766
the sister of Nanaka.

52
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:42,731
So She resides as a pure relationship

53
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:47,149
of these gurus.

54
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:57,286
Thus the Mahalakshmi’s greatness is that,

55
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,367
through Her power only the Sushumna

56
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:04,878
is cover­ed by Kundalini.

57
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:15,007
She is the power of our evol­ution.

58
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:17,675
And by Her power only

59
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:20,367
we have risen to be human beings

60
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,052
and by Her son’s power

61
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:27,811
we are going to become higher people.

62
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,114
Thus the impor­tance of Mahalakshmi is very great

63
00:09:39,154 --> 00:09:44,396
for all the Sahaja Yogis.

64
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:48,288
Because She guides our Vishnu tattwa

65
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,859
to its culmination, to its completion,

66
00:09:56,464 --> 00:10:02,821
which is the principle of our evolution.

67
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:05,823
Thus She is a giver of Dharma,

68
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,900
She gives us the Dharma and

69
00:10:08,926 --> 00:10:14,688
She is the giver of the truth.

70
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,698
She is the one who relates us to our brain,

71
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:25,637
the whole brain’s system is Mahalakshmi’s system.

72
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:31,243
So it is She who exposes

73
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:36,408
the whole of the knowledge as truth to us,

74
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:41,179
on our central nervous system.

75
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:46,923
But at the state of Virata,

76
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:50,202
when Vishnu becomes the Virata,

77
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:55,325
the great primordial being,

78
00:10:55,381 --> 00:11:02,053
then She is called as Viratangana, as his power.

79
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:14,630
So these are the incarnations of Mahala­kshmi

80
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:19,136
about which I have told.

81
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:29,857
There’s so much can be said about this Mahalakshmi­tattwa;

82
00:11:30,016 --> 00:11:32,528
you are all blessed so much by that.

83
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,282
And so today we remember

84
00:11:35,368 --> 00:11:39,817
Her great in­carnation as Maria,

85
00:11:39,904 --> 00:11:43,102
who was very great because

86
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:47,070
She had to bear terrible pain in Her heart

87
00:11:47,118 --> 00:11:50,056
with all Her powers that She had,

88
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:53,166
She was a tremendously powerful Lady.

89
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:57,655
But despite that, She bore all the tortures

90
00:11:57,782 --> 00:12:03,186
of Christ upon Her heart.

91
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:08,398
And it was Her order and Her desire

92
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:12,434
that Christ had to crucify Himself

93
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:17,765
so that people could be resurrected.

94
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:48,190
And sometimes Indians ask Me

95
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:51,418
what did She do to be a Mahalakshmi, what did She achieve?

96
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,561
I said: “With all Her powers to bear it.

97
00:12:54,592 --> 00:13:00,767
To play the drama it must be too much.”

98
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:19,312
So She is the redeemer and She connects you to God.

99
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,863
In the sense She is the bridge.

100
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:31,819
And the Kundalini rises over the bridge.

101
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:37,490
And Kundalini is the Mahakali.

102
00:13:37,562 --> 00:13:39,839
Now we have a temple in India

103
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:42,885
which you have visited of Mahalakshmi in Kolhapur;

104
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:46,663
and there, when they sing,

105
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:49,291
when they worship Mahalakshmi

106
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:51,479
at that time they say “udho, udho,Ambe”.

107
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,351
That time they say: “O Ambe, the Kundalini, you rise”.

108
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:10,504
But Kundalini is the potential of all the three powers:

109
00:14:10,544 --> 00:14:13,979
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati,

110
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:20,596
because it is the primordial desire.

111
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:25,735
Because She is the Holy Ghost, you see,

112
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,686
so She contains all these three powers in it.

113
00:14:34,328 --> 00:14:37,068
Like Adi Shakti has all the three powers

114
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,200
of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

115
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:46,976
So now today is a great day for us

116
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:49,812
because Mahalakshmi has helped us so much,

117
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:52,064
Her blessings are much.

118
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:54,710
She looks after all our well-­being,

119
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,155
She is the one who looks after

120
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,122
all our problems of redemption,

121
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:03,410
She is the one who gives us all the possible

122
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,268
help in our Chakras and correction of them.

123
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:09,078
And She is the one who gives us

124
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:13,458
all that is material or physical well­ being

125
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:18,151
so we have to be very very thankful to Her today.

126
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:20,889
You have to be grateful.

127
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:23,410
And also today is Gregoire’s birthday.

128
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:25,830
So I would like to congratulate him

129
00:15:25,894 --> 00:15:28,172
for making Me come to Munich

130
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:30,623
because we had such a tremendous programme

131
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:36,112
May God bless you all.
