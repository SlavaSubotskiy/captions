1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:21,990
but today I am going to tell you

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:26,070
something more which we have to it's

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:32,250
very important to know because as was

4
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:33,690
described by people that again the

5
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:43,470
practice sahaja yoga as they go to

6
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:49,379
church but is not from their heart and

7
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:55,229
heart the abode of the spirit is the

8
00:00:49,379 --> 00:01:02,030
Shiva within us so we have to know more

9
00:00:55,229 --> 00:01:02,030
about heart and that is very important

10
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:09,720
you know about these three noddies we

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:13,070
have me rapping de suzuna but in the

12
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,070
heart there are for nerds

13
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:26,520
and the one nerdy goes to mooladhara and

14
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,480
if you cross the limits of mooladhara it

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:34,230
goes to hell that's why they say that

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:39,480
Shiva is a destroyer actually you asked

17
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:48,960
for your destruction and when you asked

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:52,070
for your destruction you have it even if

19
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:57,450
it destroys everything as I was telling

20
00:01:52,070 --> 00:02:01,530
it's like when a fruit has to come the

21
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,510
petals look as if they're destroyed as I

22
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,119
have destroyed I would say many of your

23
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,550
things you can call it like your

24
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,649
conditionings your ego your rationalism

25
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,620
your fanaticism all this has been

26
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:17,070
destroyed it is a job

27
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:27,600
this has to be destroyed for the beauty

28
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:33,860
to come out so when your maryadas cross

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:40,410
beyond certain point you go to your

30
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:44,010
destruction in four directions

31
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:51,690
there are destructions made as there are

32
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:55,470
four NARAS so now what is to be done how

33
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:59,780
are we to stop this destruction of the

34
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,780
through the first daddy going to hell

35
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:07,709
one of the qualities of Shiva is that

36
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:10,500
his innocence this extremely innocent is

37
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:13,280
innocent like a child his innocence

38
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,280
personified

39
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:36,760
so we have to put our carnal desires

40
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:44,230
dissolve them dissolve them into the

41
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:46,630
innocence the ocean of innocence you

42
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:55,870
have to dissolve it in the ocean of

43
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:59,530
innocence innocence is something to be

44
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:03,100
appreciated to be understood to be

45
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:09,640
enjoyed like you see animals they're

46
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:15,000
innocent you see children they're

47
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:22,120
innocent flowers they are innocent

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:24,420
divert your attention to all these

49
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,420
things

50
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:37,229
you see unlocking on the street what is

51
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:43,229
there to see West is all like three feet

52
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:47,460
height you see at three feet height all

53
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:49,740
the flowers all the beautiful grass all

54
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,830
the children who are about three feet

55
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,180
are the best

56
00:04:51,830 --> 00:05:06,509
we need not see people who are above

57
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:09,689
that just see on three feet level you

58
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:15,240
can see the legs of somebody that's

59
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:19,340
alright but you don't see the eyes of a

60
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,340
person who are not innocent

61
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:33,680
so dissolve this desire a little antenna

62
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:38,870
cells and this mullet Aramis is innocent

63
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,870
is not dead finished but is innocent

64
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:45,710
it is righteous

65
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,710
it is recognizes qualities

66
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:53,140
it's pure so even if you are in this

67
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:57,300
world even if you are living like a

68
00:05:53,140 --> 00:06:05,710
human being even if you have children

69
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:09,490
still you are ignorant the second noreen

70
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:12,060
the second child that can take you to

71
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,170
destruction is desire

72
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,170
that's why Buddha said that

73
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:23,590
desirelessness is the only way that

74
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:25,540
people do not get old not sick not

75
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,619
worried

76
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,619
[Music]

77
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:39,360
now this desire that we have I want this

78
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,770
the West is much more than anywhere else

79
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,360
because the enterpreneurs are every day

80
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:52,710
producing new things desires can be of

81
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,710
any kind not only material the desires

82
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,440
could be also quite mental

83
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:08,589
I must possess this woman I must possess

84
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:13,359
this child all kinds of positions that

85
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:18,489
work into you as desires I wouldn't say

86
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:24,029
it is because of attachment it's not

87
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:24,029
attachment but it is just to have more

88
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:36,779
go on adding up things getting things

89
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:50,019
still one doesn't feel happy and

90
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:52,689
satisfied what is the reason for this

91
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:57,239
kind of desire is that it's not pure

92
00:07:52,689 --> 00:08:00,489
desire it's an impure desire

93
00:07:57,239 --> 00:08:03,989
it's an impure desire and when such a

94
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:07,479
desire starts working you can go any far

95
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:10,299
like Saddam Hussein like Hitler like

96
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:20,019
anything is nothing but absolutely

97
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:24,610
desired beyond any limitations you want

98
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:26,999
to dominate others is also another

99
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,999
desire

100
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:40,289
all these desires lead you ultimately to

101
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:47,200
a destruction because there's no joy

102
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:55,660
there's no happiness for example now I

103
00:08:47,200 --> 00:09:00,430
want to have a sorry so I want to buy

104
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:02,290
aside all my attention will be how we

105
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:06,570
like in that sorry I must get that sorry

106
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:11,140
this thing that thing the attention

107
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:13,959
becomes polluted disturbed for a

108
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:19,630
nonsensical thing like a sorry the

109
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:25,150
attention which has to enjoy which has

110
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:32,290
to enjoy the spirit which has to nourish

111
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:36,279
the spirit becomes disturbed because of

112
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:40,480
desires in the first place

113
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:45,940
the attention is disturbed because we

114
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:50,620
are not innocent in the second place the

115
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:53,160
attention gets into turmoil because we

116
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,160
have desire

117
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:07,800
so what should we do as far as the

118
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:16,470
desire is culture a desire for beautiful

119
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:20,459
things we can shift our desire material

120
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:24,709
desire into aesthetics I have one thing

121
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:24,709
but which is really aesthetically rich

122
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:36,240
so whatever you desire if you start it

123
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:40,120
working it out desiring for something

124
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,240
aesthetically handmade nicely

125
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,240
[Music]

126
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:51,180
gradually you'll find will end up with

127
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:56,580
vibrations because all beautiful things

128
00:10:51,180 --> 00:11:01,220
have vibrations and to have the

129
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,220
vibrations you have to go to pure desire

130
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:12,410
so this desire which is madness which

131
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:18,090
makes you mad which is so much darlin

132
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:21,360
boring becomes pure desire because you

133
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:24,000
have to dissolve all your desires into

134
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,990
vibration you to start desiring nothing

135
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,180
but vibrations after self so if you have

136
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:39,110
vibrations that doesn't mean that they

137
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:46,140
are something dry no it means the joy of

138
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:51,630
nothing Mukti is you cannot adoration

139
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:55,440
this that it's the ocean of love that is

140
00:11:51,630 --> 00:12:03,720
God you just get dressed into it there's

141
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:09,200
no word stood and that is what when you

142
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:18,450
feel you must know that you have taken

143
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:25,580
the spirit as a real connection between

144
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:25,580
you and your mother or your father

145
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:41,430
there's no differentiation you are one

146
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:45,300
in that ocean grazed in the ocean

147
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:50,040
you are the drop you are the ocean you

148
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:56,880
are one in that nothing and that but

149
00:12:50,040 --> 00:13:08,670
they cannot be mechanical because not

150
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:10,890
man-made so to enjoy sahaja yoga you

151
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:15,890
must know that it's not dry vibrations

152
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:21,600
only but misty bhakti

153
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:29,360
that is the joy of choise quality

154
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:32,300
quality of joy that he adds to our life

155
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:36,900
everything seems to be surrounded

156
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:40,830
resounding same thing the joy that I'm

157
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:47,330
loved so much by God that God God loves

158
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:54,830
me that I have a meaning in life then

159
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:58,840
the ego drops out first of all and also

160
00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:01,690
the conditionings drop

161
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:05,920
[Music]

162
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,920
now the third Nadi

163
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:16,580
[Music]

164
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:23,420
3rd Nadi is the Nadi by which we feel

165
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:28,130
attached attached to someone like this

166
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:33,890
is my child this is my husband this is

167
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:39,470
my family this is my wife this is my

168
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:42,220
father this is my mother in the

169
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:48,590
beginning of sahaja yoga of everyone

170
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:52,970
when they are just the beginners so they

171
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:55,100
talk about their whole family my father

172
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:58,040
is like this my mother is seeing my

173
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:02,410
mother sisters brothers these that's

174
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:05,840
real this thing is not right

175
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:12,340
as if you see we all have taken a

176
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:12,340
contract what should I do

177
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:19,250
so now this so-called limited love what

178
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:25,730
is the solution which takes you to

179
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:30,820
destruction is the unlimited because

180
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,820
Shiva is nothing but love is love

181
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:46,570
now is that corrects that nourishes that

182
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:53,140
wants your benevolence that's what you

183
00:15:46,570 --> 00:16:02,320
eyes it wants your benevolence it looks

184
00:15:53,140 --> 00:16:04,780
after your benevolence so when you are

185
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:15,460
looking after the benevolence of others

186
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:19,870
wait now then the whole life changes the

187
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:22,780
whole pattern changes and you really

the mud now I am aloneness that

199
00:17:15,489 --> 00:17:25,399
is the way you open the heart the Lotus

other anywhere is done you are agreeable

205
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:50,450
to that you don't think that it will be

206
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:57,429
done here or there or there but anywhere

207
00:17:50,450 --> 00:18:00,080
but should be all of us together so

208
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:04,519
they're small attachments that are with

209
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:08,979
you have to be dissolved into this ocean

210
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:08,979
of love which is Shiva

211
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:22,820
fourth one is the most important for all

212
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,410
of us is to know that there's a nerdy

213
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:29,840
which passes through the official

214
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:35,990
different into the heart starts from the

215
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:45,170
heart goes up passes through our gap it

216
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:49,970
has four petals opens up this is the one

217
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:55,550
which gives you the state which is

218
00:18:49,970 --> 00:19:00,020
called as thorium we live in three

219
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:03,350
states in the living in the awakened

220
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:05,270
state geography our attention goes to

221
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:12,800
these that and all that we spoiled our

222
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:17,000
attention but the second one is the one

223
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:22,400
what we call is that we sleep when we

224
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,410
sleep also all these things that have

225
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:29,120
happened come to us from our past and

226
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:34,250
things like that but then we go to the

227
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:41,270
deepest deep water specialty is a state

228
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:45,710
where we have deep sleep and you dream

229
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:47,630
of something that is reality also you

230
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:52,790
may dream about me

231
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:58,630
I kiss the ether a part of the

232
00:19:52,790 --> 00:20:01,010
subconscious where some beautiful

233
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:04,550
informations are passed or supposing I

234
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,410
come say Italy Italians might know in

235
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:10,370
their social tea that I've come here or

236
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:12,320
maybe anybody might know depends all but

237
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,929
the fourth state is called Astoria there

238
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,470
are two more states you are in notorious

239
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:22,610
state is the fourth today means fourth

240
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:25,210
for state is where that you are in a

241
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,210
thoughtless awareness

242
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:35,850
when there is no thought just think of

243
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:40,650
it when there is no thought you have to

244
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:44,100
be innocent when there is no thought you

245
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:47,330
have to have vibrations when there is no

246
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:50,370
thought you cannot be attached to anyone

247
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:53,430
so into that hot a state you have come

248
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:58,980
now is through the artistic thing but in

249
00:20:53,430 --> 00:21:04,020
this state when you are these four

250
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:09,540
petals which are within you have to open

251
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:21,770
out in your brain they come from your

252
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:21,770
heart to your brain and that is where

253
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:29,840
they absolutely understand what is God

254
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:50,159
absolutely no what is parties that is

255
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:52,579
the time when one receives the real

256
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,579
knowledge

257
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:04,920
but unless and until these four petals

258
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:09,270
open one may fall back that's where some

259
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:13,020
other sahaja Yogi's who are still

260
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:19,260
meddling with things if they should not

261
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:24,300
do wha and they don't understand what is

262
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:26,400
God is but it's not the understanding

263
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,560
you know you understand this one little

264
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:35,360
point that it comes from your heart

265
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:35,360
impure brain not from brain your heart

266
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:46,550
it comes as if the amarosa

267
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:52,740
of your body covers your brain

268
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:56,990
absolutely I will sure to achieve that

269
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,990
state my god
