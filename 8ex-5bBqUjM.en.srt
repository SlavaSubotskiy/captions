1
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:53,030
In India they were all waiting for the monsoons

2
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,230
and they are so worried

3
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,860
because the rain did not come.

4
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,900
So, I was giving bandhan to the rain and it came here

5
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,730
And now also they have  told,

6
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,860
on the television, that it is going to rain in India.

7
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,980
But first in Italy!

8
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,190
I was told that in Italy you needed rain very much

9
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,030
and the first rain you had,

10
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,900
few days back, and now this the second one.

11
00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:02,780
Because all the understanding

12
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:12,650
of the problems of our farmers is there.

13
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,650
And the rain, you see, is so kind

14
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:26,900
that it works at the right time.

15
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,190
I am surprised

16
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:38,530
at the quick behaviour and obedience of the rain.

17
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,070
Today is a great day, for all of us,  because

18
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,980
we are celebrating the Guru Puja

19
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,820
and remembering all the great Gurus

20
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:03,070
who came on this earth to teach the world about the truth.

21
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,900
So many of them were [there].

22
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,110
And they tried their level best

23
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,070
to explain to humanity what is spirituality.

24
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:23,570
But it’s such a disparity that people never understood

25
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,530
that spirituality is the most important thing we need.

26
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,820
That we have to be one with the Divine Power.

27
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,570
All their endeavours have been in the wrong direction.

28
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:46,860
First of course they were very intelligent, more than animals,

29
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:53,900
and started seeking, not the truth,

30
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,900
but some sort of a self

31
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,940
-emancipation I should say, I don’t know  what to say, call it –

32
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,940
self-progress.

33
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,860
And in that they lost that they have to first seek spirituality,

34
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,030
which is the most important thing.

35
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:24,730
But, we had two types of journeys:

36
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:34,610
one is through the left side or another through the right side.

37
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,650
In India, I don’t know why,

38
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:46,070
we had lots of people who went into the jungles and became saints

39
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,980
but they were doing right side tapasya.

40
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,940
That is, going into the five elements

41
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,940
one after another; and mastering the five elements.

42
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,860
Of course there is truth in it, no doubt.

43
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,070
You have seen how a candle

44
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:26,150
how a candle tells you as to what is your position inside:

45
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,650
if you are possessed or if you are not,

46
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,820
a candle can tell you – can you imagine?

47
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,820
Candle is so much knowledgable.

48
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:48,110
Supposing you have a heart, heart trouble –

49
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,730
the candle will show.

50
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:59,230
And if you treat yourself with a candle, you can cure yourself.

51
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,820
So, it is so sensitive

52
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,190
not that it can cure, but also so competent,

53
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,940
not that it shows you that you are sick and you have problems

54
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,900
but that it is competent to cure you.

55
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,780
Thats why, in India, Agni was worshipped,

56
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:33,690
this  light was worshipped,

57
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,780
the fire was worshipped, that was worshipped first.

58
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,690
They must have discovered that the fire knows everything,

59
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:54,820
so the inner, inner awareness of all these elements,

60
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:02,030
they knew about it and thats why they worshipped those elements.

61
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:10,900
So before the Puja they used to call all the Deities who belonged

62
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:17,110
to those elements to witness their Puja.

63
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,150
But that turned out to be right sided movement.

64
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:31,110
Without the left side right side is very dangerous.

65
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,860
If you don’t have right side of course

66
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,730
it’s a big dangerous thing also. But first you must have

67
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,860
development of your left side.

68
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,110
That is what, to begin with, we had in Sahaja Yoga.

69
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:03,030
Left side is compassion, is love, universal feeling,

70
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,780
or we can say it’s the blessings of the Devi

71
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,900
which are described you know it, in the Devi Mahatmyam,

72
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,780
that the Goddess resides within you as so many things.

73
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,940
She resides within you as shraddha.

74
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,900
as, She resides in you as sleep,

75
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,070
She resides in you as illusion, bhranti.

76
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,900
All kinds of things are there on the left-hand side,

77
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,150
which are already described.

78
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,570
And when I told you about Sahaja Yoga,

79
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,820
I wanted to make your left side very strong.

80
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,860
Those who, people who, took to right side

81
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,070
became very aggressive people, and they had mastered

82
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,780
the essence of these five elements, that’s alright. But

83
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,900
they were extremely hot-tempered,

84
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,980
so much so that they used to curse people, curse them.

85
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,820
They used to say things which were not kind;

86
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,650
and they didn’t believe in the universality.

87
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,110
It was such a dangerous thing that they took.

88
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,820
In Indian shastras you can see many incidents

89
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,230
where people gave a curse, sharp, very common.

90
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,820
All these gurus used to curse a person,

91
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,030
because they had no compassion, no love, nothing but they had powers

92
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,780
of the right side. But we have seen now

93
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,780
that those people who have right side,

94
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,110
who go only on the right side without the bhakti,

95
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:14,610
without the blessings of the Divine,

96
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,940
can become rakshasas actually,

97
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:26,150
can become a great danger for humanity.

98
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,230
This is a very serious thing:

99
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,780
through your intelligence, through your thinking power,

100
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,980
your ego can go to any limit

101
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,860
and create problems within you.

102
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,730
Now the ultimate of this problem is,

103
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,650
we have seen is, are many diseases,

104
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,860
which are absolutely incurable.

105
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,820
Even some people, right-sided, some people,

106
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,940
can get a kind of a cancer called blood cancer.

107
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,150
And this blood cancer, now we have cured it,

108
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,230
but even if it is cured you can go back

109
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,980
to that kind of aggressiveness

110
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,780
thinking that you are very right.

111
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,690
Such people always try to find faults with others,

112
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:41,530
that such and such person is not good, he’s doing harm,

113
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,730
or any way they can find faults with others, not with themselves.

114
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,900
Their attention is outside, not on themselves.

115
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,730
They never see what’s wrong with them,

116
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,980
but they always see what’s wrong with others.

117
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,780
By doing that, you see, they are climbing the ladder

118
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:05,980
of a horrible right side, which can give you horrible diseases.

119
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,650
As I’ve told you, first is the blood cancer.

120
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,900
If you get rid of the blood cancer then

121
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:22,030
you can get into another problems. Nowadays there’s a very famous

122
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,980
disease called Alzheimers.

123
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,980
This is also the side of the right side;

124
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,690
because if you don’t have that bhakti, that humility,

125
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,730
that blessings of the Goddess,

126
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,650
you can develop all such horrible diseases

127
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,690
which are not only fatal,

128
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,570
but also very injurious to others.

129
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:57,610
So by being right-sided you do not progress.

130
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,610
You can become a big ascetic, they call it,

131
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,110
who can curse others,

132
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:12,730
who can put them into troubles,

133
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,780
think that that is a great power – it is not!

134
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,230
It is not at all.

135
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:28,030
Because, though you are not suppressed

136
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,070
by other powers, negative powers,

137
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,650
but your own power takes your life.

138
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,650
So Kundalini, when it is arisen,

139
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,690
the best thing is to go to the left side,

140
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:57,530
not criticising others, not talking ill of others,

141
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,860
but seeing within you, what’s wrong.

142
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,230
Find out what is the matter with you.

143
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,150
First it starts with self-importance,

144
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,570
that “I am a very important person,”

145
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,690
and with this self-importance you go on

146
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,030
troubling everyone and torturing everyone, and all that.

147
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,570
But because of your right-side movement,

148
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,980
you can become very successful.

149
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,690
Hitler was the climax of that.

150
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:42,650
And that’s how people start taking to very, very cruel things.

151
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,690
Nowadays, I think that some people are

152
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:58,570
ruling  everywhere with their right side.

153
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:07,650
We do not have people who are using their left side.

154
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,900
And whenever they use their left side they are called as saints.

155
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,900
Now you all have the powers of the left side.

156
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:24,690
Some of you do have little bit right side also, doesn’t matter.

157
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,820
Now I would say that you have achieved

158
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,570
your left side mastery:

159
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,860
Kundalini awakening is there, you are one with the Divine.

160
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:46,110
Now you can come to the right side and know about right side,

161
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:52,570
and try to express your right side.

162
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,610
You can express it not by dominating others but dominating yourself.

163
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,070
By self-examination.

164
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,860
By understanding what’s wrong with you. Why do you behave like that?

165
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:13,860
Why do you trouble others? Why do you overpower others?

166
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,610
Such people will always, I have seen, organise

167
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,070
and arrange, and do this and do that.

168
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,030
Instead of organising themselves they’ll organise others.

169
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,980
These things complicate.

170
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:36,190
But if you have love and if you have bhakti,

171
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,690
you can very, very easily

172
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:48,780
dominate  others in a very different manner.

173
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:57,980
It is not that you dominate by cruelty,

174
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:05,820
by oppression, but you dominate with your love.

175
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,940
And you don’t want to dominate,

176
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,780
but easily people get very much succumbed

177
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:20,690
to love and to magnanimity, to generosity.

178
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,860
So all these qualities you must first develop within yourself:

179
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,650
is the left-side problem, that – you should be very peaceful,

180
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,820
you should give love to others, you should be generous,

181
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,690
you should be kind, and see how much it pays.

182
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,110
I’ve seen some people who are extremely rude,

183
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,900
they can be rude to anyone, that’s their nature,

184
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,570
which they should overcome with the left side.

185
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,110
Rudeness is not the sign of a saint.

186
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,030
A saint is extremely peaceful,

187
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,030
and never gets rude with others.

188
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,860
So the introspection should work first of all,

189
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,980
“Where are we wrong? What wrong things we are doing?

190
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,820
What is our style?”

191
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,820
Once you discover that your style is already left-side,

192
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,860
then you should take to right side

193
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,980
and possess the power of right side.

194
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,570
What are the powers of right side now

195
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,650
which are achieved through the left-side perfection?

196
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,900
We have some very great Gurus on this line.

197
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,900
One of them was Raja Janaka.

198
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,570
He was a ruler of a country,

199
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:11,030
and a very well-known ruler and everything; but still, still,

200
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,690
though He was so generous and good and everything,

201
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,730
but at the same time He was a great monarch,

202
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,070
great king of those days,

203
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:35,900
very much known for His impartiality,  for His statesmanship

204
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:42,110
and all kinds of beautiful things He did for His

205
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:51,570
subjects. That is there, is Raja Janaka.

206
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,110
He could not get disturbed with anything.

207
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,690
And people never understood

208
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,820
why the greatest of greatest saints used to bow to Him.

209
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,980
What was so great? Though He was a king, He was living so lavishly

210
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,570
and He had so many of ornaments and

211
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,780
also conveyances and all that;

212
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,980
because nothing was above Him,

213
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,980
He was so detached with everything.

214
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,650
He had everything, but He was so detached.

215
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,820
That’s a very good example of a person

216
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:37,570
who had mastered His left, and now who was the king,

217
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,690
Raja Janaka, was there.

218
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,860
Like that we had many people later on also,

219
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:50,820
one after another, who were extremely, extremely rich,

220
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:57,150
extremely, I should say, powerful as kings,

221
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,730
but inside they were

222
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:07,650
absolutely like divine personality.

223
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,650
Nothing disturbed them, nothing made them feel greater or happier.

224
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:20,780
No position, no power was to them great.

225
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:29,110
This is a complete emancipation of human beings,

226
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,730
that you are realised soul.

227
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:40,690
You should be fully equipped with compassion love and understanding.

228
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:46,860
But at the same time, it should be expressed in the right way.

229
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,690
For example, we can say Christ, He’s another example.

230
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,610
Though He was an Incarnation, still

231
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:05,940
the amount of forgiveness and love He has for people is tremendous.

232
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,690
But at the same time,

233
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,690
He used to go on the mountains and preach about spirituality.

234
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,690
Those were not very safe times,

235
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,940
because people didn’t like anybody talking like that.

236
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,900
They hated Him because He talked about God.

237
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,820
And what they did to Him you know very well.

238
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,570
Doesn’t matter.

239
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,940
Though they crucified Him, still

240
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,030
we all respect Him as a great personality.

241
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:47,570
Reason is, He was, He was no doubt an Incarnation,

242
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:54,650
but still He went all out to give His achievements or

243
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,030
I can say, whatever powers He had, to others.

244
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:03,570
He went all over the places, He had no facilities,

245
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,650
but still He went out to many people

246
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,860
and tried to save them.

247
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,980
This was the right-side movement.

248
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:21,690
That means Sahaja Yogis can also become right-sided,but like Christ.

249
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,690
Otherwise if they are right-sided

250
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,860
they’ll organise, they’ll do all kinds of things,

251
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,820
and have problems of the right side.

252
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,980
That’s why I want you to avoid the right side.

253
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,940
But once you are fully a left-sided master of Sahaja Yoga,

254
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,820
then it’s very, very much needed

255
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,570
to be a complete personality of spirituality,

256
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,860
that you should take to right-side movement.

257
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,940
And what is the right-side movement is the collectivity.

258
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,570
Should not be satisfied with what you have got.

259
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,650
It’s very easy

260
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,610
to feel, “Oh, now we have got realisation, now what is there?

261
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:10,070
We are on top of the world!” That’s not so.

262
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,940
You have to go out, talk to people.

263
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,730
They will insult you, they’ll trouble you,

264
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,650
they’ll do all kinds of things.

265
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,570
But you are already a person, already a realised soul.

266
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,190
You can listen to them, what they are saying;

267
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:34,530
you will not ask for anything, but you’d like to do good to them.

268
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,230
This is also a compassion,

269
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,940
that you don’t want to keep your realisation to yourself,

270
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,150
but you want to do it

271
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,980
for others also so that they also get realisation,

272
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:51,730
it’s very important. If you do not feel that way,

273
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,730
the pity for people who haven’t got realisation,

274
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,190
think of the times you were not realised.

275
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,650
These people are also not realised and they are having a bad time,

276
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,110
they can be in for any trouble.

277
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,530
So now, it’s not that if you have got realisation

278
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,190
you settle down with it – no, that’s not the way;

279
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,820
but you should go all out to see

280
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,940
that you give realisation to others, and save them.

281
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:28,860
You all have got realisation not for your sake,

282
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,900
it’s not limited for you, but it is meant for others,

283
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,110
that you have to give it to others.

284
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,730
And as soon as you’ll start giving it to others you’ll be amazed,

285
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:46,570
so many qualities in you will come up;

286
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:54,780
because when you see others, you find

287
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,110
that what is lacking in them,

288
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,980
what do they need, what you have to give,  how you have to give.

289
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,690
You can become anything, you can become a poet,

290
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,110
you can become a writer, you can, anything can you become,

291
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:14,230
in case you face others.

292
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,570
Then it comes as a reaction within you, all these qualities develop,

293
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:26,650
and you become a very good, I should say, artist.

294
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:32,110
This is only possible if you meet other people

295
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:36,030
and talk to them about Sahaja Yoga,

296
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,230
and tell them about your Self-realisation.

297
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,820
I know there will be problems, I know. That is true.

298
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,860
There will be people who will oppose you, say

299
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,530
all kinds of things against you,

300
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,860
and they’ll try to stop your activities and do

301
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,570
all kinds of harm, doesn’t matter.

302
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,780
But that’s the thing you should achieve,

303
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,820
is to meet people, talk to them

304
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,610
and start telling them about Self-realisation you have to save them.

305
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,230
That’s important.

306
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,190
But first of all you should know that you should have no right-sided

307
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,530
complications, otherwise they’ll all run away.

308
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,690
A person who is spiritual is supposed

309
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,230
or accepted to be a very humble person.

310
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:28,030
Of course because he is humble, people will take advantage of him,

311
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,730
say all kinds of things, it’s alright, is a part of the game.

312
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,650
But, he doesn’t mind, he doesn’t mind anything.

313
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,230
Anything that comes his way, he doesn’t mind.

314
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:44,070
But what is the main thing is that he has compassion.

315
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:51,030
His compassion that he had before from the left side is now expanded

316
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,860
and he wants to save the people.

317
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:58,820
People don’t have food, is alright, it’s a big complication;

318
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,610
if people are starving is another;

319
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,900
but if they do not get spirituality,

320
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,150
what’s the use of their human life,

321
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,190
why did they evolve to this state?

322
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,530
They are evolved from animal state,

323
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,780
from the worst possible to a human state.

324
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:24,230
And now if they do not get their realisation,

325
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,030
that means this is worse than starving,

326
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,030
worse than all kinds of poverty,

327
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,780
worse than all kinds of diseases and troubles.

328
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:41,570
So why not try to give them realisation?

329
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:45,820
Why not see that you give them realisation?

330
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,860
But first and foremost thing, as I said,

331
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,900
that in the left you should be very strong.

332
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,940
You shouldn’t start doing it because you have got your realisation,

333
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,900
you can give realisation.

334
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,610
So you should not start doing it

335
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,650
unless and until you have strengthened your left side.

336
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,230
Such a person is extremely humble,

337
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,110
extremely straight, doesn’t grudge about anything,

338
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,730
doesn’t grumble about anything,

339
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,650
and can adjust itself into any circumstance.

340
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,610
It is not attached to anything.

341
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,650
It’s an automatic detachment, it doesn’t have to detach.

342
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:31,730
You may do anything for that person,

343
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,940
you may try to get anything for that person, it’s alright.

344
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,780
That person will accept, no doubt,

345
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,730
but without any attachment to anything.

346
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:48,230
Such a detached person is the one who can work it out,

347
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,690
all kinds of propagation of Sahaja Yoga.

348
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,150
Today that is the greatest need of the world,

349
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,650
that we have to have more Sahaja Yogis.

350
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,190
Now, people are so shy to do that,

351
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,650
it’s very surprising.

352
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,690
But I have seen people who don’t have any truth,

353
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,610
who have all kinds of bad gurus,

354
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:17,900
get after others, try to spread their false ideas.

355
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,530
But Sahaja Yogis, why should they feel,

356
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,570
why should they feel shy, I don’t understand.

357
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,570
So, talk about this to everyone, bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

358
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:34,610
Is a very important day, because as a Guru puja,

359
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,230
they say that a guru cannot give anything to you.

360
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,980
But I can give you the advice,

361
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,610
and the advice that you enlarge your heart,

362
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:56,070
you become humble, and try to spread Sahaja Yoga

363
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,230
with humility, not with aggressiveness.

364
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,940
That is extremely important.

365
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:08,070
If you can do that, then you’ll do full justice

366
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,190
to this life,  which is a spiritual life.

367
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,780
Without that you cannot achieve, you cannot achieve,

368
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,650
the strength of spirituality.

369
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,900
For that you haveto understand that it’s very, very important

370
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:35,730
that you should give Sahaja Yoga a full chance,through your wisdom.

371
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,230
What I receive [is] mostly the letters are

372
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:43,230
that this person is troublesome, that person is troublesome,

373
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,900
that person is doing like that. Forget it!

374
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:52,030
All such persons are not important for Sahaja Yoga.

375
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,650
But if you start on proper lines you will be amazed,

376
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,610
you’ll meet so many people who want peace of mind,

377
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:09,860
peace of heart and a complete oneness with the Divine.

378
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,150
They may not accept, they may not say,

379
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,980
they might have gone to the wrong people also, possibly.

380
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,190
But despite everything,

381
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:26,190
they would like to have a real spiritual peace within themselves.

382
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:31,070
Is a very common desire nowadays among people,

383
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,980
but to approach that and to reach that,

384
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:39,940
you have to take to a life of a very simple personality.

385
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:46,980
You see, if you are so much interested in money,

386
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:53,530
or if you are so much interested in your so-called powers

387
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:00,190
or in your ambitions, then Sahaja Yoga cannot do anything.

388
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,690
But if you are interested in your compassion

389
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:08,190
and understanding about today’s world,

390
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,900
how it is in a turmoil: why?

391
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:16,030
Because of the human beings being in the wrong.

392
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:22,690
What we have to do is to pass them the knowledge of the Divine.

393
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,030
That should be your desire,

394
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:29,940
and that is what you’ll feel very much comfortable with.

395
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:36,530
All other desires, all other wants are,

396
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,650
as you say, it’s very transitory.

397
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:45,030
One desire is to spread Sahaja Yoga,

398
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:49,690
is so beautiful that you go on working on it,

399
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,530
and every time you do that,

400
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,190
you will be so joyous and happy,

401
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,570
you’ll have no problems of any kind.

402
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,980
That’s the sign of greatness of Sahaja Yoga,

403
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,860
and I want you all to become like that.

404
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,980
As today’s day is great, because

405
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:16,030
we are thinking of all the great saints who came on this earth

406
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,070
and who tried to lead us.  What they did,

407
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:23,230
all of them tried to spread the truth all over the world.

408
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:28,650
They suffered a lot, they had problems, so many problems,

409
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:35,690
but they worked very hard in every way to spread Sahaja Yoga

410
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,030
and talk about God anddivinity.

411
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,190
All that is what today you have to give Me,

412
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:48,230
a promise, that whenever you get any other human being,

413
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,860
you can tell them about Sahaja Yoga.

414
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:58,940
Not that it’s important but it’s absolutely

415
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,940
immediate need of the world.

416
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:05,030
If you understand this point,

417
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:09,190
that at this time, why are you in this world

418
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,980
and what is the need of the world,

419
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,820
you will immediately start feeling the responsibility.

420
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:19,690
Whether you are a man or a woman is not important.

421
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:24,110
Go all out to preach, think,

422
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,690
make people understand about Sahaja  Yoga

423
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,110
in every way that is possible,

424
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,230
and I think, then, you will become complete as gurus.

425
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,780
If Sahaja Yoga is just with you, you cannot be a guru.

426
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,570
‘Guru’ also doesn’t mean that you go on preaching about Sahaja Yoga

427
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,150
talking about Sahaja Yoga, giving lectures about Sahaja Yoga, no!

428
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:52,190
It means the one who gives realisations to others.

429
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:59,650
How many people you give realisation is the thing,

430
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,190
not to be counted,  but to be felt within like the ripples,

431
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:09,230
waves of the Ocean of Love in your heart.

432
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:15,190
So beautiful it is to see that people get realisation

433
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,860
and are immersed in the joy of spirituality.

434
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:26,110
That’s what I want you to do. That’s why I am on this earth.

435
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,820
I had to suffer also quite a lot, doesn’t matter:

436
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,070
so-called sufferings, I was watching it just like a drama.

437
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,230
So it’s ok.

438
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,690
As long as you do not pay much attention

439
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,150
to all these sufferings, what is so great?

440
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:48,570
Now you have seen yesterday a beautiful drama about Mohammad Sahib.

441
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:54,070
I always used to think,  and it was such pain, about Him,  that

442
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,110
how people have misunderstood and have gone astray:

443
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,650
why they are doing all wrong things? Now,

444
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:06,900
I feel happy that at least you people have realised His greatness,

445
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:10,940
and have understood and made such a beautiful drama out of it.

446
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,230
I don’t know how far we can propagate this,

447
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,940
but it’s a fact that Mohammad Sahib Himself

448
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:29,980
was finished, then also His daughter, grand-children were finished,

449
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,610
His son-in-law was finished.

450
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,820
And after that, by finishing them,

451
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,900
they started another horrible thing called Sunnis.

452
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,650
Now, the Sunnah religion is not near the truth at all,

453
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:52,730
it’s some sort of a very aggressive and a very cruel religion,

454
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,690
and that started spreading everywhere.

455
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:02,900
In the real Islam religion of Mohammed Sahib was not there.

456
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:08,030
Those people who killed Him started becoming ‘Islamic’.

457
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,150
So this is also a very wrong thing,

458
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:20,070
that a man who was so great and so much of spirituality

459
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,150
was not just accepted,

460
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,980
and somebody who killed Him is now accepted.

461
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,940
It can happen in anything.

462
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,190
But the worst it has happened in is Islamic world,

463
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:38,030
which is very dangerous, and that’s we see

464
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,690
that, in the name of God, how many bad things they are doing.

465
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,190
So, try to understand

466
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:54,230
that it is not the fate of Mohammad Sahib it has happened,

467
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,190
it’s not the fate of reality it has happened,

468
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,150
but it’s an eye-opener for all of us to see

469
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:09,860
that the Truth is always challenged by untruth.

470
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,030
And we should stand by the Truth, whatever may happen.

471
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,650
And a day will come when people will realise

472
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,570
that this was a wrong thing they were being,

473
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,940
all the time been following,

474
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:28,150
and have been doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

475
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,650
All this will work out I am sure, very soon,

476
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:39,820
if My desire is that powerful, I’m sure

477
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:45,190
that they will realise that to be kind to be nice to be compassionate

478
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:51,610
is the best way to feel happy, nothing more than that.

479
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:55,570
May God bless you.
