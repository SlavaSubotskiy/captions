1
00:00:03,696 --> 00:00:09,154
This was least expected that we'll have a Puja here or

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,726
we'll have any program of this kind.

3
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:19,594
But I think something was left out of the whole

4
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:26,106
program of such a fast one as you know

5
00:00:26,503 --> 00:00:31,232
I had to do, going from London to Frankfurt

6
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:34,741
to America to Bogota, to be back, then Andorra

7
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:39,093
and all these places still, I thought, now
it is finished.

8
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:42,674
And I came here in London I learned that

9
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,587
 there was one Puja was not done it is left Vishuddhi,

10
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,328
and that coincides with this Raksha Bandhan

11
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:58,519
because it is the sister relationship and brother relationship.

12
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:09,646
So in the history, if you go, Shri Krishna was born

13
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,353
 the day his sister was born,

14
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:22,884
and this Vishnumaya was transferred from, transformed

15
00:01:23,179 --> 00:01:27,305
I should say, into a lightning later on,

16
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:31,466
but She was the one who announced

17
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:37,946
 the existence of Shri Krishna at that time -

18
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:42,260
that He is born and He is living, He is in the present.

19
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:47,072
This is the job of the left Vishuddhi, of the lightning,

20
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:52,782
 and you have seen that whenever
I am going to any place, or

21
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:56,550
 I will be giving a program or something, just before that,

22
00:01:56,629 --> 00:02:01,221
the lightning, the thunder, all this appears in the sky, you see,

23
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:04,545
to show that announcement.

24
00:02:04,813 --> 00:02:09,316
So it is one of the things that is used for
announcement.

25
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:15,675
To make it more practical and understanding is

26
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:21,250
 that we use electricity now for our televisions,

27
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:25,916
for our announcements, for telling people about messages

28
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,433
of something of great importance.

29
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,632
I don't know if they do it, might not be.

30
00:02:32,198 --> 00:02:36,906
In the same way we should use our left Vishuddhi
for the announcement

31
00:02:37,097 --> 00:02:39,532
of the coming of Adi Shakti.

32
00:02:39,755 --> 00:02:44,224
But on the contrary, people start using it as a pocket

33
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:48,722
kept for our extra ego to be filled.

34
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:55,441
When we feel guilty, firstly we feel guilty when

35
00:02:55,537 --> 00:02:59,817
 our sense of relationships are not all right.

36
00:03:01,197 --> 00:03:08,309
For example, we do not understand a sister

37
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:15,089
and a brother, the relationship, which is very pure,

38
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:20,732
and is above all kinds of contamination.

39
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:27,667
But as you know in the West,

40
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:33,670
because maybe of drinking and doing all kinds of things

41
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:37,747
which are against awareness, people have lost the value system,

42
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:40,293
and in that they have also lost

43
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,376
the system to understand what is a sister
and what is a brother.

44
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:51,484
So Vishnumaya is so important - extremely important -

45
00:03:51,706 --> 00:04:01,894
 because of Her, announcement of an incarnation takes place.

46
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,388
It's, you can say, in the cosmos that is the
television that announces.

47
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:11,092
It works it out.

48
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,717
But in our own being Vishnumaya it resides in the left Vishuddhi,

49
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:23,547
 and I find that Vishnumaya is the thing that suffers
the most, especially in the West,

50
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:26,898
because it's a fashion to feel guilty about everything.

51
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:35,387
Normally, say when Vishnumaya Herself announced

52
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:40,898
that Shri Krishna is born and He is existing on this Earth,

53
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:45,760
if you see from a practical point of view might think
it's a wrong thing She has done,

54
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,951
 because to tell Kamsa that He exists and He resides,

55
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:55,318
is still existing, is giving Him a danger

56
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:59,599
and one would have
felt guilty later on - "Oh, why did I do it?"

57
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:03,300
If I had not told, he would not have known."

58
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:07,796
But that's the right thing to be done, that's
the job they have to do.

59
00:05:09,903 --> 00:05:13,732
So we have to see for ourselves that

60
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,803
what makes us guilty for small, small things

61
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,415
is actually is our own ego reacting against us and

62
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,724
wants us to reconcile with what mistakes we have committed.

63
00:05:27,322 --> 00:05:30,861
Like some people feel guilty because

64
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:35,629
 they have said something they should not have said,

65
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:44,266
or maybe because they have done something
which they should not have done normally.

66
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:51,656
May not be on a Sahaja Yoga basis, maybe something
else also, very frivolous.

67
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:55,873
Like somebody spills - say - coffee.

68
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,423
They feel guilty.

69
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,448
Or somebody puts the knife on the other side,

70
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:04,250
on the left hand side, then they'll feel guilty.

71
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:07,340
I mean such stupid things like that which are

72
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:11,120
regarded as norms in the society and people start thinking

73
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:17,515
that these norms are very, very important -
as if they are something like a dharma

74
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,505
and you must maintain those
norms.

75
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,637
But these norms are man-made, most of them
are man-made.

76
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:31,089
You see some of them are so stupid and so horrifying

77
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:35,086
 that I think, in England I feel,
there are some, which must be really

78
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:38,945
 completely squashed and finished - like shaking hands.

79
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,226
It's a very bad thing, I think, is to do,
is to shake hands with everyone,

80
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:46,352
because God knows what kinds of hands people are having,

81
00:06:46,377 --> 00:06:48,764
 what kinds of vibrations they have.

82
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:53,643
Now, when My husband has his reception
sometimes I have to shake hands

83
00:06:53,668 --> 00:07:02,067
with seven hundred people coming in,
and then seven hundred drunkards going out.

84
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,258
So, this shaking of hands, I think is a very,
very bad habit.

85
00:07:10,283 --> 00:07:12,974
It's all right for Sahaja Yogis to shake hands,

86
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:16,771
 but for others to shake anybody's hand, is better to do Namaste,

87
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:20,418
 though it might be some a very simple Indian method,

88
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:23,057
but I think is the best way is to say, "Namaste",

89
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:29,139
because shaking hands can cause
 lots of problems to human beings,

90
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:33,272
and now with all these diseases coming up and all that,

91
00:07:33,297 --> 00:07:36,338
I think one has to be very careful about shaking hands.

92
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:40,479
Worse than that is in France I find is like

93
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:43,169
when you meet someone you must kiss, you see

94
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:45,739
- is the worst habit I tell you, horrible.

95
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:49,616
But they do kiss you all the time if you go there,

96
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,824
 I had very bad shocks to begin with, you see

97
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,327
anybody would just get you, kiss you here,

98
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:58,996
 kiss you there, you start looking at the person.

99
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:04,514
Now with the fear of AIDS and all that perhaps
they might stop all that nonsense.

100
00:08:04,812 --> 00:08:06,925
But there is no need to do all,

101
00:08:06,941 --> 00:08:08,794
this is not a very good way of wishing anyone,

102
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,628
 doesn't show any respect, in both the cases.

103
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,506
When you shake hands also there's no respect

104
00:08:14,531 --> 00:08:17,442
and even when you kiss somebody there is no respect.

105
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:19,974
But if you say "Namaste" means "I bow to you",

106
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:24,977
Namaste is "I bow to you", is respect,

107
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:29,029
and this is one thing we have to do is to respect each other.

108
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,430
But when we are not then we feel guilty,

109
00:08:32,526 --> 00:08:36,303
and like that, you see these all like "Thank you".

110
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:38,431
If you have not said, "thank you" to somebody

111
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:40,744
then we think we have done a big mistake.

112
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,538
I mean the amount of thank-you's we do, you know.

113
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:46,312
We get so much used to it,

114
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:52,185
that even if you see a statue you say 
"Thank you very much for your darshan."

115
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:55,368
It goes on like that, you see, it's a bit too much.

116
00:08:55,393 --> 00:08:58,807
Too much "Thank you" becomes a lip service - or "sorry".

117
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:03,841
Nowadays, in our times we used to say, "I
beg your pardon" on the phone, but now people

118
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:07,468
say, "Sorry, sorry, sorry" I mean sorry for
what?!

119
00:09:07,468 --> 00:09:11,637
Just can't, that "sorry" goes into left Vishuddhi.

120
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:16,579
If you don't hear it's none of your faults,
maybe the fault of the telephone, maybe the

121
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:19,179
fault of the other person.

122
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:23,709
So, without understanding what is there to
be sorry, just go on saying "Sorry, sorry,

123
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:29,699
sorry", feeling sorry for something, is absolutely
boring and such a person can become extremely

124
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:36,278
boring, since morning till evening he is saying
"I'm sorry for this, I'm sorry for that, I'm

125
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:41,119
sorry for this", and all the time feeling
sorry for everything, you feel sorry for that

126
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,239
person.

127
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:50,981
So one has to be in a joyful mood, and doesn't
matter if somebody doesn't say "Sorry", doesn't

128
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:52,006
matter.

129
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:57,019
But some people can take a very big objection
if you don't say "Thank you" to them.

130
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:02,049
Very funny thing is that I have experienced
in England once.

131
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:07,799
I was going out - John was there, John was
driving the car, and My daughter was coming

132
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:13,919
out of the house so he left the door open
and he just, as soon as she sat down, hardly

133
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,139
took about five, six seconds, he closed the
door, went round.

134
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:23,399
But he didn't say "Thank you" to the fellow
who was standing behind, you see they are

135
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,528
supposed to be all very rich, cultured, educated
people.

136
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:29,889
So this fellow got out of his car, caught
hold of this belt, and he wouldn't allow the

137
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:32,838
car to move and the car was moving.

138
00:10:32,838 --> 00:10:34,829
I couldn't understand what was happening.

139
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:37,099
So I asked John, "Stop the car, stop the car."

140
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:38,099
I said, "What's the matter?"

141
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:39,289
"She didn't say 'Thank you' to me."

142
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:42,599
This fellow would have been killed or something
would have happened to him, doesn't matter,

143
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,819
you should say "Thank you".

144
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:50,419
These are the funny norms that we have, so
many of them and sometimes we miss the point,

145
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:54,466
sometimes we miss the point because the whole
thing becomes so mechanical.

146
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:56,819
It is not mechanical if you say "Thank you".

147
00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:04,103
It's a way of just, even expression or smile
or just a gesture can say that you are thankful

148
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:07,218
to people for what they have done.

149
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:11,779
But it is a norm, which is created since long,
you know.

150
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:16,544
They have dropped out so many things, like
they have dropped out their tailcoats, everything,

151
00:11:16,544 --> 00:11:20,364
and I think too much thanking and too much
feeling sorry should be dropped out.

152
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:23,895
Either you go to the left or to the right.

153
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:28,744
So the best thing now is if somebody does
something for you, all right just a smile,

154
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:35,144
sometimes say "Thank you" all right, but not
all the time, did you say Thank you?

155
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,914
Like one child told me "I don't want to go
to their house", I said, "Why?"

156
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:42,394
"Because I have to say 'thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you' all the time."

157
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:49,214
So children also somehow or another find it's
very artificial, becomes a lip service, and

158
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:54,404
this lip service can go anywhere and people
start feeling very sorry for things like - I

159
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:56,744
didn't send a Christmas card, so they feel
sorry.

160
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:58,504
Christmas card is not important.

161
00:11:58,504 --> 00:12:01,904
We must see why we have to send a Christmas
card.

162
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:03,214
Is to wish this person.

163
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:05,953
Do you have that in your heart?

164
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:09,104
Did you feel that from your heart?

165
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:14,914
Once you start feeling from your heart then
you will never catch your left Vishuddhi.

166
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:19,294
It's a very superficial way of avoiding the
mistakes you have committed.

167
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:24,654
Now supposing I have not done something which
I should have done, sometimes it happens,

168
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:30,013
then I feel it in My heart you know, just
feel it.

169
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:31,013
Should have done it.

170
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:33,633
If I have not done it then it gets corrected.

171
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:37,454
Not only that but for a Sahaja Yogi it works.

172
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:41,974
So to feel it in your heart otherwise whatever
is superficial you shouldn't worry.

173
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:48,254
You shouldn't worry, you are all Yogis, you
must know you are all saints now, so you don't

174
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:50,134
have to worry about small, small things.

175
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:55,263
Even if you slap someone is all right, if
it is necessary you can slap people.

176
00:12:55,263 --> 00:13:00,897
There were yogis used to throw stones at others
just to save themselves from their boredom,

177
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:02,778
from their aggression.

178
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:07,437
So it's all right, you are all saints, so
saints can do that way.

179
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:12,290
I read a very nice story about a king who
was a monk, you see and he had to be a king.

180
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:15,981
He didn't want to become a king because he
said, "I am a saintly person.

181
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:17,653
I don't want."

182
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:23,087
He was a saint, but he was made, he was forced,
to become because there was no one, everybody

183
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:26,432
was very happy, and he gave all permission
to do whatever they like.

184
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:31,562
But the grandees of that place you see, all
the people who were holding the courts, and

185
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:36,702
all that, became very powerful because he
was a very mild person and very kindly person,

186
00:13:36,702 --> 00:13:41,912
and they just exploited all the villagers,
and they exploited all the poor people, and

187
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:47,222
all the farmers, and everybody took away all
their things and they looted them, tortured

188
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:53,794
them, and troubled their women, and did all
kinds of monstrous things to his subjects.

189
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,379
But then he was told about it.

190
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:03,600
Then he thought that now I am sitting as a
king here and though I am a saint and as a

191
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,767
saint I have a duty to perform.

192
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:14,297
So he made a very nice plot you see, got very
good people, handful of people who were very,

193
00:14:14,297 --> 00:14:22,497
very close to him, and on whom he can depend,
and he called all these grandees for a court

194
00:14:22,497 --> 00:14:30,467
and tell them not to bring any weapons on
them and then cut everybody's neck there - everybody's.

195
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:38,907
He was a saint, though he cut everybody's
neck, because these people were horrid.

196
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:42,301
To punish them was his job, and he did it
without feeling guilty, without catching on

197
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:44,257
the left Vishuddhi.

198
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:50,705
So whatever has to be done has to be done,
there's nothing to be sorry about it.

199
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:58,528
You don't have to be sorry at all, but, whatever
you feel then if it is not expressed, that

200
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:04,101
feeling properly, then you have to feel it
in your heart so that it acts and works - this

201
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:06,688
is, of course, for left Vishuddhi.

202
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:11,162
But one thing we have to ask ourselves, "How
do we get rid of our left Vishuddhi?"

203
00:15:11,187 --> 00:15:16,727
And when you start asking this question, "Why
have I got left Vishuddhi?"

204
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:19,618
It is the surplus of your ego as I have told
you.

205
00:15:19,643 --> 00:15:27,213
So try to watch what you have done, try to
see what you have said, why did you do it?

206
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:33,436
And then face it, and next time don't do it,
so you won't have the guilt because guilt

207
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:39,507
is nothing but a stored up mistakes and, like
going to a priest and saying, "I'm sorry I

208
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:42,186
did this, I did that" and again doing the
same thing.

209
00:15:42,186 --> 00:16:04,407
It amounts to the same because then you don't
correct yourself.

210
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:29,793
So this
amounts to one thing, to understand what mistakes

211
00:16:29,825 --> 00:16:37,284
you have committed, what your ego wants to
feel bad about it, and then do not store it

212
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:39,965
up, face it up and never do it again.

213
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:44,475
Just we determine "I'll not do it again,"
that's all.

214
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,889
You have to just say, "I will not do it again"
- whatever it is.

215
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:50,906
Face up to it and say that I will not do it
again.

216
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:55,058
That's the best way you can manage your left
Vishuddhi.

217
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,253
Another thing is the announcement.

218
00:16:57,253 --> 00:17:01,652
If you use your left Vishuddhi for announcement
there cannot be any guilt.

219
00:17:01,652 --> 00:17:06,463
Without feeling any guilt, without feeling
nervous, without feeling funny about it, you

220
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:08,253
have to go on telling about it.

221
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:09,253
It works!

222
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:10,253
It works very well.

223
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:15,254
We need not be now anymore afraid, now I've
been in this country fourteen years, working

224
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,177
in the West for fourteen years, you can talk
about it very freely.

225
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:22,692
Today only they gave Me an example of that.

226
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:30,831
That the musicians were coming, and while
coming, one of them happened to go earlier

227
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:33,831
and they asked him, "Why are you going to
London?"

228
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:37,181
He said, "We are going to sing devotional
songs to Shri Mataji."

229
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:38,466
"Who is Shri Mataji?"

230
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,738
He showed My photograph.

231
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:40,763
Finished.

232
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,933
He never asked them for anything, didn't ask
for their passport, didn't check them or anything.

233
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:54,382
Another thing was when they came and the customs
people were there and they asked, "Where are

234
00:17:54,382 --> 00:17:56,472
you singing, where are you fixed?"

235
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:58,752
They said, "We are not fixed anywhere.

236
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:06,202
We are just going to sing our musical songs,
our musical devotion for Mother, and we are

237
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:09,934
going to sing songs to Her, to Mataji Nirmala
Devi.

238
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:12,272
The fellow was an Englishman.

239
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:16,421
In Hindi he said, "Thik He.

240
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:17,626
Thik He."

241
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:21,188
So these things announcement helps a lot.

242
00:18:21,681 --> 00:18:30,752
For example, wearing a badge, or wearing a,
what you call, a necklace like that, or a

243
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:34,451
ring, itself is an announcement that you have
found out the Truth.

244
00:18:34,476 --> 00:18:40,662
And then, not only that, but also if you want
you should sometimes start wearing a saree,

245
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:46,822
doesn't matter, sometimes kurta pyjama, doesn't
matter, on the streets, if you walk about,

246
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:47,822
people will know.

247
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:51,212
Now some say that if you wear these things
then Mother has said, "No."

248
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:53,032
I never said so, that you cannot wear.

249
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,032
If you like you can wear.

250
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,032
But there's a freedom to you.

251
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:58,242
If you want you can wear it, or if you don't
want, need not wear.

252
00:18:58,242 --> 00:19:03,082
But the trouble is, sometimes like these Hari
Rama, Hari Krishna women, then they used to

253
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:04,892
wear these dresses and go about.

254
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:08,932
But they were dirty, filthy, unwashed women.

255
00:19:08,932 --> 00:19:12,696
In a proper, traditional way, if you wear
sarees, people will appreciate, definitely.

256
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:13,721
Why not?

257
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:16,051
They would like to see you in sarees.

258
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:17,362
If you want you can wear it.

259
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:19,522
Will be a good idea for you to go about.

260
00:19:19,522 --> 00:19:21,791
There's no harm in wearing sarees.

261
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:28,462
I think it's very decent dress, and makes
a woman look like a woman much more than pants,

262
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:30,402
and those jeans and things like that.

263
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,702
So it doesn't matter.

264
00:19:31,702 --> 00:19:33,982
But then don't feel guilty with it.

265
00:19:33,982 --> 00:19:38,582
If you want to wear it, wear it with daring
and with courage.

266
00:19:38,582 --> 00:19:41,482
Be a brave person.

267
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:46,362
So only the brave people can get rid of their
left Vishuddhi.

268
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:48,572
Because you are brave you are doing it.

269
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:50,082
That's the culture that has to come.

270
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:53,822
We like the sarees, we'll wear, we like the
kurta pyjamas.

271
00:19:53,822 --> 00:19:56,702
Now in this heat, to wear a three-piece suit.

272
00:19:56,702 --> 00:19:57,801
Is it good?

273
00:19:57,801 --> 00:20:03,642
But you'll wear three-piece suit with a tie,
perspiring, in India especially, I don't understand

274
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:07,042
how the English can manage with the dress
of England.

275
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:10,322
Wearing three-piece suits and with the ties.

276
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:13,102
All right, some people can, but not all.

277
00:20:13,102 --> 00:20:17,911
Those who feel very cold can manage, but not
everybody, cannot do it.

278
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:22,182
So why should you wear these dresses which
are not suitable for you?

279
00:20:22,182 --> 00:20:27,572
But that doesn't mean, in India I've seen
people wearing some sort of a, so-called short

280
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:33,282
and a so-called short on top, and moving about,
that's stupid because it is indecent.

281
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,811
So we cannot wear indecent dresses.

282
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:39,852
We have to wear decent dresses but which are
comfortable and decent.

283
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:47,102
There is nothing like, we are English, we
are Indian, we are this - we are all universal

284
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:48,102
beings.

285
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:53,041
And once we accept this, suddenly you jump
into the state of collective consciousness,

286
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,832
into the state of Virata.

287
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:59,372
Once Virata opens out left Vishuddi's finished.

288
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:04,152
If you are a part and parcel of the Virata,
how can you make mistakes?

289
00:21:04,152 --> 00:21:06,042
How can you be guilty?

290
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:08,852
Because it is the Virata who takes over.

291
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,402
He's the One.

292
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,516
Supposing now in your hand something goes
wrong.

293
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:15,877
You don't blame your hand for it.

294
00:21:15,902 --> 00:21:18,363
What you blame is the body.

295
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:20,902
The body has the problem and the body has
to look after.

296
00:21:20,902 --> 00:21:22,702
The body takes over.

297
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:26,112
It comes, repairs, looks after, circulates.

298
00:21:26,112 --> 00:21:30,558
Whatever it is, pains or whatever it is, the
suggestion comes from the whole body.

299
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:34,839
It's not that the only finger starts feeling
guilty - the whole body.

300
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:41,260
In the same way, once you jump into that state
of Virata, into the state where you feel I

301
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,169
am a part and parcel of the whole, Vishuddhi
should drop out.

302
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:47,480
Left Vishuddi should completely drop out.

303
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,020
It has no place.

304
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,560
It has no place.

305
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,990
How can you alone feel guilty when you are
part and parcel of the whole?

306
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,310
What's the logic?

307
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,920
You cannot feel guilty.

308
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:07,060
If you are part and parcel of the whole then
the whole takes over, and this is where you

309
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,880
can cut down your left Vishuddhi very well.

310
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,830
So now we have to come to point where you
have to see what is our destiny.

311
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,570
Sahaja Yogis have their destinies.

312
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,640
Have you fulfilled your destiny?

313
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,640
You have not come to Sahaja Yoga out of some
sort of a fashion.

314
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:29,150
You have not come to Sahaja Yoga out of some
sort of a fan of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

315
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,150
No!

316
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:37,705
You have come here to be saints, all right,
and then what is your destiny?

317
00:22:40,403 --> 00:22:47,620
Destiny is to become part and parcel of the
whole.

318
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,110
Have you become part and parcel of the whole?

319
00:22:52,135 --> 00:22:55,069
The collectivity part of it.

320
00:22:55,379 --> 00:23:00,566
You still are involved, supposing, into your
own problems - "I should have said this to

321
00:23:00,591 --> 00:23:05,219
my wife, to my children, to my house," then
you are not part and parcel of the whole.

322
00:23:05,838 --> 00:23:09,699
But if you just think of other people who
are Sahaja Yogis - how nice they are, they

323
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:17,823
are all my brothers and sisters, we belong
to one family, we have to be together, it's

324
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:27,956
all one - then what happens, the whole petty
ideas of feeling guilty and all that, disappears

325
00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:29,004
into thin air.

326
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:35,501
It's like one drop of something getting into
the ocean.

327
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:38,141
God knows where it has gone.

328
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:42,459
It has become such a small speck of a stuff
that you don't even see, don't even feel it,

329
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,300
what it is.

330
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:54,729
So what one has to understand is that we have
to fulfil our destiny and what is our destiny?

331
00:23:54,966 --> 00:24:04,158
Our destiny is to become part and parcel of
the whole and that's how Vishnumaya asserts

332
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:06,311
Herself, shines and announces.

333
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,849
When you have become part and parcel of the
whole, what is there to feel shy to tell about

334
00:24:09,874 --> 00:24:10,619
it?

335
00:24:10,644 --> 00:24:12,166
We are saints.

336
00:24:12,191 --> 00:24:13,271
Of course we are.

337
00:24:13,296 --> 00:24:14,456
"Are you saints??"

338
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:15,641
"Yes, we are."

339
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:21,384
You have to talk about Sahaja Yoga, you have
to talk about Me, in a very open manner, not

340
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,933
to feel shy about it.

341
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:27,690
We have had a sort of processions and all
that in India.

342
00:24:27,715 --> 00:24:31,771
But here we dare not have any procession.

343
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:36,836
In England, out of question, you see, I don't
know, people feel very shy about it, to have

344
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:38,122
a procession.

345
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:41,438
But supposing you have a procession then what
happens?

346
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:46,179
Then you are just on the television as soon
as you have a procession.

347
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:51,891
To bring yourself on the procession you have
to announce and make it a collective effort

348
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:53,834
to announce, then you are.

349
00:24:53,859 --> 00:25:00,021
But I would say we have to wait for one or
two years more, at the most one year more,

350
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:04,672
and then we have to go ahead with demonstrations,
with telling people, announcing it, talking

351
00:25:04,697 --> 00:25:05,697
about it.

352
00:25:05,783 --> 00:25:11,271
This is what is Vishnumaya and if you start
thinking tonight that what you are going to

353
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:15,203
do about it your left Vishuddhi will be cleared
out.

354
00:25:15,228 --> 00:25:22,221
So much so that I have become deaf on My left
ear, the way you people are sometimes feel

355
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:23,801
guilty about everything.

356
00:25:23,801 --> 00:25:28,041
Now don't feel guilty that we have not fulfilled
our destiny.

357
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:30,401
That's the trouble.

358
00:25:30,401 --> 00:25:32,971
Think of it positively.

359
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:37,661
You see when you feel guilty you don't think
about it positively - "What I should have

360
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:43,121
done, what I should have looked after, how
I should have gone about it, how I should

361
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:45,451
have gone further."

362
00:25:45,476 --> 00:25:51,661
So these things are very important to understand
that if you have to fulfil your destiny, first

363
00:25:51,661 --> 00:25:57,041
and foremost thing is you must think about
it and understand about it, that what is your

364
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:58,041
destiny?

365
00:25:58,699 --> 00:26:01,389
What have you to become?

366
00:26:01,532 --> 00:26:06,281
Because now you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
got powers, even if you are caught up, whatever

367
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:10,820
may be wrong, you can give realization to
others, you can do lots of marvels, you can

368
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:16,632
show lots of credible things that are never
done, people can see for yourself that they

369
00:26:16,632 --> 00:26:23,771
are, themselves that they are, they see that
yourself is something magical box that it

370
00:26:23,771 --> 00:26:26,015
can create so many things - it's true.

371
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,180
But, that is not your destiny.

372
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,310
The destiny is to become part and parcel of
the whole.

373
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:38,861
That's your destiny and to be effective much
more as a part and parcel of the whole, for

374
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:42,521
that, first thing you should start is an announcement.

375
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:47,791
I was sorry to hear that when they wanted
to have a program and all that to be done,

376
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:52,300
only a few people were there putting the posters.

377
00:26:52,300 --> 00:27:01,741
There should be some method in England, specially
England is a place where people are very sort

378
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:05,891
of ... because it's an island, you see, they
also have their islands of their own.

379
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:08,200
Everybody has an island, I find, here.

380
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,881
And they live in an island of their own - "my
family, my house, my, my, my books, my this,

381
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:17,430
my, my, my, my that, my that."

382
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,221
So they live in an island.

383
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:24,591
Now if you tell them that we are having this
program - "Oh, I have no time, and I'm sorry,

384
00:27:24,591 --> 00:27:27,761
I'm very busy" - or something like that.

385
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:28,981
Then they feel guilty.

386
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,781
"Oh I should have gone, you know, after all,
this and this."

387
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:45,161
Now you have joined a movement, a kind of
a Divine upsurge, which has to work out emancipation

388
00:27:45,161 --> 00:27:46,871
of the whole of humanity.

389
00:27:46,871 --> 00:27:54,550
Now you cannot have such a mediocre effort
and because of that you suffer every way.

390
00:27:54,550 --> 00:28:02,995
All those countries where people have taken
a very great step forward have achieved every

391
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,020
way.

392
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:07,141
They have got money, they have got everything
with them.

393
00:28:07,141 --> 00:28:14,810
But still if you are worried about this and
worried about that then what happens that

394
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:20,930
your progress is stopped, in a way, deterred.

395
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,631
So I would request you not to worry about
anything.

396
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:28,596
Just think, "I have to become part and parcel
of the whole."

397
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:34,531
That's why last time I requested all the women
to give up this idea of possessing the husband,

398
00:28:34,531 --> 00:28:36,981
possessing the children, possessing this,
possessing that.

399
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,548
They don't have to possess anyone.

400
00:28:39,573 --> 00:28:44,571
What they have to do is to see that they do
not get possessed with such funny ideas, and

401
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:48,351
do not try to destroy the collectivity.

402
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:56,667
So the collectivity has to be brought in,
in such a way, that people do feel the oneness

403
00:28:56,692 --> 00:29:02,950
within themselves, and feel that they are
all together, living together, as part and

404
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:04,923
parcel of the whole.

405
00:29:04,948 --> 00:29:10,652
For example, now this finger does some mistake,
I mean this finger gets hurt or something,

406
00:29:10,677 --> 00:29:15,471
this finger doesn't go and say, "I'm sorry",
does it?

407
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:22,721
Or say by mistake, you see, this hand hits
this one, it won't say, "I'm sorry I hit you."

408
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:26,831
Because who is the other to say the sorry?

409
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:30,449
Who is the other for whom to feel guilty?

410
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:32,411
We are all one.

411
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,734
So what is there to say sorry?

412
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,719
There is no foreigner within us.

413
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:44,433
We are all together and this is how one has
to realize that there is nothing to feel sorry

414
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:45,458
or anything.

415
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:51,903
I never send any cards to anyone, to be very
frank, cards or flowers, to be very frank,

416
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:57,493
because I have no guru and I have no Mataji
to send flowers to.

417
00:29:57,493 --> 00:30:01,353
If I had somebody I would have sent but I
have no one, to whom should I send?

418
00:30:01,353 --> 00:30:04,773
Now they are all Mine, so why should I send
it to them?

419
00:30:04,773 --> 00:30:07,192
They are part and parcel of My being.

420
00:30:07,192 --> 00:30:09,933
So why should I send this to them?

421
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,383
But I can nourish them.

422
00:30:12,383 --> 00:30:17,582
I give them presents because they are part
and parcel of My being.

423
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:22,873
So I just give them presents because, you
see, like the heart will nourish some parts

424
00:30:22,873 --> 00:30:27,773
of the body, the head will nourish some parts
of the body or will do some function of nourishment.

425
00:30:27,773 --> 00:30:32,113
In the same way one can do it, is to give
presents to each other.

426
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:33,113
Think about it.

427
00:30:33,113 --> 00:30:37,192
Small, small, things I have told you to think
about how to do it.

428
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:38,493
It is sometimes so.

429
00:30:38,493 --> 00:30:48,273
Like once I was singing one song in Marathi
and it was left there, for some time, I didn't

430
00:30:48,273 --> 00:30:53,973
know how they picked it up from somewhere,
and one day I was just sitting like this and

431
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:55,883
they started the song.

432
00:30:55,883 --> 00:31:01,533
Tears started rolling My eyes, I said, "Look
at that, how thoughtful of them to know about

433
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:03,903
that I like this song."

434
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:09,733
But when you are not part and parcel of the
whole you can make a tremendous mistakes in

435
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:12,302
also pleasing other people.

436
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:14,337
The example of that is like this.

437
00:31:14,337 --> 00:31:18,247
I've been to Sahasrara Puja.

438
00:31:18,247 --> 00:31:23,423
At the Sahasrara Puja there was a lady in
charge of Me and she was little, I must say,

439
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:28,787
I don't know what is to say, but for two and
a half days she gave Me nothing to eat but

440
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:29,946
mozzarella cheese.

441
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:34,027
Morning, mozzarella cheese, daytime mozzarella,
evening mozzarella.

442
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:39,356
I said, "Must be they are turning short of
money that's why there's no food in the place."

443
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:42,659
So I never said anything, I was just eating
nicely, I am not bothered.

444
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:46,027
Then somebody came and told Me, "Oh what a
choice we have here."

445
00:31:46,027 --> 00:31:47,027
"Eh, you have a choice?"

446
00:31:47,027 --> 00:31:48,917
"Yes, lots of things what's eating."

447
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:51,926
I said, "Oh God, I've been eating only mozzarella."

448
00:31:51,965 --> 00:31:55,927
So they said that, "No these, they told me
that you like mozzarella."

449
00:31:55,927 --> 00:32:06,927
I said, "All right I like mozzarella - doesn't
mean that I don't eat anything else."

450
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:10,506
So this kind of understanding shows what?

451
00:32:10,506 --> 00:32:15,957
Shows that you have not understood Me at all.

452
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:18,807
You have not seen Me.

453
00:32:18,807 --> 00:32:24,337
Partially you know that once I liked, I said
all right I like mozzarella, so only mozzarella,

454
00:32:24,337 --> 00:32:26,055
mozzarella, mozzarella.

455
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,277
But what I would say that, you see, that,
to understand Me you must know that, to study

456
00:32:32,277 --> 00:32:37,427
Me, to understand Me, what Mother is, what
She likes, what She doesn't, if you really

457
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:43,767
want, I mean I like practically everything,
I eat every, I have no choice of food or anything,

458
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:44,767
no choice of anything.

459
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:50,707
I like English music, Western music, I like
even some pop music, I like every sort of

460
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:54,626
thing, I mean, whichever is good, which has
good vibrations, I like everything.

461
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:56,986
I don't make fuss about things.

462
00:32:56,986 --> 00:33:04,067
But to say that Mother likes this, you see,
and they just stick onto that point, shows

463
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,616
that they are not collective.

464
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,787
Collective is to understand Me fully.

465
00:33:07,787 --> 00:33:14,376
Supposing there is a problem here so all the
blood cells know there is a problem here.

466
00:33:14,376 --> 00:33:15,647
They all know about it.

467
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:17,637
They know about the whole body.

468
00:33:17,637 --> 00:33:20,006
They just don't know about that particular
cell.

469
00:33:20,006 --> 00:33:26,157
In the same way, if you know just particularly
about Me this aspect, that aspect, that aspect,

470
00:33:26,157 --> 00:33:28,876
then I will be starving Myself, I think.

471
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:35,537
So to try to understand in all aspects and
for that I think the best way is to know the

472
00:33:35,537 --> 00:33:37,506
thousand names of the Goddess.

473
00:33:37,506 --> 00:33:43,697
She's very kind, She's "Shant Mudra" She's
absolutely tranquility, peace.

474
00:33:43,697 --> 00:33:48,767
On the other side, She's "Roudra" She's the
one who can kill people.

475
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:51,543
She can finish people.

476
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:54,617
She's absolutely wrathful.

477
00:33:54,642 --> 00:33:55,897
It's true, I accept, it is so.

478
00:33:55,897 --> 00:33:58,797
But it is so, so it is so.

479
00:33:58,797 --> 00:34:02,767
But you must understand My in full ways.

480
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:08,167
If you just understand in My one side, for
example, if you just understand Me to be a

481
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:14,817
very mild, compassionate, forgiving Mother,
then your are sadly mistaken.

482
00:34:14,817 --> 00:34:19,616
Because you might have to pay for something
that is very wrong you are doing to Sahaja

483
00:34:19,616 --> 00:34:26,837
Yoga, you are doing to your brothers and sisters,
maybe doing to yourself, or maybe to Me.

484
00:34:26,837 --> 00:34:29,267
So the other side will definitely punish you.

485
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:38,277
So you must know there are many facets to
Sahaja Yoga and all these facets are to be

486
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,928
understood properly.

487
00:34:40,094 --> 00:34:44,266
Many people in the Sahaja Yoga also feel guilty.

488
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:48,257
Like now supposing while sitting before Me
they'll start giving bandhan, all right.

489
00:34:48,257 --> 00:34:53,186
I'll say, "Don't give bandhan when I'm sitting
there," then they'll feel guilty.

490
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:57,716
Try to understand the essence of everything.

491
00:34:57,716 --> 00:35:01,056
You have to go deeper into a subtler understanding.

492
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:04,246
Then you will not have this problem of Vishnumaya.

493
00:35:04,246 --> 00:35:15,703
The subtler understanding should be that we
have to see with our discretion, divine discretion,

494
00:35:15,743 --> 00:35:18,053
whatever is right and whatever is wrong.

495
00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:20,594
We don't have to judge it mentally.

496
00:35:20,594 --> 00:35:24,293
That's why I've seen people they sit down
for meditation for three hours.

497
00:35:24,293 --> 00:35:25,293
What is the need?

498
00:35:25,293 --> 00:35:26,913
Ten minutes is sufficient.

499
00:35:26,913 --> 00:35:31,613
But the thing is when they don't understand
the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga they behave

500
00:35:31,613 --> 00:35:37,553
in such a funny, gross, maddening manner that
even there have been people who have been

501
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:43,254
reporting and saying that Sahaja Yoga is a
thing that makes people mad, they start behaving

502
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:48,423
in a funny manner, they do funny actions and
all that.

503
00:35:48,423 --> 00:35:53,244
So all the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga is to
be understood.

504
00:35:53,244 --> 00:35:57,494
This is how you will become the part and parcel
of the whole.

505
00:35:57,494 --> 00:35:58,944
The subtleties of Sahaja Yoga.

506
00:35:58,944 --> 00:36:04,573
There are many who do not know even what are
the chakras on the feet are.

507
00:36:04,573 --> 00:36:11,903
They do not know what is the way one has to
behave in Sahaja Yoga so that we express our

508
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,833
maximum love.

509
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:18,403
So many there are ways of handling things.

510
00:36:18,403 --> 00:36:25,734
If you really accept that you have to be a
subtler being you'll be surprised, you will

511
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:32,363
be endowed with such capacities that you can
handle any number of people, anytime, any

512
00:36:32,363 --> 00:36:35,613
nationality, you will know everything about
it.

513
00:36:35,613 --> 00:36:38,393
Because subtlety means you go to the essence
of everything.

514
00:36:38,393 --> 00:36:44,964
If you go to the essence of everything then
you start seeing what is built on the essence.

515
00:36:44,964 --> 00:36:52,024
It is very easy to deal with a person if you
see the essence of everything.

516
00:36:52,024 --> 00:36:58,694
So for Sahaja Yoga it is important to know
that left Vishuddhi is just avoiding the subject.

517
00:36:58,694 --> 00:37:00,954
You are not facing it.

518
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:04,304
Secondly, you cannot go to the subtler thing.

519
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:10,194
Another thing, which catches left Vishuddhi
is of course smoking, as you know drugs, and

520
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:14,714
also tobacco, is very bad for left Vishuddhi.

521
00:37:14,714 --> 00:37:23,044
But the worst of all in the left Vishuddhi,
is the mantras given by wrong gurus.

522
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:25,883
Because that is the essence.

523
00:37:25,883 --> 00:37:30,964
Mantras are the essence of what one says.

524
00:37:30,964 --> 00:37:36,014
So what happens to you, that if your left
Vishuddhi is not all right, even if you say

525
00:37:36,014 --> 00:37:38,484
mantras, they are not effective.

526
00:37:38,484 --> 00:37:47,923
Whatever mantras you say with your left Vishuddhi
are still half-baked, are not fully vibrated,

527
00:37:47,923 --> 00:37:50,264
because of left Vishuddhi problem.

528
00:37:50,264 --> 00:37:56,264
But if you say Mantras without the left Vishuddhi
problem then the mantras become absolutely

529
00:37:56,264 --> 00:38:05,142
complete, or most effective, or as you say,
that Purnatwa is the completion.

530
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:06,374
It has the full effect.

531
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:44,392
So this is one thing is to see that you make
everyone understand that we are all collectively

532
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:51,427
bound, and then you won't feel like hurting
anyone, or troubling anyone, or saying anything

533
00:38:51,427 --> 00:38:52,427
bad.

534
00:38:52,427 --> 00:38:55,336
But if you are not collectively conscious
then you will do it.

535
00:38:55,336 --> 00:38:56,356
You will do it.

536
00:38:56,356 --> 00:38:58,887
You will hurt others.

537
00:38:58,887 --> 00:38:59,887
You will torture others.

538
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:00,887
You will take advantage of them.

539
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:03,756
You might exploit them, you might do anything.

540
00:39:03,756 --> 00:39:08,627
But if you know you are part and parcel of
the whole, if you know, in the sense, if you

541
00:39:08,627 --> 00:39:13,927
know on your central nervous system when it
becomes part and parcel of your being that

542
00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:20,606
you know, it is a sort of an awareness within
you which makes you feel that you are part

543
00:39:20,606 --> 00:39:26,667
and parcel of the whole, you cannot commit
mistakes, and then you do not feel guilty.

544
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:36,956
So today is the day of a very big relationship
between brother and sister where a sister

545
00:39:36,956 --> 00:39:39,917
never feels guilty and brother never feels
guilty.

546
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:44,947
Sisters and brothers should never feel guilty
about themselves and they should always openly

547
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:49,377
tell whatever they think wrong or whatever
they think is right.

548
00:39:49,377 --> 00:39:54,346
There is no harm, a sister can always go and
correct the brother, and a brother can always

549
00:39:54,346 --> 00:39:56,233
come and correct the sister.

550
00:39:56,258 --> 00:40:02,238
This is the relationship in which nobody should
feel hurt and bad, because this is the purest

551
00:40:02,238 --> 00:40:04,839
relationship that you could think of.

552
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:10,698
As mother, if she tells something, the difference
of age is so much that you may not understand.

553
00:40:10,698 --> 00:40:16,118
Maybe if the father says something the children
may not understand, the difference of age

554
00:40:16,118 --> 00:40:22,028
is too much and also the norms that we have
created of saying that there's a generation

555
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:25,468
gap and all this nonsense that is also in
the head.

556
00:40:25,468 --> 00:40:31,458
But supposing a brother and sister, if they,
between themselves, understand Sahaja Yoga,

557
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:37,768
they have every right to say whatever is wrong
between them and work it out - not to put

558
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,408
it as a guilt.

559
00:40:39,408 --> 00:40:42,449
But now with Rakhi sister is even better.

560
00:40:42,449 --> 00:40:48,278
Now with Rakhi sister we have established
a beautiful atmosphere that somebody who is

561
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:53,349
a brother, you cannot have any funny relationships
with that person.

562
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:59,829
It kills all your flirtations, all your funny,
funny relationships that one develops, all

563
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:10,629
kinds of marriage breaking problems, and people
going astray, once you have understood the

564
00:41:10,629 --> 00:41:17,748
principle that we have to first settle ourselves
on very holy relationship with each other.

565
00:41:17,748 --> 00:41:23,158
This is the way, in Sahaja Yoga, we establish
that holy relationship.

566
00:41:23,158 --> 00:41:31,958
And moreover, one has to see that this holy
relationship gives you joy, happiness, and

567
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:32,958
pleasure.

568
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:38,419
It is not just a holy relationship of some
force or some sort of a thing.

569
00:41:38,419 --> 00:41:42,478
Even if you cannot give anything to your sister,
or the brother cannot do anything for the

570
00:41:42,478 --> 00:41:43,628
sister, doesn't matter.

571
00:41:43,628 --> 00:41:50,198
The relationship is in the heart, and is felt
very much and when you feel it, that relationship,

572
00:41:50,198 --> 00:41:55,099
that sweetness of purity, of holiness, flows.

573
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:59,468
I know of some people who have sacrificed
such a lot for the brothers and so much for

574
00:41:59,468 --> 00:42:01,199
the sisters.

575
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:07,448
So one has to understand this relationship
is to be kept very clean, beautiful, and absolutely

576
00:42:07,448 --> 00:42:10,615
open - there should be no formality in it.

577
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,546
That a brother should go and say, "I'm sorry,"
and the sister should go and say, "I'm sorry."

578
00:42:14,571 --> 00:42:19,688
You have to be open and tell - you should
never feel bad about your brother or sister.

579
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:22,252
But it can be the other way around.

580
00:42:22,277 --> 00:42:27,827
I have seen people, like there was a bhootish
woman, who turned out to be very bhootish,

581
00:42:27,827 --> 00:42:31,597
and then somebody said, "But she's my Rakhi
sister."

582
00:42:31,597 --> 00:42:32,737
So what?

583
00:42:32,737 --> 00:42:35,638
As soon as she becomes bhootish there's no
Rakhi.

584
00:42:35,638 --> 00:42:38,853
Impurity, any impurity walking in, no Rakhi
anymore.

585
00:42:38,878 --> 00:42:39,933
Finished.

586
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,528
That's broken long time back.

587
00:42:41,553 --> 00:42:44,768
You have to have pure relationships of pure
personalities.

588
00:42:44,793 --> 00:42:50,158
You cannot have impure personalities, "and
then I must help, I have a weakness for the"

589
00:42:50,158 --> 00:42:55,148
- it has created lots of problems for Me in
America this Rakhi sister business, you see,

590
00:42:55,148 --> 00:43:01,567
she's the Rakhi sister of that, and this Rakhi
sister just started creating a kind of a problem

591
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:11,268
of a, we can say, intrigue, and she started
telephoning to her Rakhi brothers, and all

592
00:43:11,268 --> 00:43:14,499
Rakhi brothers joined in that intrigue.

593
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:18,477
It should not, in any way, cover your discretion.

594
00:43:18,477 --> 00:43:21,997
That's why the discretion stands in between.

595
00:43:21,997 --> 00:43:26,047
To understand when Rakhi sister is telling
you something - is it going against Sahaja

596
00:43:26,047 --> 00:43:27,334
Yoga or for Sahaja Yoga?

597
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,947
That discretion is in between.

598
00:43:29,947 --> 00:43:37,067
Before you go to this point you have a discretion
here to see for yourself that this Rakhi relationship

599
00:43:37,067 --> 00:43:43,297
has to be nourishing, supporting, helping
Sahaja Yoga.

600
00:43:43,297 --> 00:43:47,947
Other than that it doesn't exist.

601
00:43:47,947 --> 00:43:52,607
We are brothers and sisters in Sahaja Yoga.

602
00:43:52,632 --> 00:44:01,535
Anything that breaks it, there's no relationship
at all, anyway.

603
00:44:01,868 --> 00:44:09,047
If you understand this simple thing I think
we have done a good job today.

604
00:44:09,072 --> 00:44:11,513
May God Bless you!
