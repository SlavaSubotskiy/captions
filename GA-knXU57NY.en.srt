1
00:00:06,478 --> 00:00:15,553
Today we are celebrating the opening
of the Sahasrara on this day.

2
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:23,501
I must say it was a great happening
that took place

3
00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:27,226
for all the humanity.

4
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:33,742
It was such an achievement which I never
realized before,

5
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:39,029
now I can see, that without Self
Realization

6
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,450
it would have been impossible to talk
to people.

7
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:52,508
When this happened

8
00:00:56,336 --> 00:01:02,012
I thought that, how will I talk to people
about it,

9
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:07,665
because no one would understand Me,

10
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:15,383
and it would be a big mistake on My part,

11
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:21,202
to say something about Sahasrara.

12
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:33,041
Because even about Sahasrara, nowhere
in the scriptures somethings was described.

13
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:41,632
It was absolutely an ambiguous description,
I would say, where people could not

14
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:47,893
have even thought that there is a realm
beyond Sahasrara.

15
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:58,052
And one has to enter into that realm where
is the reality.

16
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:10,363
That time, what I saw around Me, I felt is
all darkness,

17
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:15,378
and unless and until there are many lights,

18
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:22,455
people will never realize that how
important it is to have lights.

19
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:28,060
It is a human error, also, all the time,

20
00:02:28,313 --> 00:02:35,507
that if somebody achieves something,
then they put that person onto a shelf.

21
00:02:35,707 --> 00:02:40,839
For example, Christ - all right, He was
Christ - we are not Christ.

22
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,527
Mohammed Sahib, He was Mohammed Sahib -
we are not Mohammed Sahib.

23
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:50,339
Rama was Rama, Krishna was Krishna. We are
not that.

24
00:02:51,228 --> 00:02:56,187
How can you expect human beings to behave
like Them?

25
00:02:56,387 --> 00:03:02,698
So, absolutely they are separated,
the divine personalities -

26
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:07,186
away, very much away, from human
personalities.

27
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:15,213
It was just a adoration, I can say, faith,

28
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:19,982
but when they said, "We tried to follow
Them," they could not.

29
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:27,571
They could not follow Them, because I think
human movement

30
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:36,838
is on parallel lines with the Divine and
these lines do not meet,

31
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:43,207
unless and until you give them Self
Realization.

32
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:50,301
Human level is moving on another plane

33
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:55,534
and it has to come up to a higher plane

34
00:03:55,734 --> 00:04:02,069
to understand that what they know is not
reality.

35
00:04:03,606 --> 00:04:08,558
I wouldn't say what is needed for that,

36
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:15,371
 because in My own experience, all kinds
of people came to Sahaja Yoga.

37
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:19,174
There’re people described to be very bad,
cruel

38
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,715
and other ones who were very licentious,
this, that -

39
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:29,100
then another ones who were cheats and they
said, "Mother they are horrible people."

40
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:40,641
But I've seen that every human being is
as if made of the same character,

41
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:48,050
as far as the Spirit is concerned. Outside
they may be different to look at,

42
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:54,355
 their way of talking may be different,
their styles may be different,

43
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:58,662
their fondness for things may be different,

44
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:04,717
but inside they are all very beautiful.

45
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:12,141
And this I found out, one after another.

46
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:17,256
You don't know how much it was giving Me
joy;

47
00:05:17,457 --> 00:05:24,739
not only joy, but also encouragement,
support and patience.

48
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:29,209
And then now, you see, how Sahaja Yoga
has grown.

49
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,447
The greatest thing has now happened is,
which I realize,

50
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:39,713
I'm very happy about it, that Sahaja Yogis
feel very responsible about Sahaja Yoga.

51
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:49,415
And they feel that they have to spread this
enlightenment everywhere.

52
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:57,882
It's their innate desire now to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

53
00:05:58,082 --> 00:06:03,324
Firstly it was that they should become
spirits.

54
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:10,969
Before that, also there were some people
who didn't actually seek the Spirit,

55
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:19,423
but they also became Sahaja Yogis. And I'm
surprised, with some of you,

56
00:06:19,622 --> 00:06:24,058
that I never expected that they would go
so far -

57
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,445
and suddenly you hear that such and such
a person

58
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:32,386
has gone there, has done this, has done
this.

59
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:37,899
So, when you came into the realm of reality,

60
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:46,648
I don't know which principle you accepted
first, that's your understanding.

61
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:55,927
But one thing you realized that you are
definitely connected with the Divine.

62
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:08,155
Some people had tremendous experiences,
some had mild experiences,

63
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:15,472
but most of them, I saw, started believing
in themselves,

64
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:25,182
understanding themselves, and having
confidence about themselves.

65
00:07:25,698 --> 00:07:37,087
Because there are so many myths about God,
religion, gurus,

66
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:44,725
that when they saw the light of the Spirit,

67
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:49,994
which gave them sense of reality,

68
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:56,672
they’re as if they steadied their minds,
they steadied themselves.

69
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:04,555
All this happened, I must say, in a very
short time.

70
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:11,138
I didn't say that it took Me long,

71
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:15,805
or I had to go through lots of various
experiences.

72
00:08:16,006 --> 00:08:19,942
Because to Me, all these experiences are
nothing.

73
00:08:20,143 --> 00:08:26,808
If a ship is seaworthy, it can face all
kinds of

74
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:33,607
high tides and all kinds of sharks and
everything, without any difficulty

75
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:38,456
because it is seaworthy. So I didn't feel
that way,

76
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:41,423
but only I felt that from human level

77
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:48,429
to this spiritual level, to this Divine
level, when you are coming,

78
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:53,759
then some of that still lingers on,

79
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:59,656
some of that is still there. It has to be
cleansed,

80
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:07,348
it has to be brightened, we should say,
or absolutely enlightened.

81
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:16,792
But what was the great thing about Sahaja
Yoga, that you yourself did all that.

82
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:21,401
It is nice to say, "Mother, You did this,
You did that."

83
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:28,208
Maybe enlightenment part of it, but say now
there are lights here,

84
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:34,016
and these lights, unless and until they are
attended to, looked after,

85
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:42,702
and given oil of love, how can they go on
burning?

86
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:49,670
This is something, what I must say that you
people somehow or other realized

87
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:56,763
how important it was to become good Sahaja
Yogis.

88
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:07,164
Maybe introspection, I don't say, maybe
somebody else talked about it,

89
00:10:07,364 --> 00:10:11,880
maybe it's your own understanding.

90
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:18,631
Whatever it was, all of you tried to be
good Sahaja Yogis.

91
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:24,735
Of course, there are people who are
sometimes very angry with Me,

92
00:10:24,936 --> 00:10:29,898
like, "Why don't You cure my sister, or why
don't you cure My father,

93
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:34,811
if you are God?" This, that is there. But
makes no difference to Me,

94
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:41,240
because they're so frustrated, so upset,
so they are talking like that.

95
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,757
If you see one or two persons here and
there,

96
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:49,424
you see here thousands, such beautiful
people.

97
00:10:49,624 --> 00:10:59,045
It's complete emancipation of this earth,
of this globe

98
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:06,757
I'm sure will take place, if you people all
take up the responsibility.

99
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:13,783
The responsibility has certain problems,
which we should know.

100
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:35,596
When you feel responsible, you must know

101
00:11:35,797 --> 00:11:41,706
that you are not in charge, one thing.

102
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:50,829
Secondly, you also must know, that there
are so many other forces,

103
00:11:51,218 --> 00:12:01,002
so many angels and ganas are with you,
you are not alone.

104
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:07,503
So to think that you are doing anything

105
00:12:07,703 --> 00:12:13,019
will make you, maybe, egoistical.

106
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:18,661
At that time, what you have to do, is best
is to say, "All right,

107
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:23,775
I'm not doing anything, is the Divine that
is working it out."

108
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:28,282
Not that the Divine wants any credit from
you,

109
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:35,079
but by saying that, this balloon of ego
will not come up.

110
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:43,183
And you'll become humble and this humility
will definitely improve

111
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:49,012
this great tree of spirituality within you.

112
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:58,676
Definitely it will make you a very evolved
personality,

113
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:07,299
no doubt about it. But first of all, we
have to say, "I'm not doing anything".

114
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:16,771
It's very important to understand, when you
have spiritual authority to do things.

115
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:23,049
It is not a testing ground, I can tell you
this much. Many people think

116
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:29,392
that Mother is testing us. I'm not testing
you, you are testing yourself.

117
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:33,069
I'm not saying don't do this or don't do
that.

118
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:36,305
You are testing yourself, and now must know

119
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:41,591
that, you are in the beautiful garden
of reality,

120
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,861
where very few have entered.

121
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,311
And there in that garden, when you enter,

122
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:13,365
what do you see? Is, everything is full
of beauty.

123
00:14:15,163 --> 00:14:21,112
Every person has something sweet about
himself,

124
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:29,843
because all other Sahaja Yogis are also
having the same kind of experiences

125
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:34,278
of this reality, which cannot be described
in words;

126
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:38,466
but you start feeling it, that oneness,
that nearness,

127
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:44,834
that friendship, without any expectation.

128
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:49,305
You start feeling, "Oh, it's a Sahaja Yogi."

129
00:14:49,505 --> 00:14:55,115
A kind of a completely integrated organism
as you become;

130
00:14:55,315 --> 00:15:00,596
you become an organization I should say,
which is a living organization.

131
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:06,460
 In that you do not feel you are something
separate -

132
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,868
any Sahaja Yogi, whether he is highly
placed

133
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:16,630
or he's not doing much in life.

134
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:29,398
This integration, this oneness,

135
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:34,145
this feeling of identification with others

136
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:40,637
makes you so large, so big, so great,
so powerful.

137
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:49,675
You are not alone, and you say, "I'm not
doing anything."

138
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:55,689
So you become so humble that you forget
all these

139
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:01,277
false ideas about class consciousness
or religion consciousness

140
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:06,462
or I don't know, all sorts of consciousness
people have.

141
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:11,606
I don't know much about these consciousnesses
that human beings suffer from,

142
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:17,187
but I've seen how it happens.

143
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:25,846
And when that humility becomes your
character, not that you are humble

144
00:16:26,046 --> 00:16:31,895
because there's something to be done,
you are humble.

145
00:16:33,732 --> 00:16:36,429
When people are doing some sort of say,
business,

146
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:43,463
they will be extremely humble and nice,
but they will be very unkind otherwise.

147
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:48,139
Here then, you become absolutely humble

148
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,858
and there's no duality in your personality
left.

149
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:58,316
But that doesn't mean you become weak.

150
00:16:58,515 --> 00:17:03,429
Humility is only possible for people who
are strong,

151
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:12,438
because they don't need any reactions,
they don't need any protection.

152
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:19,254
Their humility keeps them protected also,
very much.

153
00:17:20,183 --> 00:17:27,343
So, you just start thinking or feeling -
thinking is a funny word -

154
00:17:27,544 --> 00:17:33,411
feeling, that you are a small dust particle.

155
00:17:33,851 --> 00:17:38,961
At the same time you feel you are the whole
sky.

156
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:47,147
It depends on you, where you are, what you
are doing,

157
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,253
what you are seeing, what you are
witnessing.

158
00:17:53,496 --> 00:18:03,449
Sometimes you feel that all these big, big
johnnies are useless.

159
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:08,878
You feel, "Nothing to worry about them,
very small,"

160
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:13,137
and with some people you feel you are
very small.

161
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:19,847
Such a flexible temperament you developed

162
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:24,802
and that makes you subtler and subtler,

163
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,652
because you can penetrate into anything,
any subject,

164
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:34,502
any personality, any understanding,
any book,

165
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:41,703
anything - any enterprise in a very subtle
manner,

166
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:49,610
and you immediately see what is to be done,
because you become so subtle.

167
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:57,534
And then when you become very great, then
you start thinking -

168
00:18:57,735 --> 00:19:04,054
or I should say feeling - what you can do
to help so many people,

169
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:08,652
to do this great job, to do that.

170
00:19:14,698 --> 00:19:23,711
This, when happens to you, they don't think
that you are egoistical,

171
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:29,354
nor you should think that you are very
small.

172
00:19:31,311 --> 00:19:40,022
Only thing is now you are the Spirit and
Spirit is very subtle.

173
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:49,314
It's a very subtle light, but It can
penetrate into anything,

174
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:53,881
It could expand into anything,

175
00:19:54,955 --> 00:20:00,402
It can remain anywhere or It can disappear
anywhere.

176
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:09,469
This subtle personality that you are,
which is your Spirit,

177
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:16,768
you even don't use It, but It uses you
all the time.

178
00:20:16,968 --> 00:20:22,993
Without your knowledge It uses you. So
the second thing should be

179
00:20:23,193 --> 00:20:28,199
that you should not determine what you are
going to do.

180
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:35,145
"What I have to do - if I have decided,
I must do like that."

181
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:43,582
Whatever you have decided is all right,
but if it does not materialize,

182
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:49,593
there's nothing to worry, there's nothing
to be upset,

183
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:57,334
there's nothing to be overly nervous
about it.

184
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,855
I'll give you an example.

185
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:09,460
One day I was going to America, and
of course, you know as it is,

186
00:21:09,661 --> 00:21:14,763
as all the Sahaja Yogis are, they get quite
worried,

187
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:18,929
"Now, Mother has to go to America!" I mean,
you see, everybody's upset,

188
00:21:19,129 --> 00:21:25,537
they are looking at the time, "Now time is
this, time is that." I was just smiling.

189
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:30,539
I said, "I have to go to America, why are
you worried?".

190
00:21:31,848 --> 00:21:37,689
And suddenly one of the Sahaja Yogi's child
fell down and broke her hand

191
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,622
and she couldn't move her fingers.

192
00:21:42,143 --> 00:21:47,247
So, I was just coming out, and as soon as
he brought the child,

193
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:52,450
I said "All right, I'm not going just now
to the airport."

194
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:57,247
They were very upset, "How's She's not
going to the airport?"

195
00:21:57,447 --> 00:22:01,734
As if all the heavens are going to fall
down or what?

196
00:22:04,371 --> 00:22:07,066
But I said, "Now, let Me see the child."

197
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:10,563
I treated the child; the child was
all right.

198
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:13,427
"All right, I said, let's now go to
the airport."

199
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:15,700
And they were saying, "Mother, the plane
must have left."

200
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:19,365
“It's all right, doesn't matter, let's go
to the airport."

201
00:22:19,643 --> 00:22:24,487
[We] went to the airport and this plane
that was going to take Me

202
00:22:24,687 --> 00:22:28,263
was just there because there was something
wrong with the plane

203
00:22:28,464 --> 00:22:30,203
and there was another plane going
to Washington,

204
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:35,320
and I wanted actually to go to Washington,
instead of New York.

205
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,301
So, I was in the plane nicely going
to Washington.

206
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:46,196
But, one must know that you are not
doing it,

207
00:22:46,397 --> 00:22:52,203
everything is arranged and planned
and beautifully kept for you.

208
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:56,685
You decide something, all right, if your
decision is all right,

209
00:22:56,884 --> 00:22:59,245
if you have to do that, it will work out.

210
00:22:59,406 --> 00:23:03,984
If it doesn't work out, it should not have
been worked out.

211
00:23:04,514 --> 00:23:07,910
Now this is the difference between a person
who is a realized soul

212
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:10,892
and who is not a realized soul.

213
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:16,163
A realized soul person is not bothered

214
00:23:16,364 --> 00:23:23,530
what he wants, what he likes, what he's
fond of - he's not.

215
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,442
Whatever he gets is all right. Now, you
can see,

216
00:23:27,643 --> 00:23:33,905
you are living under this roof which is
so horrible, I mean –

217
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:41,526
there's no proper arrangements here,
nothing.

218
00:23:41,726 --> 00:23:46,248
I don't know how you are living here,
I mean, I just don't know what to do.

219
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:50,072
And we are trying to get a land and this
landowner

220
00:23:50,273 --> 00:23:53,161
is such a greedy fellow, but I don't mind
the greed part,

221
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:59,290
but still he's not yet giving us the land.
It's all right, now what to do?

222
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:03,786
But you all enjoy it, you don't mind -

223
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:06,986
otherwise normally people would say,
"You know, I want

224
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:12,013
this kind of a room, and I want this kind
of a house, and this and that."

225
00:24:12,213 --> 00:24:15,861
That you can live under any circumstances

226
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:22,739
because you don't worry about your physical
comfort any more.

227
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:29,650
What you think of - your own spiritual
comfort.

228
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:38,773
I have seen people, Sahaja Yogis,
so beautiful, even children,

229
00:24:38,974 --> 00:24:41,927
if there is a film going on - something
funny comes in,

230
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:44,939
immediately they all close their eyes,
"We don't want to see this".

231
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:49,009
Nobody has to tell them because, you see,
they are sort of - inside

232
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:56,597
they have built-in that subtle personality
which cannot stand nonsense.

233
00:24:57,164 --> 00:25:01,768
They won’t - may not say something, they
may not be harsh,

234
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:07,979
but just they shun and go away from such
places, automatically.

235
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:17,023
So, to describe the new personality is
this way:

236
00:25:17,494 --> 00:25:22,683
that in the nature we see, very clearly.

237
00:25:22,883 --> 00:25:29,018
In the nature what we see is, a tree grows,

238
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:36,089
now it has to expand, but it cannot, so
it does not.

239
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:44,478
If it can, it will, and also it tries

240
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:53,118
to bring all the leaves exposed to
the sunlight, somehow.

241
00:25:53,741 --> 00:25:59,337
I don't think the trees have that much
intelligence to organize it,

242
00:25:59,538 --> 00:26:04,755
but there is something that organizes
them so beautifully.

243
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:11,405
Now, it's not only one tree, thousands and
thousands and thousands and thousands.

244
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:20,373
The one who does all that, is the one with
whom you are in contact.

245
00:26:22,806 --> 00:26:30,843
The trees are not, they are just playing
into the hands of nature,

246
00:26:31,044 --> 00:26:37,275
but they cannot manipulate, maneuver,
understand

247
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:41,703
this Divine power, they cannot.

248
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:47,056
Animals cannot, even human beings cannot,

249
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:54,983
but you can, because you have crossed
the limit of this human bondage

250
00:26:55,184 --> 00:27:01,345
and now you are just like great citizens

251
00:27:01,545 --> 00:27:08,865
of the great realm of divinity.

252
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:15,461
So, this Divine Force helps you, works out
everything

253
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:23,807
and also It takes you, It guides you,
It manages you.

254
00:27:24,373 --> 00:27:34,288
So, what you have to do is to keep yourself
open for the guidance.

255
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:43,002
At the same time you must act, because
the guidance will also come from within,

256
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:48,986
by which you will know, "This is what I
have to do." Now supposing even then,

257
00:27:49,186 --> 00:27:56,904
you feel that this was not achieved by you
and you feel that,

258
00:27:57,436 --> 00:28:03,560
"Still I don't know why I couldn't get what
I wanted."

259
00:28:03,741 --> 00:28:08,819
Try to understand that is what is the best
for us.

260
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:14,280
But it never means that you should give up,

261
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,044
you should not desire. I have seen Sahaja
Yogis’ desires

262
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:28,280
are much more powerful than Mine. The reason
is: I am desireless,

263
00:28:28,735 --> 00:28:32,761
 I have no desires as such. Try to see,
find them out,

264
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:39,958
if I have any desires. I see I have
no desires of any kind

265
00:28:40,158 --> 00:28:46,234
or I do not earnestly want anything.

266
00:28:48,215 --> 00:28:52,869
That, you can say it's a very frivolous
temperament.

267
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:59,931
But it all, you see, [is] very different
with you people.

268
00:29:00,192 --> 00:29:05,441
You people are very differently made.

269
00:29:05,642 --> 00:29:08,915
Because you have achieved something.

270
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:25,797
I have not achieved anything. I am what
I am.

271
00:29:26,745 --> 00:29:29,513
Because you’ve achieved something,

272
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:36,537
you know how you were and what you are now.

273
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:47,597
Because of your achievement, I think it is
a boon that whatever you desire works out.

274
00:29:48,974 --> 00:29:53,602
Because you have worked so hard, it's
a boon to you,

275
00:29:53,803 --> 00:29:58,913
it's a special blessing for you whatever
you desire.

276
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:04,537
So… so many times I have told you, "Now
don't desire anything which is not proper",

277
00:30:04,738 --> 00:30:13,128
because whatever you will desire, that
works out and that will be effective.

278
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:20,071
Now try to realize that you are no more
ordinary human beings.

279
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:25,729
You have crossed the bondage and now

280
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:30,266
you are not even in the Sahasrara, you are
beyond it.

281
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:39,024
Sahasrara is the limbic area and this
limbic area is closed

282
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:48,064
like a lotus and when you get your
Kundalini entering into it,

283
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:52,074
then this lotus opens like this.

284
00:30:53,229 --> 00:30:58,252
And that's what is - is written
in the Bible, that

285
00:30:59,947 --> 00:31:05,058
"I'll appear before you like tongues
of flames." It's the Divine saying.

286
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:11,708
So these petals are nothing but nerves
which are enlightened,

287
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:17,944
just like these, and they look like flames.

288
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:24,759
 But these flames are not with any heat,

289
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:30,177
they call it in Sanskrit tapa-hina, no heat.

290
00:31:30,377 --> 00:31:37,676
Extremely cooling, soothing, beautifully
burning.

291
00:31:39,368 --> 00:31:44,712
So when this Sahasrara Lotus opens,

292
00:31:45,093 --> 00:31:52,586
then the Kundalini pierces through your
fontanel and you get your Realization.

293
00:31:54,907 --> 00:31:57,871
This is what has happened to you.

294
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:05,277
Now only thing is to keep this Lotus open

295
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:13,082
and there where we fail, sometimes,

296
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:20,342
because still there are some lingering
human failings within us.

297
00:32:21,469 --> 00:32:29,327
Firstly, it is, as it is, covered with
the ego and the conditioning,

298
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:33,145
or we can [say] superego, the two balloons.

299
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:42,268
These two balloons, again and again, try
to close the Sahasrara.

300
00:32:47,963 --> 00:32:50,901
So you have to be,

301
00:32:58,794 --> 00:33:01,775
you have to be on the guard,

302
00:33:03,637 --> 00:33:09,347
that "What is closing my Sahasrara?"

303
00:33:10,752 --> 00:33:16,136
The first is ego, which how to attack,

304
00:33:16,337 --> 00:33:21,451
because you want to attack your ego, you'll
have to attack through ego only,

305
00:33:22,055 --> 00:33:25,233
that's the only vehicle.

306
00:33:29,526 --> 00:33:35,020
So, we have this state of Nirvichara,

307
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:39,743
of thoughtless awareness, where we have
to go.

308
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:46,941
But the simple thing to do is very
practical.

309
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:53,864
Try to understand why you are being
egoistical, with whom are you angry?

310
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:58,797
Why are you angry?

311
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:04,924
What makes you think to dominate someone
or to control someone

312
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,366
or to check someone? Why?

313
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,649
The mind will not answer.

314
00:34:14,501 --> 00:34:17,866
The simple thing, if you can do,

315
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:23,783
that whatever things that upsets you or
makes you feel very great,

316
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:31,360
try to understand that compared to you,
nothing is greater.

317
00:34:33,729 --> 00:34:37,217
Compared to your love, nothing is greater.

318
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:40,544
Compared to your compassion, nothing is
greater

319
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:46,367
because in this there is the light
of the Divine flowing.

320
00:34:48,744 --> 00:34:52,545
You hate someone, you get angry with
someone -

321
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:57,450
just know that you have to love that person.

322
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:04,219
Now, how will you love that person?

323
00:35:04,419 --> 00:35:11,812
There's no way to have any measurement
of that, but love itself will suggest

324
00:35:12,013 --> 00:35:17,403
how satisfied you are feeling, how happy
you are feeling.

325
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:24,543
I'll give you an example. The other day
I received a letter

326
00:35:25,154 --> 00:35:30,714
from someone challenging Me very much,
from Poland -

327
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:34,617
that her mother is sick with something,
cancer or something,

328
00:35:34,818 --> 00:35:39,027
and challenging Me all the time. "If You
are God, You must create…

329
00:35:39,243 --> 00:35:44,159
cure my mother, if You are God, do this,
do that, do that ..."

330
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:47,123
Very amusing.

331
00:35:49,818 --> 00:35:54,350
I said, "All right." I put my attention
to this lady,

332
00:35:54,550 --> 00:36:01,615
perhaps the mother is better. But, instead
of getting angry, I said,

333
00:36:01,816 --> 00:36:05,603
"She's so frustrated, she's so upset,
she's so worried,

334
00:36:05,804 --> 00:36:08,607
even if she says, "If You are God," she's
challenging Me, it's all right,

335
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:09,887
makes no difference.

336
00:36:10,088 --> 00:36:15,331
Whether she calls Me God or not God,
makes no difference. Whatever I am, I am.

337
00:36:15,532 --> 00:36:22,407
So, instead of getting angry, I felt
tremendous compassion for her.

338
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:27,839
She's a human being and her mother is
so sick

339
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,295
and that's the only source of her life,

340
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:37,622
then I can understand why she is so upset.

341
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:46,667
So, if you just try, which you can do very
easily,

342
00:36:46,868 --> 00:36:50,987
very easily, it's not difficult,

343
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:56,112
because you are realized souls, I'm talking
to saints.

344
00:36:56,635 --> 00:37:05,781
If you just put your attention on a person
with love,

345
00:37:06,761 --> 00:37:10,705
then what happens, you get understanding.

346
00:37:10,936 --> 00:37:17,343
Understanding of that person, you realize,

347
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:22,365
as if identified with that person.

348
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:28,068
Then you realize, "If I was in her place,
as a human being,

349
00:37:28,269 --> 00:37:33,809
what I would have felt? This desperation,
this anger.

350
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:38,695
If I was that, if I was the same type
of person,

351
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:44,095
with the same kind of problems, then what
would I do?"

352
00:37:47,857 --> 00:37:53,841
That solves the problem. So
the identification part,

353
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:57,441
you have such powers, I told you can
penetrate.

354
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:02,408
The identification with another is very
important.

355
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:12,541
And you can do it, because you are
realized souls, you can do it.

356
00:38:13,783 --> 00:38:19,350
Just place yourself in the same position,
like the other person is,

357
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:27,707
and then you'll realize that you have
powers of love,

358
00:38:27,907 --> 00:38:34,902
and identification is the only way I think
one can understand love.

359
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:47,610
This ego will immediately sucked in

360
00:38:47,811 --> 00:38:54,420
as soon as you put your loving attention
on that person.

361
00:38:59,451 --> 00:39:04,200
In your lifetime you'll get so many
experiences like that,

362
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:14,477
that you'll be amazed at yourself, "How can
I do all these things?"

363
00:39:15,346 --> 00:39:19,057
Because you are a realized soul.

364
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:26,520
Also, as I said,

365
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:32,697
when you are identified with another
person,

366
00:39:33,293 --> 00:39:38,923
you put that person in charge of divinity -

367
00:39:44,657 --> 00:39:50,472
just a feeling of oneness.

368
00:39:53,495 --> 00:40:00,410
Sometimes, also, we have very wrong ideas
about ourselves and about others.

369
00:40:03,326 --> 00:40:09,638
In small, small things also, we have our
own ideas about something.

370
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:17,058
Say, some sort of a living standard some
people have, we like it.

371
00:40:17,259 --> 00:40:21,683
"I don't like it, I like it and I don't
like it."

372
00:40:21,884 --> 00:40:27,689
Not a saint, saint never says that.

373
00:40:28,602 --> 00:40:30,463
That time, when you say that,

374
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:34,227
you are falsely identifying yourself with
the baddha of the other person.

375
00:40:34,428 --> 00:40:36,782
For example, the one, now supposing

376
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:42,200
somebody has done such a beautiful flower
arrangement.

377
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:47,441
Instead of appreciating and enjoying it,

378
00:40:47,642 --> 00:40:52,618
if you come and say, "I don't like this,
this could have been better than this."

379
00:40:57,138 --> 00:41:01,475
Just to sh..(show), I don't know why people
say like that,

380
00:41:02,237 --> 00:41:05,279
but if you identify yourself with the man
who has done it,

381
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,440
or the gentleman who has done it,

382
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:13,587
you will enjoy it the way that person
enjoyed it doing it.

383
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:18,797
Because you are just thinking about your
self - self-opinionatedness

384
00:41:18,998 --> 00:41:21,704
with which you think that this is not done
so good,

385
00:41:21,905 --> 00:41:26,222
that could have been better, this could
have been better.

386
00:41:30,095 --> 00:41:33,718
 Who are you to judge anyone?

387
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:47,842
This criticizing nature comes from
a terrible misunderstanding about oneself.

388
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:56,058
What are we? Why should we judge anybody
else, are we paid for it?

389
00:41:56,259 --> 00:42:00,198
So why waste energy on judging others?

390
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:10,091
We should see what is good in others,

391
00:42:12,016 --> 00:42:15,755
because in the realm of reality, it’s
all good, everything fine,

392
00:42:15,956 --> 00:42:18,472
everything first class.

393
00:42:20,764 --> 00:42:28,594
But if you are trying to see what's wrong
with others, then you are not in reality.

394
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:35,325
You can watch, you can witness,

395
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:41,660
but you do not get upset with it or you
do not even say

396
00:42:41,861 --> 00:42:45,714
something that would upset others.

397
00:42:46,716 --> 00:42:49,630
You're watching it, it's all beautiful,

398
00:42:49,831 --> 00:42:55,051
I mean, just the joy of the person who
put it,

399
00:42:55,252 --> 00:42:58,887
all these beautiful things, of all
the persons,

400
00:42:59,088 --> 00:43:01,734
is just bubbling through that,

401
00:43:01,935 --> 00:43:06,715
but unless and until you are identified
with those who have done this,

402
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:11,904
you might say this was - this should have
been better, that should have been...

403
00:43:12,245 --> 00:43:14,970
You can be in the same position.

404
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:17,717
Supposing you do something, another one
will come and say,

405
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:20,952
"Oh, you should have done it this way,
that way." Wasting our energy

406
00:43:21,152 --> 00:43:25,756
for nothing at all, our energy is spiritual
energy.

407
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,558
Then again you become like the sky,
I told you, the greatest,

408
00:43:31,856 --> 00:43:35,938
you are too great to bother about these
things.

409
00:43:36,941 --> 00:43:43,059
Wasting our energy on very, very trivial
things and useless things

410
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:47,601
and just making yourselves small.

411
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:56,317
But if this spiritual energy is used -
because you can use it,

412
00:43:56,518 --> 00:44:04,467
you are the ones only who can manipulate
it, not the trees, not the flowers -

413
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:11,335
then what you will do is to create oceans
of joys.

414
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:19,315
So then we come to Sahaj, what has Sahaj
given you is all right.

415
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,041
But what have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

416
00:44:25,688 --> 00:44:29,217
What have I given to Sahaja Yoga?

417
00:44:32,074 --> 00:44:36,393
Have I created oceans of joys for others?

418
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:48,863
What kindness I've shown, what compassion
I've shown,

419
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:52,415
what love I have expressed?

420
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:57,772
All right, whatever Sahaja Yoga has given,
we have taken it for granted.

421
00:44:58,724 --> 00:45:05,328
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga, they think
it is a contract, already signed,

422
00:45:05,529 --> 00:45:09,386
and if this thing doesn't work out, then
what is it? They say, "We had a contract

423
00:45:09,586 --> 00:45:14,974
with God," and they say, "We have not
been awarded fully

424
00:45:15,175 --> 00:45:21,702
for whatever we have paid, whatever we
have done."

425
00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:25,114
But what have you done

426
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:33,066
in this realm of reality?

427
00:45:33,614 --> 00:45:37,391
Have you enjoyed the reality?

428
00:45:38,748 --> 00:45:49,289
Have you felt the joy of this real love
of Divine?

429
00:45:52,325 --> 00:46:02,612
Are you dissolved into that, or you're
still standing on the shores watching?

430
00:46:03,858 --> 00:46:09,494
You can create, you are quite capable
of creating

431
00:46:09,695 --> 00:46:15,833
tremendous joy, tremendous happiness
and peace.

432
00:46:16,372 --> 00:46:25,119
See the world today, in what condition
it is, it's complete turmoil, confusion,

433
00:46:27,049 --> 00:46:40,812
all kinds of corrupt and destructive things
going on.

434
00:46:42,265 --> 00:46:46,757
So ugly this world has become.

435
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:51,484
Can you beautify it?

436
00:46:54,155 --> 00:46:58,177
You can, because you can transform people.

437
00:46:58,378 --> 00:47:05,849
But if you are not yourself a beautiful
Sahaja Yogi, how can you?

438
00:47:08,107 --> 00:47:14,635
So, it is our attention on ourselves when
we work out

439
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:22,164
that we have to bring others into this
realm of reality.

440
00:47:23,314 --> 00:47:30,511
This is one side ourselves, where we
have to understand our subtleties.

441
00:47:30,712 --> 00:47:35,861
The another side is that we are still
identified

442
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:40,521
with things which we should not have been
identified.

443
00:47:42,763 --> 00:47:45,594
We can just find out.

444
00:47:47,844 --> 00:47:57,457
Identified with ideas, identified with some
sort of a consciousness.

445
00:48:00,437 --> 00:48:10,667
All these things make you really - to be
very frank, they befool you.

446
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:16,882
All the fools, you see,

447
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:23,642
who are conditioned are really - I don't
know what to say about them,

448
00:48:23,843 --> 00:48:33,765
because they are like a train which has
no driver.

449
00:48:34,805 --> 00:48:38,423
God knows when it is going to collide.

450
00:48:38,955 --> 00:48:44,933
Because such people who are identified,
I know -

451
00:48:45,134 --> 00:48:48,964
now you must have seen also, those who go
to church,

452
00:48:49,165 --> 00:48:52,826
get ready nicely, go to church, sit down
there, sing hymns,

453
00:48:53,027 --> 00:48:57,097
come home and again quarrel and fight.

454
00:48:59,633 --> 00:49:03,683
But if they see a church, they'll bow.

455
00:49:04,064 --> 00:49:07,424
But nothing goes inside, out of that
church.

456
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:11,626
Or there are, who are like, you see you
must have seen, the Jews, you see,

457
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:16,368
wailing wall they have got, before that
they go, do all kinds of things

458
00:49:16,569 --> 00:49:20,459
and what happens to them? Nothing.

459
00:49:20,762 --> 00:49:25,369
Same with the Muslims, they are so
conditioned,

460
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:30,965
I mean, you cannot describe their
conditionings, so stupid they are.

461
00:49:31,695 --> 00:49:36,936
And these conditionings go on making fool
out of us.

462
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:46,222
I've known so many people like that.

463
00:49:50,476 --> 00:49:58,985
Once in My own life, I was with some
relation of Mine.

464
00:49:59,186 --> 00:50:03,229
This gentleman used to get up at four
o'clock

465
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:08,826
and would start singing some sort of a Ram
Raksha. The whole house is sleeping,

466
00:50:09,027 --> 00:50:12,811
children are sleeping, he's shouting
at the top of his voice.

467
00:50:13,012 --> 00:50:19,234
I said, "What is the matter? Even Rama
might be sleeping at this time."

468
00:50:20,401 --> 00:50:24,854
But he would shout. And his bathing was
another thing,

469
00:50:25,054 --> 00:50:28,266
everybody knew he's having a bath,

470
00:50:28,467 --> 00:50:34,743
because he used to sing another shlokas
or something. Go on.

471
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:40,594
But it happened that, that I was
in the next room,

472
00:50:41,181 --> 00:50:43,690
and I heard something like,

473
00:50:43,891 --> 00:50:47,013
banging, banging, banging. I said,
"What's the matter?"

474
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:50,269
I thought he's suffering from epilepsy.
Or what?

475
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:55,278
So I rushed to other people and told them,
"This gentleman is suffering from epilepsy."

476
00:50:55,479 --> 00:50:59,593
He says, "No, he doesn't suffer." I said,
"Then why this sound coming?"

477
00:50:59,794 --> 00:51:05,474
"No, no, he is, he is rubbing that chandan,
You know, sandalwood."

478
00:51:05,674 --> 00:51:13,462
And with such a big thud every time, he was
putting that stone on the ground.

479
00:51:13,662 --> 00:51:16,348
"But I thought he had epilepsy."

480
00:51:16,549 --> 00:51:21,679
He said, "Whatever you may tell him, he
will never listen, he does that every day."

481
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:27,400
What is this? This we understand
as stupidity.

482
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:31,615
When we see others, when we see human
beings,

483
00:51:31,816 --> 00:51:38,828
but even realized souls, you are
in the realm of reality,

484
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:48,229
you do accept sometimes unreal things.
Because of age-old conditionings -

485
00:51:48,927 --> 00:51:52,552
your forefathers like this, his father was
like this, and your forefather's

486
00:51:52,753 --> 00:51:59,390
forefathers were like this, so that's
still coming. They call it genes.

487
00:52:00,438 --> 00:52:04,282
But in Sahaja Yoga these genes also change.

488
00:52:04,483 --> 00:52:09,833
So this kind of a conditioning which is
lingering on still

489
00:52:10,034 --> 00:52:15,789
to your bodies, to your minds, to your
emotions,

490
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:23,423
has to be seen and cleaned out, because
that kills the joy.

491
00:52:24,137 --> 00:52:28,470
That kills the full experience of reality.

492
00:52:30,036 --> 00:52:35,296
If you want to have a full experience
of the beauty of reality,

493
00:52:35,497 --> 00:52:40,211
then you should shed out all these things
which are really befooling you

494
00:52:40,412 --> 00:52:43,210
morning till evening.

495
00:52:44,174 --> 00:52:46,426
People take advantage of such people,
very much.

496
00:52:46,627 --> 00:52:48,907
As I've told you, entrepreneurs, you see,

497
00:52:49,108 --> 00:52:52,208
they'll start with one fashion, everybody
goes like that.

498
00:52:52,409 --> 00:52:55,161
But we are not brainless people.

499
00:52:55,362 --> 00:53:00,372
Not that we have brains, but also
enlightened brains.

500
00:53:01,087 --> 00:53:05,025
We do not take to things which are just
in the fashion

501
00:53:05,226 --> 00:53:08,941
or which are something, we don't.

502
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:22,036
What we do, we are of our own fashion.

503
00:53:23,988 --> 00:53:31,093
This is not ego, this is identification
with your own Spirit.

504
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:36,396
You won't take to anything stupid and
nonsensical,

505
00:53:36,597 --> 00:53:39,674
if you have the wisdom of your Spirit
in you.

506
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:46,462
So, in the realm of reality, we have
all the seven chakras,

507
00:53:46,663 --> 00:53:54,073
absolutely enlightened, integrated
and nourished.

508
00:53:55,916 --> 00:54:06,727
At that position what we see is ourselves,
as I said,

509
00:54:06,928 --> 00:54:14,549
as nothing limited, absolutely unlimited.

510
00:54:16,371 --> 00:54:21,850
Even (is/if) - when we say, we penetrate,
we do.

511
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:27,867
When we say we expand, we do. When we
contract, we do.

512
00:54:28,068 --> 00:54:32,899
It's absolutely a flexible personality

513
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:43,809
and a personality that creates peace, joy,
harmony.

514
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:53,797
With the Sahasrara opening, I'm sure
the whole world would be integrated,

515
00:54:55,352 --> 00:55:02,344
one day, and we’ll understand these problems

516
00:55:02,545 --> 00:55:11,233
that are facing us because of stupidity.

517
00:55:13,062 --> 00:55:17,272
This integration I'm sure will take place,

518
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:28,147
and when that takes place, you'll see
the life of the Divine

519
00:55:28,663 --> 00:55:38,400
will be absolutely outshining all these
darknesses or destructive forces.

520
00:55:38,804 --> 00:55:41,794
It's going to happen.

521
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:47,196
If so many Sahasraras could be opened out,

522
00:55:47,397 --> 00:55:53,278
then why not the Sahasrara of this world
also is opened out

523
00:55:53,479 --> 00:55:59,189
to truth and reality? It will.

524
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:04,765
So today, on such an important day for us,

525
00:56:04,966 --> 00:56:11,534
in the history of spirituality, I think
this is a very important day.

526
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:21,534
For us is to realize that we are
enlightened, we are the light of joy,

527
00:56:21,735 --> 00:56:27,821
light of compassion, light of love

528
00:56:29,849 --> 00:56:38,600
like the silent flames of the Sahasrara,
in different colors, beautifully dancing.

529
00:56:39,243 --> 00:56:47,114
Then we'll know what is the enjoyment
of reality is.

530
00:56:47,979 --> 00:56:51,515
May God bless you.
