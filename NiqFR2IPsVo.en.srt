1
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:23,110
Today is the third day of the Moon. Third
day of the Moon is Tritiya, is the special

2
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:58,800
day for the virgins. Kundalini is
the virgin desire. It is virgin because it
has not yet manifested itself. And also, on

3
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:26,400
the third center of Nabhi, the virgins appear
as shaktis of Guru.

4
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:47,080
As we have got ten Gurus which we regard as
the main Gurus they all had either their sister

5
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,840
or daughter as their shakti. In the Bible
it is said that, in the Old Testament, that

6
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:46,160
the one who will be coming will be born of
a virgin. And then the Jews would not accept

7
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:03,190
Christ so they said that “It’s not written
as virgin, it’s written ‘the girl’.”

8
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:18,450
Now in Sanskrit Language ‘girl’ and ‘the
virgin’ are one word. We did not have 80-year-old

9
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,620
girls as we have nowadays.

10
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:31,620
So the virginity of a woman meant that she
was a girl who was not married as yet or who

11
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:46,190
has not met her husband so far. That is the
essence of purity, which was the power of

12
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,180
the Guru Principle.

13
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:10,180
So, for a Guru who is in charge of leading
others into enlightenment, has to know that

14
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:27,150
his power is to be used as a virgin power
of pure power. A Guru cannot use this power

15
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:45,060
in a way an ordinary person can use. So his
relationship with his disciples whether they

16
00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:02,130
are boys or girls has to be absolutely pure.
The purity should be of such a limit that

17
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:18,390
a Guru should not accept anything from the
disciples. About this, lots of things has

18
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:34,670
been written by many saints especially in
Maharashtra. Also Kabirdas and Nanaka have

19
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:41,760
clearly talked against the people who have
relationship with their shishyas, or disciples,

20
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:50,760
either with greed or with lust. They have
called them as rakshasas. In the same way

21
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:03,860
the people who are today, supposed to be the
leaders, the Gurus, in Sahaja Yoga, have to

22
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:16,760
remember that their relationship with their
disciples has to be of complete purity and

23
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:30,320
virginity.

24
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,320
In the olden days it was all right that people
did not know about the punishments that can

25
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,600
fall upon such a person who uses his power
as a Guru for his own gratification. But today

26
00:16:54,950 --> 00:17:01,950
at this time when at this time…(Mother tells
off some children in Marathi for disturbing)…The

27
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:39,650
punishment that

28
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:55,850
can take place in those days of last judgement
could be very serious and as a Mother I have

29
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:06,890
to warn all of you, those who have started
their centers or those who are becoming Gurus

30
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:21,510
as leaders that you have to have a very detached
mind and clear cut understanding within yourself.

31
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:35,990
You can not mishandle money. You can not misappropriate
money, you can not use anything for your own

32
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:46,970
purpose which belongs to the collective. Nor
could you use anyone for the gratification

33
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:02,830
of your lust. If you have any such weaknesses
is better to get out of Sahaja Yoga for the

34
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:08,530
time being and come back when you are better
off.

35
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:15,530
There is no place in Sahaja Yoga for impure
people. Purity is to be worshipped out and

36
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,280
out.

37
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:29,280
As we say that in the West there’s sin against
the Mother. People don’t value their chastity

38
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:41,180
but in the East, specially in India, people
don’t know that they have to be absolutely

39
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:49,780
honest as far as their money is concerned.
They fall into traps, into temptations and

40
00:19:54,060 --> 00:20:01,060
then they get a very severe punishment, not
through Me but through the wrath of God almighty

41
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:13,540
because this is God’s work we are doing.

42
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:23,240
And the worst thing could be that we seek
power. If not these two things, we seek power

43
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:36,250
in Sahaja Yoga. To them it becomes like their
own domain and they start using, asserting,

44
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:53,630
their power over others. This cannot be possible.
It will not work out.

45
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Those who will try to dominate others just
for the satisfaction or their own ego will

46
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,940
suffer a lot.

47
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:21,940
Now the fourth type are the people who try
to put their conditionings on Sahaja Yoga.

48
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:32,990
Like somebody who is a Hindu and he is fasting
say, most of the days they fast, I don’t

49
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:42,500
know which one is fasting. So he’s fasting
say, on a Saturday and he tells people that

50
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,600
see now, I have to fast on Saturday because
after all, you see, I have been fasting for

51
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,600
all these days and all that. Or who has got
conditioning, like, I would like to marry

52
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:05,060
only a foreigner if I am a foreigner or if
I am an Indian I’ll marry an Indian. All

53
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:13,080
such conditions if a leader tries to put forward
and saying that, “Mother said so,” he’ll

54
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,880
be doubly punished.

55
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,880
We are belonging to the True Religion of a
true, pure universality. None of these artificial

56
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:53,660
things can bind us. This is one of the very
important subtle things, which we don’t

57
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:11,630
understand – that we are very much conditioned.
“We the English”, “we the Indians”

58
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:24,430
or “We x,y, z”. You are human beings.
God made only one world. He didn’t make

59
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:38,620
all these things. It’s all artificial, man-made.
You are born of one Mother and you are yogis

60
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:51,180
who have no bondages of this artificial nature.

61
00:23:54,270 --> 00:24:01,270
Everyone who claims to be a Guru has to realise
that he can not bound himself to any particular

62
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:12,430
mundane, outdated nonsensical ideas.
Gradually whatever the leaders will do will

63
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:26,250
be followed by the followers. So the leader
has to lead a life which is an ideal. A leader

64
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:42,620
who is very dominating, or who is very possessive
or aggressive, will create leaders who will

65
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,430
be of the same nature.
The another one who is very much conditioned

66
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:56,430
will create conditioned followers. And may
be, I may not find any relationship with them.

67
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:08,530
So we don’t want to have a priest class
as Gurus. Priests are different from Gurus.

68
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:17,120
We do not want people to take upon themselves
the laws of God and use them for their own

69
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:26,090
purposes.

70
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:33,090
Today is the day of the Gurus because is the
third day, the third Chakra of the Nabhi.

71
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:52,570
The same one we have the starting point of
the Mahalakshmi. Mahalakshmi energy starts

72
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:12,440
working after you have finished with the Lakshmi
tattwa. If the Gurus are still with, busy

73
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:29,280
with the Lakshmi tattwas, have no sense of
sacrifice, have no sense of detachment they

74
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,470
cannot be called as leaders.

75
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:43,470
The Mahalakshmi is the subtle form of our
hankering, of our desires, is the subtlest,

76
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:58,960
the epitome. Because first we search for power
through physical, mental, emotional and ultimately

77
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:15,600
we want to have spiritual powers also to impress
others.

78
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,600
In Sahaja Yoga you come here to dissolve all
your powers. You become so powerless that

79
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,140
all the powers of God Almighty start working
through you.

80
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,610
Supposing this instrument (pointing to the
microphone She is talking into) has some powers

81
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:46,610
I won’t be able to handle this. It would
be going here, there and there. So to worship

82
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:02,810
Mahalakshmi one has to remember that you must
dissolve all your powers. That is the surrender

83
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:11,690
that is what is ‘Islam‘ as they call it.
But these are all words for people.

84
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:18,480
Surrender is a very difficult thing to understand
for human beings. They think “I can’t

85
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:25,250
surrender.” What do you have to surrender,
is nothing but your ego and your conditioning.

86
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:31,230
All these things I am telling you but if you
learn them by heart like a parrot, you can

87
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:38,230
repeat. That will have no influence on your
followers. Unless and until you show in your

88
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:47,020
own life that beauty, that composer, that
care, that concern, that love, nobody is going

89
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:05,510
to listen to a parrot.
The meaning has to come from the practices

90
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:16,900
not from the precepts. This is what Sahaja
Yoga [is], which is very different from any

91
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:27,370
other spiritual announcements. So be careful!
You

92
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:17,190
have

93
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:38,680
been chosen by your merit as sahaja yogis,
so respect yourself.

94
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:59,590
May God bless you!
