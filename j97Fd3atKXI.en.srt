1
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:48,500
It’s a unique opportunity today
to do Vishnumaya Puja

2
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:54,125
because She entered into this
house, we have to worship Her.

3
00:17:57,999 --> 00:18:00,750
First we should know
who is Vishnumaya.

4
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:05,291
It’s very important to know
because in the Devi Mahatmyam

5
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:13,291
She is only described as
the Incarnation of the Goddess,

6
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:17,583
Vishnumaye di shabdita.
She is called as Vishnumaya.

7
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:23,083
But let’s see who is She, after
all, this Vishnumaya is who?

8
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:29,583
So Vishnumaya is the Kali,
we can say,

9
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:34,959
and is the daughter of Mahakali.
She came on this earth

10
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:39,250
and killed many, many devils
and many rakshasas

11
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:43,166
to save the saints from
their aggression

12
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,750
and She always acts
in that manner

13
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,750
to kill all the negativity
of the world.

14
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,291
She is very quick at it, I should
say, and She knows

15
00:18:54,542 --> 00:19:00,875
where is the negativity and She
tries to burn that negativity

16
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,083
as fast as possible.

17
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:11,709
Now the origin is like this
that this Vishnumaya

18
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:24,291
was the daughter of Mahakali who
was created by Mahakali Herself

19
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:31,583
to fight these demons but also
She was given special

20
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:41,375
weapons to do this work. But at the
time of Shri Krishna She was born

21
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:51,959
as the sister of Shri Krishna, and
instead of Shri Krishna being killed

22
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,792
by Her uncle, as you
know the story is,

23
00:19:56,291 --> 00:20:00,999
She was exchanged, She was
actually the daughter of Yeshoda,

24
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:06,542
exchanged for Shri Krishna.
And this girl, little girl

25
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,458
was killed by the uncle
of Shri Krishna,

26
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:17,709
who became the lightning in
the sky and announced that,

27
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:24,166
“Shri Krishna has already
incarnated, and your destiny

28
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:29,041
is in His hands and He is going
to kill you,” She told Kamsa.

29
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:34,375
So this is the Vishnumaya. Then
again She took Her birth

30
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:39,750
at the time of Shri Krishna
when He was,

31
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:51,166
he was the King of
Dwarika,

32
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:59,375
and She married, I should say,
these five Pandavas.

33
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:04,417
Because She was Draupadi.
There’s a significance in that,

34
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:11,959
that this is the one which
joins five elements.

35
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:16,083
And these five Pandavas
represented five elements

36
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:21,917
and so She joined them as
one wife because She’s the one

37
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:25,083
who joins all the
five elements

38
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:29,291
that have created this
material universe.

39
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:41,625
Thus, we have a relationship
established with Shri Krishna,

40
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:47,375
and Shri Krishna as you know
that, treated Her as a sister.

41
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:55,417
Now once when you know that
they tried to insult Draupadi

42
00:21:55,709 --> 00:22:00,959
by pulling out Her saris, it was
Shri Krishna who helped Her

43
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:04,750
because She was His sister
and such a powerful lady.

44
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:09,417
She’s also responsible
for the Mahabharata.

45
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:13,792
She’s the one who brought forth,
She’s the one who told that,

46
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,667
“You have to fight
these Pandavas.”

47
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:22,083
She absolutely told them very clearly
that, “You have to fight the Kauravas

48
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:26,375
and in such a way that they
should be defeated not only

49
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,709
but they should be
destroyed.”

50
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:32,333
Because the chastity of
woman is very important

51
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:38,083
and in India anybody who tries
to molest the chastity of woman

52
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,166
is to be cursed, is to
be destroyed.

53
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:46,083
And this was a very great
message of Mahabharata

54
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,166
that only because She
was insulted so much,

55
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:54,625
all the war took place and
all of them were destroyed.

56
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:03,083
So this is the story
of Vishnumaya,

57
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:06,750
but as all the Deities are
now in Adi Shakti residing,

58
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:11,834
She is on your left
Vishuddhi reflected.

59
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,208
And the left Vishuddhi
is very important

60
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:23,709
because we have
problems of our Ego.

61
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:29,458
And you really need
someone to remind us

62
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:35,667
that we should not have
this Ego to oppress others.

63
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:38,667
So this reminder comes to us
maybe from our conscience

64
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,875
or wherever it is, you may say, from
our upbringing, and settles down

65
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:47,875
in our left Vishuddhi
as the clouds of guilt.

66
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,999
Also, as you know, Catholic Church
and all these people,

67
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,917
every religion start saying
that, “You are a sinner”

68
00:23:55,083 --> 00:24:00,917
and all this settles down in the
left side of your Vishuddhi chakra.

69
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:06,000
So the guilt is there. Now the guilt
is there, then it is there,

70
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:11,792
She is sitting down. This guilt
when rubs against each other

71
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:15,625
as the clouds in the sky,

72
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:21,083
Vishnumaya gives you
a feeling of burning,

73
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:28,542
She burns the bhoots there, She
burns our guilt and also She removes

74
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,999
our doubts about ourself
with Her light.

75
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:36,208
But in the beginning in Sahaja Yoga,
as you’ve seen, when the Kundalini rises

76
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:37,917
when the Kundalini rises

77
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:42,125
you feel always the left side,
very clearly,

78
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:45,166
the pain or sometimes
the burning.

79
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:48,834
And sometimes people say,
“Mother, why am I feeling

80
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,291
such burning here when
the Kundalini is rising?”

81
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,999
Because is the Vishnumaya,
She’s trying to burn them out.

82
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:59,333
This is one of Her capacities,
to burn. Some of them,

83
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:03,999
like we can say, the water
element can dissolve,

84
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:09,500
then the ice can soothe
you down, but Vishnumaya

85
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:15,250
is an element like electricity,
which really puts you

86
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:24,792
into proper shape by burning
away your negativities.

87
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,542
Is very surprising that
this power of Vishnumaya

88
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:35,083
is of the left side and
despite that it has that fire

89
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,083
in itself that it can
burn away the,

90
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:44,333
I should say, the negativity
bhoots on the left hand side.

91
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:48,041
Now let us see how we develop
these left hand side bhoots,

92
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,792
it’s very interesting, because
as we are dealing

93
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:52,834
with Vishnumaya we should
co-operate with Her

94
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:56,458
and should not have any
more pains upon us.

95
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:59,999
It comes to us specially
in the West.

96
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:03,959
I mean in India I don’t
think anybody

97
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,667
feels guilty about anything. It’s
something that very surprising,

98
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:08,542
I’ve never seen any
Indian feeling guilty.

99
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:15,083
The reason is, that if they have
done a mistake, in India,you know,

100
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:20,834
the culture is such that "this is bad
manners, that is bad manners," like that.

101
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,875
Now if somebody by mistake

102
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:31,500
does something, then he can
bear a grunt against that person

103
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,750
but he’ll never feel guilty that,
“I’ve hurt that person,”

104
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,417
or “I’ve said something
wrong,”

105
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,000
or “I should not have
said that,”

106
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,750
because in the whole culture
there is nothing like “sorry”

107
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,500
and “thank you”. It’s funny
culture Indian is.

108
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,834
There’s nothing like
saying “sorry”

109
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,291
and so much “thank you”
also they don’t say.

110
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,041
And all the time saying,
“Thank you”, and “Good morning”,

111
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:59,291
“Good evening”, I mean all the time, it’s
more sort of a artificial thing for us.

112
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:02,500
Even in Maharashtra the women
never even say “Namaste”

113
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:08,583
except to the Goddess or to God or
to Incarnations, or in the temples.

114
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:13,083
They’ll never say to some man,
“Namaskar” like this - just like this

115
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:15,917
or they might just
smile, that’s all.

116
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:19,750
So it is because we have
to only bow to God.

117
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:22,834
Why should we say
“Good morning” to everyone,

118
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,291
“Good evening” to
everyone?

119
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,208
We should we say,
“Good morning” only to God.

120
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:32,083
You see that’s the situation,
it is the way it is being done.

121
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:36,458
Now if you have done anything
wrong, say in the East,

122
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:42,750
I mean in India, as it is - if you
have done anything in a way

123
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:48,999
that you should not have done.
So there are only two ways

124
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:53,000
they deal with it, either they will
confess it and go that person,

125
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,083
that “I have done this wrong,
now you can cut my throat,

126
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:57,417
do what you like. Whatever
punishment you give me

127
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:02,166
Whatever punishment you
give me I am willing to do."

128
00:28:02,792 --> 00:28:05,166
This is the first thing,
they’ll admit it,

129
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:08,250
that “If you think that
I have done wrong

130
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:10,500
you can slap me
immediately,

131
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,875
I can pick up the slap.”

132
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:17,041
Supposing you say something
rude to your father.

133
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:20,750
It’s not to be said,
is bad manners

134
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,083
because he is elder.

135
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:29,166
If any elderly person has been
insulted then it is wrong,

136
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:32,750
then you will go and touch the
feet of that person and say,

137
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:35,999
“I am sorry, I’ve said this and
I hope you forgive me.”

138
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:38,999
So the other person says
after that, “I forgive you.”

139
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:43,041
I’ll give an example.
We were in Russia

140
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,125
and a little problem started
between two persons.

141
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:51,959
One was much younger and one
was much older, Sahaja Yogis.

142
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:55,750
So the reaction I’m
telling you how it was.

143
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:08,417
So the elder one came and complained
at two o’clock in the night

144
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:11,542
that this man said that,

145
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,333
“You don’t know what
I’m capable of.”

146
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:18,667
I said, “Really. That’s, he should not
 have said such a thing to you.”

147
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:24,834
So I called that fellow,
woke him up at about 2:30.

148
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:28,667
I said, “Why did you say
such a thing to him?

149
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,291
You should not have
said. He is your elder,

150
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
you cannot say like that.”

151
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:40,750
“Because he said that, Mother, he talked
to me as if he would talk to his own servant.

152
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:44,750
He didn’t talk to me in the way
he should have talked to me,

153
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:47,166
so I said this.” But I said,
“Despite that

154
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:51,542
you cannot say this to your elders,
you cannot say like that.”

155
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,709
“Yes, of course, I know
I made a mistake

156
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:57,375
and actually I was not
sleeping, I was not awakened,

157
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:00,750
I was not sleeping, I was thinking
I should tomorrow morning go

158
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:04,417
and ask for his forgiveness
and finish it.” I said, “Just now.”

159
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:07,375
Immediately he got up and got
hold of his feet and he said,

160
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:11,333
“Now forgive me, because you
were also too much of it.”

161
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:13,500
He said, “I agree, that was
my mistake

162
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:16,625
so you also forgive me.
” Finished!

163
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:23,333
And in the West, formerly,
it was not so bad also.

164
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:27,250
What they used to do supposing
there’s a quarrel between two men,

165
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:31,625
they would use their boxing,
box each other nicely

166
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:34,583
and everybody will box
each other. Finished!

167
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:39,041
Nowadays you cannot
box anyone,

168
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,500
you cannot ask for forgiveness,
and it’s too much of prestige,

169
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:44,875
this, that, all these
artificial things

170
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:46,375
have made you feel
guilty

171
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:49,667
because you are supposed
to do that.

172
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:53,417
If anybody
- it’s natural –

173
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,834
if anybody has said
anything to you,

174
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:57,417
you’ll just go and
box him and say,

175
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,041
“Why did you say such
a thing to me?”

176
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,792
and that fellow will box
you back and finished.

177
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,083
Was a very common
style, you see

178
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:07,375
all these old American
pictures

179
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:11,333
you see all this, I’ve seen
it all the time.

180
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:36,709
But this guilt business has come
because of sophistication.

181
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:41,333
I used to think, “Why do they
feel guilty for everything?”

182
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:44,166
First is sophistication,
first reason is.

183
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,792
Because you cannot go
and say somebody,

184
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:50,125
“Oh I’m sorry I’ve said this
and please forgive me,”

185
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:53,834
and another person may
not even forgive.

186
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:58,333
This is due to sophistication
and no communication.

187
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:02,375
There’s no communication.
I mean in a country like India

188
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:07,667
people will fight and next thing
you’ll see them hugging each other.

189
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:12,999
It doesn’t last long, very
much. But if there is any,

190
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:16,500
sort of a very big problem
between the families

191
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:21,041
or someone something - an ancient
one then they’ll keep it up.

192
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:24,875
They will not talk to that person,
they’ll keep their distance,

193
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:27,917
they’ll keep it all the time.
But here it is not so.

194
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:31,041
Superficially they’ll
meet everyone.

195
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:33,999
Superficially they’ll
talk to everyone

196
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:36,792
but inside they
have that guilt.

197
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:40,125
So because of this superficial
sophistication

198
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:44,208
what has happened that we
suffer from this left Vishuddhi

199
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,208
and then Vishnumaya
gets angry.

200
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:48,959
That’s why most of the people
in the West, I have seen,

201
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,625
have left Vishuddhi
and even

202
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:56,583
I have got it from you
all. It’s like that.

203
00:32:56,834 --> 00:33:00,041
So it’s nothing, it’s artificial,
it is mythical,

204
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,917
nothing to feel guilty
about.

205
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,999
After all even if you have
done anything wrong

206
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:07,667
you would have been in jail.
You are sitting here,

207
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:09,959
so how can you
be guilty.

208
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:12,583
So this guilt business
has killed our growth

209
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:16,250
in Sahaja Yoga very much,
I know that. So first of all –

210
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:20,125
how to overcome your
ego is the problem.

211
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Ego is there and when you see
your ego and you cannot say

212
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:31,208
that you are egoistical, you have
to put the result of that

213
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:38,792
as a left Vishuddhi.
So the first thing

214
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:43,417
you have to do is to see
that you have ego.

215
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:46,375
All right, then you stand
before the mirror,

216
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:48,542
separate yourself from
your reflection

217
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,792
and start telling off your
own reflection,

218
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:53,667
“Now what do you mean by
having ego in yourself?

219
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:56,959
You are a Sahaja Yogi - you have
no business to have any ego.”

220
00:33:57,125 --> 00:34:01,583
But if you have the guilt you
will never see you have the ego.

221
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:05,333
You will just feel the guilt but
never see you have the ego.

222
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:10,333
And that’s how ego remains and
the left Vishuddhi also remains.

223
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,583
Both things can be
easily conquered

224
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:15,125
if you face yourself,
just see yourself.

225
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:19,166
“This was my ego? Yes.
Why should I have ego?”

226
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:24,083
Now there are ways of removing
all these imbalances

227
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:27,333
within ourselves through
Sahaja Yoga. It’s not difficult.

228
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:30,166
And has been removed.
So you know right side,

229
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:33,417
left side - it’s so simple. Sahaja
Yoga is just movement

230
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:36,959
of your fingers and hands,
that’s all.

231
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,917
It’s not a thing diagnosis,

232
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:42,166
where they take out your
blood, take out your tongue,

233
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:46,291
take out your eyes and
declare that you are healthy.

234
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,999
It’s not that way. It just,
you can feel it,

235
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,709
that you are all right,
you are in balance.

236
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:54,166
Once that balance
is established

237
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:57,750
there is no problem
with Vishnumaya.

238
00:34:57,959 --> 00:35:03,125
So this Vishnumaya who was
the sister of Shri Krishna

239
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:06,999
and later on came as Draupadi and
all that is today also existing

240
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:12,208
in this light, and in
your left Vishuddhi.

241
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:19,917
But people do not want to
see what’s wrong with them.

242
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:24,333
This is the big problem. Like in
York they had a church

243
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:28,083
where a bishop of Durham,
useless fellow,

244
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:31,709
he declared that Christ
was an ordinary man

245
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:34,250
and he could have been
a homosexual.

246
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:35,999
Can you imagine, such
a thing to say, I mean,

247
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:39,166
even to hear is too much!

248
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:42,875
And we should make
some experiments,

249
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:46,208
we should find out through
some discoveries.

250
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:48,166
Can you imagine such
a hopeless thing

251
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:50,959
he should say
in the church.

252
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:54,250
So when the whole thing
– the ceremony he said it,

253
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:02,166
then our Archbishop of Canterbury,
who is another one,

254
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:09,041
was so enamoured by the
new discovery of this fellow

255
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:13,041
that he honoured him
in a church in York.

256
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,208
And then after the thing
the whole working

257
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:20,333
was about to be over or
something they saw lightning

258
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:24,000
looming round the church,
around it.

259
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:26,959
When the all the people
were out

260
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:30,583
this lightning completely
fell on that thing

261
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:36,500
and destroyed the whole of the
church, except for the lower part.

262
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:42,041
Now instead of seeing that
what they did was wrong,

263
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:46,625
what they said that,
“See, look at the grace of God,

264
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:54,667
and the grace of our faith that the lower
portion of the church was not burned.”

265
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,625
Such an explanation
to be given!

266
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:01,625
So then explanation come.
I’ve seen is very common here,

267
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:05,583
because mind is very
intelligent here.

268
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:11,083
“I did this because I thought
like this, I thought like that.”

269
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:16,333
Always there is an explanation for
everything that you did wrong.

270
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:18,875
“I thought like this.” But
why did you think like that

271
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:22,375
is the point nobody
wants to hear.

272
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:26,250
If you think, “Why did
I think like that?”

273
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:35,041
So this is an escape from
the assertion of your ego

274
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,834
that has harmed others
or also it has harmed

275
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:42,625
some Gods. It’s just
an explanation,

276
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:46,041
and people wriggle out.

277
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,291
Actually there are
so many wrigglers

278
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,166
I have seen like Mr Waldheim,
they just wriggle out of all these –

279
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:57,166
all the problems
they have created,

280
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:59,458
all the bad things they
have done, I mean,

281
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:02,999
somehow or other they
know how to wriggle out.

282
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:05,333
Because this method they
have developed

283
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:09,291
is to just to say something
that would somehow

284
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:15,875
or other give them a little
capacity to escape.

285
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:19,500
But they don’t want
to face it.

286
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:23,166
So now, we have
to understand

287
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:26,125
that we must face it and
I know of Sahaja Yogis also,

288
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:30,333
say there are certain, whom you tell them now:
“What? Why it has happened?”

289
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:35,000
“I thought…”
But why did you think?

290
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:37,709
You should have
seen the vibrations.

291
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:39,750
You are not on
the thinking level,

292
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:41,709
you are now on
the vibration level.

293
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:43,959
Why not use your
vibratory awareness?

294
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:47,709
“I thought.” Once this “I thought”
comes in your attention

295
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:55,834
is on something that
is mythical.

296
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,333
The reality is that you
have committed a mistake,

297
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:01,959
all right admit it’s a mistake
and is to be corrected.

298
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:08,875
Now take a car, now there’s
a car. If the car gets out of order

299
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:13,041
or something, the car doesn’t
think, “I thought”, does it?

300
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:17,959
And we also don’t think that
the car thought, never.

301
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:21,500
What we do is to correct
the car, finished!

302
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:24,083
If we have to drive the
car we correct the car.

303
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:28,625
In the same way this mind
which says “I thought”

304
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:32,959
should on the contrary
correct itself.

305
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,166
So this sentence
of “I thought”

306
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:40,834
should be out of the
language of Sahaja Yogis.

307
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,458
So we don’t think, you know, we
are in thoughtless awareness.

308
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:49,625
And then things work out,
properly.

309
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:52,083
When you start
thinking that,

310
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,166
“I think I am responsible,”
finished.

311
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:02,291
When you start thinking,
“I am not responsible,

312
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,417
it’s all done by God, I’m not
responsible for anything,”

313
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:11,542
if some mistake is done
it’s God’s mistake,

314
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:14,667
let Him have this
left Vishuddhi.

315
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:17,667
But I haven’t done anything
wrong. But when I say

316
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:20,875
“I thought” means
I take the responsibility

317
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:24,417
and I create my own
problems.

318
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:28,500
So to take a decision
you should be

319
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:32,500
in that state of thoughtless
awareness.

320
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,875
Many times I see all these
things happening

321
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:37,917
like a drama around Me.
I keep quiet.

322
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:41,999
I say, “All right, all right, everyone
all right.” I take the consensus.

323
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:47,417
But whatever has to be done is
done according to God’s will.

324
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:52,333
But it doesn’t amazes
people now,

325
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:56,875
it used to once upon a time,
because it corrects people,

326
00:40:57,041 --> 00:41:00,999
it is fruitful, it achieves
results.

327
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:05,834
Ultimately now they
have accepted

328
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,083
that whatever Mother
decide is the best.

329
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,417
But I don’t decide, actually,
to be very frank

330
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:14,333
I don’t do anything. But I
see it so clearly,

331
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:17,291
so evidently that this is the
right thing one should do,

332
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:20,750
so why do wrong things?

333
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:23,625
That’s how you have to
develop yourself,

334
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:27,375
to get over this problem
of Vishuddhi.

335
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:30,166
But Vishnumaya has
to be worshipped,

336
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:32,583
has to be really remembered
every day,

337
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:37,250
because that is a common
failing in the west.

338
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:41,959
Now if your Vishnumaya is
bad, angry with you,

339
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:49,041
then what happens? You go on
adding guilt after guilt,

340
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:52,625
guilt after guilt, guilt after guilt.
But all the time if you are alert

341
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:57,834
and keep your Vishnumaya
intact then what happens?

342
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:06,333
That She looks after you, She doesn’t
allow any guilt to come in.

343
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:12,667
And then the enjoyment of
your Spirit is maximum.

344
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:17,875
With the guilt it’s a dent in it.
You see, you...

345
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:21,208
“Ah, I am so happy Mother, happy,
very happy I am rejoicing,”

346
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:25,709
but suddenly what happened?
“Oh, I did that wrong.”

347
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:29,166
I have seen people getting
upset for small things, I mean,

348
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,875
of course I have another life also,
a very sophisticated world.

349
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:34,166
One gentleman was eating
all right, and suddenly, “Uh!”

350
00:42:34,542 --> 00:42:38,500
“What happened?”

351
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:39,750
“Oh, I was supposed
to telephone

352
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:44,417
to that person and I did
not telephone.”

353
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:48,000
“But now you eat your food, now.
Why are you worried about that?”

354
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:50,083
“No, I should have.”

355
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:52,542
“But what is going to
happen in any case?

356
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,208
You have not telephoned so
you have not telephoned now.

357
00:42:55,417 --> 00:42:58,667
It’s all right, now you better have
your food and telephone.”

358
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:02,667
Then he finds out that the
man was not there at all,

359
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:08,375
he could never have got him.
So all these things are, sort of,

360
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:11,417
have created a kind of
a norms in our life

361
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,875
and these are so
artificial norms.

362
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:19,125
Now I was supposed to be
there, say at this time,

363
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:24,959
I am not there, so what?
I should have been there,

364
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:29,625
but if you are not there what’s
the use of feeling bad about it?

365
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,917
I should have reached the place.
You’ll be surprised,

366
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:35,208
the planes will wait,
the man will wait,

367
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:41,417
everything will be there even
if you reach eight hours later.

368
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:43,959
It would all happen
that way.

369
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:48,041
But first you must get in tune
with this All-Pervading Power,

370
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:52,999
with Vishnumaya. If you are
tuned with that,

371
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:54,542
attuned with Her then
you will never find,

372
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:59,250
it’s all in front of you.
It’s just there

373
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:03,166
because remember now you have
entered into the Kingdom of God,

374
00:44:03,417 --> 00:44:07,542
just test it. But on the contrary
you are all the time

375
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:13,041
using your human ignorance,
and then you get deceived.

376
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,667
Try to know that you
are enlightened people,

377
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:18,834
that you are not
any more ordinary.

378
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:24,000
But unless and until you use
your powers what’s the use?

379
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:28,999
It’s like some beggar - you
put him on the throne.

380
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:33,458
And when people come to Me,
begs, whatever - all right.

381
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:37,667
You are made the king,
why are you begging?

382
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:46,625
So not to feel guilty
is our religion.

383
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:49,999
Not to feel guilty.
We have to face it.

384
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:51,792
If we have done
any mistake

385
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:53,959
with open heart we should accept
we’ve done this mistake,

386
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:57,417
go and tell the person,
do the thing or correct it,

387
00:44:57,625 --> 00:45:01,000
or attend to it, instead of
making a capital out of it

388
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:04,333
and putting it down
on your Vishuddhi.

389
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:08,583
It is a very big problem in the West
and I was surprised

390
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:11,917
that it is very much on the increase
and they are very proud,

391
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:16,709
“Oh, I’m so guilty!”
Better go to jail.

392
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:24,583
All your pleasant temperament,
all your joyous temperament

393
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:29,542
absolutely gets poisoned
by this guilt

394
00:45:29,792 --> 00:45:34,709
which has no meaning.
Neither it can help you

395
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:40,667
nor can it help anyone. I’m telling
you with such earnestness,

396
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:44,208
because I know it’s a, in the
beginning of course,

397
00:45:44,417 --> 00:45:47,291
all the Sahaja Yogis whom
I’ve met in the West

398
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:52,083
had this guilt. Also Catholicism is
another one.

399
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,333
In the Catholic Church you are
supposed to confess.

400
00:45:54,542 --> 00:45:58,417
But I have seen Protestants
very badly guilty.

401
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,709
Protestants are no less.
But in India

402
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:06,458
you take any Catholic or a Protestant
- nobody is guilty there.

403
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:10,834
As I told you the other day a story
My granddaughter asked Me,

404
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:13,999
“Grandma, what sins You
think I am committing?”

405
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:17,208
I said, “What?” “I didn’t
commit any sin,

406
00:46:17,417 --> 00:46:19,917
but can You tell me if I am
committing any sin?”

407
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:22,750
I said, “I don’t see
any sin in you.”

408
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:25,917
She said, “But You know in
our school they asked me

409
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:29,875
to confess my sins – so
what should I confess?”

410
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:32,500
I said,
“What will you say?”

411
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,750
“Oh, only thing
I ate two ice-creams.”

412
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,999
So I said,
“Go and tell them.”

413
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:44,959
So it’s so stupid
as that.

414
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:48,291
If you see the point
it is very stupid

415
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:51,250
and this stupidity you should,
Sahaja Yogis should not engulf.

416
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:54,291
Keep yourself happy, makes
no difference whatsoever.

417
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:57,166
And sometimes I make
mistakes, like suddenly,

418
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:01,250
I don’t know why, Aristotle
I confused with Tolstoy.

419
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:03,625
I don’t know why, Tolstoy
came into My mind,

420
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:07,166
though I don’t think Tolstoy
was anywhere near Aristotle

421
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:09,542
or Aristotle was
any near like that.

422
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:12,417
But I did commit mistake
and I’ve been thinking,

423
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:14,709
“Why, why it was so?”

424
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:19,999
Still it is very important.

425
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:25,500
Even these people, you see,
when they are described

426
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:30,250
like - you see Aristotle had no
influence on Tolstoy at all,

427
00:47:30,542 --> 00:47:32,542
is a fact. He had
no influence.

428
00:47:32,792 --> 00:47:35,166
Aristotle was
a man with politics

429
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:38,250
and all that and he displaced
all the philosophy on one side.

430
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:41,250
Here is Tolstoy who
tried to show

431
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,875
how a person can
resurrect.

432
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:47,500
I don’t know if you
have read him or not,

433
00:47:47,709 --> 00:47:51,750
but I think he is one of the great
writers of those days.

434
00:47:51,959 --> 00:47:55,834
And the other day only I was
comparing both of them and I said,

435
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,875
“Look at this man, he is absolutely
different from Aristotle,

436
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:05,375
absolutely, two ends of
the thing we can say,

437
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:09,125
and how is it that
he never read Aristotle?

438
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:15,625
He was such a learned man,
he never read Aristotle.”

439
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:20,208
Then I just felt it’s
a Russian mind,

440
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:23,625
and Russian mind is
extremely introspective

441
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:28,166
and this introspection
was missing in Mr Aristotle,

442
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:32,250
was taking out everything out of
his head, the yarn, and putting people

443
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:37,875
on the other line
altogether of this politics.

444
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:40,583
Plato was even in
a way worse than him,

445
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:45,291
but this one is another.
So Socrates was finished

446
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:48,792
and Aristotle
became everything.

447
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:54,834
But because I have been judging
both of them on their merits –

448
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:56,583
then how is it Tolstoy?

449
00:48:56,834 --> 00:49:00,375
Because Tolstoy was
a born realised soul.

450
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:05,875
So he saw life very
differently.

451
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:08,999
If you have read Anna Karenina
there they have shown this lady,

452
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:11,166
Anna Karenina, carrying
on with another man,

453
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:14,500
when she was a married lady
and her husband very tolerant,

454
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:16,583
working very hard
and all that

455
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:18,500
and could not give her sufficient
time so she thought

456
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,417
she has a right
to be romantic.

457
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:25,834
And then at the end he proves
that she was never happy.

458
00:49:27,291 --> 00:49:32,166
But her husband was very
peaceful, very forgiving,

459
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:35,542
but she was never happy and
ultimately she had to commit suicide.

460
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,500
I mean these are
old writers,

461
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,999
used to write like this - specially
those who were realised souls.

462
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,417
But if you give the same
thing to somebody

463
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:46,834
who is a modern writer
he would show

464
00:49:46,999 --> 00:49:49,875
that the husband committed
suicide, not the wife.

465
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:53,750
And that’s what now we
are in the modern times

466
00:49:53,959 --> 00:50:00,500
and that’s how we are, that we
feel guilty for none of our faults.

467
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:04,125
Here is a wife carrying
on with another man

468
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:08,542
and the man feels that I am guilty
because I am not so attractive

469
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:13,875
that’s why she’s carrying on with
another man and he commits suicide.

470
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:20,208
It’s not so. It is the wife who
is wrong - not the man.

471
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:24,250
So also there is a shift
of guilt or wrong

472
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:29,583
from one to another by our
perverted thinking.

473
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:32,792
I have seen some men who
are just like cabbages

474
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:36,041
before their wives
- specially in America.

475
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:40,375
Just cabbages! I said,
“Why are you such a cabbage?”

476
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:42,750
So they say, “Mother,
You see it was our guilt –

477
00:50:42,959 --> 00:50:44,375
the way we suppressed
women.”

478
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:48,875
“But why do you allow your women
to suppress you? That’s also wrong.”

479
00:50:49,834 --> 00:50:52,083
So they allow their
women to suppress them

480
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:55,417
because they think their forefathers
suppressed the women.

481
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:59,208
I mean, doing the same thing,
I mean, you are imbalancing yourself.

482
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:03,041
Because you feel guilty.
For whom? For your forefathers.

483
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:06,083
I mean they are dead
and gone - you are different.

484
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:09,208
Like that we try to make
ourselves guilty,

485
00:51:09,417 --> 00:51:12,709
it’s a fashion, you know, like
dressing up in a funny way.

486
00:51:12,917 --> 00:51:15,959
All the time try to find
out what wrong

487
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:19,999
we have done is
a typical Western mind.

488
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:23,834
And then you become
Les Miserables.

489
00:51:23,999 --> 00:51:26,999
How can you be
happy people?

490
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:30,959
All the time you start blaming
yourself, putting yourself down.

491
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:35,041
All these theories and all those
things that have come to you

492
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:38,083
have just made
you miserable people,

493
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:42,208
without going to jail you
are in jail.

494
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:45,083
Now this I was telling you
about the dresses.

495
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:50,792
There’s a six inches
skirts have come.

496
00:51:50,999 --> 00:51:55,542
Now girls feel guilty if they don’t wear six inches.

497
00:51:56,834 --> 00:51:59,041
So actually it is
wrong to wear that –

498
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,709
but they feel guilty that
they are not wearing.

499
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:04,709
Because these are funny
norms we have created

500
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:08,875
that whatever the entrepreneurs take
out we should be slaves to them.

501
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:12,041
Immediately we should start
throwing away all our clothes,

502
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,083
take new style, another style.
It is in Paris

503
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:18,625
something comes up
everybody should wear.

504
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:22,000
On the contrary if India
anybody starts such tricks,

505
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:27,417
we’ll never accept. “Get lost!
We don’t want all this nonsense.”

506
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:32,500
So by that we throw away
all the tradition

507
00:52:32,709 --> 00:52:35,750
which has grown us
to this level.

508
00:52:35,959 --> 00:52:39,333
All our traditions
we lose –

509
00:52:39,709 --> 00:52:42,208
because these entrepreneurs
are working on us,

510
00:52:42,417 --> 00:52:44,834
we are playing into their
hands and all these people

511
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:46,917
are putting their yarns
every day,

512
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:49,625
all kinds of theories
coming up from all over,

513
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:54,500
we start accepting. If we do not
accept we feel guilty.

514
00:52:54,834 --> 00:52:59,417
It’s very surprising how
people accept nonsense.

515
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:04,750
There’s a very painful
experience of Mine

516
00:53:04,999 --> 00:53:10,000
when I went to America
once and there was

517
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:13,208
a little child of eight years
and she said, “He takes drugs,”

518
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:15,917
the mother. I said, “Really?”
I felt so shocked

519
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:18,583
I just took the child
to My Heart and I said,

520
00:53:18,834 --> 00:53:21,875
“Why do you take drugs?”
He looked up at Me.

521
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:24,834
He said, “My mother never
hugs me like this.”

522
00:53:25,041 --> 00:53:27,959
I asked her, “Why don’t you
hug your child like that?”

523
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:30,458
She said, “Because
I’ll develop a guilt.”

524
00:53:30,709 --> 00:53:31,959
I said, “How?”

525
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,166
“According to Freud
it would be a guilt.”

526
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:39,083
Now Freud is dictating that
it’s a guilt to hug your child,

527
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:41,166
so you develop a guilt.

528
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:43,834
So from where is it coming
this guilt to you?

529
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,875
It’s from these books
that you are reading,

530
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:48,250
these useless people
who are guiding you,

531
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,917
they have no character,
they have no sense,

532
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:52,583
they have no idea
of reality

533
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:54,792
and that’s what
you accept as Bible,

534
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,917
then naturally you will be
guilty.

535
00:54:00,417 --> 00:54:04,417
If a little coffee spills in a party,
“Oh My God!”

536
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:07,667
then I think you are worse
than a criminal.

537
00:54:07,917 --> 00:54:10,667
Or if somebody’s carpet is
spoiled then of course,

538
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:14,291
I mean, you should go
to jail immediately.

539
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:21,166
More on very superficial things
these norms are made,

540
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:25,583
on very superficial behaviours
these norms are made

541
00:54:25,792 --> 00:54:29,834
and then you start feeling
guilty. You don’t feel guilty

542
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:32,709
that you are a racist,
you don’t feel guilty

543
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:36,625
about the things about
which you have to feel guilty.

544
00:54:36,999 --> 00:54:40,125
That you aggress people
- in America killed thousands

545
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:42,583
and thousands of people,
millions of people there,

546
00:54:42,792 --> 00:54:44,875
nobody feels guilty
about that.

547
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:47,792
Or you dominated
the whole world –

548
00:54:47,999 --> 00:54:52,333
nobody feels guilty about that.
You feel guilty about things

549
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:56,583
which are extremely
superficial.

550
00:54:57,291 --> 00:54:59,875
But for Sahaja Yogis,
they are so deep,

551
00:55:00,834 --> 00:55:06,375
so deep that if they have to feel
really bad about anything it is,

552
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:11,500
I have to find out now what
they have to feel bad.

553
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:20,250
I have found a simple
solution,if you feel bad

554
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:23,667
please pull your ears,
finished!

555
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:25,834
Or if you feel guilty
just pull your ears

556
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,500
and the Vishuddhi will be all right.
It’s a very simple method

557
00:55:28,709 --> 00:55:31,458
just pull your ears like this,
finished! But sometimes

558
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:33,500
I find people all the time

559
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:37,125
walking before me like this,

560
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:41,917
then I think what have
I done to them?

561
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:46,834
Even while dancing
they’ll do the same.

562
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:52,291
This is bit too much for Me to see
these people feeling,

563
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,166
so I mean, in Sahaja Yoga

564
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:56,500
is not such a hard and fast
rule about anything.

565
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:59,041
I mean you are absolutely
free people

566
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:02,333
and you have to use
all the freedom, absolutely.

567
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:05,500
You are not to sort of be
guided by some hard

568
00:56:05,709 --> 00:56:09,834
and fast rule that all the time you
keep your ears pulled down like that.

569
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,542
Just to overcome this nonsense
of your guilt I said,

570
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,542
“All right you can
pull your ears.”

571
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:18,250
And every time I see people
just pulling their ears.

572
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,959
Yesterday a girl was
wearing a big earings

573
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:23,500
and she was pulling her
earrings, you see,

574
00:56:23,709 --> 00:56:27,875
I was quite worried
it might…

575
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:31,750
Sahaja Yoga is just a play,

576
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:36,417
just an enjoyment it is not this
kind of hard and fast laws

577
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:42,834
and regulations as you see. Because
you are now innately religious,

578
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:45,542
you’ve got your Spirit
to see.

579
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,458
What mistakes can
you commit?

580
00:56:48,667 --> 00:56:50,834
But where you have to be
careful you are not.

581
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,750
For example, I say that
before going out

582
00:56:54,959 --> 00:56:58,125
please take a bandhan. It’s a kavach,
we call it a kavach.

583
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:02,834
Means, kavach - in English there’s
a word for that?

584
00:57:06,709 --> 00:57:09,375
That’s rather, protection
is abstract,

585
00:57:09,583 --> 00:57:13,750
but this is a protection of the Mother
is a concrete stuff,

586
00:57:13,999 --> 00:57:16,583
you see, kavach. So you
take the kavach.

587
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:20,083
Kavach is something you
can say that people

588
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:26,542
wear those armour, inside, you see
that sort of a thing, is kavach.

589
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:29,458
So you must take that
before going out

590
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:33,041
or talking to somebody.
That you don’t do.

591
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,041
Then I find there are,
I said,

592
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:37,583
“From where are you coming?”
“Oh Mother,

593
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:41,750
I went to see my,
I went to a cemetery.”

594
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,458
I said, “For what?”
“Somebody died so I went there.”

595
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:47,709
“So did you take your kavach?”
“No.”

596
00:57:47,999 --> 00:57:52,208
And you can see all the bhoots
dancing here on the head.

597
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:55,959
This is the thing is that –

598
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:59,709
and then you pull your
ears, what’s the use?

599
00:57:59,917 --> 00:58:04,208
It’s just a simple thing, take your
kavach when you are going out.

600
00:58:04,417 --> 00:58:06,500
It’s so simple, I mean,
in Sahaja Yoga

601
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,667
we don’t have to do horrible
rituals that people do,

602
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:13,333
nothing of the kind. Just take
your bandhan in the morning

603
00:58:13,542 --> 00:58:16,709
when you are going out and if
somebody is argumentative

604
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:19,999
just give a bandhan.
Anything little bandhan

605
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:22,792
can work out so many
things but we forget

606
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,250
that we have entered into
the Kingdom of God

607
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:30,333
and all the Saints and
all the angels

608
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:33,875
and Ganas are at
your disposal.

609
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:36,291
Now you have to believe
in yourself.

610
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:40,375
How am I to tell you that
believe in yourself now?

611
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,959
So this human nonsense
of feeling guilty

612
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:46,709
should vanish from every
Sahaja Yogi.

613
00:58:46,917 --> 00:58:51,166
That’s why today we are
having this Vishnumaya.

614
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:56,291
Now you see - for example the Vishnumaya
entered into this house,

615
00:58:56,542 --> 00:58:59,041
because it’s a new,
dilapidated, old house

616
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:03,959
and it was a brewery. It was wrong
to have the Havan outside

617
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:07,000
they should have had it inside.
Not to feel guilty about it,

618
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:14,333
but again, I think they will also.
So, but this was wrong.

619
00:59:14,542 --> 00:59:16,875
So Vishnumaya saw that you
had committed a mistake

620
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:20,125
She Herself came and
cleaned out everything.

621
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:22,583
She didn’t think that you should
feel guilty, She thought,

622
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:25,500
“These are children, still don’t know
anything about it,

623
00:59:25,709 --> 00:59:26,999
they don’t know how many
bhoots are inside.

624
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:30,917
Better I go and do the job.”
And She cleansed it.

625
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:33,834
That’s all, there’s nothing
to feel guilty about it.

626
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,999
She knows better than you,
naturally, so She’s done the job.

627
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:49,250
So - a Sahaja Yogi is not like a
- person

628
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:53,750
who looks as if somebody
has died in his family.

629
00:59:53,999 --> 00:59:56,542
See like a very serious,
he can’t smile,

630
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,999
even if you tickle he
won’t smile, you see,

631
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:01,959
so much above everything, that sort
of a person he is not.

632
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:06,583
He’s always bubbling with
enjoyment and love

633
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:10,625
and understanding and friendship.
Everything he enjoys,

634
01:00:10,834 --> 01:00:18,125
that’s what he’s a Sahaja Yogi.
If you ever feel guilty,

635
01:00:18,375 --> 01:00:20,000
now of course better
pull your ears,

636
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:23,750
that’s I would not cancel, because then
it might be much more there.

637
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:25,417
But ever feel guilty
you said,

638
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:27,625
“Why I’m feeling guilty?”
Just introspect.

639
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:31,375
And this is the difference
between Aristotle and Tolstoy,

640
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:33,333
and yesterday
I just realised

641
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:37,834
that why I thought of Tolstoy
instead of Aristotle.

642
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:42,917
Now our Vishnumaya principle is
to be always kept very alert

643
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:45,458
because it helps us in many ways.
First of all

644
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:52,667
it helps us to pass the messages
from your heart to your head.

645
01:00:52,959 --> 01:00:56,834
It is the one by which we
integrate. Our heart and head

646
01:00:56,999 --> 01:01:01,208
is integrated by the
Vishnumaya principle

647
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:08,333
more than the Vishuddhi
on the right side.

648
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:12,959
Vishuddhi on the right side
can create collectivity,

649
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:15,375
can create understanding
with each other

650
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:20,834
but on the left side it helps you
to keep a complete integration

651
01:01:21,792 --> 01:01:26,667
between your heart
and your head.

652
01:01:28,417 --> 01:01:32,125
If there is a guilt you just
think of it and analyse it.

653
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:38,250
It means that there’s a struggle between
you in your heart and your mind,

654
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,458
isn’t it? Simple as that.

655
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:46,542
If it was integrated you
would not feel guilty.

656
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:51,375
And that is why all these artificial
theories that have come,

657
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:54,875
all these artificial yarns
that you have read

658
01:01:55,041 --> 01:02:00,792
and all that, you forget it.
You are a Sahaja Yogi

659
01:02:00,999 --> 01:02:06,500
and you have entered into
the Kingdom of God - enjoy!

660
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:09,875
That’s all you have to do.
But you have to get

661
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:12,750
to that state of enjoyment
and understanding

662
01:02:12,959 --> 01:02:15,999
that you are above all.
Even you can’t say

663
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:20,417
that you should not be like
Buddha who’s sitting silently.

664
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:23,834
Nothing of the kind.
Buddha was sitting silently

665
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,999
only when he was
doing meditation.

666
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:29,625
Otherwise you have seen the
fat Buddha with all the children

667
01:02:29,834 --> 01:02:31,999
and laughing Buddha.

668
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:36,041
That means Ego must
laugh at itself.

669
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:39,999
That’s how this filth of this
guilt won’t be there.

670
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:42,999
Just laugh at yourself.
How I did like this.

671
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:46,834
Laughing at yourself is a very good
way of understanding yourself.

672
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,625
Try to find out what nonsense
I do. How I behave.

673
01:02:52,834 --> 01:02:57,917
Like there’s a lady, she always feels
responsible for everything, know?

674
01:02:58,083 --> 01:03:00,250
I call her Ghivdhari,
means the one

675
01:03:00,458 --> 01:03:05,792
who held the mountain
Govardhan in his hand.like that.

676
01:03:05,999 --> 01:03:07,917
She thinks she’s responsible
for everything.

677
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:11,750
And I try to outwit her in
all her responsibilities,

678
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:14,667
just to make her understand that
she’s not responsible.

679
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,917
And when she feels
she’s responsible

680
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:22,417
she’s all the time accumulating
this guilt in her.

681
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:25,333
Because firstly she’s
not responsible

682
01:03:25,542 --> 01:03:31,125
and secondly being
responsible she’s definitely

683
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:34,458
going to commit some
sort of mistakes and then

684
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:39,333
she’s going to take the
responsibility of the mistakes

685
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,709
and feel guilty. Then Vishnumaya
gets angry

686
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:46,792
and if She gets angry then you’ll
have problem of the left side.

687
01:03:47,667 --> 01:03:53,834
And left side is so important
that it doesn’t show,

688
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
it doesn’t express itself
but it is painful to you.

689
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:02,083
Left side is your own,
it is painful to you,

690
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:04,667
is troublesome to you. If there
is ego others are troubled

691
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:07,625
but if there is left
side you feel bad.

692
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:10,083
So don’t feel bad for
anything, I mean,

693
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,583
some people feel bad because
they were late for Puja,

694
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:14,875
doesn’t matter. That’s the time
you had to come.

695
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:17,999
Some people feel that they couldn’t
bring something for Puja,

696
01:04:18,166 --> 01:04:20,917
doesn’t matter. I never say,
“You didn’t bring this,

697
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:24,999
you didn’t do that.” I have never
said anything about the Puja,

698
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:27,917
never - even once. That you
did this wrong,

699
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:30,792
or you should not have
done this wrong,

700
01:04:30,999 --> 01:04:33,125
should have got it. Gradually
you all have learned.

701
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:34,792
What was the need
to tell you

702
01:04:34,999 --> 01:04:37,583
otherwise there would have
been another big well

703
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:40,667
of this guilt in your heads.
So you have to learn,

704
01:04:40,834 --> 01:04:43,125
you have never known pujas
before, you don’t know

705
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:45,959
what puja means, you don’t know
anything of that kind,

706
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:51,333
how it helps you. So, whatever
was done, you are growing,

707
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:54,333
after all children when they are
growing they’ll do mistakes.

708
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:58,999
Only My job is to protect you
and that I am doing.

709
01:04:59,417 --> 01:05:03,375
But now don’t try to destroy
yourself by feeling guilty.

710
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:07,125
That’s why we are today doing
the Puja of Vishnumaya.

711
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:11,792
She is Kali who is
the sister of Shri Krishna

712
01:05:11,999 --> 01:05:16,291
and who was Draupadi.
Who is the one

713
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:21,208
who is all the time for our
protection and for telling us

714
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,959
that we should not
feel guilty at all

715
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:26,917
and enjoy life.

716
01:05:28,041 --> 01:05:30,667
May God Bless you!
