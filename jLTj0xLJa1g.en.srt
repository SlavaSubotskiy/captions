1
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,873
It was really a wonderful idea

2
00:00:11,074 --> 00:00:17,211
to put My attention to all these fields
of life, which are very important

3
00:00:17,412 --> 00:00:25,892
and, as it is, I have attention on the all
of them, and I care for all that.

4
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:31,652
But I would say now you all people 
put in your attention to it,

5
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:37,091
because it is you who can do 
something about it.

6
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:39,872
You can start with the nature, 
as they said, is this:

7
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:42,571
we have to be kind to the nature.

8
00:00:42,652 --> 00:00:45,624
We are having such problems - people
are cutting out trees,

9
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:49,972
doing all these kinds of things, without
even thinking

10
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:55,268
that this is for the progeny will become
a desert.

11
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:02,689
So in the same way for everything,
for your fruits and agriculture,

12
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,491
vibrations can really change. We had
in our garden, you won't believe,

13
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:14,282
a peony flower just like this, even bigger
then this, very bigger.

14
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:22,559
We have never seen such a flower.
We had also the tulips so big as that.

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,412
I haven't seen such tulips in My lifetime.

16
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:28,652
With vibrations you can improve everywhere.

17
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:35,136
Say you go and see some politician,
let's say, or some political party,

18
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:39,492
then you use your hands and give them
bandhans all the time.

19
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:42,621
You can sit on the table across

20
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:47,181
and under the table you go on giving
them bandhan.

21
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:54,252
You have powers, but if you don’t use
your powers, then it is useless –

22
00:01:54,453 --> 00:01:57,637
if you just go on thinking about building
up yourself

23
00:01:57,838 --> 00:02:01,533
and looking after yourself - now those days
are gone.

24
00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:04,800
Now you have to look after other things,
and I was very much happy

25
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:09,010
with all the things that they have shown
and all My attention is already there.

26
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,391
But if you people also put your attention…

27
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:16,293
As you know I have already purchased
seven big, big lands,

28
00:02:16,494 --> 00:02:19,772
about fifty to sixty acres of lands
in Maharashtra

29
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:23,251
for different projects and these projects
have started.

30
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:26,993
Now in Delhi also we have a very huge,
big plan

31
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:31,292
to put the women who are destitutes.

32
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:34,811
First, on the social level we have to do
something, I thought.

33
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:38,735
So it’s all done, now we have started a
school, we have started a academy again –

34
00:02:38,936 --> 00:02:41,231
we are going to have another academy.

35
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:46,989
And also teaching young people with
vocational knowledge and all that.

36
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,491
India has, that way, is not so progressed
as you people are in these things.

37
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:56,290
But there’s one thing very great about
India is that –

38
00:02:56,491 --> 00:03:03,778
because of our culture maybe, because
of our Indian style of life of respect,

39
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:10,189
people have become very well equipped for
the software; you see, this kind of thing.

40
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,771
They are very intelligent in software,
because their attention penetrates.

41
00:03:14,972 --> 00:03:18,051
So if you also penetrate your attention,

42
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:21,384
I mean, you can achieve the same.
You are higher than them.

43
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:24,625
But because they have been brought up
in that culture,

44
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:32,084
they are very intelligent, but their
attention is not spread out, no.

45
00:03:32,285 --> 00:03:36,473
It is not. It is just on one point and they
penetrate very well.

46
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,612
And they are doing so well now that
a day will come

47
00:03:39,812 --> 00:03:42,851
when India will become one of the most
prosperous country.

48
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:45,350
So this is what has to happen,

49
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:49,032
that, firstly, the our culture has to be
brought round

50
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:54,211
to such a state that the children get
all the positive ideas

51
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:58,812
and a good character and proper building:
with love, affection.

52
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:01,455
But not to spoil them. Not to spoil them.

53
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:05,288
They should be brought up in such
a manner, that they develop

54
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:12,613
a proper view of the whole thing and also
they have penetration of their attention.

55
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:17,481
But if you go on changing your attention
all the time, the inside is finished,

56
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:23,371
I mean, because you see attention gets –
what you call it - broken.

57
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:27,411
So this penetration of attention has to be
seen.

58
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:35,132
Is, say, for example, you look at some
tree: then just watch it with love.

59
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:38,031
See what the tree is talking to you,
what is she saying?

60
00:04:38,232 --> 00:04:42,292
You’re just looking at a mountain -
then just talk to the mountain,

61
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,994
and see what the mountain is saying to you.

62
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:50,937
Put your attention in, completely on one
thing and see for yourself,

63
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:54,892
that will help you a lot. But if you have
an attention

64
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:58,772
which is all the time watching this,
watching that, this, that -

65
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:04,072
and criticising is another way you miss out
on attention.

66
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:08,492
Lots of attention goes to this. Thirdly:
could be the,

67
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:11,722
as I said, is self-importance; is the worst
thing.

68
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:14,371
In that, then, you do not think anything
is important,

69
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:21,215
you just go on looking after your self-
importance. There's so many ways,

70
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:28,302
but the best way is to learn how to handle
your own attention,

71
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:32,651
and how to handle other people.
That’s very important.

72
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:37,052
How you deal with people is very important
for a sahaja yogi.

73
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:42,052
You see, if you deal in a proper way,
in a decent manner,

74
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:47,612
in a way that’s congenial, that’s
appreciative,

75
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:51,876
then you will find so many friends, and
they will try to find out

76
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:56,972
how are you like this, how are you so
peaceful, how are you so kind,

77
00:05:57,172 --> 00:05:59,857
why are you not agitated like others are.

78
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:03,579
So in your own lifestyle you can establish
it.

79
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,331
But when you are dealing with others,
what I am saying,

80
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:10,507
that the social relations with others
is very important.

81
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,299
Now, at what level you should start
I can’t say.

82
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,117
Depends on your temperament and aptitude.

83
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:20,852
But whichever of these areas that you think
is important,

84
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:24,371
you can just try to find out what is
the solution,

85
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:30,091
how can you help it here, how can you
work it out. All of you can do it.

86
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:37,131
It is not that you have to develop a kind
of a party to fight anything.

87
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:42,867
But to have your own attention, you will
know the solutions of many problems.

88
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:47,475
Many problems can be solved if you
find out the solution.

89
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:51,328
But a solution you can find with your
concentration of mind.

90
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:56,052
That is very important. And if you can
really do that,

91
00:06:56,252 --> 00:07:01,529
all these problems that you face today,
in those different fields of life,

92
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,183
can be easily solved. It’s not so
difficult.

93
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:09,856
Family life as you said can be solved,
depending on the wife

94
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:16,403
and depending on the husband and their
relationship. Is very simple it is.

95
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:19,791
But somehow or other our background is
such, I think,

96
00:07:19,992 --> 00:07:25,572
that we don’t understand simple things.
We only understand complicated things.

97
00:07:25,772 --> 00:07:31,851
In a simple way, if you deal with people
at different levels

98
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:38,165
in these different aspects of life,
you’ll be amazed

99
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:44,368
you will be very much popular, people will
want to know what sort of a thing it is.

100
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:47,368
I’ll tell you one gentleman. His name was
Mr. Dhumal.

101
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:49,485
He is no more. They know him.

102
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:52,697
He was in the village, he was used to –
he was looking after

103
00:07:52,898 --> 00:08:00,132
his fields and things, he was like
a farmer.

104
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:03,492
And somehow he got realization in Poona.

105
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:07,345
After getting realization in Poona he went
to his own place

106
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:09,900
and he started Sahaja Yoga there.

107
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:14,955
And he started giving them realization,
this and that.

108
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:21,053
And it was surprising, because he never
came, as such, to Me,

109
00:08:21,254 --> 00:08:26,642
or he never came to Poona - and suddenly
he developed that, you see,

110
00:08:26,843 --> 00:08:29,773
mind of concentration.

111
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:34,331
And the people told Me, “Mother, he’s got
so many sahaja yogis”.

112
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:38,970
He has developed it with such
understanding,

113
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:41,246
and when I went there, I was surprised

114
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:45,083
that we had more sahaja yogis there
than we had in Poona!

115
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:48,508
When in Poona there were sahaja yogis
who were doing the work,

116
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:52,831
but this one single fellow had changed
the whole idea

117
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:57,215
of people in Ahmadnagar and Rahuri.

118
00:08:57,416 --> 00:09:02,959
Very surprising it was, that I mean, he was
just a simple man and a farmer type,

119
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:08,567
and then he started using vibrations
for his activities and things.

120
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:11,307
And it was so remarkable,

121
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:15,375
that actually he was, as I said, not very
educated and all that,

122
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:18,107
but we always went and stayed in his house,

123
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,424
and we were really enamoured by the way

124
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,851
he tried to express his spirituality
to others.

125
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:27,889
In the same way all of you can do it.
