1
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:19,410
I bow to all the seekers of truth. When Bala
says that I can give you realization in a

2
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,830
split of a second I have to tell you that
it is you who get it. You are built in that

3
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,480
way like a seed; when you put it in the Mother
Earth it sprouts. Whom will you give the credit

4
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,480
-- the seed or the Mother Earth? Without the
Mother Earth the seed cannot sprout and it

5
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:02,590
does not mean that if you put a stone in the
Mother Earth it will sprout.

6
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:09,649
So the credit is not to anyone but it is a
process which is built within us through ages

7
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:17,099
of our seeking. We have been seekers in previous
lives and before that we have been seeking.

8
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:22,580
Even when we were amoeba we were seeking.
That's how we have become a human being. And

9
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:28,160
now we have reached a stage where we are human
beings and we are seekers of truth. This is

10
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:35,160
the epitome of the highest that any human
being can reach where he is seeking.

11
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:43,500
As a human being when we are born we are quite
aware that we are higher than animals, that

12
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:52,119
we have capacities much more than animals
have. We are quite aware of our being as a

13
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,200
human being but this awareness that we have
is still not complete because we are still

14
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,520
in confusion. We do not know why we are on
this earth. We do not know what we have to

15
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:19,830
achieve. We do not know what mistakes we are
committing or this is right or that is right.

16
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:29,380
A man lands up himself into confusion because
of ignorance. Now this ignorance, as has been

17
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,370
described by all the prophets and saints,
is just a myth, like if you have darkness

18
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:44,200
here that doesn't mean it exists, but because
there is no light. In the negation of the

19
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:51,200
light gives you the darkness.
Where is the light, and how do we awaken it?

20
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:05,950
This question has been very much looked into
by thousands and thousands of people earlier

21
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:14,650
also, and thousands of years back people have
bothered to find out where is this light and

22
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:21,790
how do we awaken it. Now this light is within
us because they found it, and the method they

23
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:30,990
have said also is within us because they knew
about it. But this knowledge was quite a big

24
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:38,280
secret for many years, thousands of years,
and was not given to people because people

25
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:45,280
were not ready to accept it and to take advantage
of it. But we should not say that it was not

26
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:53,880
said. It was very clearly said in most of
the scriptures that you are to be born again.

27
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:02,400
Unless and until you know yourself you cannot
know God. First you know yourself and then

28
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,400
you will know God Almighty. For example, supposing
we are coming to Birmingham and we do not

29
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:22,540
know the way, and we get lost. We can come
here, can be brought properly, but the car

30
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:32,539
that you are driving, you don't know the car.
You don't know how to drive. You don't know

31
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:39,870
the way. Then how are you to reach the right
place? If everything is missing, how can you

32
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:47,510
say that you can reach Birmingham without
any knowledge about it? In the same way, if

33
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:53,650
you have no knowledge of yourself itself,
how can you know God when you have not known

34
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,639
yourself? It is very logical, and extremely
simple logic should tell you that you do not

35
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:06,639
know about yourself.
People become mad and when they are absolutely

36
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,270
gone cases they end up into lunatic asylum.
But when it starts they do not know. They

37
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:18,310
get cancer diseases, terminal diseases of
the worst type, and they don't know how to

38
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:25,310
overcome it. Till they have reached their
last stage they do not even feel it. Suddenly

39
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:31,160
they discover, "O God, I have this disease."
So we do not know even our physical being

40
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:38,160
that when it is hurt, when it is in danger,
when it is diseased we have no idea. We do

41
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:45,389
not know our mental being either.
When we are impressed by other people we start

42
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:51,300
behaving like them. When they mesmerize us,
we start following them. We are not aware

43
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:58,030
that we have no mind of our own; we are just
following something that is very aggressive

44
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:05,030
and that's how we accept it. If you are accepting
something about which you have no idea just

45
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:16,050
because you are impressed by somebody's personality
or the way he talks or the way he comes to

46
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,110
you, then definitely your mind you do not
know.

47
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:28,110
Like Hitler, he came with funny ideas. He
told people that, "We are a very great race

48
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:36,380
and we have a right to kill everyone and to
put the people in the gas chamber." They accepted.

49
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:46,389
How can you accept such a mass massacre of
people like that? But they did accept. The

50
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:53,389
reason was they did not know what is their
mind. We do not know our emotions also. We

51
00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:00,360
say, "This is my son. I'll give my life for
this son. I'll do this for him. This is my

52
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,360
daughter. This is my father." But when it
comes to selfishness everything drops out.

53
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,900
So we do not also know our emotions. If we
had known we would not talk like that. Every

54
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,090
moment we are changing our mood from this
to that. Sometimes we are happy with that

55
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,889
person. Then we are very unhappy. Then we
become enemy of that person. We fight for

56
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:28,630
that person first. We say, "No, this is my
brother," and then we say, "No, he is my enemy."

57
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,979
Why? Because both of them do not know their
mind.

58
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:39,979
So first we must know ourselves by which we
get the light to know all these things. Now

59
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,580
what is that self? What is that Spirit, that
Atma about which all the great people have

60
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:56,580
talked? Where does it reside within us? It
resides in our heart. Now when I say this,

61
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:05,490
you need not accept Me. In these modern times
nothing should be accepted blindfolded. It's

62
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,900
very dangerous. That's how you have fallen
into traps of so many wrong people. When I

63
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:17,240
say that you should only have an open mind
of a scientist, to see whatever Mother is

64
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:24,240
saying is true or not. Now the time has come
that God can be proved scientifically. The

65
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:35,520
science of Sahaja Yoga can prove that there
is God. The science of Sahaja Yoga can prove

66
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:44,050
that there is self, the spirit. It can prove
all the saints and prophets who came on this

67
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:51,329
earth told the truth. It can prove that whatever
is said about the miracles of God is all true.

68
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,449
The time is like that. Only our mind doesn't
go to that side. We don't want to know about

69
00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:05,449
it. We don't want to understand it.
Now this is a special time which is described.

70
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:13,089
This is a very, very special time which has
been prophesized by so many. Every one of

71
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:21,300
them, those who were great saints, have. They
have to be great saints or real saints, as

72
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:27,839
we say Sat-Guru [Hindi word meaning True Master].
Those prophets who were real prophets, they

73
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:34,839
all have said that the time is going to come
when you are going to be resurrected. Mohammed

74
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:43,689
Sahib has said, "At the time of resurrection
your hands will speak." Very clearly he has

75
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,860
talked about resurrection throughout, but
who is bothered to know that? They all only

76
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,860
want to talk about the doomsday so that everybody
is frightened. Another is that we talk of

77
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:03,730
the day when you are all going to be damned
into something because you should be all frightened

78
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:10,240
and you should just go under their clutches
and surrender yourself so that these people

79
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,779
who will be destroyed first are going to save
you.

80
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:21,980
People have made money out of God. Imagine!
How can you have an enterprise in the name

81
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,730
of God? How can you make money in the name
of God? I mean, how does it go into your logics?

82
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:34,730
I can't understand that you can pay money.
How can you intellectualize God? It's amazing

83
00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:41,230
the way they are intellectualizing Christ
and believing Paul was nothing but an intellectual.

84
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:47,790
Why is he there in the Bible? I can't understand
he should not have been there. That way, we

85
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:53,529
Indians are sensible.
We had Guru Nanak who wrote Guru Granth Sahab.

86
00:10:53,529 --> 00:11:00,239
He has taken all the poets who are realized
souls. Not one is none realized. We don't

87
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:06,629
listen to people who are not realized, who
are not of a great evolved state. But this

88
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:11,720
Mr Paul has come inside there, and now he's
challenging Christ and his miracles. What

89
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:18,059
does he know? He is not a realized soul. If
he's not a realized soul how can he talk about

90
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,499
God? He has no business. He has no right.
None of these people who authorize themselves,

91
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:30,499
get elected and selected as big Brahmins and
big pundits and big bishops and Popes and

92
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:38,379
others, they are nowhere near God. They are
not realized people, are they? What realization

93
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:44,629
have they got? They are just interested in
politics, economics and all nonsense that

94
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:51,629
is not God's job. But we get into their traps.
Be careful. You are seekers of truth and not

95
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:03,170
of something that is ignorance. We have had
enough of ignorance. Any person who has any

96
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:12,040
power will never succumb or compromise with
untruth. That is first sign of a person who

97
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,579
is a realized soul. He is not bothered, even
if you put him to jail, you crucify him, poison

98
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:24,480
him, do what you like. And this is what surprises
me. How do you like such people and adore

99
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,480
such people for compromising and meek and
taking to all kinds of falsehood? Take the

100
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:41,139
case of Christ. Did He compromise? Did not!
Any time, He never compromised. What I am

101
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:50,189
saying about Paul was said by Kahil Gibran.
Openly he said it in his book, "The Son of

102
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:54,999
Man" or something like that, he clearly says,
"This Paul, a strange man." I don't understand.

103
00:12:54,999 --> 00:13:01,999
He's not a man with a free will. It's true
anybody who is a realized soul can see this,

104
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:07,379
and all those who follow him are following
falsehood and making others follow him.

105
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:12,119
I must tell you God is not an enterprise.
Remember that. If you understand that God

106
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:19,119
doesn't understand money at all. Is your headache.
You better deal with money, not Him. So in

107
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:26,399
Sahaja Yoga people say, "Mother, what about
money?" I say, "What money? How much money

108
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,860
you pay to the Mother Earth to sprout the
seed? You pay that much to Me. If Mother Earth

109
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:39,389
can take for her love any money, you can give
me some money." How can you talk like this?

110
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:46,389
This is ridiculous. It is ridiculous. So there
is no money. That is nonsense. There is no

111
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:51,619
effort, either. See what effort do we put
in? It's a living process and for a living

112
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:57,869
process what effort are you going to put?
What effort did we put to become human beings?

113
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:04,869
Nothing! Effortless! Sahaja Samadhi Lago.
Sahaj is born with you. Sahaja, born with

114
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:12,569
you.
So what is there for people to put in effort?

115
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:17,339
It is He who does all the jobs. What work
do we do? In our ego we think, "I have done

116
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:23,529
this. I have done that." What? A tree must
have died and you make a platform. So what?

117
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:28,660
Dead from the dead! What else have we done?
Then you make a chair and sit on the chair.

118
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:34,109
You can't sit on the garden, floor. The other
day somebody was interviewing on the BBC.

119
00:14:34,109 --> 00:14:38,730
Poor thing! You see, they were trying to arrange
a platform and I sat very comfortably, but

120
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:45,730
he had such aches and cramp. He couldn't even
ask me proper questions because he can't sit

121
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:51,519
on the platform. He said, "Mother I have never
sat on a platform all my life," because now

122
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:58,519
he must carry a chair with him on his head.
So one must understand that this dead is going

123
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:07,279
to make us slaves. What we do is to create
dead out of dead and think, "Oh, I have done

124
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:14,279
this. We have done that." Can you transform
a flower into a fruit? Can you? One flower?

125
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:25,889
What can I describe? The glory of God! There's
no words. Just think that every human being

126
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:35,399
gets a child according to the family. Who
does that job? Imagine! Imagine that child

127
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:46,949
has cells developed. There's thousands of
cells: some for the nose, some for the eyes,

128
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:54,199
some for the hands. How it develops automatically
-- Sahaja. What do you do? Spontaneous! Do

129
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:59,970
you give any treatment to the child or give
any suggestions to the child?

130
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:06,410
The One who does all these things, how can
you describe His glory? And you challenge

131
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:13,410
Him. Here we are, like Newton has said in
a very humble way, collecting the pebbles

132
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:20,359
on the shores of knowledge. That's what we
are. And so we have to know, only thing that

133
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:27,359
we can become is a drop in the ocean and become
the ocean so that all our angularities drop

134
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:36,850
out. This is the only thing we have to achieve.
But for that also, God has made all arrangements

135
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:44,529
so sweetly within us. He has made us so beautifully;
he has created us so beautifully within ourselves.

136
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:51,749
This is the picture of that tree of life which
is still dormant within you, and the Kundalini

137
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:57,389
that is the Holy Ghost is described, is in
the triangular bone.

138
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:04,389
Now this Kundalini has to rise, just like
a primule in a seed, or you can say the germinating

139
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:11,809
power, and she rises through six centers,
comes out of your fontanel bone area and gives

140
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:22,610
you the Cool Breeze, from your body, from
your head. For that you need not change your

141
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,950
dress. You need not put up any show. Nothing.
It is something inside that happens. Kabira

142
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:35,950
has described, "Shunya shikhar par anahad
baaje." On 

143
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:53,370
the silent apex there is the percussion of
Anahata. Anahat is this "lub-dub" of the heart

144
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,730
you feel there. And then when it breaks you
start getting the cool breeze coming out of

145
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,060
your head. If you call it, miracle. It is
a miracle, but to Me it is not. It's all there.

146
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:09,530
It is built in. There are thousand and one
miracles we see morning till evening. We are

147
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:15,780
not surprised and this is also the great thing
that God has done, that you all have to get

148
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:21,760
your Self-realization. The time has come.
This is the time of judgment, a special time,

149
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,750
a blossom time when thousands of you have
to get your realization.

150
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,870
First of all we have to know that we must
get the light within ourselves. Then one can

151
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:37,180
tell you all about the chakras and the nadis
and everything. Like the light here has to

152
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,240
be put on first, and then one can tell you
about the history and how it came and about

153
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,030
everything else, but very easy to get the
light. Now the other day somebody asked me

154
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:52,880
a question, "Mother it used to take thousands
of years for people to get realization. They

155
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,940
used to be born again and again and all that."
I said, "That was all right." Because on the

156
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:04,540
tree of life first there were one or two flowers
only, but today you all have come through

157
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:10,530
all that. Now that background is with you.
You are just cashing your background with

158
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:17,530
Me. I am just like a banker sitting here.
But even you feel that you don't have a background.

159
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,360
You have it. You don't know what background
you must have had that you have become a human

160
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,230
being, and on top of that you are a seeker.
You might done some mistakes, doesn't matter.

161
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:34,930
After all, human beings are only going to
make mistakes. So we are not to feel guilty.

162
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:39,560
That is one thing I have to make very humble
request that we are not going to feel guilty

163
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,570
at all.
Today, somehow or other, the time has become

164
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:48,990
very short for Me. Your train times have to
change. You have to go to London tonight,

165
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:55,990
and I will start the program of giving realization
to you. But there will be some people here

166
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:02,970
who will look after you, fulfill all your
questions and do everything. They have become

167
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:08,700
experts and sometimes they are more effective
than Me. Especially in India you see, and

168
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:15,700
here I find that somehow I, being a very gentle
Mother, people do not take things seriously.

169
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:28,950
Mother may be gentle but She can be very forceful,
and you all should take your realization because

170
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:37,330
the power of love is the highest that suits
you, controls you, makes you a higher personality.

171
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:48,690
We have never used the power of love so far.
We have only used the power of hatred. The

172
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:56,950
power of love just flows. That is, not to
be seen but to be felt as cool breeze all

173
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:05,720
around, is called as Rutambhara Pragya -- in
Sanskrit language, is called as the All Pervading

174
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Power of God's love. Is called as Brahma,
is called as so many Nirakaar sakshat brahma,

175
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:20,010
but all these things are to be felt. It acts
so that you get cured of your troubles. It

176
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:33,530
acts so that you are mentally a very happy
and a satisfied person that you rise into

177
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:40,940
joy. It acts through your attention that wherever
you put your attention it cures; it makes

178
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:46,600
a person innocent.
As Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous

179
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,730
eyes." Where are those people? Where do we
find those people who have no adulterous eyes?

180
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:58,320
But you get purified.. Your eyes get purified,
and you have those eyes that when you put

181
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:05,320
those eyes on anybody he gets his realization.
That sort of a personality you develop. You

182
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:12,980
are so great and glorified by God. Just achieve
what is inside you. Just get it, manifest

183
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:21,260
it. But truth has to be manifested on your
central nervous system. Not just talk, talk,

184
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,890
talk, talk, talk. No mental projection, but
you must feel it on your central nervous system

185
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:34,890
and you have to become your own master.
That's what when happens then you say you

186
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:42,910
are a self-realized person. It's not that
you do all kinds of bad things and say that,

187
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:49,910
"Oh I am great." Not so. You really become
embodiment of virtue, embodiment of righteousness

188
00:22:54,570 --> 00:23:01,570
and you lose that capacity to be tempted by
nonsense. Nor do you allow any habits to come

189
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:11,370
over you. Such a powerful, compassionate personality
you develop and the whole personality beams

190
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:18,510
with that and you can see it clearly. You
don't become a miserable bony structure, as

191
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:25,100
they put up of Christ, but you really become
like the one Michelangelo has done -- that

192
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,060
sort of a great personality. When they put
up such a picture know that they are miserable

193
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,800
creatures themselves. Ask them if they can
carry the cross themselves that they can put

194
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,380
up such a picture of Christ.
They have done harm to everyone, not only

195
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,510
to Christ; to all the great prophets when
they lived and when they died. They are still

196
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:50,770
harming them by giving wrong ideas about them,
by making money out of them, by spreading

197
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:57,770
hatred out of them. Anything extreme is wrong.
You have to be in the center. You have to

198
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:04,990
be moderate and it acts and works out. May
God bless you all.

199
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:10,700
Today I am sorry I won't allow you to ask
Me questions because there's no time today.

200
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:16,230
I'm sorry I didn't have so much time, but
what we can do is to leave someone here for

201
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:21,660
you, whom you can ask questions. Best is to
get your realization. That will work it out

202
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:27,200
and let's see how much time it takes. Actually,
Kundalini takes split of a second to rise,

203
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:34,200
split of a second. But where? In Indian villages.
I don't know about Birmingham. Let us see

204
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:44,750
how it works out. But you have many people
here who are already realized souls sitting

205
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:51,750
and it should take no time for you to be that.
But don't start thinking about it. It is beyond

206
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:58,430
thought. It is in thoughtless awareness you
have to rise but you don't have to fight your

207
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:03,940
thoughts. You become thoughtlessly aware.
You become -- again I say you have to become,

208
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:10,940
it's not just a mental projection or a certificate,
"born again", and behaving like a stupid fool.

209
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:18,260
Or, "I am such and such guru," wearing his
mala and the guru and the shishas going to

210
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:26,400
hell, taking two running jumps that way. That's
not it. It's such a funny sight when you see

211
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:34,860
those people, the chelas of the gurus the
way they are. Just can't believe it. The guru

212
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:41,860
has befooled them and they have really become
fools and stupid people. So be careful. You

213
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:47,920
have to become your own guru.
I am just your Mother. I am here to give you

214
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:54,620
your realization. As far as the Mother Earth
gives sprouting to the seed, that's all. There's

215
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:00,030
no obligation, nothing of the kind. It's your
own. You have it and enjoy it. Only thing

216
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:07,030
after this, as yoga has one meaning, the Union
with the Divine, and another is the deftness,

217
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:15,130
the art of handling this power of God. The
Divine Power, the Divine Laws, this is the,

218
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:24,190
another meaning. That is in Sanskrit it's
Kaushalam. It's the deftness, the technique,

219
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:31,190
the technicalities. Not of how to handle a
car but how to handle this power, this great

220
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:38,870
power that starts flowing through you. You
become like the flute of Shri Krishna, egoless,

221
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:48,470
and you enjoy that egoless state. That's what
you all are for and you should get it.

222
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:56,720
May God bless you.
Question from a seeker.

223
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Shri Mataji: Just a minute, I'll tell you
now. Sit down, sit down. It's very simple,

224
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:19,370
you see. Your question is all right but is
not thought out. But you understand how you

225
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:25,260
have not thought out. Now just a minute, now
in this light there is a lamp and a light

226
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:32,260
coming out, all right? Now you think about
your question again.

227
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:40,070
What is it? What are you asking me?
All right! All right! God is everywhere, all

228
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:46,570
right? I can't understand what he is talking
about.

229
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:52,230
Bala: Mother I don't think this is the time
to discuss...

230
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,940
Shri Mataji: All right, you can discuss with
him later on. All right, we'll give you a

231
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,080
full chance. What is he trying to say? Just
tell me. One minute.

232
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,500
Bala: He is saying that the Kundalini is wholly
within the body but God is everywhere. How

233
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,820
can you awaken something which is within?
Shri Mataji: But that I will show you....

234
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,930
Bala: On the assumption that God is everywhere.
Shri Mataji: I mean, God is everywhere. Now

235
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:17,950
see, it's very simple. I'll tell you. It's
like this. There is ether everywhere, all

236
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:24,950
right, but how is it that only the radio receives
the programs? Why do you have a radio? You

237
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:30,850
can receive yourself. After all, ether is
everywhere. It's very simple. I mean, you

238
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:34,630
have not used your brains at all. When asking
the questions use your brains.

239
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:38,430
Comment from questioner: "Let the people receive
the"....

240
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,640
Shri Mataji: Now you should not be -- Hello,
sir, you should not be aggressive. There are

241
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,570
many who want it. Let it be. We are going
to give you time. I will tell you all about

242
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:52,570
it. Why you are for the people? Are you representing
them? How are you talking for people? Who

243
00:28:54,150 --> 00:29:01,150
wants to hear his lecture? Is there anyone?
No one wants you. Please go away. Useless

244
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:07,920
man, does nothing for you. From where they
come, God knows.

245
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:14,920
Must be from some guru paid by them. That's
all, nothing else. They earn money and that's

246
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:22,080
how they manage. They earn money; good advertisements
by some people put them up. Some of them came

247
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:28,780
to kill Me because you see they are enterprisers.
So, they think when I say, "You can't give

248
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:35,780
money," you see. In Marathi we say that, or
in Hindi we say, "Pate pe pair aana." You

249
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:42,780
see, his earnings are hurt. They don't like
Me. It's all right. I'll have to say what

250
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:49,910
I have to say. I am not afraid of them.
All right, please take out your shoes. It's

251
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,850
not that only I can raise the Kundalini. You
see, ego gets challenged by that. I don't

252
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:05,470
mean that. If you get your realization you
can give. Actually there's one gentleman in

253
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:11,230
Maharashtra who has raised the Kundalini of
ten thousand people, but one light has to

254
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:16,710
enlighten another light. What is wrong in
that? And then another light can enlighten

255
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,480
just another light. But the one that is not
enlightened has to get their light from someone.

256
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,570
In that their ego is hurt. They don't mind
taking dole from the government but if somebody

257
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:32,910
tries to raise their Kundalini, his ego is
hurt.

258
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:39,910
Such self-respecting people, I can't understand.
It's a great blessing that somebody's raising

259
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,700
your Kundalini. Where do you get people these
days? They only want to have all your money,

260
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:51,820
that's all. Who does that? Have you met anyone?
If you have met anyone like Me, please tell

261
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:58,820
Me. I haven't met one.
It's not that I am something great, but this

262
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:06,860
is the fact. This is the truth that somebody
has to do it without any selfish interest.

263
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:16,450
It has to be done. It's a job of a person
who has no selfish interest. It's just the

264
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:24,480
love, the compassion. So, how can you challenge
that? It is there. It will act and work out.

265
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:32,130
All right, so settle down little bit. Don't
be upset with this gentleman. It's all right.

266
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,830
They are always there to upset. Only one is
not to fight. Now what you have to do take

267
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:44,250
out your shoes, simple. What I say, you just
do it and it will work out. Have faith in

268
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:49,700
yourself. First of all, have faith in yourself.
Forgive yourself. Don't feel guilty. I have

269
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:55,030
told you before now, "Don't feel guilty. Don't
feel guilty. Don't feel guilty." All of you

270
00:31:55,030 --> 00:32:02,030
are capable of this Kundalini awakening. So,
please don't feel guilty. Just know that everyone

271
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:12,130
can get realization. Everyone can become a
guru and everyone can give realizations to

272
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:20,610
others. Is a fact. This has happened. But
if you want to sit on the fence, you go ahead

273
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:27,580
with it because I have to gain nothing out
of you. Be sure on that. You see, it's a subtle

274
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:33,880
type of a ego that works in people.
What do you have to give Me? Supposing I say

275
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:40,880
I want something, then it's all right, but
there's no shop here. It's a temple. In a

276
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:48,080
temple you have to get something and you don't
go and fight with someone in a temple, do

277
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:55,110
you? All right!
So now close your eyes. Put your hands like

278
00:32:55,110 --> 00:33:02,110
this, just like this. You don't have to do
anything. Effortless! It's effortless. Don't

279
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:09,300
fight your thoughts. Don't fight anything.
Just let your attention be loose. Kundalini

280
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:15,360
itself will rise. You don't have to do anything.
Just have faith in yourself, that's all, that

281
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:22,360
you are going to get it. Now 
one thing you have to do is to remember that
the left hand is for your desire, desire power,

282
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:33,760
which they will explain to you later, and
the right hand is for awakening of the Kundalini

283
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:40,850
in the way that it goes into action. It gives
release to your different centers by which

284
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:45,660
the Kundalini rises easily.
It's very simple thing. So, put your right

285
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:52,660
hand on your heart. Put your right hand on
your heart. Now, as I said, the Spirit resides

286
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:23,050
in your heart but God Almighty, the seat of
God Almighty, is on top of your head where

287
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:32,309
you have a very soft bone in your childhood
called Talu. He resides there. But His reflection,

288
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,960
the Spirit, resides in your heart. So here
you have to say, or ask Me a question with

289
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,889
full confidence again, not counting your sins
or anything, but knowing that you are a seeker

290
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:53,739
and you are going to be blessed into the Kingdom
of God. With all that dignity as a question

291
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:59,660
to Me -- you can call Me Shri Mataji or you
can call me Mother, whatever you like -- "Mother,

292
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:06,660
am I the spirit?" Three times. Three times,
ask a question. You are the spirit, but you

293
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,609
have to just ask the question. There's no
harm in asking. Please keep your eyes shut

294
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:33,190
because Kundalini won't rise if you, if you
keep your eyes shut. Please have respect for

295
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:40,190
yourself because you are the spirit. So just
ask Me a question, "Mother, am I the spirit?"

296
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:47,660
We all have to become that. That is the epitome
of our evolution. We all have to become the

297
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:56,539
spirit.
Now second position of the hand should be

298
00:35:56,799 --> 00:36:03,799
on the stomach on the left hand side. We work
on the left hand side. On the upper part of

299
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:11,529
the stomach on the left hand side you have
to say again a question, "Mother, am I my

300
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:19,950
own master? Am I my own guru," because logically
if you are the spirit you become your own

301
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:26,970
master. All these great masters reside within
us. So they bless you for that. Now with full

302
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:37,029
confidence, without feeling guilty, just ask
Me a question, "Mother, am I my own master?

303
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:45,809
Am I my own guru?" All the great gurus are
there within us. This is a very important

304
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:56,359
center. Now ask this question three times.
Now take this right hand down on to the lower

305
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:32,700
part of the stomach, abdomen, and press it
hard a little. This is a very important Swadhistana

306
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:40,119
chakra on the left hand side and it is related
to the second part of yoga that I told you

307
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:47,119
-- the deftness, the technique of the true
knowledge. Here I must confess I cannot cross

308
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:54,940
your freedom. You are free to choose. So you
have to ask that you want this true knowledge

309
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:04,170
and you have to say, "Mother, please give
me my true knowledge. Give me Shuddha Vidya.

310
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:11,170
Mother, give me true knowledge. Give me absolute
knowledge. Give me pure knowledge." You have

311
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:22,849
to say it six times because this center has
got six petals. These are like lotuses and

312
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:38,150
they have six petals. In the same way it looks
after the aortic plexus in the gross and it

313
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:45,630
has got six sub-plexuses.
Now please raise your hand again back to the

314
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:05,119
same position on the stomach on the left hand
side, that is the upper portion of the stomach,

315
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,900
upper portion of the abdomen on the left hand
side, please, again. Putting the left hand

316
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:17,900
there where it was. Now here again you have
to assert because you have asked for the true

317
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:35,739
knowledge, so at this center of the guru there
are ten gurus; there are ten masters. Or we

318
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:44,640
can say there are ten valences human being
have got. So, you put your hand on that center

319
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:51,829
on the left hand side and you have to ten
times assert, "Mother, I am my own master.

320
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:03,230
Mother, I am my own guru." That's what people
don't like. They want to be subservient of

321
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:14,410
somebody who is not a realized soul because
a realized soul never makes you subservient;

322
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:21,410
he makes you higher and higher. "Mother, I
am my own guru." Say it ten times, please.

323
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:34,009
Now please do not feel guilty. Even if you
have been to wrong gurus, whatever has happened

324
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:41,009
has happened. Forget it. Don't blame yourself
for that. Just say, "Mother, please make me

325
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:48,609
my guru." First of all as you have said it,
now you say, "Mother, I am my own guru." Say

326
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:02,720
it ten times.
Now raise your right hand. It's like a play,

327
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:24,210
I tell you. It's just a leela. It works out
so well. Now put your right hand on the heart

328
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:31,210
again. Now you have to assert ten times with
full confidence, "Mother, I am the spirit."

329
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:43,269
With full confidence please say. Don't you
worry. Many people think we have to cleanse

330
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:48,249
this, cleanse that. You leave it to Me, all
those things. You just say whatever I tell

331
00:41:48,249 --> 00:41:54,359
you, please, believing in yourself, "Mother
I am the spirit." This you have to say twelve

332
00:41:54,359 --> 00:42:01,359
times because this center has got twelve petals.
This is the heart chakra, is called as the

333
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:09,150
anahat chakra, twelve times.
Now raise this hand to the base of your neck

334
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:39,890
and place it on your shoulder from the front
side in the corner where the neck and the

335
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:47,989
shoulder meet. Put it tight. This is the center
gets caught up when you feel guilty which

336
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:55,519
is very badly caught up just now. What is
there to feel guilty? Now take the hand from

337
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:06,119
the front side, from the front side on the
left hand, front side, not this way across,

338
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:13,739
front across. [Aside: No. Left hand towards
Me and right hand like this and hold it tight,

339
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:23,710
yes. This gentleman is not knowing, you just
- this hand like this and this hand like that.

340
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:29,119
Can you do it, please? Left hand towards Me.
Yes, left hand towards Me like that, left

341
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,890
hand towards Me. Yes, correct and right hand
here. That's good.

342
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:39,180
Now this is a very important center what we
call the Vishuddhi chakra on the left hand

343
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:45,059
side. Those who suffer from this center get
all the diseases like angina and rheumatic

344
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:52,059
heart and all those things where there's a
slow movement of the circulation. So please

345
00:43:53,489 --> 00:44:00,489
say sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty."
You have to be pleasantly approaching towards

346
00:44:04,299 --> 00:44:11,119
God's Kingdom, isn't it? You should be pleasant
about it. What is there to be so sad or to

347
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:18,119
be so gloomy about? So just say, "Mother,
I am not guilty," sixteen times, and if you

348
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:27,759
still continue with that kind of a thing is
better that you say hundred and eight times

349
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:34,759
to punish yourself. Please say, "Mother, I
am not guilty." Be pleasant about it. There's

350
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:42,029
nothing to be upset about yourself. All the
time you have condemned yourself for nothing

351
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:49,029
at all. Believe me, you have done nothing
wrong that cannot be forgiven by God because

352
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:57,420
God is the ocean of love. He is the ocean
of compassion. He is the ocean of forgiveness.

353
00:44:58,769 --> 00:45:05,769
What can you do that it cannot wash away these
little specks? Some people say that it is

354
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:13,729
difficult to forgive but just see what is
the logic behind it. What do we do when we

355
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:19,739
do not forgive? What do we do when we forgive?
Nothing! It's a myth. We are just torturing

356
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:26,739
ourselves. So just say, "Mother I forgive
everyone," with your heart in it. Please forgive

357
00:46:32,009 --> 00:46:39,009
everyone. To forgive is Divine, and really,
that's a fact. You'll feel much lighter if

358
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:54,400
you forgive.
Now you have to put your hand on top of your

359
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:09,400
head for a while, just for a while, pressing
the palm of your hand on top of the fontanel

360
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:17,130
area or the soft bone or the talu and press
it in a clockwise manner and move it so that

361
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:29,119
your scalp also moves in a clockwise manner.
Press it hard. Seven times you have to press

362
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:36,829
it. Before that you just say without feeling
guilty again, without confidence before entering

363
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:44,130
into the Kingdom of God that, "Oh God, please
forgive me if I have done any mistakes," but

364
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,400
don't feel any way guilty about it. Just say
it three times.

365
00:47:59,019 --> 00:48:06,019
Now here at the top of the head you have to
cross the gross into the subtle. You have

366
00:48:11,859 --> 00:48:18,579
to enter into the Kingdom of God. For that
I cannot force you. I cannot push you in.

367
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:24,869
You have to ask for it. So again you have
to say, "Mother, I want my realization. Please

368
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:31,869
give me self-realization. Mother, please give
me Atma Shakshatkaar." Just press it hard,

369
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:58,880
seven times.
Now you can take down your hand. Put your

370
00:49:38,999 --> 00:49:45,999
left hand on top of your head. Pay attention
there, about four inches above. And now see

371
00:49:46,589 --> 00:49:53,589
if there's a cool breeze coming out. Keep
your eyes shut. [Mother breathes into the

372
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:34,920
microphone] You start feeling a cool breeze
on top of your head. Just move it up and down.

373
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:50,809
Now don't get upset you are not feeling it
-- Vishuddhi. If you are feeling any cool

374
00:50:51,539 --> 00:50:58,539
breeze, well and good. Even it you are not
feeling you should not worry. There might

375
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:05,519
be heat coming out. First, there's a lot of
heat in the body. Let it come out. Let the

376
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:10,809
heat come out. You can change your hand and
see if there is cool breeze coming in. If

377
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:17,809
it is coming you can put down your hand. Little
higher! Move it up and down or move backwards

378
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:33,779
and forwards. All right? Good. Now put your
hands like this.

379
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:43,769
Now putting the hands towards Me, you have
to ask Me a question again sixteen times,

380
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:50,769
I am sorry, "Mother, am I the part and parcel
of the whole? Mother, am I the part and parcel

381
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:58,460
of the whole?" [Aside: that will work out
for Vishuddhi]. Now I will tell you how to

382
00:52:28,609 --> 00:52:34,729
raise your own Kundalini and keep it there
because it has stuck. I know it has stuck.

383
00:52:34,729 --> 00:52:40,769
Still you may not feel it. Some may feel it.
There are many Sahaja Yogis here who will

384
00:52:40,769 --> 00:52:47,769
help you how to do it. They'll tell you, but
there's very simple which you should follow

385
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:55,039
every day to raise your Kundalini and keep
it in proper place. It's first of all, just

386
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:07,160
hold it. You have to put your left hand in
front of your Kundalini, just like this, how

387
00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:15,859
to raise it. That is -- [Aside: should we
give them a bandhan first of all? All right!

388
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:24,489
Doesn't matter.]
Now you put your right hand here and go on

389
00:53:24,489 --> 00:53:31,489
moving it just like that. Take it on top of
your head. Push it back your head and make

390
00:53:32,269 --> 00:53:38,119
a -- that's it. This is the first way we raise
our Kundalini. Everybody should try because

391
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:42,329
then they will say, "We didn't feel it. We
didn't have." It's very simple. Now this is

392
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:47,180
what in the Bible they said that when the
Holy Ghost blessed them they started speaking

393
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:52,200
in strange languages, means the languages
of the chakras, and they moving their hands

394
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,670
in a funny manner. This is the way because
that's how you raise the Kundalini. Even the

395
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:00,910
children were doing. I saw them. They are
-- some of them are born realized so they

396
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:06,029
themselves were trying all the things, so
-- but we are grown-ups, you see. So we are

397
00:54:06,029 --> 00:54:12,249
too much up here.
Now let us be humbled down and take it. This

398
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:19,249
is the first time we push back our head. That's
one. Again second time. This is, we are raising

399
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:28,910
our Kundalini. You'll see the vibrations will
increase. Second time. Third time, three times

400
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:36,630
we have to give, beautiful. Three times we
have to give a knot, beautiful, one, two and

401
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:45,460
three. Now see your hands. Are they feeling
cool breeze? In the hands, feeling it, yes.

402
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:58,989
[Mother speaks in Hindi] If it is not coming
you should not be dishonest. You have to get

403
00:55:03,619 --> 00:55:08,589
it. You should not be dishonest to yourself.
You should be kind to yourself and as a result

404
00:55:08,589 --> 00:55:14,079
of that sometimes, you know, people think,
"Oh, I haven't got it. So what!" It's nothing

405
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,559
wrong with Sahaja Yoga. It's something wrong
with you. Either you are egoistical or you

406
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:24,559
are conditioned. Either you are not well or
there's something going in your minds which

407
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:30,469
is against, or some sort of a thing that works
out.

408
00:55:30,469 --> 00:55:35,229
I have seen there was a gentleman who asked
me, "Why I can't get it?" He was a very frivolous

409
00:55:35,229 --> 00:55:40,109
man and I didn't want to tell him that, "You
are frivolous." Another one was thinking no

410
00:55:40,109 --> 00:55:47,109
end 

411
00:55:54,579 --> 00:56:01,579
of himself. So just see if you are feeling.
Is it so simple? [Mother speaks in Hindi]

412
00:56:18,259 --> 00:56:24,229
Taking the name of Nanaka himself, you see,
such a great primordial master born on this

413
00:56:24,229 --> 00:56:31,229
earth. Just taking his name itself, the Kundalini
rises. [Mother speaks in Hindi] He was the

414
00:56:36,809 --> 00:56:43,809
same as Mohammed Sahib. He was the same as
Abraham. He was the same as Moses. Why are

415
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:56,599
you fighting? Just see this.
All right, I am sorry I have to catch a train

416
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:06,559
because there is some sort of an emergency
for Me to go to London but here is Warren.

417
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,569
He is Dr Warren Reeves. I call him Warren
because he is like my son, he -- they are

418
00:57:10,569 --> 00:57:17,309
all My children. He is here to satisfy your
mind. If you have any questions you can write

419
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:22,589
to him. If you have not felt the vibrations
don't go away. Raise your hands. There are

420
00:57:22,589 --> 00:57:28,729
at least here thirty to forty Sahaja Yogis
who have been imported. Now we have to import

421
00:57:28,729 --> 00:57:35,339
people from Birmingham to London. So there
are so many have come. Please just listen

422
00:57:35,339 --> 00:57:41,569
to them. You can outbeat them in no time.
There is nothing to feel bad and this is how

423
00:57:41,569 --> 00:57:48,569
you are going to achieve, that is being prophesized.
And now you can ask a question, "Is there

424
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:56,390
God?" Ask a question, "Is the God miraculous?
All the miracles of Christ -- are they correct?"

425
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:03,239
Real, ask a question and you'll get the answer
as tremendous vibrations. You become a computer

426
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:10,239
which is living computer. That's how you can
prove everything. Everything can be proved.

427
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:15,499
May God bless you all.
There are people here. Dr Warren will tell

428
00:58:15,499 --> 00:58:20,660
you about it. He is going to stay on. He has
given realization to I don't know how many

429
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:25,709
thousands people in Australia, but somehow
Australians are very much in the center. I

430
00:58:25,709 --> 00:58:31,890
must say Australians are very different. English
now think that they have punished Australians;

431
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:38,690
so now they are great. It's not so. In Australia
great saints are born. So in England also

432
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:44,749
but we have to become. So the becoming is
the point. We have a very nice center in Birmingham

433
00:58:44,749 --> 00:58:49,539
and I've been coming to this hall I don't
know how many times, and to Birmingham. I

434
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:56,539
hope you people become the tree. Now the seed
has sprouted but just don't give it up. Become

435
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:03,940
the tree. That's very important; otherwise
it's just a waste and is a sin against yourself

436
00:59:04,269 --> 00:59:10,709
if you do that. So may God bless you. I don't
think you have questions.
