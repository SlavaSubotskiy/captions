1
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:30,699
Today we have gathered here on the right occasion

2
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:37,741
and very auspicious day to worship Shri Ganesha.

3
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:45,241
Shri Ganesha is the first Deity that was created

4
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:53,824
so that the whole Universe is filled with auspiciousness,

5
00:00:55,908 --> 00:01:04,075
with peace, bliss, and spirituality.

6
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:12,908
He is the source.

7
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:19,783
He’s the source of spirituality.

8
00:01:23,158 --> 00:01:27,949
As a result of that all other things follow.

9
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:33,824
Like when it rains and is windy

10
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:37,783
you feel a coolness in the atmosphere.

11
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:47,824
In the same way when Shri Ganesha emits His Power

12
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:53,783
we feel all these three things within and without.

13
00:01:55,949 --> 00:02:04,991
But it has been so unfortunate, specially in the West,

14
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:15,699
that the most important fundamental Deity

15
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:19,699
has been completely not only neglected,

16
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:23,783
but insulted and crucified.

17
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:30,241
So today though I did not want to say anything

18
00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:36,699
to upset you people, but I must tell you

19
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:44,116
that worshiping Shri Ganesha means there has to be

20
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:46,908
a thorough cleansing within you.

21
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:51,658
When you worship Shri Ganesha

22
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:58,783
keep your mind clean, keep your heart clean,

23
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:01,908
keep your being clean -

24
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:06,991
no thoughts of lust and greed should come up.

25
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:11,075
Actually when the Kundalini rises

26
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:14,991
Ganesha had to be awakened within us,

27
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:17,658
the innocence has to come up –

28
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:27,991
which obliterates all such degrading ideas within us.

29
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:35,783
If ascent has to be achieved, we have to understand

30
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:41,200
that we have to mature.

31
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:48,783
People are sick now.

32
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:53,866
All over the western life one feels they are sick.

33
00:03:53,991 --> 00:03:59,158
Sick because they have never recognized Shri Ganesha.

34
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:06,741
If one Freud came that doesn’t mean that you should accept him.

35
00:04:06,783 --> 00:04:14,824
But you did - as if it was such an important thing to be done;

36
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:19,991
there was nothing more important than that.

37
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:31,908
So today we are faced with our power of ascent

38
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:36,200
and the power of conditionings we have had.

39
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:39,116
When Freud talks of conditioning he didn’t know

40
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:42,200
he was putting another type of horrid conditionings on you,

41
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,241
terrible.

42
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:54,200
Sex is not important for human beings at all,

43
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:59,116
is not at all important.

44
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,241
It is only when you want to have children

45
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:08,116
actually a human being

46
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:11,824
who is of the highest level will indulge into a sex.

47
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:17,824
The lure, the romance, this nonsense and all that

48
00:05:17,824 --> 00:05:22,783
doesn’t exist in a pure mind; it’s all a human creation.

49
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:36,783
And this servility one has to that is so much surprising,

50
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:44,116
it comes from a very low grading within us.

51
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:49,783
It comes from the low-graded human beings

52
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:58,741
that one becomes servile to it.

53
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:01,991
You should be the master of that.

54
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:09,824
And today when I see around Myself, in the West,

55
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:12,991
which is also part and parcel of the same creation,

56
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:23,783
so much of sickness that has come, I am really aghast,

57
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,699
how to turn your attention now to the maturity of sex.

58
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:37,783
When the sex matures you become a father, a mother,

59
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:40,949
and a pure personality.

60
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:48,116
When you hear about a ninety-year old woman

61
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,949
marrying a nineteen-year old boy,

62
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,783
I mean, you just don’t understand,

63
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:56,824
this is - what sort of a society it has been created in this world,

64
00:06:56,824 --> 00:07:02,033
this kind of a stupid behaviour?

65
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:04,824
We have to mature ourselves.

66
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:12,741
That doesn’t mean I’m saying austerity at young age,

67
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:19,200
that doesn’t mean that. Another absurdity is that.

68
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:22,699
But of course you must mature;

69
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:24,866
you need a tapasya for that.

70
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:31,033
Unimportant thing when become important

71
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:36,991
and such unimportant thing that they’re just like anything

72
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:38,824
that we have, like we have hair.

73
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:42,949
Even if you lose hair it means something.

74
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:47,200
But if you lose sex, what’s wrong with it? It’s very good.

75
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:50,741
Good riddance of bad rubbish.

76
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:53,824
Such a waste of energy.

77
00:07:58,908 --> 00:08:04,158
So much interest, so much of a precious attention,

78
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:07,241
so much of auspiciousness is spent

79
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:10,158
in this kind of a nonsensical thing.

80
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:17,908
So to worship Ganesha one has to understand

81
00:08:17,908 --> 00:08:18,949
we have to mature.

82
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:24,158
Maturity has to come within us.

83
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:31,866
We have to go deeper within ourselves;

84
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:38,075
our attention has to go deeper within ourselves, spontaneously.

85
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:44,824
How do we achieve the depth if we are still like worms?

86
00:08:50,908 --> 00:08:54,908
Otherwise it’s a great sort of a sacrifice

87
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:59,908
or a pressure on people.

88
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,949
These tags and these pressures have been very costly

89
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,033
for you people, very costly.

90
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:16,075
You have paid through so much;

91
00:09:17,741 --> 00:09:21,658
you have gone through so much. For what?

92
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:33,241
So the priorities have to change

93
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:36,116
if Shri Ganesha is to be worshipped.

94
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,991
What are we worshipping today is the innocence within us.

95
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:49,741
We are worshipping that is auspicious, which is innocent.

96
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:57,033
Innocence, which is deep down within us - that’s our character,

97
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,866
that’s our nature, that’s what we are born with –

98
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:08,991
is the basic of this whole Creation;

99
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:14,949
is the essence of this Creation.

100
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:23,699
So when matter becomes active, all right, reproduction starts,

101
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:29,699
animal stage comes in, then comes the stage of human beings

102
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,200
who are primitive, then comes the stage

103
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,949
where human beings are developed.

104
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:40,699
Not the way what we understand of the developed world, horrible.

105
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,866
I’ll never call them developed by any chance at all.

106
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:47,658
What is development is not outside.

107
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:51,116
What is the within development one has to see.

108
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:54,116
What have we grown inside?

109
00:10:56,783 --> 00:10:59,908
What have we got inside ourselves?

110
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:08,824
Anything that gross, big, is plastic, of that kind.

111
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:13,866
The one which hasn’t got any inner power grown,

112
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:16,241
say, for example, I give you a mango.

113
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:17,949
I said, “All right, now you eat it.”

114
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:23,116
And you see it just has the cover and nothing inside it,

115
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:28,158
what will you eat? Will you eat that plastic?

116
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,158
Anything that grown like that is plastic, is dead.

117
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,866
What is the substance inside, let’s see.

118
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:49,783
What is our substance within ourselves?

119
00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:58,991
This is what Christ preached – morality point.

120
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:03,116
So important for Him it was.

121
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:07,241
Because after dharma, which was a balance,

122
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:10,783
where of course morality is very important,

123
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:18,116
but it was necessary for Christ to talk of the innate,

124
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:23,200
deeper morality, which is a part and parcel of a being,

125
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:27,033
it is not just taught, or told, or frightened

126
00:12:27,033 --> 00:12:29,991
because there’s a fear of God and wrath of God.

127
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:33,658
But it should be your own innate light,

128
00:12:33,658 --> 00:12:36,783
that’s why Christ talked about it.

129
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:47,908
And the same Christ was used to demolish innocence.

130
00:12:52,783 --> 00:12:57,658
And I would not say that people were not warned.

131
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:00,241
Freud was not the only person who was born.

132
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:06,991
The other day I went to Prado in Spain

133
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:11,200
and I saw paintings after paintings of the hell.

134
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,241
And all these modern times we see those lanky pankies

135
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:18,241
going around without clothes, sort of people were shown

136
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:21,158
with all kind of funny things, stupid things they were doing.

137
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,075
This was Bosch. I was surprised, a German, Bosch,

138
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:28,783
who showed all this nonsense there, very clearly - way to hell,

139
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:31,824
then the attack of the death, all these things.

140
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:35,116
I mean he was quite a recent person.

141
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:42,949
If you call Blake as a madcap, so what about Bosch?

142
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:47,741
Everybody’s a madcap, except for the stupid useless people.

143
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:58,699
So much warning has come for us. For example, we can say,

144
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:01,658
since long we know about hell.

145
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:06,033
Mahavira of all the persons wrote so clearly about hell.

146
00:14:06,075 --> 00:14:08,866
This is hell.

147
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:23,033
But in the West the priorities are absolutely upside down.

148
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:30,658
What is your power? Just think of it. Think within yourself.

149
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:33,866
Is it mental power that’s important?

150
00:14:33,908 --> 00:14:36,866
I have told you mental power has nothing to do,

151
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:40,158
because it is just linear, it moves in one direction, falls off,

152
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:48,200
comes back to you. It has no substance in it.

153
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,949
It’s just a mind projection, plastic.

154
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,991
What is your emotional power?

155
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,241
Emotions that you have takes you where?

156
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:12,033
See you have emotions for, even good emotions you have.

157
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:15,741
Say, you love your wife very much.

158
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:19,783
Where does it take you?

159
00:15:19,824 --> 00:15:24,741
There was a poet called Tulsidasa who loved his wife very much

160
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,116
and she had gone to her mother’s place.

161
00:15:28,116 --> 00:15:34,658
So he couldn’t bear it and went to see her

162
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:41,949
and he climbed over to her balcony and she got a fright.

163
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:42,949
She said, “How did you climb?”

164
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:45,033
He said, “You had put a rope there.” She said, “No.”

165
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:47,783
And they saw it was a big snake hanging.

166
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,741
So she said, “The amount of love you have for me,

167
00:15:53,741 --> 00:15:56,116
if you have that for God, where will you be?”

168
00:16:02,033 --> 00:16:05,824
So where does these emotions take you - to frustration,

169
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:09,033
to unhappiness, to our destruction.

170
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:16,075
The mental power gives you a horrible thing called ego,

171
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,783
which destroys others.

172
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:21,033
And the emotional power gives you

173
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:26,200
nothing but crying, weeping, and always feeling unhappy,

174
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:29,991
“Oh, I have done so much of emotional investment

175
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:33,033
on such and such person and what did I get?”

176
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:42,824
So it is not absolute, it’s relative.

177
00:16:44,158 --> 00:16:47,658
And mentally you are zero if you cannot destroy others.

178
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,783
Emotionally you are zero

179
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:58,783
because you cannot overpower people with your emotions.

180
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,699
So what is your power? Where does your power lie?

181
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:16,866
It lies in the Spirit. But even before the Spirit is achieved,

182
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:23,075
what is your power? Is Kundalini? She’s sleeping.

183
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:26,158
Then what is your power?

184
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:31,991
Is your chastity.

185
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,658
If a man is chaste, chaste temperament he has

186
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:52,241
and he stands up in his chastity, it acts, it works.

187
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,658
But first of all chastity pays dividend in your good health.

188
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:10,824
From the face of a person you can say

189
00:18:10,866 --> 00:18:13,033
that this person is a chaste man.

190
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:23,824
Like in our Shastras used to say a Saint or a brahmachari,

191
00:18:23,824 --> 00:18:26,116
the one who has never had sex in life,

192
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:28,824
always shining on his face.

193
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:34,158
And as we say that the greatest brahmachari was Shri Krishna

194
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,699
who has so many wives.

195
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:48,824
Because no wastage of energy, no wastage of attention is on that.

196
00:18:48,824 --> 00:18:51,241
So the whole energy is inside.

197
00:18:51,658 --> 00:18:55,158
I will say today as I was coming by car it was raining,

198
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,033
it was windy, it was very cold, but we were in the car,

199
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:07,741
nothing affected us, because we were quite warm inside the car,

200
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:11,741
ourselves. We passed through everything, nothing touched us,

201
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:18,116
nothing bothered us, we came away, everything fine. How?

202
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:23,241
Because we kept to our own vehicle

203
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:28,033
and the vehicle we have is our chastity.

204
00:19:32,783 --> 00:19:35,699
We are so particular that others must respect us,

205
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:39,741
other must give us homage, otherwise we get into tempers.

206
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:50,158
Did you respect yourself? Do you respect yourself?

207
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:59,116
It sounds sometimes to people in the West

208
00:19:59,158 --> 00:20:05,116
that Mother is very trying to preach about Indian culture.

209
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:08,116
Many people think that way.

210
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:14,241
But I say that one has to learn science from the West.

211
00:20:14,658 --> 00:20:18,783
All right. One has to learn other things from the West,

212
00:20:18,824 --> 00:20:21,866
aesthetics, of course.

213
00:20:23,158 --> 00:20:27,741
Paintings and art, maybe, colour schemes.

214
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:32,783
But culture you better learn from Indians.

215
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:41,783
There’s dearth of culture, no culture at all, I find.

216
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:47,949
What is this culture where a woman is supposed to expose her body?

217
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:53,241
Is a prostitute’s culture, simple as that. Face it up.

218
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:08,200
Where a woman is not supposed to respect her private parts

219
00:21:08,241 --> 00:21:13,699
is no culture whatsoever in the aesthetics of the Divine.

220
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:23,699
So much so today that they are making a film showing Mary

221
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:29,033
to be a prostitute. I mean, this is where you have ended up.

222
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:34,908
In India even if you say this they’ll beat you nicely - anyone,

223
00:21:34,949 --> 00:21:37,075
whether Muslim, Hindu, Christian.

224
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:43,116
I mean, shocking to hear that the way they talk about Christ.

225
00:21:43,116 --> 00:21:46,075
I mean, to an Indian it gives a shock.

226
00:21:46,116 --> 00:21:52,658
How can you talk because once you give up your chastity

227
00:21:52,699 --> 00:21:57,741
you can not understand that there can be someone

228
00:21:57,741 --> 00:22:00,116
who is absolutely chaste.

229
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:03,741
For a thief everybody is a thief.

230
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:12,824
Because you don’t have that respect for your chastity

231
00:22:12,824 --> 00:22:16,866
you can not imagine what Christ could have been.

232
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:18,991
You can not imagine, you can not accept.

233
00:22:22,949 --> 00:22:26,158
Unbearable things are said about Christ.

234
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,741
I tell you, unbearable, I don’t know.

235
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:36,158
I’ve faced His crucifixion, which was unbearable as it was.

236
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,699
But this kind of a thing you say about somebody;

237
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:44,949
to an Indian woman if you pass such a remark,

238
00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:47,908
to an Indian ordinary woman, she would commit suicide.

239
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:03,866
Is never said that anybody comes and says,

240
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:05,908
“You looking very beautiful.” It’s all right,

241
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:08,033
you can say to your mother, “you’re looking nice,” is all right,

242
00:23:08,949 --> 00:23:11,033
that’s different. But you don’t say to any woman like that.

243
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:24,200
You have to turn yourself out.

244
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:30,824
And this is one of the reasons why

245
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:33,824
people are very hot-tempered.

246
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,991
The magnet within you is Shri Ganesha.

247
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:49,866
Many people know that I have a great sense of direction.

248
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:53,158
That comes through this magnet which is perfect.

249
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:01,741
This magnet is the one which keeps you sticking or adjusted

250
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:06,783
or all the time pointed towards Spirit.

251
00:24:06,783 --> 00:24:13,908
If you don’t have the sense of chastity you will dangle this way,

252
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:16,991
that way. Suddenly you become a very good Sahaja Yogi,

253
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:18,200
tomorrow you become a devil –

254
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:25,908
because there’s nothing that keeps you binding

255
00:24:29,158 --> 00:24:37,949
to the great idea of the Spirit. Let us face it up.

256
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:41,075
Now the time has come for all of us, all the Sahaja Yogis,

257
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:47,783
that the greatest thing within us is not sex, but is chastity.

258
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,824
And that’s what will mature you.

259
00:25:06,866 --> 00:25:12,116
It’s very amazing how some people were behaving in Bordi,

260
00:25:12,116 --> 00:25:14,241
I came to know about it, I was amazed,

261
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:18,658
how could they behave like this before the villagers of Bordi,

262
00:25:18,658 --> 00:25:20,741
who are innocent, simple people?

263
00:25:25,866 --> 00:25:30,783
But the best part of it that when you indulge into frivolous

264
00:25:30,824 --> 00:25:36,908
and nonsensical behaviour, insulting your chastity,

265
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:40,116
you really lag in the action of it.

266
00:25:42,658 --> 00:25:45,241
Like, if you fritter away your petrol, your car can’t move,

267
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:47,241
it’s like that, something happens to you.

268
00:25:51,824 --> 00:25:54,075
All the time you go on pinching people

269
00:25:54,075 --> 00:25:57,824
and frivolously talking to each other and to,

270
00:25:57,866 --> 00:26:00,783
what is the need to do all these, I just don’t understand.

271
00:26:00,783 --> 00:26:03,200
And then end up in the divorce case.

272
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,241
Once I had gone to a Selfridges,

273
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:09,741
I must tell you a very interesting story.

274
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:14,241
And in such a crowd there were two people, man and woman,

275
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:16,033
kissing each other all the time,

276
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,991
least bothered there are other people

277
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:20,949
who are also going on the same escalator.

278
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:24,908
Escalator they were kissing, in the thing they were kissing,

279
00:26:24,908 --> 00:26:28,158
I mean, torturing all the Indians who were there

280
00:26:28,158 --> 00:26:31,824
or maybe the other people, Chinese, for example, Egyptians.

281
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:40,200
Such an exhibition going on. And I saw them next time.

282
00:26:40,241 --> 00:26:43,824
They were not kissing.

283
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:44,949
I said, “What happened?”

284
00:26:44,991 --> 00:26:46,741
“We are divorced.”

285
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:51,741
I said, “Why were you kissing that day so much?”

286
00:26:51,783 --> 00:26:55,075
So they said, “Because we were going to be divorced,

287
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:57,699
so wanted to have the last bit of it.”

288
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:03,824
What a level it is. Imagine what a level. What love,

289
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:08,824
what feeling you have for anyone, nothing of the kind.

290
00:27:12,949 --> 00:27:14,991
All the time quarrelling with each other,

291
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:22,200
ending up in the divorce cases and showing off all this.

292
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:27,866
Any deep personality doesn’t show these things outside.

293
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:32,783
Of course, I’m told here that here in the public school it is said

294
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:35,116
that you should never show your emotions outside.

295
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,699
But otherwise you can show anything else,

296
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:44,699
ridiculous or shameless. But not your emotions.

297
00:27:46,075 --> 00:27:49,075
What an absurd place it is.

298
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:56,866
You have accepted all these values

299
00:27:58,658 --> 00:28:01,116
just like sheep, without thinking about it.

300
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:10,658
Like I was in France, one girl came and she was crying.

301
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:12,866
She said, “I will - horrid, horrid,

302
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:16,949
I will never go to these psychologists.”

303
00:28:16,991 --> 00:28:18,699
So I said, “Why?”

304
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:21,116
“They were saying dirty things about my father.”

305
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:24,116
Imagine.

306
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:32,033
And people accepted those ideas of this horrible Freud.

307
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:39,908
Is basically wrong. Whether it is historically they are,

308
00:28:39,949 --> 00:28:41,783
or whatever it is, you better give it up.

309
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:49,158
Whatever wrong is wrong, in the Divine.

310
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Whatever is right is right, in the Divine.

311
00:28:56,949 --> 00:29:00,866
But there’s a real objection now,

312
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:03,116
that people when they go abroad,

313
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,741
husband and wife and this and that, they kiss each other

314
00:29:06,783 --> 00:29:08,658
and tease each other. What is the need?

315
00:29:09,658 --> 00:29:12,075
You kiss the person and come and tell Me against that person,

316
00:29:12,075 --> 00:29:20,158
I’ve seen it. If there has to be some self-preservation,

317
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,908
this has to be your chastity, your privacy.

318
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:29,866
That’s why you have no willpower to do anything, no willpower.

319
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:32,658
Let some stupid fellow come and tell you something,

320
00:29:32,658 --> 00:29:35,991
you’ll say, “All right. We accept.”

321
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:43,866
What is the essence of your personality – is your chastity.

322
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:50,824
And in Sahaja Yoga you can re-establish everything

323
00:29:50,824 --> 00:29:53,699
whatever you have lost, you can.

324
00:29:54,158 --> 00:29:56,949
That’s why the depth is lacking.

325
00:30:03,158 --> 00:30:06,991
And this is the reason there is no consistency

326
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:11,866
in the temperament of people, no consistency.

327
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:18,116
Now you’ll get twelve hundred people for My lecture

328
00:30:18,158 --> 00:30:21,741
and next day not even one, all lost.

329
00:30:22,658 --> 00:30:26,075
Because there’s no base, you know. Like a loose connection.

330
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:32,658
There’s no connection, connection point is your chastity.

331
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:39,241
So there is no consistency, sthaapayati is not there.

332
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:43,741
If you tell them, “You have to get up in the morning,

333
00:30:43,783 --> 00:30:49,033
have a bath, do some puja,” it’s too much for them.

334
00:30:55,866 --> 00:31:02,991
But if you tell, say an Indian ladies or Me, if you say that

335
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,033
“that you wear such and such dress,”

336
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:11,741
I just can’t, I just can’t, no, not possible. Is not possible.

337
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:14,783
I can keep the whole night awake,

338
00:31:14,824 --> 00:31:17,200
but that thing I can not do, just cannot do it.

339
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:24,158
So the priorities are changed because where is your attention.

340
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:31,200
You have everything within you.

341
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,991
You are the storehouse of chastity, which is your power.

342
00:31:36,991 --> 00:31:41,991
Everything within you, nothing has gone out, it’s all there.

343
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:48,658
All that fragrance is within you. Is all preserved,

344
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:53,699
don’t condemn yourself. And you are so fortunate

345
00:31:53,699 --> 00:31:55,949
I’m here to tell you all about it.

346
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:59,075
You are so fortunate I am with you.

347
00:31:59,116 --> 00:32:01,200
Do you understand that point?

348
00:32:03,741 --> 00:32:05,200
You don’t have to go to Himalayas;

349
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:08,075
you don’t have to stand on your heads.

350
00:32:10,908 --> 00:32:13,241
You don’t have to do anything like that.

351
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:18,699
You see, formerly these saints used to sit, you know,

352
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:24,949
you won’t believe, in the cold frozen water or on the Himalayas

353
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:28,991
in the open they used to sit for hours together

354
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:33,949
Now that’s not necessary.

355
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:38,991
It’s all made very easy. But change your priorities now.

356
00:32:42,949 --> 00:32:47,075
The whole attention once goes to your own Spirit

357
00:32:47,116 --> 00:32:54,866
you’ll be surprised the whole chart will change.

358
00:32:56,908 --> 00:33:01,158
What’s the most important thing? To meditate every day.

359
00:33:03,824 --> 00:33:07,158
I have seen people who want to do some course, say, for example,

360
00:33:07,158 --> 00:33:09,033
I told that “You better do some course.”

361
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:13,200
Every day they will go for that course and join that class

362
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,908
and they will work it out and they’ll pass that course

363
00:33:16,908 --> 00:33:20,699
and do it up and finish it.

364
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:24,699
But meditation they cannot do regularly.

365
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:33,741
But now there’s a little gap you should understand,

366
00:33:34,908 --> 00:33:44,949
that once we get the inkling of that joy which is eternal,

367
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:49,908
we start moving towards that more and more,

368
00:33:49,949 --> 00:33:53,158
more and more and establishing ourselves

369
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:56,158
in the ocean of that joy.

370
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:02,741
A little. You see, when somebody wants you to swim,

371
00:34:02,783 --> 00:34:07,033
you are frightened, you don’t want to do it,

372
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:09,991
you are very happy on the gross shore,

373
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:14,033
you don’t want to swim. Somebody pushes you,

374
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:16,824
again you are back, “No, baba, I can not do it.”

375
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:21,908
But once you learn to swim you enjoy that swimming.

376
00:34:23,075 --> 00:34:26,200
And when you like it then you want to do it every day,

377
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,783
regularly, religiously.

378
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:36,033
So there’s a little gap, which has to be achieved.

379
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:42,075
Second point is that as I’ve been always saying,

380
00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:46,075
you are lotuses, but under a mire.

381
00:34:46,075 --> 00:34:48,824
And you know what mire is,

382
00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:56,033
while India is the ocean, so it’s very easy for the lotuses

383
00:34:56,033 --> 00:34:58,991
to come out of the water.

384
00:34:58,991 --> 00:35:02,866
But to come out of the mire is very difficult.

385
00:35:06,741 --> 00:35:09,866
Say, somebody falls in the mire.

386
00:35:10,783 --> 00:35:13,699
If you kick it, you go deeper.

387
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:16,658
If you try to do anything you go deeper.

388
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:20,741
Best thing is to keep watching it and still.

389
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:25,116
And that’s the best way – is to witness yourself.

390
00:35:25,158 --> 00:35:28,783
But your attention is not all right, how will you witness?

391
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:31,699
Attention is: somebody’s going that side –

392
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:34,075
that person you’ll see. Another person going that –

393
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:36,658
that person you’ll see, must see every person.

394
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:42,908
But you don’t see the flowers, you don’t see the trees,

395
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:46,783
you don’t see the Mother Earth, you don’t see anything.

396
00:35:46,783 --> 00:35:55,783
What you see is something hopelessly bad, worse than you.

397
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:03,949
Today is the day they say one should not see the moon.

398
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:09,033
If you see the moon it becomes inauspicious

399
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,824
and you get a bad name. They say Shri Krishna saw the moon

400
00:36:11,824 --> 00:36:15,699
and then He got a bad name; He was ranchordas,

401
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:18,075
means He had to run away from the battlefield.

402
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,075
But that was His trick, He had to run away.

403
00:36:20,116 --> 00:36:21,783
So you are not supposed to see the moon.

404
00:36:21,783 --> 00:36:24,116
The reason is, why it is said,

405
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:26,824
that today we have to see Shri Ganesh,

406
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:29,158
who is the Mother Earth,

407
00:36:30,699 --> 00:36:32,200
who acts through Mother Earth.

408
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,116
Most of the things that we have are from the Mother Earth.

409
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,075
So this time you must see the Mother Earth,

410
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:48,699
the Kundalini and Shri Ganesh, today.

411
00:36:49,824 --> 00:36:54,033
The Mother Earth has created Shri Ganesha.

412
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:58,658
So you don’t see anything outside, you don’t even see the moon.

413
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:02,033
Just see the Mother Earth.

414
00:37:10,991 --> 00:37:14,241
Because the Mother Earth in Her love

415
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:17,991
and compassion has done so much for us,

416
00:37:17,991 --> 00:37:20,866
your Kundalini has done so much for you.

417
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:28,991
And Her Son, Who is the innocence within us,

418
00:37:28,991 --> 00:37:35,241
is to be worshipped today because He has done the maximum.

419
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:40,241
Despite all the insults we have put on Him, all the ridicule,

420
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:44,741
all the filth, all kinds of nonsense,

421
00:37:44,741 --> 00:37:48,866
still He stands up like a little child to amuse us.

422
00:37:55,866 --> 00:37:59,033
If Shri Ganesha is within you become like a child,

423
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:04,991
childlike innocence, you don’t get angry with somebody

424
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:08,075
like a dog barks; there are some Sahaja Yogis I know

425
00:38:08,116 --> 00:38:12,658
who all the time barking, just like dogs or beggars in India.

426
00:38:17,741 --> 00:38:22,033
But you become like a child who is very sweet,

427
00:38:22,075 --> 00:38:24,949
who always tries to amuse you,

428
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:27,949
always tries to say nice things,

429
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:33,658
always tries to make you feel happy. The source of such joy.

430
00:38:37,741 --> 00:38:41,949
And that’s how you become a source of joy,

431
00:38:41,991 --> 00:38:47,949
source of happiness, source of fulfilment.

432
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,116
All the time bubbling with laughter and happiness,

433
00:38:56,158 --> 00:39:03,699
bubbling with beautiful things. How the children amuse you,

434
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:05,783
just see and watch.

435
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:10,116
How they come round with little-little hands,

436
00:39:10,158 --> 00:39:12,200
how they work it out.

437
00:39:15,866 --> 00:39:18,991
How they know what is the right thing.

438
00:39:18,991 --> 00:39:22,824
A child who is a Realized soul is much more sensible

439
00:39:22,824 --> 00:39:25,033
than a grown up person, I’ve seen that.

440
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:31,033
Like My youngest granddaughter was about, I think,

441
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:36,991
three years of age and the maid was folding My sari

442
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:40,658
and by mistake she put it on the ground.

443
00:39:40,658 --> 00:39:45,699
This child just couldn’t bear it. She just lifted the sari,

444
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:49,866
put it to her head and put it on the sofa.

445
00:39:49,866 --> 00:39:52,824
She said, “What you mean by putting this sari on the ground,

446
00:39:52,866 --> 00:39:54,783
what you do know about my Grandmother?

447
00:39:54,824 --> 00:39:57,200
She is the Goddess of Goddesses

448
00:39:57,241 --> 00:39:59,991
and you put Her sari on the ground.

449
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:07,866
The dogs are going to bite you now,” she said, “Be careful.”

450
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:11,991
And she again went and put the sari, kissed it and kissed it

451
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:15,824
and said, “Mother, forgive her, Grandmother, please,

452
00:40:15,866 --> 00:40:19,741
forgive this woman, she doesn’t know what she’s done to You”.

453
00:40:24,908 --> 00:40:33,908
But that sensitivity comes from the depth of your chastity.

454
00:40:40,866 --> 00:40:43,116
You listen to the children and you’ll be amazed

455
00:40:43,116 --> 00:40:47,075
how they talk and what they say, how they behave,

456
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:50,699
how they try to amuse you. I mean,

457
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:52,824
in the West children are very much spoiled, I must say,

458
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:55,241
they do not amuse you so much, they trouble you quite a lot.

459
00:40:57,075 --> 00:41:01,658
Because again, again the same thing.

460
00:41:02,949 --> 00:41:05,699
If the father and mother don’t have chastity,

461
00:41:05,741 --> 00:41:10,949
the children don’t feel all right, they don’t feel peaceful,

462
00:41:10,991 --> 00:41:13,783
they’ll become restless, and then they develop

463
00:41:13,824 --> 00:41:16,033
the same restlessness within themselves.

464
00:41:16,075 --> 00:41:21,116
A chaste man can never get possessed, take it from Me,

465
00:41:21,116 --> 00:41:29,658
can never get possessed. You might be very intelligent,

466
00:41:29,658 --> 00:41:32,116
you might be anything, you might be a great writer,

467
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:35,158
but you can get possessed. But a chaste man,

468
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,949
an ordinary chaste person can never get possessed.

469
00:41:37,949 --> 00:41:39,866
Bhoots are afraid of chaste people.

470
00:41:39,866 --> 00:41:43,741
If one chaste person is going on the road, all the bhoots run away.

471
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:52,991
They just run away. At least I’ve known many cases

472
00:41:52,991 --> 00:41:56,658
but some of them I can tell you,

473
00:41:56,658 --> 00:42:02,741
that there were three of them,

474
00:42:02,783 --> 00:42:12,116
who used to go by motorcycle in the night

475
00:42:12,158 --> 00:42:14,158
about twelve o’clock on a road.

476
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:22,991
And some people who were possessed wrote letters to Me,

477
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:29,783
saying that “Please don’t allow them to go there in the night,

478
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:32,033
because where should we go and stay?”

479
00:42:32,075 --> 00:42:37,200
I was amazed. These are the people

480
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,866
who were possessed by some sort of horrible bhoots

481
00:42:39,866 --> 00:42:43,075
who used to go and rest on these trees in the night

482
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:46,241
where these three persons used to go on the motorcycle

483
00:42:46,658 --> 00:42:48,991
and they actually wrote letters to Me.

484
00:42:48,991 --> 00:42:51,866
Very possessed people, I knew them, saying that,

485
00:42:51,866 --> 00:42:56,075
“Ask them not to go that way, because where are we to live?”

486
00:42:57,699 --> 00:43:01,200
And they were like mad, mad people themselves.

487
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:03,200
I said, “Why did you write like this?”

488
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:07,200
They said, “These people go that way and they trouble us.”

489
00:43:14,908 --> 00:43:22,116
And the negative within us disappears

490
00:43:22,158 --> 00:43:25,075
with the light of Shri Ganesha.

491
00:43:29,658 --> 00:43:32,866
You can see it so clearly in another person.

492
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:37,699
If you don’t have chastity you can never see

493
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:40,699
who is unchaste or chaste, you can not.

494
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:43,783
Everybody just the same, “Very good, very good,

495
00:43:43,783 --> 00:43:45,658
very nice person, very nice person”.

496
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:54,241
I mean real possessed people are certified as very good people,

497
00:43:54,658 --> 00:43:58,783
in Sahaja Yoga also sometimes and I start wondering,

498
00:43:58,783 --> 00:44:03,741
“What’s happening, what is it? How is it these people

499
00:44:03,783 --> 00:44:10,866
are certified as that? Can’t they feel it?” There’s no light.

500
00:44:12,241 --> 00:44:14,241
Even if you get your Realization,

501
00:44:14,658 --> 00:44:21,158
even if your Spirit is working out your collective consciousness,

502
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,116
even if you are giving Self Realization to others,

503
00:44:24,158 --> 00:44:28,033
you are nowhere if you have no chastity.

504
00:44:33,158 --> 00:44:36,991
That’s like a broken glass which is trying to reflect something;

505
00:44:37,033 --> 00:44:39,200
it can never give the right picture.

506
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:45,658
It’s so important. And I have to tell you this now.

507
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:50,158
The time has come for Me to tell you – this is the snag in our life.

508
00:44:53,075 --> 00:44:57,158
First thing people will ask, “Whom I’m going to marry?”

509
00:44:57,158 --> 00:45:04,033
What is such a hurry? Of course, marriage I call it

510
00:45:04,033 --> 00:45:06,741
an auspicious thing, marriage should be there,

511
00:45:06,741 --> 00:45:09,699
there should be a collective sanction, everything, but for what?

512
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:16,033
To adore the chastity within us. Then they are married,

513
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:18,741
then they have children. Then they want to have a house,

514
00:45:18,783 --> 00:45:20,241
then they want to have this.

515
00:45:20,658 --> 00:45:24,949
There’s whole such an insular business goes on, and on, and on,

516
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:28,783
and the light of your life doesn’t spread.

517
00:45:33,741 --> 00:45:36,949
But I’ve known people who were just in the hell

518
00:45:36,991 --> 00:45:39,658
and have come out and have spread light,

519
00:45:39,699 --> 00:45:47,699
beautiful meteoric heights they have achieved.

520
00:45:47,699 --> 00:45:49,241
I’ve seen people like that.

521
00:45:53,658 --> 00:45:57,658
So today you have come to worship Shri Ganesha - within yourself.

522
00:45:57,658 --> 00:46:01,158
What is Me to worship as Ganesha I don’t understand.

523
00:46:04,991 --> 00:46:10,908
Because I’m That. When you are worshiping Me

524
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:14,033
you want to have that Shri Ganesh within you awakened.

525
00:46:17,783 --> 00:46:20,200
Let that be awakened within you.

526
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:25,658
Let what I say becomes the mantra to awaken that within you,

527
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:32,658
so that as My children you enjoy the bliss of chastity

528
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:37,783
as I have enjoyed all My human life and all My Divine lives.

529
00:46:39,908 --> 00:46:43,158
You enjoy the same quantity, that’s what I want.

530
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,991
At least you should have the taste of it.

531
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:52,991
I’m telling you about something

532
00:46:52,991 --> 00:46:54,991
which you may not have heard before.

533
00:46:54,991 --> 00:46:57,741
But you never heard about Kundalini also.

534
00:46:57,783 --> 00:47:01,824
You had never heard about Self Realization like this.

535
00:47:02,991 --> 00:47:08,158
But today I think by chance, absolutely in a Sahaja way,

536
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:13,158
this Puja was arranged. I was to have this Puja in Bombay.

537
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,116
It was all organized; people were all willing to come there

538
00:47:18,116 --> 00:47:24,116
to do this puja. I mean, a Ganesha Puja in England

539
00:47:24,116 --> 00:47:29,658
or in the West is so important that I thought better have it one,

540
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:34,824
without the right time in Rome,

541
00:47:34,866 --> 00:47:40,075
which is one of the basic things

542
00:47:40,075 --> 00:47:42,908
which has ruined the chastity of human beings.

543
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:50,658
Romans started it and others carried on.

544
00:47:51,658 --> 00:48:04,699
But it was to be here in Brighton at the Lotus Feet of Sadashiva.

545
00:48:04,741 --> 00:48:08,116
But the English must know

546
00:48:09,658 --> 00:48:14,783
that they have got such a golden land

547
00:48:14,824 --> 00:48:21,200
and they don’t deserve it. They have to deserve it.

548
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:28,075
Imagine, you are living in the land of Sadashiva

549
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:34,866
where even water beads also the snow –

550
00:48:34,908 --> 00:48:38,075
means like distilled water, clean, clear, white.

551
00:48:41,033 --> 00:48:43,783
Where Shri Ganesha is the One

552
00:48:45,241 --> 00:48:48,699
Who washes the feet of His Father.

553
00:48:51,158 --> 00:48:56,658
Where the chastity itself resides as your Mother.

554
00:48:59,033 --> 00:49:04,241
And you have to deserve that coveted position.

555
00:49:07,033 --> 00:49:10,116
English Sahaja Yogis have to come up very much.

556
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,658
Just the opposite English were.

557
00:49:17,908 --> 00:49:23,033
Coming from Sadashiva’s land just the opposite.

558
00:49:23,033 --> 00:49:33,866
Tremendous arrogance, arrogance so horrible,

559
00:49:33,908 --> 00:49:37,116
which one can not think in Shiva’s place.

560
00:49:44,033 --> 00:49:47,908
All unchaste people are arrogant.

561
00:49:48,991 --> 00:49:51,949
Otherwise, how can they forgive themselves?

562
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:58,075
You talk to any prostitute, in two minutes you’ll find out

563
00:49:58,075 --> 00:50:00,241
she’s a prostitute because she’s extremely arrogant,

564
00:50:00,241 --> 00:50:03,824
“What’s wrong? I’m a prostitute, so what?”

565
00:50:14,116 --> 00:50:19,116
Arrogance is a sign of unchaste personality.

566
00:50:21,991 --> 00:50:24,741
And such a person also becomes insular

567
00:50:24,783 --> 00:50:30,658
because he’s ashamed, ashamed to face others.

568
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:37,991
But a chaste personality is open,

569
00:50:38,033 --> 00:50:40,741
why should he be afraid of anyone?

570
00:50:43,033 --> 00:50:45,783
Talks to everyone nicely,

571
00:50:45,783 --> 00:50:50,783
kind to everyone in all innocence and simplicity

572
00:50:50,824 --> 00:50:54,116
without falling in love in every third person you come across.

573
00:51:05,658 --> 00:51:13,241
And that, one has to realize that this country is given to you

574
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:18,949
with a purpose and if you do not come up to that level,

575
00:51:18,949 --> 00:51:21,033
you’ll be thrown away.

576
00:51:29,991 --> 00:51:36,658
So respecting your chastity is real respecting Me,

577
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:40,866
because I reside within you as chastity.

578
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:48,241
If Shri Ganesha is the auspiciousness,

579
00:51:48,241 --> 00:51:51,949
I reside within you as chastity.

580
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:58,200
Chastity is never aggressive,

581
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:03,699
is never harsh, because there’s no need, you know.

582
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:10,158
No need, you are so powerful, you are so powerful,

583
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,866
that there is no need to aggress anyone.

584
00:52:12,908 --> 00:52:15,158
Why should you aggress, you are not frightened of anyone.

585
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:22,075
It’s so generous, it’s so kind, it’s so beautiful,

586
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:31,991
always fresh and young, yet so sublime and so dignified.

587
00:52:37,075 --> 00:52:39,949
Now twelve years have passed since I’ve been here.

588
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:45,116
Two more years, very intense work is needed,

589
00:52:45,158 --> 00:52:50,658
within and without. Within we have to work very hard

590
00:52:50,658 --> 00:52:52,908
for these two years, very hard,

591
00:52:52,908 --> 00:52:55,908
real tapasya we have to go into,

592
00:52:59,158 --> 00:53:03,783
all of us, whether men or women.

593
00:53:09,241 --> 00:53:12,200
And then we’ll see.

594
00:53:14,741 --> 00:53:21,991
I can say that, we have done good job,

595
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:30,824
with little jump, courage and faith we can achieve a lot.

596
00:53:31,658 --> 00:53:33,741
Have faith in yourself.

597
00:53:36,949 --> 00:53:45,658
Not mental faith but actual chastity is faith.

598
00:53:49,658 --> 00:53:53,241
Chastity is the consolidation of your faith.

599
00:53:57,949 --> 00:54:00,991
When you have faith in God, you are chaste.

600
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:04,116
When you have faith in yourself you are chaste.

601
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:06,908
You have faith in your wife, you are chaste.

602
00:54:06,908 --> 00:54:08,699
Why should you have faith in your wife?

603
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:12,783
Because you are a chaste person, how can she be unchaste?

604
00:54:12,824 --> 00:54:18,116
Your faith in your child - is chastity, because you are chaste,

605
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:21,075
how can your child be anything else?

606
00:54:25,658 --> 00:54:29,741
Crystalline form of faith is chastity.

607
00:54:30,991 --> 00:54:36,116
And that you can have even before Realization. Many have.

608
00:54:37,075 --> 00:54:44,158
Actually like the camphor, which, you see,

609
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,658
is volatile and evaporates into the fragrance,

610
00:54:49,699 --> 00:54:56,949
in the same way we can say chastity acts into faith.

611
00:54:57,658 --> 00:55:00,116
If you don’t have chastity you cannot have faith,

612
00:55:00,158 --> 00:55:02,699
in anything.

613
00:55:03,991 --> 00:55:07,075
Because either you are dealing with your emotions

614
00:55:07,116 --> 00:55:09,033
that you are emotionally attached to Me

615
00:55:09,033 --> 00:55:11,241
or maybe you are mentally attached to Me.

616
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:17,033
But if you have sense of chastity faith will be apparent.

617
00:55:17,075 --> 00:55:19,991
Within yourself you don’t have to have faith,

618
00:55:20,033 --> 00:55:23,699
“Now Mother I will have faith within myself.” You cannot.

619
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:32,158
Faith is something, which is volatile

620
00:55:35,033 --> 00:55:40,866
and the volatile fragrance comes from chastity.

621
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:48,658
So from today we are not going to look at the stars or the moon,

622
00:55:48,658 --> 00:55:51,241
but you are going to look at the Mother Earth.

623
00:55:53,908 --> 00:56:00,075
In the Universe She represents the Kundalini,

624
00:56:00,075 --> 00:56:08,866
is nothing but chastity. She’s just chastity.

625
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:16,824
Can you believe it? What a power.

626
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:27,824
Motherhood, everything is chastity.

627
00:56:30,824 --> 00:56:34,783
Fatherhood, any relationship is chastity.

628
00:56:38,658 --> 00:56:42,824
Purity is again the fragrance of chastity.

629
00:56:43,949 --> 00:56:48,658
Goodness, compassion, everything comes from chastity,

630
00:56:48,658 --> 00:56:51,200
a sense of chastity, which is not mental.

631
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,824
If you are mentally chaste, you can be horrid.

632
00:56:55,033 --> 00:56:58,866
Like some of the nuns are or some of those people

633
00:56:58,908 --> 00:57:00,783
who are austere, not that.

634
00:57:00,824 --> 00:57:06,824
Chastity is an innate built-in Kundalini within you,

635
00:57:10,158 --> 00:57:17,866
which acts because it understands Me.

636
00:57:17,866 --> 00:57:20,658
She understands Me. She knows Me,

637
00:57:20,699 --> 00:57:23,158
She’s part and parcel of Me, It’s My reflection.

638
00:57:25,741 --> 00:57:29,783
So make your Kundalini strong by being chaste.

639
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:36,075
People try to do things to look very attractive and this and that.

640
00:57:36,075 --> 00:57:38,658
Don’t waste your energy like this;

641
00:57:38,699 --> 00:57:40,783
you are saints, live like saints.

642
00:57:44,949 --> 00:57:50,908
Traditionally as we live, we have to live that way

643
00:57:50,908 --> 00:57:55,033
and evolve out of the tradition; don’t do something new,

644
00:57:55,075 --> 00:57:58,241
something absurd, nonsensical.

645
00:57:59,116 --> 00:58:01,158
We don’t have to attract anyone.

646
00:58:01,158 --> 00:58:05,866
Chastity is the fragrance in the flower,

647
00:58:06,991 --> 00:58:09,908
which attracts the bees,

648
00:58:11,699 --> 00:58:14,116
is the honey of the flower,

649
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:17,866
is the essence of our existence.

650
00:58:27,908 --> 00:58:31,991
So this time you are all coming to India,

651
00:58:32,991 --> 00:58:39,908
I have to request you to respect Me by not misbehaving.

652
00:58:40,908 --> 00:58:46,200
Not childishly behaving in the manner you see in the pictures

653
00:58:46,241 --> 00:58:48,241
and the films and all that nonsense.

654
00:58:48,241 --> 00:58:50,699
You are above all that.

655
00:58:56,116 --> 00:59:07,116
Attention, achievements are to be seen

656
00:59:09,658 --> 00:59:13,741
from the seat of your chastity.

657
00:59:15,741 --> 00:59:17,949
We can’t leave our seats,

658
00:59:18,699 --> 00:59:21,783
whether we are acclaimed or not makes no difference.

659
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:23,075
We can’t leave our seat.

660
00:59:23,116 --> 00:59:27,033
Like all these avadhootas they’ll say,

661
00:59:27,075 --> 00:59:30,116
takiya sodaa sana - means we’ll not leave our seats.

662
00:59:30,158 --> 00:59:40,741
We are in our seats. This is our seat, in the lotus.

663
00:59:42,783 --> 00:59:50,241
We can’t leave the lotus. We are sitting in the lotus.

664
00:59:51,658 --> 00:59:57,200
That’s our seat. Then all these nonsensical things

665
00:59:57,241 --> 00:59:59,699
that you have acquired will drop out.

666
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:01,241
You’ll see you’ll become beautiful being.

667
01:00:05,908 --> 01:00:10,075
All bhoots will run away, all catches will run away.

668
01:00:14,033 --> 01:00:17,908
But is not austerity, again and again I’m telling you.

669
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:27,200
It is respect of your Being. As you respect Me outside,

670
01:00:27,241 --> 01:00:35,033
you respect Me within. As simple as that.

671
01:00:35,075 --> 01:00:42,241
Today is a great day for us to be worshipping Shri Ganesh.

672
01:00:45,033 --> 01:00:48,241
He is the first and the foremost to be worshipped.

673
01:00:54,783 --> 01:00:58,658
And when you worship Him, you must realize

674
01:00:59,741 --> 01:01:02,699
that you are worshipping His manifestation as well,

675
01:01:02,741 --> 01:01:07,658
that is of Christ. Anybody who talks cheaply about Christ,

676
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,824
you should abhor such a person.

677
01:01:12,158 --> 01:01:15,908
You cannot intellectualize Christ. Anybody who does it,

678
01:01:15,949 --> 01:01:18,075
just have nothing to do with that person.

679
01:01:23,158 --> 01:01:28,741
Christ is innocence.

680
01:01:31,824 --> 01:01:34,908
If you don’t have the depth of your chastity

681
01:01:34,949 --> 01:01:38,949
you can’t understand Him. You cannot worship Him.

682
01:01:45,824 --> 01:01:49,116
That’s the best they could do, is to finish your chastity

683
01:01:49,116 --> 01:01:51,200
so that you never recognize Him.

684
01:02:00,741 --> 01:02:05,033
All that comes to you through your meditative efforts.

685
01:02:05,033 --> 01:02:10,033
Now the effort is to be just that you have to be meditative.

686
01:02:10,075 --> 01:02:15,200
That’s all. Keep your meditation on.

687
01:02:15,241 --> 01:02:17,741
Try to be meditative. See things.

688
01:02:17,741 --> 01:02:20,949
What is witness state is nothing but that you are meditative.

689
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:33,033
So I have decided also that I’ll meet the Brighton people

690
01:02:33,033 --> 01:02:41,158
here tomorrow morning and I will meet all the English people

691
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:44,949
if possible day after tomorrow evening

692
01:02:46,991 --> 01:02:54,116
to tell them how important it is for them to achieve

693
01:02:55,699 --> 01:03:08,824
that state of purity. I think it’s working out.

694
01:03:08,824 --> 01:03:11,116
I really work very hard,

695
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:13,991
you have no idea how much I work hard.

696
01:03:14,033 --> 01:03:18,866
But this is also they said that, is an idea that people think

697
01:03:18,866 --> 01:03:21,200
that others should do all their work.

698
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,741
This is like pound saving, this saving, that saving

699
01:03:25,783 --> 01:03:31,116
and also labour saving. Let Mother do all the job for us.

700
01:03:31,158 --> 01:03:34,075
Mother is looking after us. She should get up in the morning.

701
01:03:34,116 --> 01:03:35,866
She should do meditation.

702
01:03:41,741 --> 01:03:44,116
There is no saving.

703
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:49,991
You can save everything else if you just know

704
01:03:50,033 --> 01:03:56,741
how to save your Spirit. Only your ascent is important.

705
01:03:56,741 --> 01:03:59,824
Once you ascend, everything is saved.

706
01:04:01,033 --> 01:04:03,158
But first save yourself.

707
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,824
For that you have to put in effort. You have to work hard.

708
01:04:11,075 --> 01:04:15,200
You have to go deep into you, evolve yourself.

709
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:21,075
You are quite capable of it. Do not blame anyone;

710
01:04:21,075 --> 01:04:24,783
do not blame your wife, mother, father, country anything.

711
01:04:24,783 --> 01:04:27,200
Everyone can work it out.

712
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,658
Don’t see other people, see yourself,

713
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:33,200
“How far I have gone? What have I contributed?

714
01:04:34,908 --> 01:04:38,033
Let me go ahead with it.” Every one of you.

715
01:04:40,741 --> 01:04:42,824
I am thankful that all the people

716
01:04:42,866 --> 01:04:45,908
have come from all over England.

717
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:49,116
It was right thing to do it in a way,

718
01:04:50,783 --> 01:04:55,241
but this country must be created of that level

719
01:04:56,033 --> 01:04:59,783
that it becomes pilgrimage for everybody to come here.

720
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:05,699
On the contrary it should not happen

721
01:05:05,741 --> 01:05:07,075
that once they come to England,

722
01:05:07,116 --> 01:05:09,075
after that they never come to Sahaja Yoga.

723
01:05:09,991 --> 01:05:18,200
Could happen, could happen with the arrogance

724
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,991
that people have may be that it might become like that,

725
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:24,200
that once they come here they’ll say,

726
01:05:24,241 --> 01:05:26,783
“No more Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it.”

727
01:05:29,241 --> 01:05:33,158
The other way round in India, once they go to India they stick on it.

728
01:05:34,741 --> 01:05:38,200
I have known some people that they came to England

729
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,116
and the way they, some of the Sahaja Yogis behaved

730
01:05:41,158 --> 01:05:44,949
and some of the ashrams run, they just ran away.

731
01:05:44,991 --> 01:05:46,075
“Mother nothing doing,

732
01:05:46,116 --> 01:05:48,783
we are not going to be in Sahaja Yoga anymore

733
01:05:48,783 --> 01:05:52,699
after seeing your developed Sahaja Yogis in England

734
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:54,783
where you have worked for twelve years.”

735
01:05:57,991 --> 01:06:05,741
So today we are sitting on this beautiful land of England

736
01:06:07,033 --> 01:06:12,075
and we have certain debts to be paid,

737
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,116
to be born in this country,

738
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:23,116
and the debt is that we have to be great Sahaja Yogis.

739
01:06:26,158 --> 01:06:30,033
You can make out, very easily, who is a great Sahaja Yogi.

740
01:06:30,033 --> 01:06:34,824
When you say that, “shut that window,”

741
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:38,824
you’ll find most of them will be sitting looking at others.

742
01:06:38,866 --> 01:06:42,241
I don’t say they are all English but could be.

743
01:06:48,116 --> 01:06:53,116
Make others work is not the way.

744
01:06:53,116 --> 01:06:55,949
You have to be really very dedicated.

745
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:59,741
You are not of that level, believe Me you are not of that level.

746
01:06:59,741 --> 01:07:02,949
Don’t look at other people who are here.

747
01:07:02,949 --> 01:07:05,824
You are very different type of people. You are special people.

748
01:07:08,658 --> 01:07:16,200
Try to be alert, respect yourself because you are English

749
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,824
and that you have a special responsibility.

750
01:07:22,783 --> 01:07:27,158
So may God bless you.

751
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:21,866
All the way he has brought the water of River Godhavari

752
01:08:21,866 --> 01:08:27,699
which flows in the Nasik, in the river, Nasik.

753
01:08:28,658 --> 01:08:32,158
You see you know that where Shri Rama and Shri Sita

754
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,908
and Lakshmana all lived there in Nasik.

755
01:08:36,741 --> 01:08:41,283
And this river is called as the Ganges of the south. Godhavari.

756
01:08:44,075 --> 01:08:50,658
He got the water from Godhavari. See the vibrations flowing.

757
01:08:52,699 --> 01:08:56,033
In the country where the rivers even are mantras,

758
01:08:56,033 --> 01:09:02,200
their names are mantras - the whole credit goes to the Saints,

759
01:09:05,158 --> 01:09:15,116
to the people who lived so religiously and so much full of purity

760
01:09:15,116 --> 01:09:18,866
that the rivers, even if you take their names the vibration comes.

761
01:09:24,116 --> 01:09:30,033
See? Why not one day Thames becomes like that?

762
01:09:30,075 --> 01:09:37,908
Through your punyas it should be.

763
01:09:38,824 --> 01:09:54,158
Every particle of this earth should become vibrated

764
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:58,116
through your punyas only.

765
01:10:05,949 --> 01:10:12,741
Now we have to see that Shri Ganesha state.

766
01:10:13,824 --> 01:10:17,908
The people who have to worship, we have to see

767
01:10:17,908 --> 01:10:20,699
who are the people who have to worship.

768
01:10:23,866 --> 01:10:25,908
Very difficult situation.

769
01:11:00,991 --> 01:11:05,033
Get the small children, that’s the best.

770
01:11:06,241 --> 01:11:08,866
Come along. Nira. Come along.

771
01:11:13,075 --> 01:11:18,783
Yes, yes you both come along.

772
01:11:20,658 --> 01:11:30,116
Very good. Great. Below ten years. All right. Sit down.

773
01:11:49,866 --> 01:11:52,949
All of them should be below ten years.

774
01:12:05,866 --> 01:12:08,949
Not below two but below ten.

775
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:11,949
All right. Come, come, come, all of you.

776
01:12:23,991 --> 01:12:36,824
Very good children, must say.

777
01:12:36,824 --> 01:12:38,908
Tremendous they are. Aren’t they?

778
01:12:38,908 --> 01:12:45,741
What we are going to do is to wash Mataji´s Feet.

779
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:48,908
Alright? How do we wash, she is putting water on my Feet

780
01:12:48,908 --> 01:12:51,158
and you just have to rub. Alright.

781
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:53,741
Come along, four at the time.

782
01:12:53,741 --> 01:12:55,116
Now who are the four?

783
01:12:55,158 --> 01:12:58,824
She will put the water,

784
01:12:58,824 --> 01:13:01,949
you rub, now you rub It,

785
01:13:01,949 --> 01:13:04,824
you rub My Foot.
