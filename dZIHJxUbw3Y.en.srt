1
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,954
I bow to all the Seekers of Truth

2
00:00:24,888 --> 00:00:30,321
I'm very thankful to Mr Henry Tsang,

3
00:00:30,323 --> 00:00:35,542
for addressing you and introducing me to you,

4
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:37,341
that’s very kind of him.

5
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:46,024
It is the one the very rare occasions, where I have seen people in authority have understood my work

6
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:47,625
and have tried to help me.

7
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:51,978
Whatever he said is really very remarkable,

8
00:00:52,048 --> 00:01:01,387
that all these greater people like Lao-Tse, who started Taoism,

9
00:01:01,457 --> 00:01:05,349
Buddha, who was teaching Buddhism,

10
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:15,551
all of them talked about the oneness of Human Being with the nature.

11
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:19,521
And if you cannot combine nature with yourself,

12
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:24,152
then you cannot be called as an evolved soul.

13
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:34,521
In that thing I was telling him about Yangtze river where he comes from same state Yangtze.

14
00:01:34,563 --> 00:01:39,212
That Yangtze river I travelled through with my husband

15
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:44,739
and it’s the one Lao-Tse has used

16
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:47,819
for describing a human ascent.

17
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,102
It’s a river which goes in different angles and makes lots of currents and it's very dangerous

18
00:01:54,194 --> 00:01:55,614
to ply through that,

19
00:01:55,664 --> 00:02:03,060
but they are having an... now a tourist arrangement to go through that

20
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:07,462
and my husband as he was in the marine time, they invited us to see them.

21
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:14,800
So in that the message was that, you see, you are passing through a very beautiful land.

22
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:20,185
You see across the banks, beautiful trees

23
00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:25,735
and very beautiful mountains, which you see in the paintings of Chinese.

24
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:27,625
They are really like that,

25
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:30,045
but you should not get lost.

26
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:38,466
You have to go further, you can watch these.. all these beautiful scenes,

27
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:43,843
sit down there, enjoy yourself, but still you have to go with the stream.

28
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:49,060
And then you go further and further, it's described it very well in his Tao.

29
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:56,408
Tao means 'that it is' and it started showing such beautiful scenes

30
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,395
sometimes that I really felt that I should get out of the boat and sit down there.

31
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:06,669
But he was meaning that in your meditation when you are moving,

32
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:14,335
you should not get tempted by this outward fascination of nature also

33
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:19,252
but you enjoy, be one with it, you just see it, enjoy it

34
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:27,901
and then he says that the river flows closer to the sea, that is the ultimate aim of the river,

35
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:31,157
then she becomes absolutely silent

36
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:36,966
and she spreads out and then gradually she moves towards the sea.

37
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,252
It’s such a beautiful description

38
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:45,348
and I have seen it myself and I can understand the poet, how he wanted to communicate,

39
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,610
that how the nature should teach us, how to be meditative within ourselves.

40
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,990
Buddha always talked about the Central Path

41
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:01,497
and also he always said that our character is the mainstay.

42
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:07,709
If you don’t have good character, then it is very difficult to ascend.

43
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,770
These were the days when really this was the position.

44
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:25,610
In India there were horrible, cruel kings and then they were killing people just for land or something.

45
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,249
This was so much in India,

46
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:39,879
that Buddha if he had not come it would have not stopped

47
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:44,430
and gradually when the awakening came within them,

48
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,730
that this is something wrong they are doing.

49
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,269
They should not kill human beings for just getting some land.

50
00:04:51,278 --> 00:04:53,206
What is the use of this thing?

51
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,692
Ultimately one king, saw the blood flowing through one river

52
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:06,283
and he got such a repentance about what he had done,

53
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:10,937
that he went to Buddha and told him that, "Sir please save me,

54
00:05:10,997 --> 00:05:18,161
I am very guilty about what I have been doing and I don’t think I can live any longer with this guilt."

55
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,918
So Buddha pacified him and he became a Buddhist.

56
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:31,430
Now in Sahaja Yoga we have a way by which we become one with reality,

57
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:36,180
one with this All-Pervading Power.

58
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:39,487
So the first point, if is the truth, is this,

59
00:05:39,557 --> 00:05:43,617
that you are not this body, this mind,

60
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:48,218
or this ego or your conditionings,

61
00:05:48,298 --> 00:05:51,869
but what you are, you are a pure Spirit,

62
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:57,028
which is said by Christ, said by all these great prophets. Everybody has said that

63
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:05,708
and then second truth is that there is an All-Pervading Power of Divine Love.

64
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:10,766
You see the flowers of Sydney, so beautiful, one better than the other.

65
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:13,923
And see how they have grown.

66
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,228
We never think that there is something miracle about them.

67
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:23,014
It is a miracle, the way they have grown out of the Mother Earth with such a beauty.

68
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:27,384
After all we cannot do that.

69
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:34,324
Mother Earth has done it and we take all those living works for granted.

70
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:37,576
We don’t even think who runs our heart.

71
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:41,098
We don’t even think who digests our food.

72
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:44,502
What is that energy which does all these things,

73
00:06:44,562 --> 00:06:50,415
which controls our heights and everything else that is living?

74
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:55,257
So there is a power of All-Pervading Love

75
00:06:55,276 --> 00:07:01,175
and that is the one, which really has created us

76
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:06,185
and that is the one, which is going to give us our Realisation.

77
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:11,514
This energy that is within us is what we call as the Kundalini.

78
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:13,403
He must have told you about it,

79
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:16,935
is the reflection of this All-Pervading Power

80
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:19,156
which is settled in our sacrum bone.

81
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:26,735
Sacrum as you know is called ‘Sacred’ by the people who were Greeks.

82
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:29,062
They were not Indians and they called this ‘Sacred Bone’.

83
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:32,502
I asked the curator, “Why do you call it as sacrum?”

84
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:37,324
He said “We were told it's a sacred bone and there is energy of the Mother inside it.”

85
00:07:37,384 --> 00:07:41,935
I was amazed that these Greeks knew about it.

86
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:49,701
And it's so surprising, that for ancient times we knew about in India, about this energy that is within us,

87
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:57,990
but somehow or other it was the tradition, not to talk about it or give Self-Realisation to people en masse.

88
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,790
One teacher will have only one student.

89
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,290
One guru will have one disciple, that's all

90
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:10,153
and he would just select one out of thousands and give Realisation to one

91
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:12,963
and tell him the secret of Kundalini.

92
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,004
It was going on for ages together till the 12th Century there was a big poet.

93
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:29,545
We had a very great poet, who at the age of 31 years wrote tremendous secrets about spiritual life.

94
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:32,764
I mean, it's unbelievable at this young age,

95
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:35,676
because he died after that

96
00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:39,057
and then he is one who wrote in his book,

97
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:44,815
after taking permission from his guru, that this Kundalini is one she does all the job.

98
00:08:44,835 --> 00:08:49,335
But people who were in charge of Hindu religion at the time, were just like priest every where.

99
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:53,927
They said this chapter is no good, this is 'Nishidh.'

100
00:08:53,989 --> 00:08:58,192
We are not to deal with this. It is to be avoided.

101
00:08:58,187 --> 00:09:00,442
So nobody paid attention to that fact,

102
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:04,244
but in the 16th century we had lots of poets in our country,

103
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:07,272
who have sang the praise of this Kundalini.

104
00:09:07,322 --> 00:09:11,951
Also in Bible, there is that, “I will appear before you like tongues of flames.”

105
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:15,091
And these chakras look like that,

106
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:19,158
Inside, they are very mild tongues of flames.

107
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:25,014
So all these things though little bit described in the Bible, described in the Koran, everywhere,

108
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:32,365
but there was no proper, intelligible knowledge about Kundalini I would say,

109
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:41,094
though in India they had. There was a kind of a

110
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:47,000
you can call religious experiments which were called as NathPanthis.

111
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:51,490
These people are the same who had only one disciple,

112
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:56,051
one guru sort of thing, but later on it just spread out

113
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,364
and we had lots of people in the 16th century who started talking about Kundalini

114
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:08,907
and saying about it. So that’s how we have this knowledge in that county since long.

115
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:14,657
But after the British came, it all became nonsense and nobody bothered for 300 hundred years

116
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:22,181
and all this knowledge has gone into kind of a cupboard from where it came out.

117
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:27,711
Now, I knew about it myself, but I wanted to find out a method

118
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:33,019
by which we could give Realisation en masse, not to one person.

119
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:41,062
If you give to one person, everybody will get after him, or crucify him, or kill him, or give poison or get out.

120
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:49,240
Now the time also has come, this is the time that we say in the Bible is the judgement,

121
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:51,283
the Last Judgement,

122
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:57,490
but in Koran it's very clearly written. See how all the truths are the same everywhere.

123
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,182
The Koran it is written that at this time, which they call Qiyamah, the Resurrection Time,

124
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:07,692
"Your hands will speak and they will give witness against you."

125
00:11:07,753 --> 00:11:12,812
So actually when you get your Realisation, you start feeling the energy in your hand

126
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:17,211
and you can verify,

127
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,941
you can verify what centres are catching and it’s tangible.

128
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,090
As you know, that in Delhi there are three doctors who have already got MD

129
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,312
for curing incurable diseases, through Sahaja Yoga.

130
00:11:32,322 --> 00:11:40,480
Now for diagnosis you don’t have to go in to that horrible, gruelling experience of diagnosis.

131
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:43,392
Just you can feel it on your fingertips.

132
00:11:43,461 --> 00:11:45,908
You can know what's wrong with you

133
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:52,490
and its absolutely curable. I tell you frankly, that definitely people have been cured of blood cancers.

134
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,734
They have been cured about 9-10 years back.

135
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:57,432
They are still living and they're quite hale and hearty.

136
00:11:57,494 --> 00:12:05,721
We have seen that people who are suffering from all kinds of incurable diseases are cured,

137
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:10,091
but they have to enter into a new state of awareness

138
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,341
that is what we call is the Sahaja Yoga state,

139
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:16,490
where you become one with this Divine Power.

140
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:19,480
Then this power starts flowing through you.

141
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:24,296
Most of the world’s problems, if you see come from human beings

142
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:29,278
not from nature, more from human beings and the nature reacts to it.

143
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:34,163
Now when you get these problems

144
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:38,413
you start running about here and there and trying to find out solutions.

145
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:41,322
The solution is within.

146
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:45,817
Within our centres, when these centres are in jeopardy,

147
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:49,388
you get all these physical, mental, emotional problems

148
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,336
for yourself and for the whole society, for the whole world.

149
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:56,461
So now what should we do?

150
00:12:56,474 --> 00:13:03,860
Is to correct these centres by the awakening of this Kundalini, which passes through six centres.

151
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,870
These centres get enlightened

152
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:11,777
and that enlightenment cures them, nourishes them and integrates them.

153
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:17,176
Then you are completely one with this All-Pervading Power

154
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,663
and the correction becomes permanent.

155
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:26,625
At that time they say that it starts flowing through you, you can feel it on your fingertips

156
00:13:26,657 --> 00:13:31,171
and by that you develop all your potential powers which are so many,

157
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:34,801
so many that in this small lecture I may not be able to tell you the whole,

158
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,591
but some of them I will be able to tell you,

159
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:41,923
that the first thing happens to you that you achieve a state of peace.

160
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:47,860
You are thinking of tomorrow, or of yesterday past and future,

161
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:49,500
but present we are not there.

162
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:54,586
Present is not known to us

163
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:56,899
and reality is in the present.

164
00:13:56,956 --> 00:14:02,889
So when you are thinking of the past and future, you are jumping on the cusp of those thoughts.

165
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:07,399
In between these thoughts, there is space which we call as Vilamba in Sanskrit,

166
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,451
is 'the pause'.

167
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:14,668
and that is the time when you are in present, which is very short

168
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:17,370
and that’s why you can never be in the present.

169
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,840
So, when the Kundalini rises, your attention is driven inside

170
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:27,278
and these thoughts expand, in the sense that they elongate

171
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:31,346
and there is the space in between is quite big.

172
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:40,138
Thus you establish yourself into a new state and a new dimension of your awareness,

173
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:43,604
which we call as Thoughtless Awareness.

174
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:45,331
That is the meditation.

175
00:14:45,355 --> 00:14:49,474
You cannot do meditation you have to be in meditation,

176
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,437
it's a state.

177
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:54,903
Then there is no thought, but you are fully aware.

178
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,369
Whatever you see is recorded like a picture in your mind

179
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:04,163
and such tremendous changes take place in human beings,

180
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:05,778
they are surprised.

181
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:16,028
Like very ordinary person, who was playing once a instrument before me was very boring to begin with

182
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:18,009
and suddenly I don’t know what happened to him.

183
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:25,475
His Kundalini was awakened and he was playing such beautiful music and today he is a world famous man.

184
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:28,798
There are very powerful Sahaja Yogis in the world now

185
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:35,028
and I am so very happy that this has happened to people, that they have felt their own energy

186
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:38,423
and they have felt their own peace.

187
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:40,081
The second state that you achieve,

188
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:43,701
what we call, this is the Thoughtless Awareness

189
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:48,567
and the second one is called as the Doubtless Awareness.

190
00:15:48,638 --> 00:15:56,798
Patanjali in his yoga has said, called them, as Nirvichar Samadhi and Nirvikalap Samadhi.

191
00:15:57,682 --> 00:16:00,474
Now these two states if you have achieved,

192
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:04,033
then all your powers you know what you have.

193
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:05,822
You know all your inner being.

194
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:13,556
You know your chakras and you know all the three... What should I say? The Autonomous Nervous System.

195
00:16:13,783 --> 00:16:17,254
like para-sympathetic, sympathetic systems, everything you know

196
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:21,494
and you know how to control them, how to improve them, how to work them out.

197
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,604
So you become your own master.

198
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:33,123
Firstly when you are awakened, firstly what you get is all your talents.

199
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:35,942
For example: I see Australians are great artists.

200
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:41,176
I have seen people who have come to Sahaja Yoga become such deep artist

201
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:44,975
and such beautiful artist, aesthetically so rich.

202
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:50,230
It is because whatever you know is very little

203
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:55,638
and the whole dynamism of your creativity just explodes

204
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:58,898
and you start producing things which are very soothing,

205
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:05,727
which are very beautiful, which makes every one so happy.

206
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:11,537
It’s not some sort of nonsensical thing you do some queer thing just to please the people

207
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:15,336
and show off that you are a great designer and this and that.

208
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:16,766
No.

209
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:23,432
You do it natural, honest reproduction of what you feel

210
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:29,824
and that feeling is absolutely divine and thus you produce really classical, beautiful things,

211
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:35,788
which is very surprising how these modern children have taken to it.

212
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:41,441
Normally the Modern Art, as you know is mostly understood by the artist himself.

213
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:47,355
Nobody else can understand it, because they just go mad and do all kinds of things.

214
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:49,596
In this also you may do Modern Art,

215
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:53,509
means in the sense that you break all the lines and everything,

216
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:59,423
but, what you find that whatever you do is extremely soothing

217
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:03,056
and natural, one with the nature

218
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:08,557
and anybody who sees that will say, "Who has made this sort of

219
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:12,048
an expression of the true feeling from within;

220
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:16,028
nothing artificial, nothing vulgar, nothing nonsensical."

221
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:20,911
In the same way musicians and other things in every art...

222
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:24,778
I was, I have been really amazed how Sahaja Yoga has helped.

223
00:18:24,846 --> 00:18:31,144
I have seen this Sydney Sahaja Yogis singing to you this Marathi and Sanskrit songs and Hindi songs,

224
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:33,711
which not even Indians can sing.

225
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:34,922
They cannot sing so well,

226
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:39,894
I mean if you hear them from outside, nobody will know they are people from Australia.

227
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:43,471
They are Australians, as if some Indians are singing it's very difficult.

228
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:48,663
Indian singing is extremely difficult, people practice for years together to achieve this.

229
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:53,009
Not only that they know it, but also so many of them know it by heart

230
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:57,298
and I don’t know how they have picked it up, this I just don’t understand.

231
00:18:57,313 --> 00:18:58,913
Then they come and sing in India.

232
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:03,240
Even so many artists have said, "Now we are ashamed, the way these people are doing

233
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:06,144
At such a young age, how they have picked it so well.

234
00:19:06,198 --> 00:19:08,875
They sing in such beautiful unison."

235
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:10,894
All these things happen to you.

236
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:14,682
Secondly it happens, that so-called religions that you have, you follow.

237
00:19:14,663 --> 00:19:20,698
Somebody will say, "I'm a Buddhist." Somebody will say, "I am a Christian, I am Hindu, Muslim," anything.

238
00:19:20,748 --> 00:19:23,875
They can commit any sins, it's outward.

239
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,269
It's just a label.

240
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:29,652
Like one girl met me and she was saying, "I am born again." I said, "You are not.

241
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:33,451
You just label yourself as 'Born Again', you are not.

242
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:37,317
Unless and until you get your realisation, you cannot be born again

243
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:42,797
and once you are born again, you get the quality of a personality who is a born again

244
00:19:42,788 --> 00:19:46,557
has so many powers, so compassionate, so peaceful.

245
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:49,247
"You are not." I said, "You are in a delusion."

246
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:52,384
She asked me, "Are you born again?" I said, "I am, of course I am

247
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:54,855
and you can be also if you want to,

248
00:19:54,913 --> 00:19:58,364
but if you want to carry on with artificial levels, what can you do?

249
00:19:58,394 --> 00:20:00,776
what good have they done to anyone?"

250
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:08,567
So the artificiality drops out and your real personality starts expressing itself.

251
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:13,028
As far as the religion is concerned, you become absolutely righteous.

252
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:17,067
The other day, I was reading about the genes

253
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,912
and I was amazed to hear that the

254
00:20:19,913 --> 00:20:23,171
Asians have two genes to protect them,

255
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:25,365
but the Western people have none.

256
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:29,346
Now, the two genes that are within us,

257
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:33,865
one is, I would say, comes from the mother,

258
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:37,008
may be the father, or the society, or whatever it is,

259
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:43,395
but one we call in Sahaja Yoga, 'sin against the Mother' and 'sin against the Father',

260
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:45,806
out of which the left side,

261
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:50,027
when we are there, we are sinning against the Mother,

262
00:20:50,105 --> 00:20:52,987
means we become immoral.

263
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:55,923
We don’t know what is morality.

264
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:59,576
We start playing with things, which we should not.

265
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:05,373
Then we get into trouble, we get diseases, this, that, all sorts of problems,

266
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,545
because there is no protection.

267
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:09,333
So we are very vulnerable.

268
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:13,221
All kinds of indulgences and all kinds of habits,

269
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,913
that we form, which are self-destructive, is sin against the Mother.

270
00:21:18,423 --> 00:21:26,557
The another gene, is the one that protects you against, the sin against the Father

271
00:21:26,615 --> 00:21:31,134
and sin against the Father, is to be dishonest,

272
00:21:31,237 --> 00:21:34,836
to be corrupt, not to believe that God is your Father.

273
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,403
Why should we do all this thing?

274
00:21:36,457 --> 00:21:39,961
So this kind of a sin also, we start doing.

275
00:21:39,977 --> 00:21:43,094
Both these genes that are protective,

276
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:46,218
are created after Sahaja Yoga within you

277
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,913
and you just don’t do wrong things.

278
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:50,688
I have seen people from West, how they were.

279
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:52,807
They give up all kinds of nonsense.

280
00:21:52,817 --> 00:21:56,720
We never have the problem of somebody's wife running away with somebody,

281
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,825
somebody's daughter running away with somebody.

282
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,740
Some rape and all that, it's out of question.

283
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,682
We have thousands and thousands of Sahaja Yogis

284
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,169
and they come together many a times.

285
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:11,865
I have never seen them quarrelling, fighting have any violence or anything.

286
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:14,788
So this, the sin against the Father and sin against the Mother,

287
00:22:14,846 --> 00:22:19,778
just is sort of established, that they just don’t do it.

288
00:22:19,942 --> 00:22:23,123
They dress up properly. They live properly. They don’t take to drugs.

289
00:22:23,182 --> 00:22:25,297
They don’t take all these things.

290
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:34,535
Now you know the progeny, how it is facing the effects of this modern life.

291
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:38,736
Like you see, the children are left to dogs,

292
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,281
they become so horrible.

293
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,560
I have seen in Miami with my own eyes,

294
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:47,567
children who were only 12 years of age, were carrying revolvers

295
00:22:47,556 --> 00:22:49,067
and were selling drugs,

296
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:54,365
because the law is such, that they do not punish 12 years old children in the jail,

297
00:22:54,384 --> 00:22:59,086
so people are taking advantage of these children and they are behaving like this.

298
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:01,368
There are children who are killing their parents.

299
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,549
There are parents who are killing their children.

300
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:07,500
This kind of a violence is the sin against the Father.

301
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:12,798
So both ways you see, if there is sort of an attack.

302
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,605
What will happen to such a society?

303
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:18,478
Is important one has to take to spiritual life

304
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:21,121
and the spiritual life of not outside,

305
00:23:21,181 --> 00:23:27,431
that you just go to church, sing some hymn numbers, this and that and come home.

306
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:30,548
This is not that, it has to be innate, within yourself.

307
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,804
You have to be honest.

308
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:34,182
You have to be integrated with yourself

309
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:42,044
and then this innate religion will tell you, that you belong to the religion, which is a universal religion,

310
00:23:42,124 --> 00:23:45,000
which encompasses all the religions,

311
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,517
which respects all the great incarnations, all the prophets, every one.

312
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:57,518
Every religion is a flower on the tree of life,

313
00:23:57,586 --> 00:23:59,336
of spirituality,

314
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:02,288
but you have taken away that flower

315
00:24:02,278 --> 00:24:05,198
and you are fighting with the dead flower. "This is mine." "This is mine."

316
00:24:05,258 --> 00:24:09,296
You have no claims and is the dead flower which is now petrified

317
00:24:09,403 --> 00:24:12,846
and that’s how you see in every religion what problems are coming.

318
00:24:12,913 --> 00:24:17,855
How people are suffering. How they are fighting. All kinds of things happen.

319
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,298
So people become, they say, "We don’t believe in God."

320
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:23,865
They become atheist.

321
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,574
When they become atheist also, they are doing the wrong thing

322
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:30,490
and those who believe in God, in such a way, are also wrong.

323
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,361
It’s a blind faith.

324
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:36,298
With Sahaja Yoga, I must tell you one thing, you shouldn’t have blind faith.

325
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:40,480
If you feel the experience of Realisation,

326
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,769
then of course, as honest people, you must accept, respect it and go-ahead with it and grow.

327
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:50,286
But if you don’t feel the experience, you shouldn’t tell lies.

328
00:24:50,346 --> 00:24:54,246
You should come again and again. See that you get your Realisation.

329
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,699
There are so many things, as I told you, I could tell you,

330
00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:01,721
but only the attention part I have told you, that attention gets enlightened

331
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:04,429
and wherever you put your attention it works.

332
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:06,884
It helps.

333
00:25:06,894 --> 00:25:10,134
So in a way you start living collectively.

334
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:14,980
You start feeling that you are part and parcel of one whole being.

335
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,402
The microcosm becomes the macrocosm,

336
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,582
a drops becomes the ocean

337
00:25:19,662 --> 00:25:22,250
and that’s how the whole world can become one,

338
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:25,814
one day and all these problems and things will go away,

339
00:25:25,884 --> 00:25:28,701
because through Sahaja Yoga you know Absolute Truth.

340
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:31,814
Everybody knows the same truth, no quarrel,

341
00:25:31,883 --> 00:25:34,921
as you are watching me, I am sitting down here.

342
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:38,288
All of you feel the same about everything.

343
00:25:38,298 --> 00:25:42,394
So there are no discussions, no arguments, no fighting, nothing

344
00:25:42,423 --> 00:25:45,134
and you really become a peaceful personality.

345
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,750
You emit peace, as I told you.

346
00:25:49,942 --> 00:25:51,788
So,

347
00:25:51,788 --> 00:25:56,930
the highest thing is that you enter into to the Kingdom of God.

348
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:02,053
Somebody told me today, “Mother, they... people don’t know what is Kingdom of God.”

349
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,692
So I said, “They have to enter in to see."

350
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:09,727
Unless and until I enter into this hall, how will I know what this hall is like.

351
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:16,701
So once they enter into it, they write to me, that Mother we are now in the Kingdom of God,

352
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:21,344
because you start... drowned into,

353
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:25,188
you feel you are drowned into the ocean of joy

354
00:26:25,238 --> 00:26:29,596
and joy is not double like happiness and unhappiness.

355
00:26:29,653 --> 00:26:35,018
Supposing you have... your ego is pampered.

356
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:38,836
You feel very happy, that I am such and such, I have got this

357
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:41,977
and if any is punctured you feel unhappy,

358
00:26:42,027 --> 00:26:47,006
but joy is singular, it's in that state, from where you witness your life.

359
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:51,451
In a one lecture, program, I don’t think I will able tell you all about it.

360
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:57,393
I must have given at least four thousand lectures in only English language.

361
00:26:57,403 --> 00:27:03,288
So I have to tell you one thing, that today whatever is happening in Sahaja Yoga

362
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,548
is the culmination of your evolution,

363
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:10,105
culmination of all spiritual work,

364
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:14,515
that people have done, all the saints, prophets and incarnations

365
00:27:14,525 --> 00:27:21,365
and is the last judgement for you, so that you enter into the Kingdom of God.

366
00:27:21,393 --> 00:27:24,086
Sahaja means ‘born with you’.

367
00:27:24,113 --> 00:27:26,971
‘Saha’ is ‘with’. ‘Ja’ is ‘born’

368
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:30,201
Born with you is the right

369
00:27:30,256 --> 00:27:35,316
to become united, which means yoga, with this All-Pervading Power.

370
00:27:35,384 --> 00:27:37,823
It is your birthright,

371
00:27:37,836 --> 00:27:39,692
because you are born at this time

372
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,756
and this should happen,

373
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:46,413
but after that please remember, that you might feel very great about it

374
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:51,266
and you may just enjoy it individually, but it’s not an individual growth.

375
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:54,585
You have to come to our Centres.

376
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:57,644
You don’t have to pay for it.

377
00:27:57,701 --> 00:28:01,365
Some people think that this is an introduction lecture so there's no payment.

378
00:28:01,355 --> 00:28:04,130
You can't pay for living thing. How can you pay?

379
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:10,256
How can pay for the seed which is planted in the Mother Earth?

380
00:28:10,276 --> 00:28:14,604
How can you pay to the Mother Earth or to the seed? It’s all built in.

381
00:28:14,614 --> 00:28:16,064
In the same way it's built in to you.

382
00:28:16,134 --> 00:28:21,390
Of course for formally I use to come Australia with my own money and all that,

383
00:28:21,394 --> 00:28:25,728
but now we have so many Sahaja Yogis, that they want pay for my travel,

384
00:28:25,778 --> 00:28:31,438
may be for this hall they might have paid, but you don’t have to pay for your Self-Realisation

385
00:28:31,508 --> 00:28:35,307
and all the knowledge of your being, inner being,

386
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:39,596
your powers and everything, for that you don’t have to pay.

387
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:42,871
All these little expenses, which is very little,

388
00:28:42,941 --> 00:28:49,557
partly I should say, are taken over by so many Sahaja Yogis that you have.

389
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:56,519
In Sydney itself, you have lots of Sahaja Yogis. They told me there are 22 centres in Sydney.

390
00:28:56,604 --> 00:29:02,940
So you all can take full advantage of it, but you must respect yourself,

391
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:06,548
you must respect your Self-Realisation.

392
00:29:06,557 --> 00:29:09,903
After all, you must be something special to get it.

393
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,740
So please don’t neglect it.

394
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:15,652
There is no mesmerism to keep you attached to Sahaja Yoga.

395
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:22,278
There is no other temptations, but one that you have to be one with this All-Pervading Power

396
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:26,932
and this Kundalini is the pure desire, the power of pure desire.

397
00:29:26,968 --> 00:29:30,394
You are aware of if it, or you may not be aware of it,

398
00:29:30,498 --> 00:29:36,105
that you have only one pure desire is to be one with all this All-Pervading Power,

399
00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:42,728
because all other desires if you see, once they are fulfilled, they are of no importance to you.

400
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:48,605
So it is said that, in general wants are not satiable.

401
00:29:48,615 --> 00:29:53,596
You never feel satisfied, but after this complete satisfaction comes in to you

402
00:29:53,644 --> 00:29:55,884
and you start enjoying everything,

403
00:29:55,967 --> 00:30:00,269
enjoying other people, enjoying your own relations,

404
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:02,461
enjoying the whole world.

405
00:30:02,932 --> 00:30:07,913
This is such a blissful time, that you are born. Take full advantage of it

406
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:11,401
and pay full attention to yourself

407
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,076
and understand that just by labelling yourself as something, you do not become that.

408
00:30:16,086 --> 00:30:21,961
Do not fight for something that is artificial, but achieve something that is real.

409
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:27,971
Thank you very much. I hope after one year again I will come back here and meet you.

410
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:32,971
By that time all of you will grow up like big trees of spirituality,

411
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:39,063
giving such vibrations and Realisation, that power you will have, that

412
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:44,037
you can give Realisation, you can cure people, you can help people.

413
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,038
Some people who have never been orators, have become great orators of Sahaja Yoga

414
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:53,469
and all over the world you have brothers and sisters who are sincerely yours.

415
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:54,489
May God Bless you.

416
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:56,229
Thank you very much.

417
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:05,038
I can't see the people.

418
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:13,394
Can you ask them to put the light off, so that I can see the people.

419
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:27,192
There is one thing more that I cannot force Self-Realisation on you.

420
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:30,750
All of you can get it. Must just have confidence.

421
00:31:30,803 --> 00:31:35,990
All can get it, but if you don’t want to have it, I cannot force on you.

422
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:37,875
I respect your freedom

423
00:31:38,951 --> 00:31:43,865
and I have to request people, if they don’t want to have it, they should leave the hall.

424
00:31:43,923 --> 00:31:50,025
That’s much better and otherwise I am sure it will work out for all of you.

425
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:57,432
Can you ask them to reduce the light a little bit?

426
00:31:57,517 --> 00:31:59,673
Put the light, that side.

427
00:32:00,432 --> 00:32:01,653
It’s too much.

428
00:32:04,938 --> 00:32:08,278
Also reduce this one, it’s not too much light on me?

429
00:32:09,063 --> 00:32:11,083
Can’t see anyone.

430
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:32,074
Till I give Realisation please reduce, this is too much.

431
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:36,844
I never used to wear these glasses, but for these kind of things

432
00:32:42,192 --> 00:32:45,115
No, no, no these big things.

433
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:52,779
I want to see them.

434
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:59,403
We need to douse these overheads.  Thank you.

435
00:33:02,596 --> 00:33:05,554
Ah, that proves one thing,

436
00:33:05,622 --> 00:33:09,827
that if you are blinded by something like that,

437
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:13,250
you can not see anything else, you see, so one has to…

438
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,200
So again, I would request those who want to go should leave,

439
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,496
will be good idea. It takes 10-15 minutes, not more than that,

440
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:32,605
but it's…

441
00:33:32,855 --> 00:33:40,256
You go beyond your mind. You just go on thinking about it, this, that, then it won’t work out …

442
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,134
So nice!

443
00:33:53,192 --> 00:33:54,785
Left Nabhi is there.

444
00:34:02,477 --> 00:34:06,586
So, before we start I have to tell you there are three conditions,

445
00:34:06,634 --> 00:34:08,947
which are very simple conditions.

446
00:34:10,907 --> 00:34:15,860
The first one is, that you have to be fully confident,

447
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,110
that you all will get your Self-Realisation.

448
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,402
So it follows the second condition,

449
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:28,427
that you should in no way feel guilty about anything.

450
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:30,347
It’s a fashion also, to feel guilty,

451
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:35,628
all the time, saying “Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.” Even on the phone we use to say, “I beg your pardon,”

452
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:38,521
but people say, “Sorry, sorry, sorry.”

453
00:34:38,527 --> 00:34:43,065
It’s a fashion. To feel guilty is really a fashion.

454
00:34:43,054 --> 00:34:47,931
If you have done anything wrong, just face it that moment and just leave it.

455
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,518
But you carry on with it and that works on left Vishuddhi here,

456
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:57,097
which is a very…very, very important thing,

457
00:34:57,898 --> 00:35:02,369
because if your left Vishuddhi is caught up,

458
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,860
then, you can get spondylitis,

459
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:10,469
which is a very horrible disease,

460
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:13,713
or another one which is called, angina,

461
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:17,143
or you may get very lethargic organs.

462
00:35:17,164 --> 00:35:20,652
So this is such an important centre, which you are spoiling,

463
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:26,181
just with your imaginary… imaginary style of thinking,

464
00:35:26,202 --> 00:35:28,012
that you are guilty,

465
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:32,523
that you have done this wrong. You should not have done that wrong and you feel guilty.

466
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:37,161
Of course everybody has right to feel guilty.

467
00:35:37,184 --> 00:35:39,143
I cannot challenge that.

468
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:43,875
They can feel. Everybody has right, even to cut their throat.

469
00:35:45,985 --> 00:35:49,530
But as a Mother, I am saying, "Better not."

470
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:53,940
Why to do something which is injurious to us, good for nothing?

471
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:57,795
And at this moment, when you are about to get your Realisation,

472
00:35:57,806 --> 00:35:59,655
you miss the point

473
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:02,255
This is the greatest thing that you are going to you have.

474
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:05,117
All your powers are going to express themselves.

475
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:08,447
All your glory you are going to know.

476
00:36:08,478 --> 00:36:12,547
At this time what is the use of feel guilty and condemning yourself?

477
00:36:13,396 --> 00:36:18,259
So just, what you have to say in your heart is that, “Mother I am not guilty at all.”

478
00:36:18,288 --> 00:36:19,349
That’s all.

479
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,809
You don’t have to do anything, but in your heart, please say, just now in your heart

480
00:36:23,878 --> 00:36:26,869
that, “Mother I am not guilty at all.”

481
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:28,380
Second point!

482
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:30,869
So now two conditions I have told you.

483
00:36:32,463 --> 00:36:34,402
The third condition is very simple.

484
00:36:34,452 --> 00:36:39,322
The third condition is that you have to forgive everyone.

485
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:41,364
According to some people it’s very difficult.

486
00:36:41,422 --> 00:36:46,431
They cannot forgive, but logically try to understand.

487
00:36:46,443 --> 00:36:49,184
If you forgive or don’t forgive, what do you do?

488
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:51,123
Nothing.

489
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:56,702
Both ways you do nothing. You just think, “I cannot forgive, I cannot forgive.”

490
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:05,101
But if you don’t forgive, then you play in to wrong hands.

491
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:10,416
If you don’t forgive, then you play in to wrong hands definitely,

492
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:14,126
because the person who has harmed you, or troubled you,

493
00:37:14,137 --> 00:37:22,155
will always try to deviate the matter. He wouldn't bother to see that I have trouble that person or anything,

494
00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:26,226
but you are the one, who will be troubling yourself

495
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:29,463
and all the time torturing yourself. All the time saying

496
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:33,605
that. “I cannot forgive this man. I cannot forgive man.”

497
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,505
That person might have even forgotten you all.

498
00:37:38,076 --> 00:37:40,179
So there is no logic in it,

499
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,679
but more over, when you do not forgive then, the centre, Agnya,

500
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:46,059
which is on the optic chiasma

501
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:50,699
is like this, constructed like this, absolutely like this

502
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:55,583
and to open this you have to forgive, otherwise how will the Kundalini pass.

503
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:57,652
It has to open,

504
00:37:57,753 --> 00:38:02,003
only by forgiving every one. You don’t have to think about whom

505
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:05,833
you have to forgive, what they have given, how to forgive,

506
00:38:05,963 --> 00:38:11,293
how to do it, just say that, “I forgive everyone in general.”

507
00:38:11,353 --> 00:38:12,963
You don’t have to think about them.

508
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:17,304
At this moment, if you say that, you'll feel much lighter.

509
00:38:18,347 --> 00:38:20,760
So these are the three conditions we have

510
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:27,190
and I think it’s not difficult to do it, if you see the logic behind it.

511
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:34,619
Now as I told you, it takes about 10-15 minutes that’s all.

512
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:37,527
All those who want to do it can do it.

513
00:38:37,597 --> 00:38:40,489
Those who don’t want it, I cannot force,

514
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,951
so they should leave.

515
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,510
There are very simple things,

516
00:38:45,931 --> 00:38:47,570
for which people object.

517
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:53,400
Now I don’t know if it’s too much to do, but if you can take out your shoes,

518
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,833
it helps a lot. This Mother Earth helps us.

519
00:38:56,704 --> 00:39:00,643
She is a living body and she sucks in our problems.

520
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:03,393
She sucks in our heat.

521
00:39:03,463 --> 00:39:09,025
So I will be thankful, if you could take out your shoes and keep them away.

522
00:39:10,675 --> 00:39:15,025
Even this could be a too much condition for the Western people sometimes, in England.

523
00:39:19,646 --> 00:39:24,083
It’s not so cold also, you can keep your socks on.

524
00:39:24,103 --> 00:39:25,072
Now!

525
00:39:28,393 --> 00:39:31,329
You are quite comfortable and sit comfortably.

526
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,072
You don’t have to stand on your heads.

527
00:39:34,132 --> 00:39:36,413
You don’t have to go to Himalayas,

528
00:39:36,463 --> 00:39:39,842
nothing. No starvation, no fasting, nothing,

529
00:39:39,902 --> 00:39:44,719
it’s something inside. It has nothing to do with your outside behaviour

530
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:50,610
and surprisingly it’s all there, intact.

531
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:55,686
If of course if you are suffering from some disease,

532
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:59,257
may be you have been to some guru, who has harmed you, or something,

533
00:39:59,317 --> 00:40:03,949
then maybe it may not work out, but that’s one percent.

534
00:40:03,942 --> 00:40:08,402
But even those, who do not get Realisation, can get it later on

535
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:11,590
and there are Sahaja Yogis who can give you Realisation.

536
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,469
There is no problem on that.

537
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:20,076
You are here means, you have already entered in to the Kingdom of the God,

538
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:24,815
that you desire to have your Self-Realisation is the biggest thing.

539
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:26,675
Now,

540
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:31,967
what we have to do, is to put both the hands like this towards me,

541
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:36,302
comfortably, again very comfortably, you can

542
00:40:36,306 --> 00:40:39,822
if you have the hand rest, you can put it on the hand rest,

543
00:40:39,827 --> 00:40:43,333
or like this both the hands towards me.

544
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:46,282
Now, these are two powers,

545
00:40:46,282 --> 00:40:55,563
Alright now, will you go ahead a little bit there and show them, because everybody should see. I think it's better now.

546
00:40:55,672 --> 00:40:57,733
Can you see him all of you?

547
00:40:59,603 --> 00:41:00,902
Alright,

548
00:41:02,387 --> 00:41:03,143
So

549
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:04,963
ha... now better.

550
00:41:06,713 --> 00:41:09,034
Now you put both the  hands like this,

551
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:17,143
as these two powers are different, we have put both the feet apart from each other.

552
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:24,222
Now please put your right hand on your heart.

553
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:29,992
And we will now show you, what we will have to do.

554
00:41:29,992 --> 00:41:34,431
In the Heart resides the Spirit,

555
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:37,619
that’s the reflection of God Almighty.

556
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:45,635
If you become the Spirit you become your own Master.

557
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,255
So you take down your right hand

558
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:53,014
on the lower portion of the abdomen,

559
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:56,518
on the left hand side. We are just working on the left hand side

560
00:41:57,909 --> 00:42:02,710
and here is the centre of your Mastery,

561
00:42:05,454 --> 00:42:09,152
which is created by great masters and prophets,

562
00:42:09,143 --> 00:42:11,264
which you have to awaken.

563
00:42:11,704 --> 00:42:15,085
Now please take your right hand, on the lower portion of your abdomen,

564
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:18,494
on the left side again.

565
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:25,565
Surprisingly, this is the centre of Pure Divine Knowledge.

566
00:42:27,355 --> 00:42:31,362
You’ll later on know how it works. It’s very interesting.

567
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:37,027
Now raise your hand again, in the upper portion of your abdomen.

568
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,688
Please.

569
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:43,862
And then, raise your right hand on your Heart again.

570
00:42:45,592 --> 00:42:49,251
Now put right your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

571
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:52,210
and turn head to the your right.

572
00:42:52,262 --> 00:42:58,862
This is the centre, I have told you, when you are guilty it is caught and how it is dangerous.

573
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:05,891
Now, take your right hand on top of your forehead across

574
00:43:05,942 --> 00:43:07,351
and put down your head.

575
00:43:07,742 --> 00:43:13,501
This is the centre for forgiving others.

576
00:43:17,871 --> 00:43:20,552
Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head.

577
00:43:20,572 --> 00:43:23,452
Push back your head. These are all the centres.

578
00:43:23,442 --> 00:43:26,702
Now this centre is very important

579
00:43:26,822 --> 00:43:29,922
without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

580
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:35,438
for your satisfaction, you will have to ask for forgiveness from this All-Pervading Power.

581
00:43:36,538 --> 00:43:39,038
Then, please stretch your palm, fully,

582
00:43:39,978 --> 00:43:42,447
stretch your palm. It's the last centre,

583
00:43:42,547 --> 00:43:47,507
which is on the fontanel bone area.

584
00:43:47,597 --> 00:43:52,956
So put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area,

585
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:56,416
which may be hot, which may be cool.

586
00:43:56,436 --> 00:44:00,088
Now push back your fingers. This is important.

587
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:06,369
Please push back your fingers, so there is good pressure on your scalp.

588
00:44:06,378 --> 00:44:10,239
Please bend your head as far as possible

589
00:44:10,297 --> 00:44:15,099
and now move your right hand fully,

590
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:21,485
moving the scalp with the pressure seven times.

591
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:25,440
Please bend your head that’s important.

592
00:44:29,965 --> 00:44:31,775
That’s all we have to do.

593
00:44:33,983 --> 00:44:39,713
Now again please close your eyes

594
00:44:39,824 --> 00:44:42,454
and you will have to open them till I tell you.

595
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:49,101
But before that, see that your both the legs or feet are apart from each other.

596
00:44:49,112 --> 00:44:54,353
Left hand is on your lap or comfortably put toward me like this.

597
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:58,543
And now put your right hand on your heart.

598
00:44:59,632 --> 00:45:02,913
You can take out your spectacles. It will help you,

599
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:07,295
moreover, till I tell you, please don’t open your eyes.

600
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:16,554
Now close your eyes, slowly, not with pressure, but slowly, delicately.

601
00:45:17,543 --> 00:45:21,039
Now, don’t worry about where your thoughts are,

602
00:45:21,108 --> 00:45:23,199
what you have to do, concentrate, nothing.

603
00:45:23,277 --> 00:45:26,563
Kundalini will do all the job. You just leave it alone.

604
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:42,518
Now here is the centre of your Spirit,

605
00:45:45,226 --> 00:45:50,635
so here you have to ask a fundamental question about yourself to me.

606
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:54,806
You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji.

607
00:45:54,876 --> 00:45:57,976
So please ask a question,

608
00:45:58,067 --> 00:46:03,460
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

609
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:05,572
Please ask the question in your heart

610
00:46:05,601 --> 00:46:09,291
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Three times!

611
00:46:17,831 --> 00:46:26,516
I have told you, that if you become the Spirit, you become your Master,

612
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:30,760
because in the light of your Spirit, you know what is to be done.

613
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:32,989
Your Spirit guides you.

614
00:46:34,485 --> 00:46:37,789
So now please take your right hand

615
00:46:37,797 --> 00:46:44,853
on the left-hand side of your abdomen in the upper part and press it.

616
00:46:44,862 --> 00:46:49,222
Here you ask me another question about yourself,

617
00:46:49,313 --> 00:46:52,202
three times in your heart,

618
00:46:52,282 --> 00:46:58,860
“Mother, am I my own Master?”

619
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,260
“Mother, am I my own Master?”

620
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:19,208
I have already told you, that I respect your freedom

621
00:47:19,228 --> 00:47:23,744
and this Pure Knowledge cannot be given to you,

622
00:47:23,804 --> 00:47:25,054
with force,

623
00:47:25,056 --> 00:47:27,027
so you have to ask for it.

624
00:47:28,527 --> 00:47:35,166
So please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

625
00:47:35,175 --> 00:47:39,346
and ask six times,

626
00:47:39,405 --> 00:47:42,518
because this centre has got six petals.

627
00:47:45,438 --> 00:47:50,507
“Mother, please give me Pure Divine Knowledge.”

628
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:56,052
You have to ask for it. I cannot force on you. Please ask six times.

629
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:08,998
As soon as you ask for Pure Knowledge,

630
00:48:09,018 --> 00:48:11,411
the Kundalini starts rising

631
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,572
like a plumule in a seed

632
00:48:13,652 --> 00:48:22,023
and is going upward now, so we have to help the higher chakras with our self confidence.

633
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,536
So now please put your right hand

634
00:48:27,876 --> 00:48:31,643
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

635
00:48:31,677 --> 00:48:38,561
and here you have to say with full confidence,

636
00:48:40,161 --> 00:48:42,541
because this is the centre of your Mastery.

637
00:48:43,972 --> 00:48:47,858
“Mother, I am my own Master."

638
00:48:47,918 --> 00:48:55,018
Please say it ten times, “Mother, I am my own Master.”

639
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:08,001
Now,

640
00:49:08,092 --> 00:49:13,731
please raise your right hand on the heart.

641
00:49:27,021 --> 00:49:31,884
I have already told you, that you are the Pure Spirit.

642
00:49:34,818 --> 00:49:38,297
You are not this body, this mind, these conditionings,

643
00:49:38,338 --> 00:49:41,494
this ego, these emotions,

644
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:45,371
but you are the Pure Spirit.

645
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:50,442
So now here you ask twelve times.

646
00:49:53,882 --> 00:49:57,626
You have to say with full confidence, twelve times

647
00:49:59,846 --> 00:50:02,916
“Mother, I am the Pure Spirit.”

648
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:10,849
“Mother, I am the Pure Spirit.”

649
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:18,614
I have already told you,

650
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:21,005
that if you feel guilty

651
00:50:21,056 --> 00:50:23,364
and you don’t forgive yourself,

652
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:30,021
you develop a problem for your left Vishuddhi,

653
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:33,061
which is very dangerous for your health,

654
00:50:33,121 --> 00:50:35,771
as well as for your Self Realisation.

655
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:39,579
So at this moment, you have to forgive yourself fully.

656
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:49,666
So now raise your right hand in the left corner of your neck and shoulder

657
00:50:49,677 --> 00:50:53,597
and put your head to your right.

658
00:50:55,556 --> 00:51:01,914
Here you have to say sixteen times, with full confidence in yourself.

659
00:51:01,918 --> 00:51:08,043
“Mother, I am not guilty at all.” Please say it sixteen times.

660
00:51:08,047 --> 00:51:11,967
Have faith in yourself, just say I tell you are not guilty,

661
00:51:12,047 --> 00:51:15,217
you are human beings and human beings can commit mistakes.

662
00:51:15,288 --> 00:51:20,748
You are not gods, so please say it with full confidence sixteen times.

663
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,753
Most intricate part is that,

664
00:51:29,764 --> 00:51:35,463
you have to forgive every one without thinking about them, in general.

665
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,215
If you don’t forgive,

666
00:51:38,206 --> 00:51:41,456
then this chakra will be completely constricted

667
00:51:41,525 --> 00:51:43,766
and the Kundalini won’t rise.

668
00:51:44,326 --> 00:51:48,806
All your life you have tortured yourself, by not forgiving others

669
00:51:48,864 --> 00:51:54,315
and now at this moment, if you don’t forgive this centre won’t open at all,

670
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:57,476
so you will miss again your Self Realisation.

671
00:51:57,545 --> 00:52:01,652
You have to ask forgiveness from this All-Pervading Power,

672
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:03,681
just for your satisfaction.

673
00:52:04,442 --> 00:52:06,871
Don’t count your mistakes please.

674
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:11,751
Don’t feel guilty in any way.

675
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:15,231
Now put your right hand on the back side of your head

676
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:18,331
and push back your head as far as possible

677
00:52:21,001 --> 00:52:22,726
and here you have to say,

678
00:52:27,315 --> 00:52:36,239
“Oh Divine Power, if I have done anything knowingly or unknowingly,

679
00:52:38,369 --> 00:52:43,244
something that is wrong, please forgive me.”

680
00:52:43,253 --> 00:52:45,847
This also you have to say from your heart,

681
00:52:45,842 --> 00:52:51,333
not how many times counting or anything, but from your heart you have to say.

682
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:04,746
Some people find it difficult to forgive themselves

683
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:09,275
and some people find it difficult to forgive others.

684
00:53:19,626 --> 00:53:22,637
Now stretch your palm

685
00:53:22,688 --> 00:53:29,505
fully, put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area

686
00:53:30,376 --> 00:53:33,405
and push back your fingers.

687
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:39,896
Now, please bend your head.

688
00:53:41,407 --> 00:53:45,956
Again at this centre, I cannot force Self-Realisation on you.

689
00:53:46,007 --> 00:53:48,487
You have ask for it.

690
00:53:48,509 --> 00:53:51,958
So, please move you hands seven times.

691
00:53:52,047 --> 00:53:55,467
Please put down your head. Please put down your head.

692
00:53:55,478 --> 00:54:01,599
Please move your scalp with your hand,

693
00:54:01,601 --> 00:54:04,487
with a pressure, because you have pushed back your fingers,

694
00:54:04,472 --> 00:54:09,007
seven times, slowly, clock wise, saying,

695
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:12,376
“Mother, please give me Self Realisation.”

696
00:54:13,878 --> 00:54:15,757
You have to say it,

697
00:54:15,768 --> 00:54:21,088
unless or until you ask for it, I cannot force it on you, so please say it.

698
00:55:09,476 --> 00:55:13,076
Now please take down your hands.

699
00:55:13,155 --> 00:55:16,045
Please open your eyes, slowly.

700
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:24,661
Put both the hands towards me, like this.

701
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,811
Now

702
00:55:33,487 --> 00:55:36,773
put your right hand towards me like this

703
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:42,362
and with the left hand, you bend your head and see for yourself,

704
00:55:42,431 --> 00:55:48,202
if there is cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

705
00:55:50,793 --> 00:55:53,556
Could be hot if you have not forgiven.

706
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:56,327
Don’t put the hand on top of your head.

707
00:55:56,327 --> 00:55:59,389
So away from it and move your hand.

708
00:55:59,396 --> 00:56:03,978
Sometimes it can be very close, or it can be far away.

709
00:56:03,978 --> 00:56:11,027
So please bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool, or a hot breeze like sensation

710
00:56:11,097 --> 00:56:14,893
coming from the fontanel bone area and don’t doubt.

711
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:17,563
May be you might think it’s air conditioning and all that,

712
00:56:17,632 --> 00:56:19,612
but there is no air conditioning in your head.

713
00:56:19,632 --> 00:56:21,972
So, see it if for yourself, nicely.

714
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,498
Now,

715
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:28,681
please put your left hand towards me and put the right hand... now

716
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:33,947
you see if there is cool breeze or a hot breeze like sensation,

717
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,577
coming out of your head.

718
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:37,938
Now,

719
00:56:37,931 --> 00:56:43,181
turn your hand on all the sides.

720
00:56:43,273 --> 00:56:46,489
You can also see if some people get it very far.

721
00:56:46,512 --> 00:56:49,032
Some people get it like a jet out.

722
00:56:49,103 --> 00:56:54,012
Some it is closer to the head. It depends on the personality of a person.

723
00:56:55,603 --> 00:56:57,793
Alright. Now have another one,

724
00:56:57,893 --> 00:57:02,666
right one, right hand last, lastly.

725
00:57:02,755 --> 00:57:05,965
Please put your left hand now, bend your head

726
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:12,014
and see for yourself, there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

727
00:57:13,873 --> 00:57:18,443
It’s little further also you can see clearly, if there is.<br>

728
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:21,534
Now,

729
00:57:25,364 --> 00:57:29,255
please put both the hands towards the sky

730
00:57:29,315 --> 00:57:36,860
and push back your head and here you have to ask a question.

731
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:41,141
Any one of these questions, you can ask three times.

732
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:48,639
The first question is, you can say is, “Is this the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love?”

733
00:57:48,777 --> 00:57:53,599
“Mother, is this is the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love?”

734
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,110
Second question could be,

735
00:57:58,018 --> 00:58:01,829
“Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

736
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:06,889
Third question could be, “Mother is this the Brahma Chaitanya?”

737
00:58:06,898 --> 00:58:11,059
Ask any one of these questions three times.

738
00:58:16,485 --> 00:58:18,510
Now bring down the hands

739
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,250
and put both the hands towards me and watch me without thinking.

740
00:58:33,396 --> 00:58:38,737
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their fingertips,

741
00:58:38,817 --> 00:58:40,739
or on their palms,

742
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:46,039
or out of their fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in childhood,

743
00:58:46,047 --> 00:58:49,478
please raise both your hands.

744
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:56,635
Every one of you!

745
00:58:56,706 --> 00:59:00,590
May God bless you Sydney people. I am so happy.

746
00:59:00,661 --> 00:59:02,501
May God bless you.

747
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,916
Now keep it up.

748
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,471
You have to come to the collective and keep it up, and know the knowledge, all of it.

749
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:10,800
Can I see this side?

750
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,860
All of you got it?

751
00:59:12,931 --> 00:59:15,380
Oh my God!

752
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:18,981
It’s remarkable.

753
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:20,684
This side also?

754
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:26,989
It’s really remarkable. May God bless you.

755
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:28,710
It’s tremendous.

756
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:31,226
Some didn’t get, very, very few.

757
00:59:31,326 --> 00:59:35,614
One here, one there,

758
00:59:35,675 --> 00:59:42,697
so they can also come later on, on the stage and Sahaja Yogis will give them Realisation.

759
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:47,157
No problem, but we will have one song just before I leave.

760
00:59:47,268 --> 00:59:49,538
I hope you will keep sitting till then

761
00:59:49,617 --> 00:59:53,262
and you can also clap, so your hands become more active.

762
00:59:53,262 --> 00:59:59,983
Some song that will give you nice clapping rhythm, which one?

763
01:00:37,025 --> 01:00:38,510
You put your hand like this.

764
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:42,480
It will increase with the songs. You'll feel the Cool Breeze increase with the songs.

765
01:00:58,869 --> 01:01:01,179
Now just feel your vibrations

766
01:01:01,289 --> 01:01:05,585
just feel with this clapping, how they have improved or not.

767
01:01:08,849 --> 01:01:09,795
Alright!

768
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,786
It's much better, the flow.
