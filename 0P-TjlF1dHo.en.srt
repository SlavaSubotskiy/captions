1
00:00:12,329 --> 00:01:12,139
Today we have decided to celebrate the Buddha
Jayanti, it's the day of Buddha's birth.

2
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:29,060
In the whole
map of time, Buddha came to this earth at

3
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,320
a time when it was so important for Him to
come.

4
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:57,240
That time, especially in India, we had two
types of people: one, who were very ritualistic,

5
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:18,260
trying to be extremely strict and disciplined;
and the another were the people who were

6
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:29,819
too much conditioned and were full of so-called
devotion to God.

7
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:46,610
So these two types of people were occupying
the area of seekers.

8
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:57,879
So it was necessary to neutralize these two
styles of seekings.

9
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:15,250
Buddha and Mahavira are, in essence, supported
by Hanumana and Bhairava - that is, as you

10
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,790
know, Gabriel and Saint Michael.

11
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:32,890
The principle that took birth is the principle
of a disciple, and this principle was born

12
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:40,470
much earlier as the two sons of Shri Rama.

13
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:53,390
This principle was brought on this earth and
incarnated: one, to conquer the ego of human

14
00:03:53,390 --> 00:04:01,879
beings; another one, to conquer the superego
of human beings.

15
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:11,939
Buddha, when He was born, He found that there
was misery everywhere.

16
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:20,970
And the misery, according to Him, was due
to the desires we have.

17
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:27,990
So to be desireless is the best way to achieve
Nirvana.

18
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,660
That's what He came to conclusion.

19
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,810
But how to become desireless?

20
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:44,990
You are sitting in the sand, and if you see,
the sand doesn't get attached to anything.

21
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,970
You put anything on it, it will not spoil
anything.

22
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:57,590
You put water, it will stick on, and as soon
as you try to throw it away the whole thing

23
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,100
will disappear into thin air.

24
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:21,850
So to develop that kind of detachment, or
to develop a life which was desireless was

25
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:23,479
His aim.

26
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:27,940
And that's why I say He was a Disciple Principles.

27
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:40,280
So, the Disciple Principle has to find out
the way and method, while the Guru Principle

28
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,729
are the people who have already found out.

29
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:47,940
Because He has to create a way and path.

30
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:54,670
So, He studied all kinds of books, went to
many places.

31
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,860
He read Upanishadas.

32
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:03,889
Then He saw the people who are busy with Vedas
and were doing all kinds of ritualism.

33
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:16,530
With the rituals, they never got the Realization,
which is actually the first verse of Veda

34
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:24,569
is that, "By reading the Vedas and by doing
all the rituals of the Vedas, if you do not

35
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:33,229
become vida, means self-realized, vida word
means "to know", if you don't know the Divine

36
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:42,139
on your central nervous system, then you are
just missing the point.

37
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:45,600
It is all useless for you to read Vedas.

38
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,979
So He went into various areas of search.

39
00:06:52,979 --> 00:07:04,720
As today we find many seekers have been going
to many people to find out the truth.

40
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,810
And He was tired, very tired.

41
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:19,160
He thought all His seeking, all His working
hard, all His efforts, everything had just

42
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,460
made Him tired.

43
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,860
And He thought it was all fruitless.

44
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:40,949
So, He was lying under a Banyan tree, and
there the Adi Shakti gave Him Realization.

45
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:53,260
When all your searches are over - people search
in money, in power, in love, and all kinds

46
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,260
of things.

47
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:03,370
Ultimately people start searching in various
groups, cults, gurus, all kinds of things

48
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:09,550
- drugs, alcohol's, whichever way are possible
they try to search.

49
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:16,030
But when human beings try to search something,
then in their movement they either go to the

50
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,680
left or to the right.

51
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:29,229
And He, being such an ardent seeker, and such
a truthful seeker, He could see very clearly

52
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:33,680
that this is not the point of going left or
right.

53
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,770
But there has to be some ascent, but how to
achieve it?

54
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,760
Who is going to give Him Self-Realization?

55
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:51,100
All that tiredness He laid down Himself under
the tree and suddenly He got His Realization.

56
00:08:51,100 --> 00:09:04,750
When He got His Realization, He started understanding
why this problem of conditioning and ego is

57
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,750
there.

58
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:15,550
He found out one thing: that people when they
read too much, and try to understand - through

59
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,690
ritualism - God, then they develop their ego.

60
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:27,030
The other side, He found out, that when people
just with some desires, go on praying to God,

61
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:33,450
"Give me this, give me that", they become
mad.

62
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:42,020
And when He realized it, then only at that
moment when He was tired, He got His Realization.

63
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:48,000
This is exactly what is happening today in
the modern times.

64
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,700
That those who were seekers have been seeking
the Divine on the left and right hand side.

65
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,320
Nowadays they are jogging.

66
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,550
I don't know what they're going to achieve
through jogging.

67
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,060
They're jogging like mad.

68
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:14,280
Then there are ardent Christians, ardent Muslims,
fighting the whole world for their religion,

69
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:20,700
for their God, for in the name of Mohammed
Sahib, in the name of Krishna, in the name

70
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,860
of everything.

71
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,810
Then they think their religion is in danger.

72
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,600
I mean it is not.

73
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:39,000
Neither the prophets nor the incarnations,
nobody is in danger, not at all.

74
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,100
How can they be?

75
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,460
And no religion if it is true religion can
be in danger.

76
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,520
But this He only realized after His Realization.

77
00:10:52,520 --> 00:11:01,890
But His followers who came did not see the
point that ultimately it is Self-Realization

78
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,030
He is talking.

79
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:09,670
Actually he took all the care to see that
people should get their Self-Realization first.

80
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,960
Then anything else.

81
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,430
First of all He said, "You are not going to
worship Me."

82
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:26,630
As you know we don't allow people to come
for My Puja unless and until they are fully

83
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,420
established in Sahaja Yoga.

84
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:36,240
So He first said that, "You should be fully
established in your Self-Realization, that's

85
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,680
all."

86
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:46,910
He would not talk about God, because once
you start talking about God, then He saw all

87
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,440
these horrible religions coming up in the
name of God.

88
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:57,920
When I first came to America, you will be
surprised, I did not talk of God, I did not

89
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,090
talk of bhoots, I did not talk of any religion.

90
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,660
I just talked about Self-Realization.

91
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:15,000
The reason was, I thought, if you get your
Self-Realization then you'll understand the

92
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:28,510
rest of it, but no use talking to you -

93
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:38,190
about God or about Divine because first thing
is you must have your eyes, you must have

94
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,640
the light, otherwise what's the use of talking
about these things.

95
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,960
But it so happened that Buddha did not give
anybody Realization.

96
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:54,980
So it was all right for Him to talk about
the Spirit and not about God or any religion,

97
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:01,190
to such an extent that people say that Buddha
was an atheist - He did not believe in God.

98
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:10,060
No, it was a matter of His policy that He
did not want to talk about God.

99
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:19,680
But what I found when I came to America that
this world is full of all kinds of things.

100
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,680
Firstly the tremendous ego that they have.

101
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,870
And secondly they are so much conditioned.

102
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:40,390
There were so many witchcrafts and forces,
I mean openly they are saying, "This is a

103
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,590
witchcraft's school."

104
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,590
Openly.

105
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,410
Or, "This is a satanic powers school."

106
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,160
All kinds, I was surprised, openly saying
like that.

107
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,500
And when I came to San Diego first, because
I came on My own, and the people who invited

108
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:04,610
Me had an organization called "parapsychology"
- is all bhoots.

109
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:11,750
So they took Me round in a huge, big hall
and there were lots of people sitting down

110
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,270
and I saw all the bhoots.

111
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,140
(Shri Mataji laughing) I said, "Now what should
I do?

112
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,140
Should I say the truth or not?

113
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,160
They might start getting angry with Me."

114
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,920
But I said, "Better to tell them, because
once they are lost in the bhoots, then what

115
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,660
will I do with them?"

116
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,070
So I told them, "This is all wrong, this is
all bhootish, it is all nonsense, you just

117
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:40,960
don't fall a prey to all these things, this
is not correct, you better get your Realization!"

118
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:46,220
And see, some people did get Realization,
and some people did leave that organization.

119
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:58,160
Now, last time when I came I discovered in
'83 that the lady who was in charge sort of

120
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:09,640
a person, has become mad and the gentleman
who was organizing all that has become bankrupt

121
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:13,939
and has gone to Australia and the building
has collapsed.

122
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,020
The bhoots must have done the job.

123
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:27,710
It was such a problem for Me in those days
to talk against all this nonsense.

124
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,710
Then I went to some churches, they invited
Me.

125
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:35,840
Now, in the church suddenly I found eight
or ten bhootish people got up and started

126
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
dancing.

127
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,700
I said, "Where am I now?"

128
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:47,380
(Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) I am here to
tell them about the Spirit and see the condition

129
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,380
here.

130
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:55,180
What am I to tell them and they ardently
believed that I was an agent of God, of course,

131
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,440
but God meaning bhoot.

132
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,920
It was impossible to understand how far people
have gone.

133
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:12,960
At the same time there was an onslaught of
all the fake gurus at that time and when I

134
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,420
said, "You cannot pay for it" they said, "You
better go back.

135
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,240
We don't want you."

136
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,990
So I went away and then came back after nine
years.

137
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:36,830
So Buddha tried to talk only about Self-Realization
and not about God at all.

138
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:46,160
But His followers as they are always one better
than the other, tried to create a Buddhism

139
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,380
of their own style.

140
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:54,849
And in this Buddhism, whatever He had told,
they did not observe it.

141
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:01,140
Firstly He thought if there is ritualism and
puja an all that, before Realization where

142
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,600
will they land up?

143
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:12,280
So He said, "All right, you do not do any
puja to Me!

144
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,679
Do not built any monument in My name!

145
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,510
You should not worship anything!"

146
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,810
So what did they do?

147
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:29,340
They are worshipping His teeth, they are worshipping
His nails, they are worshipping His hair.

148
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:40,730
Now say, for example, if you get My hair and
you are not a Realized Soul, what is the difference

149
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,930
between My hair or anybody's hair?

150
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,620
Just the same.

151
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:51,950
Without Realization all this worship took
them to very bhootish area.

152
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:58,070
That's how we find the Buddhists who are nowhere
near Buddha.

153
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,750
Like if you go to Japan, you can't believe
they can be Buddhist.

154
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:09,100
They are supposed to be Buddhist - Buddha
who is the compassionate.

155
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:16,350
Then we have got Chinese who followed Buddhism.

156
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,650
They couldn't understand Buddhism either.

157
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:27,310
And we have Tibetans where we had these horrible
lamas and we had other people in Ladakh and

158
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,310
all that.

159
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:35,060
They are all doing nothing else but bhoot-vidya,
prita-vidya, smashaan vidya.

160
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:40,890
So even His advent amounted to the same thing
as everybody's.

161
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:51,270
Now Buddha told three things which are very
important, which are very useful for Sahaja

162
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,880
Yogis to follow.

163
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:02,760
He said, "Buddham Sharanam Gachami.

164
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:08,920
- I surrender myself to the enlightened one."

165
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,990
Means what?

166
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,900
I surrender myself to the one who is enlightened.

167
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,590
In this case one can say it was Buddha.

168
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,350
In your case it is your Spirit.

169
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,540
You surrender yourself to your Spirit.

170
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,260
"Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

171
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,770
Buddha means the one which knows.

172
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:42,020
Then He says another thing, "Dhammam Sharanam
Gachami" means surrender yourself to the religion,

173
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,110
which is true religion, which is the balance.

174
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:55,820
Now as you see, all these man-made religions
are so funny and you can't make much out of

175
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820
them.

176
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:02,980
You can't explain if these are religions or these
are Mafias.

177
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:14,690
The reason is, Buddha said, "You surrender
yourselves to Dharma."

178
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:21,040
So the Buddhist thought, "surrender to Dharma"
means what you have to do is to become like

179
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:28,790
Buddhist - means wear a dress like a Buddhist,
like Buddha used to wear.

180
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:34,480
You don't become by wearing that dress Buddha,
do you?

181
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,050
Or then they thought, "We should do something
more."

182
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:46,960
So some Buddhist got hold of a wheel, because
He talked of a wheel-of-life and all that.

183
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:54,539
Absolutely, I should say, very unintelligent
way of understanding Buddha.

184
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:58,600
And they would go on, you see, moving that
wheel like mad.

185
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,090
You can't talk to them.

186
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,010
You say, "Now, where is that road?"

187
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,010
"Buddha."

188
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,500
(Laughter) "How do we go there?"

189
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,710
(Laughter) Everything has an answer.

190
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,560
So I said, "Please answer Me."

191
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,130
"This is the answer."

192
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:25,220
So what is this answer going on?

193
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,990
Then these people thought we should find out
new methods.

194
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:39,280
So some of them took to again Upanishadas
and started using also from there, making

195
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:48,040
jataka kathas like the stories which are very
absurd, funny stories, mysterious stories,

196
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,280
this story, that story.

197
00:21:51,280 --> 00:22:04,150
At the same time Hinduism took another funny
role and they had a big assault of tantrikas.

198
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:14,600
And when the tantrikas came in they brought
all kinds of ugly, horrible things in the

199
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:21,780
- say about the sixth century it started.

200
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:34,370
And a complete belt starting beyond Calcutta
going towards Dwarika, complete belt got involved

201
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,410
into tantrism.

202
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:42,120
So the same Buddhist later on, followed the
same tantric methods.

203
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:50,020
So they tried to bring in everything from
this place, that place and a mixture, so now

204
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:56,750
if you ask, "Now what's your religion?" they
say, "I'm Buddhist."

205
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,970
"What Buddhist?"

206
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,800
- "Dinayan, hinayan,

207
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:05,300
I'm Zen - this, that, all kinds of Buddhism is
there.

208
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,720
Is impossible to understand really where is
Buddhism there.

209
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,830
So what do these do?

210
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,890
One will shave their hair.

211
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,950
One will shave their moustache.

212
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,340
Another one will wear this kind of a dress.

213
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,630
(Shri Mataji laughing) This is the only difference
between from one to another.

214
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:29,430
But the common point is that they are all
cheats, they all can deceive you, they can

215
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,430
tell lies without feeling funny.

216
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:35,650
They are very sly, very cunning and suicidal.

217
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:44,810
They can be very violent and the only desire
they have is to kill everybody who comes across.

218
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:52,680
This is where Buddha's Buddhism has ended
up.

219
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:58,530
So now we are face to face with Buddha.

220
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:05,480
But what He talked about was a spontaneous
happening of Self-Realization.

221
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,440
And He said, "You prepare yourself."

222
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:15,059
All the time He said, "You prepare yourself
for Self-Realization and try to watch everything

223
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,059
without desire."

224
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:21,230
This was just preparation for Sahaja Yoga
He was talking about.

225
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:35,980
But as you see, all the Buddhists today, if
you see them you'll be amazed that they are

226
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,620
neither here nor there.

227
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:43,070
You just don't know how to place them, how
to understand them, how to make them feel

228
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,750
what Buddha taught or Zen has taught.

229
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:50,140
They are not in a condition to understand
anything.

230
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:59,690
It's like, you see, the brain of a person
who is having all kinds of thoughts, like

231
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,530
all the pebbles in one little pot, making
noise.

232
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:08,270
God knows which one is making which noise.

233
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:15,000
And that's why today you find here is one
Lama, who was a guru of Hitler.

234
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,490
Imagine: Hitler's guru was Lama!

235
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:24,100
Now this mister Lama is going round the whole
world with his wrinkles which can be counted

236
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,720
one by one and asking for money.

237
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,270
Why does he want money for?

238
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:39,380
He is the one who ran away from Tibet, from
Lhasa.

239
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,590
And while running away he carried such a lot
of gold with him that he could not carry.

240
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:48,730
So half of it he dropped it in the river and
with the half of it he reached India.

241
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:55,240
With the half of it already he has made a
huge, big Buddha of gold, he has too much

242
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,440
gold with him.

243
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:05,970
And the rest of the gold that was salvaged,
was taken to Russia - to China, where I've

244
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,600
seen it Myself.

245
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
Amazed.

246
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:16,319
He had gold, beer mugs, what you call
them, the huge, big things, like that.

247
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,680
Real gold.

248
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,690
And such big plates of real gold for eating
food.

249
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,690
Imagine!

250
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:32,740
Buddha talked of detachment, and they had
everything in gold or silver of a very expensive

251
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,460
quality.

252
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,930
If you see their robe, clothes and all that
you'd be amazed.

253
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:46,250
Though they wore all those things as robes
of renunciation, but whenever they sat in

254
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:54,529
their own courtyard - courts and things like
that, inside all that they wore - inside wore

255
00:26:54,730 --> 00:27:02,920
all those dresses which were very heavily
done with real gold, with pearls and things,

256
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,400
because I've seen with My own eyes.

257
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,550
I was amazed.

258
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,370
So it is like somebody who says, "Oh, I must
get detached.

259
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:17,230
Now I'm going to the seashore.

260
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,470
I'm going to sit there and meditate."

261
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,890
There he goes, and makes a compound round
himself.

262
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:28,550
So I ask him, "Why have you made a compound?", "You
know, maybe thieves might come in."

263
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:33,230
I mean you are detached what does it matter
if a thief comes, he will take you away, so

264
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,230
what?

265
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,610
You are there, doesn't matter, you can go
with a thief, you can go with anyone.

266
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,370
Why are you worried about the thief?

267
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,680
You are detached.

268
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,380
"Oh, you see, I am also worried that there
might be pick-pockets."

269
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,930
"So why are you worried about pick-pockets?"

270
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:54,710
"Because maybe I have some money with me here,
and I have my bank account and I have my other, other

271
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:59,049
things with me, so I am rather worried, see,
that a thief might come."

272
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,320
So why do you talk of detachment?

273
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,620
Why do you talk of sanyasa?

274
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:14,580
So this kind of a nonsensical sanyasa started
after Buddha died, which was so very shocking.

275
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:23,580
This led people to think that you can wear
any time an orange dress and then you are

276
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,580
a sanyasi.

277
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,940
If you wear an orange dress you become Buddha,
and you become a detached personality.

278
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:36,240
Now you can announce to the whole world that,
"I'm a detached personality" and what is your

279
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
background?

280
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,679
"Nothing, I just was born out of this Mother
Earth and I'm sitting here nicely like Buddha."

281
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,440
So people stupidly start giving them money.

282
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,809
So they get the money.

283
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:54,070
But actually, the background is that the fellow
might have come out of the jail in India for

284
00:28:54,070 --> 00:29:00,900
burglary or something like that, and now sitting
down here as Buddha.

285
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,260
How will you make out?

286
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:08,540
"Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

287
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:14,570
So what we have to do is to establish ourselves
in Buddha.

288
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,250
That is to establish within ourselves in our
Spirit.

289
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:27,960
Unless and until we are established in our
Spirit, we cannot understand the intricacies

290
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,800
of all the ignorance that we have around.

291
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:40,530
So the best way to understand Sahaja Yoga
is to establish yourself in the Spirit.

292
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:49,290
But those who are not intelligent, those who
are stupid, those who are selfish and greedy

293
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,790
do not see this point.

294
00:29:52,790 --> 00:30:00,110
And they do not like it if a leader tells
them that, "You must establish in Sahaja Yoga,

295
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:03,250
that you should have your Spirit manifested."

296
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,270
They don't want to listen to it.

297
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:11,190
They want to be in the group of Sahaja Yogis
because they don't want to be lonely.

298
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:19,950
They would like to sing songs, music, everything
in Sahaja Yoga because they want somewhere

299
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:26,150
to fit in, because they want an identity,
they call themselves Sahaja Yogis.

300
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:31,200
But this identity is a false identity.

301
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,950
You have to be identified with your Spirit.

302
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,580
That is the part is, "Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

303
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,060
The second is, "Dhammam Sharanam Gachami."

304
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,330
What is "Dhammam", is Dharma.

305
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:51,700
What is our Dharma, is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

306
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,559
That means now we have become universal beings.

307
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:05,130
We are no more Indians, no more Africans,
no more English, no more French.

308
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:19,960
We all have become now Sahaja Yogis who are
the citizens of the Kingdom of God.

309
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,170
We have no other identification.

310
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,780
This is our Dharma.

311
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:32,920
We are now leading a universal life.

312
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:40,070
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

313
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:47,140
Still, so many of them still identify themselves
with some localized stuff.

314
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:56,630
Now when we think of universality we have
to understand, that it's not only the religion

315
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:03,050
or a country that separates us, but also a
kind of a quality.

316
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:10,350
For example, if there are people who are Rajo-gunis
who are very active, right-sided people, they'll

317
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,590
combine together.

318
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,190
They may fight later but they combine.

319
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:22,549
Then the people who are left-sided will combine
together, but both of these should cling onto

320
00:32:22,348 --> 00:32:30,959
those who are trying to ascend, who are in
the center.

321
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,820
And there where we fail very much.

322
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:46,830
Our associations and our understandings of
each other is deluded by our ignorance and

323
00:32:46,830 --> 00:33:00,200
we cannot understand who is for our ascent
and who is for our benevolence.

324
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,020
This happens with us in so many ways.

325
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:10,570
We are universal beings and our culture is
"Sahaja Culture."

326
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:13,690
We have given up all our nonsensical cultures.

327
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:21,650
In every religion, in every country we have
seen the nonsense of our culture, so we believe

328
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:25,929
in the spontaneous culture of Sahaja Yoga.

329
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:28,860
So we are universal beings.

330
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:38,110
And in this state of being universal being
you have to develop your collective consciousness.

331
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:49,990
As first one is for individual, "Buddham Sharanam
Gacchami" - I surrender myself to Buddha.

332
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:57,300
The second one is the one, I surrender myself
to the collective - in the sense, into the

333
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,860
Dharma, the essence of the collective.

334
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,030
Now what is the essence of our collective?

335
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:11,000
What binds us together is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma,
the Pure Religion of the Universe.

336
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:19,119
So once you understand that this is the thing
that binds you to each other, you must understand

337
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,320
how important it is to keep to Vishwa Nirmala
Dharma.

338
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:32,110
In so many ways I have been able to tell you
what is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

339
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:43,409
So we have to understand the full content
of the Dharma that we are following and also

340
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:50,100
to reflect it back to see, "Are we really
following this religion?"

341
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,090
But in falsehood I have seen like somebody's
a Christian.

342
00:34:54,090 --> 00:35:00,650
Every Sunday he'll get up, dress up nicely,
go to the church, get up three times, four

343
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:05,970
times, sing songs, this thing, do everything,
pay the money to the priest, pay to the church,

344
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:14,430
pay to that, and then he thinks he has done
the job.

345
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,470
Very religiously he'll go and confess.

346
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:22,640
Muslims, very religiously will do some things
which we cannot really understand.

347
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:30,160
As in Spain I was told that people try
to crucify themselves, as a drama of course,

348
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:38,890
but they do it just to protect Christianity
I think, and to crucify - God knows what!

349
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:46,710
Then there are people in India who are following
Hinduism and the first principle, the basic

350
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,910
principle of Hinduism, that there is Spirit
in everyone.

351
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:55,890
So how can you have caste and subcaste and this and that?

352
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:59,760
If everybody has the Spirit you can't have
caste, subcaste.

353
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,610
You cannot have division like that.

354
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:10,650
So what we find in every religion, there are
problematic things but once you come to this

355
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:17,369
pure religion, then you see the essence of
it and the essence of it is that, that we

356
00:36:17,369 --> 00:36:24,240
are all Spirit and we are all related to each
other, we are part and parcel of the whole.

357
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,100
So you go to the collective.

358
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,610
So at the end He said, "Sangham Sharanam Gachami."

359
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:34,380
This is the very important point also.

360
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:42,770
It's the most important thing is this "Sangham
Sharanam Gachami."

361
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:50,200
For example, we say that you surrender yourself
to collectivity.

362
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,220
What does that mean?

363
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,680
What does that entail (it is)?

364
00:36:52,680 --> 00:37:03,230
As I was talking to your leaders here, I said,
"All of you should form one collective unit,

365
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,940
a 'Sangham'."

366
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:12,020
All the leaders have to know that they love
Mother from their heart, and they should never

367
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:23,410
try to cut each other because somebody's trying
to tell them against them.

368
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,402
They should have love for each other.

369
00:37:26,402 --> 00:37:28,290
For example there's one Mr. X, who's a leader.

370
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:37,420
Now a negative force incarnates and comes
and tells the leader that, "See the other

371
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,670
leader is my supporter."

372
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:45,510
So this fellow has a bad feeling, the another
leader has another bad feeling.

373
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,220
This is going against "Sangha."

374
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:54,270
First the Sangha of the collectivity of the
leaders has to be fully appreciated.

375
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:59,390
I enjoy the way when all these leaders meet
and beat each other nicely and enjoy each

376
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:08,310
other, pull each other's legs and love each
other and patronize the younger ones and look

377
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,310
after.

378
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,470
That's the beginning of Sangha.

379
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:15,630
If the leaders are not in Sangha, what other
Sangha we can form?

380
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,990
So the first is the Sangha of the leaders
is there.

381
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:25,110
All those who try to break that Sangha must
know that they are negative people and they

382
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:27,669
are going to stab us.

383
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:32,260
Anybody who tries that, you should be very
careful.

384
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:37,490
The second Sangha, collectivity, is among
the Sahaja Yogis.

385
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:46,290
Now we are not, as I told you, Indians, or
we are not English or Americans or anything,

386
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,780
so we should not form groups.

387
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:55,230
What you'll find always, if there are five
Americans they'll stick on to each other as

388
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:58,999
if they have been glued, and they can't move
away from each other.

389
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,590
All of them will be together.

390
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:05,369
If there are Indians, they will stick on together.

391
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:10,690
If there are other kinds, they'll all stick
on together.

392
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,460
Now we are no more that.

393
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,859
It's finished!

394
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:17,080
So what is there to glue to each other?

395
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,430
But it happens.

396
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,910
We always glue to each other.

397
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,300
I don't know why.

398
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,130
What is the need to do that?

399
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:32,620
And very commonly we see that in India people
are behaving in a very funny manner.

400
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:38,730
Last year I did not know, but people told
Me that some group came and they were all

401
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:46,390
the time saying, "We are a great nation, we
are a great nation."

402
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:50,340
They are not Sahaja Yogis.

403
00:39:50,340 --> 00:40:01,060
Our nation is Kingdom of God and our King
is God Almighty and we have no other King

404
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,730
and no other nation.

405
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:14,390
If you cannot transcend those barriers of
stupid limitations you cannot become Sahaja

406
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,590
Yogis.

407
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:18,720
But this is in a very gross way.

408
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:28,700
But in a very subtle way, I see a lady who
is catching or who has badha will immediately

409
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,830
crawl into another one - somehow.

410
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:34,260
She may belong to any country, doesn't matter.

411
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:44,120
You see, a bhootish woman, say, coming from
India, will crawl up to another one in Australia.

412
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:45,659
Straight forward, march!

413
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,360
Just start watching, "Where is she going?

414
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,710
Oh God, that's it!"

415
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:58,190
So the bhoots are very collective, a big fraternity,
great fraternity.

416
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:03,890
If they see somebody who is possessed, this
bhootish person will immediately go to her.

417
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:11,070
It is very surprising that the bhoots are
so collective.

418
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:15,270
Apart from that, they know Me very well.

419
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,210
They understand Me very well.

420
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:24,190
Even a little child if he is caught up will
start crying before Me, shaking before Me,

421
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,980
not coming before Me.

422
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:32,820
But when they are realized, they don't understand
and moreover they don't understand a simple

423
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:38,230
principle that we are now possessed by our
own Spirit and we are one.

424
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:49,470
So they should stick on more to the person
who is a spiritually evolved personality.

425
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:57,490
But instead of that, for them some "third-rater"
something is much more important than a person

426
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:01,480
who is such a highly developed person.

427
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,330
This is where we fail in our collective.

428
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:09,619
A very subtle method of these negative people.

429
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:14,160
Just finding out how to form a big formidable
group to attack.

430
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,720
With that you lose your vibrations.

431
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:27,060
Once you lose your vibrations then you say,
"Oh, this is too much.

432
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,980
We must have compassion.

433
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,950
We must have love.

434
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,800
After all we are all Sahaja Yogis."

435
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,200
So it's the compassion and love of bhoots
among themselves.

436
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,930
They are talking of compassion to each other.

437
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:50,660
Even with Me they said, "Mother, you have
to be kind."

438
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:58,000
I said, "Are you more compassionate than Me
that you are teaching Me?"

439
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:07,830
If I'm saying anything to this lady taking
all My breath and all My energy on her, then

440
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:12,659
I'm doing it for her benevolence and it's
My compassion that is [why/working], but what you

441
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:21,070
are doing is not for the benevolence but for
the destruction of that person.

442
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:27,170
So no use supporting someone who is negative.

443
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:32,470
Many negative persons who have been asked
to get out of Sahaja Yoga sometimes create

444
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:39,430
this problem of coming, "Oh Mother, you know,
I'm so good, but they tortured me, they troubled

445
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:40,580
me so much."

446
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,570
Now I'm seeing a bhoot in the person.

447
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,890
I can clearly see.

448
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:51,810
I can see the negativity, but if you do not
see, you will immediately start taking sides,

449
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:56,750
"Oh God, look at this, poor thing is tortured."

450
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:02,570
You lose your vibrations, you won't be able
to find out!

451
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:07,460
So don't come under the spell of these murmuring
souls, as Christ has called.

452
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:12,610
He said, "Murmuring souls are the greatest
danger."

453
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,520
That I've seen in Sahaja Yoga.

454
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:22,880
Those who murmur, talk at the back, go on
complaining are the greatest danger to Sahaja

455
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,860
Yoga and ultimately to themselves.

456
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,849
Because they'll be found out.

457
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:38,410
So this is the another situation into which
we are not collective and when we are collective,

458
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:46,750
we are collective for something which is not
ascending force.

459
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:59,990
It is something surprising how we see people
in this world are inviting their destruction

460
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:10,000
and we too, in a way, when we don't understand
what is collectivity, try to destroy our body

461
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,810
of Sahaja Yoga.

462
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:21,850
Today I'm telling you this because all these
things must be stopped now on the day of Buddha's

463
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:23,119
birth.

464
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:29,690
Buddha is the one who is in charge of your
ego.

465
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:38,010
If you go beyond Buddha and start showing
off too much, then He pushes your ego into

466
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,640
your left Vishuddhi.

467
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:45,320
So you develop your left Vishuddhi and when
you develop your left Vishuddhi, what happens?

468
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:50,920
That you start feeling guilty, meaning you
do not want to face the situation at all,

469
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,830
but you say "Oh, I'm very guilty.

470
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:58,390
I've killed you, all right, I've killed you,
I'm feeling guilty."

471
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:01,020
We never face the situation.

472
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:06,930
This is the ego which goes into the left and
creates this problem of left Vishuddhi.

473
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:14,280
It's not by any chance your style of bearing
up things, or you are being suppressed.

474
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:25,320
But no, you have been oppressing others, you
have been egoistical and it has been so much

475
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:33,680
that it has gone into the left Vishuddhi.

476
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,790
So you are trying to justify.

477
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:43,820
Now I would suggest that if you really want
to understand Sahaja Yoga, first try to understand

478
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,390
yourself.

479
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:51,890
Then you see, "Where is my mind going now?"

480
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:56,599
Some ladies who are used to, say gossip, they
come to Sahaja Yoga.

481
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:03,530
They are all right, but sometimes that thing
comes, "Let's go and gossip about this lady".

482
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:09,689
They'll just get up, walk on to another one who
must have been gossiped in last life, maybe.

483
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:15,360
So go and talk to that person and tell something
against that person.

484
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:23,380
(Shri Mataji laughing) Then they find out
another gossiper or they get another gossiper.

485
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,980
Now, what I find is three great Sahaja Yoginis
are sitting and gossiping there.

486
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:28,980
I say, "What are you talking?"

487
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:34,080
"Oh, no Mother, we were discussing Sahaja
Yoga."

488
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,010
I said, "Really?"

489
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:46,200
(Laughter) Discussing Sahaja Yogis is never
discussion on Sahaja Yoga.

490
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,990
If you are discussing people you are not discussing
Sahaja Yoga.

491
00:47:51,990 --> 00:48:00,160
Discussing Sahaja Yoga has nothing to do with
human beings or with Realized souls.

492
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:08,849
Thank God, you don't discuss Me, because I
must be making lots of mistakes.

493
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:15,410
In relation to your culture, in relation to
your styles, in relation to the human style.

494
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:18,820
For example, you have to say, "Thank you"
ten times.

495
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,580
I might be saying it only three times or four
times.

496
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,310
Or you have to say, "Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry."

497
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:30,410
On the telephone even now, I never say sorry,
I say, "I beg your pardon?"

498
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,700
But you see, people will say, "Sorry, sorry,
sorry."

499
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:39,370
I start thinking, "Am I in the wrong or they
are in the wrong?"

500
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:40,370
(Laughter)

501
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:54,180
So when we start discussing others, what we
really do is to confront or to face someone

502
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,240
with your own limitations.

503
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:04,440
And we start thinking, "He should have done
like this, he should have ..." What about

504
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,440
you?

505
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:14,160
So best is, you discuss yourself with yourself
and you discuss Sahaja Yoga with others.

506
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,280
This is the best way to get rid of one of
the greatest enemies of collectivity, is gossip.

507
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:26,510
Is a human nature, you know, I think, to gossip.

508
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:36,910
Another horrible thing we have, which Buddha
has tried to control, is a very subtle type

509
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:39,279
of aggressiveness.

510
00:49:39,279 --> 00:49:44,510
That one of the games I play is of making
somebody a leader.

511
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:46,270
It's a game, please remember.

512
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:49,400
Even if I tell you, "I'm Mahamaya", you forget
it.

513
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,160
Even if I tell you, "I'm playing a game",
still you forget it.

514
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,640
You become so seriously leaders, you see.

515
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,500
It's nothing to feel that you are leaders,
there's nothing like leaders, there's nothing

516
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,950
like that in Sahaja Yoga.

517
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:06,230
But then I praise some.

518
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:12,310
Now I had a mind to praise people today for
yesterday's program.

519
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:17,970
The way it was arranged, the way it was done
beautifully, so many people came, is remarkable.

520
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:22,600
But then I was thinking, "Should I say or
not?"

521
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:31,280
(Laughter) If I say, next time, God knows
what I will see.

522
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:39,400
(Laughter) So encouraging like this, will
it help or not?

523
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,370
So I've been still discreet about it.

524
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:48,849
Of course, I must say, yesterday's program
was very remarkable and we must really give

525
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:58,130
a hand to Dave and to the leader, our Karan.

526
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,060
(Applause)

527
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:19,180
Despite all stupid opposition and nonsense,
they have shown how they have brought in so

528
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:26,350
many people to Sahaja Yoga and how with complete
concentration they have been able to establish

529
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:32,619
so many in Sahaja Yoga.

530
00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:41,100
So it is for you to learn from it, that despite
all problems and anything, without feeling

531
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:50,940
bad about it, just see that you move like
a big elephant towards giving Realization

532
00:51:50,940 --> 00:52:01,640
to others, creating more Sahaja Yogis and
more Sahaja Yogis in America.

533
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:08,869
Those who had this aim in life that we have
to give Realization to people, we have to

534
00:52:08,869 --> 00:52:19,380
achieve establishment of Sahaja Yoga, they
never will have any problems of any kind.

535
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:26,740
So never bring down yourself to the level
where you think that, "See, the food was not

536
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:33,170
good, that was not good, this one was not
good, this fellow was torturing, that fellow

537
00:52:32,969 --> 00:52:34,799
was doing this."

538
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Nothing.

539
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,670
This is not going to help you, help anyone.

540
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:43,160
Not going to give you any marks, as they say.

541
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:48,680
After all if you have to enter into the Kingdom
of God, one has to know that you have to have

542
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,690
certain marks.

543
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:56,280
Otherwise God will say, "You failed", (Laughter)
and you'll be surprised why the entrance is

544
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,560
not allowed.

545
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:03,900
You are thinking you are so intelligent, so
great, you see, how much gossip you have created,

546
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:08,820
how much problems you have created, how many
leaders you have pulled down, how much you

547
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,310
have befooled Mother and all that.

548
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:15,510
(Laughter) And there suddenly you find, "I've
failed.

549
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:18,930
(Laughter) What has happened?"

550
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:22,320
So don't deceive your Self.

551
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,530
Self is the Spirit.

552
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,410
Don't deceive your Self.

553
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:34,430
If you deceive yourself, ultimately you will
be deceived and despite the fact you have

554
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:40,369
been Sahaja Yogis, you have been to My Puja,
you have been here and you have been certified

555
00:53:40,168 --> 00:53:44,579
as Sahaja Yogis, there's light on your head,
still they will say, "Take another life,

556
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,040
and then come back.

557
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:55,380
Take another as, you see, failed, you have
to go through one year more.

558
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,180
Try another one."

559
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,180
(Laughter)

560
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:04,320
So the easiest way to be a good Sahaja Yogi,
not to deceive your Self.

561
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,000
Watch yourself!

562
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,710
Where is this mind going?

563
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:11,710
What am I thinking?

564
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,480
What is my mind working now?

565
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:21,710
Can I, this man is coming, can I give him
Realization?

566
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:23,273
Should I start talking to him about Sahaja Yoga?

567
00:54:23,474 --> 00:54:26,380
Sitting in the train, you watch a person.

568
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:29,770
"Ah, this is all right!

569
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:32,480
Let's manage this fellow."

570
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:39,859
All the time you have to catch human beings
like fishes are caught.

571
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:44,760
I've taught you how to do it.

572
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,170
To go on catching them, one by one, and create
a greater collectivity.

573
00:54:49,170 --> 00:55:02,740
If your attention is on that, then I will
say, "You have acted like Buddha", because

574
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:06,130
Buddha just did that.

575
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:12,130
From everywhere He collected people, told
them to follow a path of detachment and He

576
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:17,780
asked them to wear clothes and things which
are for detachment.

577
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:23,510
And He asked that you should detach yourself
from your families, everything.

578
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:30,870
This, all this, He did for one thing, that
they should be prepared for today's life.

579
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:37,430
That they've done all these things, but we
don't want you to wear orange dresses, we

580
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:45,860
don't want you to do all these wrong things,
which are not needed today.

581
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:51,380
They were all right in those days, but today
they are wrong because they are not needed.

582
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:57,800
When it is not needed, why should you carry
on your head?

583
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,960
Like the other day, I saw somebody carrying
a big boat on his head.

584
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,650
I said, "What are you doing?"

585
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:05,140
He said, "I'm carrying the boat."

586
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:06,140
"For what?

587
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,700
Why are you carrying the boat?"

588
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:14,800
Said, "You see, I know there is no need to
carry the boat here because there is no sea,

589
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,320
no water, nothing, but I'm just carrying."

590
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:24,190
(Laughter) "But why are you carrying this
load upon your head?"

591
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:30,650
"Ah, because I'm carrying, you know."

592
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:31,730
(Laughter)

593
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,810
That is how we are.

594
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:37,849
We are carrying on with things which are not
needed.

595
00:56:37,849 --> 00:56:42,790
Like, "Mother, now I've been doing Hatha Yoga,
should I do some Hatha Yoga?"

596
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:46,460
"But why do you want to do it?

597
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,420
There is no need for you."

598
00:56:48,219 --> 00:56:53,559
"No, no, Mother, but I've been doing it."

599
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,260
(Laughter) "So do it now, what to do?"

600
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:03,820
It's as stupid as this carrying a boat on
your head, that whatever is not needed unnecessarily

601
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,260
wasting your time.

602
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:14,150
"I'm used to this, Mother, I used to do this,
so I must do it."

603
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:18,070
Everything is made very easy for you in Sahaja
Yoga.

604
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,070
Very simple.

605
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:24,780
You don't have to starve, you don't have to
fast, you don't have to become vegetarians,

606
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:30,359
you don't have to go and sit in the sun or
meditate on Himalayas.

607
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:32,160
Nothing of the kind.

608
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,190
Comfortably you can sit down wherever you
like and you can meditate.

609
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:40,930
Everything made easy.

610
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:48,150
And once you've found out your Spirit, you
can enjoy everything that's beautiful.

611
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:53,900
Now on the whole, maybe for some people this
is really too much.

612
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:59,150
In a Sahara Desert you are sitting, everything
blowing on your head.

613
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,150
"What is this?

614
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,220
How can we live here?

615
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,660
Such a rough life!"

616
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:09,530
But you don't feel that way, because you have
the comfort of the Spirit within you.

617
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:12,930
It's the comfort of the Spirit.

618
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:19,320
And for the comfort of Spirit you don't need
anything, that's what you have.

619
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:24,050
So do not carry on with nonsensical things.

620
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:26,000
Because Buddha went round and round.

621
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,990
As we came today to this program, I was just
thinking like Buddha.

622
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:35,310
Going from this end, again coming from this
end, then I couldn't find it, then that end,

623
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:36,310
then coming this way.

624
00:58:36,109 --> 00:58:38,089
Ultimately we reached here, they said it's blocked!

625
00:58:38,089 --> 00:58:43,429
I said, "Give him a bandhan."

626
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:45,410
Finished, open!

627
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:48,500
So this was blocked, that was blocked, go
this way, that way.

628
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,740
All right, it was blocked for Him.

629
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,440
So He went round and round.

630
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,080
But it's not blocked for you.

631
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,180
Why do you want to go round and round again?

632
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,280
But that is what today everybody wants to
do the same way.

633
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,790
"We must sacrifice, we must give up this,
we must do that."

634
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,260
What are you going to sacrifice?

635
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:08,320
What is there to sacrifice?

636
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:18,410
I would like to know in Sahaja Yoga.

637
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:26,960
Of course, mostly people sacrifice their brains,
I think.

638
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:34,960
(Laughter) When nothing is to be sacrificed,
why do you want to become a goat of sacrifice?

639
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:44,089
So from Buddha's life, you don't have to learn
that He went in the jungles and He went, He

640
00:59:44,089 --> 00:59:47,910
did this and He did also renunciation.

641
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:50,660
He gave up his wife.

642
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:51,660
No!

643
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:59,290
That's not needed now, that's over.

644
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:06,619
This is where we fail and we cannot explain
to people that those who say, "But we must

645
01:00:06,619 --> 01:00:07,750
have renunciation."

646
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:13,590
Renunciation we have from within, like the
sand, as I told you.

647
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:16,780
Detachment we have from within.

648
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:25,390
But this is compassion, pure compassion is
the most detached thing.

649
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:36,660
Is the most detached thing is the pure compassion,
or anything pure is pure because it is detached.

650
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:40,470
It's a proper mathematics.

651
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,910
Anything that is pure has to be detached.

652
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:47,900
If it is attached it is contaminated.

653
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,080
See the logic.

654
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:53,349
Absolute mathematics is there.

655
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:56,810
If you have pure love then you are detached.

656
01:00:56,810 --> 01:01:01,300
Now supposing you love Mother - all right,
take that.

657
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:09,520
Now you have say, pure love for Me, then you
won't get angry if I don't come to your house.

658
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:14,010
You won't feel disappointed if I can't sit
in your car.

659
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:18,790
You won't feel unhappy because I could not
touch your sari.

660
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:21,240
Because, "I just love Mother, finished."

661
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,880
It ends up there.

662
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,520
Just pure love.

663
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:31,490
Of course, I know these weaknesses, so I try
to please you, all right, all right.

664
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:38,970
But actually, if you really love Me, "It's
all right, I love Her, and She loves me, finished.

665
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:45,150
Whether She comes to my house or not, whether
She gives me a present or not, whether She

666
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:51,230
pats me or not, whether I can see Her or not,
whether I can meet Her or not.

667
01:01:51,029 --> 01:01:53,119
Makes no difference, I love Her."

668
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,060
That's the purity of love.

669
01:01:55,060 --> 01:02:01,670
Where there's no expectation of any kind,
except that I love and that love is the ocean

670
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:08,420
of enjoyment and the ocean of bliss, finished.

671
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:15,010
Is the easiest thing to do, is to love.

672
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:19,620
Just love.

673
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:27,660
How your heart increases like an ocean - I
just love.

674
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:31,130
The sea is not attached to any shore.

675
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:36,590
When it has to come, it comes out, when it
has to go back, it goes back.

676
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:39,980
When it has to give water for the rain, it
gives.

677
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:46,130
The water goes as the clouds are formed, then
the water falls as rain, again it comes back

678
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,470
to the sea.

679
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:51,770
It doesn't stop anywhere.

680
01:02:51,770 --> 01:03:00,490
In the same way, if we just think, "Is the feeling
I have that I love Mother.

681
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:01,720
What a feeling it is."

682
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:10,770
That should be the end of everything, absolutely.

683
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:17,520
I feel the same way; otherwise I would be
feeling every day guilty, "Oh, I didn't smile

684
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,770
at that, I didn't give a present to this one.

685
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:24,490
I should have brought something special for
that person.

686
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:26,490
I was late for the program."

687
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:37,750
(Laughter) But I
don't feel guilty because it's all managed.

688
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:43,450
If I had come earlier, all these hecklers
would have been there to trouble us.

689
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:46,510
So all the horrible people disappeared and
we had the right people.

690
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:49,660
Then I set down through.

691
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,490
I didn't say, "I'm going back."

692
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:53,530
There is no need to be nervous.

693
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:58,420
If Mother is late, there must be some plan.

694
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:01,540
If She is early, there must be some plan.

695
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:07,290
If She's going by this plane and not by the
other, there must be some plan.

696
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:09,339
Not to doubt it.

697
01:04:09,339 --> 01:04:11,960
If She's doing something, must be some plan.

698
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:15,030
You know, Mother has Her own plans.

699
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:18,250
Is a nice idea to think like that.

700
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:22,800
"She has Her own plans, you know."

701
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:30,990
Once you start feeling that way, such security
and such beautiful peace will spread in your

702
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:31,990
being.

703
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:34,359
And you will be quite satisfied.

704
01:04:34,359 --> 01:04:38,480
Now, everybody brings food for Me, look at
that.

705
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:44,750
I mean, when I see that I get a fright, baba.

706
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:49,980
(Laughter) I mean, look at that!

707
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:57,590
I'm supposed to taste it, but even tasting
will be so much.

708
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:06,230
(Laughter) But I've to eat, you know, because
if I don't touch one of them, then they will

709
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:07,710
think, "Why didn't Mother touch?

710
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:08,710
Must be something wrong."

711
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:21,030
(Laughter) This is a very big problem for
Me, to keep you happy and to assure you.

712
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:24,970
But I assure you that I love you all very
much!!

713
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:30,119
Whether you bring food for Me, or flowers
for Me or anything.

714
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:32,160
Does not matter.

715
01:05:31,959 --> 01:05:39,388
When I'm leaving Bogota, My heart is wrenching
out, I've seen the wrench of My heart, I've

716
01:05:39,589 --> 01:05:40,589
seen.

717
01:05:40,589 --> 01:05:44,510
Because I'm leaving all the new babes there,
that's all.

718
01:05:44,309 --> 01:05:51,279
Then I just don't want to face, I mean, the
thing, I feel, "Oh God, just see I'm leaving

719
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,480
them."

720
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,510
But, because I love them.

721
01:05:56,309 --> 01:06:04,599
So I see, because I love them I feel it, so
it's all right, even this pain is all right, because

722
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,550
I love them.

723
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:11,200
I enjoy that pain because I love them.

724
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,970
And then I come here and see all of you standing
at the airport.

725
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:17,720
Whole thing is fulfilled again.

726
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:26,520
Just not because you have come - because I
have come to love you.

727
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:32,440
All this is such a beautiful rapport and such
a beautiful feeling.

728
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:39,240
I want you all to enjoy this and not petty
things and small things which spoil your joy.

729
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:46,020
These are all joy killers and that's why the
greatest joy killer is the ego nonsensical,

730
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:50,839
which tells you, "Oh, why didn't Mother do
this or do that?"

731
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:53,000
It's the ego part of it.

732
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,380
That's why we have to think of Buddha and
celebrate his Jayanti within ourselves to

733
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:07,870
establish Him to say that, "This ego cannot
take away our joy."

734
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:13,580
Anywhere such idea just comes into your head
tell them, "Now Mister ego, I know you very

735
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:14,580
well!"

736
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:20,720
(Laughter) In the light of Buddha you can
see your ego very clearly.

737
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:24,619
And He's the killer of your ego, He's the
one who finishes off your ego.

738
01:07:24,619 --> 01:07:33,480
So today we have to pray for the whole of
America which is really suffering from this

739
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:38,050
nonsensical, mythical ego, which is being
exploited by everyone.

740
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:43,329
People are befooling them, the media is befooling,
all the doctors are befooling, all the psychologists

741
01:07:43,329 --> 01:07:47,470
are befooling, all the governments are befooling.

742
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:51,630
I mean, I don't know, everybody is befooled,
because they've got ego.

743
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:54,220
If they had no ego, they could not have been
befooled.

744
01:07:54,220 --> 01:08:02,450
All these advertisements and all this hocus-pocus
that's going on, is because human beings have

745
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:06,609
ego and they can't see it.

746
01:08:06,609 --> 01:08:14,910
So we have to say, "Mother, please take away
this curse of ego from Americans and America."

747
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:20,230
That's why it is nice today we have this Buddha
Puja.

748
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,279
May God bless you!
