[Music]

2
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:29,300
collectivity doesn't mean that we all

3
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:32,589
should be stuck together with some glue

4
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:39,500
or something or we all become like

5
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:44,539
Gibraltar no it doesn't mean it means

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:47,660
wherever you are you are connected that

7
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:49,190
is collected but if you are not

8
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,379
connected and you are just glued

9
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:57,710
together it's very inconvenient to live

10
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:59,359
under such circumstances I think people

11
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:04,489
don't even understand the meaning of

12
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:09,950
collectivity where there's not the other

13
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:17,020
anon now there's not the other there's

14
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:20,810
no other personality these personalities

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:26,560
are separated from you because of left

16
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,560
and right or could be both

17
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:38,110
but you are yourself fully when you are

18
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:43,350
absolutely detached and your Kundalini

19
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:43,350
is dancing you are alone and never alone

20
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:59,700
this oneness with the whole gives you

21
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:06,420
all the security that you want all the

22
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:10,789
joy you want and that's why Kundalini

23
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,789
awakening means collectivity

24
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:19,190
unless and until you want pure

25
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,790
collectivity in your being

26
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:30,230
Kundalini won't rise

27
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:39,240
[Music]

28
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:44,850
so now let us see how do we miss out on

29
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:50,850
collecting it's a very practical

30
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:53,070
down-to-earth understanding first we

31
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:58,530
must know without collectivity we cannot

32
00:02:53,070 --> 00:03:03,090
exist as the body has to be in

33
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:05,700
connection with a brain in the same way

34
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:13,350
without collectivity sahaja yoga cannot

35
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:16,160
exist once you understand that then you

36
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,019
have to work it out that collectivity is

37
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:24,900
absolutely established within and

38
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:27,959
without I do not know what thing comes

39
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,620
first in the human mind about another

40
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:38,239
person but the first thing is that these

41
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:43,320
are your real relations and nobody else

42
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:48,570
are your relations these children are

43
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:50,489
your children and these men are your

44
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,760
brothers and these ladies are your

45
00:03:50,489 --> 00:04:00,570
sisters and we are one big family

46
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:06,060
together we are part and parcel of one

47
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:08,900
body as this hand cannot hit another

48
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,370
hand thank God it doesn't think

49
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,450
otherwise as human beings they might

50
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,669
start thinking against another hand but

51
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:21,269
they don't because they are connected to

52
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:28,740
one brain activity

53
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:33,580
[Music]

54
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:38,020
so you can see that when we ascend in

55
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:44,380
the collective consciousness and we have

56
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:46,419
collective living collective meeting at

57
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:52,870
the wish of the chakra Shri Krishna

58
00:04:46,419 --> 00:05:02,200
established this all he manifested this

59
00:04:52,870 --> 00:05:09,250
pure relationship of a sister in a

60
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:12,430
collective life that we have in the

61
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:16,450
ashram where we live where we move about

62
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:22,630
at sahaja Yogi's if we do not have this

63
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:25,740
basic principle within us there will be

64
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:30,130
a can of chaos complete loss

65
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:34,300
once this purity of relationship is

66
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:38,669
established that apart from my wife all

67
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,669
the rest are my sisters or mothers

68
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,580
it cannot be

69
00:05:50,969 --> 00:06:04,139
a proper society and the chaos of the

70
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:10,949
social system of America is because they

71
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:12,659
have no sense of pure relationships once

72
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:16,469
you call somebody a sister she's a

73
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:21,659
sister and once you call somebody a

74
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:23,189
brother she's a brother it's not only

75
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:27,029
that you should be born of the same

76
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:32,099
parents it's not necessary but this is a

77
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:36,029
very important principle to have a very

78
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:38,299
pure society where every caddy can live

79
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,299
peacefully

80
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:51,329
[Music]

81
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:54,779
think of the tree which is say in a

82
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:59,149
turmoil or during earthquake it won't

83
00:06:54,779 --> 00:07:02,939
grow when the earthquake stops

84
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:06,059
everything becomes quiet everything is

85
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:08,249
peaceful then only the tree can grow in

86
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:10,769
the same way our growth can only take

87
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:16,409
place if we are peaceful within

88
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:19,649
ourselves so for a Kundalini growing

89
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:20,249
wider and wider and rising higher and

90
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:23,009
higher

91
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:27,869
first thing is we must have peace within

92
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:31,679
ourselves but this peace is possible if

93
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:34,199
you can make ready peace with others if

94
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:37,559
you cannot make peace with others who

95
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:40,709
are in sahaja yoga who are in the

96
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:44,159
collective if you are in a turmoil this

97
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:47,149
Kundalini can never rise that is why

98
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:50,069
collectivity is so important

99
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:54,479
without collectivity usually cannot

100
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:57,389
offer and without connectivity you

101
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:01,739
cannot have the growth of your

102
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:04,319
spirituality if the growth of the

103
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:08,399
spirituality as they say the Tree of

104
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:11,879
Life is upside down and the roots are in

105
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:17,969
the brain and this Kundalini has to go

106
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:20,909
and water that brain as we bottle the

107
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:25,549
roots then it starts flowing downward

108
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:25,549
and that's how we start expanding

109
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:34,930
[Music]

110
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,089
now mother has said we have to have

111
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,130
compassion when away do you have our

112
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:42,159
compassion on the walls where do we use

113
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:45,670
our compassion where do we use our

114
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,410
compassion so Sergio guys to be

115
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,770
practiced doesn't mean that you sit down

116
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:53,279
with my photograph all the time doesn't

117
00:08:50,770 --> 00:09:01,540
mean that it means you practice

118
00:08:53,279 --> 00:09:03,760
compassion you practice that then you

119
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,850
have to practice love now how do you

120
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,880
practice love with others if you love

121
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:15,880
someone what do you do you try to please

122
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:18,279
that was small things can make people

123
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,650
very happy I know you all try to please

124
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,420

125
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:25,089

127
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:31,930

00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:36,250
me I am over priest I am sorry but I am

129
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:38,709
more pleased much more pleased if you

130
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:41,950
understand collectivity and try to

131
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:45,459
please each other so now the practice

132
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:50,320
love where you practice I ask you a

133
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:55,089
question where do I practice love what

134
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:57,790
do I love believe love our house we love

135
00:09:55,089 --> 00:10:01,270
our photographs of decorations

136
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:07,390
everything but do I practice this love

137
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:10,020
on my wife or my husband or another

138
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,020
sahaja Yogi's

139

[Music]

140
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:28,680
in our search culture we have to

141
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:33,450
practice compassion and love and thirdly

142
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:35,940
we have to practice patience I know some

143
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,510
children are maybe little more

144
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:41,490
mischievous some are less mischievous

145
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,410
maybe some people are very talkative

146
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,510
sometimes really they gave me also a

147
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,590
headache

148
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:50,550
they go on talking talking talking

149
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:54,530
talking so much sometimes I think it's

150
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,530
good because it's a rest for my mouth

151
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,880
one way of looking at it another way of

152
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,590
looking of it is just switch off your

153
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,150
mind let him talk take it out whatever

154
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:10,910
you want once he is finished with it in

155
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:13,500
fact out then he won't bother you much

156
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:17,160
and also it feels satisfied that

157
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,620
somebody has listened to his practice so

158
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:24,570
patience is needed and patience is

159
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:27,720
needed in such a way that others should

160
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,610
see your patience yesterday for example

161
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,680
I was sitting for about I think three

162
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:37,650
hours shaking hands with all sorts of

163
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:40,860
people and all types of problems and the

164
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:45,290
person who came last he said looking at

165
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,290
your patience I develop my own patience

166
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:56,760
and love gives you patience this love

167
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:01,020
nourishes you I am Telling You it

168
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,880
substituted down-to-earth method here I

169
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:06,140
have not mentioned that you trust God

170
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,370
I'm just saying trust yourself

171
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,540
absolutely down to earth because we are

172
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,540
talking about your brain

173
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:23,749
[Music]

174
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:27,589
so today's understanding should be that

175
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:29,079
we all should become collective from

176
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:33,670
itself

177
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:38,689
we should not grudge or grumble about

178
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:42,079
and enjoy the collectivity but the

179
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:45,230
second sight of collectivity is this

180
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,360
that do not try to exploit the

181
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,209
collectivity otherwise we'll be in

182
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,449
trouble like I've seen some people don't

183
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:58,579
know how to use their bathrooms when you

184
00:12:53,449 --> 00:13:04,429
are collective you have to be respecting

185
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:07,189
the collectivity of others by your

186
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:12,619
presence another person should not by

187
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:21,110
any chance suffer or should not feel in

188
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:26,209
any way insulted or inconvenient

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:27,970
inconvenienced so when you are in the

190
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:31,749
collective it should be such that

191
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:38,179
another person should enjoy your company

192
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:47,629
enjoy your being there that's something

193
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:49,790
where there is no problem but if you are

194
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:52,370
demanding and if you are asking for

195
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:55,429
things and you think no end of yourself

196
00:13:52,370 --> 00:14:01,399
you cannot collect you by any chance but

197
00:13:55,429 --> 00:14:06,769
you will suffer for them automatically

00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:12,999
you'll suffer if this is realized and

angry with you boast but just make that

203
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:44,619
anger into forgiveness and you see the

00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:55,029
will upset you

it's the biggest weapon you have God is

210
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:10,730
to forgive and this is shown in buddha's

211
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:13,299
character throughout now we have been

212
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:18,499
saying that we have to forgive everyone

213
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:21,829
but we don't practice that small small

214
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:23,720
things like mad people we remember only

this capacity to remember if somebody

217
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:31,119
has hurt him but here I find human

218
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:34,100
beings have no less combatants

219
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:35,869

everything whatever has hurt them but

how they have hurt others they don't

others they are no no because this is a

in the habit of criticism better

criticize yourself is better because

242
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:53,019
these are habits also people especially

243
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:55,660
I have seen people in the West they

244
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:58,389
react to everything if they see this

245
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,249

247
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:04,740
you got to do with it now I don't like

00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:07,089
it it's not yours

249
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,419
what's the question it's lying here and

250
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:14,730
why should you be so upset what I don't

00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:24,519
like that person I don't like that dress

252

00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:32,950
allowed inside

254
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:35,769
I don't like there is the way of saying

255
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:39,029
things but there is no need to say

256
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:39,029
anything whatsoever

257
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:52,150

face is very funny when they draw not

the children even grown-ups

265
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:20,690
then what I appreciate is very good

266
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:24,950
wonderful very nice to encourage that

267
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:26,809
person so criticism should go out of our

268
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:31,549
mind but appreciation should be

269
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:36,380
practiced appreciation of others

270
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:38,780
children appreciation of other people is

271
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:42,250
very important but that doesn't mean

272
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:44,419
that you appreciate all others and

273
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,289
torture your wife or tortured your

274
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:51,140
husband that also is an environment

275
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:54,830
first responsibility is your family but

276
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:57,260
you should appreciate others and this

277
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,559
comes when you have no jealousies about

278
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,280
anyone this jealousy I don't know from

279
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,830
where it comes

280
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:08,419
I don't know this quality of jealousy

281
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:10,640
why there is jealousy so also if you

282
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:13,640
have jealousy you have to use it for the

283
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,919
right purpose and what is the right

284
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,140
purpose is that you should be jealous of

285
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,260
a person who is spiritually higher than

286
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:24,409
you and you practice it that you become

287
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:27,200
better if jealousy is for competition

288
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:32,020
then you compete with a person who is

289
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:38,630
more compassionate more loving more

290
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:40,760
sacrificing more patient so this

291
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:43,820
competition becomes a very healthy

292
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:46,570
competition and the collectivity becomes

293
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,570
very nourished

addressing their style of talking is

extremely aggressive the way they say

300

to be curved so what you have to

311
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:58,679
practice here is humility try to be able

312
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:06,519
humility is that in no way you try to

313
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:09,970
address others and if others are

314
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:12,669
aggressive you accept it as a childish

315
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:16,720
thing as a stupid thing as a foolish

316
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:20,799

humility which you have to practice and

319
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:33,340
all these qualities if you have you will

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:17,440
strengthens others and the strength of

376
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:20,390
the whole collectivity improves so much

377
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,080
we are meditating together is a very big

378
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:26,660
thing everyone has to understand that

379
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,640
whenever you get time you find out in

380
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,580
the morning times for example we'll go

381
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,740
to the ashram and meditate say Sunday

382
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,960
morning will just want me to take in the

383
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,870
ashram just for meditation you have to

384
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,860
come meditate and go away because I

385
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:45,610
reside in this ashram I'm here so leave

386
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:48,770
your homes come here and meditate

387
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:52,460
meditation will help you a lot wherever

388
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:54,920
you are together and with it but when

389
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:59,510
you are away from each other I am NOT

390
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:01,760
with you only in difficulties when you

391
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:04,760
are pushed into some places where I am

392
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:09,110
not that where you think I'm not there I

393
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:11,900
am there but if you deliberately are

394
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:14,150
keeping out of collectivity and not with

395
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:17,150
you so try to grow your collectivity

396
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:21,110
otherwise you cannot go deep into your

397
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:24,830
own depths you cannot become a great

398
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:27,770
sahaja yogi you cannot really be called

399
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:32,110
as such those who have a sense of

400
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:32,110
collectivity can only become that

00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:43,920
[Music]

402
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:50,179
sangham sharanam gachami Sangha means

403
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:54,780
collectivity I surrender myself to the

404
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:57,120
collected so here in complete awareness

405
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,590
I mean you cannot be mesmerized

406
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,460
if you are mesmerized then you can do

407
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:05,850
whatever way you like but in complete

408
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:12,950
awareness and full understanding we have

409
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:15,570
to become collective but once you are

410
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:20,250
without ego means you have surrendered

411
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:22,730
yourself no one can cheat you can you

412
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,730
understand that

413
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:34,850
no one can cheat you because there is

414
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:38,580
some higher force which is looking after

415
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:43,590
this is the way we should understand

416
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:47,760
Buddha this is we should know our Buddha

417
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:50,610
qualities this is how our ego can be

418
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:54,630
dissolved when you say mother is

419
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:59,630
surrender to you that just means that

420
00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:06,480
you give this horrible ego a complete

421
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:15,260
holiday it means that that is how this

422
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:18,350
ego disappears I think all your just now

423
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:22,830
raga eyes are open out most of you

424
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:28,650
somehow and then you would laugh at

425
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:31,820
everything you make fun of yourself just

426
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,820
enjoy everything

427
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:42,710
[Music]

428
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:46,609
last but not the least one must

429
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:49,580
understand that as all the seven chakras

430
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:55,099
I am working on are in a collective way

431
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:58,219
held by me my Murata the quality of

432
00:28:55,099 --> 00:29:02,960
Virata gana is that that she creates

433
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:10,369
this universal awareness within us the

434
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:13,700
collectivity and if you do not realize

435
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:19,450
that in modern times we are in a

436
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,450
spiritual part in a collective way only

437
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:30,159
this is what it is because we have

438
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:35,210
reached to the state of Salaam and here

439
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:40,219
we have to have a collective working

440
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:43,009
only there's no other way out this is

441
00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:48,169
the most important point we must know if

442
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:50,659
he cannot be collective because of

443
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:52,849
anything jealousy maybe inferiority

444
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:55,159
complex maybe any anything which is

445
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:58,789
coming from behind like a worm crawling

446
00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:00,320
up then know that something wrong with

447
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:05,719
you nothing wrong with the collectivity

448
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:10,159
I hope you can understand my vision and

449
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:14,299

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,950

452
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:22,940
