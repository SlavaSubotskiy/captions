1
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:28,585
I've had a very hectic, strenuous

2
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:31,825
journey through America

3
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:33,805
and

4
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:38,095
it was much beyond my expectation,

5
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:39,265
it worked out very well

6
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:41,545
and I'm very happy about it.

7
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:44,765
All the Americans are very thankful

8
00:00:45,115 --> 00:00:46,705
to the Sahaja Yogis of

9
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:48,965
England

10
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:51,905
and other countries who have

11
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:54,645
contributed to this tour

12
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:58,365
and specially to people who travelled across

13
00:00:58,365 --> 00:00:59,555
and went around

14
00:00:59,865 --> 00:01:01,675
and helped them to organize.

15
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:05,985
So

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,120
they have been extremely grateful I tell you,

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,160
but for you people it would not have been possible.

18
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:16,415
It was a very

19
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:19,975
strenuous journey, no doubt, and strenuous

20
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:22,425
tour and everything was a bit too much

21
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:25,395
after the tour of

22
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:26,765
Europe.

23
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:31,235
But the way people went from here and you helped them,

24
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,185
and you sent money.

25
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:38,575
There was much less strain on them and they could manage it very well

26
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:40,875
and as you know that we have done very well

27
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,115
as far as

28
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:45,185
our

29
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,985
sowing the seed of Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

30
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:54,335
So the seed of Sahaja Yoga is now sown

31
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,145
and it may take a big flight,

32
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:02,835
I am sure because Americans have I know

33
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:03,835
they are very,

34
00:02:03,985 --> 00:02:06,965
people who are uprooted type and

35
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:08,645
quite shallow people,

36
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:12,265
and one can say that also

37
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,055
that they go on

38
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:17,585
changing their gurus every third day and

39
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:19,785
their cars every fourth day and their wives fifth day.

40
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:26,915
But they have changed so many of them that

41
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:28,325
it is easier to bring them round

42
00:02:29,255 --> 00:02:32,685
and talk to them about reality.

43
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:35,905
That the greatest part of it

44
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:37,545
and the

45
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:41,295
most of them have been to some guru or someone

46
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:43,755
I think better give

47
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,625
and

48
00:02:46,975 --> 00:02:50,045
the result of all that is that they have reached

49
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,045
conclusions

50
00:02:52,575 --> 00:02:54,985
that if reality

51
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,105
has to come it should come

52
00:02:58,305 --> 00:03:01,125
in the way Sahaja Yoga is.

53
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,560
So it's not such a difficult thing  to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

54
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,780
But the best part of it, they have been to all gurus

55
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,480
who have given them a good licking, real good licking

56
00:03:11,335 --> 00:03:14,375
They have lost all their money, they have been trained so much,

57
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,345
they had to do all kinds of things

58
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:20,575
they had to starve themselves and no food

59
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:21,785
and

60
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:24,745
sometimes they had to

61
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:28,995
run for miles together, do all kinds of acrobatics and

62
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:30,435
all kinds of things they have done

63
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,435
As a result

64
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:36,615
to them Sahaja Yoga is very precious.

65
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:37,755
This is a difference I think

66
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:41,025
with others and Americans is, because

67
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:44,815
you have not known those severe type of gurus that they have had

68
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:47,955
who just torture their lives all the time saying that,

69
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:50,885
" you have to do these things

70
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:54,815
just to get rid of your sins and this has to be done, because of your sins, you are like this"

71
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,320
And the main thing was, I discovered there

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
that the

73
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,575
philosophers or the writers who wrote about

74
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:07,015
the unconscious have also made a very big mistake

75
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:10,825
and they said that if you have to go to the unconscious

76
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:12,865
you have to pass through subconscious.

77
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:16,595
And when I saw this diagram I was surprised.

78
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,775
Jung had done the diagram with the unconscious

79
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:23,325
and the unconscious becoming conscious

80
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:26,915
and on top of that, was the

81
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:30,005
subconscious and then the conscious mind

82
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:34,035
and then the ego. So it was such a mixed bag.

83
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:37,505
So I told them that god is the greatest planner

84
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:40,875
and He has kept the central path for you

85
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,185
absolutely open

86
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:48,195
which is Sushumna path and the subconscious is on left and the supra- conscious is on the right side.

87
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,365
So you don't have to pass through all these things,

88
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:54,845
even in an airport supposing you have to pass through the luggage

89
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:58,135
to go to the aeroplane what will happen?

90
00:04:58,135 --> 00:05:01,395
And when human beings can understand that what about God?

91
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:05,575
He has to be a greater organiser, a greater

92
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:08,405
thinker than we are.

93
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:11,995
And he could not have thought of such a mixed bag for us that

94
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:14,885
when we have to ascend we have to go through our

95
00:05:14,885 --> 00:05:17,925
subconcious and then go to the unconscious.

96
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:20,845
So the whole thing is they had no picture, it was all a

97
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:23,125
mental projection

98
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:26,115
and that's  how they made all the mistakes there and

99
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:29,265
when they published these things, perhaps the gurus

100
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:32,355
who are agurus must have taken a clue

101
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:35,815
and that's how they started talking that you have to go to

102
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:36,815
unconscious.

103
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:39,965
and that's how the whole thing has been worked out

104
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:43,325
that people thought that we have to go to the

105
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:46,515
unconscious through the subconscious.

106
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:49,405
And when this happened they said that if you have

107
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:52,305
to go to the subconscious we must bear up everything,

108
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:55,265
we must get possessed, we must get bhootish,

109
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:56,605
we must take drugs,

110
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:00,655
we must do all those things that the mad people are doing.

111
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:04,305
In addition to that they used Bible for that purpose,

112
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:08,765
because in the Bible it is said that when the Holy Ghost came they all started behaving like mad people.

113
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:10,765
This was Mr Paul's mischief

114
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:14,975
and that's how they justified it

115
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,535
that we all have to get mad to become spiritual.

116
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:21,525
So this kind of a stupid idea

117
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:24,635
was taken over and was exploited

118
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,635
by the

119
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,560
real thugs of India. Then it is now taken over

120
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,260
by the thugs of Amercians also. So the

121
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:35,685
Americans are also

122
00:06:36,225 --> 00:06:39,195
forming some groups there, they have also become

123
00:06:39,195 --> 00:06:42,265
gurus and they are also teaching people

124
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:43,955
that you have to become

125
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:48,135
mad before becoming realized soul.

126
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:51,955
It's such a thing that they never understood that

127
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:54,905
there has to be some sort of a way

128
00:06:54,905 --> 00:07:01,025
made by God Himself for our ascent. Why will He make it so difficult. He has never made even a

129
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:03,745
sprouting of the seed difficult,

130
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:05,395
why will He make our evolution so difficult?

131
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:08,615
And that's why these poor things you see,

132
00:07:08,615 --> 00:07:11,085
half of them are mad. Really mad people,

133
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:14,145
when they came to Sahaja Yoga, they had blisters all over their hands.

134
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:17,425
All blisters on the left hand side, you could see all their hands were burning.

135
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:20,515
Shaking all the time before Me, it was terrible I mean,

136
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,200
I had to

137
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:29,500
go on combating their bhoots and I really go tired with it, absolutely tired, every place I went there were

138
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,100
people who had lots of these possessions in them.

139
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:36,305
But the beauty about them which one should learn from them

140
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:39,315
is that once they realized that this is the way

141
00:07:39,315 --> 00:07:41,825
it is the truth, they are working very hard,

142
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:43,285
extremely hard

143
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:46,265
and they are very disciplined people,

144
00:07:46,455 --> 00:07:48,995
they get up in the morning, have their baths,

145
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:51,665
sit down for meditation, they work it out. They are not like us,

146
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:52,755
you see

147
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:56,405
we are very happy, you see, floating in the air,

148
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:59,385
"Mother is looking after us, it's all right,

149
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,145
we can get up at nine o'clock and then

150
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:05,345
it's alright, we say namaskar to Mother, write a nice

151
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:06,885
poetry about her", finished

152
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:09,605
They are not like that;

153
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:12,915
they are working it out because what they said was very

154
00:08:12,915 --> 00:08:15,645
remarkable thing, what they said that,

155
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:17,315
"Mother, we have gone to hell actually.

156
00:08:17,825 --> 00:08:19,815
And we have to really jet out,

157
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,705
very fast, if you have to get out of it otherwise we will never be there",

158
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:25,155
which is a fact.

159
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,805
And this is what one has to understand that

160
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:29,935
if you have to have

161
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:32,115
any

162
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:35,205
rapport

163
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:37,105
with your spirit

164
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:40,725
you have to really work very hard. Now our,

165
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:44,335
so far our Sahaja Yoga in the west, so far, I would say,

166
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:47,305
not further because today is new year's day we have to take

167
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:49,425
certain vows on a new year's day, isn't it?

168
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:52,525
So, so far has been a easy chair,

169
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:54,355
as you call it, politician.

170
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:57,495
And another thing that I discovered very funny there

171
00:08:57,675 --> 00:09:00,705
which now I understand why people are like this in this country,

172
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:03,425
also everywhere which, you see, you understand it better

173
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,525
when you are little away from that place.

174
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:09,145
So another thing I discovered was that this

175
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:12,135
cult called Christian ethics you can say

176
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:15,315
I hope you have not talked about, have you?  All right Now the

177
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,585
Christian ethics told me was really explained many things

178
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:19,615
why you behave like this.

179
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:23,685
Like one lady told me a story that there was a fellow

180
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:24,795
who had a

181
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:28,145
store of his own and he used very good locks, you see,

182
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:30,495
to secure it.

183
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:34,485
So the people protested saying that why did you lock your

184
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:37,385
things so well, you should have

185
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:39,095
given a chance for a burglar, you see,

186
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:43,485
after all you could insure yourself but why did you take away the chance of a burglar?

187
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:47,765
That kind of a Christian ethics works in our minds, you see.

188
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:51,385
So what we do, we sympathize with a bhoot all the time.

189
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,875
You see."Oh She is,Mother, so badly off,

190
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:57,535
she is like this". "Arey baba!she is a bhoot"

191
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,285
Didn't Modi tell you the saying of Ramadasa?

192
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:04,495
Sanggetla tumhi?(did you tell them?)

193
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:10,805
So Modi said this, there

194
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,465
which is Ramdas Swamy has said it," Pishacha means a bhoot of a style,

195
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:20,935
you see which sticks onto people, is pishacha.

196
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:24,115
So he says,"Pishacha mage pishacha gele",

197
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:27,325
after one bhoot another bhoot has gone.

198
00:10:28,615 --> 00:10:30,415
So who can go after that?

199
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:34,565
who can save that? I mean if they are going after the bhoot,

200
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,925
and what sarthak means- what will they achieve our of it?

201
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:41,095
The whole thing is that our mind

202
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:46,655
"oh he is very much,Mother, we must help that person, we must do this for that person."

203
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,415
All this Christian ethics is nonsensical.

204
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:52,655
But Christ never said, he took a big hunter

205
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:53,485
and beat all the people

206
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:57,475
who had bhoots and took them out and put them in the sea.

207
00:10:57,715 --> 00:11:00,815
So this is some sort of Christian is different from Christ,

208
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:03,785
so the Christian ethics is that always sympathize

209
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:06,285
with a person who is

210
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:07,865
a bhootish person.

211
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:11,505
Always! A bhootish person also has a method

212
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,465
of creating sympathies.

213
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,045
So today on New Year's day,

214
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:20,015
I think I should warn you certain things

215
00:11:20,015 --> 00:11:22,995
that I have realized after going to America.

216
00:11:22,995 --> 00:11:25,245
My human realization is improving.

217
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:39,585
I had seen once, you see, there was

218
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:42,915
lady who was

219
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:46,285
running a restaurant. And one thief,you see,

220
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:49,265
had stolen a coat from one restaurant and came to her

221
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:52,045
restaurant and would not pay the money

222
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,595
and she informed the police.

223
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:56,455
So the police said "Has he got a very good coat?" "Yes, she said "he has"

224
00:11:56,455 --> 00:11:59,495
"He's stolen from the other restaurant we've got the reports".

225
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:06,025
So the police came in. So they filed a suit against this man that he is a thief, he has stolen

226
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:09,535
a coat from there and ate food here, never paid anything.

227
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:13,765
So these people, both the restaurant people had to go to the court

228
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:16,585
and give evidence saying that,

229
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:19,545
you see, this fellow has stolen the coat

230
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:22,325
and he didn't pay for anything and he was quarelling.

231
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:26,825
And they have to spend two days and waste their money because they

232
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:29,195
earning out of their own restaurants.

233
00:12:29,575 --> 00:12:32,305
So the judge said,"Doesn't matter,

234
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:35,015
he was drunk at that time. So

235
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:38,085
he should be forgiven because he was drunk", firstly.

236
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:41,645
And secondly he was given money because he said,

237
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:44,635
"I have no money now with me to travel around",

238
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:47,625
while these people lost their money for two days. And the police

239
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:48,945
sat down with the hand like this.

240
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:52,285
So this kind of ethics that we have, you see,

241
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:55,245
is to sympathize always with bhoots, you see,

242
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:58,675
wrong doers. Even if you read the newspaper, you are shocked.

243
00:12:59,675 --> 00:13:03,615
How are they released on one point that they were in imbalance.

244
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:06,755
Because they were in imbalance, so they were released.

245
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:11,195
They are sent on a parole, that man goes and kills

246
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:14,345
ten people again, but because he was imbalanced.

247
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:17,635
So it is more necessary that you keep him, if he is imbalance,.

248
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:20,715
it is more necessary. To be imbalanced is

249
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:21,865
itself a sin,

250
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:24,635
itself is criminal.

251
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:29,005
If somebody is imbalanced, that means he is a criminal personality

252
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:32,125
and such a criminal personality must be kept in lock and key.

253
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:36,125
Like in France I saw, I was going by a bus;

254
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,535
now I understand many things, I didn't understand them before,

255
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:39,755
I must say.

256
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:42,415
So in France we were going by bus

257
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,155
and one person boxing he was talking

258
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:47,925
all kind of things. I said,"Oh God,

259
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:50,785
This one is only spilling bhoots from his mouth, who is he?"

260
00:13:50,785 --> 00:13:53,565
They said he is a man who was

261
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:54,955
talking about the war.

262
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:58,245
I was so shocked, I said this man is talking

263
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:01,305
about the war and these things, why is he allowed to come on a bus?

264
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:04,215
Then the second one came in, then a lady came in, they were all talking,

265
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,445
talking away something irrelevantly.

266
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:10,445
They said these are all people who have suffered

267
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:13,755
very much and they are coming into the bus

268
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:18,845
and that's why they are like this.

269
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:21,555
So I said,"But why allow this people to come in, in India

270
00:14:21,555 --> 00:14:24,275
nobody will allow such a person to come inside."

271
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:27,505
So I think Marie was there, she said "You see our government is

272
00:14:27,505 --> 00:14:30,385
very sympathetic,you see, towards such people."

273
00:14:30,385 --> 00:14:32,955
I said," But what about the rest of them? They are not

274
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,945
sympathetic about the other people, atleast they should be sometimes

275
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:38,955
for a change sympathetic with sane people."

276
00:14:38,955 --> 00:14:41,965
To have always sympathies with the insanity also shows

277
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:44,715
that you are encouraging all the bhootish people to develop,

278
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:46,305
to do what they like.

279
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:50,695
I mean this is no sympathy at all.

280
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:53,595
That is how this works out and I have seen

281
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:56,545
bhootish sympathy has also given Me lot of trouble.

282
00:14:57,175 --> 00:14:59,715
So you have to be little sympathetic

283
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,955
towards your poor Mother.

284
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,720
Now all sympathies of your bhoots must be given up.

285
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,400
Because that has given Me lot of trouble. throughout and now I understand why you people always sympathize with bhoot people.

286
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,080
Now, as it is, in England, it is a sin to awaken somebody in the morning.

287
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:27,840
I mean we have had big quarrels, fights, bouts, breaking of noses, everything because somebody woke up somebody in the morning time.

288
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,180
And people sympathize and came and told, “Mother, after all you see

289
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:40,840
this gentleman went and woke them up or the child started crying in the morning and that person got up in the morning”.

290
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,280
So it is a sinful thing in the West that if you wake up someone.

291
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:52,340
But, you see, you have to change yourself now, if you have to be Yogis, you must know that you cannot get easy chair,

292
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,040
yogi position.

293
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,500
Normally you have to go to Himalayas,

294
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,840
live in that cold, eat nothing for days together,

295
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,940
wash off all your desires, give up your wife, your children, everyone.

296
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,520
But Sahaja Yoga, so far has been, you can have your wife,

297
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,040
even if she is slightly bhootish, is all right.

298
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,460
But if she is very much bhootish, still I have to worry about the bhootish woman.

299
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,280
Even if she destroys Sahaja Yoga, doesn’t matter, the sympathies are there.

300
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,800
Even if she does anything, that’s a wife, after all.

301
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,020
Or a husband who is a bhootish, I get every time a letter that my husband is a bhootish man,

302
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,720
he beats me, he does this. Now, what am I to tell?

303
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,780
You divorce your husband, what should I say?

304
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,660
I mean, if he is bhootish, how can you be with a bhoot?

305
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,920
You are a realized soul and gradually what happens that you develop such a immunity with the bhoot

306
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,940
that you don’t know you have become yourself a big bhoot

307
00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:01,180
And you go on with that and this. Can you imagine we are creating here a race of yogis, of pure people.

308
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,120
Now, why people were going to Himalayas? Because there were no bhoots there.

309
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,900
You see, very few people went there, stayed away from the madding crowd.

310
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:16,300
You are staying in this horrible, hellish atmosphere,

311
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,600
where there are bhoots and bhoots, and bhoots, all kinds.

312
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,080
Now here it is more necessary that you should be very careful,

313
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:28,200
supposing, you see, plague breaks out,

314
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,080
any country, then how people become cautious?

315
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,880
They are so frightened that we should not catch anything from the plague, isn’t it?

316
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,860
In the same way we must know, now you are conscious of it.

317
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:47,840
But on the contrary this bhootish attachments are so great that I do not know how to fight it.

318
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,860
And the best part of it, you see, if you tell anybody, why did you do it, they say it is the bhoot who did.

319
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,760
But from where is he residing? In your own house.

320
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,540
Supposing in this house somebody is residing and he explodes the whole house,

321
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,880
will you say that the man who was residing has done it?

322
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,160
You have to blame yourself. Why do you allow a bhoot to be abide in you?

323
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,540
So today is a day, I mean yesterday’s day was a special day of Laxmi puja.

324
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,480
And you will be surprised in our house we put all the lights on.

325
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:26,540
And the candles were lit up. As soon as the candles were lit up all My this, My foot, went into a contortion absolutely.

326
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,760
It could not be brought to normal state. For at least half an hour we were struggling with it.

327
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:37,140
The reason is all the bhoots of London perhaps touched My feet. And they got into there… that “save us”.

328
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,300
So this is the situation is.

329
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,260
While you are not at all aware of it.

330
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:51,560
Now people think that you can compromise with righteousness,

331
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,980
with God. You cannot.

332
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:02,920
You cannot compromise. Whatever is pure has to be accepted in it's purity, in it's glory,

333
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,180
and one has to work hard for it.

334
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,000
You cannot just, you'll have your jobs, you’ll have your wives, you’ll eat your food,

335
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,140
the special type of things, you must have your comforts, you must have everything.

336
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,220
Is a first class journey to God,

337
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,880
and the bhoots along with it going towards God.

338
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,780
Everybody is in the baggage.

339
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:35,160
This is what one has to understand, we are yogis and we are people blessed specially

340
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,120
to elevate the whole world. We are responsible for the whole Western world.

341
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,340
And what are we doing about it? And I asked these people who have been to gurus,

342
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,540
I was amazed. Of course, money part was there, one thousand rupees each.

343
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:56,500
And they said that we are given food which nobody can eat. You get sick.

344
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:04,440
One lady told me that she ate such a food that she developed a horrible disease and – doctors told me that I first of all give up this food.

345
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,580
And you are forced to eat that food. And you have to wear very,

346
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:16,720
I mean, flimsy clothes and stand on the streets, sing songs,

347
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:23,140
walk in a procession, dance like a mad person, do all kind of things they do.

348
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,440
Here in Sahaja Yoga they said nothing, is a drawing room treatment.

349
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,580
But in the drawing room if you carry your bhoots also with you that’s not allowed.

350
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:44,740
That’s not allowed. So one has to understand that though we have got our realization

351
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:51,560
we have a very big responsibility and we have to move with that responsibility.

352
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:58,680
The greatest problem now of UK also France, I have seen. Because of drinking habits or whatever, it is – lethargy.

353
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:05,300
Excuses, brain is very… I tell you our Sahaja yogis also have tremendous brains.

354
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,380
I mean sometimes I don’t know how to work on their excuses.

355
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:14,540
“We had a public meeting which finished at eleven o’clock, so we couldn’t get up till eleven o’clock next day”.

356
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:21,160
Twelve hours sleep you must have. Very hard working people! But your Mother sleeps the same time and I am marathon

357
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,100
race runner, every night whenever, I mean you have only one program,

358
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:36,180
but then I go to Italy, I go to any place, I have regularly, the whole year I am doing this.

359
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:40,360
Still I get up early in the morning then why can’t you get up?

360
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,080
All excuses are there, this is an excuse another is an excuse

361
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,400
and then I have told so many people that just get up at about four o’clock in the morning.

362
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,840
Just get up, try and see and do it. It’s very good, four o’clock I’ve been saying for the last ten years now.

363
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,840
I don’t how many of you have tried that.

364
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:03,540
Have your bath, get ready, have your bath

365
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,040
and then sit down for meditation.

366
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,520
The whole day will pass out very well and sleep at about 8 o’clock.

367
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:17,400
It is English saying that ‘early to bed and early to rise’. But I have never seen any Englishman like that so far.

368
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,440
It is the other way round. They’ll keep awake till one o’clock

369
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,100
and get up at about eleven o’clock or ten o’clock;

370
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:33,080
will not even brush their teeth and walk out. These habits you have to change, we are yogis and we have to worship the Sun.

371
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,020
So we have to get up much before the Sun rise.

372
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,300
That is very important.

373
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,700
But I find that is not here.

374
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:51,600
People don’t understand. They want to take Sahaja Yoga in a very slow way and you will move very slowly and so many of you will drop out I tell you.

375
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,040
One must understand! Today is a new year’s day and we must understand what are we doing.

376
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,500
This is a real warning to all of you.

377
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,540
You just try, this is not a very big thing; you will be amazed now.

378
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:11,220
CP is having a conference for twenty days, every day he gets up at four thirty,

379
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,680
every day, sleeps at twelve o’clock, every day the whole day he is working.

380
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,600
Twenty days after all he says “once in a while I have to work hard”.

381
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:26,400
Our servant gets up at five thirty every day, who works very hard.

382
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:34,520
Why can’t you get up? You people think that you are the most unhealthy people or what is the reason?

383
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:44,300
Every time you say ‘haaah’. What’s wrong with you? Nothing is wrong, you are lazy lumps that’s all, you should understand.

384
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:53,020
Just tell yourself you are lazy, extremely lazy and we have been brought up like this and this comes from your ego, for your information.

385
00:23:53,020 --> 00:24:00,400
Ego thinks, thinks, thinks, justifies everything, makes you weak and then you sleep like logs of woods.

386
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,740
What is going to happen?

387
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,600
This is tamasa, complete tamasa; ego is taking you to tamasa.

388
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:17,560
Or when you are not inactive, then what we do is to ride a big horse, John Gilpins, we met so many.

389
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:31,200
I went to Toronto, there is one John Gilpin. Mr. Patrick. Was a real John Gilpin, without any single pie he became a big administrator of money, this that.

390
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,240
Then I find here, Mr. Jason is touched by him. This is another John Gilpin, I call them what you call…

391
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,540
James Bonds.

392
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:48,860
They are riding such horses. So there is one group which is extremely

393
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:54,840
fundamentalist about lethargy. You see, they know all the excuses,

394
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,060
how to say to Mother “oh! this is so, we have this problem this that”.

395
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:04,800
The another group is this, riding the high horse.

396
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:10,340
“Mother I have to still clear out, this is the problem”. What are you doing about it?

397
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,340
Let us face ourselves!

398
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,040
Are we going to lag behind?

399
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,440
You know, on a ship you have to get on to the gangway at least.

400
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,502
If you move so slowly, gangway will be lifted and the ship will move out, I’m telling you.

401
00:25:25,502 --> 00:25:29,700
So one has to understand and we have to work something for Sahaj.

402
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:40,980
Sahaja Yoga should be first priority. Job is first priority, making money is first priority, or wife or children, all these are much more important.

403
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,540
Then go ahead with it.

404
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:48,440
Marriages, another is marriage.”Mother when am I going to” People will eat my head for that also.

405
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,900
“When am I going to get married, what should I do, whom should I marry, do that” These things are not going to take you higher.

406
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,060
Where should be your attention?

407
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,540
Those who are married are troublesome, those who are not married are troublesome.

408
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,380
Those who are married have problems, and those who are not married.

409
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,940
So the marriage doesn’t solve the problem of Sahaja Yoga.

410
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,700
Now they’ll say “but we…” Excuse is there. “We must create children”. All right. Which children?

411
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,320
“Children, which will be realized souls”. Do you think realized souls will be born to lazy lumps?

412
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,520
They’ll keep them morning till evening if they are born, I tell you!

413
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:37,940
So one has to understand that either you are lazy and when you are active you are

414
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:45,100
James Bonds. Nothing in between. And that’s how people have been avoiding taking responsibility. Excuses.

415
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:52,260
The whole brain system is such how to give excuse which is anti our progress.

416
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,720
It’s destructive, this will destroy you.

417
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,380
This is destructive.

418
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:07,980
And this tamasa has to be conquered by willpower. But if I’ll say willpower then suddenly I find ten James Bonds standing before me – “Now what?”

419
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:14,120
Your poor Mother is blasted. Oh God! Now what am I to do?

420
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:20,780
So I don’t know which way to go. Now if you tell somebody that you have got some catches,

421
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:27,520
you go and look after yourself, go away from here. Then that person starts thinking that

422
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:36,100
“I am the person who is to be like an outcast” and indulges into all kinds of miserable existences.

423
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,900
It is said that you go and get yourself alright, and cleaned up.

424
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,160
Instead of that, person is the most miserable person and the slightest pretext, you see,

425
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,560
you find the person thinks he is in hell.

426
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:53,940
Now what to do with such people. You just tell me what is the solution for these people.

427
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:59,440
Now I am already sixty years of age, how long do you want me to live I don’t know.

428
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,100
But whatever it is you have to now get up.

429
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:11,120
Neither to be aggressive nor to be sleeping.

430
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,260
And this sleeping business has to go away. Now in the ashram people stay here. Anywhere.

431
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,040
There is no discipline in our ashram. You go and ask them what sort of ashram’s they have.

432
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:28,720
3.30 one has to get up and then what do they do? You have to clean all the compound, 3.30 in the morning in New York,

433
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,860
which is the coldest place. You see a lady told me, she is a very rich lady. She told me “3.30 I had to get up

434
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,680
and clean the whole compound

435
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:45,940
and planting all the things and that was sold by the guru and all the money was taken by the guru himself.”

436
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,840
So the whole business was how to make the guru prosperous

437
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:58,280
and they had to get up early in the morning and go on working it out, one after another.

438
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,780
There were two people who came from Rajneesh

439
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:08,460
with the same dress, you see. So these people told them that you can’t come to Mother’s program with this dress.

440
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:15,220
So they said we have only these two pairs of this dress and one mala left with us. The rest is all gone to guru

441
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:24,120
for his Rolls Royces. So we have nothing left. Only this much we have left. So I said “All right baba, we will give you money now, but change this dress”.

442
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,480
This is the situation. That is how the gurus extract them.

443
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,420
But we do not try. How far have we gone? You must think now, somebody

444
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:42,360
who is a left sided person should think how far we have gone now, as our left sidedness is concerned.

445
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:51,180
Those who are right sided should think how far we have gone, how far in the center we have come and then think of the ascent.

446
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,040
Sahaja Yoga is simple, made easy, all right.

447
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,840
Supposing I have cooked for you, all right, you have to eat it, digest it and use that for something.

448
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:11,760
This cooking is done for the good of others. But people think of their family, house, children this, that, all these comforts.

449
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:27,840
So one has to really, dedicatedly, absolutely understand that our worth is much more than any one of these people put together.

450
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,660
I’ll say my husband is working like this, I am seeing it and I am surprised.

451
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:39,820
4.30 he gets up and yesterday we had a dinner till 12 o’clock. He was so alert and talking to them in such an alert way, to these Chinese.

452
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,280
And every day he is doing that.

453
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,840
How does he do it?

454
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,600
You know that when I sleep also I am working; when I am awake I am working.

455
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,300
All the time I am working. All right! you might say Mother you are Adi Shakti.

456
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:03,160
But this my husband is not even a realized soul, like you people are.

457
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,620
There are so many like that.

458
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,000
And he is not aggressive by any chance.

459
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,460
So once they start working, they start thinking how to make money out of Sahaja Yoga, just imagine!

460
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,900
Selling candles, selling this. What are these other side of it?

461
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,560
I mean you cannot sell Sahaja Yoga.

462
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:32,020
That is one thing I want to tell you and proclaim today that anybody tries to do such a thing I’ll liquidate that person

463
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,500
and make him a pukka pauper.

464
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,120
First of all you will get sick if you try to sell Sahaja Yoga.

465
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:46,840
Nobody has to do such things. You have to keep that side extremely clear cut, you cannot sell anything.

466
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:53,860
Also, whatever I am talking you cannot sell it in the market. Many people have this habit of selling it out.

467
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:58,840
Now somebody is writing a poetry about Rama, what is the need to publish that poetry?

468
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,780
What has it got to do with Sahaja Yoga? I am living here. You are writing about Rama.

469
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,640
What is the need?

470
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,540
And who wants to hear that? Just think of it.

471
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:16,920
Gregoire said, “Mother we want to publish your lectures and why are they publishing somebody’s poetry there

472
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:23,240
about Rama?” Is this the job we are going to do?

473
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:31,740
What is our job? Is to give realizations to others, spread Sahaja Yoga, keep ourselves pure,

474
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:38,400
At a higher level become those great personalities, you see, which have achieved something.

475
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:44,200
Learn music. I told you learn music, learn dancing, learn something by which you can manifest Sahaja Yoga.

476
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:54,280
Otherwise, I don’t know what’s going to happen to you and to Sahaja Yoga in the West

477
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,620
because there is no education or discipline

478
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,300
here. We are free people, do what we like.

479
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,300
We have to discipline ourselves. And now as you are newly born, you can do it.

480
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:15,100
You have to discipline, “how dare I do these things, I am a Sahaja yogi”.

481
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,200
We have to take ourselves to task first of all.

482
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:29,280
This is a very, very important thing and I find that is lacking so much. And you know this disease of lethargy

483
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,200
or of high handedness is so contagious.

484
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:39,040
Mr. Patrick met Jason for five minutes he clicked him, Mr. Jason met another one, he clicked him

485
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,640
and if I find a link, you know, it is there.

486
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,200
One lady like Jane, she meets somebody, she becomes bhootish.

487
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,360
She becomes bhootish,then another person… You can link it back.

488
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:58,080
You’ll be amazed, how these things work out. They have a chain reaction.

489
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:05,740
So one has to be careful. But why not see to the person who is doing something about it,

490
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,980
who is rising higher, who is dynamic.

491
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,420
I know who are there.

492
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,000
They are the people I have now said these are your leaders,

493
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,500
but some of them still go like that.

494
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:34,420
You must assume your powers; that’s the point I’ve been saying. We have to assume our powers, we have to be wise people, grown up, matured;

495
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,620
we cannot play like children with ourselves.

496
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:46,280
And this is what has been said many a times, but now whatever I’ve said it you put it in your action.

497
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:53,660
Fight with yourself. Don’t give excuses. There are excuses and excuses which you tell me I said “All right”.

498
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:57,040
But, you see, I have another nature which you have not realized

499
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,040
I can recede!

500
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:08,180
My interest is up to a point. What can I do? After some time like a glue, you know, it falls off.

501
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:15,040
A glue can stick you to a point. If you get stuck well and good, otherwise it will fall off.

502
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,140
So that recession should not start in my mind.

503
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,040
So please be alert

504
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:37,180
and don’t worry what other problems you have. Also I have seen that there are forces working like this.

505
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,980
Now, somebody wants to do something, because he wants to do it you should not cut it out.

506
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,900
On principle if it is good you should say “Go ahead, we are with you”.

507
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:53,740
And that’s why, I see, people don’t work out. Like getting an ashram – any place will work out if everybody has positive attitude,

508
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,920
if somebody is trying for that. Every collective thing. But everybody will say:

509
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:05,580
“But, you see, if you take the ashram then who will pay for it? We are only five people.”

510
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,640
But Mother is there to look after you.

511
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,900
Then will be another excuse something coming up that:

512
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:20,200
“You see, if you take the ashram there could be such and….” But you just take it first of all and see for yourself.

513
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:28,860
Like you start driving and you say: “All right. We are going this way, but there could be a jam”. But let us see if there is or not.

514
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:35,840
Before hand how are you saying? I mean before facing the situation there will be ten suggestions immediately coming like a cock.

515
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,940
Jack in the box suddenly will start, you see, giving their wise advice,

516
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:54,980
cutting the legs of the people who are trying to do something. It’s a very common experience I have had with Myself also.

517
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:01,020
We are going now, see, in the car; I mean throughout America I have been telling people, “Now will you please shut up.

518
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,240
Will you please now understand, let us do it.”

519
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:16,040
They decided to have a program after this program was over.

520
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,940
It was in, I think, Vancouver.

521
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:26,280
And I said all right then call them also for puja because we have no time now to wait till they grew up and all that; call them for puja.

522
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:32,800
And I said come and have lunch also. They’ve got a fright!, “Mother we have not made any arrangements”. I said, “What is there, we will make chola”.

523
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,860
We have no cholas, how to soak it? I said “Don’t you worry.”

524
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:41,800
I told them, “Let us go to some Indian restaurant here and we’ll get the chola. They said “it’s not possible Mother, who will…?”.

525
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,020
I said “But let us go, I’m saying let us go”. There was a discussion about it for about half an hour.

526
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:53,320
“Oh! Mother is saying but how to..?” I said, “Will you please take me to some Indian restaurant, anywhere?”

527
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,700
“Oh we have to drive about 3 miles.” I said, “Doesn’t matter”.

528
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:02,060
“It’s already 11.30 it will be 12 o’clock by the time we go there, there won’t be anybody”.

529
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,720
I said, “I am telling you take me to some Indian restaurant, why don’t you take?”

530
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,620
And the argument was on and on. I said, “Now, will you take Me…?” I felt like taking a pistol.

531
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,240
And now, I said, “Hands up. Let’s…”

532
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:23,160
And when I insisted too much then very reluctantly they drove Me down.

533
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:30,380
There was a restaurant there, I said, “Now go inside and tell this man that we want five kilos of this

534
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,360
cholas with you if you have got chana.”

535
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,520
So he said “I have got it.” They said, “Better get it for us”. So he sold us.

536
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,440
And he said, “I don’t know why I am selling it you, I never do that way, but I am selling it to you”.

537
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:49,480
And he gave us. And then he said “There’s a shop here” And he asked the person to open the shop

538
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:55,100
and he gave us all the rest of it and next day we had a nice cholas. I’ve made them for them.

539
00:38:55,100 --> 00:39:01,540
So we had it. But before starting they really, I tell you, they ate my head off.

540
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,760
Same in Toronto, Toronto was much worse.

541
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,860
Much worse. Everywhere I found this is the thing. You try to do something.

542
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:14,300
Now you have to take this ashram. There will be ten wise people immediately sitting

543
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,680
“But for this how can we do it?” Then you don’t have it.

544
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:29,480
All these explanations and all these things are not wanted. If you have any positive things to do, you do it.

545
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,840
The thing is, is more talking and doing nothing is the point.

546
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:43,120
Action is to be taken instead of that inaction, in such a way that it’s only thought, thought, thought, thought, thought

547
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:52,320
and everybody’s talking. But the system where one person talks and the rest listen always works out like in Japan, in India,

548
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,740
if an elder is talking, nobody talks. All right! If Mother says so, All right. Go ahead”.

549
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:05,880
I mean Gagangan Maharaj asked these people Modi and all that “Will you jump in the sea if Mother says so?

550
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,360
Are you willing to die for Her?” I mean this is the first question a guru asks, you see?

551
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:16,160
Here, dying? Only driving up to three miles you have to break your neck with them.

552
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,940
Dying is too much!

553
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:26,360
I cannot even talk of that. But even for everything it is happening and that’s why Sahaja Yoga doesn’t work out.

554
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:35,000
And those people who try to do something, either there is jealousy or pulling him down or the wise counseling.

555
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,980
“If you do it who will pay for it?” There is Mother sitting, She will look after.

556
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:49,500
“You should not take the ashram on hire, this will be too much for us”. Everything, if it is free is very good.

557
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:54,700
Now these are the two points I am saying the third point also I have to tell you and then I’ll tell you the good news.

558
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:10,220
Now the third point which is very important one has to understand about third point.

559
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:17,940
It’s a very small thing but expresses in a big way in everybody’s life.

560
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,840
Now, you people are much more affluent than Indians are,

561
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:33,020
but the amount of headaches I have with Sahaja Yogis about money I’ve never had in India which I must tell you very frankly.

562
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:39,360
First we had the ashram, you know in Dollis Hill for which I don’t know how much money I had to shell out.

563
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,700
I think thousand five hundred or something.

564
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,440
Second ashram we had, we had to sell out, again there.

565
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:55,040
Now third ashram we had I think here also I had to do it. The reason is there is no proper account. Nobody knows how much money is there in the bank or not.

566
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,880
And everybody is trying to save if possible at the cost of Sahaja Yoga.

567
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,760
I mean this is such a low thing to talk about but it is so.

568
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:13,380
Everybody sees to one’s own personal comfort but not to the whole working of Sahaja Yoga.

569
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,540
Like so many have not even paid the rent.

570
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:23,440
I mean are we going to go in litigation now, I mean, these people who have not even paid the rent?

571
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,700
I mean just think of it, you have not even paid the rent.

572
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:32,900
Like in Dollis Hill they never paid the electricity, who is going to pay? Mother will pay, She does everything for us.

573
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:37,620
You see Mother is looking after us, isn’t it? So let Her pay for the electricity.

574
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:43,340
Now here it is that people have not paid the rent.

575
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:52,120
But for Dharma, for this great work, you have to donate. No question of paying for your rent, you have to donate. Do you understand?

576
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,860
That is one of the principles of Lakshmi.

577
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,320
These people have not understood this. You have to donate for this work.

578
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:14,080
You just think that Sahaja Yoga is for your advantage, all right, for spiritual advantage.

579
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:21,600
But you do not take advantage of Sahaja Yoga this way. In India I never had this problem of money, I can tell you, this way, never.

580
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,100
On the contrary, whenever there was a problem they stood by Me.

581
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:31,560
Australia, same thing I must say, Australia has never given Me any problem of money

582
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,560
that I have to pay out of my pocket.

583
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:43,840
Here the people have not paid the rent. Now those who have not paid the rent let… raise your hands.

584
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,880
Honestly. So far. In the ashram.

585
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:51,900
Everyone has paid?

586
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,200
Shri Mataji: How much?

587
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,500
Sahaja Yogi: Seven pounds

588
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,400
Shri Mataji: That’s all, that’s not much; but it’s eight hundred pounds.

589
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,560
One must pay for Sahaja Yoga. Lavishly. You are staying here, pay for that.

590
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:19,020
You see, I have seen people, just turn their faces. You are staying here. Free food is very good idea,

591
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,400
if you can get even free lodging, London very good.

592
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:29,940
You have come for the program, so what? You have come here, now there’s food, is all, pay for that.

593
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:36,500
You must pay. You don’t understand today is the day of Diwali

594
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:41,660
where people have to pay to God, God’s work.

595
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:47,880
Because Lakshmi tattwa is like that.

596
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,840
You don’t have to pay the guru. Thank God! You have free guru here.

597
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,700
Only 5p this time I took, isn’t it?

598
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:05,800
But you have to pay, not only for yourself but for your work. You don’t even pay for yourself, you stay here free of food.

599
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:14,880
Think people have not paid for food. Many a times it happened. They don’t even pay for the hall, one pound can you imagine?

600
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:21,220
You try to save that one pound and you will be losing thousands of pounds, I tell you. Don’t do like that.

601
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:29,400
This is God’s work, don’t take advantage of it. And it was very far, very far I’ve seen.

602
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:36,900
We used to have one Indian who would come to our pujas and he would buy things for the puja. Gavin is here, he’ll tell you.

603
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:44,900
And it was impossible to pay him that money for that puja things that he bought. He said this much my punya.

604
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:51,140
Even CP understands that very well. He says this is the only way I’m doing some punya. After all what punya I’m doing.

605
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,280
While we try to save money out of Sahaja Yoga – is a very dangerous thing. Now, so far everything forgiven.

606
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:08,720
Why I don’t declare Myself to be Adi Shakti because once I declare Myself as Adi shakti,

607
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,420
none of the sins will be forgiven, take it from Me.

608
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:24,880
Is a very serious thing. All of them will be alert, is already said. That’s why I don’t say I am Adi Shakti, better keep at a lower level,

609
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,840
so that at least you have given a chance.

610
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:41,060
There is a mess of money everywhere. How can it be with all of you so good, so intelligent, giving wise advice everywhere?

611
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:48,840
And most of it is miserliness. It’s so sickening, you know, to see a saint to be miserly, I’ve said hundred times,

612
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,340
a saint cannot be a miserly person.

613
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:58,380
That’s one of the signs of a saint is that he cannot be miserly. So much thinking of money.

614
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,060
“If you can go this way one pound you can save”.

615
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:08,480
The money mindedness is so much. I have seen it every day, you see people used to work with me.

616
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,200
“We are not buying that paint because if we use the whole of the bottle then we cannot return it”.

617
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,220
I mean to that extent what was the need to bother?

618
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,720
I mean the mind is such.

619
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:34,820
So don’t save that kind of a thing. Labour saving devices, money saving devices, you see, are very well built in, very clever people.

620
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:40,920
But they are all against you. You are so clever that you are cheating yourself.

621
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:50,140
Don’t cheat yourself. Be careful. You are special people, you have to achieve special results with yourself;

622
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:55,420
you can do a lot but these are the things you should be careful.

623
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:05,340
Everyone who keeps the accounts, who sends the money, who pays the money, has to be careful also.

624
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:12,080
And also the people who are taking advantage of Sahaja Yoga should be.

625
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,780
There are many books which I have given to people I don’t know when did they sell.

626
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:21,640
Except for Gavin I don’t think anybody has given me a proper account of the books that were given to him.

627
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,600
Somebody asked me for ten, twenty, I just trusted, I trust people.

628
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:37,900
Or if they could buy, you see, one Nirmala Yoga. “Oh we can share Mother about hundred people can have Nirmala Yoga, it’s all right”.

629
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:46,700
Yes, that’s very common, imagine Nirmala Yoga costs you three pound per year,

630
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:53,540
used by hundred people, economical. But that’s the Bible.

631
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:03,000
Nobody has the sense what we are going to collect. They’ll collect coins,

632
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:10,680
they’ll collect I don’t know what, stamps, I don’t know what else they are collecting here, quite mad people.

633
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,300
But why not collect Nirmala Yoga?

634
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:23,200
I mean, I read it, Myself I read my own articles, every time I find a new message.

635
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:29,260
Why people have one Nirmala Yoga going round and round and round. One Nirmala Yoga I saw once,

636
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:36,120
here in the, all torn, tattered this thing and I could see all the hands that have been laid on it.

637
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,520
Because If you can save three pounds per year why not do it, we’ll have the Nirmala Yoga as well.

638
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:52,040
Same thing about tapes, Mother’s tapes, all right! “If you have one, can you lend me?”

639
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,740
By the time it ends up, there is nothing left on the tape.

640
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:06,980
Is this the way to come to God? To the generous of generous. There is no place for such a people.

641
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:11,980
God doesn’t like miserly people to enter into His kingdom.

642
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:16,640
And when you have money. I would say that if you are poor people who are starving.

643
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:26,940
When I started my work in Bombay they all said, “Mother, how will You do it alone?” I said ”I’ll manage don’t you worry.”

644
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:33,640
And they said “We want to give you money”. I said “I don’t want. Just now there is no trust, nothing, let us form a trust”.

645
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:39,880
When the trust started also you must know that I paid lot of money for the trust, Myself.

646
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:45,560
We started the trust, in trust we started paying.

647
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:52,280
Then, when we had established properly I said now you can pay.

648
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,700
That year

649
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:14,520
that moment when I was sitting there I said now I want money, there were not so many Sahaja Yogis, fifteen thousand rupees,

650
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:18,200
collected that moment I was sitting there.

651
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:25,300
“What did you do?” “Mother, we didn’t do anything.” “Did you sell any ornament?” “Nothing.” “Then how?”

652
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:31,800
“We had collected, because you had said that you will be asking some time. We have got it.” Cash, they brought.

653
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:37,980
Fifteen thousand. In one sitting, just like this I was talking, said fifteen thousand.

654
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:44,500
And they saw to it, that paid. Here it is just on the meeting they’ll say, all right, we will pay fifteen thousand tomorrow, day after.

655
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:50,020
A person has to go after you to ask for money like a tax collector.

656
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:59,160
This is absurd. “Mother I’ve got a very good house, I’ve got a very good wife, come and visit my house, I’ll be very happy”.

657
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:06,420
What have you done for the Big House? You got your own house, all the blessings, what have you done for the Big House?

658
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:16,500
One must understand that these are symbolic things which express your temperament, your nature.

659
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:21,280
When you are taking drugs you are spending so much money for drugs because you are addicted to it.

660
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,540
Why not get addicted to Sahaja Yoga?

661
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:32,080
How many of you are addicted to Sahaja Yoga? Raise your hands. Raise your hands.

662
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:37,280
At least promise me from today you are all going to be Sahaja Yoga addicted.

663
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,440
Come along, raise your hands, all of you. So this is the good news.

664
00:52:52,280 --> 00:53:01,640
So, New Year has started and it’s a beautiful thing, this year has to be something special.

665
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:08,320
The first thing I was thinking about the school that you are going to establish

666
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:14,720
and which is going to help you and your children very much, to begin with.

667
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,980
And then we’ll be having different ashrams and different places.

668
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,640
Another good news is that we have now got the land

669
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:33,340
near the Neera river where you jumped into that river and the photograph of that time when you jumped in, is just like this in the sky, you find,

670
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:40,300
the light all going on the sides with rays, it’s wonderful – as you see of the Holy Ghost, exactly like that.

671
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,340
It’s a photograph.

672
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:50,360
It was with Dhumal I think, it was an instant photograph. So

673
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:57,500
that land we have got where you all can have your huts, nicely done, for all of you.

674
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:05,140
It’s already arranged. It’s a beautiful spot, we’re all going to have that nice time.

675
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:12,360
And our old age is now being completely secured, so don’t worry about the old age, don’t try to save for your old age.

676
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:29,860
Now we are going to India for which we have got two programs and

677
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:34,860
please try to make it easier for Me. Don’t make it difficult.

678
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:41,020
And if you make it easier for Me it’s better for Me because even if I have to worry about everything then it’s difficult.

679
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:46,640
Like, we are thinking to have you on a plane which will bring you there in time.

680
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,600
Now you can imagine you come at a time whenever you feel like at random,

681
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:59,240
you want to go back at a time when you want to go. There should be some understanding that taking you to the airport

682
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:06,300
from any place takes about thousand rupees sometimes and who is going pay for it? Extra?

683
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:11,720
But you want to go to the aeroplane. You must tell Mother, “I have to go, I have to catch the plane, what am I to do?”

684
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:19,240
Now, that’s not the way. This time all of you are going by one plane and coming back by one plane.

685
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:26,320
We cannot have buses for each and individual persons and you know how taxis are expensive in India.

686
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:33,260
We cannot arrange that. We’ll try to make most of you arrive at a time when there will be a bus.

687
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:40,460
Moreover, if there is an arrangement that is possible we might be able to get a proper concession from Air India

688
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:46,260
so that when you come back, mostly now Delhi we are not going, so it won’t happen to that extent I am sure.

689
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:54,480
Like merchants you see and carrying luggage, every person two hundred kilos

690
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:05,360
will be lessened of course, also Air India will be kind enough to help us out with little extra luggage.

691
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:12,080
But the way people carry their luggage sometimes it’s… I can’t understand.

692
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:22,060
Two hundred kilos were given once upon a time to me extra by Air India because of CP’s position whatever it is

693
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:31,640
and that was also used by Sahaja Yogis. Then all my things were left there and they just walked off with my luggage concession

694
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:37,820
and those things had to come by ship or by some other people for whom I had to pay a lot, doesn’t matter.

695
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:46,940
Whatever has happened is the past so forget the past. But in the new life, you should not have all the filth of the old life.

696
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:53,500
So every year one has to jump out on to a better life,

697
00:56:53,500 --> 00:57:00,040
a life of magnanimity, of sublimity, of spirituality.

698
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:06,260
And of spirituality means no sympathy at all for a bhoot!

699
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,960
That’s one thing is definite, no sympathy!

700
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:19,380
This should be decided today that you will have no sympathy for any bhootish person.

701
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:25,420
Because when he sits on your head then you start saying Mother this has happened, but when you give sympathy to that person

702
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:31,940
you don’t understand that you have been doing these things to a person who is anti God. All bhoots are anti God

703
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:37,700
whether they are in you or outside. So fight them out in you or outside.

704
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:42,280
Don’t allow any bhoots to be dominating,

705
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:54,440
and once you understand this point that they are against God and you are the instruments of God, you have nothing to do with them, you will get rid of them.

706
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,600
Once you become firm, they just run away.

707
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:09,800
So this second resolution has to be passed today that we’ll have no sympathies with bhootish people and will not give funny council by which you stop the work.

708
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,520
Many people are bhootish that way, I know that. Anything you tell them,

709
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:19,260
like Channe, I said let us start a school. “Oh, how can we do it, this is this, this is that”.

710
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:26,460
I said in Geneva “You start taking that big place.” Many people came with great council,

711
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:30,980
I know everything what has happened, you may not tell me. I am not there, but I am there.

712
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:35,540
I know all those people who tried these tricks, because they think they are very wise.

713
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:43,300
At this time I am there to watch you and see you, but I witness you. But you will drop out.

714
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:49,340
This is the point. Everything is recorded. Whatever you are doing. God has a registration office

715
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:56,140
and how many marks you get is very important. You don’t think that you have been given realization,

716
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:01,700
such a big position; then God is not watching you. He is watching your every step.

717
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:09,860
There are angels with you to help you and there are Ganas with you, but also the registration office is registered.

718
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:15,120
So be careful. Then later on you will say that Mother I’ve missed the bus.

719
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:20,220
There I can’t do any hanky panky, I tell you, at that point. I cannot do anything.

720
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:28,460
Only thing just now whatever is possible I can do it, so please work it out in such a way that you really ascend fast

721
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:32,760
and this is today you decide.

722
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:37,360
Tonight. How many are going to get up tomorrow at four o’clock, raise your hands.

723
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:46,880
And have their baths before puja and of course everything.

724
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,380
Not only bath, otherwise they’ll say “we had the baths, so it’s all right”. No.

725
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:56,180
But in proper dresses you have to be there in time.

726
00:59:56,180 --> 01:00:02,220
Actually so many times I come late because I know they must not have yet got up.

727
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:09,500
What’s the use of reaching there? Then when I reach they say “Mother stop, still is not yet done, we have not arranged.”

728
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:15,100
It has happened many a time, so you don’t blame Me for coming late, it’s just to give you facilities.

729
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:18,300
I think that is better to go late so that there’s no problem.

730
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:32,060
So the good news I have told you already that we are going to get beautiful huts for ourselves.

731
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:37,320
I would like you people to give Me some good designs for your huts that you want to buy.

732
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:42,220
It will be at a very, very nominal cost, but don’t try to save there. You see, is the saving of savings.

733
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:49,980
Like this $400 actually I did it under a wrong impression. I didn’t know that it was $375 last year.

734
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:54,340
I thought it was only 300 so I said hundred rupees sufficient to increase. Now they are all called, shocked,

735
01:00:54,340 --> 01:01:00,500
“Mother, what are you doing, how can it be? The prices have gone doubled now.” I said “Somehow or other I will manage. Don’t you worry.”

736
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:10,060
But in the hut business also you must know you have to pay for your hut, you cannot get it free there.

737
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:17,840
Or, “Mother it’s all right, one person will build and we’ll come every year, we can share.

738
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:23,820
It’s all right, you make one hut for us, ten persons can share it”.

739
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:30,440
This kind of beggaring should not be expressed there. It’s quite common here, “we’ll share it, it’s all right”.

740
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,900
But where are you going to spend your money that saving all this?

741
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:39,600
You won’t shave because you want to save money, you won’t go to a hairdresser you want to save money, all right!

742
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:46,580
Now you don’t want to pay for your food, because you want to save money, you don’t want to pay your rent because you want to save money, but for what?

743
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:51,400
I can understand drunkards doing that because, you see, miserly people are around because they are drunkards you know.

744
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:56,720
Drunkards always have to save money because they have to drink. But you are no more drunkards now?

745
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:03,980
So why should you save? Only drunkards do like that, you see this miserliness is very much in England and all the places.

746
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:07,900
It’s reason, because they have to drink, you know, where will they get the money to drink.

747
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:12,840
So they save all their money for drinking. But you are not drunkards any more.

748
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:16,780
And the thing that you are drinking is the nectar which is free.

749
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:19,920
So why are you saving all the time your money?

750
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:31,760
So money making propositions and money saving proposition if they brought little low you’ll be amazed that these are all joy killing.

751
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:40,600
Bhoots are joy killing things. A bhootish woman if she is next to Me, you see, I want to run away, can’t bear her.

752
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:47,060
The reason is she’s so joy killing, she’ll go on saying “Mother, what is happening about my marriage now?

753
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:51,580
My husband has not written any letter to me.” Finished. I’m saying – “Now, fed up of her.”

754
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:59,260
Then another will talk “Mother my house is not all right, what am I to do? My business is not working out, what am I to do?”

755
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:05,140
All very personal petty things they’ll discuss. Not of higher things.

756
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:14,740
But in America I was so much happier that they never asked Me about personal problems – no one.

757
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:24,360
Always talked about the higher thing. “But how is it, Mother? This is the Spirit, when it comes into you how is it the light is not spread so well?”

758
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:34,000
They talked about Spirit, Spirit, Spirit. Nobody said “My husband is like this, my house is sinking, what am I to do? I have problems”.

759
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,280
They never talked like that, so they’ll go much faster

760
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:47,200
and you will stay stick on with your wives, children and your house and maybe I don’t know what else here.

761
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:53,120
So be careful. Move your attention to higher levels.

762
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:57,500
Unless and until you move your attention to higher levels how will you jump out?

763
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:12,660
And this is another way you can give a lift to the newcomers also. You see, many newcomers are shocked by the Sahaja Yogis the way they are.

764
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,020
They say “there is no difference.

765
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:21,620
They tell lies, they try to save money at our cost”. New people have come, all right! Are you a married man?

766
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:26,700
Then they say “all right! You pay for today.” We go to a hotel, he pays for them.

767
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:31,280
The new man is shocked. All the Sahaja yogis eat there, poor fellow he pays money.

768
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,880
He is without any money; then he thinks what sort of Sahaja yogis these are, they are making me pay.

769
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:42,360
When a new person comes you all should pay. But if they know somebody has money then they take out the money.

770
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,460
This is a horrible thing to hear.

771
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:51,960
And the whole problem is of money, “my husband doesn’t give me the money, he keeps the money at the bank, my wife doesn’t give me money”.

772
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:57,620
I am fed up of all these talks. Now no more after this, at least don’t tell Me.

773
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:04,580
If you want I can give you two sticks, you hit your husband or your wife, finish it off. I have nothing to say,

774
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:08,900
but don’t tell Me about them.

775
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:13,500
And if your wife is a bhoot or a husband is a bhoot keep her out.

776
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:20,140
Don’t take a headache on yourself. And those who are marrying because they’re in-love with bhoots better give up.

777
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:27,580
Otherwise, their love affairs, and this and that, all sorts of things, I am so fed up with it!

778
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:30,780
When are we going to talk about the eternal life?

779
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:42,860
All right? So, I think for New Year we have had a little pep talk and a love talk and good news

780
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:49,240
maybe we may be allowed to stay here if you all desire, if you do not give some wise counseling,

781
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,760
I am sure we’ll stay here.

782
01:05:53,220 --> 01:06:03,140
All right, when shifting here also there were lot of wise counseling, “It’s very far away, what should we do, this, that” It worked out.

783
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:11,080
Keep your wisdom to yourself, work it out on yourself. Try to find out about yourself through your own wisdom – “What am I doing?”

784
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:16,600
And you’ll be amazed how it will help you. You have to shine. You are the leaders of tomorrow.

785
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:25,220
You have to have your wings on. What are you doing?

786
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:29,180
All these heavy loads throw them away – nothing important!

787
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:36,680
Feel lighter. You have given up all that. Now we are yogis,

788
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:42,100
we are sanyasis, what is going to matter with us, even if you don’t get food, so what?

789
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:45,480
God is going to look after us. He looks after us.

790
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:58,700
And it is happened with people that they have all settled down very well those who have faith in their yoga,

791
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:02,860
they get their kshema all right. First look after your yoga, is important.

792
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:11,380
That’s the most important thing to look after your yoga by which you do not falter

793
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:16,720
into the ditch of this greed and lust and all those things that are surrounding us.

794
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:24,900
Try to lead a life which is detached. Detachment one has to develop. Detachment.

795
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:31,240
Complete detachment is needed. Today I had a mind of bringing some present for you,

796
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:36,040
because, you see, I love it, I love to give you presents. I don’t know why? That’s an attachment I have.

797
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:48,020
But I said this today I’ll just have little more detachment about it, because if I give it to few then they will be angry.

798
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:53,580
But I had a mind to give you some presents specially, but I’ll give you some special

799
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:05,480
wishes today that – let your willpower become enlightened,

800
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:16,460
let you become the people with great enlightened faith

801
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:29,800
and with enlightened strength. You shed off all these things of the past,

802
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:42,880
come out of your shells, come out of your past conditionings

803
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:51,200
and without jumping towards your ego cleanse yourself completely. Spread your wings

804
01:08:51,200 --> 01:09:02,240
and like a dignified bird you enjoy the ocean of God’s bliss.”

805
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,760
This is what I bless you.

806
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:17,980
The sky, the sky is the limit. There is no limit to your enjoyment,

807
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:24,920
but drop out all these nonsensical things. Just drop out. You are saints, you are yogis, all of you are.

808
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:31,720
You are not ordinary mundane people on the street. Everybody’s feet are to be worshipped, you are of that level.

809
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:35,180
Your Mother has made you like that after Ganesha.

810
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:40,300
And what are you doing? Where are you lost?

811
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,300
Take the responsibility.

812
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,300
May God bless you all!
