1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:02,399
“Where is our attention?” we should say.

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,390
You are meditating, take it deep down into 
yourself.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,950
That’s a meditative mood.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,260
Keep yourself there.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,820
And after meditation you just get up silently, 
sit for a while.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,590
I think best thing will be to have your food 
first and then meditate,

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,800
if that is so, if you think that is proper.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:34,810
But I think if you have to get now into that 
new triggering, as I told you,

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:40,790
into that new jumping that we have to do in 
Sahaja Yoga: if you have to catch that train,

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,579
then you hurry up.

11
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:45,870
You have to change all these ideas.

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,070
You have had many houses,

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,000
you have had many wives and many children 
in your previous life.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,930
You never had your realisation – now you 
have got it.

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,219
So now just every individual, every one of 
you should not think of others,

16
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:07,040
Think of yourself, “I have to do it, I have 
to get it, I have to work it out.”

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,249
This is what you have to do.

18
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:11,039
“Why should I miss it?”

19
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:16,590
This is a chance of many lives, the chance 
of many lives.

20
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,049
And that’s how you can jump over, and work 
it out.

21
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:27,820
We had lots of people in Australia,

22
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,360
and if they had worried about themselves as 
to “what I have done for Sahaja Yoga.”

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,069
So in the morning you just decide,

24
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:36,649
what I am going to do for Sahaja Yog and myself;

25
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:41,590
in the evening, what have I done for myself, 
and what have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

26
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,550
“Myself” doesn’t mean selfishness, but 
“for my ascent.”

27
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,999
Every day.

28
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:49,509
You start a diary to write it down.

29
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,820
You face yourself.

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,619
No excuses, nothing.

31
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,980
If you are left behind, what we can do?

32
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,200
We can’t help it.

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,080
And that is how you’ll find all kinds of 
blessings will come to you.

34
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,790
You’ll be able to save money, you’ll be 
able to save time, you’ll get good jobs.

35
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,000
All your problems can be solved

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,540
if you really surrender yourself to that Paramachaitanya.

37
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,500
Everything can be done.

38
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,650
But as long as you have this narrow-mindedness

39
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,970
and these narrow ideas about yourself, till 
then it won’t work out.

40
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,130
This drop has to become one with the ocean, 
then ocean takes over.
