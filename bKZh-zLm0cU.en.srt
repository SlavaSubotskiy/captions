00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,048
First Public Program in Turkey (Istanbul)
 Emirgan Korusu, 25.06.1989

2
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:11,406
I bow to all the seekers of truth

3
00:00:16,063 --> 00:00:18,420
Can somebody translate me?

4
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:24,402
Gregoire: I can see, they are already in meditation

5
00:00:54,977 --> 00:01:00,767
I said, I bow to all the seekers of truth.

6
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:18,132
Now, we have to realised

7
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,989
 that truth can not be conceptualized.

8
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:32,726
Truth is and will feel all the time.

9
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,799
We can not organize it.

10
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:47,727
And those who are seeking truth,

11
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:51,476
after know that they should keep their minds open.

12
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:53,877
 Like a scientist.

13
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:02,911
And whatever we are telling you,

14
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:06,063
has to be taken as a hypothesis.

15
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:18,251
And if it proofs, right, than you have to
 accept it as honest people.

16
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:31,485
Since long there has been talked about truth.

17
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:40,925
Socrates  talked about it
and he was killed.

18
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:51,954
Then came Christ he talked about it
 he was killed.

19
00:02:55,977 --> 00:03:03,011
Then came prophet Mohammed Sahap
and he was also in a way killed.

20
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:13,647
But today the human awareness is much better.

21
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:24,636
And we are understanding that truth has to be

22
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:28,446
beyond our mental projections.

23
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:44,767
When we see those people who talk of peace

24
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:48,981
and talk of any theories of democracy

25
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:51,923
or capitalism or communism

26
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:06,302
or they talk of any religion like Islam,
 Hinduism, Christianity.

27
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:15,092
Everyone is the just the same.

28
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:22,606
There is no binding force,
 anybody can commit any sin.

29
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:30,556
So where are we got wrong.

30
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:39,778
All these prophets and saints
and incarnations were

31
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:45,723
 absolutely truthful
but where have we gone wrong.

32
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:57,133
 There is one thing common among all of them

33
00:04:57,157 --> 00:05:02,434
that they said, you must see the eternal.

34
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:14,636
And considering things are
 to be used in their moderation

35
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:17,392
and in their limitations.

36
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:28,610
This is the essence of all the religions.

37
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:38,666
But we have gone wrong
because we did not see later.

38
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:48,699
And got lost into transitory things.

39
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:55,677
There was nothing wrong with those

40
00:05:55,701 --> 00:06:01,356
who started on these great religions
and great philosophy.

41
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,853
But we missed the point.

42
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:20,001
But today the human awareness has reached

43
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:23,660
 the state where it can see so clearly.

44
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:37,630
That the fulfillment of the promises
 given to us has to be done.

45
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:49,610
It is said that there is the ruh,
the all-pervading power round us.

46
00:06:57,338 --> 00:07:00,441
All the living things
that you see like flowers,

47
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:06,089
fruits and trees and
human beings are miracles.

48
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:16,863
These are worked out.
These are worked out through

49
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:20,504
this all-pervading subtle power.

50
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:35,426
But so far we have never felt it
enmass, this power.

51
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:45,745
Few saints have faith it
but nobody would believe that.

52
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,881
But now a special blossom time has come.

53
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:01,350
And in this blossom time

54
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:05,611
we are going to find out the truth
without any difficulties.

55
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:14,947
It has should be the easiest thing

56
00:08:14,963 --> 00:08:17,711
because it is a living process.

57
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:29,661
But you saw the seed in the mother earth
it sprouts spontaneously.

58
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:44,537
In the same way within us,  this power

59
00:08:44,562 --> 00:08:49,535
which I have told you, is described
as al-Asas, (The Foundation) in Koran.

60
00:08:57,876 --> 00:09:02,296
In the Bible as the holy ghost.

61
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:12,797
And in the inner scriptures as Adi Shakti,

62
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:17,201
Primordial Mother as Athina.

63
00:09:27,386 --> 00:09:34,939
 Resides in triangular bone called as sacrum,
 meaning sacred bone.

64
00:09:42,051 --> 00:09:45,966
This is the power of God’s desire

65
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:51,939
which resides within us
 as our pure desire.

66
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:09,774
And it spontaneously rises and break
through our fontanel bone area.

67
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:30,098
So actually, you get the actualization
 of your baptism, actualization.

68
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,419
It is not just artificial certificate.

69
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:54,827
Once you become connected with
the all-pervading power

70
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:56,922
and you become a saint

71
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:07,643
or you become wali (a Muslim saint)

72
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:12,599
or you become a self realized soul.

73
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:18,755
As a result of that,

74
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,261
 transformation starts taking place
 in every human being.

75
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:32,669
And this transformation is very unique.

76
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:41,385
Such a person automatically becomes purified.

77
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:51,508
You don’t have to tell such a person, don’t do, don’t do.

78
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:54,430
He just does not do wrong things.

79
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:05,840
He becomes very dynamic
but very compassionate.

80
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:18,010
And lives in complete joy and peace.

81
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:29,539
All this is your right, as human beings to have it.

82
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:39,540
This is the glory, that is within us.

83
00:12:47,128 --> 00:12:52,385
Only, our instrument has to be connected to the main.

84
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:05,765
Also, physical, mental, emotional disorders

85
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,601
 get completely corrected by this power.

86
00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:25,562
 And you start feeling this
 formless energy all round yourself.

87
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:39,684
So, you get your enlightenment
your attention becomes enlightened.

88
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:53,578
Now we have here people from,
 I don’t know how many countries

89
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:59,281
who have come to Istanbul to meet you all.

90
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:14,296
It is surprising how it was difficult for

91
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:20,083
anyone of this western country people,
 specially English, French

92
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:23,859
who even pronounce one Indian Hindi word

93
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:28,404
or any other language in Indian language.

94
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:43,026
But now, these we are pronounce sanskrit.

95
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:48,348
And later all they will be singing Arabic.

96
00:14:50,852 --> 00:14:54,264
Because now they have become universal being.

97
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:02,162
And this is what we have to touch
this our universal being which is the spirit.

98
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:14,857
Now we have people, we have Jews
who worshiped Muhammad Sahap,

99
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,598
who worshiped Christ.

100
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:37,419
Because through their experience of truth,
they have realized that they were incarnations.

101
00:15:42,963 --> 00:15:46,431
All these great incarnations and prophets

102
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:51,187
came on the same tree of life, at different times

103
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:03,115
to give us balance and to save us from evil.

104
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:14,205
But we have plucked the flowers and
 we are saying this is mine this is mine

105
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:17,591
and fighting with these dead flowers.

106
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,994
 So it is important for all people who are honest

107
00:16:30,018 --> 00:16:33,484
and who are seeking the truth,

108
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,785
should achieve their self-realization and see

109
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:41,992
the absolute truth about them.

110
00:16:51,047 --> 00:16:55,614
They never talked ill about each other

111
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:03,164
 but only we, in our ignorance do that.

112
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:12,136
So, this light has to come within us.

113
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:18,493
Supposing we are holding a snake in our hand

114
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:23,473
and there is darkness and your eyes are not open.

115
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:27,993
You will not believe, if somebody says
there is a snake in your hand.

116
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:45,242
But if you get the light and your eyes are open up,

117
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:50,239
you will immediately yourself believe that snake.

118
00:17:58,507 --> 00:18:02,334
So, a person become so powerful and so free

119
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:09,505
that no bad habits can dominate him.

120
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:30,099
You yourself, become your own master
 and manage yourself.

121
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:39,323
I do not have to tell you, don’t do this and don’t do that.

122
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:46,012
I am sorry for today’s delay but

123
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:52,269
 you know, there were problems
of traffic and all kinds of things.

124
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:02,802
It was very unexpected.

125
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:10,583
So, I hope, you will excuse me for coming late.

126
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:19,708
Tomorrow of course, I will be here much earlier

127
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:24,393
and explain to you much more about Sahaja Yoga.

128
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:35,467
Sahaja; Saha means with, ja means born.

129
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:48,475
Yoga means union with the Divine with the Ruh (spirit).

130
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:58,383
So, all the human beings

131
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,983
 whatever race they will belong to

132
00:20:01,008 --> 00:20:04,438
 have a right to achieve this stage.

133
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,411
May God bless you all.

134
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:19,771
If you want to ask me some questions,

135
00:20:19,796 --> 00:20:23,228
 I will be very happy to answer them.

136
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,107
Audience: I would like to ask a question.

137
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:48,085
She just expressed that throughout history,
 important personalities

138
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:51,918
 have been murdered because of
what they had said.

139
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:13,300
Audience: Why did they get murdered?

140
00:21:13,325 --> 00:21:14,491
Audience:She gave an example.

141
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:17,700
She said that Socrates was murdered
 becasue of his words.

142
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:20,875
She said that Hazrat Isa Aleyhissellam
 had been murdered;

143
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,611
although I do not agree with this,

144
00:21:23,636 --> 00:21:26,699
I wonder for which of his words was

145
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:30,937
 Hazrat Mohammad Aleyhisselam was murdered.

146
00:21:52,741 --> 00:21:56,416
Shri Mataji: No. He was supposed to be killed in the sense that

147
00:21:56,441 --> 00:22:00,452
you see, whatever he try to preach and

148
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:05,163
try to do, people would not listen to him

149
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:10,608
and he had to really struggle a lot all his life.

150
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:30,318
Audience: So there is no real act of murder,

151
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:42,244
Shri Mataji: No. Not that way.
That part is not important.

152
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:48,010
 What important part is that
what he wanted to established?

153
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:52,038
In his lifetime, it was very difficult.

154
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:55,866
Because the people were so ignorant.

155
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,561
Audience: Thank you.

156
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:22,950
Audience:  Does the human brain work more
 in Yoga or in sleep,

157
00:23:22,992 --> 00:23:25,802
is there any difference between these two [unclear]

158
00:23:39,588 --> 00:23:41,091
Shri Mataji: What happens?

159
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:51,717
Somebody: The energy wakes up during
the sleep or during a yoga section?

160
00:23:52,323 --> 00:23:54,991
Shri Mataji: No during, not during the sleep

161
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:57,430
but during the yoga section.

162
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,675
It is what should understand
why these great prophets came.

163
00:24:05,687 --> 00:24:08,218
Because they had to help us.

164
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:11,571
In the same way,
 the one who is enlighten,

165
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:14,073
can only enlighten another person.

166
00:24:14,394 --> 00:24:19,492
Like one light, which is enlighten,
 can enlighten.

167
00:24:34,257 --> 00:24:37,884
But that person has to be enlightened,

168
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,960
 is the authority that is from God.

169
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:43,988
That he should be enlightened blinds.

170
00:24:44,013 --> 00:24:47,275
Blind people cannot give light.

171
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:06,438
Audience: Had Buddha found his true
self and become a mystic?

172
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:08,622
Does she agree with that?

173
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:17,053
Audience:  Yes, had he found his true self
and achieved the true state of mysticism?

174
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,050
Shri Mataji: Yes, he did. One,

175
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:32,385
exceptional case, he proofed the Ruh.

176
00:25:38,832 --> 00:25:43,389
 Actually, it was the grace of God
 which worked on him

177
00:25:43,414 --> 00:25:48,573
and he was so, so desperate.

178
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:56,062
And he had reached the state where
 he would have committed suicide if he hadn’t.

179
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,736
And when you are enlighten,
you can enlighten others.

180
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,960
You all have all the powers to you enlighten others.

181
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:15,344
Like I really don’t do it much.

182
00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:20,936
All of them here who are sitting are,
 all I would say, can do it.

183
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:45,063
If that is your capacity that is
your power today. Why not have it.

184
00:26:52,856 --> 00:26:54,900
For, you cannot pay for it.

185
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:59,577
You cannot do anything about it.
 Effortlessly you get it. Why not have it.

186
00:27:10,613 --> 00:27:15,518
It is so simple as that.
Today we went in the Bazaar.

187
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:22,382
And there was a Armenian boy
who was selling us something.

188
00:27:22,618 --> 00:27:25,490
Then he said who are you?

189
00:27:25,816 --> 00:27:29,755
I said, I have come here to give self-realization.

190
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,841
He said can you give me now?
 I said yes.

191
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:38,192
 He just puts his hands towards me
and said,  “ooh I am feeling the cool breeze.”

192
00:28:20,087 --> 00:28:21,884
So he wanted to thank me.

193
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,425
I said, this is your own what I have done.

194
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:26,522
Why did thanking me?

195
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:38,543
This all built-in in you it has got.

196
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,735
Alright, tomorrow you will do
 this to the others.

197
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:56,689
Audience: Is Yoga only good for
bringing peace in this world?

198
00:28:56,714 --> 00:29:00,104
What are her thoughts about the hereafter?

199
00:29:32,095 --> 00:29:35,689
Shri Mataji: See, I have decided
not to talk about myself.

200
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:41,546
The reason is, see now,
because all of them talked

201
00:29:41,564 --> 00:29:45,406
and said often, like Christ,

202
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:48,599
he said, “I am the son of God”

203
00:29:49,064 --> 00:29:54,646
and everything he talked is of truth,
so what did they do to them.

204
00:30:11,168 --> 00:30:13,764
But I must be something no doubt.

205
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:15,748
I must be knowing something.

206
00:30:15,757 --> 00:30:20,068
But is better, you know yourself,
 then you know me better.

207
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:37,320
Audience: Can anyone achieve this task?

208
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:50,635
Shri Mataji: Yes of course.

209
00:30:51,302 --> 00:30:54,280
Anyone who has got enlightenment.

210
00:30:59,592 --> 00:31:01,965
Audience: Just a moment,
 I would like to say a couple of things.

211
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,017
From all your speech
and the questions of the participants,

212
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:09,725
I gather that, this meeting gives the sense that,

213
00:31:09,775 --> 00:31:13,533
it excludes other religions,
 I think that,

214
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:16,489
this is how it’s being narrated right now.

215
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:21,476
I kindly request Her to explain
 if this is the case.

216
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:51,612
Shri Mataji: Of course. It proves.

217
00:31:51,637 --> 00:31:55,090
It proves that  truth, of course.

218
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,244
Of course. Of course.

219
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:10,812
All religions are true.
No doubt about it

220
00:32:10,822 --> 00:32:14,075
but we have done mistakes.
That is the point I am saying.

221
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:26,512
Audience: This is what I wanted to explain;

222
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,378
that all religions are true,

223
00:32:28,394 --> 00:32:30,762
that all of them express the reality

224
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:34,607
but that we make errors while trying
 to understand the religions.

225
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:39,215
So, with your explanation right now,
I should presume that you are trying to fix this;

226
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,411
based on your explanation.
Is this own I should presume?

227
00:32:43,436 --> 00:32:52,350
So all of these other religions are in a chaos, [UNCLEAR]

228
00:32:52,375 --> 00:33:01,700
but because of this now
we […] they find explanations like yoga.

229
00:33:11,877 --> 00:33:14,900
Audience: Can she tell a bit about the tree of life?

230
00:33:24,547 --> 00:33:26,707
Shri Mataji: I mean tomorrow definitely.

231
00:33:26,732 --> 00:33:29,051
I will explain to each and everything.

232
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:33,571
There is going to be no secret
about this knowledge of the roots.

233
00:33:33,598 --> 00:33:36,200
This is the knowledge of the roots.

234
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:40,650
Only we have to become subtle, to feel it.

235
00:33:43,553 --> 00:33:46,180
Everything, everything.

236
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:54,616
But this knowledge is love, is compassion.

237
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:06,456
Audience:  What is the thing about Sahaja Yoga

238
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:08,323
that distinguishes it from
the other methods.

239
00:34:08,348 --> 00:34:12,081
I would like her to give an explanation.
 If you wish […]

240
00:34:21,775 --> 00:34:24,108
Shri Mataji: other yogas?

241
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:27,964
Shri Mataji: See. That way, all other yogas

242
00:34:27,988 --> 00:34:32,757
 are actually an integral part of Sahaja Yoga.

243
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:45,392
If you do say Hatha Yoga,
in that also, it is first of all, the cleansing

244
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,816
this that and all that and then
 you reach a point

245
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,937
 where you have to take realization.

246
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:04,134
Allright. Now, the second is
you can say, Raja Yoga and all that

247
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:07,558
the way they preach is artificial.

248
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:25,236
Like in Raja Yoga,

249
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:32,108
they say that, you should take
 your tongue backwards

250
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:36,573
and you should put your stomach
 tight and all those things.

251
00:35:36,598 --> 00:35:40,401
But when kundalini rises,
 automatically it happens.

252
00:35:40,434 --> 00:35:42,481
You don’t have to do it.

253
00:36:01,174 --> 00:36:03,443
Like when your car starts,

254
00:36:03,468 --> 00:36:06,906
all the machinery starts moving automatically.

255
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,085
But supposing, you just take
 the wheel and start moving,

256
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,911
the car won’t move.

257
00:36:28,527 --> 00:36:36,255
So, one has to understand that
yoga means; union with the divine.

258
00:36:41,923 --> 00:36:45,708
Now, the difference is that in modern times ,

259
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:48,151
 nobody has time to go to Himalaya

260
00:36:48,176 --> 00:36:51,698
and sit there for hours together, cleansing themselves.

261
00:37:01,356 --> 00:37:04,181
So, I have found a method.

262
00:37:04,213 --> 00:37:07,485
By which first of all raise your kundalini.

263
00:37:18,795 --> 00:37:20,883
And most of you, I am surprised,

264
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:23,821
you get your realization for fix that moment.

265
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:37,701
But supposing, somebody do not get it fixed.

266
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:40,870
Then they can see in that little light,
what is wrong with them

267
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:44,985
and they improve themselves.
I don’t have to tell them.

268
00:37:56,493 --> 00:37:58,913
So you become your own master.

269
00:38:04,058 --> 00:38:07,012
Audience:  In the transcendental meditation technique,

270
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:09,267
when people access a certain consciousness,

271
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:12,579
they rise a couple of centimeters from the ground.

272
00:38:23,164 --> 00:38:25,468
Shri Mataji: No. It is all, it is not true.

273
00:38:25,484 --> 00:38:27,015
 It is falsehood.

274
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:33,522
You see, first, you must know that
anybody who takes money from you

275
00:38:33,547 --> 00:38:37,375
in the name of religion,
 in the name of yoga, in anything,

276
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,742
is a false guru.

277
00:38:52,655 --> 00:38:55,140
I don’t mind, even they being cheats,

278
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:59,127
but not only they cheat you,
 not only they cheat you,

279
00:38:59,152 --> 00:39:01,337
but they spoil your kundalini

280
00:39:01,362 --> 00:39:04,634
and they spoil your chances of realization.

281
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:09,272
We had about only 4 or 5 people only yesterday,

282
00:39:09,285 --> 00:39:11,896
who came to us from this TM.

283
00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:15,485
Who poor things have become recluses.

284
00:39:28,964 --> 00:39:30,217
Also logically,

285
00:39:31,515 --> 00:39:33,644
logically we should understand

286
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,652
what is there to get up from the body

287
00:39:36,676 --> 00:39:39,766
and to move about. What is the sense?

288
00:39:48,406 --> 00:39:49,708
What is the advantage?

289
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:52,763
We have to two legs to walk.
 What is the need?

290
00:39:53,242 --> 00:39:54,479
It is stupid.

291
00:40:00,021 --> 00:40:03,746
All this kind of funny things,

292
00:40:03,771 --> 00:40:07,065
if they tell you,
why should you believe them?

293
00:40:13,756 --> 00:40:16,853
No scripture has talked about it.

294
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:22,957
There should be some bases.

295
00:40:28,266 --> 00:40:31,877
Audience:  I am sorry,
 here is our friend’s question:

296
00:40:31,902 --> 00:40:35,073
there is this one yoga in India,
Marashi Marashi,

297
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:37,098
their students are doing this thing

298
00:40:37,123 --> 00:40:40,505
but this esteemed lady is saying
 that it’s fake.

299
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:56,066
Shri Mataji: (UNCLEAR) I have nothing to do with him.

300
00:40:58,382 --> 00:41:00,645
Go and see his bank balance. That is all.

301
00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:11,823
Please be careful.

302
00:41:11,866 --> 00:41:15,724
Please be careful. I am sorry.
They are Indians, I know.

303
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:19,162
I know, they are Indians.
I am very sorry for that.

304
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:22,174
That is why, I am here to tell you the truth.

305
00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:37,335
I have to I would like to warn also.

306
00:41:43,287 --> 00:41:48,290
 I have talked about them in 1970,
very openly.

307
00:41:55,016 --> 00:41:57,055
 Very openly.

308
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:02,408
But still people, I don’t know how
they take to him. Because

309
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:06,897
he says that he can make people pay,

310
00:42:06,922 --> 00:42:09,772
so people are happy,
I think to pay.

311
00:42:19,692 --> 00:42:22,588
Thousands of seekers are ruined.

312
00:42:35,312 --> 00:42:37,225
Audience: In short, does she mean fake?

313
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,185
Shri Mataji:  Now one more question and no more. Allright?

314
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:44,406
Because it is getting late now.

315
00:42:45,169 --> 00:42:48,537
Audience: I am one of the people who use this technique,

316
00:42:48,562 --> 00:42:52,777
they took the money but I am very
satisfied with this technique.

317
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,028
Until now I had a very stressful life.

318
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,395
It had an extremely positive impact.

319
00:43:19,586 --> 00:43:21,118
Audience:  There was a mistranslation.

320
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:22,976
Audience:  I use TM

321
00:43:23,023 --> 00:43:26,888
Interpreter: Aa, I am sorry.
I made a mistake. I am sorry.

322
00:43:30,565 --> 00:43:32,533
Shri Mataji: I am surprise.

323
00:43:32,549 --> 00:43:36,596
Interpreter:  The lady meant transcendental meditation.

324
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:37,700
Shri Mataji: Of course, I know.

325
00:43:37,774 --> 00:43:41,171
Interpreter:   But she claims that she is quite happy.

326
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:45,491
 I mean, she has been able to redeem
all the stress she had.

327
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,036
Shri Mataji: Alright. Then it is alright.

328
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:50,548
If she thinks so, but I can tell you this much,
 that please don’t come back to me

329
00:43:50,573 --> 00:43:52,937
when you will have problem.

330
00:43:58,694 --> 00:44:01,727
Moreover, you see.
What power she has?

331
00:44:01,744 --> 00:44:03,594
What has she learned?

332
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:05,985
Can she give realization to anyone?

333
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:06,875
It is the point.

334
00:44:06,882 --> 00:44:09,748
What is the great transformations she has got ?

335
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:27,154
You see, the mantras,
this gentleman is giving,

336
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:29,448
because you don’t know sanskrit.

337
00:44:29,731 --> 00:44:32,254
 (UNCLEAR) one is tinga,

338
00:44:32,279 --> 00:44:34,987
pinga, inga. These are not sanskrit.

339
00:44:35,013 --> 00:44:36,965
He doesn’t know sanskrit, this man.

340
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:48,963
Tinga means, tinga means when
you show somebody like this.

341
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,933
What do you say it in your language?

342
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:51,958
Thump

343
00:44:52,013 --> 00:44:53,427
That is tinga.

344
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:54,881
That is the mantra, he gives

345
00:44:54,921 --> 00:44:59,431
and 300 pound he charges
for giving such a stupid mantras.

346
00:45:07,015 --> 00:45:12,993
And another one he gives is inga,
 meaning sting of the scorpion.

347
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:24,261
And pinga means when you get possessed,

348
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:27,335
you go round and round like that.
You see that is pinga.

349
00:45:36,229 --> 00:45:39,903
I am sorry. I,
 I am not with that, at all.

350
00:45:44,095 --> 00:45:45,499
Audience: I hadn’t asked my question.

351
00:45:47,255 --> 00:45:49,160
I just shared my own experience.

352
00:45:49,185 --> 00:45:51,266
What I am trying to ask is this:

353
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:53,546
the technique that they teach in the society

354
00:45:53,571 --> 00:45:56,208
is the special meditation technique of a caste

355
00:45:56,233 --> 00:45:59,537
that’s founded on veda science
 that has been applied since 2000 BC.

356
00:45:59,562 --> 00:46:05,050
When you apply this technique in return
 for money, is this a right or wrong thing?

357
00:46:37,834 --> 00:46:40,659
Shri Mataji:I can give you a complete story about,

358
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,438
if you come and see me.

359
00:46:42,463 --> 00:46:46,265
That they started  of course in which people were

360
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:49,827
stool to be jumping.I have got a

361
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:54,290
whole coming sorf of a letter from that gentleman

362
00:46:54,305 --> 00:46:56,211
whom I have cured also.

363
00:46:56,323 --> 00:47:00,467
And they started course in Scotland.

364
00:47:00,492 --> 00:47:04,439
His name was Mr Pitapirs and his wife.

365
00:47:04,467 --> 00:47:06,659
She was the granddaughter of a duke.

366
00:47:06,675 --> 00:47:11,066
And they became bankrupt
and epileptic, 3 of them.

367
00:47:11,091 --> 00:47:14,879
And I have to keep them in
my own house, to treat them.

368
00:47:14,914 --> 00:47:16,709
And I have got a letter from them.

369
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:19,282
So I mean this is what I am saying that,

370
00:47:19,305 --> 00:47:22,252
they go to any guru, let them go.
But then don’t come back to me.

371
00:47:22,277 --> 00:47:23,865
Because I headache for them.

372
00:48:01,867 --> 00:48:05,281
I will send you his letter.
You can see it.

373
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:10,461
 Now poor man, he became bankrupt
and he has gone to South Africa.

374
00:48:22,112 --> 00:48:24,622
And he is told me that he used to tell that,

375
00:48:24,638 --> 00:48:28,448
he could pass through the wall he could jump up

376
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:31,650
in the air, then all lies.

377
00:48:31,674 --> 00:48:34,502
Because he puts so much money in it.

378
00:48:47,449 --> 00:48:49,433
Audience: Also in the society, I am saying this in parentheses,
they don’t tell us that there is such a thing.

379
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:51,090
they don’t tell us that there is such a thing.

380
00:48:51,115 --> 00:48:53,921
Shri Mataji: Alright now we don’t want to anymore of this TM.

381
00:48:56,073 --> 00:49:00,091
 Now let it be now.
Let us have the realization part.

382
00:49:00,576 --> 00:49:01,417
Better.

383
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:02,877
Audience: Excuse me can I have your attention?

384
00:49:02,909 --> 00:49:07,247
How are we going to learn this 
system of yoga and how we can apply this?

385
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:09,002
Interpreter:  We will show tomorrow.

386
00:49:09,027 --> 00:49:11,010
Interpreter: Tomorrow,

387
00:49:11,636 --> 00:49:12,414
Let us have this please.

388
00:49:12,439 --> 00:49:13,958
Interpreter: It got late now.

389
00:49:15,264 --> 00:49:18,124
Audience:We can’t do tomorrow, it will be too crowded.

390
00:49:19,283 --> 00:49:23,522
Interpreter:  He has worried that 
tomorrow session will be too crowded

391
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:26,731
and they may not be able to get  realisation.

392
00:49:26,753 --> 00:49:28,382
Shri Mataji: get realization. 
So let us have the realization

393
00:49:28,406 --> 00:49:31,350
that what I am saying, 
you are reel seekers.

394
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:46,895
Very simple it is. Very simple.

395
00:49:47,086 --> 00:49:49,498
Alright. Now, just think that

396
00:49:49,525 --> 00:49:52,099
we have to use the power of the mother earth

397
00:49:52,124 --> 00:49:55,728
so we have to take out our shoes. That is all.

398
00:49:56,386 --> 00:49:57,792
Take out our shoes.

399
00:50:04,022 --> 00:50:07,009
As we take out for any ibadet in centers.

400
00:50:17,295 --> 00:50:19,527
And have we put our hands for namaz.

401
00:50:19,551 --> 00:50:22,783
Namaz, the thing, Mohammed sahib told you,

402
00:50:22,808 --> 00:50:25,595
it was all kundalini awakening. It was all.

403
00:50:37,603 --> 00:50:39,824
Just, everything.

404
00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:42,194
Now.

405
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,923
Now before you close your eyes,

406
00:50:49,939 --> 00:50:52,766
I will tell you, how to help your centers

407
00:50:52,791 --> 00:50:55,784
which are on left hand side. We will work out.

408
00:51:02,296 --> 00:51:04,343
Very simple it is.

409
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:10,063
First, you have put your left hand towards me

410
00:51:10,072 --> 00:51:13,701
which is symbolically. 
This is the power of desire.

411
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:16,346
So you want to have your realization.

412
00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:25,501
 Now so, left hand towards me like this,

413
00:51:25,518 --> 00:51:28,932
simple and the right hand on your heart.

414
00:51:28,966 --> 00:51:32,275
Because in the heart resides your spirit.

415
00:51:35,094 --> 00:51:38,340
 Left towards me, left, left, left hand towards me.

416
00:51:38,365 --> 00:51:42,018
 Right, right hand on the heart.

417
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:46,182
Right, right.
Alright,

418
00:51:46,412 --> 00:51:51,601
Now, then this is the center where the spirit resides.

419
00:51:56,904 --> 00:52:02,657
Now you have to put your hand in the upper part of
your abdomen on the left hand side.

420
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:12,195
And then you have to put your right hand

421
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:16,546
in the lower part of your abdomen
on the left hand side, again.

422
00:52:22,422 --> 00:52:29,799
Now the upper part of your abdomen
is the center of your mastery.

423
00:52:30,506 --> 00:52:32,596
Of your mastery.

424
00:52:50,356 --> 00:52:54,371
Now, in the lower part of your abdomen, on the left hand side,

425
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:59,057
is the center of pure knowledge which

426
00:52:59,434 --> 00:53:03,008
manifests through your central nervous system.

427
00:53:14,915 --> 00:53:17,811
Now,  you put your hand again

428
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:20,877
on the upper portion of your abdomen
on the left hand side

429
00:53:20,893 --> 00:53:23,639
which is the center of our mastery.

430
00:53:32,222 --> 00:53:35,650
Now, you put your right hand, again on the heart

431
00:53:35,664 --> 00:53:37,700
 which is the spirit.

432
00:53:43,868 --> 00:53:48,114
Now, the center between the neck

433
00:53:48,139 --> 00:53:51,453
and your shoulder, in the corner,

434
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:55,574
you put your hand and turn your head to your right.

435
00:54:02,862 --> 00:54:07,392
Now, this is the center, we catch,
when we feel guilty.

436
00:54:12,257 --> 00:54:15,201
You should be very pleasantly place toward yourself,

437
00:54:15,226 --> 00:54:20,386
after all you are a human being and if you commit mistakes,

438
00:54:20,421 --> 00:54:23,549
after all you are not God.

439
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:43,943
Now, you put your hand on your forehead
 across, and press it hard.

440
00:54:48,453 --> 00:54:52,627
This is the center of forgiveness.

441
00:54:58,043 --> 00:55:02,384
Now you put your right hand on the backside of your head

442
00:55:02,409 --> 00:55:04,759
and push behind your head.

443
00:55:10,867 --> 00:55:17,218
This is the center of asking for
forgiveness without feeling guilty.

444
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:26,896
Now stretch your hand

445
00:55:28,229 --> 00:55:32,971
and put the center of your hand on top of your head,

446
00:55:33,585 --> 00:55:38,231
bend your head,
push back your fingers

447
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:43,698
and move your scalp slowly, seven times.

448
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:50,934
Because there are seven seats of
the seven centers in your brain.

449
00:55:58,138 --> 00:56:00,090
Stretch back your fingers.

450
00:56:10,049 --> 00:56:14,040
Now just we have to do it by closing our eyes.

451
00:56:14,065 --> 00:56:17,581
You can take out your spectacles.
You have to sit properly.

452
00:56:27,173 --> 00:56:30,426
Keep the legs apart from each other.

453
00:56:30,492 --> 00:56:35,264
Not to sit in a way that you are slouching

454
00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:39,988
or too much strain but in a natural, normal, straight.

455
00:56:50,554 --> 00:56:54,474
Now please close your eyes and don’t open them, till I tell you.

456
00:57:00,446 --> 00:57:03,358
Now, please put the left hand towards me.

457
00:57:07,421 --> 00:57:10,442
 And right hand, on the heart.

458
00:57:13,717 --> 00:57:15,146
 Please close your eyes.

459
00:57:17,585 --> 00:57:22,486
 Here, you have to say

460
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:27,047
and ask a question to me 3 times.

461
00:57:27,154 --> 00:57:29,408
 It is a very important question.

462
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:32,823
Mother, am I the spirit?

463
00:57:43,339 --> 00:57:44,592
 3 times.

464
00:58:02,016 --> 00:58:04,915
 If you are the spirit,
 you are your guide,

465
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,177
you are your master.

466
00:58:07,399 --> 00:58:09,499
So please put this right hand

467
00:58:09,515 --> 00:58:12,462
in the upper portion of your abdomen

468
00:58:12,487 --> 00:58:15,606
and press it hard the left hand side

469
00:58:15,649 --> 00:58:17,839
and ask me a question.

470
00:58:29,055 --> 00:58:31,809
 Here you ask me a question again 3 times.

471
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:37,194
Mother, am I my own master?

472
00:58:37,196 --> 00:58:40,339
Call me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever suites you.

473
00:58:57,649 --> 00:59:01,617
 Now, take down your hand in the 
lower portion of your abdomen

474
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:05,336
and press it hard.

475
00:59:08,827 --> 00:59:15,117
 Here, I have to respect your freedom.

476
00:59:18,251 --> 00:59:21,425
And I can not force pure knowledge on you.

477
00:59:25,067 --> 00:59:28,622
 So, you have to ask me, in your own freedom.

478
00:59:31,248 --> 00:59:33,653
 Please say 6 times.

479
00:59:33,717 --> 00:59:38,879
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

480
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,997
 Now,

481
00:59:53,561 --> 00:59:55,618
when you ask this question,

482
00:59:55,643 --> 01:00:00,034
this force of Kundalini starts rising.

483
01:00:23,334 --> 01:00:25,746
 Now, raise your hand

484
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:32,767
on the upper portion of your abdomen
on the left hand side and press it hard.

485
01:00:38,446 --> 01:00:40,382
 As the kundalini is raising,

486
01:00:40,407 --> 01:00:45,505
we have to help with our confident,
 our centers to open out.

487
01:00:54,055 --> 01:00:57,405
Here you have to say 10 times

488
01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:02,029
Because there are 10 petals to this center.

489
01:01:11,028 --> 01:01:13,837
 With full confidence say,

490
01:01:14,663 --> 01:01:20,127
Mother, I am my own master.
Say it 10 times.

491
01:01:27,903 --> 01:01:31,427
 This center is created by own prophets.

492
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:46,552
Now, one has to know

493
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:49,144
that, we are not this body.

494
01:01:49,162 --> 01:01:52,876
We are not this mind.

495
01:01:53,111 --> 01:01:55,753
We are not ego.

496
01:02:04,394 --> 01:02:06,838
We are not our conditionings

497
01:02:06,862 --> 01:02:10,396
but we are pure spirit.

498
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:21,256
So, now, raise your hand onto your heart.

499
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:29,950
And say with full confidence,

500
01:02:32,527 --> 01:02:35,709
the most important truth about yourself,

501
01:02:40,283 --> 01:02:46,105
Mother, I am the spirit.
 Say this 12 times.

502
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:12,374
Now, raise your right hand,

503
01:03:15,175 --> 01:03:24,408
into the corner of your neck
 and your shoulder.

504
01:03:29,403 --> 01:03:32,426
One has to know

505
01:03:33,095 --> 01:03:37,216
that Divine is the power

506
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:43,516
of bliss and joy.

507
01:03:50,022 --> 01:03:51,022
But above all,

508
01:03:54,932 --> 01:04:00,209
above, above all it is the power of forgiveness.

509
01:04:07,015 --> 01:04:09,959
 So whatever so called mistakes,
 you have committed

510
01:04:09,984 --> 01:04:14,358
then be dissolved completely into that power.

511
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:26,656
 So please turn your face to the right.

512
01:04:28,692 --> 01:04:31,926
Symbolically saying that,

513
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:36,061
 Mother, I am not guilty.
Say it 16 times.

514
01:04:59,184 --> 01:05:03,637
Now, raise your right hand

515
01:05:03,662 --> 01:05:06,883
onto your forehead across and press it hard.

516
01:05:14,281 --> 01:05:16,693
 You may bend your head.

517
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:23,373
 Here is the center to forgive.

518
01:05:26,571 --> 01:05:28,951
You forgive everyone.

519
01:05:32,689 --> 01:05:38,619
So please say with full confidence,

520
01:05:39,043 --> 01:05:42,781
Mother, I forgive everyone.

521
01:05:51,828 --> 01:05:55,589
 Many people say that is difficult to forgive.

522
01:05:55,661 --> 01:06:00,792
But whether you forgive
or you don’t forgive, it is a myth.

523
01:06:09,417 --> 01:06:13,357
But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

524
01:06:18,817 --> 01:06:23,046
 So please say from your heart,

525
01:06:23,071 --> 01:06:25,804
Mother I forgive everyone.

526
01:06:33,237 --> 01:06:38,301
Now, take your right hand

527
01:06:38,326 --> 01:06:40,406
on the backside of your head

528
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:44,152
and allow your head to rest on it.

529
01:06:52,132 --> 01:06:54,727
Here without feeling guilty,

530
01:06:54,752 --> 01:07:00,277
without counting your mistakes for your own satisfaction.

531
01:07:09,262 --> 01:07:11,944
Please say,

532
01:07:13,349 --> 01:07:18,813
O Divine, If I have done
anything wrong, please forgive me.

533
01:07:28,886 --> 01:07:30,242
 From your heart.

534
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:38,918
 Now stretch your palm and

535
01:07:41,129 --> 01:07:45,429
put the center of your palm on top of your head.

536
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:51,389
 On soft bone which was in your childhood.

537
01:07:56,747 --> 01:07:58,722
 Push back your fingers.

538
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:06,729
Now again, I can not force on you,
self realization.

539
01:08:13,727 --> 01:08:17,433
 So now bend your head and say 7 times

540
01:08:17,441 --> 01:08:24,891
moving your hand with pressure
your scalp, clockwise.

541
01:08:35,329 --> 01:08:38,741
 Mother please give me self realization.

542
01:08:44,752 --> 01:08:46,577
Please move 7 times.

543
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:33,303
Now take down your hands.

544
01:09:36,092 --> 01:09:40,881
Put both the hands towards me
 and open our eyes slowly.

545
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:53,920
Now just see, if you are thoughtless,
 you can't see any thought.

546
01:09:58,089 --> 01:10:03,376
Now, bend your head and put your right hand towards me.

547
01:10:08,839 --> 01:10:14,309
 And left hand you try to feel
cool breeze out of your head.

548
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:34,323
Now, put the and again put the head down

549
01:10:34,348 --> 01:10:37,364
and put the left hand towards me.

550
01:10:39,976 --> 01:10:43,476
 And with the right hand see again,
 if there is a cool breeze coming,

551
01:10:43,492 --> 01:10:45,547
could be hot also.

552
01:10:56,311 --> 01:11:01,032
Now, put the right hand again towards me

553
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:05,125
and see with the left hand if there is
a cool breeze coming out of you.

554
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:17,118
Now put your hands up in the sky,

555
01:11:17,143 --> 01:11:22,810
like that towards the sky, push back
 your head and ask a question.

556
01:11:24,299 --> 01:11:29,975
 Is this the all pervading power of God?

557
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,715
 Is this the Ruh?

558
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:47,225
 Is this the power of love

559
01:11:53,578 --> 01:11:55,847
 Now take down your hands

560
01:11:59,734 --> 01:12:01,750
You all will feel very relaxed.

561
01:12:05,637 --> 01:12:08,771
 Now those who are felt the cool breeze of their head

562
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:11,750
and in your hands,

563
01:12:17,052 --> 01:12:20,298
like this, so you can feel in the hand of others also,

564
01:12:21,478 --> 01:12:22,545
neighbor’s head.

565
01:12:26,124 --> 01:12:28,497
 Here also, here.

566
01:12:29,614 --> 01:12:32,113
 All of you felt it I know.

567
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:35,259
 So raise your hand, let’s see, both the hands.

568
01:12:39,196 --> 01:12:42,052
 Those who are felt  is this, raise your hands.

569
01:12:49,944 --> 01:12:51,602
May God Bless you all.

570
01:12:51,636 --> 01:12:54,025
So many of you are felt it.

571
01:12:58,311 --> 01:13:01,001
Tomorrow again you are coming here

572
01:13:01,034 --> 01:13:03,343
And we are going to establish it fully.

573
01:13:07,305 --> 01:13:10,130
 You will feel very joyus, very happy.

574
01:13:15,956 --> 01:13:18,242
Tomorrow (UNCLEAR).

575
01:13:26,666 --> 01:13:29,610
 I hope, you will bring your friends.

576
01:13:33,412 --> 01:13:36,490
 You feel very relax, very happy.

577
01:13:40,476 --> 01:13:42,785
Especially,  I have seen muslims,

578
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:46,518
they receiving very fast.

579
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:56,417
Got it, I know you got it.

580
01:13:58,628 --> 01:14:01,130
 Alright. So, please come tomorrow

581
01:14:01,138 --> 01:14:04,812
and don’t discuss it.
 Because this is beyond your thought.

582
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:08,976
Audience: What time is the meeting tomorrow?

583
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:15,448
Interpreter Half past six.

584
01:14:16,984 --> 01:14:19,662
Shri Mataji:  I will be very early there.

585
01:14:19,687 --> 01:14:21,924
Tomorrow I hope there is no traffic jam.

586
01:14:24,071 --> 01:14:26,991
Somebody: Gentleman wants to ask a question, if you don’t mind

587
01:14:27,016 --> 01:14:30,632
Shri Mataji: Please come. Please come. You can come here.

588
01:14:30,651 --> 01:14:33,454
Audience: I am asking this so that
 everybody can hear.

589
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:36,529
Shri Mataji: Allright, allright.

590
01:14:37,079 --> 01:14:47,240
Audience:  First of all, we are happy
to see her here in Istanbul.

591
01:14:47,265 --> 01:14:49,408
I would like to welcome her.

592
01:14:55,987 --> 01:15:00,244
I need to express that in the previous questions,

593
01:15:00,252 --> 01:15:03,914
some concepts were indeed being misunderstood

594
01:15:03,939 --> 01:15:07,745
and this is because there are a lot of misinformation

595
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:11,328
 and wrong knowledge around these in Turkey.

596
01:15:26,796 --> 01:15:29,065
Shri Mataji: It is allright but one has to answer.

597
01:15:29,082 --> 01:15:30,779
In fact this is the first time we are attending a meeting like this

598
01:15:30,804 --> 01:15:33,490
As Sufis were informed about this but…

599
01:15:38,013 --> 01:15:40,600
Shri Mataji: No, no. It is alright. See I am a mother.

600
01:15:40,616 --> 01:15:42,874
So it is alright. Children must ask questions..

601
01:15:42,906 --> 01:15:47,191
Audience: When we talk about yoga here in Turkey,

602
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:50,286
maybe she knows about it, there is a famous Yogi Kazim.

603
01:15:50,302 --> 01:15:53,472
He pokes his body with skewers in circuses and stuff.

604
01:15:53,488 --> 01:15:55,100
When we say yoga in Turkey,

605
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:58,270
everybody expects something like this
 because there is such an image.

606
01:16:25,007 --> 01:16:26,554
Shri Mataji: No, austerities.

607
01:16:26,586 --> 01:16:30,074
Audience:  For this reason.
When you talk about the yoga technique,

608
01:16:30,099 --> 01:16:34,449
there are established prejudices bring in
such associations of meaning.

609
01:16:34,474 --> 01:16:38,230
We listened her and understood that this is not the case

610
01:16:38,255 --> 01:16:41,418
but this has to be told to everyone in a very explicit way.

611
01:16:41,434 --> 01:16:42,505
This image must be erased.

612
01:16:57,343 --> 01:17:01,565
Audience:   So just like the merchants in
every religion and every system,

613
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:04,317
because they are the merchants if yoga,

614
01:17:04,342 --> 01:17:09,986
I would kindly ask her to be at ease that
she is not being understood in this way.

615
01:17:09,994 --> 01:17:11,766
Thank you.

616
01:17:37,004 --> 01:17:41,614
Shri Mataji: You see, there are no
 austerities in Sahaja Yoga.

617
01:17:41,642 --> 01:17:43,912
 No asceticism in Sahaja Yoga.

618
01:17:50,382 --> 01:17:53,088
 No materyalistic life in Sahaja Yoga.

619
01:17:56,609 --> 01:18:01,269
 God has created this world, for you, to enjoy.

620
01:18:01,293 --> 01:18:03,088
But in the right way.

621
01:18:10,737 --> 01:18:12,967
 He is your father.

622
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:16,165
And the greatest of fathers.

623
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:23,612
 And why he did you guide you to be miserable.

624
01:18:26,714 --> 01:18:31,952
 Actually, he is anxious for you
 to enter into his Kingdom,

625
01:18:31,977 --> 01:18:34,049
enjoy his love and blessing.

626
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:43,308
Thank you very much.

627
01:18:51,773 --> 01:18:55,844
Beautiful. Very beautiful people.

628
01:18:56,005 --> 01:19:01,572
You got alright. Now, laugh, enjoy.

629
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:55,095
 The problem is that, there was no
one here as Sahaja Yogi.

630
01:19:55,409 --> 01:19:58,408
Now luckily we have a lady

631
01:19:58,433 --> 01:20:00,609
whose husband got transport.

632
01:20:00,611 --> 01:20:04,138
 See, I could have come much earlier here.

633
01:20:04,163 --> 01:20:05,934
As I have been another country.

634
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:08,134
I have been working now for 18 years

635
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:10,953
but there was no one in Turkey.

636
01:20:11,734 --> 01:20:17,022
 So I had to wait for somebody to be here already.

637
01:20:28,938 --> 01:20:31,532
 There is a lady who has got transfer here.

638
01:20:36,889 --> 01:20:39,801
Now we have here  the lots of people ...

639
01:20:47,281 --> 01:20:48,297
Thank you.

640
01:20:48,322 --> 01:20:49,701
 Thank you so much.

641
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:51,846
 Thank you my child.

642
01:20:51,871 --> 01:20:54,292
So happy today

643
01:20:55,678 --> 01:20:56,811
May God bless you

644
01:20:59,001 --> 01:21:00,421
May God bless you

645
01:21:01,567 --> 01:21:02,700
May God bless you

646
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:13,631
Look at his eyes. See now his eyes.
 Look at his eyes. See.

647
01:21:24,699 --> 01:21:26,406
 Tomorrow hope to see you.

648
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:29,273
Tomorrow hope to see you madam. Alright

649
01:21:36,427 --> 01:21:39,070
 Thank you. Are you alright.

650
01:21:45,999 --> 01:21:48,109
Hello, did you feel the cool breeze.

651
01:21:53,068 --> 01:21:55,139
Audience: Can you please ask what is the meaning?

652
01:21:55,164 --> 01:21:56,654
I got very curious.

653
01:21:56,679 --> 01:22:00,212
But there has to be a difference. Can you please ask?

654
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:03,842
But there has to be a difference.

655
01:22:05,216 --> 01:22:07,049
Can you please ask?

656
01:22:16,512 --> 01:22:21,045
Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you very much.

657
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:24,415
Interpreter:  The gentleman would like
 to know what exactly is different

658
01:22:24,423 --> 01:22:27,550
that he felt heat instead of cool breeze.

659
01:22:27,592 --> 01:22:29,279
Shri Mataji: Still you are feeling.

660
01:22:29,304 --> 01:22:32,700
Little heat in the body instead always
and now they said you can see here.

661
01:22:32,702 --> 01:22:35,077
If you can see here becoming softer, here.

662
01:22:35,102 --> 01:22:37,928
And through this all the heat is coming out.

663
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:39,365
Let the heat get out.

664
01:22:39,376 --> 01:22:42,528
And heat will get out.
And you will feel cool better.

665
01:22:42,536 --> 01:22:47,239
Because in the body, in the system
they said heat will (UNCLEAR) go which is together.

666
01:22:47,249 --> 01:22:49,305
And (UNCLEAR) due to liver.

667
01:22:55,808 --> 01:22:58,673
And also he has to forgive.

668
01:22:58,689 --> 01:23:01,495
He has to forgive.
I think he didn’t forgive fully.

669
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,631
So please forgive.

670
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:09,096
Please forgive. Forgive, forgive

671
01:23:09,187 --> 01:23:15,021
Please forgive. Forgive, forgive

672
01:23:18,322 --> 01:23:22,910
See now. You not forgive. He did not forgive.

673
01:23:23,185 --> 01:23:25,002
He did not forgive.

674
01:23:25,522 --> 01:23:27,331
Interpreter:  Nice to see you.

675
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:30,117
Shri Mataji: Thank you. Look at your eyes, sparkling.

676
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:38,300
Nice. Are you alright?

677
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:43,672
 Hello now, you, young people
 have to take it up. Alright.

678
01:23:47,036 --> 01:23:48,908
I am sorry this language, I don’t know.

679
01:23:57,082 --> 01:24:01,665
There is young people, I have to know understand and take it out.

680
01:24:18,493 --> 01:24:20,763

01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:23,073
