1
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:12,338
Adi Shakti Puja. Nirmal Nagari, Canajoharie, NY (USA),
2 July 2000.

2
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:05,690
Today we have come here to do the Adi Shakti Puja.

3
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:15,434
I have already told you about the Adi Shakti,  how

4
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:23,606
She had to work out so many things in this world —

5
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:31,033
first to create and then

6
00:05:33,454 --> 00:05:37,393
to create human beings through evolutionary process.

7
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,936
After that, to comfort.

8
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:51,826
Then to counsel.

9
00:05:53,164 --> 00:05:59,643
So many people here came on this Earth just to do the counselling.

10
00:06:01,381 --> 00:06:05,245
They told what was wrong, what was right,

11
00:06:05,773 --> 00:06:09,313
what should we do, what we should not do,

12
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:16,813
what is self-respect and what is the

13
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:26,349
duty of a human being as a superior-most creature.

14
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:29,346
So many of Them came on this Earth.

15
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:34,047
One after another, in every country, They came

16
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,268
and Their counselling formed religions.

17
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:43,914
Of course, you see the mess of the religions

18
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:47,067
and that’s how Their life was wasted,

19
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:53,836
that They formed religions after religions,

20
00:06:56,491 --> 00:07:01,114
by which only human beings were divided,

21
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:08,353
divided to such an extent they hate each other.

22
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:13,889
Hateful, somebody’s born in an X religion,

23
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:19,125
he hates the person who follows the Y religion.

24
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:23,155
While Those who came as counsellors

25
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:27,325
talked about complete unity,

26
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:31,147
complete oneness of human race,

27
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:37,709
despite that, human brain, in its freedom,

28
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:41,975
did all kinds of wrong things

29
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:47,432
and created a country or,

30
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:53,996
you can say the whole world, full of lots of problems

31
00:07:54,362 --> 00:07:57,777
arising out of religion.

32
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:05,372
How can it be that religion makes you hate somebody?

33
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:10,879
Religion is there to understand love,

34
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:14,247
imbibe love and compassion.

35
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:25,076
So the third thing one had to do is the Adi Shakti’s job,

36
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:29,955
that is the one Kundalini within us.

37
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:39,049
And, by the awakening, we got pure knowledge, absolute knowledge,

38
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,891
pure knowledge that it cannot be challenged.

39
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:48,172
Absolute it is!

40
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:53,447
Whatever you know after Realization is absolute.

41
00:08:55,626 --> 00:09:00,567
If you know that, then what you have to understand,

42
00:09:01,158 --> 00:09:06,779
that everything has to be united.

43
00:09:08,576 --> 00:09:14,977
You cannot have fights and you cannot hate anyone.

44
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:19,205
If that thing starts happening,

45
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:24,433
all the problems of the world will be finished.

46
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:27,714
So the first thing, redemption,

47
00:09:28,113 --> 00:09:31,462
that is the quality of the Adi Shakti,

48
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:39,444
was to redeem people of their all wrong ideas about others.

49
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:45,579
Firstly, as we know, there are six enemies we have got.

50
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:52,770
And unless and until we can conquer those six enemies,

51
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:56,997
we cannot be a religious person. That is what is said,

52
00:09:57,362 --> 00:10:01,443
but actually the all religions are based only

53
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:06,523
on prospering those six enemies that we have within ourselves.

54
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:12,194
When you see this clearly, you start seeking,

55
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:15,416
you start seeking, seeking

56
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:21,585
earnest, the Truth.

57
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:26,524
And the revelation of truth,

58
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:32,114
absolute truth, can only come through your evolution,

59
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:34,247
through your reformation

60
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:41,203
that you become person who knows the Truth.

61
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,908
For that, Adi Shakti’s ascent is important within you,

62
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,861
which is your Kundalini.

63
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:52,977
And when this thing takes place,

64
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:58,609
automatically you drop all those six enemies that you have.

65
00:11:00,655 --> 00:11:06,357
You become a beautiful human being.

66
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:13,164
Like lotus, when it is in the very germinating state,

67
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:18,192
it looks like all other small

68
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:25,907
animals, or small, you can say, very, very,

69
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:28,752
small dirty things that are in the pond.

70
00:11:31,163 --> 00:11:33,944
And then, once it starts coming out,

71
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:41,895
coming out of that horrible water,

72
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:46,352
it becomes such a beautiful flower,

73
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:52,448
rises up and opens out.
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi,

74
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:59,090
though he lives along with all these horrible things
that are going on,

75
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:03,729
but flowers like a lotus.

76
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:07,267
It doesn’t have all these insects,

77
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:12,452
all this dirt and filth of that water in which it lives.

78
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:17,602
It sucks only the pure water

79
00:12:18,191 --> 00:12:23,146
and the remnant, the others remain there as it is.

80
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,620
So what is left within you

81
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:32,418
is nothing but purity, beauty and fragrance,

82
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:36,510
just like a lotus.

83
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:44,257
Then there is no more the problem of getting attacked

84
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,579
by all of these small, small creatures in the water

85
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:53,551
or all the dirty things that are in the water.

86
00:12:56,923 --> 00:13:00,521
And this state that you have achieved now,

87
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:05,914
I’m very happy to see so many people in America have achieved it.

88
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:09,672
You see, it’s a very great blessing,

89
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:15,846
because America is the leading country in so many ways.

90
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:21,168
One can say that it has made lots of money.

91
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:28,263
That is not the criteria of becoming a very good Sahaja Yogi.

92
00:13:29,952 --> 00:13:32,943
What you get is the satisfaction,

93
00:13:33,884 --> 00:13:41,729
satisfaction that you enjoy whatever you have
and whatever others have.

94
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:46,801
And the second thing that happens to you,

95
00:13:46,912 --> 00:13:49,515
you become absolutely collective.

96
00:13:50,352 --> 00:13:52,550
This has to happen.

97
00:13:53,523 --> 00:13:59,469
But I find still people have not understood
the meaning of collectivity.

98
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:05,873
For example, family is very, very weak here.

99
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:14,771
Family that has been created by natural relationships

100
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:19,206
is not so much respected as it should have.

101
00:14:20,353 --> 00:14:24,957
It’s all because, based on money, so people start

102
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:31,285
quarrelling, fighting and even killing each other.

103
00:14:34,126 --> 00:14:39,873
Now the basis of family is love and compassion.

104
00:14:40,617 --> 00:14:44,692
Those who do not have this cannot have good families.

105
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:48,997
I’ve seen even among Sahaja Yogis sometimes,

106
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:52,985
some people who are working for money,

107
00:14:53,864 --> 00:14:59,172
who are educated, sometimes look down upon people

108
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:01,948
who are not so well off.

109
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:06,030
Or maybe the housewives who are working in the house,

110
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:10,206
looking after the children, building up the families

111
00:15:10,364 --> 00:15:16,887
are not treated with respect as some secretary in the

112
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,523
some organization.

113
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:26,217
I don’t know why this kind of a manliness comes into women.

114
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,414
Why should they think they are something higher

115
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:33,140
than the women who are working hard

116
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:37,936
in the household, cooking, looking after children,

117
00:15:38,462 --> 00:15:43,280
bearing all the brunt of the society.

118
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:50,542
This is something, I feel, is a part which is lacking very much

119
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:54,703
in America and also Western countries.

120
00:15:55,683 --> 00:15:58,243
When money becomes important,

121
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:01,351
if when money is important,

122
00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:07,676
then the Lakshmi principle is not respected.

123
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:09,708
Very surprising.

124
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:13,489
Money is the part which is the blessing of the Lakshmi,

125
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:15,917
but the Gruha Lakshmi is the one

126
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:19,345
who is a householder, is not respected.

127
00:16:20,556 --> 00:16:23,051
And with this, I tell you,

128
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:28,049
there’s a… very, very wrong things can happen.

129
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:32,793
You can work, you can be educated,

130
00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:37,048
but you should be able to look after your family

131
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:42,674
and look after their comfort and look after their unity.

132
00:16:44,021 --> 00:16:47,405
Instead of that, educated women,

133
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:50,628
I call them manly women,

134
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:55,583
educated women think that they are something higher,
they are sadly mistaken.

135
00:16:56,729 --> 00:17:00,068
In no way, a man is higher than a woman.

136
00:17:01,122 --> 00:17:04,142
So this kind of a disparity that exists

137
00:17:04,713 --> 00:17:08,109
and one starts thinking that: “We are earning.

138
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:10,257
We are educated”

139
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:13,725
are really manly women, I must say.

140
00:17:14,563 --> 00:17:18,840
But the women who work very hard in a household with love,

141
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:23,866
look after the children, look after the family,

142
00:17:24,183 --> 00:17:28,763
are in no way less than these people who are working in the office.

143
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:32,729
So, such women must be respected

144
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:36,637
by their husbands, by the men,

145
00:17:36,962 --> 00:17:39,269
members  of the family — not only that,

146
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:42,680
but all the Sahaja Yogis must respect such women,

147
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:46,236
who are doing such a difficult task.

148
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:50,383
I’ve been a housewife and I know what it is

149
00:17:51,408 --> 00:17:54,904
to run the house, to look after the children,

150
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:59,310
to look after the complete organization

151
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:03,631
and looking after the expenditure

152
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:06,963
of the money, if that is limited.

153
00:18:08,368 --> 00:18:11,744
This ego has to go.

154
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:17,188
The other day, one lady, she came in interview and asked Me

155
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:23,131
that: “How is it, in this world of men, you are so much respected?”

156
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:28,828
World of men —I was really laughing.

157
00:18:29,196 --> 00:18:33,429
What makes her think that is the world of men, I can’t understand.

158
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:36,349
Can they exist without women?”

159
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:41,643
But I was amazed at her question because she said

160
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:46,691
that: “Even in the jail, criminals are so much respectful,

161
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:48,861
how is it possible?

162
00:18:49,056 --> 00:18:52,893
How can they have so much respect for a women?”

163
00:18:53,686 --> 00:18:57,450
I said: “I can’t understand one thing,

164
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,438
that criminals have got mothers or not?”

165
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:06,688
They are all males, don’t they have a mother?

166
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:12,140
They all have a mother and they respect the mother.

167
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:15,414
That’s the point one should know,

168
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:19,807
that woman is a much more important thing

169
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:24,559
than the man is, as far as the children are concerned.

170
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:29,852
But I’ve seen even some ladies,

171
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:33,574
who think they are very capable, try to control everything

172
00:19:34,281 --> 00:19:36,155
and create problems.

173
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:40,784
And mother’s job is not to control.

174
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:44,960
Her job is to love, to give compassion

175
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,645
and this is the quality of women is lost

176
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:51,804
in these Western, so-called advanced,

177
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,571
It is a very dangerous thing. I personally think

178
00:19:56,881 --> 00:20:01,547
that, if such a thing happens, families will be destroyed.

179
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:07,122
Nobody will have respect for the lady who looks after the family.

180
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:12,003
And she is more than a prime minister, I would say, in a family

181
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,797
and she’s to be respected and to be understood.

182
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:21,032
Today, I think it is important to say

183
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:25,929
that all of you should understand the value of women

184
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:28,199
who are housewives.

185
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,014
It’s a tremendous job

186
00:20:32,116 --> 00:20:35,391
to be a housewife. I have gone through it and I know what it is.

187
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:40,835
If the respect for the housewife is not given…

188
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:46,662
She will also look after the children.

189
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:50,318
Children are tomorrow’s citizens.

190
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:54,271
Who will groom them? Who will bring them up?

191
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:58,785
All those manly women don’t also have children sometimes,

192
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:01,958
so they don’t know what is the problem of children.

193
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:06,285
At least those who are solving the problem of their children,

194
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:09,704
you must understand their responsibility.

195
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:15,502
This is a very, very crucial point, I think on which

196
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:18,997
all the Western societies are collapsing,

197
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:22,812
because in their culture there is no place for the mother.

198
00:21:26,914 --> 00:21:29,799
So, the women should not feel in any way less

199
00:21:29,994 --> 00:21:32,807
if they are mothers and looking after the household.

200
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:35,539
They should not feel inferior to anybody

201
00:21:35,655 --> 00:21:39,030
who thinks that they are something great.

202
00:21:40,754 --> 00:21:44,266
Basically, the families have to be good.

203
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:48,398
This collectivity must work first in the family.

204
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,824
The children are to be groomed properly.

205
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:54,780
They are to be brought up in a proper way.

206
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:58,047
As it is, in these days, you know what is happening to the children.

207
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:02,439
When I read about it, I’m really shocked that

208
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:08,194
children are just treated as if they’re some unwanted stuff.

209
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:11,840
They are not given any attention.

210
00:22:12,438 --> 00:22:17,205
Ultimately, the children become drug addicts,

211
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:20,998
they become vagabonds or anything. They can become anything,

212
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:24,575
because there’s so much, so much neglect

213
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:27,864
and so much of hatred for children.

214
00:22:29,555 --> 00:22:34,019
So one has to first remember that, for collectivity,

215
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,288
you must look after your children.

216
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,736
Not only that, with love and compassion,

217
00:22:45,954 --> 00:22:52,285
not as somebody who is trying to become a despot out of it,

218
00:22:52,718 --> 00:22:57,140
but a person who is a source,

219
00:22:57,493 --> 00:23:01,070
who is a source of joy and compassion.

220
00:23:02,634 --> 00:23:06,471
In one of My lectures, I talked to you about

221
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:10,041
the emotional intelligence.

222
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:15,752
That is what we should try to imbibe.

223
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:20,144
Emotional intelligence, that means

224
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,435
the intelligence that is based on emotions.

225
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:30,168
Unless and until we become emotionally intelligent,

226
00:23:30,305 --> 00:23:32,361
our society cannot work.

227
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:37,582
In an emotional intelligence, you care

228
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:40,678
and you enjoy caring.

229
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:46,413
You do everything for others

230
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:50,711
with a great emotional understanding.

231
00:23:50,885 --> 00:23:53,854
Not for one child, not for one son,

232
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:59,668
but for everyone you have to be emotionally intelligent.

233
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:04,781
Some children are born like this, but some are to be made like that,

234
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:08,567
that they should be emotionally intelligent.

235
00:24:10,243 --> 00:24:15,400
Because, if the mother and father are money-oriented,

236
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:20,772
very selfish, they wouldn’t allow their child

237
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,462
to give anything to others.

238
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:28,799
So such a child will grow into a very funny type of a person

239
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:34,323
and will never do anything for anybody not even for his own country.

240
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:38,585
Why should he? Everything for selfishness.

241
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:43,042
Then such people indulge into corruption,

242
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,128
indulge into all kinds of things,

243
00:24:46,323 --> 00:24:50,340
which are only selfish in attitude.

244
00:24:51,832 --> 00:24:54,487
Now we are talking of collectivity.

245
00:24:55,186 --> 00:24:58,474
In collectivity, we do for others.

246
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:01,820
We enjoy doing for others.

247
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:06,601
We love giving things to others, not for yourself,

248
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,323
because your children will also become the same kind

249
00:25:10,518 --> 00:25:13,006
and they will only bother about themselves.

250
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:20,282
This emotional intelligence has to be brought in our life.

251
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:25,517
In our pattern that we have, are we emotionally

252
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:32,484
intelligent or we are just intelligent or emotional?

253
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:34,978
Both things are wrong.

254
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:38,751
If you are just intelligent, you can become very dry person.

255
00:25:39,754 --> 00:25:44,960
You may just have few friends maybe, you may not have

256
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,560
and you will always try to preserve yourself away

257
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,295
from the collectivity.

258
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:57,292
And if you are emotional, you’ll be attached to only one person,

259
00:25:58,828 --> 00:26:02,816
attached to one child, attached to one person,

260
00:26:03,176 --> 00:26:06,263
to someone, even in the society.

261
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:11,023
For no rhyme or reason. Why? Why are you attached to one person?

262
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:16,013
Why you bothered about one person only?

263
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,239
All such people fall into such terrible play.

264
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:22,841
In the politics you have seen how,

265
00:26:22,986 --> 00:26:25,142
people try to help their own sons

266
00:26:25,243 --> 00:26:27,696
and own daughters and this and that.

267
00:26:27,797 --> 00:26:30,386
And we Indians have suffered a lot with this

268
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:33,458
kind of an emotional attachment.

269
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:43,466
So, according to ethics,

270
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:49,561
emotional intelligence is the highest quality,

271
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:54,854
by which you give to others,

272
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,071
you care for others, for everyone

273
00:27:01,304 --> 00:27:04,398
and you become very, very collective.

274
00:27:08,047 --> 00:27:11,926
Now exclusiveness is another fashion

275
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,697
that’s very miserable, it’s exclusive.

276
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:18,284
because you don’t want to be one of the multitudes.

277
00:27:18,393 --> 00:27:20,711
You want to be exclusive.

278
00:27:21,688 --> 00:27:29,296
You should be exclusive in emotional intelligence,
not on other things.

279
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,040
That is the best thing that you can have.

280
00:27:33,414 --> 00:27:37,597
As I agree, I am just a woman and just a mother,

281
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:44,579
but what I have is really the emotional intelligence,

282
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:51,358
ocean of it, and from that I know about everyone,

283
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:55,265
I understand about everyone.

284
00:27:55,922 --> 00:28:01,122
And all this work has been done because of that quality in My head.

285
00:28:01,476 --> 00:28:06,905
I’m not attached to one person or to one style.

286
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,614
Whatever you say, I can understand,

287
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,495
because I am at a level

288
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:17,536
where I can understand everything that you are doing.

289
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:23,766
To achieve that, you try to develop emotional intelligence.

290
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:28,994
Here the children won’t even give a toy to somebody to play with.

291
00:28:31,222 --> 00:28:35,873
Even the mother is like that, the father is like that,
extremely selfish

292
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,898
and: “We must have our own, you see, everything should be our own.”

293
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:47,748
This has to go. This has to go, from Americans especially, because

294
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:53,166
they are the leading nation in this kind of selfishness.

295
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:59,418
What selfishness they have done, I need not count,
but you know that.

296
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:03,326
You go and ask the people of Canada, Mexico,

297
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:05,872
Peru, all this, they will tell you.

298
00:29:06,766 --> 00:29:09,687
Being selfish, they are not ashamed.

299
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:13,292
They are exploiters, they are not ashamed.

300
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:21,139
Nobody can even tell them,
because they think they are very rich people.

301
00:29:22,422 --> 00:29:27,485
But all these riches will not give them the joy of life.

302
00:29:28,956 --> 00:29:34,344
Joy of life is only in the emotional intelligence.

303
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:38,540
If you don’t have that, it becomes very dry.

304
00:29:38,742 --> 00:29:42,319
Life becomes very odd, unbearable, horrible

305
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:47,324
and even the family gets broken,

306
00:29:48,175 --> 00:29:51,203
if there is no emotional intelligence in the family.

307
00:29:52,253 --> 00:29:54,445
I have known so many women

308
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:57,374
who have had three marriages, five marriages.

309
00:29:57,475 --> 00:29:59,098
I don’t know how they can do it.

310
00:29:59,335 --> 00:30:03,490
But they’ve done because of this lack of emotional intelligence.

311
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:09,677
It is something that is a sense of giving.

312
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,545
It's not that your sacrifising anything, no.

313
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:16,420
That’s also another idea,

314
00:30:16,557 --> 00:30:19,593
that we are to bear this —nothing of the kind.

315
00:30:20,956 --> 00:30:23,840
Look at the life of Christ, He gave His life.

316
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,020
Why? What was the need for Him to do that?

317
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:30,172
Behind Him was the Truth.

318
00:30:30,987 --> 00:30:34,189
When you have the Truth with you, the light of the Truth,

319
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:37,204
the force of the Truth, the strength of the Truth,

320
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,836
you become emotionally intelligent.

321
00:30:42,413 --> 00:30:45,956
You understand that, if you really love something,

322
00:30:46,122 --> 00:30:51,862
then you have to undergo every kind of trouble.

323
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:54,674
You have to tolerate lot of nonsense.

324
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:56,657
I know it’s too much to say,

325
00:30:56,801 --> 00:31:03,174
but I thought that, for this special Puja, I should say something

326
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,136
about the family life.

327
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,832
In our ashrams or in our programs

328
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,281
or wherever we are, we should remember this point,

329
00:31:14,577 --> 00:31:20,288
that: “Are we having that emotional intelligence

330
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:22,993
when we are trying to talk among Sahaja Yoga?”

331
00:31:24,846 --> 00:31:29,094
Why do I need to be every place to tell them? What is the need?

332
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:31,206
You can tell them.

333
00:31:31,596 --> 00:31:34,748
If you have that emotional intelligence,

334
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:37,920
everybody will listen to you. Why not?

335
00:31:38,184 --> 00:31:40,708
Not necessary I should go everywhere

336
00:31:40,842 --> 00:31:43,627
and talk to them. How many countries can I do?

337
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:47,066
And the reaction to it is so beautiful

338
00:31:47,297 --> 00:31:50,413
and so nice. It’s very surprising.

339
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:54,588
Like in a country like Benin country, all Muslims there,

340
00:31:54,906 --> 00:31:59,794
all black people, they all have become Sahaja Yogis. Nine thousand.

341
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:03,894
How could I capture that?

342
00:32:04,396 --> 00:32:08,476
Just think of that. Nine thousand people come to you!

343
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:12,124
Then also other countries I have seen.

344
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:16,574
Just this is the power of emotional intelligence

345
00:32:16,703 --> 00:32:19,220
that captures the heart of the people.

346
00:32:20,526 --> 00:32:25,160
You may have any amount of property, money, everything,

347
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:28,362
people will abhor you. Alright.

348
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:31,622
So you may say: “What’s wrong? What’s wrong with this?”

349
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:40,348
That you are harming the greatest thing, is the human being.

350
00:32:42,181 --> 00:32:45,483
And the politicians they are horrible, as they say.

351
00:32:46,118 --> 00:32:49,327
Why? Because they have no emotional intelligence.

352
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:57,152
Also as administrators, they are very much difficult,

353
00:32:57,246 --> 00:32:59,503
because they have no emotional intelligence.

354
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:06,505
All these people are devoid of that great quality

355
00:33:06,786 --> 00:33:08,755
of emotional intelligence.

356
00:33:09,837 --> 00:33:12,274
If your country is very progressive,

357
00:33:12,418 --> 00:33:16,003
I must say, you must progress in emotional intelligence.

358
00:33:16,858 --> 00:33:19,267
That way, they have philanthropists, I know.

359
00:33:19,753 --> 00:33:22,089
Americans are known to be philanthropists.

360
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:26,185
But behind that is they want to have power.

361
00:33:29,185 --> 00:33:31,622
They want to rule people with that money.

362
00:33:32,956 --> 00:33:37,616
It’s not emotional intelligence, it’s they just want to rule.

363
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:41,394
If they start some sort of a charity,

364
00:33:41,913 --> 00:33:46,038
that is just to have a big name on the television,

365
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:51,945
or to have a very great advertisement about, “Oh, him!”

366
00:33:52,148 --> 00:33:55,270
and then he moves like a tycoon all over.

367
00:33:56,618 --> 00:34:00,331
We part of their  [UNCLEAR]   we part of their property

368
00:34:01,046 --> 00:34:04,276
work it out and make such a fuss about it,

369
00:34:04,557 --> 00:34:07,370
because they want to cash everything…

370
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:09,945
Cash has been lots of cashed  in

371
00:34:10,912 --> 00:34:13,072
You are Sahaja Yogis.

372
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:17,795
You have to send waves of emotional intelligence.

373
00:34:18,293 --> 00:34:22,411
You have to send love to all over the world.

374
00:34:23,023 --> 00:34:27,141
You have to show how you can, with love, win over.

375
00:34:27,812 --> 00:34:31,800
It is also possible, if you are not so attached.

376
00:34:32,268 --> 00:34:35,564
If you are attached, say to your country only—

377
00:34:35,861 --> 00:34:37,541
now this is a bigger issue —

378
00:34:37,762 --> 00:34:41,651
then you will try to exploit other countries,

379
00:34:41,948 --> 00:34:45,344
take advantage of them, try to run them down.

380
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:48,386
But if you are emotionally attached to your country,

381
00:34:48,611 --> 00:34:53,053
then you’ll bring good name to your country by doing real good work.

382
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:58,079
I don’t know why people do not know how to discriminate.

383
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:01,966
Why are they so selfish, trying to bring them up,

384
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:07,267
trying to do all the good things for themselves?

385
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:14,131
There is a very great chance for all of you

386
00:35:15,062 --> 00:35:17,895
to get this within your reach,

387
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,226
because you are all Sahaja Yogis.

388
00:35:20,593 --> 00:35:22,706
You have become like lotuses.

389
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:26,825
And the lotus has the fragrance which spreads all over

390
00:35:27,796 --> 00:35:31,771
and, days together it stays in the water, in that dirty water,

391
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:34,879
and it spreads the fragrance.

392
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:38,313
With that fragrance also, you can do lots of things,

393
00:35:38,578 --> 00:35:42,653
that the bees come there, they sleep in that

394
00:35:43,562 --> 00:35:46,410
beautiful house of the lotus

395
00:35:46,864 --> 00:35:50,723
and in the night it closes down very carefully.

396
00:35:51,054 --> 00:35:53,939
All kinds of things that come from the flower

397
00:35:58,334 --> 00:36:10,153
to take the beauty

398
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:12,140
of that flower,

399
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:16,341
we can say, because you can extract also

400
00:36:16,482 --> 00:36:19,122
the essence of that, which has fragrance.

401
00:36:19,756 --> 00:36:23,904
You can also get some honey out of that.

402
00:36:24,134 --> 00:36:28,029
Whatever is possible, everybody comes to that flower.

403
00:36:28,928 --> 00:36:32,405
That doesn’t mean that flower in any way is weak,

404
00:36:32,577 --> 00:36:36,688
but that’s its quality, that’s its strength,
that’s its understanding.

405
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:43,706
That’s what you are. You are all made into lotuses.

406
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:47,665
You are not made into some sort of creeps

407
00:36:47,824 --> 00:36:52,735
or some sort of stupid donkeys, no!

408
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:59,418
You are the people who are to give fragrance of your love,

409
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:03,168
fragrance of your compassion to others.

410
00:37:03,363 --> 00:37:05,324
And you should feel happy about it.

411
00:37:06,096 --> 00:37:08,209
That doesn’t mean that you give up this,

412
00:37:08,317 --> 00:37:10,106
give up that. Nothing of the kind.

413
00:37:10,524 --> 00:37:12,817
But it means that, whatever you have,

414
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,406
whatever is your possibility, capability,

415
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:19,783
you must try to do for others, give it to them.

416
00:37:20,892 --> 00:37:23,646
And the more you do in this collectivity…

417
00:37:23,863 --> 00:37:27,772
That’s what is very important, at least for America,

418
00:37:27,981 --> 00:37:31,169
because everybody is trying to follow America,

419
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:35,322
money-making business, this business, that thing.

420
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,960
But you are all Sahaja Yogis,

421
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:42,134
so what you have to do is take

422
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:48,739
advantage of your achievement and give this to others,

423
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:53,218
give Realisation to others. Many people who get Realisation

424
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:55,699
don’t even bother about it.

425
00:37:56,535 --> 00:37:59,246
They just don’t go and spread Sahaja Yoga.

426
00:37:59,787 --> 00:38:01,748
They are not bothered about it.

427
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,482
Which is sometimes very shocking to Me,

428
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,644
because what was the need for Me

429
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:10,656
to go around the whole world with all the mad people living,

430
00:38:10,843 --> 00:38:13,193
and talking to them about Sahaja Yoga?

431
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,755
In the same way, you should also feel now

432
00:38:16,972 --> 00:38:19,721
that:  “We have to do this work, we have to change the world.

433
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:22,013
We have to get them into Sahaja Yoga.”

434
00:38:22,158 --> 00:38:24,342
Why can’t we? We are so many people.

435
00:38:24,487 --> 00:38:26,542
Christ had only twelve disciples,

436
00:38:26,686 --> 00:38:29,060
and how much they spread Christianity!

437
00:38:30,047 --> 00:38:34,063
What about you people? You are so well equipped,

438
00:38:34,236 --> 00:38:36,313
you have so much of knowledge,

439
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:40,821
absolute knowledge and experience.

440
00:38:41,463 --> 00:38:44,304
So if you have the experience and the knowledge,

441
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,850
you can capture the people.

442
00:38:47,498 --> 00:38:50,975
But there is some sort of a lurking ambition,

443
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:56,802
which goes against, against the culture of Sahaja Yoga.

444
00:38:57,479 --> 00:38:59,144
You want to be leader,

445
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:01,035
or you want to put down somebody,

446
00:39:01,158 --> 00:39:03,977
or you think no end of yourself. That’s no good.

447
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,460
And also they do Sahaja Yoga or spread Sahaja Yoga

448
00:39:07,568 --> 00:39:09,502
because they want to enhance themselves.

449
00:39:12,543 --> 00:39:16,995
This is not the way. The way is a complete surrendering,

450
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:21,375
complete surrender to the work of Sahaja Yoga.

451
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:25,954
It’s possible, it’s not difficult at all, as I’m telling you.

452
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,929
It’s very, very simple.

453
00:39:28,102 --> 00:39:30,349
Only thing, you should understand

454
00:39:30,472 --> 00:39:35,392
that you have a special place in the whole universe today.

455
00:39:37,395 --> 00:39:39,458
You are not to rot.

456
00:39:40,157 --> 00:39:42,487
You are not to waste your life.

457
00:39:44,203 --> 00:39:46,373
We have started marriages,

458
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:49,706
and in America also they said.
I said: “Alright, we’ll have marriages.”

459
00:39:50,009 --> 00:39:53,139
But these marriages, what is the outcome?

460
00:39:53,383 --> 00:39:56,543
If they are like all other ordinary marriages, what’s the use?

461
00:39:57,118 --> 00:39:59,627
What are they doing for others?

462
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:02,267
What sort of children they are producing?

463
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:04,373
You have to see to it

464
00:40:04,621 --> 00:40:09,083
that you become married couples in Sahaja Yoga.

465
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:13,382
Your family should be a different type,

466
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:17,038
your love for your family should be of a different type.

467
00:40:17,743 --> 00:40:21,018
The whole family of Sahaja Yoga also needs your family.

468
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,407
So, for everyone, you must have compassion and love.

469
00:40:26,401 --> 00:40:28,558
I know some people grow very fast,

470
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,745
but some don’t, because they lack this

471
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:35,403
balance between emotion and intelligence.

472
00:40:35,878 --> 00:40:39,765
This balance has to be completely established.

473
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:44,799
And I know, one day, this America will lead so many people,

474
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:50,128
so many people, thousands, in Sahaja Yoga.

475
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:53,892
So far, whatever was wrong was adopted:

476
00:40:54,391 --> 00:40:57,953
drug addiction starts, then another thing starts.

477
00:40:58,198 --> 00:41:03,447
All kinds of nonsensical things started in this country.
Why?

478
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:09,859
Now, the new lotuses that are there,

479
00:41:10,162 --> 00:41:13,377
they have to change the atmosphere of this lake,

480
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:16,689
where all kinds of dirty things are coming up,

481
00:41:17,064 --> 00:41:20,785
immoral things are coming up, ruining the whole world.

482
00:41:21,433 --> 00:41:24,159
So, in our general attitude also,

483
00:41:25,313 --> 00:41:29,042
we should try to see: “Are we really following?

484
00:41:29,546 --> 00:41:32,106
Are we really doing what is to be done?

485
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:34,710
What are we doing for morality?”

486
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:38,712
That’s a very important point in Sahaja Yoga,

487
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,859
how you dress, how you walk, how you talk,

488
00:41:43,141 --> 00:41:45,231
everything’s very important,

489
00:41:45,751 --> 00:41:49,205
and all other things that you have, you should try.

490
00:41:49,711 --> 00:41:55,523
How to create, and all these things of different, different Chakras,

491
00:41:55,948 --> 00:41:58,349
you should try to concentrate on them

492
00:41:58,522 --> 00:42:00,902
and see for yourself what are you doing?

493
00:42:02,532 --> 00:42:05,106
What are you making out of your life?

494
00:42:05,473 --> 00:42:08,453
You are Sahaja Yogis. You are special people.

495
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:11,518
You are not ordinary. I want to tell you

496
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,116
that you should have self-esteem. Try to understand

497
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:18,845
what is your quality, what are you.

498
00:42:19,689 --> 00:42:23,071
Thank you very much.
May God bless you!
