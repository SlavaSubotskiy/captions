00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,920
Birthday Puja
Calcutta, India

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,920
21 March 1994

3
00:00:02,945 --> 00:00:19,567
Every year we have birthdays of various people,
and every year we make a vow that this year

4
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:27,587
I will not do this or I will not do that.

5
00:00:27,587 --> 00:00:38,837
This is a very good way of seeing how far
we have come in life.

6
00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:59,387
Many people who really have achieved a very
great height in their spiritual life did not

7
00:00:59,387 --> 00:01:21,647
need a birthday, but every day they felt it's
a birthday to start, to go ahead, to understand,

8
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:22,997
to learn.

9
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:30,836
Every day is a new year for them.

10
00:01:30,836 --> 00:01:39,826
In our own life we see that our surroundings

11
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:45,897
change very slowly.

12
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:57,947
Sometimes it is shocking; sometimes you are
surprised how the surroundings are not changing.

13
00:01:57,947 --> 00:02:14,727
But, in a subtle way, there is a tremendous
change that is happening within us and without.

14
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:19,426
The whole atmosphere today is governed by

15
00:02:19,426 --> 00:02:23,837
human beings.

16
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:36,687
I don't know how far Paramachaitanya works
it out, but it is for us to open ourselves

17
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:43,117
to new dimensions in our lives.

18
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:54,867
For example, if we find we still have – through
our introspection – we locate that we have

19
00:02:54,867 --> 00:03:03,637
these old, subtle, nonsensical things still
hanging around us, we don't have to vow for

20
00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:05,747
it.

21
00:03:05,747 --> 00:03:16,816
You have to just witness it, and the destructive
path it is taking you to.

22
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:20,787
Immediately you will give up.

23
00:03:20,787 --> 00:03:31,546
You don't have to worry as to put a vow upon
yourself, because now you are samarth, meaning

24
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:44,486
now you are absolutely empowered.

25
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:55,876
Whatever you think is wrong, your attention
itself on it will slowly, gradually remove

26
00:03:55,876 --> 00:04:13,126
the doubts
about having those problems, those connections,

27
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:21,877
conditions and ego that are lingering still.

28
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:26,217
Definitely you will drop them.

29
00:04:26,217 --> 00:04:35,937
With your attention, it will run away.

30
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:45,987
Then you will realize that every day your
attention is getting purified, getting powerful,

31
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:50,067
getting compassionate.

32
00:04:50,067 --> 00:05:03,577
Normally, whatever reaction you have in your
attention just disappears, and you start witnessing

33
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:19,897
the whole thing, and your power of attention,
through that witnessing force, acts and it

34
00:05:19,897 --> 00:05:21,407
works.

35
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:32,167
It works not only on you, but on everything
that surrounds you.

36
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:37,287
Firstly, through your meditation, in that

37
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:45,627
state of meditation, you expand within yourself.

38
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:49,927
You stay in the present.

39
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:54,577
The other day, somebody asked Me, "Where was
Your last birthday?"

40
00:05:54,577 --> 00:06:00,257
I just forgot where it was.

41
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:05,957
Otherwise My memory is very good, like an
elephant.

42
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:10,247
But this I forgot.

43
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:27,507
Perhaps, every time, every day, you live in
the present, and you grow, so you forget when

44
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:34,507
and where this growth has taken place.

45
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:45,437
My own growth has been like this, that every

46
00:06:45,437 --> 00:07:03,767
time I go to a place, I find very nice new
people coming in and some of the horrible

47
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:08,917
ones from the old lot disappearing.

48
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:21,987
It's something like, when the tree grows,
the leaves go on falling and new leaves start

49
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:23,927
coming.

50
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:37,567
But in Sahaja Yoga, it's something different
I find, that on the tree of Sahaj Yoga very

51
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:50,887
few, very, very few leaves fall off, and you
sometimes face a lush garden of beautiful

52
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,667
people.

53
00:07:53,667 --> 00:08:06,687
To Me, it's like a miraculous fireworks.

54
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:19,227
It starts like a small line and then opens
up into several beautiful patterns.

55
00:08:19,227 --> 00:08:34,187
It is impossible to envisage or to visualize
what will happen to us, to Sahaj Yog and to

56
00:08:34,187 --> 00:08:40,007
all of you.

57
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:53,927
I have never learned to imagine things, but
the vision that you see is really remarkable,

58
00:08:53,927 --> 00:09:08,987
is very remarkable, that I see all Sahaja
yogis drenched in divine love and expressing

59
00:09:08,987 --> 00:09:26,677
themselves in a very beautiful and very deep
manner.

60
00:09:26,677 --> 00:09:43,737
This, when comes in, that really makes your
attention absolutely enwrapped in such divine

61
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:47,917
bliss that you forget that moment.

62
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:52,407
One of those moments are when you celebrate

63
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:54,307
My Birthday.

64
00:09:54,307 --> 00:10:01,557
I even forget how many years I have lived
on this Earth.

65
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:08,107
Sometimes I say I am seventy-three, sometimes
I say I am seventy – I just don't know.

66
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:23,167
Because, as I told you, it does not leave
any mark of time, of date, of years, in that

67
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:24,617
blissful state.

68
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:34,477
As if sometimes you can think that you went
to see something very beautiful, like Taj

69
00:10:34,477 --> 00:10:45,277
Mahal, without knowing what it is, and suddenly
you find such a beautiful building, unexpectedly.

70
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:52,877
You just get blindfolded, as they say.

71
00:10:52,877 --> 00:10:53,877
In Hindi, say awak.

72
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:57,947
You don't know how to express.

73
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:00,707
You become speechless.

74
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:07,797
And invariably you'll find, that time you'll
forget the time.

75
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:12,507
You will forget how you came there.

76
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:21,756
All the story behind all that finishes off
as soon as you see the reality of the vision.

77
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:29,427
This reality of the vision is something beyond

78
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:37,697
even My thinking and imagination.

79
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:50,567
I cannot, even now, sometimes, believe that
there are so many Sahaja yogis who have got

80
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:55,817
this subtle knowledge.

81
00:11:55,817 --> 00:12:02,737
I never knew that there are so many seekers,
to begin with.

82
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:07,337
I never knew that there are such subtle people
on this Earth.

83
00:12:07,337 --> 00:12:24,577
All over the world, wherever I went, whether
I went to Nepal or to Brazil, suddenly I find

84
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:32,437
facing so many beautiful seekers.

85
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:35,677
If you ask Me, "When did You go to Brazil?"

86
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:38,357
I won't be able to tell you the dates.

87
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:45,437
I have very bad memory for dates for the same
reason, I think, because every time I see

88
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:47,647
a vision.

89
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:55,517
And the time also just stops for that moment.

90
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:59,877
It doesn't express itself.

91
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:05,237
Nothing is recorded, except for the experience.

92
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:13,067
And this experience is in an abstract form.

93
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:16,607
You cannot describe.

94
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:25,527
It is beyond words and beyond any description.

95
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:43,657
At that time you really become thoughtless,
and that is the time we have to really enjoy.

96
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:46,747
The greatest curse of modern times is the

97
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:52,057
watch, all the time that we keep.

98
00:13:52,057 --> 00:14:06,217
And all the time we are just seeing the time,
what time it is now, and after two seconds

99
00:14:06,217 --> 00:14:12,717
again also you want to see what is the time.

100
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:17,677
We have crossed the limits of time – kalatit.

101
00:14:17,677 --> 00:14:24,337
Try to understand why we have crossed, because
time moves according to us.

102
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:29,777
You can experience it.

103
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:37,847
The other day I was coming from Delhi, and
in My household everybody seems to be very

104
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:40,787
particular about time.

105
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:43,117
So they were after My life, "Come along, come
along.

106
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:44,257
Getting late, getting late.

107
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:49,317
Now, you can't just get into the plane," this,
that.

108
00:14:49,317 --> 00:14:51,507
All right.

109
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:55,727
And when I reached there, they said that "The
plane is still waiting.

110
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:59,527
It's not … it's not necessary for you to
hurry up.

111
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:04,977
It will take at least fifteen, twenty minutes
for you to go."

112
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:11,097
So, also this name of "airport" makes people
really jumpy, I should say.

113
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:17,097
They have to go to the aeroplane means as
if some war is there or I don't know what

114
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:20,827
it is.

115
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:27,257
So far, luckily, I have never missed a plane,
never missed a train in My lifetime.

116
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:31,547
Though I travel, I think, quite a lot.

117
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:41,386
I have every time found, invariably, that
the plane itself is waiting for Me.

118
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:43,177
It won't leave.

119
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:50,727
Like, I'll give you a very interesting example
today, if you are relaxed.

120
00:15:50,727 --> 00:16:11,256
We were in Prague, and we were supposed to
go to Poland via – again same thing happens

121
00:16:11,256 --> 00:16:16,037
to Me with experience I had – via Vienna.

122
00:16:16,037 --> 00:16:21,977
And we had a very great Sahaja yogi with us
who told Me that the plane will be leaving

123
00:16:21,977 --> 00:16:24,777
at eleven o'clock.

124
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:28,437
And from the airport he rings Me up, "No,
the plane is leaving at 9:30."

125
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:35,877
If I want, I can be ready in five minutes
or I can take two hours, depends on.

126
00:16:35,877 --> 00:16:36,877
So I was ready.

127
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:37,937
I just jumped into the car.

128
00:16:37,937 --> 00:16:44,997
We reached the airport, but we were late by
fifteen minutes, and the ground lady started

129
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:52,187
shouting at Me at the top of her voice, "You
people, you are VIPs, you are this, you are

130
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:53,187
that."

131
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:55,477
All kinds of things she said to Me.

132
00:16:55,477 --> 00:16:58,946
And this Sahaja yogi could not bear it.

133
00:16:58,946 --> 00:17:06,077
And he felt that it was his mistake – he
told Me a wrong time, “That's why this lady

134
00:17:06,077 --> 00:17:08,946
is shouting at my Mother.”

135
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:15,057
He couldn't bear it.

136
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:21,167
He was very unhappy.

137
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:35,286
So, we went into the aeroplane with this lady
shouting behind, and we saw that the pilot

138
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:40,347
and engineers, they were busy with some correction
of the machinery.

139
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:43,407
They said, "It is little bit out of order.

140
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:44,407
It will be ready."

141
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:45,537
So we sat down.

142
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:53,867
Now this Sahaja yogi could not bear it, and
his tears started rolling down his eyes.

143
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:57,777
The another Sahaj yogini, she said, “Brother,
it's all right.

144
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,347
Don't cry."

145
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:00,357
They were sitting behind Me.

146
00:18:00,357 --> 00:18:01,687
I just turned round.

147
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:05,167
I said, "It's all right.

148
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,167
Don't worry."

149
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,547
He said, "No Mother, because of me she could
say all these things, you know.

150
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,187
I can't bear it."

151
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:14,337
And he couldn't stop crying.

152
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:26,797
Within one minute, the sky which was absolutely
open was covered with big clouds like huge,

153
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:31,727
big elephants walking into the whole area
– very big.

154
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:41,717
All the Sahaja yogis who were standing also
– on the other side, on top of the airport

155
00:18:41,717 --> 00:18:43,807
– saw it happening.

156
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:46,367
The whole thing became absolutely jet-black.

157
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:49,657
"Oh, My God," I said.

158
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:54,657
"See, the tears of this gentleman has such
powers."

159
00:18:54,657 --> 00:19:02,477
And then the airport people told us that this
plane is out of order, so we have to get down.

160
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:04,767
So we got down.

161
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:06,497
We came back.

162
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:14,447
Then he went to this ground hostess and told
her, "Now, whom should we shout at?

163
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:17,837
Now the plane is not going, should we shout
at you?

164
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:21,697
How dare you shout at my Mother and all those
things you said?"

165
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:33,187
But all the people there at the airport, who
were still in … under the same regime style,

166
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:35,347
got such a fright.

167
00:19:35,347 --> 00:19:38,097
The manager himself walked to Me.

168
00:19:38,097 --> 00:19:43,977
He said, "For your plane there's still five
hours and if you want out we can give you

169
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:45,937
permission, all of you can go out."

170
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:48,416
And he took Me by a special way.

171
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,847
I couldn't understand this reaction.

172
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:59,107
So I went out and we did some shopping or
something, and when we came back we were surprised.

173
00:19:59,107 --> 00:20:06,137
All the airport was rather stunned by us and
when I walked – that was the only plane

174
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:11,567
that was leaving – all the traffic had stopped
except for this plane.

175
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:21,187
And when we walked down to board the plane,
the gentleman who was there said, "Mother,

176
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:24,117
can you help me?"

177
00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:25,117
I said, "How?"

178
00:20:25,117 --> 00:20:26,317
"I have got a terrible back pain."

179
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:28,987
I said, "How can I do it?"

180
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:34,087
Then one lady walked in to say, "Mother, please,
I have pain in my shoulder.

181
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:37,237
Can you put your hand on that?"

182
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:41,257
I just put My hand on her shoulder and she
said, "I am feeling all right."

183
00:20:41,257 --> 00:20:43,967
She started lifting her arm.

184
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:52,247
Then I went – I thought I'd better now take
to the aeroplane – when I was walking, the

185
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:53,897
same gentleman came to Me.

186
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:56,567
He said, "Why not put hand on my back?"

187
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:58,967
I said, "I have to board the plane."

188
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,727
He said, "I'll walk with You.

189
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,847
You just put your hand on my back.

190
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,497
I'm sure I'll be all right."

191
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:07,517
And we walked together about two minutes or
so.

192
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:10,487
He said, "I'm all right."

193
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:13,537
The whole atmosphere changed.

194
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:20,987
It was such a tremendous effect on these people
who have been under a regime and have been

195
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:25,437
really military-like, and the whole treatment
was so funny.

196
00:21:25,437 --> 00:21:36,627
The whole thing changed in such a short time,
and I was amazed how the tears of this Sahaja

197
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:39,647
yogi has worked this wonder.

198
00:21:39,647 --> 00:21:50,217
Now, imagine a moment when tears started rolling
his eyes, that moment just manifested a big

199
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:51,257
drama.

200
00:21:51,257 --> 00:22:03,827
And, ultimately, what you find is that the
people at the airport became extremely humble

201
00:22:03,827 --> 00:22:08,957
and respectful.

202
00:22:08,957 --> 00:22:14,747
So when we start thinking of time and time

203
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:22,957
and time, we have to understand that time
is our slave.

204
00:22:22,957 --> 00:22:25,237
We are not slaves of the time.

205
00:22:25,237 --> 00:22:34,197
There are thousand and one stories I can tell
you how, by delaying in a place, by getting

206
00:22:34,197 --> 00:22:43,467
late in a place, by not caring for the time,
I have seen such beautiful manifestations,

207
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:55,317
such beautiful dramas – the art of the divine
power – that I was amazed how people worry

208
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:59,786
so much about the time.

209
00:22:59,786 --> 00:23:13,217
If time is really necessary, if we are all
watching our time every year, as our birthday,

210
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:19,557
and if you think that time is very important,
it is in a way.

211
00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:28,397
In these modern times, we really need the
time for meditation, for collective meetings

212
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:33,187
and for Sahaja Yoga.

213
00:23:33,187 --> 00:23:42,137
I know when there was the war of independence
in this country, where My parents fought with

214
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:48,177
all their tana, mana, dhana [trans: body,
mind, wealth].

215
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:53,177
That time I remember how they never cared
for anything.

216
00:23:53,177 --> 00:24:04,087
They went all out, because it was very important
to get this country freed from the clutches

217
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:07,867
of the Empire.

218
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:13,997
And this was so important.

219
00:24:13,997 --> 00:24:21,237
They had to meet somebody at such a point:
that man, supposing, is escaping from the

220
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:26,817
jail, or there's some sort of a thing on,
they could not afford to miss the time.

221
00:24:26,817 --> 00:24:35,577
They could not afford to just neglect that
important time, important meeting, important

222
00:24:35,577 --> 00:24:39,937
discussion, because everything had become
an emergency.

223
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:46,177
For them, nobody told them, nobody gave them
lectures, but for them, from inside.

224
00:24:46,177 --> 00:24:55,037
They were all legendary people, I should say,
the way they fought for their freedom.

225
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:58,377
This is, today, the same situation.

226
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:04,027
It is an emergency, a very subtle emergency.

227
00:25:04,027 --> 00:25:12,027
That nothing is more important than spreading
Sahaja Yoga.

228
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:19,477
If some people will miss it, will not know
about it, we will be responsible for that.

229
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:27,406
At the time of Christ, Buddha, Mahavira or
any one of them, there were no aeroplanes

230
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:29,747
to travel.

231
00:25:29,747 --> 00:25:37,117
There were not these loudspeakers, also other
communications and televisions and all those

232
00:25:37,117 --> 00:25:39,357
things.

233
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:44,217
All these things have come now.

234
00:25:44,217 --> 00:25:47,197
That has been manifested now.

235
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:55,526
It is
the work of Paramachaitanya.

236
00:25:55,526 --> 00:26:06,047
Through scientists, through other knowledge,
all this manifestation have, has taken place.

237
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:12,547
Also, these people didn't have to face people,
so many, nor did they… were supposed to

238
00:26:12,547 --> 00:26:17,177
give realization to people in such a big number.

239
00:26:17,177 --> 00:26:31,557
So all these inventions, all that you see
today as modern ventures which we have got,

240
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:37,457
they are all for Sahaja Yoga.

241
00:26:37,457 --> 00:26:44,927
Without Sahaj Yog, you cannot imagine what
would happen to this world.

242
00:26:44,927 --> 00:26:49,987
The first and foremost thing is we have no

243
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:51,497
peace within our hearts.

244
00:26:51,497 --> 00:26:53,727
We talk of peace.

245
00:26:53,727 --> 00:26:59,707
I know of people, who have got awards in peace,
have no peace within their heart, no peace

246
00:26:59,707 --> 00:27:01,497
at all.

247
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:09,947
Unless and until we human beings have peace,
there cannot be peace in the whole world.

248
00:27:09,947 --> 00:27:12,286
It is we who create wars.

249
00:27:12,286 --> 00:27:16,067
It is we who do all kinds of violence.

250
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:24,757
It is we, we ruin the possibility of people
getting into the Kingdom of God.

251
00:27:24,757 --> 00:27:37,797
So, peace can be only achieved by establishing
peace in the hearts of the people.

252
00:27:37,797 --> 00:27:46,916
And that is only possible, that you achieve
the state of thoughtless awareness.

253
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,947
You remain in the present.

254
00:27:49,947 --> 00:27:58,837
And there, where you'll be amazed, you will
be standing like a rock, because you will

255
00:27:58,837 --> 00:28:01,317
have reality in your hand.

256
00:28:01,317 --> 00:28:03,057
You can work out the way you like.

257
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:07,877
Actually, I don't work out anything whatsoever,
really.

258
00:28:07,877 --> 00:28:09,776
You may say, "You do this and You do that."

259
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:10,776
I don't.

260
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:14,717
It's the Paramchaitanya, which works it.

261
00:28:14,717 --> 00:28:16,697
In the same way, it will work for you also.

262
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:25,526
But you must have faith in yourself and absolute
faith in Sahaja Yoga.

263
00:28:25,526 --> 00:28:26,526
Absolute.

264
00:28:26,526 --> 00:28:39,847
That's the only way we can achieve this, that
many, many, many people, most of the people

265
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:44,666
of the world – I wouldn't say all of them
rather difficult to say that, but may be possible

266
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:49,557
– should enter into the Kingdom of God with
us.

267
00:28:49,557 --> 00:28:54,597
That's the most important thing, more than
all these worldly things and more than all

268
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:56,387
these nonsensical things.

269
00:28:56,387 --> 00:29:02,896
So the attention should be, "How many people

270
00:29:02,896 --> 00:29:12,857
we are going to bring to Sahaj Yog, how many
we are going to save, what are we going to

271
00:29:12,857 --> 00:29:16,647
do about it?"

272
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:24,097
When you have to think about it every morning,
how can you remember the time and date?

273
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:31,787
When you are in emergency now, and you know
that this emergency has to be fulfilled, then

274
00:29:31,787 --> 00:29:41,937
how can you just pay attention to all worldly
things, all worldly achievements?

275
00:29:41,937 --> 00:29:44,317
That will take its own course.

276
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:46,387
You don't have to worry.

277
00:29:46,387 --> 00:29:48,597
That works out automatic, automatically.

278
00:29:48,597 --> 00:29:57,557
Only thing where you really need your own
diversion, or your own focusing, is Sahaja

279
00:29:57,557 --> 00:29:59,947
Yoga, in and out.

280
00:29:59,947 --> 00:30:06,656
If we really want peace on this Earth, if
we want really progress for ourselves, if

281
00:30:06,656 --> 00:30:12,507
we want all kinds of physical, mental and
emotional problems being solved, all for our

282
00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:21,247
good, why not we come to Sahaj Yoga, where
we don't have to do anything except for raising

283
00:30:21,247 --> 00:30:31,827
our kundalini, except for meditating for it
for very little time and to achieve that state

284
00:30:31,827 --> 00:30:35,147
of joy.

285
00:30:35,147 --> 00:30:40,776
Today My feelings are really full of joy,

286
00:30:40,776 --> 00:30:51,747
full of joy, because now I can see how things
are happening, how one person can produce

287
00:30:51,747 --> 00:30:55,997
thousands and thousands of Sahaja yogis.

288
00:30:55,997 --> 00:31:03,737
I saw one miracle, I told once that one seed
has all the thousand trees it is going to

289
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:13,497
produce and when I saw a new technique of
tissue culture, I was amazed that on one little

290
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:22,187
seed there were so many little, little primules
who had come out.

291
00:31:22,187 --> 00:31:29,567
In the same way, you are all capable, and
you all can do it, but what is needed is faith

292
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:36,276
in yourself and also complete sincerity about
Sahaja Yoga.

293
00:31:36,276 --> 00:31:41,507
If that happens today, you have really celebrated
My birthday.

294
00:31:41,507 --> 00:31:51,687
If you think that My birthday's important,
that for Me very important is that everybody

295
00:31:51,687 --> 00:31:53,266
gets their spiritual birthday.

296
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:56,139
May God bless you.
