1
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:18,167
Every year we have birthdays of various people,

2
00:00:18,297 --> 00:00:25,437
and every year we make a vow that this year

3
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:32,457
I will not do this or I will not do that.

4
00:00:34,694 --> 00:00:44,707
This is a very good way of seeing how far we have come in life.

5
00:00:48,864 --> 00:01:03,691
Many people who really have achieved 
a very great height in their spiritual life

6
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:13,562
did not need a birthday, but every day they felt it's a birthday

7
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:26,698
to start, to go ahead, to understand, to learn.

8
00:01:28,408 --> 00:01:33,948
Every day is a new year for them.

9
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:45,696
In our own life we see that our surroundings

10
00:01:45,826 --> 00:01:50,725
change very slowly.

11
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:56,983
Sometimes it is shocking; sometimes you are surprised

12
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:02,040
how the surroundings are not changing.

13
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:12,984
But, in a subtle way, there is a tremendous change

14
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:18,820
that is happening within us and without.

15
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:27,930
The whole atmosphere today is governed by human beings.

16
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:37,749
I don't know how far Paramachaitanya works it out,

17
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:47,210
but it is for us to open ourselves to new dimensions in our lives.

18
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:57,944
For example, if we find we still have – through our introspection –

19
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:03,370
we locate that we have these old, subtle, nonsensical things

20
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,042
still hanging around us,

21
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:11,336
we don't have to vow for it.

22
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:22,405
You have to just witness it, and the destructive path it is taking you to, 

23
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,376
immediately you will give up.

24
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:32,709
You don't have to worry as to put a vow upon yourself,

25
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:48,558
because now you are" samartha", meaning
now you are absolutely empowered:

26
00:03:49,895 --> 00:04:00,749
whatever you think is wrong, your attention
itself on it will slowly, gradually

27
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:16,519
remove the doubts about having those problems, those

28
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:27,466
connections, conditions and ego that are lingering still, 

29
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:31,806
definitely you will drop them.

30
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:39,176
With your attention, it will run away.

31
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:49,322
Then you will realize that every day your attention is getting purified,

32
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:55,656
getting powerful, getting compassionate.

33
00:04:56,868 --> 00:05:06,642
Normally, whatever reaction you have in your attention just disappears,

34
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:12,734
 and you start witnessing the whole thing,

35
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:24,162
and your power of attention, through that witnessing force, acts

36
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:26,996
and it works.

37
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:37,756
It works not only on you, but on everything that surrounds you.

38
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:42,656
Firstly, through your meditation,

39
00:05:42,786 --> 00:05:51,216
in that state of meditation, you expand within yourself.

40
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:54,989
You stay in the present.

41
00:05:55,646 --> 00:06:00,166
The other day, somebody asked Me, "Where was your last birthday?"

42
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:05,846
I just forgot where it was.

43
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:11,546
Otherwise my memory is very good, like an elephant.

44
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:15,689
But this I forgot.

45
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:28,572
Perhaps, every time, every day, you live in the 
present, and you grow.

46
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:38,891
So, you forget when and where this growth has taken place.

47
00:06:40,226 --> 00:06:47,370
My own growth has been like this,

48
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:55,463
that every time I go to a place,

49
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:06,869
I find very nice new people coming in

50
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:14,819
and some of the horrible ones from the old lot disappearing.

51
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:22,468
It's something like, when the tree grows,

52
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:29,507
the leaves go on falling and new leaves start coming.

53
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:40,304
But in Sahaja Yoga, it's something different
I find, that on the tree of Sahaja Yoga

54
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:51,176
very few, very, very few leaves fall off,

55
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:59,256
and you sometimes face a lush garden of beautiful people.

56
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:12,276
To me, it's like a miraculous fireworks.

57
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:24,816
It starts like a small line and then opens up into several beautiful patterns.

58
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:33,899
It is impossible to envisage or to visualize what will happen to us,

59
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:43,582
to Sahaja Yoga and to all of you.

60
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:52,572
I have never learned to imagine things,

61
00:08:52,702 --> 00:09:02,965
but the vision that you see is really remarkable, is very remarkable,

62
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:12,980
that I see all Sahaja Yogis drenched in divine love

63
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:32,793
and expressing themselves in a very beautiful and very deep manner.

64
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:45,836
This, when comes in, that really makes your attention absolutely enwrapped 

65
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:53,506
in such divine bliss that you forget that moment.

66
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:59,896
One of those moments are when you celebrate my birthday.

67
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:07,146
I even forget how many years I have lived on this Earth.

68
00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:15,277
Sometimes I say, "I am seventy-three", sometimes 
I say, "I am seventy" – I just don't know.

69
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:24,199
Because, as I told you, it does not leave any mark of time,

70
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:31,949
of date, of years, in that blissful state.

71
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,645
As if sometimes you can think that you went to see

72
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:43,427
something very beautiful, like Taj Mahal, without knowing what it is,

73
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:52,391
and suddenly you find such a beautiful building, unexpectedly.

74
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:59,466
You just get blindfolded, as they say. In Hindi,
say "avakka" [speechless]

75
00:10:59,596 --> 00:11:02,926
You don't know how to express.

76
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:06,296
You become speechless.

77
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:13,386
And invariably you'll find, that time you'll forget the time.

78
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:18,096
You will forget how you came there.

79
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:27,345
All the story behind all that finishes off,
as soon as you see the reality of the vision.

80
00:11:27,475 --> 00:11:40,623
This reality of the vision is something 
beyond even my thinking and imagination.

81
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:54,225
I cannot, even now, sometimes, believe
that there are so many Sahaja Yogis

82
00:11:54,355 --> 00:11:59,519
who have got this subtle knowledge.

83
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:08,326
I never knew that there are so many seekers,
to begin with.

84
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:12,926
I never knew that there are such subtle people on this Earth.

85
00:12:14,238 --> 00:12:26,639
All over the world, wherever I went,
whether I went to Nepal or to Brazil,

86
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:38,026
suddenly I find facing so many beautiful seekers.

87
00:12:38,156 --> 00:12:41,266
If you ask me, "When did You go to Brazil?"

88
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:43,946
I won't be able to tell you the dates.

89
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:49,756
I have a very bad memory for dates for the same reason, I think,

90
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:53,236
because every time I see a vision.

91
00:12:53,366 --> 00:13:01,106
And the time also just stops for that moment.

92
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:05,466
It doesn't express itself.

93
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:10,826
Nothing is recorded, except for the experience.

94
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:18,656
And this experience is in an abstract form.

95
00:13:18,786 --> 00:13:22,196
You cannot describe.

96
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:31,116
It is beyond words and beyond any description.

97
00:13:33,697 --> 00:13:41,910
At that time, you really become thoughtless,

98
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:49,246
and that is the time we have to really enjoy.

99
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:57,646
The greatest curse of modern times is the watch, all the time that we'll keep.

100
00:13:57,776 --> 00:14:10,641
And all the time we are just seeing the time, what time it is now,

101
00:14:10,771 --> 00:14:18,306
and after two seconds again also you want to see what is the time.

102
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:23,266
We have crossed the limits of time: "kalatit".

103
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:29,926
Try to understand why we have crossed, because time moves according to us.

104
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,366
You can experience it.

105
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:39,120
The other day, I was coming from Delhi,

106
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,357
and in my household, everybody seems to be very particular about time.

107
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:50,213
So, they were after my life, "Come along, 
come along. Getting late, getting late.

108
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:54,119
Now, you can't just get into the plane", this, that.

109
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,096
All right.

110
00:14:57,226 --> 00:15:01,316
And when I reached there, they said that, "The
plane is still waiting.

111
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:05,116
It's not, it's not necessary for you to hurry up.

112
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:10,566
It will take at least fifteen, twenty minutes for you to go."

113
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:17,177
So, also this name of "airport" makes people really jumpy, I should say.

114
00:15:17,308 --> 00:15:26,416
They have to go to the aeroplane means as if 
some war is there or I don't know what it is.

115
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:32,846
So far, luckily, I have never missed a plane,
never missed a train in my lifetime.

116
00:15:32,976 --> 00:15:37,136
Though I travel, I think, quite a lot.

117
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:46,975
I have every time found, invariably, that the plane itself is waiting for me.

118
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:48,766
It won't leave.

119
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:56,303
Like, I'll give you a very interesting example today, if you are relaxed.

120
00:15:56,446 --> 00:16:16,845
We were in Prague, and we were supposed to go 
to Poland via – again same thing happens

121
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:21,626
to me with experience I had – via Vienna.

122
00:16:21,756 --> 00:16:25,620
And we had a very great Sahaja Yogi with us

123
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,366
who told me that the plane will be leaving at eleven o'clock.

124
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:35,389
And from the airport, he rings me up, "No, the plane is leaving at 9:30."

125
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:41,466
If I want, I can be ready in five minutes or I can take two hours, depends on.

126
00:16:41,596 --> 00:16:45,474
So, I was ready. I just jumped into the car. We reached the airport,

127
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:52,134
but we were late by fifteen minutes,
and the ground lady started shouting at me

128
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:57,977
at the top of her voice, "You people, 
you are VIPs, you are this, you are that."

129
00:16:57,977 --> 00:17:00,137
All kinds of things she said to me.

130
00:17:01,196 --> 00:17:04,535
And this Sahaja Yogi could not bear it.

131
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:09,343
And he felt that it was his mistake – he told Me a wrong time,

132
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:13,585
 “That's why this lady is shouting at my Mother.”

133
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:17,630
He couldn't bear it. He was very unhappy.

134
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:34,601
So, we went into the aeroplane

135
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:40,875
with this lady shouting behind, and we saw that the pilot

136
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:46,953
and engineers, they were busy with some correction of the machinery.

137
00:17:47,084 --> 00:17:49,996
They said, "It is little bit out of order. It will be ready."

138
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:51,695
So, we sat down.

139
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:55,590
Now this Sahaja Yogi could not bear it,

140
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,152
and his tears started rolling down his eyes.

141
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:04,936
The another Sahaj Yogini, she said, “Brother, it's all right. Don't cry."

142
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:08,559
They were sitting behind me. I just turned round.

143
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:11,756
I said, "It's all right. Don't worry."

144
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:17,647
He said, "No Mother, because of me she could 
say all these things, you know. I can't bear it."

145
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:20,654
And he couldn't stop crying.

146
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:28,970
Within one minute, the sky which was absolutely open

147
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,609
was covered with big clouds like huge, big elephants

148
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:39,509
walking into the whole area – very big.

149
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,655
All the Sahaja Yogis who were standing also

150
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:49,978
– on the other side, on top of the airport – saw it happening.

151
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:54,335
The whole thing became absolutely jet-black.

152
00:18:54,466 --> 00:19:00,246
"Oh, My God," I said. "See, the tears of this gentleman has such powers."

153
00:19:00,376 --> 00:19:04,599
And then the airport people told us that this plane is out of order,

154
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:08,655
so we have to get down. So, we got down.

155
00:19:08,786 --> 00:19:12,085
We came back.

156
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:16,929
Then he went to this ground hostess and told her,

157
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:20,036
"Now, whom should we shout at?

158
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,426
Now the plane is not going, should we shout at you?

159
00:19:23,556 --> 00:19:27,286
How dare you shout at my Mother and all those
things you said?"

160
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:34,212
But all the people there, at the airport,

161
00:19:34,212 --> 00:19:41,688
who were still in-  
under the same regime style, got such a fright.

162
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:44,827
The manager himself walked to Me. He said:

163
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:49,566
"For your plane, there's still five hours and if you want out we can give you

164
00:19:49,696 --> 00:19:51,526
permission, all of you can go out."

165
00:19:51,656 --> 00:19:54,005
And he took Me by a special way.

166
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:57,436
I couldn't understand this reaction though.

167
00:19:57,566 --> 00:20:01,219
So, I went out and we did some shopping or something,

168
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:04,696
and when we came back we were surprised.

169
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:11,726
All the airport was rather stunned by us 
and when I walked – that was the only plane

170
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:17,156
that was leaving – all the traffic had stopped except for this plane.

171
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:26,776
And when we walked down to board the plane,
the gentleman who was there said,

172
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:29,950
"Mother, can you help me?"
I said, "How?"

173
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:31,906
"I have got a terrible back pain."

174
00:20:32,036 --> 00:20:34,576
I said, "How can I do it?"

175
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:40,019
Then one lady walked in to say, "Mother, 
please, I have pain in my shoulder.

176
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,826
Can you put your hand on that?"

177
00:20:42,956 --> 00:20:46,846
I just put my hand on her shoulder and 
she said, "I am feeling all right."

178
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:49,556
She started lifting her arm.

179
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:56,988
Then I went – I thought I'd better now take to the aeroplane –

180
00:20:57,118 --> 00:20:59,932
when I was walking, the same gentleman came to me.

181
00:21:00,063 --> 00:21:02,156
He said, "Why not put hand on my back?"

182
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:05,065
I said, "I have to board the plane."

183
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:08,436
He said, "I'll walk with You. You just put your hand on my back.

184
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:10,086
I'm sure I'll be all right."

185
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:13,106
And we walked together about two minutes or so.

186
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:16,076
He said, "I'm all right."

187
00:21:16,206 --> 00:21:19,126
The whole atmosphere changed.

188
00:21:20,268 --> 00:21:25,864
It was such a tremendous effect on these people
who have been under a regime 

189
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:31,026
and have been really military-like, and the whole treatment was so funny.

190
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:38,102
The whole thing changed in such a short time,

191
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:46,422
and I was amazed how the tears of this Sahaja Yogi has worked this wonder.

192
00:21:46,553 --> 00:21:52,658
Now, imagine a moment when tears started rolling his eyes,

193
00:21:52,788 --> 00:21:57,563
that moment just manifested a big
drama.

194
00:21:57,694 --> 00:22:02,266
And, ultimately, what you find is

195
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:09,268
that the people at the airport became extremely humble

196
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:13,003
and respectful.

197
00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:22,834
So, when we start thinking of time and time and time,

198
00:22:24,474 --> 00:22:28,953
we have to understand that time is our slave.

199
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:31,897
We are not slaves of the time.

200
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:37,695
There are thousand and one stories I can tell you how,

201
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:45,472
by delaying in a place, by getting late in a place, by not caring for the time,

202
00:22:45,602 --> 00:22:49,201
I have seen such beautiful manifestations,

203
00:22:49,332 --> 00:22:57,349
such beautiful dramas – the art of the divine Power –

204
00:22:57,479 --> 00:23:05,375
that I was amazed how people worry so much about the time.

205
00:23:05,505 --> 00:23:16,657
If time is really necessary, if we are all watching our time every year,

206
00:23:16,787 --> 00:23:25,158
as our birthday, and if you think that
time is very important- it is in a way.

207
00:23:25,288 --> 00:23:33,986
In these modern times, we really need the
time for meditation, for collective meetings

208
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:38,776
and for Sahaja Yoga.

209
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:45,833
I know when there was the war of independence in this country,

210
00:23:45,963 --> 00:23:53,766
where my parents fought with all their "tana", "mana", "dhana" [body, mind, wealth],

211
00:23:53,896 --> 00:24:00,195
that time I remember how they never cared for anything.

212
00:24:00,326 --> 00:24:06,072
They went all out, because it was very important

213
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:13,456
to get this country freed from the clutches of the Empire.

214
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:20,453
And this was so important.

215
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:25,188
They had to meet somebody at such a point: that man, supposing,

216
00:24:25,318 --> 00:24:29,777
is escaping from the jail, or there's some sort of a thing on,

217
00:24:29,907 --> 00:24:33,274
they could not afford to miss the time.

218
00:24:33,404 --> 00:24:39,169
They could not afford to just neglect that important time,

219
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,653
important meeting, important discussion,

220
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:46,651
because everything had become an emergency.

221
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:52,891
For them, nobody told them, nobody gave 
them lectures, but for them, from inside.

222
00:24:53,021 --> 00:25:00,585
They were all legendary people, I should say,
the way they fought for their freedom.

223
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:04,639
This is today the same situation.

224
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:09,629
It is an emergency, a very subtle emergency

225
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,857
that nothing is more important than spreading Sahaja Yoga.

226
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:23,253
If some people will miss it, will not know about it,

227
00:25:23,383 --> 00:25:26,795
we will be responsible for that.

228
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:31,661
At the time of Christ, Buddha, Mahavira or any one of them,

229
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:35,362
there were no aeroplanes to travel.

230
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:39,026
There were not these loudspeakers,

231
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:44,972
also other communications and televisions and all those things.

232
00:25:45,102 --> 00:25:49,832
All these things have come now.

233
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:52,812
That has been manifested now.

234
00:25:52,942 --> 00:26:01,988
It is the work of Paramachaitanya.

235
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:12,123
Through scientists, through other knowledge, 
all this manifestation has taken place.

236
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:18,292
Also, these people didn't have to face people,
so many, nor did they, were supposed

237
00:26:18,422 --> 00:26:22,922
to give Realization to people in such a big number.

238
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:38,316
So, all these inventions, all that you see
today as modern ventures which we have got,

239
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:42,881
they are all for Sahaja Yoga.

240
00:26:43,096 --> 00:26:50,671
Without Sahaja Yoga, you cannot imagine 
what would happen to this world.

241
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:58,500
The first and foremost thing is: we have no
peace within our hearts.

242
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:02,873
We talk of peace. I know of people, who have got awards in peace,

243
00:27:03,003 --> 00:27:07,137
have no peace within their heart, no peace
at all.

244
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:15,587
Unless and until we human beings have peace,
there cannot be peace in the whole world.

245
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,139
It is we who create wars.

246
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,707
It is we who do all kinds of violence.

247
00:27:21,837 --> 00:27:31,517
It is we, we ruin the possibility of people
getting into the Kingdom of God.

248
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:43,437
So, peace can be only achieved by establishing
peace in the hearts of the people.

249
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:52,556
And that is only possible, that you achieve
the state of thoughtless awareness.

250
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:55,587
You remain in the present.

251
00:27:55,717 --> 00:28:04,477
And there, where you'll be amazed, you will
be standing like a rock, because you will

252
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:06,957
have reality in your hand.

253
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:09,529
You can work out the way you like.

254
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,517
Actually, I don't work out anything whatsoever, really.

255
00:28:13,647 --> 00:28:17,353
You may say, "You do this and You do that."
I don't.

256
00:28:17,484 --> 00:28:20,357
It's the Paramchaitanya which works it.

257
00:28:20,487 --> 00:28:24,400
In the same way, it will work for you also.

258
00:28:24,531 --> 00:28:31,165
But you must have faith in yourself and absolute faith in Sahaja Yoga.

259
00:28:31,296 --> 00:28:33,144
Absolute.

260
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:44,134
That's the only way we can achieve
this, that many, many, many people,

261
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,543
most of the people of the world

262
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:51,878
– I wouldn't say all of them rather
difficult to say that, but may be possible –

263
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:55,298
should enter into the Kingdom of God with us.

264
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:59,748
That's the most important thing, more than all these worldly things

265
00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:03,813
and more than all these nonsensical things.

266
00:29:05,095 --> 00:29:09,225
So, the attention should be, "How many people

267
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:17,763
we are going to bring to Sahaj Yoga? How many we are going to save?

268
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:23,230
What are we going to do about it?"

269
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:30,715
When you have to think about it every morning,
how can you remember the time and date?

270
00:29:30,846 --> 00:29:33,429
When you are in emergency now,

271
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:37,309
and you know that this emergency has to be fulfilled,

272
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:47,577
then how can you just pay attention to all 
worldly things, all worldly achievements?

273
00:29:47,707 --> 00:29:49,957
That will take its own course.

274
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:52,027
You don't have to worry.

275
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,765
That works out automatic- automatically.

276
00:29:55,896 --> 00:30:02,713
Only thing where you really need your own diversion or your own focusing,

277
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:06,667
is Sahaja Yoga, in and out.

278
00:30:06,797 --> 00:30:12,296
If we really want peace on this Earth, if
we want really progress for ourselves,

279
00:30:12,426 --> 00:30:17,183
if we want all kinds of physical, mental and
emotional problems being solved,

280
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:22,760
all for our good, why not we come to Sahaja
Yoga? Where we don't have to do anything

281
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:29,233
except for raising our kundalini,

282
00:30:29,363 --> 00:30:34,096
except for meditating for it, for very little 
time,

283
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:40,787
and to achieve that state of joy.

284
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:49,099
Today, my feelings are really full of joy, full of joy,

285
00:30:49,229 --> 00:30:57,661
because now I can see how things are
happening, how one person can produce

286
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:02,595
thousands and thousands of Sahaja Yogis.

287
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:08,847
I saw one miracle, I told once that, "One
seed has all the thousand trees

288
00:31:08,978 --> 00:31:16,733
it is going to produce". And when I saw a new technique of tissue culture,

289
00:31:16,863 --> 00:31:20,095
I was amazed that on one little seed

290
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:27,871
there were so many little, little primules who had come out.

291
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:33,530
In the same way, you are all capable, and you all can do it,

292
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:41,999
but what is needed is faith in yourself and
also complete sincerity about Sahaja Yoga.

293
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:48,078
If that happens today, you have really celebrated
my birthday.

294
00:31:48,209 --> 00:31:56,848
If you think that my birthday is important,
that for Me very important is that

295
00:31:56,979 --> 00:32:00,000
everybody gets their spiritual birthday.

296
00:32:00,547 --> 00:32:02,632
 May God bless you.
