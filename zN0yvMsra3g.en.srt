00:00:00,095 --> 00:00:02,055
Birthday Puja Calcutta, India 21 March 1994

2
00:00:02,176 --> 00:00:12,177
Every year we have birthdays of various people,

3
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:19,447
and every year we make a vow that this year

4
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:28,573
I will not do this or I will not do that.

5
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:38,717
This is a very good way of seeing how far we have come in life.

6
00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:58,568
Many people who really have achieved 
a very great height in their spiritual life

7
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:07,882
did not need a birthday, but every day they felt it's a birthday

8
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:22,257
to start, to go ahead, to understand, to learn.

9
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:28,918
Every day is a new year for them.

10
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:39,706
In our own life we see that our surroundings

11
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:44,735
change very slowly.

12
00:01:44,862 --> 00:01:50,993
Sometimes it is shocking; sometimes you are surprised

13
00:01:51,117 --> 00:01:56,050
how the surroundings are not changing.

14
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:06,994
But, in a subtle way, there is a tremendous change

15
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:12,830
that is happening within us and without.

16
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:21,940
The whole atmosphere today is governed by human beings.

17
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:31,759
I don't know how far Paramachaitanya works it out,

18
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:41,220
but it is for us to open ourselves to new dimensions in our lives.

19
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:51,954
For example, if we find we still have – through our introspection –

20
00:02:52,074 --> 00:03:02,052
we locate that we have these old, subtle, 
nonsensical things still hanging around us,

21
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:05,346
we don't have to vow for it.

22
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:16,415
You have to just witness it, and the destructive path it is taking you to.

23
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:20,386
Immediately you will give up.

24
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:26,719
You don't have to worry as to put a vow upon yourself,

25
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:42,568
because now you are samarth, meaning
now you are absolutely empowered.

26
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:54,759
Whatever you think is wrong, your attention
itself on it will slowly, gradually

27
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:10,529
remove the doubts about having those problems, those

28
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:21,476
connections, conditions and ego that are lingering still.

29
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:25,816
Definitely you will drop them.

30
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:33,186
With your attention, it will run away.

31
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:43,332
Then you will realize that every
day your attention is getting purified,

32
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:49,666
getting powerful, getting compassionate.

33
00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:58,880
Normally, whatever reaction you have in your attention

34
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,744
just disappears, and you start witnessing the whole thing,

35
00:05:06,864 --> 00:05:18,172
and your power of attention, through that witnessing force, acts

36
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:21,006
and it works.

37
00:05:21,126 --> 00:05:31,766
It works not only on you, but on everything that surrounds you.

38
00:05:31,886 --> 00:05:36,666
Firstly, through your meditation,

39
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:45,226
in that state of meditation, you expand within yourself.

40
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:49,526
You stay in the present.

41
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:54,176
The other day, somebody asked Me, "Where was Your last birthday?"

42
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:59,856
I just forgot where it was.

43
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:05,556
Otherwise My memory is very good, like an elephant.

44
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:09,699
But this I forgot.

45
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:26,365
Perhaps, every time, every day, you live in the 
present, and you grow, so you forget

46
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:34,106
when and where this growth has taken place.

47
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:41,380
My own growth has been like this,

48
00:06:41,500 --> 00:07:00,879
that every time I go to a place, I
find very nice new people coming in

49
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:08,829
and some of the horrible ones from the old lot disappearing.

50
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:16,478
It's something like, when the tree grows,

51
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:23,517
the leaves go on falling and new leaves start coming.

52
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:34,314
But in Sahaja Yoga, it's something different
I find, that on the tree of Sahaj Yoga

53
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:45,186
very few, very, very few leaves fall off,

54
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:53,266
and you sometimes face a lush garden of beautiful people.

55
00:07:55,875 --> 00:08:06,286
To Me, it's like a miraculous fireworks.

56
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:18,826
It starts like a small line and then opens up into several beautiful patterns.

57
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:27,909
It is impossible to envisage or to visualize what will happen to us,

58
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:39,606
to Sahaj Yog and to all of you.

59
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:46,582
I have never learned to imagine things,

60
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:56,975
but the vision that you see is really remarkable, is very remarkable,

61
00:08:57,095 --> 00:09:07,950
that I see all Sahaja yogis drenched in divine love

62
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:26,276
and expressing themselves in a very beautiful and very deep manner.

63
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:37,368
This, when comes in, that really makes your attention absolutely

64
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:47,516
enwrapped in such divine bliss that you forget that moment.

65
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:53,906
One of those moments are when you celebrate My Birthday.

66
00:09:54,026 --> 00:10:01,156
I even forget how many years I have lived on this Earth.

67
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:09,287
Sometimes I say I am seventy-three, sometimes 
I say I am seventy – I just don't know.

68
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:18,209
Because, as I told you, it does not leave any mark of time,

69
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:25,959
of date, of years, in that blissful state.

70
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,655
As if sometimes you can think that you went to see

71
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:37,437
something very beautiful, like Taj Mahal, without knowing what it is,

72
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:46,401
and suddenly you find such a beautiful building, unexpectedly.

73
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:53,476
You just get blindfolded, as they say.
In Hindi, say awak.

74
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:56,936
You don't know how to express.

75
00:10:57,057 --> 00:11:00,306
You become speechless.

76
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:07,396
And invariably you'll find, that time you'll forget the time.

77
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:12,106
You will forget how you came there.

78
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:21,355
All the story behind all that finishes off
as soon as you see the reality of the vision.

79
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:29,026
This reality of the vision is something beyond

80
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:37,296
even My thinking and imagination.

81
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:48,235
I cannot, even now, sometimes, believe
that there are so many Sahaja yogis

82
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:53,529
who have got
this subtle knowledge.

83
00:11:55,536 --> 00:12:02,336
I never knew that there are so many seekers,
to begin with.

84
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:06,936
I never knew that there are such subtle people on this Earth.

85
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:21,145
All over the world, wherever I went,
whether I went to Nepal or to Brazil,

86
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:32,036
suddenly I find facing so many beautiful seekers.

87
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:35,276
If you ask Me, "When did You go to Brazil?"

88
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:37,956
I won't be able to tell you the dates.

89
00:12:38,076 --> 00:12:43,766
I have very bad memory for dates for the same reason, I think,

90
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:47,246
because every time I see a vision.

91
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:55,116
And the time also just stops for that moment.

92
00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:59,476
It doesn't express itself.

93
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:04,836
Nothing is recorded, except for the experience.

94
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:12,666
And this experience is in an abstract form.

95
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:16,206
You cannot describe.

96
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:25,126
It is beyond words and beyond any description.

97
00:13:27,697 --> 00:13:35,920
At that time you really become thoughtless,

98
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:43,256
and that is the time we have to really enjoy.

99
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:51,656
The greatest curse of modern times is the watch, all the time that we keep.

100
00:13:51,776 --> 00:14:04,651
And all the time we are just seeing the time, what time it is now,

101
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:12,316
and after two seconds again also you want to see what is the time.

102
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:17,276
We have crossed the limits of time – kalatit.

103
00:14:17,396 --> 00:14:23,936
Try to understand why we have crossed, because time moves according to us.

104
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,376
You can experience it.

105
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:37,446
The other day I was coming from Delhi, and
in My household everybody seems to be very

106
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:39,708
particular about time.

107
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:44,223
So they were after My life, "Come along, 
come along. Getting late, getting late.

108
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:48,129
Now, you can't just get into the plane," this, that.

109
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,106
All right.

110
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:55,326
And when I reached there, they said that "The
plane is still waiting.

111
00:14:55,446 --> 00:14:59,126
It's not … it's not necessary for you to
hurry up.

112
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:04,576
It will take at least fifteen, twenty minutes for you to go."

113
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:11,187
So, also this name of "airport" makes people really jumpy, I should say.

114
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:20,426
They have to go to the aeroplane means as if 
some war is there or I don't know what it is.

115
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:26,856
So far, luckily, I have never missed a plane,
never missed a train in My lifetime.

116
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:31,146
Though I travel, I think, quite a lot.

117
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:40,985
I have every time found, invariably, that the plane itself is waiting for Me.

118
00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:42,776
It won't leave.

119
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:50,313
Like, I'll give you a very interesting example today, if you are relaxed.

120
00:15:50,446 --> 00:16:10,855
We were in Prague, and we were supposed to go 
to Poland via – again same thing happens

121
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:15,636
to Me with experience I had – via Vienna.

122
00:16:15,756 --> 00:16:19,630
And we had a very great Sahaja yogi with us

123
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,376
who told Me that the plane will be leaving at eleven o'clock.

124
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:28,600
And from the airport he rings Me up, "No, the plane is leaving at 9:30."

125
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:35,476
If I want, I can be ready in five minutes or I can take two hours, depends on.

126
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:39,484
So I was ready. I just jumped into the car. We reached the airport,

127
00:16:39,604 --> 00:16:46,144
but we were late by fifteen minutes,
and the ground lady started shouting at Me

128
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:52,786
at the top of her voice, "You people, 
you are VIPs, you are this, you are that."

129
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:55,076
All kinds of things she said to Me.

130
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:58,545
And this Sahaja yogi could not bear it.

131
00:16:58,665 --> 00:17:03,353
And he felt that it was his mistake – he told Me a wrong time,

132
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:07,595
 “That's why this lady is shouting at my Mother.”

133
00:17:07,716 --> 00:17:11,640
He couldn't bear it. He was very unhappy.

134
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:28,611
So, we went into the aeroplane

135
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:34,885
with this lady shouting behind, and we saw that the pilot

136
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:40,963
and engineers, they were busy with some correction of the machinery.

137
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:44,006
They said, "It is little bit out of order. It will be ready."

138
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:45,705
So we sat down.

139
00:17:45,826 --> 00:17:49,600
Now this Sahaja yogi could not bear it,

140
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,162
and his tears started rolling down his eyes.

141
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:58,946
The another Sahaj yogini, she said, “Brother, it's all right. Don't cry."

142
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:02,569
They were sitting behind Me. I just turned round.

143
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:05,766
I said, "It's all right. Don't worry."

144
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:11,657
He said, "No Mother, because of me she could 
say all these things, you know. I can't bear it."

145
00:18:11,778 --> 00:18:14,664
And he couldn't stop crying.

146
00:18:14,785 --> 00:18:22,980
Within one minute, the sky which was absolutely open

147
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:28,619
was covered with big clouds like huge, big elephants

148
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:33,519
walking into the whole area – very big.

149
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,665
All the Sahaja yogis who were standing also

150
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:43,988
– on the other side, on top of the airport – saw it happening.

151
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:48,345
The whole thing became absolutely jet-black.

152
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:54,256
"Oh, My God," I said. "See, the tears of this gentleman has such powers."

153
00:18:54,376 --> 00:18:58,609
And then the airport people told us that this plane is out of order,

154
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:02,665
so we have to get down. So we got down.

155
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:06,095
We came back.

156
00:19:06,216 --> 00:19:10,939
Then he went to this ground hostess and told her,

157
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:14,046
"Now, whom should we shout at?

158
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,436
Now the plane is not going, should we shout
at you?

159
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:21,296
How dare you shout at my Mother and all those
things you said?"

160
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:32,786
But all the people there at the airport, who were
still in … under the same regime style,

161
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,706
got such a fright.

162
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:38,837
The manager himself walked to Me. He said:

163
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:43,576
"For your plane, there's still five hours and if you want out we can give you

164
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:45,536
permission, all of you can go out."

165
00:19:45,656 --> 00:19:48,015
And he took Me by a special way.

166
00:19:48,135 --> 00:19:51,446
I couldn't understand this reaction.

167
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:55,229
So I went out and we did some shopping or something,

168
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:58,706
and when we came back we were surprised.

169
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:05,736
All the airport was rather stunned by us 
and when I walked – that was the only plane

170
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:11,166
that was leaving – all the traffic had stopped except for this plane.

171
00:20:11,286 --> 00:20:20,786
And when we walked down to board the plane,
the gentleman who was there said,

172
00:20:20,906 --> 00:20:23,960
"Mother, can you help me?"
I said, "How?"

173
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:25,916
"I have got a terrible back pain."

174
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:28,586
I said, "How can I do it?"

175
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:34,029
Then one lady walked in to say, "Mother, 
please, I have pain in my shoulder.

176
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,836
Can you put your hand on that?"

177
00:20:36,956 --> 00:20:40,856
I just put My hand on her shoulder and 
she said, "I am feeling all right."

178
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:43,566
She started lifting her arm.

179
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:50,998
Then I went – I thought I'd better now take to the aeroplane –

180
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:53,942
when I was walking, the same gentleman came to Me.

181
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:56,166
He said, "Why not put hand on my back?"

182
00:20:56,286 --> 00:20:59,075
I said, "I have to board the plane."

183
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:02,446
He said, "I'll walk with You. You just put your hand on my back.

184
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:04,096
I'm sure I'll be all right."

185
00:21:04,216 --> 00:21:07,116
And we walked together about two minutes or
so.

186
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:10,086
He said, "I'm all right."

187
00:21:10,206 --> 00:21:13,136
The whole atmosphere changed.

188
00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:20,586
It was such a tremendous effect on these people
who have been under a regime and have been

189
00:21:20,706 --> 00:21:25,036
really military-like, and the whole treatment was so funny.

190
00:21:25,156 --> 00:21:32,112
The whole thing changed in such a short time,

191
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:40,432
and I was amazed how the tears of this Sahaja yogi has worked this wonder.

192
00:21:40,553 --> 00:21:46,668
Now, imagine a moment when tears started rolling his eyes,

193
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:51,573
that moment just manifested a big
drama.

194
00:21:51,694 --> 00:21:56,276
And, ultimately, what you find is

195
00:21:56,396 --> 00:22:03,278
that the people at the airport became extremely humble

196
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:07,013
and respectful.

197
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:15,326
So when we start thinking of time and time and time,

198
00:22:18,474 --> 00:22:22,963
we have to understand that time is our slave.

199
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:25,907
We are not slaves of the time.

200
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:31,705
There are thousand and one stories I can tell you how,

201
00:22:31,825 --> 00:22:39,482
by delaying in a place, by getting late in a place, by not caring for the time,

202
00:22:39,602 --> 00:22:43,211
I have seen such beautiful manifestations,

203
00:22:43,332 --> 00:22:51,359
such beautiful dramas – the art of the divine power –

204
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:59,385
that I was amazed how people worry so much about the time.

205
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:10,667
If time is really necessary, if we are all watching our time every year,

206
00:23:10,787 --> 00:23:19,168
as our birthday, and if you think that
time is very important, it is in a way.

207
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:27,996
In these modern times, we really need the
time for meditation, for collective meetings

208
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:32,786
and for Sahaja Yoga.

209
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:39,843
I know when there was the war of independence in this country,

210
00:23:39,963 --> 00:23:47,776
where My parents fought with all their tana, mana, dhana [body, mind, wealth],

211
00:23:47,896 --> 00:23:54,205
that time I remember how they never cared for anything.

212
00:23:54,326 --> 00:24:00,082
They went all out, because it was very important

213
00:24:00,202 --> 00:24:07,466
to get this country freed from the clutches of the Empire.

214
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:14,463
And this was so important.

215
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:19,198
They had to meet somebody at such a point: that man, supposing,

216
00:24:19,318 --> 00:24:23,787
is escaping from the jail, or there's some sort of a thing on,

217
00:24:23,907 --> 00:24:27,284
they could not afford to miss the time.

218
00:24:27,404 --> 00:24:33,179
They could not afford to just neglect that important time,

219
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,663
important meeting, important discussion,

220
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:40,661
because everything had become an emergency.

221
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:46,901
For them, nobody told them, nobody gave 
them lectures, but for them, from inside.

222
00:24:47,021 --> 00:24:54,595
They were all legendary people, I should say,
the way they fought for their freedom.

223
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:58,649
This is, today, the same situation.

224
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:03,639
It is an emergency, a very subtle emergency.

225
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,867
That nothing is more important than spreading Sahaja Yoga.

226
00:25:11,772 --> 00:25:17,263
If some people will miss it, will not know about it,

227
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:20,805
we will be responsible for that.

228
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:25,671
At the time of Christ, Buddha, Mahavira or any one of them,

229
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:29,372
there were no aeroplanes to travel.

230
00:25:29,492 --> 00:25:33,036
There were not these loudspeakers,

231
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:38,982
also other communications and televisions and all those things.

232
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:43,842
All these things have come now.

233
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:46,822
That has been manifested now.

234
00:25:46,942 --> 00:25:55,998
It is the work of Paramachaitanya.

235
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:06,133
Through scientists, through other knowledge, 
all this manifestation have, has taken place.

236
00:26:06,254 --> 00:26:12,302
Also, these people didn't have to face people,
so many, nor did they… were supposed

237
00:26:12,422 --> 00:26:16,932
to give realization to people in such a big number.

238
00:26:17,052 --> 00:26:32,326
So all these inventions, all that you see
today as modern ventures which we have got,

239
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:36,891
they are all for Sahaja Yoga.

240
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:44,681
Without Sahaj Yog, you cannot imagine 
what would happen to this world.

241
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:52,510
The first and foremost thing is we have no
peace within our hearts.

242
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,883
We talk of peace. I know of people, who have got awards in peace,

243
00:26:57,003 --> 00:27:01,147
have no peace within their heart, no peace
at all.

244
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:09,597
Unless and until we human beings have peace,
there cannot be peace in the whole world.

245
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:12,149
It is we who create wars.

246
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:15,717
It is we who do all kinds of violence.

247
00:27:15,837 --> 00:27:25,527
It is we, we ruin the possibility of people
getting into the Kingdom of God.

248
00:27:25,648 --> 00:27:37,447
So, peace can be only achieved by establishing
peace in the hearts of the people.

249
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:46,566
And that is only possible, that you achieve
the state of thoughtless awareness.

250
00:27:46,686 --> 00:27:49,597
You remain in the present.

251
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:58,487
And there, where you'll be amazed, you will
be standing like a rock, because you will

252
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:00,967
have reality in your hand.

253
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:03,539
You can work out the way you like.

254
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,527
Actually, I don't work out anything whatsoever, really.

255
00:28:07,647 --> 00:28:11,363
You may say, "You do this and You do that."
I don't.

256
00:28:11,484 --> 00:28:14,367
It's the Paramchaitanya, which works it.

257
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:18,410
In the same way, it will work for you also.

258
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:25,175
But you must have faith in yourself and absolute faith in Sahaja Yoga.

259
00:28:25,296 --> 00:28:27,154
Absolute.

260
00:28:27,275 --> 00:28:38,144
That's the only way we can achieve
this, that many, many, many people,

261
00:28:38,264 --> 00:28:40,553
most of the people of the world

262
00:28:40,673 --> 00:28:45,888
– I wouldn't say all of them rather
difficult to say that, but may be possible –

263
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:49,308
should enter into the Kingdom of God with
us.

264
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:53,758
That's the most important thing, more than all these worldly things

265
00:28:53,879 --> 00:28:57,823
and more than all these nonsensical things.

266
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:03,235
So the attention should be, "How many people

267
00:29:03,356 --> 00:29:11,773
we are going to bring to Sahaj Yog, how many we are going to save,

268
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:17,240
what are we going to do about it?"

269
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:24,725
When you have to think about it every morning,
how can you remember the time and date?

270
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,439
When you are in emergency now,

271
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:31,319
and you know that this emergency has to be fulfilled,

272
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:41,587
then how can you just pay attention to all 
worldly things, all worldly achievements?

273
00:29:41,707 --> 00:29:43,967
That will take its own course.

274
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:46,037
You don't have to worry.

275
00:29:46,157 --> 00:29:49,775
That works out automatic, automatically.

276
00:29:49,896 --> 00:29:56,723
Only thing where you really need your own diversion, or your own focusing,

277
00:29:56,843 --> 00:30:00,677
is Sahaja Yoga, in and out.

278
00:30:00,797 --> 00:30:06,306
If we really want peace on this Earth, if
we want really progress for ourselves,

279
00:30:06,426 --> 00:30:11,193
if we want all kinds of physical, mental and
emotional problems being solved,

280
00:30:11,314 --> 00:30:16,770
all for our good, why not we come to Sahaj
Yoga, where we don't have to do anything

281
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:23,243
except for raising our kundalini,

282
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:34,797
except for meditating for it for very little 
time and to achieve that state of joy.

283
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:43,109
Today My feelings are really full of joy, full of joy,

284
00:30:43,229 --> 00:30:51,671
because now I can see how things are
happening, how one person can produce

285
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:56,605
thousands and thousands of Sahaja yogis.

286
00:30:56,725 --> 00:31:02,857
I saw one miracle, I told once that
one seed has all the thousand trees

287
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:10,743
it is going to produce and when I saw a new technique of tissue culture,

288
00:31:10,863 --> 00:31:14,105
I was amazed that on one little seed

289
00:31:14,225 --> 00:31:21,881
there were so many little, little primules who had come out.

290
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:27,540
In the same way, you are all capable, and you all can do it,

291
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:36,009
but what is needed is faith in yourself and
also complete sincerity about Sahaja Yoga.

292
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:42,088
If that happens today, you have really celebrated
My birthday.

293
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:50,858
If you think that My birthday's important,
that for Me very important is that

294
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:52,999
everybody gets their spiritual birthday.

295
00:31:54,547 --> 00:31:56,642
 May God bless you.
