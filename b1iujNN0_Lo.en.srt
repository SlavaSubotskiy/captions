1
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:19,258
Today we have assembled here to do the Puja of Vishnumaya.

2
00:00:19,258 --> 00:00:32,509
Vishnumaya is created through human effort, also.

3
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:39,425
As you see the clouds, when they rub against each other,

4
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:49,091
then the electricity is created. So first the clouds have to be created.

5
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:58,799
The sun acts on the sea. See how many chakras come into play.

6
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Sea is the Void, and the sun acts on the sea.

7
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:13,091
Also the moon acts on the sea. As a result of that, clouds are created.

8
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:26,925
This electricity is not created in the ocean -- that would create problems.

9
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:37,925
Is created in the sky so that everybody can see it, can hear it.

10
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:45,050
They see it first and hear it later.

11
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:52,175
It's all well organized, well calculated. That is Vishnumaya.

12
00:01:52,217 --> 00:02:00,883
But it was created, also, with some understanding

13
00:02:00,883 --> 00:02:05,717
by human beings on this earth. First of all they saw

14
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:12,300
the two clouds rubbing each other.

15
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:16,050
So in the primitive stage, human beings

16
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:20,925
tried to rub two material things to create electricity.

17
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:26,258
So two material things, that is two parts of matter,

18
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,509
when rubbed created the electricity. It's very significant to see:

19
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,300
matter can be used to create electricity.

20
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:43,008
The spark of the electricity comes from the matter.

21
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,759
Without matter, they could not have started cooking the food.

22
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:52,634
So how it has helped the Void.

23
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:59,050
First from the ocean, it went into the sky, gave the message to the people

24
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:03,425
to create the electricity. See the love.

25
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:07,175
Then people learned how to cook the food

26
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:19,133
for the digestion to be easier for human beings. How it comes back! From nature,

27
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:21,342
how human beings learn

28
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:34,925
and do it for the good, betterment, hita, of human beings. This benevolent energy,

29
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:41,467
which was meant for the benevolence of human beings, again was utilized.

30
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:46,717
As you see, this is the creation, all this is of Vishnumaya.

31
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:53,091
That's why it's a maya. With electricity you can create a maya,

32
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:57,175
you know that very well, how you can create it. So many are here,

33
00:03:57,175 --> 00:04:01,717
luckily in such a spontaneous way,

34
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:06,800
so many who are dealing with this electricity in creating maya.

35
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:15,550
America is so much helped by this electricity, by Vishnumaya.

36
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,799
You're not thankful to it.

37
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,175
Like you have got Niagara Falls, you have so many falls here.

38
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:27,509
Again, the water when it falls -- it comes from water --

39
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:38,717
when the water falls on the lower level, very lower level, then it moves the turbine

40
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,342
and those movements can create electricity.

41
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:49,759
So you have hydrostatic electricity.

42
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,925
Also the electricity is produced, as you know, through coal.

43
00:04:53,966 --> 00:05:01,799
Now here, again, the Mother Earth works out for the betterment

44
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:10,925
of human beings to create the coal in Her being.

45
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:17,717
I think She must be taking all the baddhas, absorbing all of them in Her stomach,

46
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:22,717
and must be burning the stones inside Her to make the coal.

47
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:28,717
And then that coal is used for making electricity.

48
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:35,383
How much the nature is working for our betterment!

49
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:39,383
Your New York would not have been there but for electricity.

50
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:41,383
It stopped for fifteen minutes

51
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:48,217
and you knew the power of electricity.

52
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:56,509
You cannot move without it. We cannot exist without it. That's why it had to be used and created --

53
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:02,217
given you so much of benevolence. You cook with it; you see with it;

54
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:07,634
you listen with it; you enjoy with it. You wouldn't have your televisions;

55
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:10,091
you wouldn't have anything without electricity.

56
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:13,217
You won't even have these "Exits" here written.

57
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:15,925
You would have walked into the walls.

58
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:21,050
So much of this Vishnumaya has worked,

59
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,966
but She is a Maya. She can create a maya.

60
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:28,966
And this has created a big maya in the minds of human beings

61
00:06:29,008 --> 00:06:32,799
that we are on top of the world. You're not.

62
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:42,759
If electricity recedes from you, you'll become again

63
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:49,175
the same primitive people making electricity out of rubbing the stones -- take it from Me.

64
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:55,759
This flow of electricity is available to you for your good,

65
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:03,050
and not for your destruction. But what has happened today

66
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:07,883
is that using this electricity for your destruction.

67
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:12,966
I remember about, say, thirty, forty years back, or even earlier

68
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:18,509
when we saw the films, they were not colored films, American films

69
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:25,175
were beautiful films with substance in it. They wouldn't show one married man

70
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:28,675
running after another married woman. None of these stories.

71
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:34,133
Very pure form of beautiful family life.

72
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:38,925
Everything nourishing was shown.

73
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:47,217
We don't hear of any such thing where they showed evil winning over.

74
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:52,966
Now you find they show a thief, and the thief becomes the hero.

75
00:07:53,008 --> 00:08:00,467
Then the people see those films, and the children especially

76
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:05,800
I've seen have that thief as the symbol of something great.

77
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:10,841
So they are going against the Void completely,

78
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:13,717
against the religion that is within us, absolutely.

79
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:24,091
The thing that was to nourish the Void, the one that was to sustain you

80
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:31,675
in your valences, is now disturbing the Void completely.

81
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:36,300
That's the maya part of it - the same electricity

82
00:08:36,342 --> 00:08:41,592
which was to give you the right path, the light in the darkness,

83
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:49,799
is now sucking you in like a magnet towards your destruction.

84
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:57,759
This is the Vishnumaya Who came to this country in such a big way

85
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:03,759
and then spread all over. Has given ideas to everyone.

86
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:08,342
People picked up all your techniques, all your styles,

87
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:13,425
I mean you have Hollywood and all these very famous people

88
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:16,425
here who have thrived on this electricity.

89
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:22,592
But without thanking the Vishnumaya, they started doing things

90
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:29,050
which were against Vishnumaya. This Vishnumaya is the One Who has helped you

91
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:33,342
because She is the Sister of Shri Krishna;

92
00:09:33,383 --> 00:09:37,592
and because this is the domain of Shri Krishna, She came down here to help you.

93
00:09:37,592 --> 00:09:40,717
Now She's the Sister -- this must be understood very well.

94
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:44,883
Now sisterly relation is a pure relationship.

95
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:49,925
Now, of course, everything is so confused, but that's the purest relationship

96
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:52,841
between the brother and the sister.

97
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:57,925
The brother is protected by sister.

98
00:09:57,925 --> 00:10:08,799
And the sister's chastity is looked after by the brother.

99
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,258
A brother who doesn't feel hurt

100
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:17,133
if his sister chastity is in danger

101
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:21,008
or she plays about with her chastity, he is not a brother.

102
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:24,759
He is not a brother anymore. He's responsible

103
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,592
to see that his sister keeps her chastity.

104
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:34,133
Only her chastity can protect him -- it's a mutual working.

105
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:41,592
This feeling, if it does not develop that, "She is my sister

106
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:45,550
and that I have to look after her chastity,

107
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:47,509
for that I have to behave myself well,

108
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:50,300
so that she doesn't find faults with me."

109
00:10:50,342 --> 00:10:53,925
It's such a cleansing process this relationship has,

110
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:58,008
as much as the electricity has the cleansing process for you.

111
00:10:58,008 --> 00:11:01,841
Everywhere what the electricity does,

112
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:06,091
a sister does for her brother -- she cooks for him,

113
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:12,799
she tells him the right path, she enlightens him and sometimes

114
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,799
shocks him, also. They have to have certain shocks;

115
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,966
otherwise they will not know how to work it out.

116
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:26,717
And the best of all, she's the one for whom you have to be

117
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:32,258
very careful to know the technique how to handle your sister.

118
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,799
If you do not know how to handle your sister,

119
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,841
you can be absolutely wrong

120
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:45,467
and you may get it -- something that you would never expect to get.

121
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:49,759
So one must understand how to handle a sister.

122
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,509
In this case, we have to know that the same

123
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:59,717
was born again at the time of Shri Krishna as Draupadi.

124
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:10,342
She took Her birth as Draupadi. And when Draupadi was attacked by the Kauravas,

125
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:15,759
they wanted to remove Her sari.

126
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:23,258
So remove the sari itself is a symbol that they challenged her chastity.

127
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,550
Now if you see in the Maya Nagri, women have no sense at all

128
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:33,091
that they should cover this part of their body.

129
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,925
In this Maya Nagri, the other way round.

130
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:40,592
When I heard the very responsible person saying that, "In our culture,

131
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:47,050
women must expose their body." What is this culture? Is anti-Krishna,

132
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:52,050
completely anti-Vishnumaya. Such people

133
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:58,759
will get into trouble, I'm sure, with electrical problems.

134
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:13,509
The brothers who do not bother about the chastity of the husband of their sister,

135
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:25,258
and also supporting and asking to do wrong things, hide his things,

136
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:33,966
are also equally responsible. Like in Sahaja Yoga, you know

137
00:13:34,008 --> 00:13:39,300
that a sister is to be protected; and the sister husband,

138
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:44,091
if he's doing anything wrong, he's to be told off by the brother.

139
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:51,050
Like once in India, one newspaper passed some remarks about Me.

140
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,759
My brothers were up in arms. I thought,

141
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,300
"Now, it's going to be terrible. How am I to manage it?"

142
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,217
It was a big, strong ... They were going to go to the courts. When I told them, "I'll not go to the courts."

143
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:04,925
"All right, don't go. But we'll go."

144
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:08,217
They told My husband also. My husband and My brothers put together,

145
00:14:08,258 --> 00:14:12,217
it was formidable! I didn't know what to do.

146
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:17,133
I wrote to one Sahaja Yogi that, "Go and see the editor of the newspaper.

147
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:18,717
Tell him that these are My brothers,

148
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:24,217
be careful. They are very powerful people in India and from here My husband. It's terrible."

149
00:14:24,258 --> 00:14:30,133
But they would not apologize. So I thought of another Vishnumaya

150
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:40,258
that there was a big strike and the paper was closed for exactly six months.

151
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:47,091
And they had to go in for a big, very big losses. And when they started,

152
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:52,133
the people who were working there came back and said that,

153
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:56,717
"Why did you write against Shri Mataji? We're not going to come back."

154
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,717
And they had to apologize.

155
00:14:59,717 --> 00:15:06,509
So how the brother's love can compel even Adi Shakti

156
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:13,759
to do things that She would not normally do. In the same way,

157
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:19,925
when Draupadi was challenged, Shri Krishna was not in Hastinapur

158
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:29,759
where it happened. He was thousand, at least more than thousand miles away from that place.

159
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:39,759
He said that, "Shankha chakra gada padma, garuda lai sidhare."

160
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:47,300
He came on His condor with all His weapons -- shankha, chakra, gada, padma.

161
00:15:47,342 --> 00:15:53,634
All these He brought to save the chastity of His Sister.

162
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:56,383
There are many incidents in our history,

163
00:15:56,425 --> 00:16:02,509
I don't know if I can cite anything in your history. But I would say

164
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:07,425
when I see Abraham Lincoln I think he was a great brother

165
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:15,383
to the Statue of Liberty. The way he fought for women

166
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:20,050
in such pure love and without taking any money,

167
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:32,467
without charging them anything, to punish the husbands who were drunkards.

168
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:37,841
That's just like a very good, powerful brother to behave.

169
00:16:37,883 --> 00:16:43,383
But those feelings are now dying out I think.

170
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:52,675
But say in Russia, when I went, went to see Lenin's house and through out,

171
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:57,759
apart from his wife, was his sister who helped him --

172
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:02,383
to type for him, to do all his official work.

173
00:17:02,425 --> 00:17:09,925
He has written volumes and volumes of books in that small age

174
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:12,467
of fifty-four years, volumes!

175
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:16,592
First of all he was in Siberia and just imagine,

176
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:20,675
this sister of his has typed most of it.

177
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:27,425
Throughout in the whole tour, we felt the presence of the sister

178
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:30,966
and the way she has helped her brother.

179
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:37,175
This relationship is so pure which doesn't want anything.

180
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:41,925
A wife may say that, "If you don't give me a coat, I'll divorce you."

181
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:45,425
May in England and possibly in America they say so.

182
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:51,509
But a sister cannot divorce. She cannot divorce.

183
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:56,467
This time in the newspaper, they published the name of My brother.

184
00:17:56,509 --> 00:18:00,383
So I said, "What can I do? He's My brother, so he's My brother."

185
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:09,091
Good, bad, anything, he's My brother, I cannot divorce.

186
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:15,634
It's something, a relationship which you cannot break.

187
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:19,759
Nature has given you this relationship.

188
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,966
But when you come to the collective, it's very important

189
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:32,717
that we must respect this relationship. If you do not respect this relationship,

190
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:40,008
you cannot work out collectively. Like in a party I go

191
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,342
and I feel something very funny happening.

192
00:18:44,383 --> 00:18:50,425
Somebody's wife is entangled with somebody's husband.

193
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:55,091
All sorts of funny things happen. But in collective

194
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:59,425
if you know, except for my wife the rest of them are my sisters.

195
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:01,509
The purity settles in like that,

196
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,300
you don't have to worry. They're my sisters.

197
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:11,091
And your eyes steady out.

198
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:14,675
Innocence starts pouring out of your eyes.

199
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:21,592
It's a very, very simple thing. So in the eye, when you get your Realization,

200
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:25,509
you get a glint -- must have seen, there's a shine

201
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:31,467
that is Vishnumaya. That is the Vishnumaya which shines through your eyes.

202
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:36,467
And She's the One Who makes you through the maya of Vishnumaya.

203
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:41,550
This glint in the eye you must have seen in people who are realized souls

204
00:19:41,592 --> 00:19:51,841
and this glint in the eye is the one that makes you understand and feel the beauty

205
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:58,883
and the power of sisterly/brotherly relationship.

206
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:07,467
In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, I found it impossible to establish this.

207
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:16,300
So I said, "Let's try the Vishnumaya." And it worked.

208
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:20,133
Actually, naturally we know this is wrong.

209
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:24,133
We know that it is wrong, naturally.

210
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:26,799
We don't have to have a law for it.

211
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,799
One lady come to America with her brother and she told Me

212
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,883
when I had not come to America, "It's a funny place."

213
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:39,133
She said, "I went to America and we wanted to stay in one room",

214
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:42,175
because they wanted to save some money. They said, "No. If you are brothers

215
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:47,133
and sisters, you can't stay." She said, "Why? I mean in India

216
00:20:47,175 --> 00:20:49,592
if you are brother and sister you can always stay.

217
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:57,217
If you are not brother and sister, then of course you can't stay, you don't stay together,

218
00:20:57,258 --> 00:21:00,175
the other way round. If you are brother and sister

219
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,800
you cannot stay in one room in a hotel under law.

220
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:08,841
And it's a father and a daughter you can't stay in one room.

221
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:14,050
Absurd. I mean for us Indians it's a shock. I said, "But why?"

222
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,425
I just couldn't understand. Now I know what it is,

223
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:21,467
that it has become now a law to that extent.

224
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:25,133
To us, it is absurd to have such a law.

225
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:28,799
And, as we have learned so many things from you

226
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,050
about electricity, you also better learn from us certain thing

227
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,841
about Vishnumaya's powers.

228
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:40,342
There's no harm in learning something for the roots,

229
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:43,425
because if the tree has gone wrong,

230
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:48,300
it has to learn something very much essential from the roots and that is it,

231
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:52,675
the purity of relationship between brothers and sisters.

232
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:54,883
The sister relationship

233
00:21:54,925 --> 00:22:03,883
always gives a very big cementing force for the husband and wife.

234
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:07,759
I know if My husband tries to trouble Me,

235
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:11,467
his own sister will be after his life.

236
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:17,091
And he'd better be careful about it and same with Me.

237
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:24,175
If I do anything wrong, My brother will side with My husband and not with Me.

238
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,634
So it cements the relationships very well.

239
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:34,091
In the history that I know of two very beautiful incidents I'll tell you

240
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:39,717
which come to My mind today is one of Shivaji.

241
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:45,883
When Shivaji -- it's twice it has happened in his lifetime which is very remarkable.

242
00:22:45,925 --> 00:22:53,008
He was once presented with a lady, was very beautiful.

243
00:22:53,050 --> 00:23:00,841
And people had plundered her things and all her ornaments,

244
00:23:00,883 --> 00:23:07,675
because she was a daughter of a Muslim courtesan,

245
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:13,008
as you call the courtier. And they tried to plunder him

246
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:22,300
and they brought this beautiful woman before Shivaji. So Shivaji looked at her and said,

247
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:28,799
"Please remove your veil", because Muslims have a veil.

248
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:36,675
And when she removed her veil, he said that, "If my mother was as beautiful as you are,

249
00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:42,883
I would have been equally beautiful." What a thing to say - what a poetic thing to say!

250
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:45,133
That is that, "If you were my mother,

251
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:48,091
I would have been as beautiful as you are",

252
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:52,634
means you are my sister.

253
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:55,008
And then he got very angry with all these people

254
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,342
and he asked them that, "You'd better take her away

255
00:23:57,383 --> 00:24:00,966
and never do such a thing to any woman." And not only,

256
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:04,300
but he gave lots of ornaments and lots of things to her

257
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,050
to say that she's a sister

258
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:10,133
going to the husband with all respect and regard.

259
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:19,383
And this gentleman, her husband, was a very deadly enemy of Shivaji.

260
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:28,925
How he solved the problem with such purity and then this gentleman

261
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:33,717
become sort of a milder person with this gesture of his.

262
00:24:33,717 --> 00:24:39,425
Second in his lifetime we hear about a fort

263
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:46,133
which is now very close to My house in Pune was, there was a Rajput lady

264
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:50,008
called Kamal Kumari, who was entrapped by the man

265
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:57,675
who was the officer of that fort, who was a Muslim.

266
00:24:57,717 --> 00:25:02,383
And he was telling this Kamal Kumari that, "You must marry me." And she would not accept.

267
00:25:02,425 --> 00:25:08,841
They had brought her from somewhere sort of by force. And she would not accept;

268
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:15,133
she was Rajput. And he said, "By tomorrow, you'll have to marry me."

269
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:25,133
This lady didn't know what to do, so with someone very secretly

270
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:29,634
she sent a letter to Shivaji with a rakhi.

271
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:36,300
But it reached the mother of Shivaji.

272
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:46,342
Mother sent a letter, sent a message, to Shivaji on a horse that, "Come here as fast as possible --

273
00:25:46,342 --> 00:25:49,634
if you're eating your food, then come here to wash your hands"

274
00:25:49,634 --> 00:25:54,217
to that extent. And Shivaji was so obedient to his mother,

275
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:59,133
very obedient. One has to learn from his character.

276
00:25:59,175 --> 00:26:06,050
He rushed there, because obedience was his power.

277
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:09,759
He rushed there and asked, "Mother, what is it?"

278
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,300
She said, "No, I want to play chess with you."

279
00:26:13,342 --> 00:26:18,425
He said, "Why now?" "I must play chess." He couldn't understand.

280
00:26:18,467 --> 00:26:24,050
And she played chess and she won something. She could have told him,

281
00:26:24,091 --> 00:26:30,799
but she just wanted to sort of put a Vishnumaya on him. He lost.

282
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,342
"Mother, what do you want?" She said, "Today

283
00:26:34,383 --> 00:26:41,509
I want you by night to capture this fort."

284
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:52,509
"Today?" "Yes." Then she showed him the letter and the rakhi.

285
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:56,799
Rakhi was so powerful that a mother had to ask her son,

286
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,800
who was responsible for the deliverance of Maharashtra

287
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:09,841
from the clutches of the Muslims, that he should go to this fort and capture it.

288
00:27:09,883 --> 00:27:16,759
Such a powerful message out of that string. So. All right. Came out.

289
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:19,425
He was quite upset how to do it.

290
00:27:19,467 --> 00:27:22,550
Suddenly there was one gentleman called Tanaji,

291
00:27:22,592 --> 00:27:26,675
he had come to invite him for his son's wedding with his uncle.

292
00:27:26,717 --> 00:27:33,550
And he saw him so upset he said, "Why are you so upset, sir?"

293
00:27:33,592 --> 00:27:38,050
He said, "My mother has asked me such and such thing." He said, "All right, I'm going.

294
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:42,342
You don't have to go, because we'll have many Tanaji's like me

295
00:27:42,383 --> 00:27:46,717
but we have only one Shivaji. I'm going to do it." He said, "But your son is going to marry."

296
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:52,342
He said, "First let my sword marry this fort,

297
00:27:52,383 --> 00:27:56,008
then I will marry my son." Such people we had also.

298
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:01,175
Such sacrifice. Only on that rakhi. Think of that, only one rakhi!

299
00:28:01,217 --> 00:28:04,008
All right. They didn't know this girl, they didn't know her father,

300
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,550
they didn't know anything about her, they had never seen her.

301
00:28:06,592 --> 00:28:13,383
Can you think of somebody who will do like this in modern times?

302
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:17,008
We are supposed to be very evolved, powerful, great people.

303
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:21,217
Even in the pictures we need not show it.

304
00:28:21,258 --> 00:28:23,799
Nobody will come to see such a film because

305
00:28:23,841 --> 00:28:29,800
they'll feel so low. And he went there

306
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:38,634
and he used a kind of a big lizard which went and fixed the nails.

307
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:46,925
With a rope he climbed up and they conquered and won that fort.

308
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:50,883
It was decided that if they are successful they should lit fire

309
00:28:50,925 --> 00:28:53,759
which Shivaji can see and come down.

310
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,675
He saw the fire early in the morning so went there.

311
00:28:55,717 --> 00:29:00,175
And under a tree the dead body of this Tanaji was lying.

312
00:29:00,217 --> 00:29:08,091
He looked at it and he said, "We have got the fort but we have lost a lion."

313
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:11,675
That's why it's called as the Fort of the Lion, Sinhagad,

314
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:14,133
which you can see from My house very clearly.

315
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:18,425
But these are the monuments of a small thing called a rakhi.

316
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:28,217
A small symbol of expression

317
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:35,133
that can capture forts after forts.

318
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:42,592
Another one where -- I've told this story before but I'll repeat it today --

319
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:46,091
was when Alexander the Great arrested

320
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:53,175
one king called Puru. Alexander had married an Indian lady

321
00:29:53,217 --> 00:30:02,008
and the great Alexander was in jail. That was the day of Vishnumaya.

322
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:09,467
So she sent -- this lady was very clever, his wife -- she sent a rakhi

323
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:16,717
in a small, little thali covered nicely to the King Puru.

324
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:24,258
And, as the rituals are, that day this was presented to him. So he had to accept.

325
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,300
If it is sent, you have to accept. A sister sends it with deliberations

326
00:30:29,342 --> 00:30:34,342
but you have to accept. And he accepted it, and it was tied.

327
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:36,759
Then he said, "Who is my sister?"

328
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:43,509
They said, "Your sister is the wife of Alexander." Said,

329
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,799
"Oh God, that means I have arrested my own brother-in-law!"

330
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:50,425
Immediately becomes a brother-in-law, immediately.

331
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:53,217
No marriage took place, nothing. He's a brother-in-law.

332
00:30:53,258 --> 00:31:01,717
He rushed to the jail, fell flat before the great emperor.

333
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,467
He couldn't understand, "What's happening to Puru?

334
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:10,467
Why did he do all this?" He said, "Sir, I am sorry", in his own language,

335
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:13,217
"I'm sorry I didn't know you were my brother-in-law.

336
00:31:13,217 --> 00:31:16,799
I'm sorry whatever I've done. Will you forgive me?" and all that.

337
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:23,300
And he brought him, asked him to sit on his throne.

338
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,008
He couldn't understand, "What's this going on?"

339
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,008
"Please." Made him sit there, garlanded him, did his aarti,

340
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:37,800
gave him ornaments, gave him big garlands of diamonds and rubies and things,

341
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:43,841
and touched his feet, washed his feet and then, with great honor, sent him home.

342
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:45,799
He couldn't understand.

343
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,342
"Has he gone mad or he's possessed by someone?"

344
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:51,175
He must have thought, "Some Greek has possessed this fellow",

345
00:31:51,217 --> 00:31:53,841
the way he was surrendering.

346
00:31:53,883 --> 00:31:59,592
When he went home his wife was smiling.

347
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:01,091
He said, "Why are you smiling?"

348
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:04,592
She said, "I knew the trick will work with Indian mind."

349
00:32:04,634 --> 00:32:08,925
"What was the trick?" She showed him one string. "This was the trick."

350
00:32:08,966 --> 00:32:10,925
He couldn't understand, started looking at it.

351
00:32:10,966 --> 00:32:16,634
"What is this?" She said, "This is the rakhi. This is the thing I sent him.

352
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:21,592
This has the symbol of a sister, that's how you're released."

353
00:32:21,592 --> 00:32:24,133
Alexander sat back.

354
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:30,175
He said, "Oh God, these people can release their enemies on a string?

355
00:32:30,217 --> 00:32:33,759
I can't capture these people. They are too good.

356
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:37,717
They are too subtle. These subtleties we cannot understand."

357
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,217
And he turned back. But he took some poets with him

358
00:32:41,217 --> 00:32:46,217
who sang his praise, how he was, what a generous man.

359
00:32:46,217 --> 00:32:51,675
But I must say it is rather surprising to see such a subtle man in Greece.

360
00:32:51,717 --> 00:32:56,634
But maybe that was the time for them to understand subtleties,

361
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,841
but today I don't have much hopes.

362
00:32:58,883 --> 00:33:02,008
As I've seen them, they are not that subtle.

363
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:08,966
They only have people like Onassis who are their heroes, whom they worship.

364
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:12,258
From where to what we have come? How we have used

365
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,217
the same good things from horrible things now.

366
00:33:15,258 --> 00:33:18,799
How far we have gone. And I would say the same Vishnumaya

367
00:33:18,841 --> 00:33:22,217
has now put into this maya that you go to hell now,

368
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:25,258
finished. It is She Who has arranged this point.

369
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,592
She doesn't think that Americans deserve to be in Sahaja Yoga.

370
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:35,133
It is She Who's fighting Me. She says, "Mother, forget it, forget it, forget it!"

371
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:39,217
See the films -- one worse than the other.

372
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:44,050
You see the recent pictures, the modern ones, you can't even see them,

373
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,634
you have to close your eyes. The same power now

374
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:52,467
is for your destruction, used by you only.

375
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:57,841
You are using it for your own destruction. All these films

376
00:33:57,883 --> 00:34:02,383
are working you out to fight each other,

377
00:34:02,425 --> 00:34:05,008
destroy each other, how to kill each other,

378
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:09,217
how to be violent, how to be ugly, how to be shameless,

379
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:12,550
how to have no self-respect, and no respect for others.

380
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,008
Is all coming through these medias.

381
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:19,550
Your children are so rude. Nobody listens to anyone.

382
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:26,800
Nobody respects their elders. If somebody is a simple, honest, intelligent,

383
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:32,175
brilliant man, they think he's a fool because he doesn't know how to outwit you.

384
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:34,592
He doesn't know how to talk sharply,

385
00:34:34,592 --> 00:34:37,717
because he doesn't know how to insult you all the time.

386
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:44,258
The whole film industry is now working out how to coin

387
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,217
more insulting words. The more insulting words there are,

388
00:34:48,217 --> 00:34:51,841
the better it is. And that's what the public wants,

389
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:55,800
because now it has become a economic thing

390
00:34:55,841 --> 00:35:02,467
to use films for economic purposes. When money becomes everything --

391
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,300
what is prostitution, you get money, what's wrong?

392
00:35:05,342 --> 00:35:07,133
What is wrong in destroying your family?

393
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:08,966
You get money? It's all right.

394
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:10,717
Now, are you going to take this money with you,

395
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:14,467
or are you going to leave this barbaric children on this country?

396
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:19,133
What are you going to achieve? And the money orientation is so much

397
00:35:19,175 --> 00:35:23,799
that people say that Americans are the most miserly people,

398
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:30,050
they are very self-indulgent and the most miserly people, while here it is the Vishnumaya

399
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:36,966
which is the most generous thing. She burns Herself off to give you light.

400
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:43,300
And the miserliness also comes with money-orientation.

401
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,300
They are also very mischievous,

402
00:35:47,342 --> 00:35:51,966
sometimes they try to play such tricks which are very heinous and horrible.

403
00:35:52,008 --> 00:35:59,799
Then electricity has to work and I don't know, I don't know about Her, how She'll work it out.

404
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:04,342
But She's very angry, with Americans especially,

405
00:36:04,383 --> 00:36:08,509
because this is the country of Her Brother.

406
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,883
This is the country where Her Brother rules, and She wants

407
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:21,383
everything to be all right, because from here is generated all these nonsensical films

408
00:36:21,383 --> 00:36:26,091
nonsensical things which are destroying the whole world.

409
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:32,050
AIDS is one of the blessings of Vishnumaya.

410
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:36,425
It comes from Left Vishuddhi, people do not know.

411
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:40,925
You start perspiring on the Left Vishuddhi to begin with.

412
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:43,717
When people start feeling guilty,

413
00:36:43,717 --> 00:36:49,883
they should face it  and get rid of it.

414
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:53,425
Of course it starts, as you say, with right sidedness.

415
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:58,175
But this right sidedness ultimately ends up into Left Vishuddhi.

416
00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:02,175
And then the residual part of it starts generating.

417
00:37:02,175 --> 00:37:07,634
This kind of a weakness in a human being,

418
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:13,342
because it is also the pure form of motherhood,

419
00:37:13,342 --> 00:37:19,759
is the Center Heart, is the pure form of motherhood.

420
00:37:19,799 --> 00:37:25,467
You see a child, you see a girl who is innocent. What interests her

421
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:29,634
is her little dolly. She's the mother, out and out.

422
00:37:29,634 --> 00:37:35,300
If she's properly brought up, from very childhood she's a mother.

423
00:37:35,342 --> 00:37:41,050
And motherhood is the epitome of womanhood.

424
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:44,467
There are some Sahaja Yogis also who are so stupid

425
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:47,467
they don't want to have children after marriage.

426
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:50,383
They should get out of Sahaja Yoga, immediately.

427
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:54,467
We have not done all this to have people here

428
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:58,217
who cannot produce children. If they can, they should.

429
00:37:58,217 --> 00:38:02,925
The reason is there are so many great souls who want to be born.

430
00:38:02,966 --> 00:38:08,883
These are the great fruits which are going to be prospering

431
00:38:08,883 --> 00:38:16,342
on the tree of your family life. And if you do not want to have any children,

432
00:38:16,342 --> 00:38:24,342
then what are you doing here? So the Vishnumaya's main thing

433
00:38:24,383 --> 00:38:32,966
is that a woman has to be a mother. Then that motherhood

434
00:38:33,008 --> 00:38:37,050
gives her that special capacity to shine.

435
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:43,925
Now it starts with the Left Vishuddhi, the AIDS goes to the Center Heart.

436
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:49,467
The Center Heart is challenged. The motherhood is lost.

437
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:52,467
That's how the antibodies become weak.

438
00:38:52,509 --> 00:38:54,799
Once they are attacked, they become weak,

439
00:38:54,799 --> 00:39:00,175
they cannot fight the disease and that's how the person who gets AIDS

440
00:39:00,217 --> 00:39:06,759
has to face things in such a manner that it has no antibodies,

441
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:14,925
so he becomes allergic to everything and he dies. To fight the AIDS,

442
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:21,966
the sisters' and brothers' relations must be established

443
00:39:21,966 --> 00:39:25,799
so that sisters can look out for men,

444
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:31,091
the way they are behaving, and they

445
00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:35,050
should look out for sisters, the way they are behaving.

446
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:41,425
In this whole satanic movement I find

447
00:39:41,467 --> 00:39:44,467
the men become physically attacked

448
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:49,634
and women become mentally attacked. And it's such an attack

449
00:39:49,634 --> 00:39:53,008
that women are difficult to get out of it.

450
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:58,883
First of all, we have to decide what is our goal

451
00:39:58,925 --> 00:40:03,217
is to become the Spirit, and not a sex point.

452
00:40:03,217 --> 00:40:07,925
This maya has changed your goals completely.

453
00:40:07,925 --> 00:40:15,634
It's going to make you into worms or I don't know what else.

454
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:19,300
Actually, this is what the Americans have to understand:

455
00:40:19,342 --> 00:40:23,509
where are they going? Everybody thinks that Americans

456
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:26,509
are half-mad if not full-mad.

457
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:29,467
Any American coming into any organization,

458
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:32,800
"Oh, beware, American." Americans may not know about it.

459
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:38,175
They never consider an American as a completely sane person.

460
00:40:38,217 --> 00:40:39,925
What is the reason? Because

461
00:40:39,925 --> 00:40:43,634
of this queer, weird, stupid ideas they have.

462
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:52,217
But I heard that here the people claim that we have a fundamental right to be stupid and mad.

463
00:40:52,217 --> 00:41:00,091
This kind of a thing that is moving today in the country where you live,

464
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:04,383
and if you have to save it, you have to turn their faces towards God.

465
00:41:04,425 --> 00:41:09,966
You have to turn their faces towards Self-Realization. And this is a very, very difficult task

466
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:16,467
for which you all Sahaja Yogis, I request you and I pray for you,

467
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:22,133
that you develop that kind of a power which is the Power of Vishnumaya

468
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:24,799
that you shine with the Power of Vishnumaya.

469
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,258
When I see your Statue of Liberty,

470
00:41:27,258 --> 00:41:29,717
I think she is the Vishnumaya  here standing.

471
00:41:29,759 --> 00:41:32,883
Why didn't they make a man stand there,

472
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:39,925
why a woman? She is the symbol of the Sister, of Vishnumaya,

473
00:41:39,925 --> 00:41:42,592
and if you have to have your liberty, have it --

474
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:47,425
but liberty of wisdom, not of stupidity.

475
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:54,050
And this is what I have to tell you today in this great country of Shri Krishna,

476
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:58,550
that you'd better be on the lookout. Better be on the lookout.

477
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:05,925
You can say that She really rules in a proper way in South America,

478
00:42:05,925 --> 00:42:13,966
and that was Her domain, too. And there electricity is not so prevalent.

479
00:42:14,008 --> 00:42:19,550
But the perversion has started because they started producing cocaine

480
00:42:19,592 --> 00:42:22,675
and other horrible things to spoil your Left Vishuddhi.

481
00:42:22,717 --> 00:42:31,634
One feels guilty with one thing in the North America

482
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:39,383
and another one makes it bad through cocaine, and is nicely transported here

483
00:42:39,425 --> 00:42:49,217
for you to spoil your Vishuddhi. This is an attack on Vishnumaya,

484
00:42:49,258 --> 00:42:53,217
another attack on Vishnumaya from the South

485
00:42:53,258 --> 00:42:57,008
because they are exporting. And once I asked them,

486
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,050
"Why do you export it?" They said,

487
00:42:59,091 --> 00:43:02,258
"That is their lookout to save their people; it's not our lookout."

488
00:43:02,258 --> 00:43:07,008
In Colombia, officially. They feel that,

489
00:43:07,008 --> 00:43:09,675
"If the Americans cannot look after themselves,

490
00:43:09,717 --> 00:43:11,759
how can we look after our people?"

491
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:16,175
And they're making a big money out of you because,

492
00:43:16,217 --> 00:43:18,800
"You paid so much attention to money. All right, have it.

493
00:43:18,841 --> 00:43:23,675
We'll also have money by giving you this horrible thing

494
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:26,467
to spoil your Vishuddhis and take all your money,

495
00:43:26,509 --> 00:43:31,342
if you think money's that important." It's something, a very big play,

496
00:43:31,383 --> 00:43:35,550
it's a maya, it's a horrible maya into which this country has gone into.

497
00:43:35,592 --> 00:43:41,175
And you have to do it by shining examples

498
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:46,799
to show how starkingly it is horrid

499
00:43:46,799 --> 00:43:50,008
the way we accept things so easily.

500
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:54,550
I'm sure this Vishnumaya will crack certain nuts here

501
00:43:54,592 --> 00:44:00,509
and I hope it will create a new path for Sahaja Yogis to follow,

502
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,925
to get more people into Sahaja Yoga

503
00:44:02,966 --> 00:44:07,342
in a proper, dynamic way and settle them in Sahaja Yoga.

504
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:36,050
May God bless you.

505
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:39,467
Before we start the Puja, I really admire the way

506
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:42,509
you have created this maya here.

507
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:48,800
I hope this will cover the blinding maya

508
00:44:48,841 --> 00:44:52,133
and put people into their right path.

509
00:44:52,175 --> 00:44:56,300
I must say I admire it, the way you have done it. It's beautifully done.

510
00:44:56,342 --> 00:44:59,091
May God bless you.

511
00:44:59,091 --> 00:46:04,425
One of the names of Devi is also Nirmala, because it means "pure",

512
00:46:04,467 --> 00:46:09,799
also these days people are talking of Khalsa and Khalistan.

513
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:14,300
Khalis means "pure." Khalistan is the place

514
00:46:14,342 --> 00:46:18,133
where the pure people have to settle down, that is Sahaja Yogis.

515
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:24,425
That's what was said that only the Khalis people, means the people who are pure

516
00:46:24,467 --> 00:46:30,425
have to form Khalistan, not those who are violent or those who are stupid.

517
00:46:30,467 --> 00:46:36,175
Is meant for the people who are Sahaja Yogis. Was said for the Sahaja Yogis.

518
00:46:36,217 --> 00:46:43,509
The saints would never tell that those violent people should have their Khalistan.

519
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:50,258
So, as they call it "Nirmalites" are the Khalistani people and they are the Khalsas.

520
00:46:50,258 --> 00:46:56,467
Such a misnomer under the influence of Vishnumaya.
