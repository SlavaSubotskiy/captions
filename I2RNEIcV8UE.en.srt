00:00:00,435 --> 00:00:06,435
Public Program. Vienna (Austria), 27 July 1992.

2
01:16:08,055 --> 01:16:11,638
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
01:16:17,805 --> 01:16:23,763
At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is.

4
01:16:28,971 --> 01:16:32,721
We cannot imagine about it,

5
01:16:33,013 --> 01:16:36,430
think about it or conceptualize it.

6
01:16:46,721 --> 01:16:52,138
Also unfortunately, at this human level we cannot feel it.

7
01:16:58,222 --> 01:17:02,097
We have to become a subtler being

8
01:17:02,305 --> 01:17:06,305
to feel our subtle being.

9
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:15,514
We have to be the Spirit.

10
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:24,138
Otherwise whatever we think about it

11
01:17:24,347 --> 01:17:26,430
is not reality.

12
01:17:39,805 --> 01:17:45,347
Reality has to be known by ascending

13
01:17:45,721 --> 01:17:48,679
to another state of Spirit.

14
01:17:57,138 --> 01:18:00,472
Now, let us know what is the truth.

15
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:09,388
The truth is we are not this body, this mind

16
01:18:10,638 --> 01:18:13,971
Is... Sorry, go ahead.

17
01:18:19,347 --> 01:18:23,347
This is not your conditionings,

18
01:18:23,595 --> 01:18:26,430
nor your ego, emotions,

19
01:18:26,596 --> 01:18:29,555
but it is pure Spirit.

20
01:18:38,263 --> 01:18:43,097
The second truth is that there is an All-pervading Power

21
01:18:43,305 --> 01:18:45,472
of Divine Love,

22
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:56,138
which does all the living work.

23
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:05,180
We see these beautiful flowers –  it’s a miracle,

24
01:19:08,721 --> 01:19:10,888
but we take it for granted.

25
01:19:13,971 --> 01:19:16,055
Look at our eyes,

26
01:19:16,263 --> 01:19:20,222
which is a miracle itself – it’s a camera.

27
01:19:26,097 --> 01:19:30,138
Look at our brain, which is such a computer.

28
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:37,055
But we take it for granted

29
01:19:39,347 --> 01:19:41,721
and do not think about it.

30
01:19:44,013 --> 01:19:46,013
Who does this work?

31
01:19:48,388 --> 01:19:51,388
Who runs our heart?

32
01:20:02,013 --> 01:20:05,180
What's the matter? Please take the child out.

33
01:20:13,721 --> 01:20:16,846
We call it in medical terminology

34
01:20:17,138 --> 01:20:20,430
that autonomous nervous system runs the heart.

35
01:20:26,013 --> 01:20:28,472
But who is this auto?

36
01:20:33,013 --> 01:20:36,388
All this living work is done by

37
01:20:36,595 --> 01:20:40,222
this All-pervading Power of Divine Love.

38
01:20:48,595 --> 01:20:53,097
Whatever I’m telling you, you need not take it blindfolded.

39
01:20:58,055 --> 01:21:02,595
But you have to keep your mind open

40
01:21:03,222 --> 01:21:05,638
like a scientist

41
01:21:08,638 --> 01:21:11,721
and treat it as a hypothesis.

42
01:21:14,514 --> 01:21:18,679
And if you find that it is true

43
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:23,180
then you have to accept it as honest people.

44
01:21:28,055 --> 01:21:31,846
Because it is for your benevolence

45
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:36,097
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

46
01:21:44,638 --> 01:21:50,638
So now, within us is based this mechanism,

47
01:21:50,846 --> 01:21:54,805
which has been shown to you and about which they have told you.

48
01:22:02,595 --> 01:22:05,721
And there is this power

49
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:08,638
which is going to connect you

50
01:22:08,846 --> 01:22:12,222
to this All-pervading Power of Divine Love.

51
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:23,805
We are all born

52
01:22:24,013 --> 01:22:28,430
with that Divinity within us in a potential state.

53
01:22:35,138 --> 01:22:38,138
And it is quite intact.

54
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:42,013
Whatever you might have done,

55
01:22:42,222 --> 01:22:45,388
whatever so called mistakes you might have committed,

56
01:22:45,721 --> 01:22:50,097
this faith of Divinity is also within us.

57
01:22:58,097 --> 01:23:01,180
We had this faith from our childhood,

58
01:23:01,388 --> 01:23:04,055
but gradually we lost it.

59
01:23:09,555 --> 01:23:12,888
We had faith that there is something beyond

60
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:16,055
and that’s what we have lost it.

61
01:23:20,138 --> 01:23:23,222
Or we are misled.

62
01:23:29,595 --> 01:23:32,055
We have to understand that

63
01:23:32,263 --> 01:23:37,180
this Divinity is absolutely there,

64
01:23:37,472 --> 01:23:41,846
untarnished, without any problem,

65
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,430
because it is of eternal nature.

66
01:23:57,388 --> 01:24:02,222
Like clouds, maybe some of the actions

67
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:05,846
in our life might have covered it.

68
01:24:14,055 --> 01:24:19,679
But you’ll be amazed to see that it is there, alive.

69
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:29,388
Now, the second problem we have to understand

70
01:24:29,595 --> 01:24:34,347
that all world problems come from human beings.

71
01:24:40,013 --> 01:24:42,555
And all human problems come from

72
01:24:42,721 --> 01:24:45,514
these fundamental centers within us.

73
01:24:50,763 --> 01:24:55,596
When these fundamental centers go into problems

74
01:24:55,846 --> 01:24:59,846
we get all kinds of physical, mental,

75
01:25:00,055 --> 01:25:02,888
emotional, social, political

76
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:06,097
and also spiritual problems.

77
01:25:12,529 --> 01:25:16,610
Physical, mental, emotional,

78
01:25:16,805 --> 01:25:21,595
political, economical and social.

79
01:25:22,763 --> 01:25:28,679
So, if these centers could be corrected, nourished,

80
01:25:28,971 --> 01:25:32,679
made healthy all the problems will be solved.

81
01:25:41,971 --> 01:25:47,971
The time has come for us to achieve that state of Spirit.

82
01:25:53,472 --> 01:25:58,971
Is a special time. I call it the blossom time.

83
01:26:00,846 --> 01:26:05,263
In the Bible they called it the Last Judgment.

84
01:26:10,055 --> 01:26:12,888
In the Koran, Puranas,

85
01:26:13,138 --> 01:26:17,555
also it is described as ”Satya Yuga”.

86
01:26:22,638 --> 01:26:26,721
And in the Koran it is described as

87
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:29,430
”Kiyama”, meaning Resurrection time.

88
01:26:34,846 --> 01:26:38,138
It is fortunate that at this time you are all born

89
01:26:38,347 --> 01:26:41,347
and that you are seekers of truth.

90
01:26:47,638 --> 01:26:52,347
Sahaja Yoga – ”Saha” means ‘with you’, is born the right

91
01:26:52,721 --> 01:26:55,222
to achieve the state of Spirit.

92
01:27:00,763 --> 01:27:02,930
”’Ja”’ is born.

93
01:27:16,638 --> 01:27:20,805
So, this right you have. All of you have got that right.

94
01:27:21,013 --> 01:27:24,430
And you have to achieve that state of Spirit.

95
01:27:31,055 --> 01:27:35,888
In short I’ll tell you what is this nature of the Spirit.

96
01:27:40,805 --> 01:27:44,097
Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty.

97
01:27:47,638 --> 01:27:50,595
So, it is a universal being.

98
01:27:55,555 --> 01:28:01,013
It exists as a witness in our heart.

99
01:28:04,763 --> 01:28:07,263
It watches whatever we are doing.

100
01:28:10,805 --> 01:28:14,347
But when it manifests in our attention

101
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:20,930
then we can feel

102
01:28:22,097 --> 01:28:25,721
the our centers and the centers of others.

103
01:28:34,263 --> 01:28:39,097
Thus we get self knowledge – selfhood.

104
01:28:41,514 --> 01:28:46,138
And also we develop a new dimension in our awareness

105
01:28:46,347 --> 01:28:49,763
called as collective consciousness,

106
01:28:57,138 --> 01:29:00,347
when you can feel the centers of others.

107
01:29:03,055 --> 01:29:07,097
If you can understand

108
01:29:07,514 --> 01:29:13,222
and master the art of Divine working

109
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:16,222
you can cure your centers

110
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:19,846
and you can cure the centers of others.

111
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:35,013
When this Kundalini pierces through your fontanel bone area

112
01:29:35,222 --> 01:29:39,721
it connects you to this All-pervading Power of Divine Love.

113
01:29:47,472 --> 01:29:51,138
Just like this instrument has got this

114
01:29:51,347 --> 01:29:54,971
connection with the mains, in the same way

115
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:58,472
you get connected with that power.

116
01:30:06,013 --> 01:30:08,971
Once this connection is fully established

117
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:13,222
all the time this dynamic energy starts flowing through you.

118
01:30:20,846 --> 01:30:26,305
You become dynamic – at the same time extremely compassionate.

119
01:30:32,138 --> 01:30:37,222
You become very wise, with divine discretion.

120
01:30:41,013 --> 01:30:43,305
On your fingertips you can feel

121
01:30:43,514 --> 01:30:46,514
your centers and the centers of others.

122
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:54,430
Everybody feels the same.

123
01:30:56,013 --> 01:30:58,638
If you want to know this is wrong or right

124
01:30:58,846 --> 01:31:01,805
you can feel it on your fingertips.

125
01:31:07,097 --> 01:31:09,638
Thus you know the absolute truth.

126
01:31:13,222 --> 01:31:16,222
If everyone feels the same way,

127
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:21,013
then how can there be quarrels? How can there be wars also?

128
01:31:30,138 --> 01:31:35,305
So, this is a new awareness,

129
01:31:35,555 --> 01:31:39,638
a new dimension, which manifests within us.

130
01:31:46,013 --> 01:31:49,555
And it takes us much beyond mental activity,

131
01:31:49,721 --> 01:31:53,721
where your thoughts cannot overpower you.

132
01:32:01,805 --> 01:32:05,638
Thoughts come from the future or from the past

133
01:32:05,846 --> 01:32:08,930
and we are dancing on the cusp of the thoughts.

134
01:32:16,097 --> 01:32:22,138
But with this happening we enter into our present.

135
01:32:27,138 --> 01:32:30,595
In between these thoughts there is a space

136
01:32:30,805 --> 01:32:33,263
where there is peace

137
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:36,430
and we enter into our peace.

138
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:49,596
This state, in this state you become

139
01:32:49,805 --> 01:32:52,888
thoughtlessly aware.

140
01:33:01,638 --> 01:33:08,138
When you start growing in your spiritual being

141
01:33:08,930 --> 01:33:13,514
then the second thing that happens to you

142
01:33:13,805 --> 01:33:17,930
is that you become

143
01:33:20,721 --> 01:33:24,763
one with reality.

144
01:33:32,595 --> 01:33:36,222
All kinds of falsehood start dropping out.

145
01:33:40,596 --> 01:33:44,846
And you know that you have become a saint.

146
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:49,472
And you become extremely confident with your knowledge.

147
01:33:57,222 --> 01:34:00,430
The Spirit is the source of joy.

148
01:34:04,013 --> 01:34:08,097
And you jump into the ocean of joy.

149
01:34:12,555 --> 01:34:15,763
Joy has no duality.

150
01:34:18,721 --> 01:34:22,430
It does not have happiness and unhappiness.

151
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:27,763
It is absolute.

152
01:34:29,846 --> 01:34:32,596
All this is your own.

153
01:34:35,222 --> 01:34:37,721
You have to just get it.

154
01:34:41,097 --> 01:34:43,721
It’s a very easy thing,

155
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:47,638
it’s very spontaneous, it’s a living process.

156
01:34:53,763 --> 01:34:56,763
For this process you don’t have to pay.

157
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:03,430
You don’t have to put in any efforts.

158
01:35:05,888 --> 01:35:07,971
It’s spontaneous.

159
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:13,180
It spontaneously sprouts.

160
01:35:16,013 --> 01:35:20,555
You have to only look after it like a gardener.

161
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:32,430
Whatever I am telling you is not a sermon or a lecture,

162
01:35:38,013 --> 01:35:41,388
it’s the actualization of the experience.

163
01:35:46,638 --> 01:35:50,971
And actualization of your baptism.

164
01:35:54,430 --> 01:35:57,638
Because you feel the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost

165
01:35:57,846 --> 01:36:00,097
coming out of your head.

166
01:36:06,097 --> 01:36:09,930
Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost.

167
01:36:14,097 --> 01:36:18,097
And Kundalini is the Primordial Mother.

168
01:36:22,888 --> 01:36:26,805
This is what is reflected in you

169
01:36:27,013 --> 01:36:30,055
as your own individual mother.

170
01:36:34,472 --> 01:36:37,805
And she gives you your second birth.

171
01:36:42,138 --> 01:36:44,305
Christ has said,

172
01:36:44,514 --> 01:36:48,555
“The humble in heart will inherit the Earth.”

173
01:36:57,222 --> 01:37:00,555
So one has to be humble.

174
01:37:04,013 --> 01:37:08,595
If you are arrogant about it, your own Kundalini won’t rise.

175
01:37:16,805 --> 01:37:19,805
Moreover

176
01:37:21,055 --> 01:37:25,263
this Kundalini knows all about you.

177
01:37:29,472 --> 01:37:32,472
She does not give you any trouble.

178
01:37:35,055 --> 01:37:40,263
And just spontaneously She manages to connect you

179
01:37:40,472 --> 01:37:43,595
to that All-pervading Divine Power.

180
01:37:50,430 --> 01:37:54,888
And for the first time you start feeling on your fingertips

181
01:37:55,971 --> 01:37:59,971
this All-pervading Power as cool breeze.

182
01:38:09,846 --> 01:38:12,305
I respect your freedom,

183
01:38:12,514 --> 01:38:17,888
and your Self Realization cannot be forced on you.

184
01:38:24,430 --> 01:38:30,388
Those who really want it, in a humble way, can have it.

185
01:38:36,846 --> 01:38:39,721
Those who do not want

186
01:38:40,013 --> 01:38:43,721
are not forced – cannot be forced.

187
01:38:47,930 --> 01:38:51,055
All such people should please leave the hall.

188
01:38:56,347 --> 01:39:01,388
It will take about 10 or 15 minutes to get your Realization.

189
01:39:06,388 --> 01:39:10,222
In this short time you should appreciate I cannot tell you

190
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:13,555
everything about this vast knowledge,

191
01:39:19,638 --> 01:39:22,013
but if you get your enlightenment

192
01:39:22,222 --> 01:39:25,388
you’ll understand this subtle knowledge very easily.

193
01:39:36,472 --> 01:39:40,430
So, those who do not want can leave the hall.

194
01:39:44,388 --> 01:39:47,846
It will hardly take 10 to 15 minutes.

195
01:39:51,595 --> 01:39:54,763
The lights are very dim, I can’t see the people.

196
01:40:08,595 --> 01:40:11,846
I know, some of you have questions –

197
01:40:12,805 --> 01:40:16,638
but just now keep them away from yourself.

198
01:40:23,222 --> 01:40:25,514
And you can write them down

199
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:28,679
and we’ll try to answer them later on.

200
01:40:38,138 --> 01:40:40,347
Can’t see them.

201
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:50,472
It's good.

202
01:41:05,638 --> 01:41:10,347
There are three conditions which are very simple.

203
01:41:14,971 --> 01:41:18,638
The first condition is that

204
01:41:18,846 --> 01:41:21,971
you all have to have  full confidence

205
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:26,596
that you will all get your Self Realization tonight.

206
01:41:39,388 --> 01:41:43,555
Second is you are not to feel guilty

207
01:41:43,721 --> 01:41:46,888
about anything whatsoever.

208
01:41:53,971 --> 01:41:58,846
This idea of sin – please take it out of your mind.

209
01:42:03,805 --> 01:42:05,805
This gives you a guilt,

210
01:42:06,013 --> 01:42:09,180
which makes your left Vishuddhi here – this chakra –

211
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:11,971
very weak.

212
01:42:21,595 --> 01:42:26,514
And this causes a disease called angina,

213
01:42:26,679 --> 01:42:31,595
spondylitis and the lethargy of the organs.

214
01:42:40,930 --> 01:42:45,930
If you have done mistakes, it’s all right.

215
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:49,514
After all you are human beings, you are not God.

216
01:42:57,555 --> 01:43:00,013
And if you have done mistakes you should face them,

217
01:43:00,222 --> 01:43:04,555
instead of putting them as guilt here and torture yourself.

218
01:43:10,805 --> 01:43:13,347
In short, forgive yourself

219
01:43:13,555 --> 01:43:17,846
and be very pleasantly placed towards yourself,

220
01:43:23,263 --> 01:43:28,930
because you are going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

221
01:43:35,514 --> 01:43:40,930
This Divine Power is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

222
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:50,555
And you cannot commit any mistake

223
01:43:50,721 --> 01:43:55,846
that cannot be dissolved by this Ocean of Forgiveness.

224
01:44:05,846 --> 01:44:09,888
The third condition is also very simple.

225
01:44:13,596 --> 01:44:19,555
Third ccondition is that you have to forgive everyone.

226
01:44:25,514 --> 01:44:28,805
You have to forgive in general, you don’t have to think

227
01:44:29,013 --> 01:44:31,595
about each one of them.

228
01:44:35,763 --> 01:44:38,097
Logically,

229
01:44:38,305 --> 01:44:42,347
whether you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything.

230
01:44:47,638 --> 01:44:52,222
But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands.

231
01:44:56,514 --> 01:45:01,514
Those who have tortured you, or troubled you are happy

232
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:06,180
and you are torturing yourself on their behalf.

233
01:45:16,846 --> 01:45:21,097
So, what’s the use of not forgiving?

234
01:45:25,888 --> 01:45:31,888
Moreover, the chakra which we call as the Agnya chakra,

235
01:45:32,347 --> 01:45:35,638
in the optic chiasma,

236
01:45:35,930 --> 01:45:39,430
it's closed like this, constricted like this.

237
01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:49,971
It won’t open unless and until you forgive.

238
01:45:53,596 --> 01:45:56,596
But once you forgive it opens like this.

239
01:46:01,097 --> 01:46:03,388
You have to just say, “I forgive everyone of them.”

240
01:46:03,595 --> 01:46:06,846
Don’t even think of them, because it’s a headache.

241
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:17,514
These are the only three conditions.

242
01:46:19,971 --> 01:46:24,138
If you really accept them, it will work out very fast.

243
01:46:27,555 --> 01:46:30,595
You have to cooperate with Me.

244
01:46:35,097 --> 01:46:37,472
Now

245
01:46:38,055 --> 01:46:41,595
we have to take out our shoes. That will help us a lot,

246
01:46:41,763 --> 01:46:46,679
because this Mother Earth sucks in our problems.

247
01:47:15,596 --> 01:47:19,555
Now, they have already told you about the left and right side.

248
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:25,013
And

249
01:47:25,222 --> 01:47:28,222
as they are two powers, we have to put both the feet

250
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:30,805
little away from each other.

251
01:47:39,595 --> 01:47:44,347
You don’t have to stay in yourself, you have to be comfortable

252
01:47:44,595 --> 01:47:47,263
only thing, don’t bend yourself too much

253
01:47:47,472 --> 01:47:50,388
or don’t stretch yourself too much till I tell you.

254
01:47:56,430 --> 01:47:58,595
You have to be very comfortable.

255
01:48:01,555 --> 01:48:04,180
You don’t have to go to Himalayas for that.

256
01:48:07,763 --> 01:48:10,055
And you don’t have to suffer.

257
01:48:12,097 --> 01:48:14,305
Christ has suffered for us already.

258
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:22,721
Just have faith in yourself.

259
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:29,347
Don’t be doubts about yourself.

260
01:48:33,763 --> 01:48:38,846
I assure you, you all can get your Self Realization tonight.

261
01:48:46,721 --> 01:48:51,472
So, now we’ll show you how we’ll nourish

262
01:48:51,638 --> 01:48:54,971
our own centers, you will nourish your own centers.

263
01:49:01,305 --> 01:49:04,805
Please put your left hand towards Me like this.

264
01:49:09,097 --> 01:49:15,222
This is symbolic that you want your Self Realization,

265
01:49:15,555 --> 01:49:20,595
because left side is the power of ordinary desire.

266
01:49:30,388 --> 01:49:32,388
All of you have to do it.

267
01:49:32,595 --> 01:49:35,763
Those who don’t want to do should go away.

268
01:49:44,097 --> 01:49:48,388
Then we have the second power,

269
01:49:48,595 --> 01:49:51,222
the power of action on the right hand side,

270
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:54,679
with which we’ll be nourishing our centers.

271
01:50:04,763 --> 01:50:08,347
Third is the power of Kundalini

272
01:50:08,555 --> 01:50:12,055
which is the power of pure desire.

273
01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:22,971
So, all of you should have pure desire in your heart

274
01:50:23,180 --> 01:50:28,180
that you should all get your Self Realization.

275
01:50:35,055 --> 01:50:38,347
So, just put your left hand towards Me like this,

276
01:50:38,555 --> 01:50:45,596
very comfortably on your lap or on your legs,

277
01:50:54,097 --> 01:50:56,971
resting like this.

278
01:50:58,555 --> 01:51:01,013
Now, with the right hand we’ll be nourishing

279
01:51:01,222 --> 01:51:03,971
our centers on the left hand side.

280
01:51:08,472 --> 01:51:13,555
First we do it, we’ll show you and then we'll close our eyes

281
01:51:13,721 --> 01:51:15,971
and the process will start.

282
01:51:22,472 --> 01:51:25,595
Please put your right hand on your heart.

283
01:51:29,555 --> 01:51:35,388
This is the center where the Spirit resides.

284
01:51:41,721 --> 01:51:45,679
If you become the Spirit, in the light of the Spirit,

285
01:51:45,888 --> 01:51:48,971
you become your guide, your master.

286
01:51:55,930 --> 01:52:00,263
Then you put your hand... Please come. put your hand

287
01:52:00,430 --> 01:52:05,347
on the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

288
01:52:11,472 --> 01:52:15,263
This is the center of your mastery.

289
01:52:20,763 --> 01:52:24,305
This is being created by great prophets.

290
01:52:28,595 --> 01:52:31,097
We have to just enlighten it.

291
01:52:33,846 --> 01:52:36,472
Now, please take your right hand in the lower portion

292
01:52:36,638 --> 01:52:39,721
of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

293
01:52:42,347 --> 01:52:44,971
Lower, lower, lower here.

294
01:52:49,097 --> 01:52:51,763
This is the center

295
01:52:51,971 --> 01:52:56,721
for pure divine knowledge.

296
01:53:03,555 --> 01:53:07,679
Again we raise our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen.

297
01:53:14,097 --> 01:53:17,721
Then we raise our right hand on our heart.

298
01:53:22,595 --> 01:53:24,805
Now we raise our right hand

299
01:53:25,013 --> 01:53:27,138
in the corner of our neck and our shoulder

300
01:53:27,347 --> 01:53:29,388
and turn our head to our right.

301
01:53:35,347 --> 01:53:37,595
This is the center as I told you –

302
01:53:40,595 --> 01:53:43,888
I told you this center

303
01:53:44,097 --> 01:53:47,347
gets in trouble when you feel guilty.

304
01:53:54,180 --> 01:53:57,971
Now, please take your right hand

305
01:53:58,180 --> 01:54:02,430
on top of your forehead across and put down your head.

306
01:54:09,305 --> 01:54:14,180
This is the center where you have to ask forgiveness

307
01:54:15,595 --> 01:54:18,596
no, no, you have to forgive others, I am sorry.

308
01:54:19,055 --> 01:54:22,388
This is the center where you have to forgive others.

309
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:28,930
Now please take your right hand back side of your head

310
01:54:29,138 --> 01:54:31,305
and push back your head.

311
01:54:35,888 --> 01:54:41,721
Here. Here, without feeling guilty,

312
01:54:41,930 --> 01:54:46,222
without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction

313
01:54:46,472 --> 01:54:48,721
you have to ask forgiveness

314
01:54:48,930 --> 01:54:52,055
from the All-pervading Divine Power.

315
01:55:04,846 --> 01:55:08,805
Now, the last center which is very important.

316
01:55:11,721 --> 01:55:15,263
Please stretch your palm

317
01:55:18,638 --> 01:55:21,097
and put the center of your palm

318
01:55:21,305 --> 01:55:25,222
on top of the fontanel bone area,

319
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:27,888
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

320
01:55:35,596 --> 01:55:38,180
Now, very important is to push back your fingers,

321
01:55:38,388 --> 01:55:39,638
there is a good pressure,

322
01:55:39,846 --> 01:55:42,347
there should be a good pressure on your scalp.

323
01:55:48,888 --> 01:55:51,430
Now, please put down your head.

324
01:55:57,305 --> 01:56:03,305
Here now you have to move your scalp seven times, clockwise.

325
01:56:17,514 --> 01:56:19,595
That’s all we have to do.

326
01:56:29,596 --> 01:56:32,805
Now you have to close your eyes.

327
01:56:44,638 --> 01:56:48,180
And till I tell you please don’t open your eyes.

328
01:56:53,055 --> 01:56:55,055
Just turn it towards Me.

329
01:56:56,055 --> 01:56:58,971
Both the feet away from each other.

330
01:57:07,971 --> 01:57:11,721
Now please take out your spectacles.

331
01:57:17,222 --> 01:57:19,097
No, it doesn't work out here.

332
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:26,930
Put your right hand on your heart.

333
01:57:31,514 --> 01:57:33,555
Now it's better.

334
01:57:33,846 --> 01:57:38,596
Put it on here. Much better.

335
01:57:38,846 --> 01:57:42,971
It’s terrible, such heat I’m absorbing from all of them.

336
01:57:43,514 --> 01:57:47,097
Terrible heat they have. All right, doesn’t matter.

337
01:57:47,305 --> 01:57:50,430
Please put your right hand on your heart.

338
01:57:57,472 --> 01:58:01,679
Here now you have to ask Me a very fundamental question

339
01:58:07,721 --> 01:58:09,971
three times,

340
01:58:12,263 --> 01:58:16,971
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

341
01:58:20,595 --> 01:58:26,595
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji.

342
01:58:31,596 --> 01:58:34,222
It's better now. Little bit [strike] it more.

343
01:58:49,930 --> 01:58:52,679
I have already told you

344
01:58:52,888 --> 01:58:57,055
that if you become the Spirit

345
01:58:57,805 --> 01:59:03,805
you become your own master.

346
01:59:11,805 --> 01:59:14,180
So, now please take your hand

347
01:59:14,388 --> 01:59:18,222
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

348
01:59:25,472 --> 01:59:31,805
Here, here you have to say again another question.

349
01:59:38,846 --> 01:59:41,514
Three times please ask,

350
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:45,679
“Mother am I my own master?”

351
02:00:15,555 --> 02:00:19,222
I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom.

352
02:00:23,180 --> 02:00:27,846
And I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

353
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:34,514
You have to ask for it.

354
02:00:36,595 --> 02:00:41,555
So, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

355
02:00:41,971 --> 02:00:45,097
on the left hand side and press it hard.

356
02:00:51,472 --> 02:00:55,055
Here you have to ask six times,

357
02:00:55,263 --> 02:00:58,888
because this center has got six petals.

358
02:01:06,971 --> 02:01:10,472
Please say, “Mother,

359
02:01:10,805 --> 02:01:14,595
give me pure knowledge.

360
02:01:14,763 --> 02:01:18,638
Please Mother, give me pure knowledge.” Six times.

361
02:01:35,805 --> 02:01:39,514
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge

362
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:43,638
your Kundalini starts moving upward.

363
02:01:51,138 --> 02:01:57,138
So now, we have to nourish our higher centers

364
02:01:57,679 --> 02:02:01,388
so that Kundalini can pass easily through them.

365
02:02:07,888 --> 02:02:11,763
It has to be nourished with our self confidence.

366
02:02:15,555 --> 02:02:17,930
So, now please take your right hand

367
02:02:18,138 --> 02:02:20,930
in the upper portion of your abdomen.

368
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:32,430
And here you have to say with full confidence

369
02:02:32,638 --> 02:02:37,721
ten times, “Mother, I am my own master.”

370
02:02:37,930 --> 02:02:39,930
Please say it ten times.

371
02:03:01,222 --> 02:03:04,305
I’ve already told you that you are not this body,

372
02:03:04,514 --> 02:03:08,222
this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

373
02:03:08,472 --> 02:03:11,721
but you are pure Spirit.

374
02:03:21,805 --> 02:03:25,888
So, now please raise your right hand on your heart.

375
02:03:30,013 --> 02:03:33,595
And here

376
02:03:33,971 --> 02:03:38,013
with full confidence say twelve times,

377
02:03:38,347 --> 02:03:45,977
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit.”

378
02:04:05,615 --> 02:04:10,281
The All-pervading Divine Power is the Ocean

379
02:04:10,490 --> 02:04:14,073
of divine knowledge.

380
02:04:21,947 --> 02:04:25,906
It is the Ocean of Compassion and Bliss.

381
02:04:29,863 --> 02:04:33,365
But above all, it is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

382
02:04:36,490 --> 02:04:39,156
So whatever mistake you have committed

383
02:04:39,365 --> 02:04:43,573
can be easily dissolved by this Ocean of Forgiveness.

384
02:04:52,448 --> 02:04:56,114
So, now please raise your hand

385
02:04:56,448 --> 02:05:04,198
on to the corner of, between your neck and your shoulder,

386
02:05:04,406 --> 02:05:07,281
and turn your head to your right.

387
02:05:14,114 --> 02:05:20,782
Here now with full confidence, please say 16 times,

388
02:05:20,947 --> 02:05:24,073
“Mother, I’m not guilty at all.”

389
02:05:31,782 --> 02:05:34,782
Please turn your head to your right.

390
02:05:46,073 --> 02:05:48,656
I have already told you whether you forgive

391
02:05:48,863 --> 02:05:51,863
or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

392
02:05:57,740 --> 02:06:02,198
But you torture yourself and play into wrong hands.

393
02:06:06,863 --> 02:06:09,863
So,

394
02:06:15,740 --> 02:06:19,323
please take your right hand on top of your forehead

395
02:06:19,531 --> 02:06:22,406
and put down your head.

396
02:06:28,573 --> 02:06:33,490
Here you have to forgive everyone in general,

397
02:06:33,864 --> 02:06:37,782
not how many times, but from your heart.

398
02:06:45,031 --> 02:06:47,740
If you do not forgive

399
02:06:47,906 --> 02:06:52,156
then you will also miss your Self Realization,

400
02:06:52,365 --> 02:06:55,323
because Kundalini cannot pass

401
02:06:55,531 --> 02:06:58,448
through the constricted Agnya chakra.

402
02:07:19,239 --> 02:07:23,573
Now, please take back your hand, on the back side of your head,

403
02:07:23,782 --> 02:07:29,531
and put it up as far as possible.

404
02:07:38,863 --> 02:07:42,114
Here without feeling guilty,

405
02:07:44,615 --> 02:07:47,615
without counting your mistakes,

406
02:07:49,156 --> 02:07:53,656
for your satisfaction you have to say,

407
02:07:54,198 --> 02:07:56,239
“Oh Divine Power,

408
02:07:56,448 --> 02:08:00,947
please forgive me, if I have done any mistakes.”

409
02:08:22,239 --> 02:08:26,989
Now,  this has to be said from your heart,

410
02:08:27,198 --> 02:08:29,365
not how many times.

411
02:08:50,864 --> 02:08:54,823
Now, please stretch your palm fully.

412
02:08:59,656 --> 02:09:02,239
And put the center of your palm

413
02:09:02,448 --> 02:09:06,490
on top of the fontanel bone area.

414
02:09:11,406 --> 02:09:14,947
Push back your fingers. Why are you not doing, madam?

415
02:09:17,031 --> 02:09:20,031
Why is she not doing it? This lady.

416
02:09:24,198 --> 02:09:26,989
She wants to listen only. She only wants to listen.

417
02:09:27,198 --> 02:09:29,531
Then let her go away. She should go.

418
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:33,365
She should not try to be arrogant like that, not proper.

419
02:09:49,406 --> 02:09:54,656
All right. Now put your right hand on your fontanel bone area

420
02:09:59,406 --> 02:10:02,156
and please put down your head.

421
02:10:06,073 --> 02:10:10,656
Here now, you have to move your scalp

422
02:10:11,656 --> 02:10:15,239
seven times, clockwise.

423
02:10:16,906 --> 02:10:19,281
But here again

424
02:10:19,490 --> 02:10:25,531
I cannot force Self Realization on you.

425
02:10:36,531 --> 02:10:40,198
You have to ask for your Self Realization.

426
02:10:43,448 --> 02:10:49,239
So while moving your scalp seven times you should just say,

427
02:10:49,448 --> 02:10:52,864
“Mother, please give me my Self Realization.”

428
02:11:09,198 --> 02:11:12,698
Seven times, please.

429
02:11:19,031 --> 02:11:21,823
Litlle like that. Yes.

430
02:12:02,615 --> 02:12:05,323
Now please take down your hands.

431
02:12:16,989 --> 02:12:19,740
Put both the hands like this towards Me.

432
02:12:21,823 --> 02:12:24,740
Open your eyes.

433
02:12:26,615 --> 02:12:31,864
Watch Me. Watch Me without thinking, you can do it.

434
02:12:39,239 --> 02:12:42,406
Now please put right hand towards Me.

435
02:12:44,863 --> 02:12:48,365
And put down your head and see with your left hand

436
02:12:48,573 --> 02:12:53,615
if there is a cool or a warm breeze coming out of your head.

437
02:13:03,406 --> 02:13:06,365
You shouldn’t put your hand on top of your head,

438
02:13:09,863 --> 02:13:12,863
but away from it.

439
02:13:17,864 --> 02:13:20,863
Now please put your left hand towards Me.

440
02:13:24,698 --> 02:13:27,281
And now bend your head and see with your right hand

441
02:13:27,490 --> 02:13:29,947
if there’s a cool or a hot breeze

442
02:13:30,156 --> 02:13:33,490
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

443
02:13:44,281 --> 02:13:48,031
Now please put your right hand towards Me again

444
02:13:48,239 --> 02:13:50,864
and with the left hand you can see it again.

445
02:14:09,947 --> 02:14:14,281
Now raise both your hands towards the sky

446
02:14:17,989 --> 02:14:20,615
and ask a question

447
02:14:20,823 --> 02:14:24,573
one of these three questions, anyone of them, three times.

448
02:14:28,823 --> 02:14:32,156
Push back your head and ask the question,

449
02:14:32,406 --> 02:14:35,531
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

450
02:14:42,323 --> 02:14:45,198
Or ask the question three times,

451
02:14:45,406 --> 02:14:50,031
“Mother, is this the All-pervading Power of Divine Love?”

452
02:14:56,239 --> 02:14:58,863
Or ask the question three times,

453
02:14:59,031 --> 02:15:01,615
“Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?”

454
02:15:08,031 --> 02:15:10,323
Please take down your hands.

455
02:15:12,239 --> 02:15:14,448
It’s hot.

456
02:15:15,365 --> 02:15:21,323
All those who have felt cool breeze

457
02:15:22,281 --> 02:15:27,490
or hot breeze from their fontanel bone area

458
02:15:27,782 --> 02:15:32,365
or on their fingertips or on their palms

459
02:15:32,863 --> 02:15:35,863
please raise both your hands.

460
02:15:49,239 --> 02:15:51,863
The whole of Austria.

461
02:15:52,031 --> 02:15:55,573
May God bless you all! May God bless you! May God bless you!

462
02:16:00,531 --> 02:16:02,782
Vienna!

463
02:16:03,239 --> 02:16:08,198
I bow to you all. You have now started your saintly life.

464
02:16:13,615 --> 02:16:17,656
Now respect, respect your Self Realization.

465
02:16:21,989 --> 02:16:26,073
Sahaja Yoga is a collective happening.

466
02:16:30,989 --> 02:16:33,864
You cannot do it individually.

467
02:16:35,906 --> 02:16:38,490
Of course, at home you can meditate,

468
02:16:38,698 --> 02:16:42,239
but you have to come to collective to grow.

469
02:16:48,156 --> 02:16:51,198
Like this finger, if it is sick,

470
02:16:51,406 --> 02:16:55,323
the whole body runs for the help of this.

471
02:16:56,114 --> 02:17:00,863
In the same way now you have become the whole.

472
02:17:08,863 --> 02:17:13,031
The microcosm has become the macrocosm.

473
02:17:17,863 --> 02:17:23,281
You’ll have so many blessings and so many miracles

474
02:17:23,615 --> 02:17:26,740
that you may not believe them even.

475
02:17:34,823 --> 02:17:41,156
And you’ll be amazed how fantastically you are so glorious.

476
02:17:48,281 --> 02:17:52,281
But you must learn how to use this power.

477
02:17:56,823 --> 02:18:00,863
You’ll hardly take a month to master it.

478
02:18:06,448 --> 02:18:09,740
You don’t have to pay for this at all.

479
02:18:13,031 --> 02:18:16,823
No one is going to pay for it,

480
02:18:17,782 --> 02:18:21,239
only thing you have to give little time

481
02:18:21,573 --> 02:18:24,281
for your Self Realization.

482
02:18:32,740 --> 02:18:37,740
May God bless you all!
