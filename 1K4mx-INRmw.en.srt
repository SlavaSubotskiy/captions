00:00:01,595 --> 00:00:05,341
Hello Anne, how are you?

2
00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:12,416
Seminar in Mill Farm – Sherborne, Dorset (UK), 2 August 1981.

3
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,162
What a beautiful place we are all in.

4
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:26,858
It’s a real blessing of Sahaja Yoga for all of you to relax,

5
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:34,629
relax well. Because in relaxation only you realize that,

6
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,112
we are now realized souls.

7
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:44,641
That we have entered into the kingdom of heaven.

8
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:49,753
That we can see the beauty what God has created around us.

9
00:00:49,953 --> 00:00:52,558
That we have become sensitive to His grace

10
00:00:52,758 --> 00:00:56,891
and to His kindness and to His love.

11
00:01:05,506 --> 00:01:09,680
It’s a seminar that you have arranged and I’m very happy.

12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,063
I always wanted you to arrange seminars

13
00:01:12,263 --> 00:01:16,212
and that you all should meet together and live together,

14
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:20,249
and understand each other.

15
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:24,398
The seminars on the gross level

16
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:28,919
they work out many things no doubt.

17
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,740
But on subtler levels, seminars of the Sahaja yogis,

18
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,345
means a lot.

19
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:45,438
It means that a strong nucleus is being consolidated

20
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:49,254
in various places in a country.

21
00:01:49,454 --> 00:01:53,316
And these strongholds

22
00:01:53,516 --> 00:02:00,500
or we can say the strong nucleus which is created like this,

23
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,338
can form a mechanism by which

24
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:13,111
beams of strong vibrations could flow

25
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:16,065
or could be thrown all over the places.

26
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:25,227
It’s a very great task to build up these mechanisms,

27
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:34,204
these divine mechanisms in different parts of your country.

28
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:39,237
Please, take her out for a while.

29
00:02:44,877 --> 00:02:49,349
For example, Mother Earth has done Her job.

30
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,779
Wherever it was possible for Her, She has created

31
00:02:54,979 --> 00:03:01,389
living deities

32
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:05,643
to show that God exists.

33
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:09,455
That you can now test their vibrations and see for yourself

34
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,769
how She has worked very hard.

35
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:18,566
She has created all this beautiful universe.

36
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:23,155
She has created you also.

37
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:28,214
She has created the kundalini within you.

38
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:34,222
She represents the beautiful nature we can say.

39
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:41,247
In Her company, in Her bounties when you are drenched

40
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:45,603
and you all meet each other,

41
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:47,761
you see for yourself

42
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:52,414
that how She blesses all of you just the same.

43
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:57,266
There is no difference

44
00:03:57,466 --> 00:04:00,362
between you and any other person for Her.

45
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:03,721
But those who are sensitive, are subtler people,

46
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:09,117
enjoy Her much more than you people do.

47
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:15,283
Now the problem that exists in every country

48
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:18,471
has its own style I have seen.

49
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:23,862
And as in this country also we have a style of problems

50
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:27,914
which comes. Gradually it’s changing its form.

51
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:32,899
In the beginning I found that people were overaggressive,

52
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:40,322
sceptical and also could be rude also sometimes.

53
00:04:40,522 --> 00:04:43,720
It’s all right. Makes no difference to Me.

54
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,433
Now gradually they started changing over.

55
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:55,090
Now they are becoming aware of what they have got,

56
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,052
what role they are playing, how important it is to be an Englishman.

57
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,019
And when I say English I mean all the English people,

58
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:07,006
not Wales or anything different,

59
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:13,375
and how they have to become

60
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:17,061
part and parcel of the heart of the universe.

61
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,344
I wondered how many of you really realize

62
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:23,473
how important it is to be an Englishman.

63
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:29,110
That everything that happens in this country circulates.

64
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,807
For example if this royal wedding had taken place

65
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:37,269
in any other royal family it would not have circulated so much.

66
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:39,353
Everything circulates from this country.

67
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:41,889
Maybe you may not think much of yourself.

68
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:44,701
You may think that what is so great

69
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:48,168
after all this England is like any other country.

70
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:53,913
But you see why people accept so many things from you?

71
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:56,133
Like even a monarchy,

72
00:05:56,333 --> 00:06:01,016
I mean most of the countries have thrown away their monarchies.

73
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:06,612
And in this country it exists and it has a respectable position.

74
00:06:06,812 --> 00:06:11,368
And the symbol of a monarchy

75
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:16,880
is still lingering here in a very proud way.

76
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:19,752
Then the marriage itself,

77
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:22,022
the marriages of royal families are always detested

78
00:06:22,222 --> 00:06:26,073
and protested and nobody is interested.

79
00:06:26,274 --> 00:06:29,479
And such a auspicious thing should take place here

80
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:33,284
and that everybody should see it.

81
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:37,135
So many countries should watch it and appreciate it

82
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:40,667
and enjoy it of all the things.

83
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:44,492
It’s something surprising.

84
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:49,026
It transcends all rationality,

85
00:06:49,226 --> 00:06:53,465
all understanding of even logic

86
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,511
we can say that what is the logic behind it?

87
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:57,530
But if you are enjoying it you just enjoy.

88
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,574
You don’t want to think about it why you are enjoying.

89
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:06,870
So, one has to understand that you are part and parcel

90
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:12,180
of the heart of the universe.

91
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:17,390
One thing is essential

92
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:22,743
that you have to be very flexible people.

93
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,871
You have to have

94
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:33,033
the flexibility of the heart cells we can say.

95
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:40,440
Now heart has to pump.

96
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:46,265
It has to be strong.

97
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:50,488
And surprisingly lion is your emblem.

98
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:54,441
So you have to have a lion’s heart.

99
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,743
And lion’s heart means he is not afraid.

100
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:01,662
He is the king. He knows he’s the king and he lives like a king.

101
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:08,876
Like a lion and Leo as in astrology

102
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:14,392
or if you say is a man who is extremely generous,

103
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:16,807
lion hearted, not afraid of anyone. There should be no fear. But English language if you read anyone or if you listen to anyone, every third sentence he’ll come with the word, “I’m afraid. I’m afraid to say, I’m afraid this is so”… This word must be dropped out from the vocabulary of Sahaja yogis. What is there to be afraid of? Some people say that this is said because we do not want to hurt other people. There are so many other ways of saying things without hurting others. But what is there to be afraid of?

104
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:21,187
There should be no fear.

105
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:25,082
But English language if you read anyone

106
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:27,144
or if you listen to anyone,

107
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:30,169
every third sentence he’ll come with the word,

108
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:32,802
“I’m afraid.

109
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:36,177
I’m afraid to say, I’m afraid this is so”…

110
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:40,911
This word must be dropped out from the vocabulary of Sahaja yogis.

111
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:44,798
What is there to be afraid of?

112
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,512
Some people say that this is said because we do not want

113
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:51,071
to hurt other people. There are so many other ways

114
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:53,332
of saying things without hurting others.

115
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:56,894
But what is there to be afraid of?

116
00:08:57,094 --> 00:09:01,183
A man who is weak cannot love.

117
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:05,832
Only a strong person can love.

118
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:08,043
If you talk of love first of all see

119
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:11,045
whether you are strong enough to love or not.

120
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:14,115
Loving is not a easy thing, even carnal love,

121
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:17,635
even loving your beloved of in the ordinary sense.

122
00:09:17,835 --> 00:09:20,252
It’s not a easy thing.

123
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:25,299
You have to have a very strong moral concept,

124
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:30,604
otherwise every third minute people start changing their loves.

125
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:33,353
That kind of a love has no meaning.

126
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:42,483
You have to have a very firm ideas.

127
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:47,183
Not only ideas in your brain but built within you.

128
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:54,045
Very few people can really have a love as Romeo had,

129
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,232
I can tell you this.

130
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:59,643
It’s easy to think that you are a Romeo, it’s different.

131
00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:02,854
You can think you are you are the King of England,

132
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:06,651
it’s all right. But you don’t become that way.

133
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:10,690
So to be Romeo itself

134
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,026
you have to have a tremendous character.

135
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:22,048
A tremendous sense of sacrifice and love

136
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:26,634
and understanding of what you want.

137
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:33,343
You want to love, that’s all nothing beyond or before.

138
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:37,869
I mean a man when he falls in love

139
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,326
he falls in love forever and ever and ever.

140
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:45,736
If he falls in love many a times it cannot be love.

141
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,009
So that experience also

142
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:54,732
is sort of is a forbidden fruit for most of them.

143
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:07,686
So to love God is even more difficult,

144
00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:11,415
without seeing Him, without knowing Him,

145
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:16,118
without knowing His bounties, without getting realization.

146
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:20,143
It is very difficult.

147
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:24,820
But today that is not the case.

148
00:11:27,914 --> 00:11:32,983
But still you have to have

149
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:37,092
no fear in your mind, trust,

150
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:40,947
you trust yourself and trust others.

151
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:45,358
First of all try to trust yourself.

152
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,754
If you have made mistakes, you have to say,

153
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:53,339
“Yes, I have made mistakes, all right so what?”

154
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:56,698
Trust yourself that you can correct yourself also.

155
00:11:56,898 --> 00:12:01,406
Trusting doesn’t mean blind ego trip. It does not mean that.

156
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:05,203
Trust means that “Yes I can correct myself.

157
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:10,762
I can improve. I can do better.”

158
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:17,340
Some people think that if you trust yourself

159
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,504
then you should never confess anything that you have done wrong.

160
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:24,842
That you should never say that it was wrong and I can correct.

161
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:32,046
This is a wrong idea. You have to trust yourself by saying that,

162
00:12:32,246 --> 00:12:36,564
“Yes I have done mistakes. I have been doing wrong.

163
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:39,736
I have been faltering but I can correct.

164
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:41,759
I have that strength within me.

165
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,728
I can rise above all these things.

166
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:51,477
I have that thing within me which I can use to my advantage.”

167
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:59,514
Trust yourself. Trust that you are realized souls.

168
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:01,714
Trust that God loves you.

169
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:06,759
That He has chosen you to be His instrument.

170
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,709
Love yourself.

171
00:13:13,178 --> 00:13:16,125
You are unique no doubt.

172
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:20,719
As it is human beings, every individual is an unique person.

173
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:25,010
But after realization

174
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,468
you are definitely unique person.

175
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:37,380
It never means ego trip. One has to use

176
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,255
discretion about understanding. It never means ego trip.

177
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:47,931
If you cannot correct yourself, you are not master of yourself.

178
00:13:52,597 --> 00:13:56,683
Yes you are not perfect.

179
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:03,168
You are unique but you are not perfect. You have to perfect yourself.

180
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:08,517
These words can be very confusing. When I say you are unique

181
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:10,428
immediately, you think you are perfect.

182
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:14,784
These are two words, unique and perfect.

183
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:17,931
Somebody can be unique

184
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:21,042
but he can have imperfections.

185
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:23,901
So you have to perfect yourself.

186
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:26,878
And trust in yourself that you can perfect yourself,

187
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:30,648
through your kundalini awakening, clearing your charkas.

188
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:36,028
By understanding yourself, you can perfect yourself.

189
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:43,009
You have to perfect. I have so many ways I tell you;

190
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:47,468
directly, sometimes indirectly, through friends,

191
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:52,972
somehow point out that this is the problem with you.

192
00:14:54,732 --> 00:14:57,258
You should think that I am within you.

193
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:02,290
I am that part within you which is discretion.

194
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,219
When you do not understand your own discretion,

195
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:12,339
I try to give you the direction by this way or that way.

196
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:17,549
But people feel hurt. People feel bad

197
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:19,971
or, some of them accept it.

198
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:24,105
If you are seekers and if you are ascending,

199
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:26,824
you are definitely unique,

200
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:31,026
one specially blessed.

201
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:33,567
And you have to pay special attention to yourself.

202
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:38,181
You can’t afford to play with yourself.

203
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:46,207
So you have to discriminate between ego

204
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:51,264
or ego trips as they call it

205
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:55,230
and ascent.

206
00:15:55,958 --> 00:16:02,981
Ego trips bring you back with the worst hurting.

207
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,679
It would be something like throwing you in the air

208
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,938
and again you come back with a bump and break

209
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:13,219
one of your necks or something like that.

210
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,042
That’s what ego trip is.

211
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:20,384
But ascent is where you really rise above.

212
00:16:20,584 --> 00:16:23,306
Not only that you rise

213
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:27,137
but with you,

214
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:29,379
you make others rise.

215
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:35,704
In your ascent, you develop tremendous powers.

216
00:16:36,883 --> 00:16:39,558
The higher you ascend the better it is.

217
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:42,795
But not by understanding that I am perfect you can ascend,

218
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:46,629
never so.

219
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:54,286
There’s a story of a teacher and a student.

220
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,028
The teacher was very kind to the student

221
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:03,701
and he would come and show him his creations.

222
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:07,424
He was very kind to him.

223
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,391
And every time he would say that,

224
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:12,352
“I have done this good

225
00:17:12,552 --> 00:17:15,015
and this is the thing that I have not been able to do

226
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:18,550
so will you please tell me how to correct it?”

227
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,502
And the teacher would say, “Yes, good,

228
00:17:21,702 --> 00:17:25,709
you better correct this part, then do this.”

229
00:17:27,187 --> 00:17:32,790
And one day the student came and said, “Now this is perfect”.

230
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:38,205
He said, “You are no more student now.”

231
00:17:41,111 --> 00:17:45,546
So he said, “No more. You are not to come to me anymore.”

232
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:52,814
There was another

233
00:17:53,014 --> 00:17:58,669
student who was coming every day and correcting himself.

234
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:04,295
And he told to his teacher that,

235
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:08,487
“Today I think I can teach others but not yet perfect”.

236
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,585
He said, “All right you go and teach.”

237
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:19,084
The third one was a student who came

238
00:18:19,284 --> 00:18:25,572
and he was always trying to see what was the mistake

239
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,822
and how he has to correct and how he worked very hard,

240
00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:32,991
very assiduous, very hard working.

241
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:42,379
And he came to his teacher one day and he said, “Sir,

242
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,184
I will not trouble you anymore now”.

243
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:49,860
He said, “True. Now you take my seat.”

244
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:59,401
That is what one has to understand.

245
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:01,956
You ascend.

246
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:04,526
You will become humbler.

247
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,721
It is just the other way around people understand.

248
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:10,605
You see when they ascend they think we have achieved some special powers.

249
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:14,714
I don’t know. Suddenly self-certification starts you see.

250
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:17,151
I am very good in spirituality.

251
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:20,822
I am very high up and all that, this self-certificate starts.

252
00:19:21,023 --> 00:19:24,856
And then it can reach such a point

253
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:29,923
that suddenly you found you are on the earth again.

254
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:35,342
This kind of thing is not the way it works out.

255
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,875
Actually the people who ascend

256
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:43,856
there are certain qualities that show on them.

257
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:48,296
The first thing is your collectivity.

258
00:19:48,496 --> 00:19:52,418
How collective you are.

259
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:55,908
With how many people you can carry on.

260
00:19:56,108 --> 00:20:00,006
At how many things you can laugh.

261
00:20:01,092 --> 00:20:05,187
That is one of the biggest qualities.

262
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:08,066
The second quality is that

263
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:12,537
how much you accept another’s domination

264
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:16,450
who, cuts down your collectivity.

265
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:20,382
You must have your personality separate from everyone.

266
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:26,274
If you allow others to cut your personality,

267
00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:31,689
say for example, there is a boss and you are the,

268
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:34,382
you are the employee.

269
00:20:34,582 --> 00:20:38,469
And the boss is not realized soul and you are an realized soul.

270
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:42,403
Or maybe both are realized souls. Take it like that.

271
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:50,229
And one of them is ascending.

272
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:53,018
Then he becomes humbler, he becomes better,

273
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:58,015
there are congenial relationship, but to a point.

274
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:00,931
He will never compromise with his boss

275
00:21:01,131 --> 00:21:03,790
when it comes to his ascent, to his collectivity,

276
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,609
to his giving, to his doing things for others.

277
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:16,518
On that point he’ll never have any domination because

278
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:19,908
how much you feel responsible about yourself

279
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:24,642
is the second point.

280
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:29,167
How much you are responsible to be there,

281
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:31,817
to be a cell in the heart.

282
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:36,713
Any cell that fails, fails the heart.

283
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:46,371
Every cell in the heart has to be extremely sensitive

284
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:53,826
and extremely obedient to the Self, to the Spirit.

285
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:59,845
It has to activate, work harder when there is need,

286
00:22:00,045 --> 00:22:03,744
there emergency.

287
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:08,803
That it enjoys the most.

288
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:18,603
And no impurity should be allowed, the third point now.

289
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:26,688
As I told you first is collectivity, secondly your responsibility

290
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:29,393
and third point is purity.

291
00:22:29,593 --> 00:22:33,833
Purity of your own heart first of all,

292
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:39,857
of your own heart, about sincerity, cunningness.

293
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:45,285
As I am saying this you will be realizing that all Englishmen

294
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:50,754
believe in the contrary,

295
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:55,872
nowadays, not olden times, but nowadays.

296
00:22:56,072 --> 00:23:00,590
Clean heart, transparent, open heart.

297
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,403
Trust others.

298
00:23:03,603 --> 00:23:08,840
Talk to everyone with an open heart.

299
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,321
Trust others.

300
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:16,623
Why do you doubt? If you do not doubt yourself,

301
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:19,586
you’ll not doubt others.

302
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:22,101
What are they going to take away from you?

303
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,621
What have you got?

304
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:29,118
Nobody can take away your nose, eyes, nothing.

305
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:35,410
It’s all quite intact. It’s all nicely glued down.

306
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,098
So nothing is going to disappear.

307
00:23:40,298 --> 00:23:49,519
What are they going to hurt to a person who is a realized soul?

308
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,774
If your heart is clean,

309
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:56,780
you can see the other person clearly through and through.

310
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,875
Innocence is such a powerful thing,

311
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:04,190
such a powerful thing that even a glance

312
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:09,608
is sufficient to kill a Satan.

313
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,229
Purity of heart, actually when the heart becomes impure

314
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:20,856
the impurity flows down to other places.

315
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:26,392
It is not the other way round, is from the heart.

316
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:29,869
Many people believe that it’s the body

317
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:32,995
that becomes impure. I think it is the heart,

318
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:35,441
which becomes really impure,

319
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,683
and then it starts trickling down to the body

320
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:42,571
and then it is residual there. It settles down there.

321
00:24:46,332 --> 00:24:52,011
So have a clean open heart like a child’s heart. Open heart.

322
00:24:53,386 --> 00:24:57,279
What is there to be afraid of anyone?

323
00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:01,386
What is there not to trust anyone?

324
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:07,300
What is there to be angry with anyone?

325
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:13,022
Talk to everyone, shake hands with everyone,

326
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:17,480
be nice to everyone. On the way you find somebody’s difficulty,

327
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,849
give him a hand. If somebody cannot sit properly e.

328
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:25,872
or has a problem you try to remove the problem.

329
00:25:26,072 --> 00:25:30,541
If the person cannot stand, give the place.

330
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:35,345
Try to give from your clean heart.

331
00:25:35,545 --> 00:25:40,100
If your heart is not clean, it can never give.

332
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:47,938
Now how do you clean the heart is the subject

333
00:25:48,138 --> 00:25:50,344
which Felicity wanted me to discuss,

334
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:52,064
is how to clean the heart.

335
00:25:52,264 --> 00:25:57,439
There is no broom available for that in the supermarket.

336
00:26:00,886 --> 00:26:05,792
There are no Fairy liquids or anything to wash it down.

337
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:18,510
But there is a way.

338
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,276
Allow your heart to be drenched in your Mother’s love.

339
00:26:22,476 --> 00:26:26,281
Just allow. See how much She loves you.

340
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,770
I trust you.

341
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,714
People laugh at Me sometimes. Some of these saints

342
00:26:32,914 --> 00:26:34,926
who are supposed to be very great people,

343
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,973
they can’t understand how I trust you.

344
00:26:37,173 --> 00:26:41,030
They’d say that oh these are all lost races?

345
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:45,546
These are horrible people how do you trust them.

346
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:49,212
They are not sanyasis, they are not sadhus, they are nothing.

347
00:26:49,412 --> 00:26:52,276
They are ordinary people.

348
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:56,026
For them I mean your value is nothing.

349
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:58,035
They’ll if you go to them

350
00:26:58,235 --> 00:27:02,352
they will make you stand on your head for three months.

351
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:05,299
For three years, they may hang you on a well.

352
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:08,940
I don’t know what they will do to test you.

353
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,972
But I trusted you the day I saw you.

354
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,222
The day you came to me I trusted you.

355
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:18,776
And I worked on you from the very first day,

356
00:27:18,976 --> 00:27:23,712
knowing what you are but I trust your Spirit

357
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:27,948
that it would shine, in the same way, trust.

358
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:32,776
We laugh at others. I have seen Sahaja Yogis laugh at others;

359
00:27:32,976 --> 00:27:37,656
make fun of them when they come to Me.

360
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,840
Trust them.

361
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,376
When you will trust them, you will respect them also.

362
00:27:46,313 --> 00:27:50,597
So you have to believe

363
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:58,850
in yourself and enjoy the way

364
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,504
gently you are sweeping

365
00:28:03,704 --> 00:28:06,795
into the current of your Mother’s love.

366
00:28:06,995 --> 00:28:10,736
Just enjoy that.

367
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:17,231
Like a flower that falls into the current

368
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:23,796
and flows and enjoys all the beauties of that current.

369
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:27,640
In the same way,

370
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,226
you should enjoy.

371
00:28:33,773 --> 00:28:39,492
When that enjoyment comes into you, you will start trusting.

372
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,296
And trust your Mother.

373
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:50,192
I try many things to correct you.

374
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:54,177
But trust in one thing, that whatever I try for you

375
00:28:54,377 --> 00:28:58,116
or do anything,

376
00:28:58,316 --> 00:29:03,992
anything I may do for you it is just to clean you.

377
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:07,692
That’s My job.

378
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,039
May sometimes you might feel I am publicly saying things for you.

379
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:16,642
May be your images are being ruined by that

380
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:21,992
or whatever you may think. That’s not the way,

381
00:29:24,303 --> 00:29:30,608
is for your hitha, is for the well-being of your Spirit.

382
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:39,885
And that is the most difficult job.

383
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:47,725
With all this,

384
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:51,489
trust in your heart.

385
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:55,937
First trust yourself,

386
00:29:56,137 --> 00:29:58,422
trust others,

387
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:01,215
other Sahaja Yogis.

388
00:30:01,415 --> 00:30:03,965
Love thy neighbour as thyself. Who is your neighbour?

389
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:07,097
He is a Sahaja Yogi.

390
00:30:07,297 --> 00:30:10,297
Stand by him.

391
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:18,220
And trust your Mother.

392
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:23,493
As I have trusted you, you have to trust Me,

393
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:28,798
and it will work out.

394
00:30:30,118 --> 00:30:34,778
Open your heart to this trust.

395
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,299
You should not worry whether it would be

396
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:45,832
protocolish all right or not,

397
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:52,107
whether it would be absolutely respectable or not,

398
00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:55,380
because heart knows. Whatever your heart will do

399
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:59,096
in its genuine form will be respectable,

400
00:30:59,296 --> 00:31:04,494
because there resides your Spirit, which manifests.

401
00:31:04,694 --> 00:31:08,744
That will look after you. By outer forms,

402
00:31:08,944 --> 00:31:13,339
whatever you try is not going to work out.

403
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:18,317
It is that trust in your loving heart

404
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:20,754
that is going to work. It doesn’t matter.

405
00:31:20,954 --> 00:31:23,733
You see today she brought some flowers.

406
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:27,336
There were some supposed to be weeds according to her.

407
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:29,793
She went to the station

408
00:31:29,993 --> 00:31:33,183
and there she was taking some flowers out.

409
00:31:33,383 --> 00:31:36,715
And the station master and his wife were very sweet

410
00:31:36,915 --> 00:31:39,742
and they said, “Oh go ahead. They are only weeds you can have them.”

411
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:41,500
And they are so fragrant.

412
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,773
One of the most fragrant flowers I have ever seen.

413
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:46,884
They are just weeds.

414
00:31:47,084 --> 00:31:50,105
They do not conform to any formal flowers,

415
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:55,977
but just few flowers attached to other flowers were most fragrant.

416
00:31:57,352 --> 00:32:01,920
Love gives all the sophistication and the fragrance

417
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,057
and all the breeding that is required.

418
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:12,835
Not talking of love but really loving is the way,

419
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,772
is most enjoyable.

420
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:23,241
Today I wanted to tell you something good about Greece

421
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,510
before we start off with the Puja for about ten minutes.

422
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,531
Very interesting things have happened.

423
00:32:28,731 --> 00:32:35,647
When I went to Greece, I knew that I had to go to Greece.

424
00:32:35,897 --> 00:32:40,733
And they told me that they believed in the beginning in one Mother,

425
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:43,750
in one Primordial Mother.

426
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,054
But after sometime there were some Indo-Aryan people,

427
00:32:48,254 --> 00:32:50,281
Indo-Aryan who came down to them.

428
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:52,499
And they said, “Yes there is one Mother

429
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:54,548
but She has many aspects

430
00:32:54,748 --> 00:32:58,728
and these aspects are expressed as different Gods.”

431
00:32:58,928 --> 00:33:02,339
And then they told about all the Gods, which you know of.

432
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:05,519
But they, they later on

433
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:10,456
made them absolutely human type of Gods and they spoilt it.

434
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,574
But still there are certain things so amazing it was.

435
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:17,971
Like Athena is the name of the Goddess, the Primordial Mother.

436
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:23,465
But Athena Atha, Atha in Sanskrit means the primordial.

437
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:30,432
And they got the word from Athena. And to the water they call

438
00:33:30,632 --> 00:33:34,192
Neeru, Nero. And in Sanskrit it is Nira.

439
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:38,038
My name is at home is I am called as Nira,

440
00:33:38,238 --> 00:33:41,387
means from water.

441
00:33:46,236 --> 00:33:49,302
It’s very surprising how many words there are,

442
00:33:49,502 --> 00:33:52,746
like I said – told them about the centers. They said, “Kendro,”

443
00:33:52,946 --> 00:33:56,115
in Sanskrit it is Kendra.

444
00:33:56,315 --> 00:34:01,180
But the best was in Delphi when I went,

445
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,680
we were surprised at something they said,

446
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,449
“That it is the navel of the universe”.

447
00:34:12,535 --> 00:34:18,625
I said, “Europe is the liver and Greece is the navel.”

448
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:22,669
They showed a point that is the navel it was vibrating.

449
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:26,507
And not only that but they showed the most remarkable thing

450
00:34:26,707 --> 00:34:30,163
was that this is the mound,

451
00:34:30,363 --> 00:34:36,803
which is actually the expression of the navel is the mound

452
00:34:37,003 --> 00:34:39,349
which is actually has come out the Mother Earth

453
00:34:39,549 --> 00:34:41,489
is the one this one.

454
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:44,405
And this is actually Athena according to them.

455
00:34:44,605 --> 00:34:48,266
This is that has come out of the Mother Earth.

456
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:51,298
I saw the vibrations were tremendous.

457
00:34:51,498 --> 00:34:54,462
And next to that there were lot of vibrations coming

458
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:57,980
so I turned round and what I find? Is a Ganesha,

459
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:05,092
absolute Ganesha there sitting down with a beautiful trunk,

460
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:10,103
the face and the ears and the eyes, and the stomach!

461
00:35:10,303 --> 00:35:12,104
Can you believe it?

462
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:16,268
Sitting next to Her and absolutely the vibrations coming.

463
00:35:16,468 --> 00:35:19,778
I mean I didn’t have a photograph I mean camera or anything

464
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:21,559
otherwise I would have taken a photograph

465
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:23,858
but now if you go and you can see.

466
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:27,787
Another thing is they showed the egg, just imagine,

467
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:32,599
and the eternal egg from where the other eggs come out you see!

468
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:36,037
And the eggs are shown divided the same way into spindles

469
00:35:36,237 --> 00:35:40,176
as they do which doctors know they have seen under microscope.

470
00:35:40,376 --> 00:35:44,754
But how did they see, those Greeks? God only knows.

471
00:35:44,954 --> 00:35:47,940
But there’s another side to it.

472
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,538
First they use to get Amruta. t.

473
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:55,819
Is the one that was meant for the Gods

474
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:59,007
by which they were given eternal life

475
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:03,952
in the sense they were appointed as permanent features you see.

476
00:36:04,152 --> 00:36:08,176
But then the same thing they wanted everybody to have

477
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:11,723
so they started using some that was called as ambrosia.

478
00:36:11,923 --> 00:36:14,059
They converted into something else

479
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,478
and they started calling it Ambrosia

480
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:19,814
and some sort of a LSD business.

481
00:36:20,014 --> 00:36:22,425
So also, they went into trance

482
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:26,667
so the rest of it is all supra-conscious.

483
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:30,031
And that supra-conscious also side by side exists.

484
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:33,234
Now discretion has to be used

485
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:37,431
how around reality always supra-conscious

486
00:36:37,631 --> 00:36:42,880
or collective subconscious works out, one way or the other.

487
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,106
And you have to go to the point where the reality exists.

488
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:49,606
But what happens you get lost into the supra-conscious

489
00:36:49,806 --> 00:36:53,633
or you get lost into the superego or we can say the,

490
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:56,977
the collective subconscious area.

491
00:36:57,177 --> 00:36:59,341
So you see both things are to be found out,

492
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:01,571
Like an Indian temple, you go,

493
00:37:01,771 --> 00:37:04,773
you’ll find all surrounded by collective subconscious.

494
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,244
Too much ritualism, ritualistic,

495
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:09,681
ritualism takes them to the left side.

496
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:17,895
With that they go to the problem of getting all these women

497
00:37:18,095 --> 00:37:22,387
who get spirits, they go on, “hoohoohoo” before the deities,

498
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:28,025
and then they tell the name of the horse and all those things.
