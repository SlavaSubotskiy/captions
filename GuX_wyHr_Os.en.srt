00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:43,977
Sahasrara Puja – “The Ghost of Materialism”
3rd May 1987

2
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:45,208
Thredbo, Australia

3
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:53,786
Today is a very great day for all the Sahaja
yogis.

4
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:19,869
It was a long time back that I desired Sahasrara
should be opened out, but waiting for a right

5
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:21,749
time.

6
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:37,879
It was important to do it at the right time.

7
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:50,278
A boy in Aurangabad, quite young, asked Me
a question, “Mother, this all-pervading

8
00:13:50,278 --> 00:14:05,299
Power of Brahmachaitanya is beyond senses,
you cannot feel it through senses.

9
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:13,368
How is it we are now feeling it through our
senses?”

10
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:19,859
This is the question he asked, and I ask you
the same question.

11
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:35,399
Before this, those people who got realization
could not talk about it in the way you can

12
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,139
tell people, that you can feel it on your
senses.

13
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:49,689
They could not explain, they could not put
it into experience.

14
00:14:49,689 --> 00:15:07,538
Just what they did was to tell them in words,
words which were telling about something – like

15
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:14,738
the taste of mango, unless and until you eat
the mango how will you know the taste?

16
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:19,648
By just knowing about “it’s wonderful,
it’s great, it’s fantastic,” still you

17
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:26,868
have not tasted the mango.

18
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:32,969
So what has happened now, was the question.

19
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:38,148
Another thing was that these people got so
fed up, like Gyaneshwara at the age of twenty-one,

20
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:41,539
he took a samadhi.

21
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:50,219
He went into a room and closed the doors and
settled down there, and he died there.

22
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:55,919
All of them – even Christ got Himself crucified.

23
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:07,329
Because they could tell a parable, they could
tell a simile, but what had happened to them

24
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:20,410
that they could not explain, and they felt
so sad and so frustrated.

25
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:25,249
In a way they finished their life very early.

26
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:36,809
This was the question.

27
00:16:36,809 --> 00:17:11,659
So what was the secret, can any one of you
tell Me?

28
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:28,409
The answer is simple, but it’s difficult
to digest.

29
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:42,709
The answer is that all these incarnations
who came on this Earth were part of the Sahasrara,

30
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:54,388
were part of the Brahmachaitanya, were part
of the Adi Shakti.

31
00:17:54,388 --> 00:18:03,749
They came on this Earth, gave realization
to some people who were excellent, good people

32
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:11,229
who had no problems; as if they came out of
the ocean of love and took all of them to

33
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:15,999
the ocean of love, to enjoy that ocean.

34
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:21,649
As Kabira has said that “When a drop becomes
the ocean, what can I say?”

35
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:29,399
(“Jub mast hue, phir kya bole?”)

36
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,649
So many of them took to mauna, that is silence.

37
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:44,659
They disappeared, they got dissolved completely
into the ocean of love.

38
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:53,149
But you did not get dissolved.

39
00:18:53,149 --> 00:19:05,568
Something special has happened to you, that
the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole ocean

40
00:19:05,568 --> 00:19:22,189
has taken the form of a cloud – that’s
Adi Shakti – and has come on this Earth

41
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:44,198
to shower the chaitanya on you people, enrich
you, nurture you, develop you, by manifesting

42
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:55,239
the love in such a manner that you have entered
into the body of the Adi Shakti.

43
00:19:55,239 --> 00:20:00,939
So like one pitcher which is in the River
Ganges, you are like a cell in the body of

44
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:06,318
the Adi Shakti.

45
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:10,019
Your entity, your personality is preserved.

46
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:19,939
Despite that you feel the Brahmachaitanya
through your senses and you can give realizations

47
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:23,848
to others, but you are in the body of the
Adi Shakti.

48
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:33,039
As long as you are in the body of Adi Shakti
you can do all that.

49
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,478
This is the greatest thing that has happened.

50
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:43,649
The whole of the Sahasrara has opened out
with all the seven peethas of all the deities,

51
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:45,969
who are just part and parcel of it.

52
00:20:45,969 --> 00:20:58,059
The whole of it has come in the form of a
Mother who is humble, who is deceptive, illusive,

53
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:02,299
who is Mahamaya.

54
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:12,399
It’s the greatest thing that could happen
to human beings and to the whole universe,

55
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:20,539
that now you can get your realization, you
can give realizations to others, you can understand

56
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:28,279
through your senses, through your logic what
is vibrations, what it does.

57
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:40,019
Just like the proof is here: all the flowers
were dead last night, finished with the heat

58
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:41,969
of the people who were carrying them.

59
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:49,089
And then I just put some vibrated water on
them, and you see how they are.

60
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:58,139
Brahmachaitanya has revived them, but their
personality is there, they are all vibrated,

61
00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:00,998
and they are looking so fresh and beautiful.

62
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:11,659
Same thing with you, you all look so fresh
and beautiful, anybody can make out a Sahaja

63
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:12,989
yogi.

64
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:19,199
Under these circumstances one has to understand
that there are certain limitations which you

65
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,419
have to observe.

66
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:24,118
First of all, I have taken you in My body.

67
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:36,238
A foreign thing has to go in the body and
it has to be looked after, nurtured.

68
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:47,389
But if you become troublesome, then you’ll
be thrown out, I can’t bear you.

69
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:51,969
Some people are extremely troublesome.

70
00:22:51,969 --> 00:23:01,849
They do not meditate, they have their own
ideas about meditation, they do not develop

71
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:14,659
themselves, they do not mature, they live
in the past or in the future, and such people

72
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:15,659
are troublesome.

73
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:23,169
A simple thing I’d requested you all, to
put some ghee in the nose, which is a very

74
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:26,039
simple thing but is very important.

75
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:37,019
You all suffer from a very bad Hamsa, and
one of the things that is a symptom in a AIDS

76
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:39,919
case is a bad Hamsa.

77
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:53,779
You’ll be vulnerable to AIDS – and a small
thing like that is not observed.

78
00:23:53,779 --> 00:24:03,089
It has to be a religious obligation that you
must listen to Me, whatever I say.

79
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:06,129
Actually you must obey Me.

80
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:15,289
My hand obeys Me, My fingers obey Me, My feet
obey Me; what about you, who are raised to

81
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:32,169
the great dignity and the great position of
being the yogis in the body of the Adi Shakti,

82
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:46,389
and they are acting as cells in My body?

83
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:55,229
First and foremost thing is, to do this kind
of a venture, to put all kinds of things in

84
00:24:55,229 --> 00:25:15,769
your body is a very daring thing, and the
process is also very hazardous.

85
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:32,469
This has to be achieved with great patience,
love, compassion and above all, hard labor.

86
00:25:32,469 --> 00:25:42,358
This has to be regarded as the greatest thing,
that Sahasrara was opened by Me.

87
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:51,599
Of course I am the master of Sahasrara, I
am the master of all the chakras, but also

88
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,558
I’m beyond Sahasrara, much beyond it.

89
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:04,418
If that is the situation, you should be careful
about your Sahasrara – that is Me – and

90
00:26:04,418 --> 00:26:14,469
looking after your own heart which is the
Brahmarandra peetha here, which opens out

91
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:18,168
ultimately when you get your realization.

92
00:26:18,168 --> 00:26:27,199
Sahaja Yoga is spreading everywhere horizontally;
vertically it must also spread.

93
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:35,449
And there, if you really have proper understanding
of what I am, Sahasrara should be absolutely

94
00:26:35,449 --> 00:26:36,858
clearcut.

95
00:26:36,858 --> 00:26:45,139
And to keep Sahasrara clearcut you must listen
to whatever I have told you, obey it as absolutely

96
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:54,688
a ordained thing.

97
00:26:54,688 --> 00:26:58,529
To keep the Sahasrara clean is to open your
heart.

98
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:06,558
If your hearts are not open, how will I fill
it up with My love?

99
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:12,019
Open your heart to your fellow yogis and yoginis.

100
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:18,759
Don’t get worried about what has happened
in the past, don’t get worried about what

101
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:25,808
has happened in your life as far as your relationships
are concerned.

102
00:27:25,808 --> 00:27:32,329
Such things won’t happen now in Sahaja Yoga,
they cannot happen.

103
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:38,438
It has been worked out that way, it cannot
happen.

104
00:27:38,438 --> 00:27:43,259
If this hand is paining, the other hand is
there to help it out.

105
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:48,909
You’re not alone, you are in the body of
the collective being.

106
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:57,428
If there are stupid people, if there are idiotic
people, Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such

107
00:27:57,428 --> 00:28:03,959
people – in Sanskrit language they are called
as “mudhahs.”

108
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:12,699
Neither this is meant for people who are over-smart
and trying to cheat themselves – intelligence

109
00:28:12,699 --> 00:28:24,928
has that capacity – and to indulge into
things which are not Sahaj.

110
00:28:24,928 --> 00:28:29,488
Slowly you will find your vibrations will
disappear, you’ll become sick, you’ll

111
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:37,409
have problems and you’ll be in trouble.

112
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:49,569
This is not a kind of a warning but a request,
because you are in My body, and whenever

113
00:28:49,569 --> 00:29:00,019
anybody tries to be troublesome in My body
I have to bear it up, and suffer a lot.

114
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:10,769
It’s a funny type of a crucifixion when
every moment you are hanged onto a cross by

115
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:17,099
anyone who wants to do it.

116
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:26,109
Sahaja yogis have all the laws in their hands
to torture My life, to trouble Me if they

117
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:38,868
want to; but they have also such a capacity,
such a caliber, such a potential that they

118
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:43,579
can reside in My heart forever.

119
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:49,869
Open your hearts, that’s the thing I will
say.

120
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:55,289
Now we have to see what keeps our hearts closed.

121
00:29:55,289 --> 00:30:05,149
Firstly it keeps our heart in a binding, the
fear of the past.

122
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:13,219
In the past if you have done anything wrong,
in the past we have had bad experiences of

123
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:16,549
people, we are very frightened.

124
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:25,859
I’ve seen, I’m surprised, I’ve seen
it Myself that in England when we were staying

125
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:35,829
– it was that day unluckily or luckily it
was snowing for the first time, and we were

126
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:38,269
shifting, so I had gone out.

127
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:46,698
And when I came back I saw a lady and a little
baby in a pram, standing at the door and talking

128
00:30:46,698 --> 00:30:47,698
to some lady.

129
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:55,549
The other lady was just talking through a
little opening in the door, because there

130
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:57,458
was a chain on.

131
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:05,179
Then I went out and came back after half-an-hour,
and I saw the same thing.

132
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:11,338
The lady was still standing in the snow, and
this lady was talking to her through a chink.

133
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:13,809
I was surprised.

134
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:19,109
What is this going like “Midsummer’s Night’s
Dream,” these people are talking to each

135
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:22,359
other – horrible!

136
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:28,389
What was it that was frightening to this lady
inside the room – what this lady would have

137
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:31,569
done with the child, who had come to her door?

138
00:31:31,569 --> 00:31:35,319
What was there to be so frightened of?

139
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:42,718
Because of the ego within yourself: you have
frightened others, you have tortured others,

140
00:31:42,718 --> 00:31:50,399
you have dominated others, you have done all
these things, so there is fear in your mind

141
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:55,379
that others may do the same thing to you.

142
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:59,639
Or what is there to be so much frightened,
to lock your doors to everyone who comes to

143
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:04,789
your house?

144
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:12,509
Secondly, maybe you might have been tortured
by someone or troubled by someone, so your

145
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:16,249
heart is closed, you can’t open heart to
others.

146
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:20,479
People just don’t talk, they just keep “mum.”

147
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:22,919
What has happened?

148
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,179
Just like a dead body moving about.

149
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:37,308
Supposing I was like this, who would have
told you the secrets of Sahaja Yoga and Sahasrara?

150
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:43,849
So this kind of a nature comes from people
who are frightened in the past perhaps, or

151
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:50,889
they might have frightened people with their
bad Vishuddhi.

152
00:32:50,889 --> 00:32:59,799
Aggressiveness is one of the qualities in
the West, and that also is inherited by you

153
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:00,979
people.

154
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:05,359
As soon as you put them onto something, they
become aggressive.

155
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,039
I can’t bear it within Myself.

156
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:17,948
Supposing I have some sort of a medicine that
makes some cells very aggressive, then what

157
00:33:17,948 --> 00:33:18,948
happens?

158
00:33:18,948 --> 00:33:22,578
Ultimately I become a patient of cancer.

159
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:35,889
An aggressive cell is called as the malignant
cell, and such a cell cannot give you proper

160
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:43,719
attention, cannot give you proper depth, but
you become nothing but a malignant cell, a

161
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:48,089
cell which is creating a cancer.

162
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:52,489
And such a person creates cancer among Sahaja
yogis.

163
00:33:52,489 --> 00:34:02,629
I’ve heard horrible stories about how some
women, some men have become aggressive.

164
00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:07,099
With a little position they get, immediately
they become aggressive.

165
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:16,349
Say somebody is a wife of a organizer, or
a so-called leader’s, then she thinks she

166
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:25,509
is nothing but a prime minister or something
– or her husband becomes something.

167
00:34:25,509 --> 00:34:31,069
This aggressiveness adds to the aggressiveness
of another person.

168
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,889
So then reaction starts.

169
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:37,189
One says something, the another says something;
we become reactionaries.

170
00:34:37,189 --> 00:34:42,619
We haven’t got something of our own, that
we should be reactionaries?

171
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:50,729
There should be no reaction to anything, because
we have something of our own.

172
00:34:50,729 --> 00:34:56,908
Why should we react to something, whatever
people are doing to us or have done to us?

173
00:34:56,908 --> 00:34:58,338
– it’s finished.

174
00:34:58,338 --> 00:35:00,479
Open your hearts.

175
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:07,139
That’s why when you came to India, I think
you must have noticed that in the Indian heart

176
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:17,578
there is nothing like an anger for say, for
English or for Portuguese, or for anybody

177
00:35:17,578 --> 00:35:19,909
who has dominated them.

178
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:27,029
They have so much love and affection and respect,
and they see that what good you have done

179
00:35:27,029 --> 00:35:28,179
to them.

180
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:35,819
Like some barristers came to India and they
visited some high courts, and they had holiday

181
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:47,159
for one day to celebrate the visit of these
British lawyers and barristers.

182
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:55,719
But if you go to England they will beat you,
throw you out.

183
00:35:55,719 --> 00:36:01,989
This aggressiveness has to go from your heart,
it has to get out of it.

184
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:10,859
There’s no place in My body for aggressive
people, no place at all.

185
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:19,389
I have not aggressed you, and you shouldn’t
aggress Me.

186
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:23,799
If you aggress any Sahaja yogi, you are aggressing
Me.

187
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:27,579
But when it comes to others, they won’t
aggress others.

188
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:35,838
Like a bad husband will aggress his wife,
but not other people.

189
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:39,609
So those who are non-Sahaja yogis, they do
not aggress them.

190
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:48,208
That’s a very important part of Sahasrara,
because ego covers a great part of Sahasrara,

191
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:56,958
and if your Sahasrara is covered with this
ego business, how can I help you and how can

192
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:58,869
I help Myself?

193
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:12,359
Now so many of you are in My body, just imagine,
circulating fast; and most of them are fighting

194
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:16,119
to be in My heart, but they are settling in
My ego.

195
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:25,389
Well, I am egoless, because I have no reactions.

196
00:37:25,389 --> 00:37:28,409
If you have no reaction you cannot develop
ego.

197
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:33,129
I’ve no reactions, I’m reactionless.

198
00:37:33,129 --> 00:37:49,109
I am in My own peace and glory, trying to
work out Sahaja Yoga.

199
00:37:49,109 --> 00:38:02,619
I do not react to anything, but your reactions
trouble Me because you are within Me.

200
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:09,479
Then the second part is the fear that comes
from childhood.

201
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:18,019
I do not know about Americans, but so many
Americans who came to Me were half-mad, cracked

202
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:23,289
people, absolutely cracked in the head, nothing
normal about them.

203
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:27,989
Either they will not talk – if they talk
they talk irrelevantly, you don’t know what

204
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:29,429
they are talking about.

205
00:38:29,429 --> 00:38:31,600
Same with the French.

206
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:41,849
French were mad much before anybody was mad
in this world, I think; very cracky people

207
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:49,649
you see, very difficult, it’s absolutely
can’t understand, everything upside-down.

208
00:38:49,649 --> 00:39:00,919
When you blame our Indian telephone, you must
know they were made by French.

209
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:10,989
I always say that in Pune we have got the
telephone just to see, because it is called

210
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:17,080
as “Punya Patnam” – means the, is the
“city of punyas” – and only God can

211
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:25,169
listen to this telephone, but even God cannot!

212
00:39:25,169 --> 00:39:36,039
So this kind of a crackedness, or this what
you call this madness, aggressive madness,

213
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:51,669
comes from ego going to the level of super-ego;
and they get first of all “what’s wrong?”

214
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:58,468
When they talk you feel they are fighting,
and these are love talks, “romantic” they

215
00:39:58,468 --> 00:40:02,359
say, and we feel they are fighting.

216
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:11,208
And then after some time the aggressiveness
is very apparent, and then it becomes as if

217
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:15,899
they are off their heads, absolutely off their
heads.

218
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:20,159
And it’s very common with Americans, very
common.

219
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:29,829
You can’t find Americans when they are talking,
any good speaker, who doesn’t have twitches

220
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:36,468
on his faces, on his body, everywhere, because
so many nerves have been already strained

221
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:50,239
with this kind of “what’s wrong?” business
– going to the other extreme of deciding

222
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,729
everything for yourself.

223
00:40:52,729 --> 00:41:07,838
And the thing behind is a ghost, I should
say, a very big ghost, and which is not in

224
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:11,349
the past or the future, but in the present.

225
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:13,468
And that ghost I call it as materialism.

226
00:41:13,468 --> 00:41:24,649
Materialism – it’s a ghost, it’s a horrible
devil that has come onto the heads of Americans,

227
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:30,799
and from them to all of us.

228
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:35,269
This materialism is a horrible stuff.

229
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:48,659
It’s so ridiculous, shameful, doesn’t
even suit a human person; even a dog would

230
00:41:48,659 --> 00:42:01,099
hate such a materialism, to what level human
beings have gone.

231
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:07,568
This materialism makes a person absolutely
shameless.

232
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:18,299
A lady would not mind asking another lady,
“By the way, have you got my spoons with

233
00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:19,299
you?”

234
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:23,019
There’s no shame in it.

235
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:33,759
When we were small we were told in India – I
mean, that’s our culture – that if somebody’s

236
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:41,889
pin is in your house you should preserve it
and return it, but even if your diamond is

237
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:45,338
lost with somebody, never ask for it.

238
00:42:45,338 --> 00:42:50,609
Is not good manners.

239
00:42:50,609 --> 00:43:01,229
What is more valuable is not the diamond,
is the relationship, is the friendship, and

240
00:43:01,229 --> 00:43:05,779
the emotions of human beings to be respected.

241
00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:07,779
How can you ask?

242
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:12,139
If there was a diamond they would have found
it and would have given it to you, but if

243
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:19,239
there is no asking for that or reporting like
that then it’s sure there’s no diamond;

244
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:20,808
and even if it is there, doesn’t matter.

245
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:29,399
After all, what is a diamond? – you are
wearing or they are wearing, what does it

246
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:30,399
matter?

247
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:36,622
In My father’s house all the doors were
open all the time, all the doors, day and

248
00:43:36,622 --> 00:43:37,622
night.

249
00:43:37,622 --> 00:43:43,269
Never a thief came in, thought that doors
are open so nothing is locked, there’s nothing

250
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:44,269
precious.

251
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:53,068
Only we had one theft, and the thief came
and took away a gramophone from us, and some

252
00:43:53,068 --> 00:43:54,068
records.

253
00:43:54,068 --> 00:43:56,399
So My father said, “He’s a connoisseur.

254
00:43:56,399 --> 00:43:59,809
He took the right thing from this house, so
let it be.

255
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:08,389
What’s the use of informing the police?”

256
00:44:08,389 --> 00:44:20,849
So this materialism that comes in is a mad,
mad, mad dog, and gives you a disease which

257
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:25,529
is worse than any disease that is possible.

258
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:34,269
How people play on it, on this disease, as
you must have known that doctors when you

259
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:39,169
get some disease little bit, they’ll take
out your teeth, take out your eyes, take out

260
00:44:39,169 --> 00:44:44,819
your nose, take out your purse and take out
everything that you have, for a little thing

261
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:47,929
like malaria or something.

262
00:44:47,929 --> 00:44:56,909
But this disease takes away everything that
is beautiful within you, that is good within

263
00:44:56,909 --> 00:44:58,219
you.

264
00:44:58,219 --> 00:45:02,429
For example, it started a fashion.

265
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:05,229
With this materialism they start fashions.

266
00:45:05,229 --> 00:45:09,739
Ladies are more vulnerable.

267
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:17,619
Fashion starts, any sort of fashion starts,
like the sleeves to be made long – in India

268
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:25,249
also they started – then make it short,
then make it half, then make it no sleeves.

269
00:45:25,249 --> 00:45:27,019
I said, “I am not running that race.

270
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:32,188
I will have the sleeves all the time, same
sleeves so I don’t have to bother.

271
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:37,989
I can tell My tailor and he can make whatever
way I want to have, the tailor, because he

272
00:45:37,989 --> 00:45:43,239
knows I make one style” – finished with
it.

273
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:46,539
Why do people want to run with the fashion?

274
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:53,299
Just think of it, what is the need to run
with the fashion?

275
00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:56,049
Now new race has started, run with it.

276
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:58,889
Then another race has started, run with it.

277
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:03,849
Then the third race has started, run with
it – all the time running with the mad race

278
00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:08,718
of fashions.

279
00:46:08,718 --> 00:46:15,769
Now a new race has started of fashions not
to put any oil in the head, so you become

280
00:46:15,769 --> 00:46:18,169
bald, then you buy wigs.

281
00:46:18,169 --> 00:46:24,359
It’s all entrepreneurs who are working out,
it’s all enterprises.

282
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:36,369
So you become absolutely bald-headed people,
then you get your wigs from them, then there

283
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:40,909
is a special charge for dressing the wigs,
so you go for dressing the wigs.

284
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:44,279
Goes on like mad.

285
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:56,319
Then there’s another type: now a new fashion
has started in London because, you see, these

286
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,339
people want to make some money.

287
00:46:58,339 --> 00:47:03,889
People don’t even have so much of logic
and intelligence left in their heads to see

288
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:08,589
that what they were preaching one day, they
are just the thing against it.

289
00:47:08,589 --> 00:47:15,089
Formerly it was you had to wear a tail coat,
you had to have your hair absolutely done

290
00:47:15,089 --> 00:47:21,879
with proper hair-grooming and all that, as
you can see in the old pictures.

291
00:47:21,879 --> 00:47:27,089
Then it started striped three-piece suits.

292
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:36,469
Now it is, I mean, few days earlier was tight
clothes, then they developed varicose veins,

293
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:37,499
you see.

294
00:47:37,499 --> 00:47:43,179
So no, no – now it is the fashion to wear
absolutely loose dresses.

295
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:48,999
I saw the other day one lady making a dress
out of a big blanket, going like this.

296
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:57,479
I thought she was some priest or someone!

297
00:47:57,479 --> 00:48:00,699
So that stupidity has started.

298
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:10,799
Imagine – think of Sahasrara, think of Divine,
in what world we are, and in what world the

299
00:48:10,799 --> 00:48:14,759
stupid people are going.

300
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:22,939
That’s another world, absolutely another
stupid world where people just go after nonsensical

301
00:48:22,939 --> 00:48:29,499
things, changing from one to another, changing
from everything: ties are changed, everything

302
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:31,549
is changed, giving you such a headache.

303
00:48:31,549 --> 00:48:34,429
All the time you have to think, “Now what
fashion is there?

304
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:36,659
Let’s find out in the newspaper.

305
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:38,199
What is – this is the fashion now.

306
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:41,099
All right, wear this dress.”

307
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:46,369
All this is befooling going on, because this
ghost has entered into us.

308
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:57,159
In Sahaja Yoga also when we enter, be careful,
materialism should not enter into your minds.

309
00:48:57,159 --> 00:49:03,079
It’s nothing important.

310
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:08,969
Even when somebody dies you are supposed to
wear something black, or white or I don’t

311
00:49:08,969 --> 00:49:11,399
know what else, but white or black.

312
00:49:11,399 --> 00:49:19,219
And somebody died in England who was a great
friend of My husband, and I had no black sari,

313
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:20,219
completely black.

314
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:22,219
I mean we don’t have such a sari.

315
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:23,669
I didn’t know what to do.

316
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,819
I told My husband I don’t have a black sari.

317
00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:28,289
He said, “Then You don’t come.”

318
00:49:28,289 --> 00:49:34,029
Imagine how his wife would feel if I don’t
go to the thing, how she would take it.

319
00:49:34,029 --> 00:49:41,309
All this is nothing, what is important is
the black sari!

320
00:49:41,309 --> 00:49:49,089
In every walk of life you are being befooled
by this materialism.

321
00:49:49,089 --> 00:49:54,949
I don’t know how you got stuck into it first
of all.

322
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:57,819
And the other side is, the same people are
befooling you.

323
00:49:57,819 --> 00:50:03,929
“All right, this is not good, this is too
much” – so go to the anti-culture.

324
00:50:03,929 --> 00:50:09,769
What is anti-culture is another kind of materialism,
another kind of nonsense.

325
00:50:09,769 --> 00:50:16,569
Nowadays they are having in this London an
anti-culture movement which is called as “punks.”

326
00:50:16,569 --> 00:50:23,199
I think out of date now Me, but still what’s
for the time being as I see is punks.

327
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:26,709
It costs them forty pounds sometimes to make
that hair.

328
00:50:26,709 --> 00:50:35,519
I mean, is it something that you are saving
money on that?

329
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:42,779
So the whole thing works out just to take
out your attention from reality, from higher

330
00:50:42,779 --> 00:50:51,289
values, to something nonsensical.

331
00:50:51,289 --> 00:51:00,059
In Sahaja Yoga also people must learn to lead
a life of collectivity.

332
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:07,299
It’s very important that we have to be collective.

333
00:51:07,299 --> 00:51:13,449
We shouldn’t talk of “This is mine, this
is mine, and this I own.”

334
00:51:13,449 --> 00:51:18,679
Even about children you should not do like
that, “This is my own child, this is my

335
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:19,889
own baby.

336
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:28,309
This is my brother, this is my sister.”

337
00:51:28,309 --> 00:51:33,819
This “my, my” should go away; but that’s
not possible, it’s not easy to forget about

338
00:51:33,819 --> 00:51:39,409
it because left Nabhi and right Nabhi has
to be all right.

339
00:51:39,409 --> 00:51:45,649
The only way to do it is that “Mother, it’s
all Yours.”

340
00:51:45,649 --> 00:51:51,999
It’s not dangerous to say that, because
I’ll never take anything that is supposed

341
00:51:51,999 --> 00:51:55,859
to be yours.

342
00:51:55,859 --> 00:52:00,589
Just to say, “Mother, it’s all Yours,”
to start it – “It’s all Yours.

343
00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:08,599
I am Yours, my heart is Yours, all my things
are Yours, my life is Yours.”

344
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:13,729
Even saying that is a big mantra for Sahasrara.

345
00:52:13,729 --> 00:52:22,799
The deity of Sahasrara is a very simple person,
extremely simple, and can be moved with very

346
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:28,519
little actions, can be pleased with very few
little actions here and there.

347
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:32,029
Not much is needed to please the deity of
Sahasrara.

348
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:42,349
It’s a very simple person; little things
make Her happy.

349
00:52:42,349 --> 00:52:48,029
Yesterday you had brought the flowers, and
I didn’t take them.

350
00:52:48,029 --> 00:52:51,759
You all must have thought, “What’s it,
we couldn’t give flowers to Mother, holding

351
00:52:51,759 --> 00:52:52,909
in our hand.”

352
00:52:52,909 --> 00:52:58,099
But I wanted to show this miracle to you,
that’s why I didn’t take.

353
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:03,979
And I took it in the end, and see now they
are the best among all of them; don’t they

354
00:53:03,979 --> 00:53:09,899
look as if they have been plucked from the
tree?

355
00:53:09,899 --> 00:53:15,999
Just I wanted to show this, so I said, “I’m
tired,” I sat down and then I looked at

356
00:53:15,999 --> 00:53:24,379
you with the flowers, you see, in the hands,
you’re sitting all of you!

357
00:53:24,379 --> 00:53:33,989
So She is Leela Vinodini.

358
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:42,519
She plays around, makes little mischiefs here
and there for you to learn lessons.

359
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:49,179
Because if I tell you “Do this” then it’s
not possible, but little circuitous way I

360
00:53:49,179 --> 00:53:52,909
can show you that this is wrong, you should
not do it.

361
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:58,789
There’s nothing to feel bad, I would have
taken all the flowers; but somebody must have

362
00:53:58,789 --> 00:54:02,419
thought of it, why Mother has not taken the
flowers today.

363
00:54:02,419 --> 00:54:10,739
I don’t know if you thought of it or not,
but I knew it Myself that I have to take the

364
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:16,169
flowers to show this miracle to them, that
these flowers are going to last much longer

365
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:23,589
than any other flowers, because they are vibrated
with the Brahmachaitanya.

366
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:28,629
And the water was very, very, very cold, so
even I opened a hot water tap.

367
00:54:28,629 --> 00:54:37,479
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, they didn’t
die, despite that they are perfectly all right.

368
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:44,299
So you have seen so many miracles of this
Brahmachaitanya which is showing on your photographs,

369
00:54:44,299 --> 00:54:51,939
on so many your lives, in so many changes
that have taken place within yourself, within

370
00:54:51,939 --> 00:54:56,139
your family, within every one of you.

371
00:54:56,139 --> 00:55:00,519
All this has happened because you are in Brahmachaitanya.

372
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:06,779
All this you are receiving because you are
blessed by Brahmachaitanya.

373
00:55:06,779 --> 00:55:12,069
But others are not, so your attitude should
be towards them that they are in the other

374
00:55:12,069 --> 00:55:15,449
world – what to do, how to help them?

375
00:55:15,449 --> 00:55:21,489
We should try to help them if possible, but
up to a point.

376
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:23,959
We should not drag down ourselves for others’
sake.

377
00:55:23,959 --> 00:55:30,149
Up to a point only we can help them, and we
have to be very happy that Sahaja Yoga is

378
00:55:30,149 --> 00:55:33,639
spreading so much horizontally.

379
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:38,329
But for vertical thing we must know our quality
must improve.

380
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:43,149
If some people rise higher, others will also
start rising with them.

381
00:55:43,149 --> 00:55:50,329
It’s the absolute honesty of purpose should
be there, absolutely understanding should

382
00:55:50,329 --> 00:55:52,859
be there.

383
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:57,089
Open your hearts to each other, so that you
open your hearts to Me.

384
00:55:57,089 --> 00:56:02,439
Every cell must know another cell, otherwise
it won’t work out.

385
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:11,279
That is a great thing that has happened, when
you are on this Earth, when you are the ones

386
00:56:11,279 --> 00:56:14,719
who have to receive this great blessing.

387
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:21,219
So many saints did not receive it, so many
great people who came on this Earth, they

388
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:22,499
did not receive it.

389
00:56:22,499 --> 00:56:28,529
Even the incarnations who came on this Earth
could not do it what you are doing.

390
00:56:28,529 --> 00:56:37,209
So have that satisfaction and glory of your
own being and of your own standard, and of

391
00:56:37,209 --> 00:56:38,209
your own caliber.

392
00:56:38,209 --> 00:56:43,469
The others are not of your caliber, all right,
forget about it.

393
00:56:43,469 --> 00:56:49,789
That should not give you ego, but should give
you a personality that does not react.

394
00:56:49,789 --> 00:56:57,889
We have something of our own, we do not react
to things.

395
00:56:57,889 --> 00:57:00,909
We are not reactionaries.

396
00:57:00,909 --> 00:57:07,729
And things will disappear which are harmful.

397
00:57:07,729 --> 00:57:13,356
Everything will be perfectly all right, because
we are standing

398
00:57:13,385 --> 00:57:16,255
in our own perfection, in our own glory.

399
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:17,818
What do we need?

400
00:57:17,904 --> 00:57:20,982
Nothing, just enjoying ourselves.

401
00:57:24,202 --> 00:57:26,795
May God bless you all.
