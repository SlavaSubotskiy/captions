00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:50,761
Today we are celebrating the great event

2
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:56,087
of the resurrection of Christ.

3
00:00:58,462 --> 00:01:04,883
On the same pattern is your resurrection;

4
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:15,469
that you have risen to the new life of Divine love.

5
00:01:29,796 --> 00:01:42,524
You were all in the knowledge that
there’s something higher has to happen to you;

6
00:01:43,589 --> 00:01:53,891
that you are to be born again, but nobody knew how it works.

7
00:01:54,821 --> 00:02:04,950
The subtle side of your being was never told to you.

8
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:10,595
The saints only talked as to how you should behave.

9
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:21,106
They only said how you should try to keep a very pure life,

10
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:31,154
sincere life, but they didn't tell you how it will work out.

11
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:40,066
Of course people knew in India about it,

12
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:46,288
very few of them, very, very few of them,

13
00:02:47,128 --> 00:02:55,845
but now it's a worldwide knowledge through you people.

14
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:10,453
Now while your Kundalini rises,
She is your Mother, She is your individual Mother,

15
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:15,911
 and She gives you the second birth.

16
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:30,622
That's how you get connected to the Divine paradise.

17
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:37,753
All this, if it is told without realization has no meaning,

18
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:44,584
but people are given great ideas about it

19
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:57,156
and also were promised that one day your resurrection will come.

20
00:03:58,024 --> 00:04:01,614
It is the greatest happening for you,

21
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:07,773
 is the greatest event of your life,

22
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:16,937
and one must consider it’s very fortunate
that you have been able to achieve it.

23
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:25,278
All this because also because you desired for it.

24
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:40,357
In many of your lives
you have been desiring for the heavenly paradise.

25
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:52,338
People have been going round in the
hills and dales seeking; doing all kinds of things.

26
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:56,966
That's already done by you.

27
00:04:57,156 --> 00:05:04,058
You don't have to give up anything, no need to give up anything.

28
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:10,236
This wrong idea; I should say an untimely idea.

29
00:05:11,763 --> 00:05:20,707
This is the time when you have to get your
Sahaja resurrection, spontaneous resurrection.

30
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:28,740
You don't have to do anything about it,

31
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:35,496
 it's just so simple as that; has worked out so well.

32
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:44,965
I was really very much overjoyed to see that so many people,

33
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:50,573
specially Muslims, about whom I have been so much worried

34
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:54,189
 that how can you save these people?

35
00:05:54,705 --> 00:06:01,974
They are so much lost in the mess of wrong thinking.

36
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:13,623
One has to understand that this Koran was written

37
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:19,170
forty years after the death of Mohammed Sahib.

38
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:24,447
So maybe that there might be some words which are being,

39
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:36,519
 just being shifted maybe,
and the meaning might be little bit ambiguous.

40
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:48,544
Also there was another book called Sunna came out about the same time

41
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:56,290
 and was managed by a person who was not such a great

42
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:02,108
soul I should say, because he was not a realized soul.

43
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:10,635
I can't understand how can you religiously understand a poet same

44
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:17,823
and in the poetry whatever is written,
how can you interpret it correctly?

45
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:24,432
This is the reason why I, I am a poet also;

46
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:29,406
 I could have written a poetry about it but I said no.

47
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:37,616
Poetry can twist, can be twisted and also people can misuse it.

48
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:40,811
That’s the problem with the poetry is.

49
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:43,868
In India we had the same problem.

50
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:48,780
For example, Kabira wrote such beautiful poetry

51
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,637
 and the way they interpreted was so nonsensical

52
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:59,624
and so much different from the spirit of Kabira's songs.

53
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:05,571
About everything they can twist the words

54
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:14,594
 according to their own need,
I found out if I wrote poetry about Divinity.

55
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:19,559
This exactly what has happened.

56
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:27,385
In all the religions I’ve seen,
when it comes to poetry people can twist it.

57
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:41,653
Also, like in Bible, it was so much accepted

58
00:08:41,832 --> 00:08:52,563
that Paul is the one who is going to organize
the publication about Christ,

59
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:58,910
 and he didn't want to write also about resurrection;

60
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:03,485
he didn't want to write about the Immaculate Conception.

61
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:07,509
All these things were in his mind

62
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:14,120
and so Thomas had to run away to India
 and John refused to write anything.

63
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:18,869
Because all such people take charge.

64
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:20,974
They become in charge.

65
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:28,292
They think they are responsible for it,
while they are not at all capable.

66
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:32,207
They don't have the right to do it.

67
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:38,597
As a result of that, Christianity took a very

68
00:09:38,686 --> 00:09:44,716
 wrong attitude towards the inner growth of human being.

69
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:55,850
It’s, you see the result of that - today when you see what's happening

70
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:59,598
with the Catholic Church, you are amazed.

71
00:09:59,713 --> 00:10:05,254
How can such an organization be a religious organization,

72
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:09,777
where all kinds of nonsensical things are going on?

73
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:17,195
I was also born in a Christian family and
I was shocked the way they interpreted

74
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:23,051
Christ's life and the way talked about it with great authority.

75
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:26,049
Books and books were written.

76
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,859
They give big, big sermons.

77
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,872
I thought there's no truth in it what they are talking;

78
00:10:33,248 --> 00:10:35,938
even My father felt the same way.

79
00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:43,049
Because all these books came much after,

80
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:46,330
the authors of these books.

81
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:53,118
Secondly, those who tried to write it were not authorized to do that.

82
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,591
They were not spiritual people.

83
00:10:55,991 --> 00:11:02,696
They all wanted to have power; they wanted to have power in religion.

84
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:11,602
The power in religion is inside, and that should be awakened.

85
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:18,683
I must say thanks to the Sufis of this country and other countries

86
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:27,209
 that people still think that there is something
beyond all these words and talks and books.

87
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:37,470
This is something, such a blessing that we have
that in every country we had someone

88
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:41,303
who talked about reality, about the truth;

89
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:48,681
 though they were condemned, they were tortured,
and so many of them were killed.

90
00:11:49,769 --> 00:12:02,075
This is happening even today; I find that
people don't want to listen to reality, to the truth.

91
00:12:02,845 --> 00:12:06,273
But I was so happy yesterday, really overjoyed,

92
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:14,369
 to see that even the people who were Muslims, were Islamic,

93
00:12:14,512 --> 00:12:26,816
have now coming together, understanding that
 they have a higher life than these rituals of everyday.

94
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:36,269
All these ritualistic life that they have led,
the way they have worked so hard,

95
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:46,520
They these forty days starvation, going for Hajj -

96
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:52,380
doing all kinds of things - but there was no unity among themselves.

97
00:12:52,514 --> 00:12:55,996
Even among themselves there was no unity,

98
00:12:56,057 --> 00:13:03,750
 and some places I was surprised that they were killing each other.

99
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,802
How can that be?

100
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:14,806
Because these so called practices did not make them collective.

101
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:17,239
They were not collective.

102
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:22,145
They were all separate identities, separate sects,

103
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:29,656
guided by absolutely ignorant people.

104
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:38,504
So we have to really celebrate the unity of these people,

105
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,178
 the collective nature of these people, who were lost to the truth.

106
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:51,347
They had no idea as to what truth is,

107
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:59,680
but still a seeker can never find consolation

108
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:02,862
with whatever exists.

109
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:10,431
He’s seeking; he’s seeking and seeking till he finds the truth.

110
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:14,970
But also there are many seekers who lose their way.

111
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:18,603
In seeking they get lost.

112
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:25,293
It's very difficult to convince them that you have lost your way.

113
00:14:25,555 --> 00:14:29,515
But they should see from their own lives.

114
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:36,772
They should see from their own attainment.

115
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:40,762
What have they achieved?

116
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:44,552
Have they got any experience?

117
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:54,766
To be convinced of what you have got, you must try to verify it.

118
00:14:55,657 --> 00:15:03,340
You can verify on people; you can verify on yourself.

119
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:11,459
Whatever you are, you know on your fingertips as they say.

120
00:15:11,932 --> 00:15:15,810
Now it’s said in the Koran,

121
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:19,781
that at the time of your Kiyama – means resurrection time –

122
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:24,332
 they’re two things Kiyamat and Kiyama – two things –

123
00:15:24,586 --> 00:15:27,290
also many people don’t understand the difference.

124
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,690
One is when the resurrection time comes,

125
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:36,912
 and the another is when your destruction comes in.

126
00:15:37,355 --> 00:15:43,312
For the resurrection of human being is the Kiyama,

127
00:15:43,463 --> 00:15:48,663
 in which it’s said that your hands will speak;

128
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:55,475
that you should feel the vibrations on your fingertips.

129
00:15:55,621 --> 00:16:08,281
I would say those who are really Muslims,
who are surrendered, and those who have been

130
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:22,996
selected to be higher people belonging to
the God's realm must have hands that can speak;

131
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:26,046
otherwise they are not Muslims.

132
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,459
I would not call them Muslims.

133
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:33,121
They may be human beings, but not Muslims.

134
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:38,567
So it's compulsory that for every Muslim,

135
00:16:38,671 --> 00:16:44,716
he thinks he’s a Muslim, he should have vibrations in his hands.

136
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,455
He should feel the vibration.

137
00:16:47,560 --> 00:17:02,142
His hands must speak at the time of resurrection,
 which is the Kiyama, Kiyama - not Kiyamat.

138
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:07,491
These two words are confused in the minds of the people.

139
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:17,194
So those people who can verify about
their achievements themselves

140
00:17:17,315 --> 00:17:20,992
through their vibrations on their hands,

141
00:17:21,112 --> 00:17:27,436
and also about others through their fingertips are the Muslims;

142
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:33,888
 according to Koran, but nobody has told them this.

143
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,769
They don't know.

144
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:39,199
To them it’s all right if you go to Mecca

145
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:43,250
and come back from there; you become a Hajji, finished.

146
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:48,334
There’s another question one should ask which is very important -

147
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:55,668
that why Mohammed Sahib was so much against stone worshipping,

148
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,571
 clearly, why did He ask people to go round

149
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,719
that black square stone?

150
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:08,154
What was the purpose of that?

151
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:14,188
Why was that stone so important?

152
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:22,745
If you ask this question to any so called Muslim
he’ll say that was the order,

153
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:27,616
 but you can ask the question after all why?

154
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:29,853
That's also just a stone.

155
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:39,460
So why did, why did Mohammed Sahib ask
that you should go round that stone?

156
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:46,565
So many statues were there made of stone

157
00:18:46,931 --> 00:18:53,772
 and people started worshipping all kinds of statues
as they do in India also.

158
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:58,056
But this stone was a Swayambhu,

159
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:04,344
and is mentioned in the Indian scriptures
that there is Meccashwar Shiva.

160
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:11,500
We have Shivas everywhere in India; there are twelve Jyotirlingas.

161
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:17,417
Now if I tell you, you need not believe Me,
but you can go and verify on your vibrations

162
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:22,482
if it is a Shiva or not; same with this black stone.

163
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:28,068
So Mohammed Sahib found out that this is a Meccashwar Shiva

164
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:39,633
and so the people have to go round to achieve Shiva's blessings,
but it became a ritual.

165
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:48,340
The whole thing became like a ritual
and nobody could go further from that ritual.

166
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:51,417
Same thing with the Christianity.

167
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:58,593
Why today is a day they are talking so big
 about repentance

168
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:06,505
 and about feeling guilty about what
they have done, but why did they do it?

169
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:17,557
They are supposed to be in charge of goodness,
 of virtues - so why did they do it?

170
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:24,474
Why did they do wrong things and now asking forgiveness from God?

171
00:20:24,627 --> 00:20:29,203
Because they were not realized souls.

172
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:32,245
They’re not Sahaja Yogis.

173
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:37,434
If the Sahaja Yogis try to do something wrong

174
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,526
then they know that they are doing wrong on their fingertips,

175
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:45,911
 or we can ask them to get out of Sahaja Yoga,

176
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:50,217
but that seems to be the worst punishment for Sahaja Yogis.

177
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:54,921
If I tell them to get out of Sahaja Yoga, they don't like it.

178
00:20:55,591 --> 00:20:57,089
Why?

179
00:20:57,114 --> 00:21:05,527
Because they feel we are separated from reality.

180
00:21:05,837 --> 00:21:13,068
All the blessings of the reality are lost to them;
they think that way.

181
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:24,612
The punishment is nothing,
because we just ask you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

182
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:30,998
To look at it’s nothing, but Sahaja Yoga is complete freedom.

183
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:35,368
Sahaja Yoga is complete blessing.

184
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:40,341
Sahaja Yoga is complete peace and joy.

185
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:47,533
Surprisingly, if you read Koran you’ll be amazed that Mohammed Sahib

186
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:54,119
 wanted to bring peace, but it's not so.

187
00:21:56,088 --> 00:21:59,794
I met one man from Kashmir.

188
00:21:59,941 --> 00:22:03,479
He said that, “Where is the peace?

189
00:22:04,566 --> 00:22:07,935
They are all fighting, fighting; we want peace.”

190
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,265
But surprisingly, he said, “In India we find there’s peace.

191
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:18,693
But this Kashmir is a mad place
where everybody is all the time challenged

192
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:23,632
and everything attacked - under the name of Islam itself.”

193
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:27,917
So I said, it's not Islam.

194
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,942
Islam means surrender.

195
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:34,580
And he said, “If you surrender they‘ll kill you.

196
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:38,665
We have no protection.”

197
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:43,123
It's very surprising, very, very surprising,

198
00:22:43,378 --> 00:22:47,306
 how now the Muslims themselves are realizing

199
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:53,150
that this cannot be Divine life.
This cannot be Divine life,

200
00:22:53,539 --> 00:23:01,150
because in Divine life people are just the same with each other.

201
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:04,807
You see we had Sufis all over the world.

202
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,916
I have read them.

203
00:23:06,941 --> 00:23:16,968
I have read the Sufis of Turkey and also other places.

204
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:22,861
Even in India we had Sufis, though
they don't call themselves Sufis so much.

205
00:23:23,464 --> 00:23:31,372
Sufi means, I don't know what ever you may think it,
but according to Indian understanding

206
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,647
Sufi means 'saaf' and 'saaf' means clean, means pure.

207
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:40,027
Those who are pure people are Sufis.

208
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:50,676
In the purity they see nothing
but Divine grace, Divine love, Divine peace.

209
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:55,601
They talked of peace only; they could not talk of war.

210
00:23:55,849 --> 00:24:05,649
Anybody who talks of war cannot be a person who
has got any right to do that.

211
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:13,052
War is absolutely like madness.

212
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:16,174
Even animals won't fight like that.

213
00:24:16,301 --> 00:24:22,530
We are even worse than animals when
we think of war and killing each other.

214
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:29,798
This should not be done and it has to be stopped completely.

215
00:24:29,994 --> 00:24:40,189
Nobody has right to kill anybody unless and until he is attacked.

216
00:24:41,684 --> 00:24:50,939
So what we hear about our resurrection
is this - that we are above so many things.

217
00:24:51,245 --> 00:24:57,096
We have lost all those destructive qualities.

218
00:24:57,237 --> 00:25:06,812
As in Sanskrit they call it we have six enemies –
 kama, kroda, mada, mathsarya, loba moha.

219
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:10,632
Kama means sexual perversion.

220
00:25:10,835 --> 00:25:13,208
Kroda means anger.

221
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:16,730
Moha means attraction.

222
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:19,590
Mada means the pride.

223
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:24,571
Mathsarya means jealously.

224
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:36,264
All these six things, sixth one is the greed,

225
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:45,740
all these six things that we had in our mind - out of
our ignorance, out of our upbringing,

226
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:50,176
out of our reading, whatever it is,

227
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:56,120
whatever we had developed, we were having - just drops out.

228
00:25:57,242 --> 00:26:03,741
When the Kundalini rises and you become one with the Divine,

229
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:07,781
then you are on sound grounds.

230
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,096
You realize that you have found the truth

231
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:18,003
and you no more can enjoy all these destructive habits.

232
00:26:18,265 --> 00:26:20,569
They just drop out.

233
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:29,877
So you go into a new realm of Divine construction within you.

234
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,569
This is the real resurrection of human beings.

235
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:43,627
Now, you know that certain subtle things
still remain despite the fact

236
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:50,603
that people try to destroy the books, to spoil the meaning of things.

237
00:26:50,754 --> 00:26:55,394
Despite that, subtle things remain there.

238
00:26:55,951 --> 00:27:04,486
For example we offer eggs during Easter.

239
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,372
What's the meaning of offering eggs?

240
00:27:09,613 --> 00:27:12,174
Why should we offer an egg?

241
00:27:12,502 --> 00:27:21,047
First of all we offer egg because
the egg can go into a transformation.

242
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:25,372
It can become a small chick;

243
00:27:25,606 --> 00:27:31,448
it can be born again.
It’s the egg has the capacity to be born again.

244
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:41,462
So when you get this egg as a symbol of Easter it means -

245
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:48,977
you can become a different person, a reformed person

246
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:54,759
and a great spiritual person.
You can become; it means that.

247
00:27:54,814 --> 00:27:57,079
Why do we give eggs?

248
00:27:57,132 --> 00:27:59,142
People don't know.

249
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:01,313
I asked so many people.

250
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,287
I asked even some priests who think
they are great authorities of Christianity.

251
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:10,619
They didn't know why they give eggs.

252
00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:22,844
Secondly, if you read the story about
the birth of Shri Ganesh

253
00:28:23,008 --> 00:28:30,775
and then you proceed on, you’ll be surprised is written down
that it was called as Brahmand -

254
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:39,100
means the egg of the Brahma that came into existence,

255
00:28:39,466 --> 00:28:47,381
and half of it became the Mahavishnu means the Christ,

256
00:28:47,484 --> 00:28:53,904
 and half of it remained as Shri Ganesh.

257
00:28:54,245 --> 00:29:04,064
And then it is said that then when Mahavishnu
came out, He started crying for His Father.

258
00:29:04,486 --> 00:29:09,597
Just think of it, He was asking for His Father.

259
00:29:09,803 --> 00:29:16,546
Now if you see Christ, He always uses these two fingers.

260
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,777
No other Incarnation has used these two fingers.

261
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:29,160
This means you know this is the Vishuddhi and this is the Nabhi.

262
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:40,194
That means He’s talking of His Father who was Nabhi King.

263
00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:43,707
Who's that? You know that very well is the Vishnu,

264
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:49,685
 and His incarnation as Shri Krishna.

265
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:55,852
So what He’s indicating is this, that - they are My Father.

266
00:29:56,043 --> 00:29:58,262
How clearly He does that.

267
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:04,700
Why not have some other mudras,
other style of holding the fingers?

268
00:30:04,818 --> 00:30:09,491
But He hold always these two fingers, meaning -

269
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:15,537
My Father the one who was Vishnu and who was Shri Krishna.

270
00:30:17,156 --> 00:30:29,519
And then in the lives of Shri Krishna
they say, “Mahavishnu will be Your Son.”

271
00:30:29,723 --> 00:30:35,690
All these things are not put together as
 I am telling you; separately,

272
00:30:35,772 --> 00:30:44,164
but if you have proper understanding
you can understand the connection between the two -

273
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:55,476
 that Christ was the son of Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna

274
00:30:55,936 --> 00:31:05,046
 and that was blessed that
 “You will be the support of the whole universe.”

275
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:09,050
The support, the adhar of the whole universe, He said it clearly.

276
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:19,301
It is said so that “You will be supporting the whole universe.”

277
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:26,687
Now the one half is Shri Ganesh who, is the support in a way;

278
00:31:26,782 --> 00:31:31,952
it supports the Kundalini, it looks after the Kundalini,

279
00:31:32,071 --> 00:31:39,641
 it looks after the chastity of the Mother -

280
00:31:39,872 --> 00:31:48,805
and the another one which is expressed is Jesus Christ,

281
00:31:49,281 --> 00:31:54,789
who is the support of the whole universe.

282
00:31:55,343 --> 00:32:02,324
So naturally it has to be the moral basis

283
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:09,295
as He is a part and parcel of Shri Ganesha,

284
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:12,991
it's the moral basis of human beings.

285
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:19,051
On the moral basis only you will be supported;

286
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,413
not all other nonsense that they have,

287
00:32:22,588 --> 00:32:31,270
but a moral basis, and which is missing
in the lives of Christianity.

288
00:32:31,494 --> 00:32:37,222
Everything is allowed, very surprising.

289
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:45,970
You can do whatever you like as long as
you don't take a divorce in the Catholic Church.

290
00:32:46,446 --> 00:32:55,954
And also in the other Church which you can call
non-Catholic Churches, there are many,

291
00:32:56,275 --> 00:33:07,156
even if you are married, you can do whatever you like.

292
00:33:07,514 --> 00:33:13,229
Even the Vatican I was told has all these problems.

293
00:33:13,976 --> 00:33:20,866
How can that be if you are the people who think you are baptized?

294
00:33:21,341 --> 00:33:26,251
I mean there's a big celebration of baptism by these priests.

295
00:33:26,557 --> 00:33:31,314
Then where is the Sahasrara and where is the Kundalini

296
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,435
and how do you have your second birth?

297
00:33:34,903 --> 00:33:39,788
There's no second birth, just some priest puts his hand on your head.

298
00:33:39,973 --> 00:33:44,765
Actually it makes a problem for realized souls,

299
00:33:44,948 --> 00:33:49,578
 to put hand of the priest who are not realized souls,

300
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:53,285
and that creates a problem for children.

301
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:57,236
I have seen many children they start crying loudly

302
00:33:57,348 --> 00:34:01,446
when they are being blessed by these priests,

303
00:34:02,255 --> 00:34:06,213
because they are realized souls and the priests are not.

304
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,740
It's very interesting.

305
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:13,094
But they say, “After all you see it's the priests that are bad,

306
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:17,855
but not Christ.” But how are they related to each other?

307
00:34:18,092 --> 00:34:22,567
Christ stood for morality.

308
00:34:24,336 --> 00:34:32,287
And about Him also in these modern times
they are saying all kinds of filthy things.

309
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:42,172
They cannot understand a character
which is moral; to this extent we have gone.

310
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:47,861
Morality is out of question.

311
00:34:48,473 --> 00:34:55,097
You do whatever you like; as long as
you go to church and confess, you’re all right.

312
00:34:55,859 --> 00:35:01,598
These are the absurdities of modern religions.

313
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:10,076
Every religion has problems and the worst  I feel,
when you have

314
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,283
the support of the world as your leader -

315
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:22,029
how can you allow people to have such a immoral life?

316
00:35:24,527 --> 00:35:33,996
Immorality how can you tolerate when you follow the example of Christ?

317
00:35:34,455 --> 00:35:38,002
Out of question!

318
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:43,234
He is the embodiment of morality.

319
00:35:43,378 --> 00:35:51,423
He is Shri Ganesh and how can you allow people

320
00:35:51,892 --> 00:35:56,400
 to come to churches, to the temples,

321
00:35:56,824 --> 00:36:02,324
and allow them to have immoral life?

322
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:07,414
What is the atonement for such people?

323
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:19,569
The basis of Christ's life, the whole being
of Christ is morality; to establish purity.

324
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:28,918
Now, it was Shri Ganesha who was created first

325
00:36:29,108 --> 00:36:37,207
by the Adishakti, because She wanted purity around.

326
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,609
She wanted human beings to enjoy their purity

327
00:36:45,688 --> 00:36:55,269
and their personality which was emitting light to others.

328
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:02,140
If there is impurity say for example on a glass

329
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:09,447
and if you use that glass on top of the light,
how can the light pass out?

330
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:18,070
The impure life cannot, cannot give light to others,

331
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:22,025
 and cannot show your inner light also.

332
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:30,405
Both things are absolutely true about impurities.

333
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:35,256
But people say that we have to accept

334
00:37:35,368 --> 00:37:40,399
because if you have to have more people for your religion

335
00:37:40,473 --> 00:37:46,875
you should accept many things, and one of them is impurity.

336
00:37:49,473 --> 00:37:51,811
And just think of it.

337
00:37:51,942 --> 00:37:56,709
Now at the Agnya where Christ resides,

338
00:37:56,979 --> 00:38:02,820
if your eyes are impure, full of lust and greed,

339
00:38:03,591 --> 00:38:11,682
then you are against Christ; you are an antichrist.

340
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:20,699
If your eyes are clean and pure,

341
00:38:21,023 --> 00:38:30,325
 then only you can enjoy love of God, otherwise you cannot.

342
00:38:31,368 --> 00:38:38,790
And also the love of another Sahaja Yogi or Yogini you can only enjoy

343
00:38:38,873 --> 00:38:43,666
 in completeness if your eyes are clean.

344
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:46,169
Just imagine.

345
00:38:46,779 --> 00:38:56,470
But if you have roving eyes and all sorts of things, I don't know

346
00:38:56,828 --> 00:39:01,457
 how can you call yourself Christians? You cannot.

347
00:39:02,412 --> 00:39:06,693
Whatever certificate you may carry, but you are not,

348
00:39:06,862 --> 00:39:14,231
 because those who are following Christ
have to have absolutely a moral life.

349
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:22,761
That's a compulsion of the inner being on you -

350
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:28,798
that you enjoy your morality

351
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:36,540
 and you enjoy above all your clean eyes.

352
00:39:37,883 --> 00:39:48,516
This is what I have come to know about the Western life
 that the eyes are not clean.

353
00:39:48,651 --> 00:39:53,555
They’ll go to the church and their eyes will be moving here and there.

354
00:39:53,707 --> 00:39:55,977
How can that be?

355
00:39:56,009 --> 00:39:58,418
How can you do that?

356
00:39:58,443 --> 00:40:05,424
If you think Christ is the one who was resurrected
and you are to be resurrected,

357
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:11,808
first of all see that you have pure love in your eyes.

358
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:20,252
Now pure love is not relative, cannot be contaminated,

359
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:25,791
 cannot have lust and greed in them.

360
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:32,967
These two things have to drop out from your mind completely.

361
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:43,023
These are the days of people having greed, lots of greed they have.

362
00:40:45,498 --> 00:40:49,201
I just don't know what sort of things they have because

363
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:53,547
 I haven't studied so much the immorality of human being.

364
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:58,955
Whatever I see are beautiful people like you.

365
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:07,115
But when I try to understand the so-called Western culture

366
00:41:07,274 --> 00:41:12,874
I am surprised that even if they want to make a life for someone -

367
00:41:13,136 --> 00:41:18,525
 like “The Life of Shakespeare” I saw,
who was according to Me

368
00:41:18,724 --> 00:41:26,890
was Avadhoota; means a person who has gone beyond all human

369
00:41:27,181 --> 00:41:35,148
destructive habits, Avadhoot is a very high quality yogi -

370
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:41,893
and they show him as a stupid man running after a woman.

371
00:41:42,235 --> 00:41:54,055
They cannot conceive of human beings
who could be morally perfect, who will have moral sense.

372
00:41:54,126 --> 00:42:02,794
They cannot conceive, because those
who do this kind of thing are not realized soul.

373
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:05,384
They are not Sahaja Yogis.

374
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:11,184
So the conception about morality doesn't come into their head.

375
00:42:11,343 --> 00:42:14,361
They think as we are like that, the others are.

376
00:42:14,414 --> 00:42:19,045
Actually mostly they do it to justify themselves.

377
00:42:19,212 --> 00:42:30,732
So ugly and so horrifying is the depiction
of the character of such great people

378
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:39,590
who talk such great things, shows that human beings
are really degraded in their value system.

379
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:47,711
They cannot conceive of somebody who is an ideal personality.

380
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:56,650
They think by saying so they are talking of something beyond reality.

381
00:42:56,705 --> 00:42:59,670
They don't know reality.

382
00:43:01,177 --> 00:43:05,098
Yesterday’s Sufi thing, I was very impressed

383
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:08,442
when they said about the four stages that you have.

384
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:14,309
And out of that the Haakikat - means the reality,

385
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:19,166
you have to get into the reality.

386
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:22,219
Reality is what?

387
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:25,712
It’s not a perception.

388
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:31,441
It's not seeing something, but it’s being something.

389
00:43:33,982 --> 00:43:41,033
If you start seeing, you might see something
white, red, yellow but you are not that.

390
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:50,290
When you are, you are the reality,
then you emit reality,

391
00:43:50,607 --> 00:43:56,475
you see reality, you enjoy reality, you live in reality.

392
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:01,761
This is real life and you don't indulge into

393
00:44:01,825 --> 00:44:09,106
something which is unreal, imaginary or below dignity.

394
00:44:09,131 --> 00:44:10,677
No you don't do it.

395
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:15,885
You are the reality, is the Haakikat, as they say.

396
00:44:15,961 --> 00:44:22,418
You are the reality and you are emitting reality

397
00:44:22,474 --> 00:44:29,884
 in your behavior, in your talks, in your lives, in everything.

398
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:42,153
All this brings forth the greatest force of spirituality.

399
00:44:45,032 --> 00:44:53,457
Whatever is falsehood, whatever is wrong, whatever is destructive,

400
00:44:53,989 --> 00:45:00,233
 will run away from a man who stands in reality; is automatic.

401
00:45:02,551 --> 00:45:07,452
It is absolutely part and parcel

402
00:45:07,658 --> 00:45:12,964
of the same personality who is supposed to be a realized soul.

403
00:45:13,509 --> 00:45:19,128
So the resurrection has taken place no doubt - all right.

404
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:21,951
Your hands are speaking - all right.

405
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:33,855
I don't want to give you any command or
any kind of a fixed road that you have to follow.

406
00:45:34,176 --> 00:45:38,426
Now you are free, because you have the light.

407
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:41,511
When you have the light why should I tell you which way to go?

408
00:45:41,536 --> 00:45:50,526
You know yourself that you have the light,
so you follow yourself in a way

409
00:45:50,621 --> 00:45:55,974
 that is an enlightened path, with your own light.

410
00:45:56,101 --> 00:46:00,131
Don’t somebody has to tell you
hat don't do this, don't do, nothing of the kind.

411
00:46:00,314 --> 00:46:05,580
You want just do it, if something wrong
 you will not do; if you are doing it

412
00:46:05,614 --> 00:46:11,649
then know that you have to still rise above all this thing.

413
00:46:12,252 --> 00:46:18,243
You are the Nabhis that are described in the Koran.

414
00:46:18,483 --> 00:46:23,814
You are the ones who are going to resurrect the whole world.

415
00:46:23,973 --> 00:46:31,306
You are the ones who are going to help the downtrodden people

416
00:46:31,442 --> 00:46:36,952
into the filth of immorality. Your life should show.

417
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:46,163
Look at these few of these people who were Sufis,

418
00:46:46,354 --> 00:46:53,582
who were very clean people, how have they been able to channelize

419
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:57,140
 the other people into a better life?

420
00:46:57,935 --> 00:47:00,350
That is what you are.

421
00:47:00,513 --> 00:47:06,008
You have to channelize their lives; that's your job.

422
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:13,890
Don't think about what is happening,
how the people are stupid, immoral, forget it.

423
00:47:14,145 --> 00:47:16,955
What you have to know what you are.

424
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:24,564
You have to be aware of yourself
and of your responsibility as being the purest of pure.

425
00:47:24,939 --> 00:47:29,590
As my name is indicates, you are My children,

426
00:47:29,689 --> 00:47:35,506
and that indicates the children of Nirmal, means purity.

427
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:41,501
Purity is the basis of your existence.

428
00:47:42,357 --> 00:47:48,490
You should try to see where, what you were, in which part.

429
00:47:48,762 --> 00:47:54,391
There’s no mistake in appreciating the art,

430
00:47:54,550 --> 00:48:00,970
appreciating all that is beautiful, appreciating all

431
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:06,177
that is created out of beautiful minds,

432
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,078
but there should be no lust and greed in that appreciation.

433
00:48:11,373 --> 00:48:16,888
Pure appreciation, purity is the message,

434
00:48:16,942 --> 00:48:22,470
and once you have the purity within yourself you will love yourself.

435
00:48:22,745 --> 00:48:26,094
As I love you, you will love you also.

436
00:48:26,142 --> 00:48:32,996
And then you will understand this word love
which comes out of the purity.

437
00:48:33,283 --> 00:48:42,431
The blossoming of your purity,
the fragrance of your purity, you enjoy all the time

438
00:48:42,572 --> 00:48:48,574
and the love that you have flows,

439
00:48:48,685 --> 00:48:55,335
 flows towards all those who are to be loved,
who have to be looked after.

440
00:48:55,652 --> 00:49:01,941
Don’t worry about the people who are destructive.

441
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:07,136
That's the only word I can use,
because there are so many things one can say about.

442
00:49:07,335 --> 00:49:12,525
Let them be destructive because they are destroying themselves.

443
00:49:12,626 --> 00:49:15,207
Why should we worry about them?

444
00:49:15,278 --> 00:49:17,720
They think they are destroying others but they are not,

445
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:22,535
they are destroying themselves.
So forget about it, just forget.

446
00:49:22,688 --> 00:49:32,390
You think yourself to be responsible for the construction
of the whole world,

447
00:49:32,457 --> 00:49:35,177
 it's not only a few people.

448
00:49:35,495 --> 00:49:40,218
You are very intelligent, knowledgeable and understanding.

449
00:49:40,313 --> 00:49:44,929
You are not like the Disciples of Christ who were not educated,

450
00:49:44,956 --> 00:49:52,851
who didn't understand so much and
who did get realization but were not of your level.

451
00:49:53,505 --> 00:50:01,676
Whatever they could do reached to a point
where this kind of a mess of a Christianity has come,

452
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,012
but you can't create that kind.

453
00:50:05,096 --> 00:50:15,119
You will create a new vibrant religion which is global.

454
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:21,632
I was very happy to see that now
we have people from all over the world.

455
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:24,504
It’s a global movement all over.

456
00:50:25,044 --> 00:50:32,083
It has nothing to do with the limited ideas of so called religions.

457
00:50:32,369 --> 00:50:35,480
They have ruined every religion.

458
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:43,744
Islam is ruined, Christianity ruined,
and Hinduism ruined, and Buddhism the worst.

459
00:50:44,257 --> 00:50:47,287
In Buddhism you give up everything -

460
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:54,740
all your belongings, all your property, give to the guru, imagine!

461
00:50:55,169 --> 00:51:02,657
And the guru is so greedy horrible fellow.

462
00:51:03,496 --> 00:51:10,052
How can he give resurrection?
Himself is a greedy fellow,

463
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:16,130
misleading others just taking away everything.

464
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,718
Then same thing about Christianity

465
00:51:20,821 --> 00:51:23,824
that you all become Nuns,
 you become Fathers, you become

466
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:27,602
Brothers and I don’t know, all nonsense.

467
00:51:27,859 --> 00:51:31,379
But there's no change within.

468
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:38,789
Somebody came to Me and I said, “Why did you become a priest?”

469
00:51:38,878 --> 00:51:41,588
He said, “Because I was jobless.

470
00:51:42,945 --> 00:51:44,690
I had no job.”

471
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:45,690
Baba?

472
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:48,132
“So I took up the job of a priest.”

473
00:51:48,211 --> 00:51:49,671
Can you imagine?

474
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:57,236
He could not fit into any job, so the minimum of minimum
he took is this job.

475
00:51:57,563 --> 00:51:59,793
Then what did you do?

476
00:51:59,967 --> 00:52:06,437
“They told me what I have to preach and first I had to practice

477
00:52:06,855 --> 00:52:11,347
and remember it by heart, and then I don't know,

478
00:52:11,471 --> 00:52:18,383
I started talking this, talking that.”
I said he must be a big possessed man.

479
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:24,019
He had no mind of his own; he didn't know what he was talking.

480
00:52:24,154 --> 00:52:30,820
He would take out one sentence from Bible
and go on talking, boring everybody.

481
00:52:31,001 --> 00:52:38,232
And I was surprised that within fifteen minutes
people wanted to get out of the church.

482
00:52:38,598 --> 00:52:46,105
As soon as the sermon was over they would run out
and breathe, “Thank God.”

483
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:50,842
Is that what religion gives you?

484
00:52:51,057 --> 00:52:53,710
Is that what should happen to you?

485
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:56,713
No, it's not that.

486
00:52:56,857 --> 00:53:03,020
What happens to you that
you enjoy yourself, you enjoy the collectivity,

487
00:53:03,045 --> 00:53:05,319
you enjoy the goodness, the morality.

488
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:11,402
The whole thing is like the nectar of life.

489
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:17,140
So that changes the whole picture.

490
00:53:17,687 --> 00:53:24,440
The ritualism is so much; in the Hindu religion
there is too much of ritualism.

491
00:53:24,697 --> 00:53:32,194
You sit on the right or you sit on the left;
you do this at this time I mean, lots of it.

492
00:53:32,358 --> 00:53:37,192
That when your sister dies how many days you should starve yourself;

493
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:40,609
if your husband dies then how many days?

494
00:53:41,543 --> 00:53:46,931
Dies is died, finished; the body’s finished now.

495
00:53:47,302 --> 00:53:51,653
So you fast for so many days - is very wrong,

496
00:53:51,678 --> 00:53:55,364
because you’re fasting the bhoot might come in to you.

497
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:04,113
But still, what I would say all these ritualisms and all that,

498
00:54:04,253 --> 00:54:12,705
are created by human beings
who were claiming to be something great.

499
00:54:12,893 --> 00:54:20,017
They are not; by no means they are the people in charge of morality,

500
00:54:20,064 --> 00:54:25,007
 in charge of higher life.

501
00:54:25,578 --> 00:54:31,121
They lead such a mundane useless life.

502
00:54:33,206 --> 00:54:36,400
I went to a temple of Shri Ganesha,

503
00:54:36,484 --> 00:54:42,524
which is supposed to be Swayambhu,
one of the eight temples; it is one of them.

504
00:54:45,794 --> 00:54:47,501
And I was surprised.

505
00:54:47,526 --> 00:54:56,749
The man who was worshipping was supposed to be the priest,
he was suffering from paralysis,

506
00:54:57,323 --> 00:55:04,843
and his brother died of paralysis, now his son was also paralyzed.

507
00:55:05,129 --> 00:55:08,257
He said, “What is this Ganesha doing to us Mother?”

508
00:55:08,282 --> 00:55:11,792
I said, “What are you doing to Ganesha?

509
00:55:12,054 --> 00:55:16,064
How much money you earn out of it?”

510
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:18,776
He said, “Quite a lot.”

511
00:55:19,038 --> 00:55:21,293
“And then what do you do with this money?

512
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,162
Do you do anything for the society?

513
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,712
Do you try to improve their lives?

514
00:55:26,737 --> 00:55:33,274
Have you any attention on the society
or you are just ooking after yourself?”

515
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:39,901
As a result, he’s got paralysis,
 his brother got paralysis, son got paralysis.

516
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,946
And he was blaming Ganesha for that.

517
00:55:44,446 --> 00:55:49,188
He said, “Is it a real Ganesha?”
“Yes it is, but you are not.

518
00:55:49,498 --> 00:55:52,574
You don't deserve.”
I told him off on his face.

519
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:56,148
He said, “All right you may say whatever you like but You cure me.”

520
00:55:56,267 --> 00:56:01,535
I said, “First promise that whatever money you get out of this temple

521
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:06,379
you will spend it for the betterment of people.”

522
00:56:07,338 --> 00:56:10,369
But how can they?

523
00:56:11,813 --> 00:56:14,193
They are not realized souls.

524
00:56:14,296 --> 00:56:19,566
Such a lot of priests I see walking about with all this funny dresses.

525
00:56:19,606 --> 00:56:20,606
What?

526
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:27,926
These are like dead bodies,
walking around with all kinds bad vibrations.

527
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,947
I can't understand.

528
00:56:31,215 --> 00:56:37,175
And the other people are very simple,
they say, "Oh my goodness, see now he’s a priest."

529
00:56:37,374 --> 00:56:39,247
So they must respect.

530
00:56:39,272 --> 00:56:42,984
But, they don't see it; they do not ascertain

531
00:56:43,009 --> 00:56:50,609
what is the spiritual value of that person
who calls himself as the priest.

532
00:56:52,023 --> 00:56:54,153
That is your job.

533
00:56:54,256 --> 00:56:55,875
You don't have to fight with them.

534
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,749
You don't have to denounce them.

535
00:56:57,749 --> 00:57:00,870
You don't have to describe them.

536
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:04,710
No need, but understand that you are different.

537
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:08,585
You have the right. You are the authority

538
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,954
 and so with that authority and confidence

539
00:57:11,979 --> 00:57:15,049
 you have to go about and save people.

540
00:57:15,049 --> 00:57:18,498
You are realized souls.

541
00:57:18,651 --> 00:57:21,352
You got your resurrection.

542
00:57:21,384 --> 00:57:27,414
You are yogis; I agree, but what is your job?

543
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,091
Why, why this has happened?

544
00:57:30,178 --> 00:57:36,971
Why this light has come in to you is to take the blind

545
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:42,911
in your hands and take them towards the light.

546
00:57:43,149 --> 00:57:47,026
This is what is your resurrection for.

547
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:56,536
It's not only for your seeking but also is the grace of the Divine,

548
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:01,718
for you to make the whole world Divine, as far as possible.

549
00:58:01,803 --> 00:58:04,742
How many people have you given realization?

550
00:58:04,822 --> 00:58:06,856
How many people you have talked to them?

551
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:10,283
I tell you I was surprised; once I was traveling by plane

552
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:13,927
 and there was some lady traveling with Me

553
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:18,875
and she started talking to Me about her cult, about her nonsense.

554
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:22,532
So look at it, shamelessly she was talking.

555
00:58:22,809 --> 00:58:28,357
Listening to her I said, Sahaja Yogis won't,
 they won't talk about Sahaja Yoga.

556
00:58:28,584 --> 00:58:34,348
Every person who is a Sahaja Yogi has to talk about Sahaja Yoga,

557
00:58:34,538 --> 00:58:38,866
may not be with the wrong type but with the right type of people.

558
00:58:39,378 --> 00:58:43,760
That's a thing you have to do. That's why you are enlightened.

559
00:58:44,127 --> 00:58:48,913
You are not enlightened to be put somewhere in the forest

560
00:58:49,421 --> 00:58:52,356
or to be lost to the whole world.

561
00:58:52,381 --> 00:58:58,230
You are enlightened; you are resurrected to enlighten other people.

562
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:01,669
That's what you are there for

563
00:59:02,233 --> 00:59:04,823
and you can do it. Many have done it.

564
00:59:04,864 --> 00:59:07,185
So many of you have done it,

565
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:13,834
and I would say that all of you, whether
 you are a man or a woman, you have to do it.

566
00:59:15,517 --> 00:59:25,980
And that's the request of your Mother - t
hat make use of your realization.

567
00:59:26,618 --> 00:59:33,083
And the attention should be only on realization.

568
00:59:33,468 --> 00:59:38,621
How many people you are going to give realization to?

569
00:59:38,858 --> 00:59:42,745
How many people you are going to save?

570
00:59:43,626 --> 00:59:46,690
Is a very simple job for you.

571
00:59:46,747 --> 00:59:48,728
You have to just raise the Kundalini.

572
00:59:48,826 --> 00:59:49,876
You can.

573
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:54,535
You should see how just with your hand
you can raise the Kundalini of others

574
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,240
 and give them their resurrection.

575
00:59:57,642 --> 00:59:59,888
You don't have to do anything.

576
00:59:59,913 --> 01:00:03,157
The life is not that difficult for you.

577
01:00:03,196 --> 01:00:07,355
Your job is the easiest thing; it’s just to raise your hand.

578
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,831
In hand, in your hand you have the power,

579
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:18,709
 just to raise your hand and give them realization,
instead of feeling diffident.

580
01:00:20,106 --> 01:00:24,624
That's why I would say you are all resurrected,

581
01:00:24,712 --> 01:00:27,565
you are all realized souls,

582
01:00:27,733 --> 01:00:31,335
and you have to create the Divine paradise on this earth.
