3
00:00:16,206 --> 00:00:23,927
It was such a surprise to see you all in that procession.

4
00:00:25,961 --> 00:00:28,551
Actually I was waiting and waiting, and I thought,

5
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:32,969
“Why these people are not coming to call Me for Puja?”

6
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:38,425
It was a beautiful surprise, it’s very joy giving.

7
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:08,295
The joy was dancing in your eyes.

8
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:12,277
I could see the lights in your eyes

9
00:01:14,212 --> 00:01:17,128
and this is the real Diwali.

10
00:01:17,248 --> 00:01:23,390
Diwali word comes from two words: ‘dipa’ and ‘awali’.

11
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:29,013
Dipa means, you know, lights, and awali means rows,

12
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:31,948
rows and rows of lights.

13
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:35,777
Seems it’s a very, very ancient idea

14
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:37,640
and all over in the world, you see,

15
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,461
whenever they have to celebrate something

16
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:48,164
then they put lights. And lights because light gives joy,

17
00:01:48,284 --> 00:01:50,380
gives happiness.

18
00:01:52,443 --> 00:01:56,597
So to overcome the darkness of ignorance

19
00:01:57,771 --> 00:02:01,906
also we have to enlighten ourselves.

20
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:07,440
And that is why is important that everybody

21
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,838
should get Self-realization

22
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:13,730
to feel the light within themselves.

23
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:19,414
And you must have noticed that after realization

24
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:21,891
the eyes also sparkle.

25
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,991
There’s light in the eyes of every Sahaja yogi.

26
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:36,083
Today is the day when we worship the Lakshmi,

27
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:42,566
Lakshmi principle, which is in our Nabhi.

28
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:47,279
Lakshmi principle that is understood,

29
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:51,402
I’ve told you many a time, described Lakshmi to you

30
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,351
that She stands on a lotus

31
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:59,624
and She has two lotuses in Her hands.

32
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:09,631
That means She’s so benevolent, so kind

33
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:13,273
that She doesn’t pressurize anyone.

34
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:16,288
But normally you don’t find that.

35
00:03:16,408 --> 00:03:21,502
Anybody who has money, he’ll just try to pressurize

36
00:03:21,622 --> 00:03:23,432
or try to push down.

37
00:03:23,552 --> 00:03:26,477
Even in Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen people like that.

38
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:30,385
If they are little better off, they try to push people,

39
00:03:30,505 --> 00:03:33,961
organize them, to control them

40
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:37,496
as if they think this is a power they have got

41
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:39,865
out of the money that they have.

42
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:43,545
But She Herself stands on a lotus

43
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:51,349
– that means on the beauty. The beauty of Her being

44
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:56,593
is shown that She doesn’t trouble anyone,

45
00:03:56,713 --> 00:03:59,884
She can stand on a flower.

46
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:05,834
So the first thing, those who have to worship Lakshmi

47
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,073
have to remember one thing

48
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:12,365
that they are not to pressurize anyone,

49
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:19,813
to push anyone, to control anyone or destroy.

50
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:25,060
But She with Her feet on the lotuses nourishes the lotus.

51
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:29,995
In Her two hands She has got lotuses.

52
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:36,042
Lotus is a sign of beauty and they being pink, is love.

53
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:42,696
So what does it symbolize?

54
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:47,397
That a person who has Lakshmi, who has money, who has wealth

55
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:54,345
should be extremely generous, like a lotus which allows

56
00:04:54,465 --> 00:05:07,930
a horrible gnat-like, black, porky, poking type, little beetle

57
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,856
also to come into it and to sleep.

58
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:19,911
And She provides in the lotus a beautiful bed of comfort

59
00:05:20,031 --> 00:05:25,641
to such a person. He is black, he’s got thorns in it,

60
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:29,844
but he’s coming to rest, surrendered.

61
00:05:29,964 --> 00:05:34,006
And then She covers it with Her petals

62
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:39,266
and makes it comfortable and protected.

63
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:46,806
So for a person who has money that should be the temperament,

64
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:50,377
otherwise he loses his money very fast.

65
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:53,419
Or he’s always insecured about his money.

66
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:56,366
He doesn’t know what to do. He wants to put money here,

67
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:58,862
hide there, hide there, hide there.

68
00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:03,581
And there’s no grace about such a person.

69
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:08,203
And the house is such that you never feel comfortable

70
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:11,202
because all the time they’re worried the carpet will be spoiled,

71
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:14,209
this will be spoiled, that will be spoiled, that should not be so.

72
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:17,700
What’s the use of having such a house which gives you a headache?

73
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,761
I mean [it’s] common sense!

74
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:23,842
A house should be such where you can live freely,

75
00:06:23,962 --> 00:06:26,055
at least a house should be like that.

76
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:29,346
But the soon we become materialistic

77
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:32,310
we get out of our Lakshmi principle.

78
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,688
All the beauty of our wealth is finished.

79
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:41,960
I’ve seen people that even a rat doesn’t enter their house,

80
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,130
leave alone human beings.

81
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:49,351
They polish their silver, they polish their brass,

82
00:06:49,471 --> 00:06:52,549
they polish their furniture,

83
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:59,255
their beautiful house is done with beautiful paper,

84
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:03,652
expensive things. But a rat also doesn’t enter.

85
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:10,805
And this is what is the Western materialism is:

86
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:14,902
that we get so much worried about everything.

87
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:17,548
I asked them, “Why are you so much worried?”

88
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:20,209
They said, “Because it’s an investment

89
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:22,490
and we have to sell the house.”

90
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,974
Everything is an investment,

91
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:26,331
they themselves are investments, I think.

92
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:28,282
How will they enjoy?

93
00:07:29,107 --> 00:07:30,553
They cannot enjoy their wealth

94
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:33,846
because everything seems to be an investment.

95
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:36,488
Their head is an investment, their hair investment,

96
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:40,679
nose investment, ears investment, everything is an investment!

97
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,883
What’s the use of becoming human beings?

98
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,948
You are just nothing but investments!

99
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:48,638
Doesn’t matter if the house is little bit sold,

100
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:52,289
you get little less price. What does it matter?

101
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:55,104
After all you have lived in that house.

102
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,281
But I’ve seen that it’s very common

103
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:01,936
that if a guest is sitting and the child spills something,

104
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:05,795
immediately before the guest we’ll start cleaning it.

105
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:08,486
It’s very bad manners.

106
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:13,008
What is this carpet worth than a human being?

107
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:17,173
So the Lakshmi principle is to understand

108
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:23,483
that matter is for expression of your love.

109
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:27,688
How much you do for others,

110
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,751
how much comfort you can give to others.

111
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:34,385
I’ve seen some people, I’ve been to some people

112
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:39,019
that the Gruha Lakshmi, the woman who is in the house,

113
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:41,875
won’t even look after the tea of the people, nothing!!!

114
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:47,080
She’s just enjoying herself and bothering about the carpets

115
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,581
or I don’t know, about the soap, about this.

116
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:52,032
I mean so low level it is,

117
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:56,794
not even, it’s not even a humanistic thing!!!

118
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:02,507
So, Lakshmi principle means love.

119
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,832
This very few people understand.

120
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:11,038
To them Lakshmi means money in the bank. No, doesn’t mean that.

121
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:18,298
It means money or anything like that to express your love.

122
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:28,343
The another symbolic thing about Her is She’s a mother.

123
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:32,601
And mother just gives – nirvajya.

124
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:37,094
She doesn’t charge any interest for what she gives. She just gives.

125
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:42,201
Her enjoyment is giving.

126
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:46,413
I mean I always think what should I cook for you?

127
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:50,175
If I can do this, I can buy this, I can buy this present for you.

128
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:52,353
I mean Diwali is a good day for Me

129
00:09:52,473 --> 00:09:56,403
that I can give you so many things that I want to give you.

130
00:09:56,523 --> 00:10:02,035
And I love it! Nothing like the joy of giving.

131
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:05,465
If you have more things it’s a headache.

132
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,824
It’s a headache. But you think that

133
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:13,286
“I have to buy this thing now. What should I buy for…

134
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:16,761
oh I have to give it to this one, this will fit that person alright.”

135
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:21,290
So it relates to the collective feeling,

136
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:23,811
a very beautiful feeling.

137
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,758
So the Western people have to understand

138
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:33,449
that materialism has gone too far into their heads.

139
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:41,223
Everything to be insured, for what?

140
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:46,439
But in India if we have such people,

141
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,685
I know one or two people are like that, in a,

142
00:10:49,805 --> 00:10:52,046
say, in a city, small city.

143
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,345
Then if they see in the morning these people

144
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:56,603
they’ll go and have a bath!

145
00:10:58,547 --> 00:11:01,250
Or if they are seeing somebody coming from that side,

146
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,439
of that kind, they’ll just go in the other way round.

147
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,155
I asked, “Why is it Baba when that one who is coming…?”

148
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:10,525
“Is a horrible materialistic fellow! Better go this way!”

149
00:11:10,645 --> 00:11:13,081
But here in the West what should you do?

150
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:17,919
Everybody is like that! Where should you hide yourself?

151
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:26,237
So we have to realize, in all introspection we have to realize,

152
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:29,615
that we have gone too much into materialism.

153
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:36,144
That doesn’t mean that you should not make money!

154
00:11:36,264 --> 00:11:38,109
That doesn’t mean you should not work,

155
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:41,785
you should be lethargic, that you should say that

156
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:45,352
“Oh, Mother has said. Now, let us be lotus eaters.'”

157
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,944
Not that. Try to understand!

158
00:11:48,753 --> 00:11:52,764
If you are making money it is just to give.

159
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,055
Then otherwise your situation will be bad,

160
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,472
you’ll be always insecured about money.

161
00:12:00,592 --> 00:12:03,467
And those who have money instead of feeling secured

162
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:07,034
they are the all day shaking like this, I have seen.

163
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:09,650
So what is the use of having?

164
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,468
Is better not to have anything like that that shakes you.

165
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:14,917
Better to settle down with a little hut somewhere

166
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:17,271
and enjoy Sahaja Yoga!

167
00:12:21,795 --> 00:12:24,798
So Lakshmi tattwa is not money-oriented.

168
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:30,764
Supposing you take a dog or take a donkey

169
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:37,380
and put lots of notes on that, will you call him a lakshmipati?

170
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:46,527
Or take another human being who has got ten cars to show off,

171
00:12:46,647 --> 00:12:48,898
who has got a swanky car,

172
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:51,509
and who is nervous, twitchy.

173
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:53,808
Will you call him a lakshmipati?

174
00:12:56,744 --> 00:13:04,973
There is no grace in this kind of money that people have.

175
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:08,392
They are crazy, they have no traditions,

176
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:12,237
they have no sweetness, nothing in them.

177
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:17,068
They are dry, as if the whole juice has been

178
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:20,810
taken out of the sugar cane, they are like that.

179
00:13:21,405 --> 00:13:24,107
And nobody wants to go to such houses.

180
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:29,756
But to be very frank in such houses if I eat, I get vomiting.

181
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,059
My Lakshmi doesn’t like it.

182
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:39,553
So you should feel obliged that you can give to others.

183
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:42,421
You should feel obliged that you can do for others.

184
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,416
This is the first sign of a Sahaja yogi.

185
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:52,759
I shouldn’t say but, what I’ve heard from many people

186
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,389
that people don’t like to spend any money for Sahaja Yoga.

187
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:58,476
They’ll spend for anything else.

188
00:13:58,596 --> 00:14:01,623
They’ll take some, what you call, the face,

189
00:14:01,743 --> 00:14:04,341
what you call them? Cosmetics.

190
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:08,257
Or men may buy something expensive, watches, some things.

191
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:10,839
But for Sahaja Yoga they don’t want to spend.

192
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,803
Now you have to know that Sahaja Yoga is

193
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:18,220
for the emancipation of the whole world.

194
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:26,537
What is this cosmetic going to do for the whole world?

195
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,614
Or your watch, what is it going to do?

196
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:38,233
Or the way you dress up or the way you try to show off,

197
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:40,251
is it going to help the world?

198
00:14:40,371 --> 00:14:45,621
You are here to help the world and not to decorate yourself

199
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:50,697
and just to make advantage of Sahaja Yoga!

200
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:56,038
So it’s very blissful. Sahaja Yoga is extremely blissful.

201
00:14:56,158 --> 00:14:59,010
It gives you first the glimpse of Lakshmi

202
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,376
that it gives you money. You are blessed.

203
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:09,973
And then that is the first temptation

204
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:18,802
and you fall a prey, and you go down.

205
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:30,104
So this Lakshmi principle is to be understood in its proper way.

206
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:32,115
For Sahaja yogis is very important

207
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:35,631
because it is not so superficial as we think.

208
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:42,437
It is much deeper within us and when we touch our depth,

209
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:44,472
it shows.

210
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:53,043
Then there are two other symbols we see.

211
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:57,123
With left hand She gives.

212
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:03,744
I’ve given this simile many a times that, if you open one door

213
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:04,974
the air won’t come in.

214
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:07,364
You have to open the other one so it circulates.

215
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:09,079
She must give.

216
00:16:10,848 --> 00:16:16,249
So all those who have Lakshmi tattwa developed in them,

217
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:18,626
they think what to give.

218
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:23,225
But they don’t give the worst thing that they have.

219
00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:26,197
Just like a waste paper basket is a friend,

220
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:28,475
“Ah! This is useless. I better,

221
00:16:28,595 --> 00:16:31,464
instead of throwing, I can give it to that friend.”

222
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,355
And then friend says, “All right.

223
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:36,548
It’s very nice. I’ll give it to another friend.”

224
00:16:37,636 --> 00:16:41,236
And all friends are used as waste paper baskets.

225
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,256
Whatever is the worst is given.

226
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,768
How can you touch your depth?

227
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,154
Whatever is the best if you can give,

228
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,928
if you are free to give, you should give the best.

229
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:08,334
So, one of the snags is that

230
00:17:08,454 --> 00:17:11,537
we have never learnt the art of giving.

231
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:16,623
If we learn the art of giving then it’s so joyous, so beautiful.

232
00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:24,288
Because we are very ego-oriented,

233
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:27,285
we understand what gives us joy

234
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:30,161
but we don’t understand what will give joy to others.

235
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:34,301
And when we understand what will give joy to others,

236
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:39,939
then that joy reflects on us much more, thousand times.

237
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:47,918
But there is then, as I said,

238
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:50,572
that on the periphery both things work out.

239
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:53,177
From one side are the miserly,

240
00:17:53,297 --> 00:17:56,736
from the other side are the exploiters.

241
00:17:58,387 --> 00:18:02,682
So if you become generous, the exploiters are there.

242
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:09,885
So then an antithesis, another type of people become,

243
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,842
who get nervous, who don’t know what to do, where to go.

244
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:21,927
In Sahaja Yoga you do trust people, all the time.

245
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:26,806
You give. Of course sometimes you are exploited.

246
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,437
So doesn’t matter, that’s not your look out.

247
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:31,096
You have not committed any sin.

248
00:18:31,272 --> 00:18:33,999
The one who has exploited you, he has committed the sin

249
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,639
and he is going to suffer, so why should you worry?

250
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:44,019
But with the help of this divine power,

251
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:48,094
the one who exploits will suffer.

252
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:54,305
And you will get ten times more than what you have lost.

253
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:57,562
This is what it is to be understood by Sahaja yogis.

254
00:18:57,682 --> 00:19:02,060
That we are now blessed by this divine power.

255
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:07,310
We are not alone. All the time it is blessing us.

256
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:16,329
So giving means nothing is mine.

257
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:19,238
“My, my, my, my,” has to be given up.

258
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:24,511
Even in Sahaja Yoga I was surprised

259
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,612
that people in the West who were not attached to their children

260
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:30,486
get very much attached to their children.

261
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,824
And they just think about their children and nothing else.

262
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:41,931
This is another kind of selfishness.

263
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:47,720
If you just think of your own children only and nobody else,

264
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,580
then the same children will become devils

265
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,171
and teach you a lesson.

266
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:58,056
And you’ll say, “Next time, oh God, don’t give me any children,

267
00:19:58,176 --> 00:20:04,991
had enough!” But if you make the child collective

268
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:09,782
and teach child to give others and to enjoy that,

269
00:20:09,902 --> 00:20:12,572
then from the very childhood the child becomes

270
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:15,997
extremely generous.

271
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:22,998
I mean generosity is the quality,

272
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:27,795
is of an incarnation – aishwarya.

273
00:20:28,008 --> 00:20:32,337
Aishwarya doesn’t mean only the money, the wealth,

274
00:20:32,457 --> 00:20:41,106
but generosity excels the money.

275
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:44,405
That is aishwarya, and that is the sign

276
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:48,157
of an incarnation and sign of a Sahaja yogi.

277
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:56,491
The another hand is like this.

278
00:20:57,644 --> 00:21:01,464
That means She gives you protection.

279
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:06,802
If you don’t feel protected with money, throw it away.

280
00:21:06,922 --> 00:21:09,967
Just run away from it. Headache.

281
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,314
But also She gives protection to others.

282
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:18,786
A person who has Lakshmi, he has family,

283
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:23,132
he has children, he has everyone.

284
00:21:25,123 --> 00:21:27,381
The worst thing I’ve seen [is]

285
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:28,523
that in the West

286
00:21:28,643 --> 00:21:32,632
the parents don’t give any money to their children

287
00:21:32,752 --> 00:21:36,413
when they grow up. Then don’t look after them

288
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:38,779
but they are so possessive!

289
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,841
On the contrary, in India

290
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,407
we give all our lives to our children and we are least possessive.

291
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:50,498
And they are even possessive of the grandchildren.

292
00:21:50,618 --> 00:21:53,709
That’s why the families are like this here.

293
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:59,482
So the whole system has gone in a funny way, chaotic.

294
00:21:59,602 --> 00:22:02,874
So it is important for Sahaja yogis to understand

295
00:22:02,994 --> 00:22:08,920
that they will first of all look after their children,

296
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,177
give them whatever they need, nourish them,

297
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:14,594
give them guidance, don’t spoil them.

298
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:21,274
And, secondly, once they are married and have children

299
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:23,198
they will not try to possess them

300
00:22:23,318 --> 00:22:27,020
and possess their children, their wives.

301
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,147
And this protection that is given

302
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:35,973
is the protection of a mother.

303
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:39,413
Say you are working in an office,

304
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:42,139
you’re working in a hospital,

305
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:45,817
you’re working in a factory, anywhere you are working,

306
00:22:45,937 --> 00:22:48,641
all other people who are working under you

307
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:51,618
are your children, are to be treated like that

308
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,502
and they are to feel like that.

309
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,108
They have to feel it’s a family. Try this!

310
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:00,754
My husband, I told him that,

311
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:04,123
“You treat your office as your family.”

312
00:23:04,677 --> 00:23:07,332
So early in the morning they used to arrive from Calcutta,

313
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:10,979
about say five o’clock, by plane.

314
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:15,006
And I would Myself cook their breakfast and give it to them.

315
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:18,086
They were just ordinary clerks.

316
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:24,201
Because this is how through the protection,

317
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:27,268
through the care, through the love

318
00:23:27,998 --> 00:23:31,208
you can make them so dynamic

319
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,774
and that is how the Lakshmi tattwa will increase.

320
00:23:33,894 --> 00:23:36,856
Otherwise there will be strikes, there will be fights.

321
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:39,448
This is the enlightenment!

322
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:46,139
That’s why a person who thinks he is capitalistic

323
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:50,044
must understand that the capital is worth nothing

324
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:53,685
if you don’t know how to use your Lakshmi principle.

325
00:23:54,264 --> 00:23:57,195
That’s why they end up in jail, they end up in lunatic asylums

326
00:23:57,315 --> 00:24:01,016
or they become smugglers or something happens to them.

327
00:24:01,136 --> 00:24:06,148
They just go off. They are never respectable.

328
00:24:06,268 --> 00:24:09,564
And I haven’t seen any statue of a man

329
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:13,340
who has been garlanded for being rich!

330
00:24:18,344 --> 00:24:22,810
So if you are rich, nobody is going to respect you.

331
00:24:23,636 --> 00:24:30,800
But for generosity, something substantial, what you have done.

332
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:37,569
Something substantial – for others, for the society,

333
00:24:38,886 --> 00:24:41,380
for Sahaja Yoga.

334
00:24:43,338 --> 00:24:45,975
We are working out now ashrams

335
00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:49,392
and projects and things and all that

336
00:24:49,741 --> 00:24:51,960
but when it comes to money, Sahaja yogis think,

337
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,090
“Oh no, that’s not my job. Only I can send my child there.

338
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,887
Mother must look after all the children,

339
00:24:58,007 --> 00:25:00,531
Mother must do this, Mother must find out this,

340
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:03,843
She must provide for this.” Everything She should do

341
00:25:03,963 --> 00:25:05,304
and what about me?

342
00:25:05,424 --> 00:25:11,018
I’ll just put money in the banks, Swiss banks specially.”

343
00:25:14,434 --> 00:25:20,003
So one has to decide, “How much of my money I am giving

344
00:25:20,123 --> 00:25:23,333
for the work of Sahaja Yoga?” I don’t want your money.

345
00:25:23,453 --> 00:25:25,811
No money is to be given for Sahaja Yoga, in the sense,

346
00:25:25,931 --> 00:25:29,124
for your realization. But if you have to have a hall,

347
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:30,722
if you have to have a program,

348
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:32,208
if you have to have an ashram,

349
00:25:32,328 --> 00:25:34,115
anything is to be done, you need money.

350
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:37,030
And for that anybody asks, “All right give one pound each”

351
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,613
They won’t give. “No, why should I give one pound?”

352
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:49,471
And there’s a national competition in that,

353
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,554
national competition.

354
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,826
It shows that still you have not touched your depth.

355
00:25:58,946 --> 00:26:02,424
If you touch your depth, you’ll give

356
00:26:02,544 --> 00:26:06,792
and you’ll enjoy your giving. You must touch your depths.

357
00:26:06,912 --> 00:26:10,771
So the enlightenment is yet not complete.

358
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:13,941
Now, I’m saying it to you all individually,

359
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:17,834
you introspect yourself and see for yourself.

360
00:26:21,234 --> 00:26:23,270
Let us see, count how much money

361
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,773
have I given for Sahaja Yoga work,

362
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:32,427
all of us, individually.

363
00:26:34,332 --> 00:26:36,287
Now, you will give Me present,

364
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:38,644
because you think that gives you blessings.

365
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,789
That’s not the point. Point is –

366
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:46,531
“How much money I have kept for Sahaja Yoga out of my income?”

367
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:55,051
This is the first question of Lakshmi principle.

368
00:26:57,646 --> 00:27:00,268
Now, how the Mahalakshmi tattwa comes in?

369
00:27:00,388 --> 00:27:05,693
First the Lakshmi. Lakshmi is born out of the sea.

370
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:10,151
Now, why She was born out of the sea?

371
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:19,504
She was born out of the sea because Her father

372
00:27:19,624 --> 00:27:25,174
is a generous personality. Look at the sea.

373
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:29,879
It spreads its wings all over,

374
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:36,354
gets itself heated up completely so that clouds are made.

375
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:45,789
And these clouds go and bang at those high mountains

376
00:27:46,225 --> 00:27:47,969
where it rains.

377
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:53,028
They form the rivers and then they come back to the sea.

378
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:55,421
But all this, while the sea contains

379
00:27:55,541 --> 00:28:01,547
all the salt within itself, all the salt is within itself.

380
00:28:02,102 --> 00:28:08,046
And then it gives salt. Christ has said, “You are the salt.”

381
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:14,091
What is the salt? Salt, which gives the taste to food,

382
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,244
is your Guru principle.

383
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:21,935
You cannot become a Guru, you cannot become a leader,

384
00:28:22,055 --> 00:28:23,978
if you are a miserly person. You cannot.

385
00:28:24,098 --> 00:28:27,004
How horrible even it looks, just imagine!

386
00:28:30,036 --> 00:28:33,464
So She is born out of the Guru principle.

387
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,303
And this Guru principle starts working in you,

388
00:28:41,423 --> 00:28:45,912
when you have this Lakshmi principle awakened.

389
00:28:46,032 --> 00:28:50,543
Not money, I’m not saying money. Is the Lakshmi principle

390
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,910
when you start thinking,

391
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:57,581
“What sweet thing I should give to another?”

392
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:05,768
When you start thinking, “What should I do for others?”

393
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:17,667
You have to be extremely sweet, soft, not dry, not dry people.

394
00:29:21,072 --> 00:29:24,763
“How to express my love?”

395
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:30,673
So first thing is, as the sea spreads its wings

396
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:35,977
and says, “All right, let the sun take away my water,

397
00:29:36,097 --> 00:29:42,292
let me boil, let it become the clouds.”

398
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:49,550
In the same way you people have to understand

399
00:29:50,764 --> 00:29:57,626
that unless and until I allow the Sun, that’s the Spirit,

400
00:29:58,851 --> 00:30:03,900
to evaporate this water from me, means to give to others,

401
00:30:06,193 --> 00:30:10,157
how will I develop this guru principle within myself?

402
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,469
You cannot have salt in the seawater

403
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:16,044
unless and until you evaporate it.

404
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:21,432
So you cannot become a guru unless and until you allow

405
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:24,834
the evaporation of this water,

406
00:30:24,954 --> 00:30:27,603
of this wealth, the money that you have.

407
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:42,664
But if you are not matured enough, like the sea,

408
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:50,194
then you will remain at a level that, like mad,

409
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:56,616
collecting all the muck of the world

410
00:30:56,736 --> 00:31:00,692
and ultimately end up in some lunatic asylum.

411
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:05,928
Because all maryadas are lost, all dharma is lost.

412
00:31:06,048 --> 00:31:09,352
Without guru principle, how you can have dharma?

413
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:11,956
You do not think of anybody else,

414
00:31:12,076 --> 00:31:14,667
you do not even think of your father, mother or anyone,

415
00:31:14,787 --> 00:31:16,784
you don’t think of your collective work,

416
00:31:16,905 --> 00:31:20,226
you don’t think of the world. That’s too much.

417
00:31:21,385 --> 00:31:25,026
So you become small, small, small, small, small.

418
00:31:28,557 --> 00:31:31,796
But when this Lakshmi tattwa starts,

419
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:38,408
that’s the first inkling of love, love for others.

420
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:42,880
I know you all love Me very much.

421
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:47,656
But it’s not complete reflection of your Mother.

422
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,540
You have to love each other

423
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:56,980
and share everything with each other, with love.

424
00:32:02,011 --> 00:32:09,104
Then this first light of love, Lakshmi, starts showing in you.

425
00:32:10,341 --> 00:32:18,431
In that light when you move, you become very deeply generous,

426
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:21,660
enjoy your generosity.

427
00:32:23,993 --> 00:32:25,727
But I’ve seen

428
00:32:26,273 --> 00:32:28,888
before Sahaja Yoga people don’t care for their children,

429
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:32,619
don’t care for their wives, don’t care for anything.

430
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:36,827
Either they go to the pubs or they have other women kept

431
00:32:36,947 --> 00:32:41,818
or something like that. But after Sahaja Yoga,

432
00:32:41,938 --> 00:32:45,425
like a pendulum, they move to the other extreme.

433
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:49,668
Then their wife is the most important.

434
00:32:49,788 --> 00:32:52,948
Even if she’s a bhoot, anything, she’s the most important thing.

435
00:32:53,068 --> 00:33:00,532
Then the children. Like hawks, they grab their children,

436
00:33:00,652 --> 00:33:04,959
their wife, their house, their things.

437
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:07,148
To them then becomes, “This is the main duty.

438
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:10,382
Mother has said we should have good families.”

439
00:33:10,644 --> 00:33:14,830
But I didn’t say that you become slaves of your families.

440
00:33:15,973 --> 00:33:18,913
I don’t say you break your families,

441
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:23,871
but don’t crush them with your narrowness.

442
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:28,645
Let them grow, let them open out.

443
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,504
So from one extreme to another extreme you move.

444
00:33:36,694 --> 00:33:38,951
You have to come in the center.

445
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:45,774
So this love has to start showing itself,

446
00:33:45,894 --> 00:33:49,348
manifesting itself in all humility.

447
00:33:49,468 --> 00:33:53,227
You are doing it for yourself, you are not doing it for others.

448
00:33:53,347 --> 00:33:56,319
If I’m trying to help somebody with money,

449
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:58,432
I’m trying to help Myself

450
00:33:58,552 --> 00:34:01,952
because I can’t bear that person in trouble,

451
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,582
so, no obligation.

452
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:10,260
And I do it secretly.

453
00:34:11,022 --> 00:34:12,854
I don’t want to talk about it

454
00:34:12,974 --> 00:34:17,673
because I’m enjoying it secretly, I’m enjoying Myself.

455
00:34:17,793 --> 00:34:23,640
I’m not enjoying the idea that I’m doing this for others

456
00:34:27,544 --> 00:34:29,176
but just for Myself.

457
00:34:36,517 --> 00:34:40,939
So the ego part that is within us,

458
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:46,465
which is more bloated with money.

459
00:34:48,663 --> 00:34:51,549
I mean, you can take out a man who has money.

460
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:58,905
They’ll stand off from others. They’re different, you know.

461
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:02,348
Then you think, “Is he coming from lunatic asylum?”

462
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:05,082
“No, no, no, no, he is very rich.”

463
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:07,980
They look as if they are from lunatic asylum,

464
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,874
but they are “No, no, no! They are rich, rich people, very rich!”

465
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,947
They stand in a wing, angular way,

466
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:20,350
look at others in an angular way, very stupid people.

467
00:35:24,698 --> 00:35:27,145
So this is what we have to understand,

468
00:35:27,265 --> 00:35:29,546
that we have come out of one kind of nonsense,

469
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:32,079
we should not jump into another.

470
00:35:35,348 --> 00:35:39,769
And we should see that we are here for Sahaja Yoga.

471
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:42,470
We are specially chosen for Sahaja Yoga.

472
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,197
We have to work out Sahaja Yoga and nothing else.

473
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:47,637
All our family, all our household,

474
00:35:47,757 --> 00:35:51,354
everything, everything is nothing but Sahaja Yoga,

475
00:35:51,474 --> 00:35:56,905
because we are dedicated, that we are deeply into it.

476
00:35:59,174 --> 00:36:02,095
So all these questions I find – women dominating men,

477
00:36:02,215 --> 00:36:05,265
men dominating women – will all disappear

478
00:36:05,385 --> 00:36:06,833
the moment you decide

479
00:36:06,953 --> 00:36:10,157
that we have to awaken Mahalakshmi principle within us.

480
00:36:10,277 --> 00:36:13,368
And the Mahalakshmi principle is the principle

481
00:36:13,488 --> 00:36:17,597
where you start seeking the truth and nothing else.

482
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:25,587
But how can you seek the truth without any light in your hand?

483
00:36:29,364 --> 00:36:35,318
It’s not some sort of an abstract thing or just a drama.

484
00:36:35,438 --> 00:36:39,744
“Oh, I’m seeking the truth with my eyes closed

485
00:36:40,822 --> 00:36:44,671
and with darkness in my hand, I’m seeking the truth!”

486
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:49,805
How can you take to Mahalakshmi principle

487
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:53,450
unless and until the Lakshmi principle is embedded in you?

488
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:57,033
Unless and until you feel that love for each other,

489
00:36:57,153 --> 00:36:59,743
you have felt that love, you have expressed that love,

490
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:01,553
you have been generous,

491
00:37:01,673 --> 00:37:04,995
you have been enjoying the generosity of your own.

492
00:37:05,115 --> 00:37:09,602
Then only you can rise up to that principle of Mahalakshmi

493
00:37:11,213 --> 00:37:13,734
which is the spiritual principle.

494
00:37:18,892 --> 00:37:23,362
And this spiritual principle has been established within us

495
00:37:23,482 --> 00:37:29,162
by penances of all the deities, if you see.

496
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:33,014
See, look at Sita.

497
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:38,885
She was born a daughter of a great king,

498
00:37:39,005 --> 00:37:43,620
married in a family who was so rich.

499
00:37:44,604 --> 00:37:50,055
And She had to go in the jungles without even shoes

500
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,275
and She had to starve Herself for our sake.

501
00:37:57,069 --> 00:38:01,150
And then with all these She suffered,

502
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:06,203
without any comfort She lived

503
00:38:06,323 --> 00:38:10,548
and then was attacked by this horrible Ravana.

504
00:38:11,503 --> 00:38:16,366
She lived with him and kept Her chastity and purity

505
00:38:16,801 --> 00:38:20,316
and then She came out of that ordeal

506
00:38:20,436 --> 00:38:24,794
and She created this Mahalakshmi principle to begin with.

507
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,761
Why did She do it?

508
00:38:32,054 --> 00:38:35,131
She should have succumbed to this Ravana and should have enjoyed.

509
00:38:35,251 --> 00:38:37,941
I mean, normally people would do that.

510
00:38:38,814 --> 00:38:41,643
Why did She suffer so much?

511
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:49,556
Because She had a nobler life to lead to, for our sake.

512
00:38:50,175 --> 00:38:53,894
She had to do that ordeal for our sake.

513
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,949
And She did it.

514
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:03,608
So She was the first incarnation,

515
00:39:03,728 --> 00:39:06,884
we can say, of Mahalakshmi principle.

516
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:15,510
You see Her background and from where to what She went.

517
00:39:18,493 --> 00:39:23,703
Sakshat Mahalakshmi had to go through all these things

518
00:39:23,823 --> 00:39:27,254
to show us that if you want

519
00:39:27,374 --> 00:39:30,217
to have the Mahalakshmi principle within you

520
00:39:30,337 --> 00:39:33,336
then what sort of a woman you should be.

521
00:39:36,566 --> 00:39:40,349
That’s the first we have seen Her in anything.

522
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:45,845
Then who came afterwards than Her, is Radha.

523
00:39:47,901 --> 00:39:50,399
Radha came, Ra-dha. ‘Ra’ is energy,

524
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:53,808
‘dha’ is the one who has sustained, is Radha.

525
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:59,456
If you see Her life,

526
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:07,479
all Her life She worked out our Kundalini – Raasa.

527
00:40:11,407 --> 00:40:20,811
Full of sweetness, full of beautiful generosity,

528
00:40:21,814 --> 00:40:25,125
She danced and danced and danced.

529
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:32,420
Her feet used to pain when Shri Krishna used to rub them.

530
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,328
And She didn’t go with Shri Krishna.

531
00:40:36,448 --> 00:40:40,517
When He became the king She said, “You go, that’s all right.

532
00:40:40,637 --> 00:40:42,112
I’m not [going].

533
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:45,714
I have to still work out Mahalakshmi principle

534
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:48,131
among the gopas and gopis.”

535
00:40:48,693 --> 00:40:52,017
She stayed back in a small place.

536
00:40:53,024 --> 00:40:57,157
But how much surrendered She was to Shri Krishna,

537
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:04,770
how much surrendered She was to the work of Virata.

538
00:41:06,001 --> 00:41:09,973
That She knew, “I have to work out the Virata’s work.”

539
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,090
And She stayed back.

540
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:17,039
There are so many beautiful stories about Her.

541
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:27,374
So this second penance of the Mahalakshmi we know in Radha.

542
00:41:31,142 --> 00:41:35,781
Then the third one came as the Mother of Christ.

543
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:41,967
She gave Her child to be crucified.

544
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:48,537
Will we just introspect ourselves!

545
00:41:48,657 --> 00:41:52,625
How much we are attached like hawks on our children.

546
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,194
If anybody says anything to the children, people don’t like it.

547
00:42:00,233 --> 00:42:03,292
I’ve got reports from Switzerland

548
00:42:03,412 --> 00:42:05,408
that if anybody says anything to the children,

549
00:42:05,528 --> 00:42:08,790
the parents don’t like it. No.

550
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:17,747
Nobody should say anything to their children.

551
00:42:20,845 --> 00:42:23,925
Here She gives Her child

552
00:42:24,045 --> 00:42:30,066
to be crucified for the emancipation of humanity.

553
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:35,731
I can’t even look at the cross.

554
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:44,568
While we are so much attached to our children,

555
00:42:45,346 --> 00:42:51,320
what are we teaching them? Are we teaching them any sacrifices?

556
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,070
Are we teaching them any sharing?

557
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,415
Are we teaching them any tolerance?

558
00:42:57,535 --> 00:43:01,158
Are we teaching them forgiveness?

559
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:06,377
On the contrary, if anybody says anything to the child

560
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:10,745
we don’t like it, leave alone crucifixion,

561
00:43:10,865 --> 00:43:13,661
leave alone even little punishment.

562
00:43:13,781 --> 00:43:18,858
The child has now become the biggest ordeal for Sahaja yogis.

563
00:43:18,978 --> 00:43:22,164
I can tell you, I can see it so clearly.

564
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:26,587
The attachment to children is so great in the West

565
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:29,377
that I am surprised.

566
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:34,261
Everybody gets children, what’s so great about it?

567
00:43:34,381 --> 00:43:36,999
The greatness is what kind of children you are.

568
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,739
Tomorrow these children ……

569
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:42,149
Please move the child that side. Don’t do that. Get out!

570
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:44,623
Please get out and don’t do that in the lectures.

571
00:43:44,743 --> 00:43:48,119
I don’t like women standing here and moving their carts

572
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:52,377
and this… Show some respect! Can you do that in a church?

573
00:43:55,527 --> 00:43:58,740
You see sometimes I do not understand

574
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,249
that a certain protocol also women don’t understand.

575
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:03,461
Please take child out

576
00:44:03,581 --> 00:44:08,147
and don’t keep the thing here, go out! Please tell her.

577
00:44:12,281 --> 00:44:15,950
You don’t take your perambulators in the churches do you,

578
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,089
where there is no Adi Shakti sitting?

579
00:44:22,172 --> 00:44:26,777
Because the principle is mainly your own child,

580
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:30,726
it’s grabbing you, I tell you, it’s grabbing you.

581
00:44:30,846 --> 00:44:34,627
Your children are grabbing you and you are grabbing them.

582
00:44:34,747 --> 00:44:37,385
So we must understand.

583
00:44:37,505 --> 00:44:41,358
Are we allowing our children to grow big?

584
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:46,308
Are they generous? Are they saints?

585
00:44:48,284 --> 00:44:50,494
Are they beautiful?

586
00:44:52,052 --> 00:44:55,562
How do they talk to others? Are they confident?

587
00:44:55,682 --> 00:44:59,759
Tomorrow they are going to be the leaders of Sahaja yogis.

588
00:45:02,878 --> 00:45:05,845
Like Shivaji’s mother, like Jijamata,

589
00:45:06,956 --> 00:45:09,935
how she made the son great!

590
00:45:10,055 --> 00:45:13,343
It’s the mother who makes the children great,

591
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:20,318
and if she wants all the time to sort of a, grab the child

592
00:45:20,438 --> 00:45:25,302
and the child to grab the mother, then it is suicidal,

593
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:29,123
suicidal for you and suicidal for the children.

594
00:45:31,933 --> 00:45:35,230
What have we done about our children?

595
00:45:38,316 --> 00:45:42,837
Is duty of every Sahaja yogi to see that their children grow,

596
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:48,105
grow as great people, greater than you.

597
00:45:49,053 --> 00:45:51,883
They have to look after the world.

598
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,327
If you spend time with your children, see that

599
00:45:58,447 --> 00:46:00,761
you mould them, you nourish them with love

600
00:46:00,881 --> 00:46:04,361
and tell them that they should give love to others.

601
00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:07,935
That they should behave in such a manner

602
00:46:08,055 --> 00:46:12,099
that everybody should feel that love through them.

603
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:20,794
Otherwise they will become devils like Ravana.

604
00:46:20,914 --> 00:46:23,872
Ravana was a realized soul and spoilt by his mother,

605
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:25,994
became a devil.

606
00:46:29,668 --> 00:46:31,897
If you don’t want your children to be devils,

607
00:46:32,017 --> 00:46:34,516
first of all understand that they are not your children,

608
00:46:34,636 --> 00:46:38,529
they are My children, under your trust.

609
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:43,746
And you are not to make your children dwarfish and smalls.

610
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:51,020
This is a new temptation I find in Sahaja Yoga

611
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,474
people are developing, so be careful.

612
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:56,645
I wanted to warn you

613
00:46:56,765 --> 00:46:59,623
because we have to make our children like lights.

614
00:46:59,743 --> 00:47:04,271
Light burns for others, not for itself.

615
00:47:05,842 --> 00:47:08,798
We talk of lights, Diwali, all right, but

616
00:47:08,918 --> 00:47:13,153
these lights are burning for others every moment.

617
00:47:13,273 --> 00:47:17,190
Do we learn from them? Are we burning for others?

618
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:20,432
Are our children going to burn for the others?

619
00:47:20,552 --> 00:47:23,920
You are making them so selfish.

620
00:47:26,871 --> 00:47:30,282
So thousands and thousands of children are going to come.

621
00:47:30,402 --> 00:47:35,074
And even when they are born realized, I’ve seen you spoil them.

622
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,220
I mean, if you take a diamond and put it in a gutter

623
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,342
it will be lost. It’s like that.

624
00:47:42,937 --> 00:47:45,473
Even if you have the best children, you can ruin them

625
00:47:45,593 --> 00:47:47,619
by this kind of stupid idea that,

626
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:51,247
“That’s my child, this is mine.”

627
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:56,442
Expose your children to good things.

628
00:47:56,562 --> 00:48:00,632
Tell them what is good. Tell them how to be good to others,

629
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,053
tell them to look after them,

630
00:48:02,173 --> 00:48:04,564
tell them how to press the feet of others,

631
00:48:04,684 --> 00:48:08,568
how to comb the hair, how to give food to others.

632
00:48:08,688 --> 00:48:15,461
Teach them! Let them carry little trays and feed others,

633
00:48:15,581 --> 00:48:20,837
to the birds, let them give water to the flowers.

634
00:48:22,201 --> 00:48:26,301
Don’t make them small.

635
00:48:26,421 --> 00:48:28,926
Some of the children are really dynamic,

636
00:48:29,046 --> 00:48:32,263
great saints born to you, but you are ruining them

637
00:48:32,383 --> 00:48:34,192
and I have to warn you about it that,

638
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:37,505
in Mahalakshmi tattwa, if you have to now give it to them,

639
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:42,526
please remember that all these great incarnations of Mahalakshmi

640
00:48:42,646 --> 00:48:44,378
had to go through such ordeal.

641
00:48:44,498 --> 00:48:47,159
So what is the incarnation of Mary teaches us?

642
00:48:47,279 --> 00:48:49,431
Many people say, “Oh what was Mary? After all,

643
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:53,039
She was just nothing.” Look at the incarnation of Mary.

644
00:48:53,159 --> 00:49:02,845
What does She teach us? You are supposed to be Christians.

645
00:49:02,965 --> 00:49:06,894
You are supposed to be Hindus. Supposed.

646
00:49:07,014 --> 00:49:11,373
But what do they teach us these Mahalakshmi principles?

647
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:18,117
The last Mahalakshmi principle came as Fatima.

648
00:49:19,632 --> 00:49:24,305
Fatima, the Gruha Lakshmi, She stayed at home.

649
00:49:24,425 --> 00:49:29,017
She didn’t show off. She was not the one who went out.

650
00:49:29,137 --> 00:49:31,566
She stayed at home, looked after household,

651
00:49:31,686 --> 00:49:35,818
looked after their children and made them two great warriors.

652
00:49:35,938 --> 00:49:39,164
Her children and Her husband, they fought for the right,

653
00:49:39,284 --> 00:49:41,858
they fought for the truth.

654
00:49:47,255 --> 00:49:49,081
She was a Gruha Lakshmi.

655
00:49:49,201 --> 00:49:53,639
I’ve seen, I’m sometimes very much amazed also,

656
00:49:53,759 --> 00:49:58,295
that if you see the television, [when] a child is lost

657
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:01,045
is the mother who speaks, the father does not.

658
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:04,104
He seems more shocked than the mother.

659
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:06,851
Mother is trying to show off

660
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:09,414
because she thinks in the television she will be seen.

661
00:50:09,534 --> 00:50:11,826
She’s forgotten her pain, she’s forgotten everything.

662
00:50:11,946 --> 00:50:14,774
She is the one who is speaking, the father is quiet.

663
00:50:14,894 --> 00:50:16,712
He’s much more shocked than the mother.

664
00:50:16,832 --> 00:50:22,589
Is a common thing you see. Normally a mother should be shocked.

665
00:50:26,605 --> 00:50:30,140
So what is the principle of Mahalakshmi?

666
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:34,445
Is that first is of sacrifice.

667
00:50:36,286 --> 00:50:45,828
Sacrifice their own children on the altar of truth.

668
00:50:46,573 --> 00:50:49,958
Of course that is not needed in Sahaja Yoga.

669
00:50:50,078 --> 00:50:51,287
You are all blessed people,

670
00:50:51,407 --> 00:50:54,790
you don’t have to sacrifice anything whatsoever.

671
00:50:54,910 --> 00:51:03,622
But if you do not develop your children into proper ways,

672
00:51:03,742 --> 00:51:07,184
they will hold you responsible

673
00:51:10,373 --> 00:51:17,127
and they will say, “Why did you not give us a full scope to develop?”

674
00:51:21,182 --> 00:51:25,025
If you find your child is obstinate,

675
00:51:25,145 --> 00:51:30,131
if you find your child is miserly,

676
00:51:30,251 --> 00:51:34,605
if you find your child he doesn’t know how to share love with others

677
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:38,824
or dominating, try to curb it down immediately.

678
00:51:38,944 --> 00:51:42,526
Children are very clever, extremely clever.

679
00:51:42,646 --> 00:51:46,015
The moment they realize that they will lose your love,

680
00:51:46,135 --> 00:51:48,332
they behave themselves.

681
00:51:52,514 --> 00:51:56,512
So this Mahalakshmi principle has to grow among men,

682
00:51:56,632 --> 00:52:00,212
as well as in women. We have families now

683
00:52:00,332 --> 00:52:02,524
and this has to work out, that,

684
00:52:02,644 --> 00:52:06,965
do the whole family people sit down and meditate?

685
00:52:09,204 --> 00:52:15,317
Do we teach our children the proper protocol of Shri Mataji?

686
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:20,035
Like a lady bringing a perambulator in the hall – is absurd!

687
00:52:20,155 --> 00:52:26,152
I mean, can you bring a perambulator in the church?

688
00:52:31,247 --> 00:52:32,857
This is more than a church.

689
00:52:32,977 --> 00:52:36,488
Do you realize whom are you facing?

690
00:52:41,345 --> 00:52:44,191
And this is what you have to tell your children

691
00:52:44,311 --> 00:52:48,024
because this is the greatest time.

692
00:52:48,144 --> 00:52:50,852
This is the greatest time when you are here,

693
00:52:50,972 --> 00:52:53,030
the greatest time of spirituality,

694
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:58,194
of the complete manifestation of the powers of the Goddess,

695
00:52:58,314 --> 00:53:03,938
where your children have to be the real flowers of beauty.

696
00:53:04,058 --> 00:53:13,319
Please don’t try to cover them up with their souls dying out there

697
00:53:13,439 --> 00:53:16,691
under the cover of so-called love for them.

698
00:53:18,334 --> 00:53:22,237
So we have now three principles of Mahalakshmi that we have seen.

699
00:53:22,357 --> 00:53:24,682
And the fourth one is Myself.

700
00:53:30,482 --> 00:53:35,765
Mine is a much deeper work,

701
00:53:37,336 --> 00:53:42,885
much wider and tremendous patience is needed.

702
00:53:44,392 --> 00:53:49,104
It won’t work out if I sacrifice anyone.

703
00:53:49,224 --> 00:53:52,706
I have to sacrifice Myself.

704
00:53:53,665 --> 00:53:57,877
I have to sacrifice My family, so-called.

705
00:53:57,997 --> 00:54:00,983
I have to sacrifice My sleep,

706
00:54:01,103 --> 00:54:06,574
sacrifice comforts, everything possible under the sun.

707
00:54:06,694 --> 00:54:09,350
I have to sacrifice for one reason

708
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:13,457
that, your Mahalakshmi tattwa should be manifested.

709
00:54:13,577 --> 00:54:16,239
It should have its fruits.

710
00:54:17,326 --> 00:54:21,648
So you came to Sahaja Yoga as the seekers of truth,

711
00:54:21,768 --> 00:54:25,367
blessed by Mahalakshmi principle already

712
00:54:26,025 --> 00:54:31,989
and if that is so, let us feel it.

713
00:54:32,109 --> 00:54:34,368
We love our Mother. Why? Why do we love?

714
00:54:34,488 --> 00:54:38,205
Why do we love Her? Because She loves us.

715
00:54:38,325 --> 00:54:44,821
But love doesn’t mean without any effort,

716
00:54:47,612 --> 00:54:52,416
without any work, without any sacrifice.

717
00:54:52,536 --> 00:54:55,253
I don’t feel the sacrifice.

718
00:54:55,373 --> 00:55:00,340
I don’t feel at all anything like that.

719
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:04,219
Outwardly many people say, “Mother, how much You are traveling!

720
00:55:04,339 --> 00:55:07,945
Mother, how much You are doing this!” I don’t feel that

721
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,817
because I enjoy it.

722
00:55:13,237 --> 00:55:16,044
And that is what it is important.

723
00:55:16,164 --> 00:55:21,664
If we have to develop our full personality,

724
00:55:21,784 --> 00:55:28,513
we have to know that our love should not be only a lip service.

725
00:55:30,171 --> 00:55:31,753
We have to work.

726
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:38,519
I’ve seen people when it comes to working for Sahaja Yoga,

727
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:41,109
they just run away. Where are they?

728
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:43,168
Nobody is available, all are out.

729
00:55:43,288 --> 00:55:47,520
Only five, six people are working. And where the rest are?

730
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:51,326
“Oh, they’ll only come Mother when You will come.”

731
00:55:56,435 --> 00:56:01,232
What work have you put in? What effort we have put in?

732
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:05,945
We, just we are enjoying ourselves, all right.

733
00:56:06,588 --> 00:56:09,450
But enjoyment without any effort,

734
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:16,789
enjoyment without any sacrifice cannot be complete.

735
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:21,200
If you are attached to your comfort, to your laziness,

736
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,346
to your selfishness and all that,

737
00:56:23,466 --> 00:56:27,922
of course that will be there, but you cannot enjoy.

738
00:56:28,517 --> 00:56:30,452
You cannot enjoy.

739
00:56:30,572 --> 00:56:33,943
You’ll only enjoy when you just care for enjoyment

740
00:56:34,063 --> 00:56:37,019
and the rest of it is finished.

741
00:56:38,257 --> 00:56:41,395
Now before you is your Mother.

742
00:56:44,451 --> 00:56:46,837
I’ve seen yesterday people were sleepy.

743
00:56:46,957 --> 00:56:50,206
Today also there are many who are sleepy, sitting here,

744
00:56:50,326 --> 00:56:52,789
can’t open their eyes.

745
00:56:55,353 --> 00:57:00,882
Why? Because they’re not yet in it.

746
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:07,287
But for Me, I can keep awake for three nights,

747
00:57:07,407 --> 00:57:10,338
ten nights, twelve nights,

748
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:16,311
and I can sleep for one hour or for one year, if I want.

749
00:57:17,112 --> 00:57:22,223
Because everything is under command. Why is it in command?

750
00:57:22,343 --> 00:57:27,757
Because I love. This is the power of love.

751
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:32,653
The power of love gives you complete command over everything,

752
00:57:33,407 --> 00:57:39,406
over your body, your mind, over your ego, over everything.

753
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,086
Complete command, power of love.

754
00:57:44,832 --> 00:57:50,303
Now I went to Greece

755
00:57:50,423 --> 00:57:52,705
and you know what things I brought from there.

756
00:57:52,825 --> 00:57:55,621
And then we went into this shop to buy some things

757
00:57:55,741 --> 00:57:59,286
for your Diwali Puja. But they were so expensive!

758
00:57:59,406 --> 00:58:03,296
I said, “No, no, no, no, it’s too much, too much.”

759
00:58:03,827 --> 00:58:06,291
But they’ll buy something.

760
00:58:06,862 --> 00:58:12,766
We found out that, that was sold in here in Italy.

761
00:58:12,886 --> 00:58:16,566
But can you believe that is sold in Padova?

762
00:58:16,686 --> 00:58:20,895
When you are having your puja here,

763
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:26,113
the presents are sold here at a very cheap price, ten times less!

764
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:32,841
Now who has arranged all this? This power of love.

765
00:58:32,961 --> 00:58:40,048
If you love someone without any expectations,

766
00:58:40,168 --> 00:58:46,506
then this power of love just floods you with things,

767
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:49,661
with ideas, with everything.

768
00:58:50,336 --> 00:58:56,106
But just try to understand. It should be pure love,

769
00:58:56,645 --> 00:59:00,473
without thinking, pure love,

770
00:59:01,187 --> 00:59:10,906
just a feeling that I’m enjoying it, anything.

771
00:59:12,498 --> 00:59:16,891
The whole day I went there and Hamir was quite upset

772
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:19,886
that Mother, poor thing, had to be without food, had to do.

773
00:59:20,006 --> 00:59:22,668
But I was just enjoying.

774
00:59:24,121 --> 00:59:26,092
He was feeling that I’m working so hard.

775
00:59:26,212 --> 00:59:29,484
I didn’t feel that way, just enjoying.

776
00:59:31,595 --> 00:59:34,830
But this enjoyment is not possible for a person

777
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:39,526
who has not become the pure love. Is that the trouble is.

778
00:59:39,646 --> 00:59:45,355
The source of enjoyment is this power of love

779
00:59:46,257 --> 00:59:51,604
and it won’t fill the heart which does not have love.

780
00:59:54,794 --> 00:59:56,584
As simple as that.

781
00:59:56,704 --> 01:00:04,213
So when we are celebrating here today, these lights are what?

782
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:13,657
They love. They are burning just to give you the joy.

783
01:00:14,474 --> 01:00:19,655
Even flowers, even fruits, the whole nature.

784
01:00:19,775 --> 01:00:23,875
What can the Fruits do, we eat them, we enjoy them.

785
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:27,934
They like it. What do the flowers? They come out

786
01:00:28,054 --> 01:00:31,384
for a short time, they live, we bring them here,

787
01:00:31,504 --> 01:00:35,555
we spread them, we enjoy them. They are happy about it.

788
01:00:36,109 --> 01:00:39,120
They’re happy that they’re touching Mother’s feet.

789
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,382
But what they’re going to disappear tomorrow.

790
01:00:41,502 --> 01:00:45,830
They’re going to die tomorrow. They’re not going to live long.

791
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:49,152
But this is the greatest moment for them.

792
01:00:51,977 --> 01:00:55,143
They ask a flower, “What do you want?”

793
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:59,067
Said, “I don’t want any kingdom, I don’t want anything

794
01:00:59,187 --> 01:01:01,743
but the road on which Adi Shakti is going to walk,

795
01:01:01,863 --> 01:01:05,824
please throw me there. That’s all. That’s all I want.”

796
01:01:05,944 --> 01:01:11,199
What is such enjoyment in that,

797
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:14,851
that we don’t want any kingdom, we don’t want anything, nothing?

798
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:20,445
What is that in there? Is the pouring of this love into you.

799
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:23,255
Completely filling you up.

800
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:29,548
That it is so evident you can see it,

801
01:01:29,668 --> 01:01:35,300
living example before you. That’s how I’ve lived all My life.

802
01:01:36,014 --> 01:01:38,032
I don’t feel sleepy.

803
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:42,362
You’ve never seen Me sleeping in any program, have I?

804
01:01:42,482 --> 01:01:44,476
But I can see many even now sleeping.

805
01:01:44,596 --> 01:01:50,690
I mean you have to wake them up. I can’t understand.

806
01:01:51,023 --> 01:01:55,170
Because their hearts are not open.

807
01:01:57,099 --> 01:02:00,262
If they open their heart, they can’t sleep,

808
01:02:00,382 --> 01:02:06,243
even if they want to. They’re sitting before Me,

809
01:02:06,363 --> 01:02:09,812
why should they close their eyes after all?

810
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:12,656
Is the most surprising thing

811
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:15,397
that they’ll go and touch the feet of My photograph

812
01:02:15,517 --> 01:02:18,205
and before Me they will sleep.

813
01:02:21,714 --> 01:02:23,962
It’s absurd!

814
01:02:24,082 --> 01:02:28,769
So you must know, all of you have got that depth.

815
01:02:28,889 --> 01:02:30,670
All have that beauty within you

816
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:34,229
but you should be intelligent enough to see this point

817
01:02:34,697 --> 01:02:41,441
that, have we touched that point? Are we lost in that point?

818
01:02:41,561 --> 01:02:42,626
Now you introspect.

819
01:02:42,746 --> 01:02:45,426
What I’m saying don’t think of others, think of yourself.

820
01:02:45,546 --> 01:02:47,908
Have we got that?

821
01:02:49,251 --> 01:02:53,209
On this day of Diwali looking at these beautiful lights

822
01:02:53,329 --> 01:02:55,527
which will disappear,

823
01:02:56,448 --> 01:03:01,159
even a moment of that think that they are, they’re so happy.

824
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:06,230
So have we touched our, that beautiful thing

825
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:10,231
which is eternal within us? Have we touched it?

826
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:14,679
You ask anyone, “Do you meditate?”

827
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:18,823
You eat your food, all right.

828
01:03:18,943 --> 01:03:24,017
I asked you about meditation, why is it so?

829
01:03:27,831 --> 01:03:30,287
Do you look after yourself?

830
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:38,157
What are you looking at, wasting our lives?

831
01:03:38,277 --> 01:03:43,118
Every moment is so precious, every day is so precious,

832
01:03:43,238 --> 01:03:45,469
every year so precious.

833
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:51,379
Sahaja Yoga is progressing very fast and you people have to decide

834
01:03:51,499 --> 01:03:57,657
that now your Mahalakshmi tattwa has to give its fruits.

835
01:03:57,777 --> 01:04:02,503
Let’s see. I was happy to see you so happy, joyous.

836
01:04:03,813 --> 01:04:06,717
I wish you could give this joy to each other.

837
01:04:06,837 --> 01:04:09,729
That gives Me the greatest pleasure.

838
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,636
Of course now there aren’t much fights and nothing’s going on but

839
01:04:14,756 --> 01:04:17,512
there are small, small things where I find

840
01:04:17,632 --> 01:04:21,749
people have funny feelings about each other.

841
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:26,375
So forget about it. You are Sahaja yogis.

842
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:29,768
After all, what is going to happen?

843
01:04:29,888 --> 01:04:32,803
Everybody has to die in any case.

844
01:04:32,923 --> 01:04:39,846
But at least you led a life of spirituality, of eternity.

845
01:04:39,966 --> 01:04:42,749
See, look at them. They all know they have to die but,

846
01:04:42,869 --> 01:04:46,520
“Let’s burn as much as we can.”

847
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:53,350
We have the light. Everybody doesn’t have the light. “Let’s burn.”

848
01:04:56,834 --> 01:05:00,799
This is to be understood and then you’ll enjoy.

849
01:05:00,919 --> 01:05:05,188
Even the shortest life which is like a shooting star

850
01:05:05,308 --> 01:05:13,637
is worth something than a boring life of a dead person.

851
01:05:20,859 --> 01:05:24,324
The child is crying tell her to take away the child.

852
01:05:30,872 --> 01:05:38,770
So for this, the protocol has to be understood.

853
01:05:40,587 --> 01:05:43,450
It’s very important to understand protocol

854
01:05:43,799 --> 01:05:50,253
and the protocol is this, that you are not to question Me.

855
01:05:51,771 --> 01:05:56,054
You are not to question Me, you are not to doubt Me.

856
01:05:56,174 --> 01:06:00,769
This is very important if you have to keep your Sahastrara open.

857
01:06:02,007 --> 01:06:07,568
If you have any doubts, then know that you are not yet there.

858
01:06:07,688 --> 01:06:10,833
Please keep your Sahastrara open.

859
01:06:10,953 --> 01:06:16,191
Without your Sahastrara being open you cannot do anything.

860
01:06:16,311 --> 01:06:20,696
Surrender means nothing but keep your Sahastrara open.

861
01:06:20,816 --> 01:06:24,016
This is the way you are going to grow.

862
01:06:24,136 --> 01:06:27,139
What are you going to surrender to Me?

863
01:06:27,259 --> 01:06:31,508
I can create the whole world like I create worlds after worlds.

864
01:06:31,628 --> 01:06:37,298
What are you going to give Me? But just surrender.

865
01:06:39,076 --> 01:06:41,494
You have to give nothing to Mother,

866
01:06:41,614 --> 01:06:44,108
you have to be one with Her,

867
01:06:44,228 --> 01:06:46,270
you have to be lost in Her,

868
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:50,218
is to enjoy Her, to know Her.

869
01:06:51,798 --> 01:06:53,435
That is the day

870
01:06:53,555 --> 01:06:56,337
when there will be a perfect Diwali in this whole world.

871
01:06:56,457 --> 01:07:01,396
I’ll see My children becoming great lights

872
01:07:01,516 --> 01:07:06,465
of knowledge, truth, peace and joy.

873
01:07:06,965 --> 01:07:10,161
That is the day I’m going to feel

874
01:07:10,281 --> 01:07:13,315
that we have done the job alright.

875
01:07:15,649 --> 01:07:19,167
And let’s have that real Diwali.

876
01:07:19,287 --> 01:07:22,753
And I’m sure it’s going to be very soon.

877
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:27,487
Why not compete with other countries in this like Russia,

878
01:07:27,607 --> 01:07:34,865
like Bulgaria instead of competing in nonsense.

879
01:07:34,985 --> 01:07:39,301
Let’s compete. How many Sahaja Yogis we have got?

880
01:07:40,818 --> 01:07:45,062
What have we got to be given for Sahaja Yoga?

881
01:07:48,771 --> 01:07:55,437
All this will create such a beautiful personality of self respect

882
01:07:55,557 --> 01:07:57,989
because unless and until you have Self-knowledge

883
01:07:58,109 --> 01:08:00,928
you cannot have respect for it. But now you have Self-knowledge

884
01:08:01,048 --> 01:08:04,057
so the whole thing is going to change.

885
01:08:04,177 --> 01:08:06,371
Today I wanted to speak to you more than the puja.

886
01:08:06,491 --> 01:08:09,840
Is a short puja, is not a very big puja for Lakshmi

887
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,272
because is already within you.

888
01:08:12,392 --> 01:08:16,554
But in this short puja I wanted to speak to you

889
01:08:16,674 --> 01:08:21,144
that now you must respect the Mahalakshmi tattwa.

890
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,428
Now Mahalakshmi tattwa has got four sides.

891
01:08:23,548 --> 01:08:27,543
Is the first is the Lakshmi tattwa which I told you is the love,

892
01:08:27,663 --> 01:08:31,538
to express your Lakshmi principle, to be generous.

893
01:08:31,658 --> 01:08:35,066
Then we have got the Raja Lakshmi.

894
01:08:35,186 --> 01:08:40,087
Raja Lakshmi principle is that you are like a king

895
01:08:40,207 --> 01:08:46,141
“I am the realized soul, so what! I’m like a king!”

896
01:08:46,261 --> 01:08:48,963
The kings don’t beg, do they?

897
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:52,061
I mean if they beg then they are beggars, they are not kings.

898
01:08:52,181 --> 01:08:56,059
Of course these days I don’t know what the kings are doing.

899
01:08:56,695 --> 01:09:04,335
But, we are kings, we are royal. We walk like royal people.

900
01:09:05,597 --> 01:09:08,643
I mean I see people sometimes

901
01:09:09,087 --> 01:09:12,486
walking in a manner that doesn’t behove a Sahaja yogi,

902
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:16,269
living in a manner that doesn’t behove a Sahaja yogi.

903
01:09:17,809 --> 01:09:22,553
We have to walk with the dignity of a king.

904
01:09:23,252 --> 01:09:26,289
And the king is the one who gives, who doesn’t take anything.

905
01:09:26,409 --> 01:09:29,204
Is the Raja Lakshmi principle in you, has to come,

906
01:09:29,324 --> 01:09:31,537
in all the ladies.

907
01:09:32,036 --> 01:09:37,846
You see so, also ladies should not give way to fashions.

908
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:39,682
If you start changing your fashions

909
01:09:39,802 --> 01:09:43,208
that means you are not at all from the royal family.

910
01:09:43,328 --> 01:09:45,791
I went to Japan. You’ll be surprised,

911
01:09:45,911 --> 01:09:48,534
they were very respectful to us, extremely respectful.

912
01:09:48,654 --> 01:09:51,487
I couldn’t understand, you know, Me and My daughters.

913
01:09:51,607 --> 01:09:53,308
So we asked the interpreter. I said,

914
01:09:53,428 --> 01:09:55,058
“Why are they so respectful to us?

915
01:09:55,178 --> 01:09:58,661
Everywhere we went they gave us the present and bowed to us?”

916
01:09:58,781 --> 01:10:01,498
He said, “Because they think You are from royal family.”

917
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:04,509
I said, “Why, why do they think we are from royal family?”

918
01:10:04,629 --> 01:10:06,948
“Because You comb Your hair so well

919
01:10:07,068 --> 01:10:11,562
and that You don’t go to any hairdresser.

920
01:10:11,682 --> 01:10:15,427
Royal family people never go to any hairdresser get their heads to.

921
01:10:15,547 --> 01:10:17,469
Because Your hair are so well done.

922
01:10:17,589 --> 01:10:21,011
That’s why they think You must be from the royal family.”

923
01:10:21,131 --> 01:10:23,696
Can you imagine? While we are like bhoots,

924
01:10:23,816 --> 01:10:26,843
how can we be Sahaja yogis?

925
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:30,427
Tomorrow you have to wear the crowns.

926
01:10:30,547 --> 01:10:32,549
We should not have dresses like beggars.

927
01:10:32,669 --> 01:10:37,218
Do you think so that’s the sign of a royal family person?

928
01:10:37,338 --> 01:10:43,709
You must dress up well, neat, clean, not like a sanyasi,

929
01:10:43,829 --> 01:10:50,565
colorful, beautiful but with dignity.

930
01:10:52,484 --> 01:10:54,801
It should not be a fashion.

931
01:10:54,921 --> 01:11:01,135
Fashion is taken by ordinary people, by vulgar [people].

932
01:11:01,469 --> 01:11:05,110
King doesn’t take the fashion, does he?

933
01:11:06,149 --> 01:11:11,107
He creates the fashion. He doesn’t take fashions.

934
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:14,144
So you play into the hands of the fashions, this…

935
01:11:14,264 --> 01:11:16,241
Recently I heard the fashion is

936
01:11:16,361 --> 01:11:18,506
for women is to have their hair here.

937
01:11:18,626 --> 01:11:23,660
Why? Closing the Agnya like that?

938
01:11:27,499 --> 01:11:31,814
If you are playing into the hands of these modern entrepreneurs

939
01:11:31,934 --> 01:11:33,832
and modern ideas and all those things,

940
01:11:33,952 --> 01:11:36,723
then know that you have no a personality of a Sahaja yogi.

941
01:11:36,843 --> 01:11:40,195
A Sahaja yogi has his own personality.

942
01:11:40,315 --> 01:11:43,005
He doesn’t change according to somebody says, “All right,

943
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:46,486
everybody is like this, so you should be like that.”

944
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:52,254
He has his own style and he has own ways of dressing up.

945
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:57,021
In everyday life also a royal person is such,

946
01:11:57,141 --> 01:12:00,175
the whole dignity of a royal person.

947
01:12:00,295 --> 01:12:01,917
You don’t take money from others.

948
01:12:02,037 --> 01:12:04,467
You don’t borrow money from others.

949
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:07,105
Do you think the king, the day he starts borrowing money,

950
01:12:07,225 --> 01:12:09,884
he’ll no more be a king.

951
01:12:13,102 --> 01:12:17,297
Then a royal person always talks with a dignity

952
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:20,549
as well as respect of the dignity of others.

953
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:34,005
He doesn’t use cheap words, slangs. Royal language he uses.

954
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:41,631
Now these slangs I do not know,

955
01:12:41,751 --> 01:12:44,324
I do not know much about them

956
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:51,577
but is very much in the fashion that you go on in a slangy way.

957
01:12:51,697 --> 01:12:58,114
You ask somebody some questions “eaah! eaah!”

958
01:12:58,234 --> 01:13:01,765
Is this the way a king would speak?

959
01:13:05,919 --> 01:13:09,342
I tell you in every behavior,

960
01:13:09,462 --> 01:13:12,794
if you know that you are the king and you are the queen,

961
01:13:12,914 --> 01:13:17,385
the whole personality will change.

962
01:13:17,505 --> 01:13:21,046
But a beggar, if you bring the beggar and put him on the chair of a king,

963
01:13:21,166 --> 01:13:25,584
still he is, anybody coming, “Please give me something.”

964
01:13:27,053 --> 01:13:30,908
Wearing the crown he says “Oh, Please get me..”

965
01:13:33,321 --> 01:13:38,525
Now you are sitting on the thrones.

966
01:13:38,645 --> 01:13:45,564
In Sanskrit word is, in Hindi they say, virargj, virargji.

967
01:13:45,684 --> 01:13:49,631
Let this kingdom show through your behavior.

968
01:13:49,751 --> 01:13:56,164
The kingdom of God, show in your behavior.

969
01:13:56,284 --> 01:14:00,606
If you are a miserable creature, a TB patient,

970
01:14:00,726 --> 01:14:05,316
how can you be of the royal family?

971
01:14:07,086 --> 01:14:12,675
If you are a lanky-panky person how can you wear your swords?

972
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:16,505
The other day they gave Me one sword to hold.

973
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:20,507
I tell you many of you cannot hold it, it’s so heavy.

974
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:23,686
But in My Royal Spirit, I can.

975
01:14:26,273 --> 01:14:27,855
Same with the ladies

976
01:14:27,975 --> 01:14:32,313
if they have to wear the dresses of a royal family.

977
01:14:32,433 --> 01:14:39,256
Even to wear the crown you have to have a head that is capable.

978
01:14:41,201 --> 01:14:44,346
So that royal nature has to come in your own behavior,

979
01:14:44,466 --> 01:14:48,000
when you talk to others and anyone.

980
01:14:49,873 --> 01:14:54,042
Like royal people never ask questions, never.

981
01:14:54,162 --> 01:14:57,324
“Hmm,” they will say. “Hmm.”

982
01:14:59,593 --> 01:15:01,433
But a beggar will ask a question.

983
01:15:01,553 --> 01:15:06,397
We call him a sawali, the one who ask a question all the time.

984
01:15:08,373 --> 01:15:10,833
But why should a king ask when he knows all the answers.

985
01:15:10,953 --> 01:15:14,128
Why should he ask for any questions?

986
01:15:16,183 --> 01:15:18,799
I know some people who are such headaches.

987
01:15:18,919 --> 01:15:24,575
Now say I’m in the road. “Will You take white water or blue water?”

988
01:15:24,695 --> 01:15:29,109
“Baba, I take water whether blue, white anything and that’s all.”

989
01:15:29,229 --> 01:15:31,799
Then they’ll say, “Will You take a white comb or a red comb?”

990
01:15:31,919 --> 01:15:34,522
“Arey bhai, give anything.”

991
01:15:35,236 --> 01:15:38,330
By their asking only you get fed up that “I don’t want anything.

992
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,895
Now get out of the road, please.”

993
01:15:42,514 --> 01:15:47,536
Then another style is, “I have a problema, a problema.”

994
01:15:47,656 --> 01:15:52,341
Nothing problem, problema. “What is the problema?”

995
01:15:52,461 --> 01:15:56,216
“I don’t know how to carry on with my job.”

996
01:15:56,779 --> 01:16:01,043
Problema. Because you are a problem, that must be this problema.

997
01:16:01,163 --> 01:16:03,145
But Mother doesn’t say, it’s all right.

998
01:16:03,266 --> 01:16:06,843
She will suggest one thing. “But in this, this”,

999
01:16:06,963 --> 01:16:10,044
then She suggests another solution. “But in this, this”,

1000
01:16:10,164 --> 01:16:11,722
then suggests three solutions.

1001
01:16:11,842 --> 01:16:14,510
She will go on suggesting ten solutions.

1002
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:17,068
Still you will forget it’s your problem,

1003
01:16:17,188 --> 01:16:20,684
you think it’s Mother’s problem you are discussing.

1004
01:16:22,104 --> 01:16:25,315
This is not the way the king is. The king gives solutions,

1005
01:16:25,435 --> 01:16:28,675
he doesn’t ask for solutions.

1006
01:16:28,795 --> 01:16:31,830
Otherwise should he be king?

1007
01:16:34,941 --> 01:16:39,069
And once you decide, “I am the king and I am going to solve my problems,”

1008
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:41,976
the problems should be solved like this.

1009
01:16:42,096 --> 01:16:44,511
Do I tell you My problems any time?

1010
01:16:44,631 --> 01:16:48,870
I never use this word also – problem. This is a modern word.

1011
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:51,438
‘Problem’ we used to only use in mathematics,

1012
01:16:51,558 --> 01:16:56,830
I think in geometry so far, really!

1013
01:16:58,314 --> 01:17:02,454
We didn’t know that it was used in general life.

1014
01:17:02,574 --> 01:17:05,994
So if you are the king you solve your problem.

1015
01:17:06,115 --> 01:17:08,442
If you solve your problem, then you are a king.

1016
01:17:08,562 --> 01:17:12,866
If you cannot solve your problem then you are a beggar.

1017
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,743
Then cheap things.

1018
01:17:19,648 --> 01:17:23,533
To use cheap material, cheap things, cheap language,

1019
01:17:23,653 --> 01:17:29,683
everything cheapish, is not a sign of a king.

1020
01:17:33,381 --> 01:17:38,175
I would buy one sari in the whole year but a good quality sari.

1021
01:17:38,295 --> 01:17:41,261
And I’ve got saris since My marriage, even before My marriage.

1022
01:17:41,381 --> 01:17:45,041
All those saris are with Me because I would buy only one sari

1023
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:50,282
of a good quality once a year, finished!

1024
01:17:50,402 --> 01:17:55,101
And traditional, not cheapish. But people will have twenty saris

1025
01:17:55,221 --> 01:17:57,111
and they didn’t know what to wear.

1026
01:17:57,231 --> 01:17:58,911
They’ll still walk out saying,

1027
01:17:59,031 --> 01:18:01,612
“I have a problema, I have no sari.”

1028
01:18:01,732 --> 01:18:05,396
Because all saris are very cheapish you have bought.

1029
01:18:05,516 --> 01:18:09,798
Same with men. Same with men. They try to save money,

1030
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:12,007
penny-wise pound foolishness.

1031
01:18:12,127 --> 01:18:16,376
And if you ask them. “Mother, You know what happened,

1032
01:18:16,496 --> 01:18:17,610
I have no clothes.”

1033
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:20,255
“All right you come without clothes, then what to do?”

1034
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:21,803
“No but there is this.”

1035
01:18:21,923 --> 01:18:24,813
“All right, then do one thing.”

1036
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:31,185
It is impossible to tell them that this is stupid.

1037
01:18:35,221 --> 01:18:40,678
You are the king, the way you talk to each other.

1038
01:18:40,798 --> 01:18:44,834
A king doesn’t talk too much, doesn’t.

1039
01:18:44,954 --> 01:18:48,871
If you are too talkative then remember you are not a king.

1040
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:54,867
The king doesn’t talk too much, very little, ‘yes’ or ‘no’.

1041
01:18:54,987 --> 01:18:58,590
Or whenever he has to talk, he talks sense.

1042
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:06,214
Also he is not glum. Another extreme are glum people.

1043
01:19:06,334 --> 01:19:09,561
You don’t know how you stand with them.

1044
01:19:10,188 --> 01:19:15,439
So one has to know that you are in charge of yourself as a king

1045
01:19:15,559 --> 01:19:19,658
or a queen and you carry yourself with that dignity.

1046
01:19:19,778 --> 01:19:24,092
You do not shout. You do not say things slowly,

1047
01:19:24,212 --> 01:19:27,325
as if you neck is chocked.

1048
01:19:27,445 --> 01:19:30,194
Some Sahaja yogis talk like that.

1049
01:19:30,314 --> 01:19:34,015
They think it’s very, they are kind to Me.

1050
01:19:34,642 --> 01:19:46,144
No, in freedom, but not shouting at Me and in a dignified manner.

1051
01:19:49,267 --> 01:19:53,374
Dignity is something cannot be taught.

1052
01:19:53,494 --> 01:19:56,410
It has to be inside yourself.

1053
01:19:58,799 --> 01:20:05,952
A person is not self conscious but is conscious of his dignity.

1054
01:20:08,812 --> 01:20:11,453
He doesn’t do cheap things, never.

1055
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:13,989
Never the cheap things, you know.

1056
01:20:15,068 --> 01:20:17,626
Once a gentleman met My husband.

1057
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:19,605
He said, “Why don’t you come and dance?”

1058
01:20:19,725 --> 01:20:22,345
He said, “No, I don’t dance because My wife doesn’t dance.”

1059
01:20:22,465 --> 01:20:24,751
He said, “Bring Her to England, She will start dancing.”

1060
01:20:24,871 --> 01:20:27,516
He said, “You take Her to Moon also She won’t do.”

1061
01:20:27,636 --> 01:20:28,908
That’s what My husband told.

1062
01:20:29,028 --> 01:20:32,935
“She’s not going to dance with this kind of a ball room dancing.

1063
01:20:33,055 --> 01:20:35,947
That She will not dance.”

1064
01:20:40,105 --> 01:20:43,971
It’s for the men and women to understand,

1065
01:20:44,883 --> 01:20:46,719
that is not dignified.

1066
01:20:46,839 --> 01:20:49,150
On this point you should decide,

1067
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:51,860
“If this is not dignified we are not going to do it.

1068
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:56,134
We are from the royal family of Shalivahanas

1069
01:20:58,101 --> 01:21:01,808
and we are not going to do anything that is undignified.”

1070
01:21:05,316 --> 01:21:10,889
All the ladies, all the men, all the Sahaja yoginis

1071
01:21:11,009 --> 01:21:14,784
and the Sahaja yogis are very different from all others.

1072
01:21:14,904 --> 01:21:17,950
And this is what we have to understand,

1073
01:21:18,608 --> 01:21:23,303
that how dignified we are for a Raja Lakshmi.

1074
01:21:23,423 --> 01:21:27,171
Then the Gruha Lakshmi I’ve already told you.

1075
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:29,971
And the Lakshmi tattwa I’ve already told you.

1076
01:21:30,091 --> 01:21:34,847
But there is another principle which is called alakshmi

1077
01:21:34,967 --> 01:21:41,648
and that alakshmi principle is where you may have everything,

1078
01:21:41,768 --> 01:21:46,018
but you are a beggar, alakshmi.

1079
01:21:51,422 --> 01:21:54,759
And that is what is to be avoided.

1080
01:21:56,219 --> 01:22:00,582
Alakshmi, without any Lakshmi principle.

1081
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:04,774
Then there is kulakshmi.

1082
01:22:04,894 --> 01:22:08,394
Kulakshmi is when you use your money for wrong things.

1083
01:22:08,965 --> 01:22:15,217
You use your money for drugs, for this, that, for bad business.

1084
01:22:16,185 --> 01:22:19,135
Whatever business you do you should know what you are doing,

1085
01:22:19,255 --> 01:22:24,019
is for what. Kulakshmi.

1086
01:22:25,939 --> 01:22:28,772
Grabbing the money of Sahaja yogis or Sahaja Yoga

1087
01:22:28,892 --> 01:22:33,752
is the worst type of a Lakshmi, it’s very, very serious.

1088
01:22:35,895 --> 01:22:39,324
So that’s how you come down.

1089
01:22:39,444 --> 01:22:44,152
And, now when you see the whole world is, how it is,

1090
01:22:44,272 --> 01:22:47,417
when you have to pull it out, you have to have more strength,

1091
01:22:47,537 --> 01:22:51,866
more strength to pull them out, strength of love.

1092
01:22:51,986 --> 01:22:57,094
Again we come to the same point: strength of love.

1093
01:22:59,943 --> 01:23:02,565
That’s the strength keeps Me laughing all the time,

1094
01:23:02,685 --> 01:23:05,200
enjoying Myself.

1095
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:17,200
Even a least [part] of this joy I cannot give up.

1096
01:23:19,913 --> 01:23:22,192
In the same way I bless you

1097
01:23:22,312 --> 01:23:25,330
with all the Lakshmi principle and Mahalakshmi principle

1098
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:28,761
but above all the principle of love,

1099
01:23:28,881 --> 01:23:33,473
the pure love without any expectations, nirvajya.

1100
01:23:33,593 --> 01:23:36,708
I bless you all on this auspicious day.

1101
01:23:36,828 --> 01:23:39,900
May God bless you!Have wisdom

1102
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:42,682
and understand that Mother has said it out of Her heart,

1103
01:23:42,802 --> 01:23:47,436
out of Her love, out of Her feelings for us.

1104
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:48,756
May God bless you!
