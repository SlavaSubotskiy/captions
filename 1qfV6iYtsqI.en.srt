00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,779
Shri Ganesha Puja, Cabella,
15th September, 1991

3
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:29,980
Today is the happiest day for all of you,
for the whole universe, because Shri Ganesha

4
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,720
was created.

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:45,300
He was created to emit auspiciousness through
His Chaitanya [- Divine Vibrations –ed.].

6
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:54,569
First, the whole cosmos was filled with this
Chaitanyasrishti [- creation of Divine Vibrations

7
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:55,569
–ed.].

8
00:00:55,569 --> 00:01:04,229
Then Brahmadeva came into play, and He created
all the matter.

9
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:21,160
But 

10
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:42,360
the greatest blessings of the Divine Power
was to symbolize Chaitanya, and this Chaitanya

11
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:51,980
has many aspects, but specially in Shri Ganesha,
it is auspiciousness.

12
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:58,870
In these modern times people have lost the
sense of auspiciousness.

13
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:06,390
Everything that emits vibrations, Chaitanya,
is auspicious, is shubh, and whatever does

14
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:13,060
not is not by any chance auspicious.

15
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:22,680
So first of all, whatever you worship, whatever
you accept, all of them have to be auspicious

16
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,500
things.

17
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:33,879
Every shape has a coefficience and all these
shapes which you see, not necessarily give

18
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,769
vibrations.

19
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:43,730
But in the human beings also, we find there
are many people, like you, who have Chaitanya

20
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,599
flowing in them.

21
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:53,049
But this Chaitanya when it flows, we just
take Shri Ganesha for granted.

22
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:58,310
We do not understand that we have to awaken
Shri Ganesha within us.

23
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,310
Means what?

24
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,400
What we have to do?

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:10,360
There is Shri Ganesha already existing in
you and as I said that innocence cannot be

26
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:18,180
lost, so Shri Ganesha is eternal being, eternal
child – He cannot be lost and He cannot

27
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,840
be destroyed.

28
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,069
So He’s all the time there.

29
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:36,109
Maybe some clouds of your ill doings are covering
the great personality of innocence.

30
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:42,019
But it is always there present.

31
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:50,319
So now, what should we do to keep this Ganesha
all the time shining within us?

32
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:59,579
Is to first remember that you were made in
the same pattern as Shri Ganesh.

33
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:09,120
But His Kundalini is on His stomach; His pure
desire is on His stomach.

34
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:21,650
It’s very significant to understand why
it is there that His Kundalini is on His stomach.

35
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:33,830
That means He does not have to conquer the
temptations of Mooladhara at all.

36
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:43,060
But He has His Kundalini on His stomach, that
means He is also beyond the temptations of

37
00:04:43,060 --> 00:05:01,960
food, of power or anything because His stomach
represents absolute abandonment, absolute

38
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,140
freedom.

39
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:10,460
He’s not bothered as to how He looks that…
these days there is a big fashion that you

40
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,580
cannot have a big belly.

41
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:19,970
I mean this is becoming a big… not only
fashion but a big business.

42
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,100
But as age grows, you have to have it.

43
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:30,230
Even small children have that and they look
so sweet.

44
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:38,090
Those people who are very thin must understand
that they might be getting some prizes in

45
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:53,220
the… maybe beauty contest or something,
but they do not have that majesty, that royalty,

46
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,900
that dignity in them as they should have.

47
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,500
So Shri Ganesha accepts everything.

48
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:08,270
He has a head with a trunk.

49
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,840
He accepts it.

50
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,110
Of course, is important, He should have that.

51
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:20,060
Because head of the elephant suggests that
He is not like a human being who develops

52
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:29,890
ego, superego, conditionings, but He is just
all the time one with the Divine.

53
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:36,330
He accepts His body, He accepts His head,
He accepts His ears, He accepts everything

54
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,400
that He is made of.

55
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:47,770
He doesn’t aspire to something – some
entrepreneurs put some ideas and He wouldn’t

56
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,710
go run after them.

57
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:58,470
He won’t try to change Himself; He won’t
try to create that fashion and all that.

58
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:11,270
He is what He is… because He is a satisfied
soul.

59
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:24,870
The Kundalini on the stomach shows a complete,
self-contented, satisfied personality of Shri

60
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,840
Ganesha.

61
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:37,450
When you have all the powers within you, you
know you are powerful, then you don’t hanker

62
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:47,640
after all these things and you don’t try
to make a position or an impression of others.

63
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:56,790
For example, He would never go and read books
like how to impress people.

64
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:02,510
Very common.

65
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:11,090
So now, as you are created in the same image
of Shri Ganesh, you have to understand that

66
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:19,350
you have to accept whatever God has given
you, whatever position He has given you.

67
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,840
Same with Christ.

68
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,080
Christ accepted His father who was just a
carpenter.

69
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,620
He didn’t aspire for something higher or
some sort of a special position or a power

70
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:43,110
because He was so powerful – what more power
can He have?

71
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:50,160
Though people mocked at Him and laughed at
Him and could not accept what He was saying,

72
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,570
but still He was self-contented, self-satisfied.

73
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,690
He knew what it was.

74
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:10,240
So, for a Sahaja Yogi first thing is to be
self-contented.

75
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:20,870
As I told you, the fundamentals of the western
life is to see and to be seen.

76
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:31,880
Both things were missing completely in the
incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

77
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,320
So when I say these things, suddenly people
start thinking, “Let us become hippies,

78
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,550
or let them become punks, or let us become
this, let us become that.”

79
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,490
You don’t have to become anything.

80
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:51,700
Whatever you have – your body, your face,
your hair – everything is there, just meant

81
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,930
for you.

82
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:11,560
You don’t have to change anything outwardly
because inside is complete Chaitanya.

83
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,700
Shri Ganesha never tried to change Himself.

84
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:32,810
Though there were so many clouds on His being,
though many people insulted Him, tortured

85
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:42,790
Him, hanged Him, crucified Him, still the
Eternal Being didn’t bother.

86
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:56,290
So the first and foremost thing for a Sahaja
Yogi is to accept, go on accepting things.

87
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:01,470
But when I say accept, I must say the other
side also: that doesn’t mean you start accepting

88
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,150
bhoots, all the bad qualities of others.

89
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:12,330
“Mother, You said you must accept”, so
they’ll start accepting all these bad qualities.

90
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,650
“What’s wrong?

91
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,380
You have said it already.”

92
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,800
Whatever I say has another side, always.

93
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,000
Like I said, “Now you have become your own
Guru.”

94
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,740
So, “Why should we listen to anybody else?”

95
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:45,400
Like this, you see, we go on diverting ourselves,
deviating ourselves from reality just to cheat

96
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,560
ourselves.

97
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,730
And this comes because we have no wisdom.

98
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:59,110
We have no wisdom because we do not know what
is for our benevolence, what is for our good,

99
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,680
what we should do for our good.

100
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,610
I mean even if we know, we don’t want to
do it.

101
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,900
So, what we lack is wisdom.

102
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,329
That’s a vicious circle, I must say, that
Ganesha is to be awakened to give you wisdom

103
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:23,860
– He is the giver of wisdom, He is the giver
of wisdom – and He has to give you the wisdom,

104
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:29,010
He is to be awakened; but you are not wise
because He is not awakened.

105
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:34,779
It’s a very vicious circle.

106
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:38,320
How to make this vicious circle break?

107
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,750
That “Let my wisdom shine in my attention.

108
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:53,640
Let Shri Ganesha throw His light in my attention.”

109
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,380
Mentally you people are very alert, no doubt.

110
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:08,970
And you can always cheat yourself nicely.

111
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:20,810
That’s the point where you could see yourself
– introspection, which I have seen among

112
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,110
Russians.

113
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,420
Just introspect: “Why do I do like that?

114
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,529
Why cannot I meditate?

115
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:38,330
Am I going to miss out?

116
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:46,750
Why can I not do something that is good for
me?”

117
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:56,890
Introspection is the only way you can see
yourself how far you are from Shri Ganesh.

118
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:08,750
Even, I have seen, when I say something in
general, people always – the mind is very

119
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:14,330
clever – thinks that I am talking about
somebody else, not about them.

120
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:23,050
It’s a convex mind, convex, which never
receives anything inside itself because there

121
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:28,450
is no wisdom.

122
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:39,000
If you are wise, then not only that you’ll
accept but you’ll understand and it will

123
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,840
penetrate into your attention through your
central nervous system.

124
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,480
You just know that this is it.

125
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:56,301
Now you know that this… you put your hand
towards this candle, it… you’ll… your

126
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:57,430
fingers might burn.

127
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:03,390
You know it definitely, with experience, and
you won’t do that.

128
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:11,800
With experience you have learnt not to put
your hand on to the candle.

129
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,470
And this wisdom is there, I don’t have to
tell you that.

130
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,370
But this is a new life you have started – a
spiritual life.

131
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:30,170
When you are going into the spiritual life,
try to remember your experiences, one after

132
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:35,730
another: how you got transformed, how you
changed, how many the bad things that you

133
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,750
had disappeared gradually and how you have
become so nice.

134
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:49,470
This will take away your depression – to
begin with.

135
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,880
Then you should think that, “What do I have
to do further?

136
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,140
Am I really wise, or I’m stupid?”

137
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:05,290
There are lots of stages between absolute
stupidity and absolute wisdom, and you see

138
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:15,930
all those shades all over, and combinations
and permutations of these I see every day.

139
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:27,520
And I am surprised that after getting your
Self Realization, when Shri Ganesha is shining

140
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:35,760
in your attention, you should see your reflection
clearly and try to correct it.

141
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:44,760
Only this much wisdom if you have that, “I
have to work out my benevolence”, you’ll

142
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,839
do it.

143
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,029
I know of somebody who would never get up
in the mornings, say for example.

144
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:59,470
But one day I saw him ready at about six o’clock
in the morning – I was surprised.

145
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,949
How this gentleman who has no self-discipline
has suddenly got up at six o’clock and ready

146
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:06,650
to go somewhere.

147
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,780
I said, “Where are you going?”

148
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,180
“You don’t know?”

149
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,180
I said, “What?”

150
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:21,089
“I have got a job now and I have to be present
at 8 o’clock and it will take two hours

151
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,290
to reach that place.

152
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,309
Also, I am keeping some margin.

153
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,850
So I have to leave now.

154
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,000
I can’t talk to You even.”

155
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,610
Quite alert, awake.

156
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:42,240
Now, what is the thing is as far as money
is concerned, lot of wisdom is there.

157
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:50,090
Don’t have to tell them, that is automatically.

158
00:17:50,090 --> 00:18:01,220
Money wisdom is quite a lot, job wisdom is
quite a lot.

159
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:13,390
Because these things means prestige in the
society, this means security in the society.

160
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:19,770
So this kind of business you find in many
people and in some even that is missing.

161
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:25,190
They don’t even understand that they have
to earn their living.

162
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:35,110
But that’s the minimum, you cannot be parasite.

163
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:41,350
Then the second stage, as I said by many stages,
is this: that we are not for money, money

164
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:50,990
is for us.

165
00:18:50,990 --> 00:19:03,770
The attention if it is on your Spirit, on
the Ganesha Principle, then whole situation

166
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,580
will change.

167
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:12,200
Your priorities will change.

168
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,430
And suddenly people will say, “Mother, what
has happened to this gentleman?

169
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:27,980
He was a stupid fool, now he has become such
a wise person.”

170
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,980
So to awaken Shri Ganesha you should have
minimum wisdom already there.

171
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,510
I mean, even if that is not there, how can
you work it out?

172
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:46,460
Is not meant for stupid people, Moodhas, not
meant for Moodh.

173
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,430
So now what is our benevolence is?

174
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:54,430
Let us see.

175
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,260
Is it money?

176
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,850
No.

177
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:05,730
Those who have money don’t seem to be very
happy people always.

178
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,400
Then what is the next, is jobs?

179
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,730
Those who have jobs – all right, should
have jobs, I am not saying you should be jobless.

180
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:20,270
I mean immediately the another side they will
take, I mean so quick you know, that, “Mother

181
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:28,260
is saying we can be jobless you see, nice.”

182
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,040
Immediate, escapes.

183
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:37,900
Now, then the power: you want to have political
power, this social power, this power, that

184
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:44,720
power – is absolutely a joyless pursuit.

185
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:52,710
You go and see those people who are supposed
to be powerful, so called, half way they are

186
00:20:52,710 --> 00:21:03,299
towards hell, one foot there and one foot
here and about to be gulped down by the crocodiles.

187
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:09,419
You can see it clearly.

188
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:15,549
Specially in this Kali Yuga it’s so obvious,
so clear-cut.

189
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:23,750
We don’t want to be like them, we want to
be like Shri Ganesh.

190
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:29,770
So once you start accepting your circumstances,
accepting your body, your… accepting your

191
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:47,929
face, everything, you will see that lot of
time will be saved.

192
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:58,270
Another problem that faces us is planning.

193
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,690
And that is missing in Shri Ganesha completely.

194
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,300
He did not do any planning whatsoever.

195
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:11,500
I wish He had done some planning, things would
have been much better.

196
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:18,250
He doesn’t believe in planning because He
is so powerful.

197
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,710
Whatever He wants, He can get it done.

198
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,710
You want the sun?

199
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,790
All right the sun is there.

200
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,790
You want the moon?

201
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,790
Moon is there.

202
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,790
You want the stars?

203
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,790
Stars is there.

204
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:41,280
The 
dust of His feet can create the whole universe

205
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,970
– universes after universes.

206
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:58,970
For such a person, there is no need to be
planning everything because whatever He wants

207
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,980
happens.

208
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,030
But why, why it happens?

209
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,740
Why He has this power?

210
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,059
Because He is in that state.

211
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:22,570
Are you in that state?

212
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,540
You have not achieved that state.

213
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:36,250
You talk somebody… tell somebody that, “Oh
my, I have to go and catch the plane.”

214
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:41,650
There are ten people standing next to you,
they’ll all get panicky.

215
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:48,799
I have to go, and they are bothered; something
sort of goes off their heads.

216
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,679
I don’t know what goes, they go amuck.

217
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,130
I never tell them like that.

218
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:59,560
I say, “There’s still time for the plane
to go, and don’t worry.

219
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:08,410
When I reach there then the plane will leave
so you don’t worry.”

220
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:21,720
But because of this kind of a… presumptions,
and the planning system of the mind, you just

221
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,720
think that, “Now I have a plan to go today,
I must go.”

222
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
Why?

223
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,010
I won’t go.

224
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,600
I may decide at the last minute I don’t
want to go.

225
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,050
I’ll make the plane go away.

226
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:40,100
We did that many a times, you know very well.

227
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:47,910
I wanted to buy the Rome Ashram, so I saw
to it that the plane never arrived.

228
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:52,910
But you have to be in that state.

229
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,140
Specially buying this Cabella, you know what
happened.

230
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:04,210
There were five great intellectuals on My
head sitting.

231
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:09,100
I didn’t know how I will manage these five
intellectuals with all their planning, this,

232
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:18,480
that; they made Me run up and down, do this
and that, Ultimately they all had to come

233
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,490
here.

234
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,530
But I was telling them, “Go and have a look.”

235
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:34,030
Nobody would look at it, nobody would listen
to Me, nobody wanted to know about it.

236
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:47,030
How things work out – is your pure desire
that can work out anything that you want.

237
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,950
But you won’t want funny things also.

238
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,940
Like Shri Ganesha would not like to follow
some entrepreneur who is saying, “Have a

239
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,669
punk on your head”, or something.

240
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:04,100
Is stupidity, all kinds of stupidities.

241
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,250
Because you are stupid, these entrepreneurs
are having a good time; they can befool us

242
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,840
all the time.

243
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:25,180
At His state, He is Himself, on top of the
pure desire.

244
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:31,140
The pure desire is on His stomach, tied up
nicely.

245
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:48,530
It is to be seen in Sahaja Yoga how things
work out, how miraculously they work out,

246
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,950
and these can happen to you also.

247
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:57,580
All these Powers can come to you also.

248
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:02,840
You know about some people who came to us
who didn’t know even how to sing.

249
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,160
I mean, they had no voices; something very
funny they had – I mean I didn’t know

250
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,789
from where they learnt to even talk.

251
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:18,400
When they opened their mouths, if you were
at one note, they were on another note and

252
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,970
they went on and on and on without even listening
to what they were singing.

253
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:32,040
After some time, I find they are singing beautifully.

254
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,840
So the Kundalini itself is working it out,
the pure desire is working it out, but what

255
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,370
about you?

256
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:44,690
What are you doing about it is to be seen.

257
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:58,230
There are so many things that could be understood
very easily through the lifestyle of Shri

258
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,240
Ganesha.

259
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:13,799
The first and foremost thing for Him is to
obey His Mother – never to say no, no question,

260
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:22,970
and also not to ask why.

261
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:31,120
He will go and fight with all the Gods and
Goddesses and every one.

262
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:38,250
And that’s what Christ has said, “Anything
against Me I’ve tolerated but nothing against

263
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,909
the Holy Ghost.”

264
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:57,600
There should be no question, there should
be no explanation.

265
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:06,980
Sometimes even My patience goes out, the way
they do not want to accept what I am telling

266
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,980
them.

267
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,030
At the end of course they all come around,
no doubt – at the end.

268
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:16,390
But you waste so much time convincing them.

269
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:19,650
What is the reason?

270
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,430
They have no wisdom to know what their Mother
is.

271
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:32,650
Like, you know the story of Shri Ganesha that
His Mother said, “The one who goes round

272
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:38,539
the Mother Earth, I will give you a present.”

273
00:29:38,539 --> 00:29:49,659
So, Ganesha again accepts a little mouse as
a transport – imagine.

274
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:56,130
Nowadays people can’t believe it that Shri
Ganesha, so powerful, should accept just a

275
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,600
mouse for His transport.

276
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:10,350
Because He’s so humble; he doesn’t have
to show off His Lincoln or Mercedes to anyone;

277
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:16,610
He is very comfortable with His mouse.

278
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,900
Now what does He do?

279
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,890
He thinks that…

280
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:29,790
He understands, in no time, that His Mother
is much greater than the Mother Earth.

281
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,309
“So why should I go round the Mother Earth?”

282
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:41,750
His brother is going round on a peacock.

283
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:46,960
He just goes round His Mother – He gets
the present.

284
00:30:46,960 --> 00:31:01,520
It’s such a simple thing to understand because
He is the wisest person.

285
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:18,170
The wisest person knows what is what, he knows
who is who, he knows what are the qualities

286
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,280
of these persons.

287
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:31,210
He is not impressed by superficial things,
no.

288
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:39,340
If somebody is well dressed, then people get
very much impressed by them, and they turn

289
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:52,580
out to be bank robbers – walking with umbrellas
and with lined suits, as if some big executives

290
00:31:52,580 --> 00:32:02,970
are coming, and they decamp with all the loot.

291
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:15,380
So for a wise person, the superficial behavior
doesn’t appeal, not bothered.

292
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:31,029
It is a kind of a very penetrating intelligence;
just like a computer you know.

293
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:33,370
In a second you know that what is this gentleman.

294
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:40,549
Oh, he may come with a great, you see, ado
and he might come and praise you and do this

295
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:50,110
and do that and you know the person very well.

296
00:32:50,110 --> 00:33:00,940
If some body is unduly very friendly, very
kind, very nice, not necessarily that he is

297
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:11,549
really appreciating you but he is looking
at your purse, maybe, maybe something else.

298
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:21,059
But not only on this level, it is even on
a spiritual level we have to understand how

299
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:33,090
people try to put you down spiritually; what
they try, what tricks they try on you.

300
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:41,130
It could be your husband, your wife, your
children, your relations, your friends, anybody,

301
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,200
any Sahaja Yogi.

302
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,220
But in the case of Shri Ganesha, it’s the
other way round.

303
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:52,620
They say that if you put one apple, bad apple,
all the apples get spoilt.

304
00:33:52,620 --> 00:34:03,900
But if you put Shri Ganesha among all the
bad apples, they’ll get all right.

305
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,880
Because He’s the life-giving force.

306
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:24,870
This is one of the greatest qualities, that
He knows that He is the source of life and

307
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:28,270
He gives life, He gives Chaitanya.

308
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:36,550
He doesn’t say… think that, “Now supposing
I give Chaitanya, give life to this person,

309
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,960
my ego will come up,” – very common problem.

310
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:47,050
“Mother I don’t want to do it because
my ego will come up.”

311
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,119
Everybody is psychoanalyzing themselves ‘because
this will happen’ – Baba!

312
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,000
[- Hindi expression of a general exclamatory
nature –ed.]

313
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,710
You are all realized souls now, you are all
saints.

314
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:03,910
The false people are talking so big, and you
the people who have got something are still

315
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:07,250
thinking, “My ego will come up, this will
happen.”

316
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:13,130
No, no, you have the powers.

317
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:23,950
But as you keep it under a manger, as Christ
has said, the light will go out.

318
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:35,869
You have to give it to others, you have to
open it out.

319
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:37,950
And that is how you will judge your state.

320
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,600
“What is my state?

321
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,670
Let’s see.

322
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,760
Where am I?”

323
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:53,250
That confidence, take it from Me, should be
with you.

324
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:58,790
All of you have to work out this way.

325
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,770
Very many…

326
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,040
“Mother, my Mooladhara is caught up.”

327
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,920
How dare anybody catch Mooladhar?

328
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,970
That’s the anger of Shri Ganesha.

329
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:14,260
How dare?

330
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,869
How can anybody?

331
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:26,670
What’s missing is complete faith in yourself
and faith in your Mother.

332
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:34,650
In Russia recently… in Prague, there was
a lady who was brought on the stage, very

333
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,850
old lady, couldn’t walk.

334
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:42,119
I mean they just carried her and she came
and sat before Me on a chair.

335
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,380
She said, “I know You…

336
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,730
I’ll be cured.

337
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,640
I am in Your presence; I know I will be cured.”

338
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,760
I said, “Then get up.”

339
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,990
She got up.

340
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:56,530
Those who were with Me in Prague, you can
ask them.

341
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:02,869
She came down and she started running, and
everybody laughed.

342
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:15,550
But her faith – she was not a Sahaja Yogini
as such – but she was sure; she knew Me.

343
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:19,660
And she just started running like that and
everybody started looking at her.

344
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:28,360
Same thing happened in Russia for many people
– very serious diseases.

345
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:37,359
So that, one thing is for sure, either you
don’t know that you are realized souls or

346
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,630
else you don’t know Me, one of the two things.

347
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,640
Why was He so obedient to His Mother?

348
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,310
Why was He?

349
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,090
Because that was the wisest thing to do.

350
00:37:48,090 --> 00:38:00,310
The one who knows everything, it’s better
to be guided by that person.

351
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:04,690
And many a times I have seen, people try to
do things without telling Me, important things

352
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:07,559
– they fall into traps.

353
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:14,800
Then they come back to Me and I tell them
the solution, it works.

354
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,360
It’s not necessary that you should tell
Me everything.

355
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:31,440
But when you are in a fix, you can always
just go into yourself and ask yourself, “What

356
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,470
would Mother do?”

357
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,410
You’ll get the answer.

358
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,760
You are at a… quite a higher state.

359
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,180
But still, even if you are on a tree and you
are still thinking you are falling down, you

360
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,430
are nowhere.

361
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,680
Steady yourself.

362
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:57,520
That’s what is, we say, the Adhishthan of
Shri Ganesha.

363
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:06,230
Is the steadiness, steadiness in your achievements
of Sahaj Yog.

364
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:14,070
Believing in yourself that you have entered
into the new world, into the new atmosphere

365
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:17,880
[UNCLEAR] it out.

366
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:25,060
Shri Ganesha is just waiting.

367
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,950
But He is not meant for people who have no
courage.

368
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:45,933
Such a courageous man who could go and fight
with all the Devas, because He knew the Shakti

369
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:52,540
was with Him.

370
00:39:52,540 --> 00:40:01,900
Today is such a joyous day for Me because
we have children, and we are dealing with

371
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,900
children.

372
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,900
Most of them are born realized.

373
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:15,900
They are of a very special category, I have
told you many a times, but we spoil them;

374
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:24,010
because we were not born realized, so we don’t
know how to handle these children, we spoil

375
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,010
them.

376
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:30,540
Not only we spoil them, but we interfere with
the school, we interfere with this as if we

377
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:40,660
are the wisest parents ever living.

378
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:47,170
Because we are Sahaja Yogis, we have to be
much more sensible than other parents.

379
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,680
How can you interfere with any school anywhere?

380
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:58,700
But in Sahaja Yoga you will.

381
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:08,930
It is because there is no wisdom and no understanding
what is good and benevolent for your child.

382
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:13,900
If you love your child, then you must think
of its benevolent.

383
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:20,790
You must learn from the experience what happens
to children if they are left like that.

384
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:27,940
You cannot spoil your child, you cannot because
it’s a special category of children they

385
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,940
are.

386
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:40,280
They are not children who can become vagabonds;
they cannot become thieves.

387
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:47,970
So you will make them something funny – they
are neither here nor there.

388
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:56,570
They are born realized and they have to be
channelized properly, to achieve their complete

389
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:04,400
manifestation of their Spirit.

390
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:14,579
So the possessiveness and the stupid attachments
to children must be given up.

391
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:20,410
There is no force on you – if you want to
destroy a child, you can destroy.

392
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:27,060
But in an advice – if you were Ganeshas,
you would have understood it, I don’t have

393
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:31,250
to explain so much.

394
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:38,910
What is good for your child, because we have
to have beautiful children.

395
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:41,200
They are born beautiful children, I tell you.

396
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,930
If they are spoilt, it is because of you,
you have spoilt them.

397
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,350
You have ruined them.

398
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,910
You are responsible.

399
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:58,810
I know of so many children – they’re very,
very sweet.

400
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:06,510
I have conference with them also and I find
them much more congenial; I have much better

401
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:11,670
rapport with them than I can have with you.

402
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,750
They never argue, never.

403
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:25,599
They never says no, and they have very good
information about all of you.

404
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:32,540
So it is such a nice thing that today you
should desire that our children should very

405
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:43,390
soon become the images of Shri Ganesha, His
Ganas, who have to work out so much.

406
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:46,670
It’s a tremendous task.

407
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:54,650
Sahaja Yoga is the greatest achievement of
Spiritual evolution.

408
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:59,250
We all have to dedicate ourselves.

409
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:05,220
We don’t have to sacrifice anything as the
Saints have sacrificed – nothing, don’t

410
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,800
have to suffer anything.

411
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,700
Only thing you have to have – wisdom.

412
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:16,119
For that, I am very happy that today we are
worshipping Shri Ganesha.

413
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:24,820
So the pure desire should be that, “Shri
Ganesha please give us Divine Wisdom.”

414
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,800
That’s all.

415
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,270
It contains everything in it.

416
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,270
May God bless you.

417
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,270
Today’s Puja is going to be quite short
and the children have to come up today, first

418
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,270
of all – all the children.

419
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:31,273
End of transcript.
