00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,533
Talk to Yogis in Rahuri, (India) 7 January 1983.

2
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:10,555
You have come here to learn

3
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:14,708
something, to go deep into your experiences

4
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:21,557
of the knowledge of your roots.

5
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:26,766
Shri Krishna has said that this is

6
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:30,509
a tree which is upside down, the

7
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:34,497
roots are upwards and the

8
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:37,456
leaves are outwards.

9
00:09:37,456 --> 00:09:40,206
In the same way, you

10
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:43,665
know that Kundalini really, when

11
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:47,391
it rises in the Sahasrara or above

12
00:09:47,391 --> 00:09:50,656
Sahasrara, then you start getting the

13
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:56,049
feeling of Kundalini. So, one has to

14
00:09:56,049 --> 00:10:00,043
understand that when we are now getting

15
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:03,097
subtler and subtler and trying to

16
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:05,659
feel the Kundalini, we should try to

17
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:10,864
get out of materialistic attitude and

18
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:13,929
materialistic viewpoint and materialistic

19
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:18,118
sticking point. I had met one

20
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,587
guru before, because you know I went

21
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,391
to all of them. And I asked one of

22
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:26,325
them, I said, why do you take money,

23
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,334
so much money from these people who

24
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:32,390
are western people? So much, why do you

25
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,552
take and just they become beggars,
absolutely, like beggars they become

26
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,587
because you charge them so much and

27
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:43,380
so heavily??And he told me that unless

28
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,608
and until you make them beggars

29
00:10:45,608 --> 00:10:48,137
they will never take to God. They are

30
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:51,228
too rich to be near God. I mean,

31
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:54,787
this explanation I just could not

32
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:58,047
understand, it was absurd, I could not

33
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:03,789
understand how can this explanation
have any proper meaning that you should

34
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,781
make people beggars and
then they be nearer to God.

35
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:09,098
I said, in India we have
many beggars, do you think

36
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:12,978
those beggars are nearer to God??So he

37
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:15,228
said, 揘o, otherwise, you see, they get

38
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:17,611
stuck up with their money and you

39
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,948
must just make them absolutely without

40
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:24,220
any money, moneyless people.

41
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:32,013
So, I mean, of course to such a
stupid person what can you talk?

42
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:33,643
What can you convince?

43
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:39,239
I couldn't say to him, then
why are you taking the money?

44
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:44,304
Then he would have said,
because I am detached.?

45
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:50,896
You see, anything one can say like that if you
start like that you cannot just stop it.

46
00:11:50,896 --> 00:11:56,838
But one has to understand that
materialism has gone into our roots

47
00:11:56,838 --> 00:12:02,370
and if we have to clear out our roots
we must get out of materialism.

48
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,209
That's important, but that does not
in any way mean that you torture your

49
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:08,420
body or anything, I dont mean that.

50
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,270
But what Iam saying, your attention.

51
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:16,263
[Shri Mataji addresses some
children] you shouldn't do like that.

52
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:20,219
Always Natali you get up which you know is not
good.Always disturb is not good.Sit Down.

53
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:22,671
Now even if there are so many
childrens sitting down here.

54
00:12:22,671 --> 00:12:25,805
Please sit down and dont
disturb any more sit down.

55
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:29,072
Sonu come and sit here. Sonu come here.Better....
and then she gets the diarrhea always.

56
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:49,886
You are not here just to enjoy but you are here for a
puja do you understand that. You are grown up girl now.

57
00:12:49,912 --> 00:13:28,002
Look at all these children's how they are sitting quitely.Will they move out? they don't understand English.I have seen all our English children whether it is in Caxton hall or whether it is any hall all of them must go out and
make a big noise and play there. It's always seen they cannot sit down. Look at them these children how quitely they are sitting. What a quality it is! They are just feeling the vibrations and they are enjoying it. They dont want

58
00:13:28,028 --> 00:14:44,509
to go out.There is no enjoyment outside. Its inside. See them. See the contrast.You must keep eyes open to see. See our children. Now Linda is there she will tell you. She has to manage the children outside the caxton hall.They are shouting,screaming and the caxton hall people will always tell me that its better not have childrens for your program because they make suchh a lot of noise. Its very common problem. They have atleast told me 10 times that please
don't allow children to come in. But the children will never sit quitely even for 5 minutes. As soon as 5 min. will start they will say lets go out.. They can't sit quitely. Poor Sonu whenever she goes out she gets a diarrhea. .....All right Orea you sit somewhere out from there separately. You also.You have only here 3 childrens and you will always see them walking about. and another is Mathews where is he? I have to keep eye on them. It's dangerous.

59
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:50,430
So now, when we are
dealing with our

60
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:55,843
roots we have to be in the center,

61
00:14:55,843 --> 00:15:00,757
in the core. In the core mean we are

62
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:05,759
taking in, sucking in the feeling

63
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,009
or you can say the?

64
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:15,564
Feeling and awareness put together, what do you
say to that in English, is there any word?

65
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:19,829
Is there any word which makes
awareness and feeling put together?

66
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:25,090
Is there Gavin?

67
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,412
[answer: Experience]

68
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:30,929
Oh, yeah, experience, you can say the

69
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,682
experience into your awareness and feeling.

70
00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:39,410
You have to get the experience
into your awareness and feeling.

71
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,111
In Marathi it is a very simple word Jaaniiv

72
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:45,388
comes from the word ja.

73
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:50,848
Ja comes the word spontaneous.

74
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:53,501
Also ja has two meaning.

75
00:15:53,501 --> 00:16:02,167
Ja means also dnyana, awareness, and
also it means spontaneous zaaniiv.

76
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:12,531
So you start sucking that within yourself, when
you are not entangled into other things.

77
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:17,431
If your attention is entangled
outside, you cannot enjoy.

78
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:21,720
So, to be lost into which is
samaadhi you see, is the one where

79
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,295
your attention is completely
drowned into the experience.

80
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:29,921
That iswhat we have to achieve.

81
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:34,710
So it is  not only materialism, also emotionalism,all kinds of isms.?

82
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,052
We are attacked by all kind of isms?

83
00:16:38,052 --> 00:16:45,175
since the history of word started in this
world I think and now the unholy thing that

84
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:50,927
the ism? latest is, could be sahaja
Yoga-ism?

85
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:57,605
also could be the greatest word because now
there has to be attack on Sahaja Yoga also.

86
00:16:57,605 --> 00:17:06,897
In this one is that as I told you, I didnt explain
it properly or you didnt hear Me properly that day,

87
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:20,306
that Sahaja Yoga does not mean lethargy or
slowness, not at all, but is a quick and a fast

88
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:24,941
stepping in into the dissolution.

89
00:17:24,941 --> 00:17:28,003
Very quick!

90
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:31,898
And once you very quickly

91
00:17:31,898 --> 00:17:34,848
dissolve into it, the whole movement

92
00:17:34,848 --> 00:17:36,690
of your body is quick but not jerky,

93
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:44,540
is smooth and quick, rhythmic, is musical,

94
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,706
neither is awkward nor lethargic,

95
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:50,782
but is musical, is as a rhythm about

96
00:17:50,782 --> 00:17:54,745
it, is very gracious.

97
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:59,335
The whole movement of dissolution can happen

98
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:04,580
to you very easily if you dont allow

99
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:11,907
your attention to be attacked by all these isms.?

100
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:13,436
There is no end to it,

101
00:18:13,436 --> 00:18:17,686
I mean, if I have to write all of them I
think we will have to need at least one book

102
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:23,771
to write all the ism's of the world, there
is no end to it, which we have created.

103
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:28,078
Then the worst of all is now
I think Sahaja Yoga-ism

104
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:35,325
in which first of all is
the feeling of lethargy:

105
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:40,508
it will happen Sahaja, sit down.
Mother will do everything for you.

106
00:18:40,508 --> 00:18:43,727
The another is Sahaja Yoga-egoism

107
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:47,497
in which we haven't got one fellow lying there,

108
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:55,651
in which people sahajayogi's get into tantrums, try
to show off that they are great Sahajayogi's

109
00:18:55,651 --> 00:19:01,579
they have reached the third stage
or the seventh stage or whatever they may.

110
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:07,327
Now it's good this example is a very
good example, I wish you had taken up.

111
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:13,768
But see the expression of the Indian,

112
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:16,252
the enamored expression, see, it

113
00:19:16,252 --> 00:19:20,222
so genuine, they can't control the singing.

114
00:19:20,222 --> 00:19:27,581
Now, see, it's like a ?I just dont know, but people
think it's a package deal sort of a thing.

115
00:19:27,581 --> 00:19:31,007
It's so nonsensical I tell you, that either

116
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:33,167
they could be taken out all their money

117
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:38,524
or if they are to be told now for Puja,
all of them are paying twenty-one

118
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:44,060
because they have to do this or this extra work, so
they are charging twenty-one

119
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,874
and if you tell them for Puja they
will even give them fifty-one.

120
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:56,076
But I have told some of you have even refused
that I mean it's so shameful I tell you!

121
00:19:56,076 --> 00:20:00,748
It's absolutely shameful! Can you imagine?

122
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:02,909
What is twenty-one rupees to you?

123
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:10,555
To them it's quite a lot, because it's some sort of
part of you you are giving which is so nonsensical,

124
00:20:10,555 --> 00:20:19,491
is a feeling , is a sign of complete negativity. Left Nabhi.

125
00:20:19,491 --> 00:20:23,095
It's a problem. Materialism
it's complete materialism.

126
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:31,192
Those who have been, say, doing
vegetarianism are materialists in India,

127
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:39,964
we have seen the cases like you see the Jains
and the Marvari and the Gujaratis.

128
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:45,818
They are all vegetarians, supposed to be compassionate people,

129
00:20:45,818 --> 00:20:51,466
they build some temples also and sometimes
they give to poor people also and

130
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:55,455
sometimes to people like Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna
who are begging in India.

131
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:59,790
They give money to them. Supposed to be very compassionate

132
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,145
They are more compassionate to
chickens than to human beings.

133
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:06,634
We have that kind.

134
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:13,543
At the same time I have seen in the
West also such materialistic people,

135
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:20,513
I mean, they have no shame.
So when you just turn and

136
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:27,120
see that, should abhor that,
abhor, it's shameful!

137
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:30,448
How could you be like that even
in Sahaja Yoga?

138
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:36,036
So as I have told you, there are
some people who are materialistic,

139
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:42,708
some people who are emotionalistic
and some people who are egoistic.

140
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:48,014
Now leave all these things on the
sides, then you come in the center.

141
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:51,056
Now you are in the center.

142
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:58,920
In the center, people enjoy just the love
of their Mother, like Shri Ganesha does.

143
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:06,765
Just think how your Mother loves you, finished!
Can you? This very sweet feeling

144
00:22:06,765 --> 00:22:10,081
And who is your Mother if you
really believe in Her, in Sahaja

145
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:16,501
Yoga, these two things should solve the problem.
No more thinking.

146
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,032
Just think how much your Mother loves

147
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:27,548
that means you are jumping onto My Kundalini
and when you jump onto My Kundalini,

148
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:33,936
then there is no thought,
you cannot think.

149
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:42,055
When you think that how much your Mother loves
you, you are jumping onto My Kundalini and

150
00:22:42,055 --> 00:22:45,349
that time there is no thought.

151
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:48,688
It is very simple to
meditate in Sahaja Yoga

152
00:22:48,688 --> 00:22:51,428
because you have somebody in person.

153
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:54,740
They never had somebody in person.

154
00:22:54,811 --> 00:22:57,201
So I can understand their problems,

155
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:59,418
there was nobody in person;

156
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,133
they had to do it in the air.

157
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:09,518
But here a sure shot thing:
you can feel your vibrations

158
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:19,866
you can feel My love and you
can feel your own quality.

159
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:26,349
It's very simple.

160
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:34,503
But it's not the love that is selfish, it's not the love where you

161
00:23:34,503 --> 00:23:37,967
say, Oh Mother loves me so She look after me,
She will do everything for me,

162
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:42,887
She is going to do
everything.

163
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:48,463
It's the love that other loves me so much,
what can I do for Her?

164
00:23:48,463 --> 00:23:54,197
Which is the best flower I can give to my Mother?

165
00:23:54,197 --> 00:23:56,996
What does She need? She needs nothing.

166
00:23:56,996 --> 00:24:03,879
She doesn't need money, She doesn't need anything.
What can I give Her?

167
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:06,475
Which is the best flower

168
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:14,647
Like Shri Hanuman was given a gold necklace by Shri Sitaji

169
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:19,550
and He saw that, and He was sitting on a tree and

170
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:29,304
He was breaking one by one all of those
big-big gold balls of His necklace.

171
00:24:29,304 --> 00:24:33,012
So Sitaji said, what are you doing?

172
00:24:33,012 --> 00:24:38,516
He said, I am trying to see in these balls where is Ram.?

173
00:24:38,516 --> 00:24:46,876
He said, none of them has, so I am just breaking
them to find out, otherwise why should I wear it?

174
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:50,149
And then She said, "Really? Where is Ram?"

175
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:57,552
He opened His chest. He said,
see in My chest. He exists there.

176
00:24:57,552 --> 00:25:02,786
So it is never one sided sort
of a thing, it is a thing that

177
00:25:02,786 --> 00:25:07,124
exists within you and you feel that
and then has to be reciprocal.

178
00:25:07,124 --> 00:25:19,852
In the water, if there is a ripple it goes
to the shores and then it returns back.

179
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:28,773
So with this force only, I tell you, you
can conquer your ego and super ego.

180
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:34,862
There is no way out.

181
00:25:34,862 --> 00:25:40,728
And for these Indians it is very easy to do because they

182
00:25:40,728 --> 00:25:45,989
know their Mother's love.

183
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:50,953
I know there has been an attack on that point and

184
00:25:50,953 --> 00:25:53,069
the mothers have been funny there.

185
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:58,085
But doesn't matter, when you see
something just put yourself to it.

186
00:25:58,085 --> 00:26:03,041
To feel your roots.

187
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:08,141
These are your roots, and then you see the enjoyment.

188
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:11,688
The Mother Earth Herself
is sucking you now.

189
00:26:11,688 --> 00:26:18,505
She is sucking you down.

190
00:26:18,505 --> 00:26:20,954
That is how you meditate now.

191
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:26,764
This is how you have to meditate, and it's
such a security giving thing.

192
00:26:26,764 --> 00:26:30,856
It will change your expressions, faces, everything.

193
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:43,063
And that enamored expression that you find in these
people will be on your face very soon

194
00:26:43,063 --> 00:26:51,993
And complete silence will exist once you come on My Kundalini,

195
00:26:51,993 --> 00:27:04,066
but not through your mental projections, but
through your meditative, spontaneous experience.

196
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:07,756
It's very joy giving.

197
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:10,605
Just feel the joy of that.

198
00:27:10,605 --> 00:27:18,869
You are all with Me here and the joy of that
feeling will really enlarge your hearts

199
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:24,597
and then, then you can give it to others.

200
00:27:24,597 --> 00:27:28,093
You don't have to be crazy about these things

201
00:27:28,093 --> 00:27:36,565
but just to feel it within yourself.

202
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:42,714
All right, now I move on to Indians because

203
00:27:42,714 --> 00:27:46,820
they are different style of people.

204
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,475
May God bless you!

205
00:27:51,475 --> 00:27:53,686
(Marathi talk)

206
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:45,652
Now, I was telling them, I must

207
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:51,077
translate it to you in English is the
most important point

208
00:40:51,077 --> 00:40:56,652
I was telling that now you are transformed,
now you have become saints, no doubt of it.

209
00:40:56,652 --> 00:40:59,571
Now from an egg you have become a bird,

210
00:40:59,571 --> 00:41:05,913
but, now what should happen to you?
Your Kundalini is still in the sacrum.

211
00:41:05,913 --> 00:41:11,153
How it has happened that now you
have got all the Ganesha Shakti?

212
00:41:11,153 --> 00:41:17,765
I have made you like Ganesha, in the same
pattern as I had made Ganesha you are made.

213
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:25,618
Now you have become a Ganesha,
and from this Ganesha stage,

214
00:41:25,618 --> 00:41:35,002
which you think you are a Ganesha now,
if I offer you a throne of Shri Ganesha,

215
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:40,542
if you have to sit on that throne
as a king, then what should happen?

216
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:45,815
Actually, that now your Kundalini should
not be anymore in the sacrum bone,

217
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:50,906
but in your stomach, because Ganesha's
Kundalini is in the stomach.

218
00:41:50,906 --> 00:41:54,169
In the stomach means in the Nabhi Chakra.

219
00:41:54,169 --> 00:42:00,755
Means all your seeking has been
so far in materialism,

220
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:06,459
has been in other things like in money, or in

221
00:42:06,459 --> 00:42:10,857
power or in love or whatever it was.

222
00:42:10,857 --> 00:42:16,188
But now your Kundalini itself
is in the Nabhi Chakra, means

223
00:42:16,188 --> 00:42:21,080
your seeking is nothing but
itself has become the Kundalini.

224
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:27,407
Your seeking has become the Kundalini,
means that you are the giver,

225
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:31,318
now you are the Guru, you have
now become the Guru.

226
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:37,279
When the Kundalini starts from the Nabhi
that means now you are the Guru,

227
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:43,639
now you have to give all the
blessings,everything, as a Guru does.

228
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:46,178
Now you all have become Gurus.

229
00:42:46,178 --> 00:42:49,248
But that's only possible when the Kundalini has risen,

230
00:42:49,248 --> 00:42:55,194
has lifted Her abode from the sacrum
to the stomach,

231
00:42:55,194 --> 00:43:00,609
and this stage, unless and until it has
arrived, you are not a confirmed Guru.

232
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:03,876
Once that has happened you
become a Guru and then

233
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:09,940
you can really impress
people and work it out.

234
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,160
It has to be done very fast.

235
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,912
It has to work out very fast
and for that, first of all,

236
00:43:15,912 --> 00:43:19,367
please get rid of your
entanglements which are stupid.

237
00:43:19,367 --> 00:43:23,223
If you really believe that you
have to progress in your seeking,

238
00:43:23,223 --> 00:43:28,154
that you have to have your Kundalini
coming up from your Nabhi,

239
00:43:28,154 --> 00:43:35,953
then please, please hurry up, please try to
work out, otherwise you are very few who

240
00:43:35,953 --> 00:43:44,831
have been given also the privilege of
doing My Puja, very few.

241
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:48,094
And those who have been given have a chance

242
00:43:48,094 --> 00:43:51,106
to develop to that stage, and
once you become that, all

243
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:56,670
of you who have achieved that
stage can become the Gurus.

244
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,305
And for that, you have to have only wisdom.

245
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:03,514
Wisdom, keep to your wisdom,

246
00:44:03,514 --> 00:44:09,182
and like Shri Ganesha has His
wisdom and in that wisdom He knew

247
00:44:09,182 --> 00:44:12,304
one thing: that His Mother was all powerful

248
00:44:12,304 --> 00:44:16,845
and that He doesn't have to worship
anybody else but His Mother.

249
00:44:16,845 --> 00:44:22,009
And He has to have all the
powers which are granted by Her.

250
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:27,887
His powers, no one, even Brahma,
Vishnu, Mahesha does not have.

251
00:44:27,887 --> 00:44:29,807
They cannot reach Ganesha;

252
00:44:29,807 --> 00:44:33,592
They cannot reach His stage because
They are one-sided but

253
00:44:33,592 --> 00:44:37,562
Shri Ganesha has all the powers,
all the Chaitanya powers He has.

254
00:44:37,562 --> 00:44:41,533
So to become like that, to be like
that,He should be your ideal:

255
00:44:41,533 --> 00:44:48,231
how He behaved and how He would sacrifice
anything for the sake of Mother.

256
00:44:48,231 --> 00:44:54,797
Here there are people who don't even
want to pay for something like a puja and ..stuff

257
00:44:54,797 --> 00:44:59,191
which you may just spend away
somewhere in nonsensical things,

258
00:44:59,191 --> 00:45:03,272
because your attention has to
be brought round completely.

259
00:45:03,272 --> 00:45:09,494
It has to be completely severed from
all these nonsensical entanglements

260
00:45:09,494 --> 00:45:13,951
and there should be less talking and more experiencing.

261
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:18,081
Then only it's going to work out.

262
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:26,723
It's a good pleasure and a great
thing to be here in this holy land,

263
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:30,188
it's a very holy place
you can see it, so peaceful.

264
00:45:30,188 --> 00:45:33,114
Try to feel the peace within yourself that

265
00:45:33,114 --> 00:45:36,732
is within every human being and after

266
00:45:36,732 --> 00:45:38,696
that you have to know that this

267
00:45:38,696 --> 00:45:42,615
peace that you are achieving
has to be given to others.

268
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:48,050
In Sahaja Yoga, perhaps you have realized,
whatever you have got from the nature,

269
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:50,667
you can release it back.

270
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:55,857
For example if you give vibrations
to a plant you can make it grow.

271
00:45:55,857 --> 00:46:01,632
If you give vibrations to a flower
you can make it sustain its life.

272
00:46:01,632 --> 00:46:04,879
For the first time you are giving
something to the nature,

273
00:46:04,879 --> 00:46:08,655
but as soon as you grow up to that state of a

274
00:46:08,655 --> 00:46:11,550
Guru then you can give the peace

275
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:18,810
that is in the nature, you can give the
feeling of bliss that is in the nature.

276
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:22,077
But first achieve it within yourself.

277
00:46:22,077 --> 00:46:28,665
Make this go inside you and see
that bliss settle down within you.

278
00:46:28,665 --> 00:46:32,334
You don't see other nonsensical
things which are very disturbing

279
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:34,425
sometimes to your western mind.

280
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:41,589
For example if a telephone is not working or the road is not all right, if the
bathroom is not this.

281
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:47,959
These nonsensical things have no meaning, but
feel the peace outside,

282
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:57,087
try to establish that peace within because
this peace you have to give to others.

283
00:46:57,087 --> 00:47:01,215
The whole development plan
that I have is very fast

284
00:47:01,215 --> 00:47:03,994
and I am sure you will keep pace with me.

285
00:47:03,994 --> 00:47:05,065
So may God bless you!

286
00:47:05,065 --> 00:47:11,972
When you sit down just feel the peace and
try to achieve that peace within yourself.

287
00:47:11,972 --> 00:47:16,894
Don't pay attention to nonsensical
things and this with this your little

288
00:47:16,894 --> 00:47:21,683
brain trying to criticize, but try to
achieve the peace within yourself so

289
00:47:21,683 --> 00:47:25,061
that you can give peace to others.

290
00:47:25,061 --> 00:47:31,217
It's not proper that some of you are looking after
the negative people all the time, it's not proper.

291
00:47:31,217 --> 00:47:33,082
You don't have to look
after the negative people.

292
00:47:33,082 --> 00:47:34,705
Just leave them alone.

293
00:47:34,705 --> 00:47:39,158
Keep out of that because negative
people can always bring you down.

294
00:47:39,158 --> 00:47:44,049
Don't try to improve the conditions of the
negative, leave them behind. You go fast.

295
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:49,962
Once you have achieved that state
then we can arrange for them to come.

296
00:47:49,962 --> 00:47:54,006
For example, if My car has failed, all
right, I got into another car, which

297
00:47:54,006 --> 00:47:56,578
was all right because I have to come to the program.

298
00:47:56,578 --> 00:48:00,000
Then I can send the tempo
from here to get that another

299
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,805
car where there were some people who
were not supposed to be at the program.

300
00:48:04,805 --> 00:48:08,924
That's how you have to be quick and
not bother your heads too much

301
00:48:08,924 --> 00:48:13,261
about the negative people who are sick
people, trying to be compassionate.

302
00:48:13,261 --> 00:48:14,246
There is no need.

303
00:48:14,246 --> 00:48:15,759
Tell them, tell Mother.

304
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,253
Let you talk to Mother.

305
00:48:17,253 --> 00:48:20,791
Look after yourselves and
don't be bothered about them.

306
00:48:20,791 --> 00:48:24,090
This is another nonsensical
idea of compassion you have got.

307
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:27,145
Compassion is not mental projection I told you:

308
00:48:27,145 --> 00:48:29,917
the compassion that works, that flows.

309
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:33,889
It's all mental you see for us
compassion is mental, every idea,

310
00:48:33,889 --> 00:48:39,484
peace is mental, bliss is mental, God
is mental, everything is mental for us.

311
00:48:39,484 --> 00:48:46,153
He is not. He is the one that
resides in the heart as Spirit.

312
00:48:46,153 --> 00:48:48,751
He is the one who works
through the compassion.

313
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:54,873
And now you know My compassion is
that it flows, it works, it acts.

314
00:48:54,873 --> 00:48:59,791
It's not mental.

315
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:05,368
So don't try to be mentally concerned
with people and try to be compassionate.

316
00:49:05,368 --> 00:49:06,341
All right?

317
00:49:06,341 --> 00:49:10,837
I hope you understand that the
compassion is not a mental idea

318
00:49:10,837 --> 00:49:15,309
that we are compassionate, we are working
for the unity of the world.And all that.

319
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:20,856
Even unity and all those ideas, even
the idea of collective understanding

320
00:49:20,856 --> 00:49:25,321
is in the heart, it should work.

321
00:49:25,321 --> 00:49:28,865
In Sanskrit it is Kaaryanvit.

322
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:32,068
In English there is no word. Kaaryanvit

323
00:49:32,068 --> 00:49:34,959
is embodied with the working capacity,

324
00:49:34,959 --> 00:49:37,810
embodied with the working out capacity

325
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,846
actually working out capacity
you can translate like that.

326
00:49:40,846 --> 00:49:41,886
It should work.

327
00:49:41,886 --> 00:49:46,238
If it does not work out then what's the use
of looking after somebody who is sick?

328
00:49:46,238 --> 00:49:51,087
all right, come along This is
nonsense, this is very mental.

329
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:59,331
Just don't waste your energy; you have
not come here to look after the sick.

330
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:06,362
I hope you understand this idea of looking after the
sick and being very

331
00:50:06,362 --> 00:50:09,627
is all ego-oriented, see we are trying to help the sick,

332
00:50:09,627 --> 00:50:13,496
we are trying to help this, that,?all ego-oriented.

333
00:50:13,496 --> 00:50:18,092
Another superego-oriented that we
are sacrificing this and that and

334
00:50:18,092 --> 00:50:23,158
we are becoming beggars in India like the
Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna. Beggars, parasites.

335
00:50:23,158 --> 00:50:26,697
Both are just the same, now
please don't do all these things

336
00:50:26,697 --> 00:50:36,214
and try to keep yourself glued to one ideal:

337
00:50:36,214 --> 00:50:39,628
that you have to ascend faster.

338
00:50:39,628 --> 00:50:46,041
You have to individually ascend faster
and collectively pull out everyone

339
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:50,769
but not those who are heavily
laden with problems and

340
00:50:50,769 --> 00:50:54,175
who are creating problems and
objecting your progress.

341
00:50:54,175 --> 00:50:58,008
That doesn't mean that you are
not compassionate.

342
00:50:58,008 --> 00:51:04,142
You know how much compassion that I have but
My compassion doesn't make stories,

343
00:51:04,142 --> 00:51:07,203
I am so compassionate and I am this and that.

344
00:51:07,223 --> 00:51:12,474
Up to a point is all right but don't so too much
bother about people who are dragging you behind.

345
00:51:12,474 --> 00:51:14,984
You have come here for a training,

346
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:23,333
a training into the understanding
of awareness which is compassion.

347
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:27,564
You all have to, even, when you go to the
school, you are not bothered about a person

348
00:51:27,564 --> 00:51:31,221
who is lacking in the
class, do you?

349
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,979
You want to study fast so that you come up well.

350
00:51:33,979 --> 00:51:37,432
In the same way, I would
request you not to bother your

351
00:51:37,432 --> 00:51:41,445
heads too much about people who
are trying to pull you down

352
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:44,371
because I don't want you to be pulled down.

353
00:51:44,371 --> 00:51:50,603
That's My compassion for them and for you.

354
00:51:50,603 --> 00:51:53,523
Let Me look after them and you just
don't worry your heads about them.

355
00:51:53,523 --> 00:51:56,586
They will be all right.

356
00:51:56,586 --> 00:51:57,742
So, may God bless you!

357
00:51:57,742 --> 00:52:04,812
Lets have a puja today, and
this puja will be simple today.

358
00:52:04,812 --> 00:52:10,473
I think we will have Ganesha's Puja and
then we will have Devi's Puja today,

359
00:52:10,552 --> 00:52:17,179
and then we will have a good havan.
That is a good place for havan.
