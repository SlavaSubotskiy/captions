1
00:00:07,089 --> 00:03:13,769
All these years, I 

2
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:22,810
have been waiting, for this day.

3
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:44,590
We have now, on the 21st Sahasrara, so 
is a very important, turning point as you

4
00:03:44,590 --> 00:04:06,260
know that every 21st day we change our calendars
as far as the horoscope is concerned.

5
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:13,030
And so now, is a new change has to come.

6
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:23,599
And you can see the announcement.

7
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:34,800
A new understanding, an awareness, of a very
new dimension.

8
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:46,530
We have been so far dealing with collective
consciousness.

9
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,100
We are collectively conscious.

10
00:04:50,100 --> 00:05:01,300
We have, the idea that we are collectively
conscious.

11
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:13,280
Also we know we are part and parcel of the
whole.

12
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,210
And that, we all are Sahaja Yogis.

13
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:31,260
We know about our chakras and our, nadis very
clearly.

14
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,030
But perhaps we do not know about our powers.

15
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:45,470
How many powers have developed in those twenty-one
years within yourself?[ROAR OF THUNDER OUTSIDE,

16
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:55,940
SHRI MATAJI SMILES ABOUT IT, YOGIS LAUGH & CLAP].

17
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:02,210
Last two months, Italy was burning with fire,
it was so very hot.

18
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,979
And I read reports that they are worried about
a drought and they want rain to come in and

19
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:13,100
now they think the time has passed away.

20
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:27,800
But how it works you see because, the All-pervading
Power knows everything and the whole nature

21
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,830
works for your benefit, for your programs.

22
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,790
At the right time things happen as you have
seen before.

23
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:43,190
They're completely coordinated, with our programs.

24
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,560
All the time they are helping you.

25
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,000
Whatever they have in them, serves as powers.

26
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,449
They are using them at the right time.

27
00:06:53,449 --> 00:07:07,069
Now be confident, that you have powers and
this is the new change that is going to come,

28
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:14,930
within your, own understanding.

29
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:20,729
So far only you know that you could feel the
vibrations.

30
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:24,340
That you could cure people.

31
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,960
You could help to cure, I mean still not so
confident.

32
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:34,550
That, you could feel the Paramchaitanya.

33
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:43,840
But you did not know what dynamic forces are
working in you now and this is a new change

34
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,520
that is going to come.

35
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,430
With this new change you have to assume a
new character.

36
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,100
And the new character is announcement.

37
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:03,710
So far I have told you not to talk about Sahaja
Yoga very openly, blatantly.

38
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,340
But now the time has come.

39
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,530
We waited long, for these days.

40
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:15,550
Now you have to all start, talking about it,
announcing about it and telling about it to

41
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,889
everyone.

42
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:21,910
Otherwise the world would say that we never
knew about it.

43
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:31,300
All other false gurus are so well known all
over because their disciples are talking about

44
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:39,110
them all the places wherever they can, to
all the, big offices they go, to big people

45
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,110
they go.

46
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,190
They go to all the important people, just
go and tell them what they have.

47
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:53,280
So far we had kept Sahaja Yoga at a low ebb
because I wanted you, first of all to develop

48
00:08:53,280 --> 00:09:02,070
into really, very, beautiful Sahaja Yogis
so that from your life, from your life style,

49
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:09,070
from your behaviour, from your understanding,
from your thoughts, people will realise that

50
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:17,580
these people are very unique, and very different
type of people.

51
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:26,270
Now that, assumption, has to be there.

52
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:36,440
You have to understand, that all these powers
are bubbling in you, and just out of formality

53
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:45,500
or maybe out of shyness, or maybe little cowardice,
you are hiding them.

54
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:52,790
The other day there was a Sahaja Yogi who
came to My house and he saw some flowers which

55
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,460
were fading away.

56
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,380
I said, "They are not fading.

57
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,470
You can give them life."

58
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,470
He said, "How?"

59
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,780
I said, "You cut the bottom off all of them
and put your hand underneath."

60
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:28,100
And he just put his hands under the base of
the stem and he said, "Mother they're still

61
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
drooping."

62
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,830
I said, "Alright, now leave them in the water."

63
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,950
His attention was here and there, within fifteen
days they all stood up.

64
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,950
Alright.

65
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:44,270
Roots started growing, they became bigger
flowers and lasted for five days more after

66
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,810
that.

67
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:51,930
Then he was convinced.

68
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:58,880
You can do so many things, to convince yourself
that you have these powers.

69
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,640
I have seen people who have certain problems.

70
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,150
They have a headache.

71
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,210
They have this, that they come to Me.

72
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,920
Write big letters, "Mother I get my headache.

73
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,420
I can't get rid of it."

74
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,990
Now those days are gone where Mother has to
cure your headache, look after your wife,

75
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,680
look after your children.

76
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,860
Is all finished now.

77
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:36,740
Now you are responsible, not only for yourself,
but, for your ashrams, for your cities, for

78
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,850
your countries and for the whole world.

79
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:45,260
Now assume your powers.

80
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:51,410
Like yesterday he sang this, or he played
the "Royal Court".

81
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,710
So now you are in the Royal Court.

82
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,540
Take up your responsibilities.

83
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,360
Everybody has to feel responsible and assume,
what you are.

84
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,390
Know your powers.

85
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,990
What you can do.

86
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,170
Sit down.

87
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,570
Now the days are gone when you had to sit
down and count your blessings.

88
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,750
Now you have to count your powers.

89
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:21,370
How many powers I have and what I can use
and how I can use it.

90
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,500
No use counting your miracles.

91
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,350
You have had enough miracles to prove that
you are Sahaja Yogis and that you are helped

92
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,650
by the Paramchaitanya.

93
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:36,370
But now know how much of that Paramchaitanya
you are going to use yourself, how you are

94
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:42,190
going to maneuver it and how you are going
to work out.

95
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:49,180
This is the new era, we are starting from
today.

96
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:56,380
And this is the day I was waiting for all
of you, to realize, that you are not Sahaja

97
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:04,351
Yogis for only your selfish ends, nor for
your families, nor for your communities, nor

98
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:07,590
for your country, but for the whole world.

99
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,090
Expand yourself.

100
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:15,130
You must have that vision before you, that
I have put many-a-times before you people

101
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,290
that you have to emancipate the humanity.

102
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,290
Now don't have diffidence.

103
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:25,950
First of all you should not think that, "We
are very ordinary people.

104
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,520
We are very ordinary.

105
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,990
We haven't got something special about."

106
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:36,890
This work is not going to be done by special
people because they are suffering from ego.

107
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:44,980
It is going to be done by people who don't
have that ego, of great success, or of great

108
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,110
achievements or riches or anything.

109
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,930
If they are rid of this then only they can
work it out.

110
00:13:51,930 --> 00:14:00,610
And that's why it is for you to understand
what Christ has said that a camel can pass

111
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:08,200
through the hole of a needle but not a rich
man.

112
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,250
Because the ego is too big, bigger than a
camel, bigger than an elephant, any animal

113
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,730
you could think of.

114
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:24,020
That's why now, as we are entering into new
awareness, let us not worry about our negative

115
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,740
thinking.

116
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,050
So first is the diffidence, "How can I be?

117
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,870
I am not alright.

118
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,040
I was like this.

119
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,800
I was doing like this.

120
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,940
I had done like this."

121
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:45,760
So many letters of confessions come to Me,
pages after pages which I throw away or burn

122
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
them off.

123
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,550
There is no need to confess anymore.

124
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:54,080
There's only one confession that, "I am a
Sahaja Yogi and now, after 21st of Sahasrara,

125
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,640
I am a Mahayogi."

126
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,020
This is the confession you have to make and
no more of all these out of date things that

127
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,160
people tell Me about your family's life, all
mundane nonsensical things.

128
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,240
We have given them up and we have come to
Sahaja Yoga for our ascent.

129
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,810
We have achieved our ascent and now for what?

130
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,970
For what?

131
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:26,790
Have achieved our ascent is, to emancipate
human beings, to help them out of the mire

132
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:32,320
of ignorance, of darkness.

133
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:41,560
The main target I feel today should not be
so much political as fundamentalism.

134
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,030
So we have to openly say to these fundamentalists
that, "You are nonsensical.

135
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,030
You don't know the truth.

136
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,570
You don't know anything about truth.

137
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,820
You don't know that you are the spirit.

138
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,020
You don't know that there is a power that
is working."

139
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,270
You have to tell them very clearly, "You are
all stupid people running after something

140
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:04,280
that is a mirage and all of you will end up
into hell as described by all the scriptures."

141
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,680
We have to openly say it, these things, which
ever way you like.

142
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
You may write books.

143
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
You may publish it.

144
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,910
You may tell people about it.

145
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:17,110
But now the new announcement has to come,
to say that, "Running after falsehood is not

146
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,340
going to take you to God."

147
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:25,430
And, in that they have used the power of hatred.

148
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:31,130
So you have to say that, "We believe in the
power of love and not in the power of hatred

149
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,610
that you believe in."

150
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:40,432
For us everybody is capable of finding the
truth and is capable of getting to the, heaven

151
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:49,300
of that 
paradise which is promised to us, the kingdom

152
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,920
of God.

153
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,750
So for us, everybody, whether they belong
to this community, that community, this race

154
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:04,309
or that race, whatever it is, we believe,
not that, but we are sure, that we all are

155
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:11,100
quite capable and blessed by God, that we
should enter into His kingdom.

156
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:17,569
If you take this kind of a positive attitude
your negativity will go away.

157
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,871
Negative forces, as you know, you have been
pulled down by this kind of a thing or that

158
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:24,120
kind of a thing.

159
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,699
Specially after Sahaja Yoga.

160
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:29,120
Before Sahaja yoga we are not attached to
any families or anything.

161
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,279
After Sahaja Yoga you just got attached to
your families like, glued to them, absolutely

162
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,279
glued.

163
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,030
I mean I had to solve everybody's family problem.

164
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:43,250
Now we have marriages and even [THE...del],
after marriages, I find still people don't

165
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,350
understand what is a Sahaja Yoga marriage,
and there are still some problems, very few,

166
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,000
but there are.

167
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,240
So this nonsensical problem of my family,
my wife, my children, my house, my property,

168
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,059
my money - all this "my" should be finished
first of all.

169
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:04,950
You have to belong to the world.

170
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:12,250
Any person who is a king does not belong to
his kingdom, is a failure, is useless.

171
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:19,720
If he thinks about himself, about his own
comfort, about his own fame, about his own

172
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,640
achievements, then he's a failure.

173
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,419
He has to think about the country, on which
he's ruling.

174
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:35,070
In the same way you have to also, turn your
mind away from all these petty things that

175
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,210
you have been dealing with.

176
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:41,290
I've been struggling with you, trying to help
you for every small little nonsensical things.

177
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,299
And many people said that, "Mother, why should
you worry?

178
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:44,299
You are a Saint.

179
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:45,399
Why should you worry about these things?"

180
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:50,200
I said, "Unless and until these entanglements
are taken away, they are not going to come

181
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
up."

182
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,950
But now, now, you do feel that freedom.

183
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,370
Complete freedom.

184
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,870
You are an individual.

185
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,899
You are absolutely free.

186
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:02,350
And the source of your joy is your spirit.

187
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,980
You are not entangled with anyone.

188
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,029
You are not any way attached to anyone.

189
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:14,280
In that detachment you are going to nourish
everyone, inclusive of so-called your family,

190
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,470
your people, your country and ultimately the
world.

191
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:27,169
So to get rid of negativity first, important
thing is to learn detachment.

192
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,029
Detachment comes through thoughtless awareness.

193
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:35,570
When you look at anyone or start thinking
about anyone, get to your state of thoughtless

194
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,570
awareness.

195
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,940
Immediately you'll feel detached and you'll
know the solution of the whole problem.

196
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,000
Now the greatest power you have is in your
brain.

197
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,580
That you are knowledgeable.

198
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,090
Not knowledgeable the way you understand that
what is the chakra, what is the center.

199
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,090
Not that.

200
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,860
But there's all knowledge within you.

201
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:02,149
Just you have to, get into thoughtless awareness,
and the whole library of knowledge can open

202
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:03,149
to you.

203
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:08,990
You know so many of you have never been speaking
on the stage, they had stage fear, and you

204
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,610
have become great speakers.

205
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:17,669
So many of you were possessed people, who
couldn't even stand before Me, have now become,

206
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:21,120
leaders and are doing good job.

207
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,360
In every field you'll find that you have advanced
so much.

208
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,470
So many people who never knew how to sing
have started singing.

209
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,019
Did not know how to paint have started painting.

210
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:38,840
But these are, very very mundane things which
may give us little pleasures here and there.

211
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,320
But the main thing is how many people we give
realization to.

212
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,590
Whether you are a woman, whether you are a
man, whether you are a father, whether you

213
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:52,649
are a mother, whether you are a child or a
grown-up.

214
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:57,309
Everybody has to see how many people we can
give realization to, how much we can announce

215
00:20:57,309 --> 00:20:58,879
about Sahaja Yoga.

216
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:01,399
That's the main thing.

217
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:03,210
Sahaja Yoga is not "by the way".

218
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,210
And it happens.

219
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:09,929
Like when I went to Australia I was surprised,
that, Sahaja Yoga which was such a prime thing

220
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:12,860
for them, suddenly became "by the way".

221
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,789
So Sahaja Yoga is a commitment.

222
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:17,070
Is a commitment.

223
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,200
And complete involvement.

224
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,710
Otherwise you are really useless for Sahaja
Yoga.

225
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,710
Absolutely useless.

226
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:29,220
It's better to have few people who are committed
than to have thousands who are just useless.

227
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:36,289
So let us see what you have decided for yourself
and what you have decided for Sahaja Yoga.

228
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:41,240
If you have decided to opt for Sahaja Yoga
then just, know that, this is the main thing

229
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,009
which you have to do.

230
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:44,960
The whole attention should be on that.

231
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:54,299
As I told this morning, a very good poem written
by Namadeva and once was included in the Guru

232
00:21:54,299 --> 00:22:00,080
Granth Sahib, that a boy is playing with his
kite and the kite is flying in the air.

233
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,260
He's talking to everyone, but his attention
is on the kite.

234
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,499
There's a lady who is doing all the household
work.

235
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:15,571
She's doing all the cleaning but the child
is [ON HER...del.] on her back or on her waist.

236
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:17,059
All her attention is on the child.

237
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:20,279
Then there are ladies who are taking water
home.

238
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:25,419
There's a water pitcher on their heads, sometimes
two, sometimes three.

239
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:27,290
They are carrying, balancing it.

240
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,519
They are talking to each other, laughing.

241
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,210
The whole attention is on the balance.

242
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:36,929
In the same way your attention should be,
all the time on Sahaja Yoga, "What's happening

243
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:37,929
in Sahaja Yoga?

244
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:38,929
Where are we?

245
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:39,929
Where are we going?

246
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:40,929
Where is Mother?

247
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:41,929
What part She is?

248
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:46,299
What is She doing?"

249
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:53,559
That is, now if you put your attention to,
your negativity, will absolutely disappear

250
00:22:53,559 --> 00:23:00,159
because attention which was involved into
negative things will get absolutely detached

251
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,389
and you'll start thinking about Sahaja Yoga.

252
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:07,840
So now as you are mahayogis we have to make
it a Mahayoga.

253
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,279
And unless and until that level is achieved
by you then we should think that we are still

254
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:20,649
backdated and I don't know in the turning
of the wheel how many will be left, there.

255
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:27,640
So this is very big turning point and today
is a very great day for us because, Sahasrara

256
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:37,059
today, has completed its twenty-one years
and like that it is has twenty-one aspects.

257
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:39,299
Seven the chakras.

258
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:42,110
Seven into three of your nadis.

259
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:50,250
So it's twenty-one aspects, you have able
to achieve and the twenty-one powers.

260
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,259
You just experiment and see for yourself.

261
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:54,799
Don't doubt yourself.

262
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,999
Just experiment.

263
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:59,960
First you used to even doubt if there is cool
breeze or not, you used to think it's an air

264
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,679
conditioner working in London.

265
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,760
Even London they used to think there must
be air conditioner in their head.

266
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,019
Now those days are gone.

267
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:18,179
Now don't doubt yourself and just go, full
ahead, with all the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga.

268
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,119
So the maryada has to be there.

269
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:33,529
Except that the moral maryadas and also, of,
behavioral, maryadas, there are not many maryadas

270
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:35,220
in Sahaja Yoga.

271
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,990
You can do what you like, you can live the
way you like, you can eat the way you want

272
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,179
to eat.

273
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:46,640
But the main maryada is that you have to be
very moral people, honest moral people.

274
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:57,139
And also, you have to be, in a way, in appearance,
in behavior, such a person that you do not

275
00:24:57,139 --> 00:25:04,179
become obnoxious or people don't think you
are queer, strange, people.

276
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:11,230
To overcome that, we have to dress up, in
a way that is, rather more appealing to the

277
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:18,240
general public and people see us as normal
human being and as not abnormal human beings.

278
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,960
There's not much to be done outside.

279
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,350
It is the inside, where we'll have to prepare
ourselves, fully, to accept ourselves.

280
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:32,480
To tell ourselves, every day, that we are
now mahayogis and we have to work it out that

281
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,480
way.

282
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,390
Today we have here, people from all over the
world, and you go and tell this message to

283
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:44,049
all the rest of the people whom I've not met
that, "Mother has already announced - through

284
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:48,240
the Vishnumaya also[MOTHER REFERS TO THE THUNDER
OUTSIDE...ed] - that you all have become now,

285
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
mahayogis."

286
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,059
And try to express that.

287
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:53,789
Manifest that.

288
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:56,869
With full confidence in yourself.

289
00:25:56,869 --> 00:26:06,549
And with this power of love I'm sure you'll
all win over.

290
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:15,200
May God bless you all.

291
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,770
There has been nothing written about Sahasrara
before.

292
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,649
In none of the scriptures Sahasrara is described.

293
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:24,270
Nobody knew anything about Sahasrara.

294
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,769
They just, left it as the seventh chakra.

295
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:28,769
Finished.

296
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:33,909
They could only go up to Agnya, and nothing
has been written about Sahasrara so far.

297
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:38,190
And there is no, no mantras written about
Sahasrara.

298
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,679
So we have to now write Sahasrara Mantra.

299
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:49,659
It is very surprising, that even the photographs
of Sahasraras have appeared now for you to

300
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:56,820
see, that your Sahasraras are opening and
that is [A...del] something that never happened

301
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:02,289
before, in the whole spiritual history.

302
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:07,880
And nobody could write about it because, they
never saw this Sahasrara.

303
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:14,429
Now for you it is important to see, that you
have something so unique with you.

304
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:25,450
But only thing what you need is a courage
and a complete commitment, to go forward with

305
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:30,169
this propagation of Sahaja Yoga, announcement
of Sahaja Yoga.
