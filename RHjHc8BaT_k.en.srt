1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,320
The chakras, the energy centers

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,880
which are inside each and all of us.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,160
Perhaps for new people I can give a very

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,880
quick summary of what was said then, and then go on.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,640
Shri Mataji will be here quite soon.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,000
You are here because there is a desire

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,680
to see, to understand, to know, to be with

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,600
something more than the day to day.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,720
Some sort of reality, some sort of truth, some sort of

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,920
explanation,

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,000
some sort of all embracing

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,200
idea, concept, vision,

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,480
which places creation into a context,

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,320
somewhere there.

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,240
That seeking has taken us in many directions.

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,160
Some of us to

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,160
false and damaging teachers,

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,960
some to drugs,

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,200
some to opting out,

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,720
but

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,480
so, it’s led everybody else of course everybody here tonight

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,480
to this particular function.

23
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,240
Shri Mataji is offering an experience.

24
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,080
It's not self-certification, it's not like being

25
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,160
born again, I am born again, I am born again.

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,120
It's not a statement of belief,

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,600
it is an actual physical happening.

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,400
And that physical happening is known as Self-realization.

29
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,360
It's known as the Ruh to the Muslims,

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,200
it's known as the Moksha to the Hindus,

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,480
is known as enlightenment, liberation,

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,800
second birth.

33
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,600
There are a number of names for it.

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,360
Christ referred to it as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

35
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,880
But it is all the same thing, it is

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,760
this experience which links the energy within us

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,320
to the all pervading energy of God.

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,120
The yoga, yoga means union,

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,200
and that union is in fact this,

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,920
the union of this energy here

41
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,600
which lies in the sacrum bone at the bottom of the spine,

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,720
is a physical thing, which in the presence of an authorised person

43
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,280
rises through the central channel

44
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,400
and piercing the top of the head, the fontanel bone,

45
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,240
actually comes from the top of the head as a cool breeze.

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:11,320
It also manifests on the hands as cool vibrations.

47
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,920
And another thing that happens then is,

48
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,880
that this, these cool vibrations

49
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,680
and this experience, makes one collectively conscious.

50
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,280
It is a new step, it is another step in evolution.

51
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,440
It is, perhaps to put it one way, a move from

52
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,200
the human being to a spiritual being.

53
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,920
Now what happens when this,

54
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,080
the Kundalini, this energy at the bottom of the spine rises?

55
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,640
It pierces a number of energy centers in the body.

56
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,320
Before we go on, looks we are going to have more people

57
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,320
here than seats.

58
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,040
Is it possible -

59
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,360
how are those seats linked together? Are they separate?

60
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,320
I am just wondering if there is any possibility of

61
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,880
perhaps just easing the seats back and anybody who

62
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,680
would like to come forward and sit on the floor here.

63
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,480
They are all linked.

64
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,000
Is there any chance of just easing the seats back,

65
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,520
is that practical? Just to give us a little more space here ine front.

66
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,400
The desire for creation came,

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
which is represented here by this left channel.

68
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,200
Then, what we with the Christian background know

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,120
as the Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit,

70
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,920
then became the force, that force of God

71
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,120
which brought about creation.

72
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,720
And creation is two parts, or two parts of it,

73
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,640
two aspects of it I should say. One is the desire

74
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,720
and the other is the creation itself.

75
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,320
So we have two

76
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,400
channels, on the left and the right.

77
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,240
One on the left and one on the right.

78
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,040
The left hand one is concerned with

79
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,240
yesterday, the past, the female aspect in us,

80
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,840
the emotional,

81
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,560
that sense of desire, introspection.

82
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,040
The right hand side is action.

83
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,560
That is tomorrow, that is

84
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,640
planning, that is organising, that is dominating,

85
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,000
that is being an outgoing personality,

86
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,440
that is putting the attention out all the time.

87
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,480
Taken to an extreme in the left

88
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,400
there is a tendency or extending the left rather,

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,160
one comes into the subconscious.

90
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,760
Everything that has happened in the past is here.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,120
It is possible further one comes to the left

92
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,960
the more one comes involved in the past.

93
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,680
And it is possible on the right hand side

94
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,800
for this to go further and further into the right,

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,920
and so it becomes fanatical, dry

96
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,240
and that's the area of heart attacks and

97
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,600
those overactive diseases which are so prevalent in the West.

98
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,800
The West tends to be very active.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,080
The Eastern countries tend to be more on the left.

100
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,800
Well, we talk about left and right, what does that mean?

101
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,560
I was pointing out the other night that if we say something,

102
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,120
"Oh I wish I hadn't said that to somebody,” now that's on the left,

103
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,880
"Oh I wish I hadn't said that.

104
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,920
Tomorrow when I see him again I will say this to him,”

105
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,200
that's on the right.

106
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,520
So we have gone, "Oh gee I am sorry",

107
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,440
and we have come over to the right for tomorrow I will do this.

108
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,280
At the point of crossing there is this little moment

109
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,040
right in the center and that is 'now',

110
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,080
when crossed from the past

111
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,200
from the past to the future,

112
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,360
there is a crossing point which is 'now'.

113
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,760
And that crossing point is this central channel

114
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,160
that the Kundalini, this energy,

115
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,320
rises up in the process of Self-realization.

116
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,640
Rising - this Mooladhara sits actually below,

117
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,440
the energy center sits below the source of the Kundalini,

118
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,880
where the Kundalini originates in the sacrum bone.

119
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,320
The first one up mentioned -

120
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,320
the next one is the Nabhi, the green one.

121
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,880
Nabhi is concerned with our sustenance. In other words

122
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,160
we are not, if you like to think of it in terms of evolution

123
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,760
the Mooladhara is concerned with that innocence

124
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,880
that original innocence.

125
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,600
Then comes the consciousness,

126
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,880
the need for food, for shelter, those basic needs,

127
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,480
that is the territory of the Nabhi.

128
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,120
That is also the area of our evolution.

129
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,520
The next chakra is the Swadhistan,

130
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
coming back, and why it's the second chakra,

131
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,760
because the Swadhistan circles around the Nabhi.

132
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,040
Swadhistan is concerned with,

133
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,400
the Swadhistan is concerned with

134
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,480
those aspects of creativity, the need to do something.

135
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,400
Have we got any seats down here?

136
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,440
Yes

137
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,280
Well I think we have still quite a lot of room down here,

138
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,840
if anybody would like to come forward and

139
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,360
and.. and sit.. and clear some seats.

140
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,640
Are you happy standing there at the back?

141
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,240
Here is still quite a bit of sitting room at the front here.

142
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,760
So, again quickly going through these,-

143
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,400
the Swadhistan on the left is concerned

144
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,720
with truth, aspects of truth

145
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,200
and understanding when - what happens

146
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:27,200
prior to realization is that these centers

147
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,040
as we become involved in various activities, day to day activities,

148
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,760
and they become damaged, they pick up

149
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,120
aspects of perhaps unrighteousness or

150
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,160
those adharmic things settle on to the chakras

151
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,880
and this is what Self-realization itself starts to clear.

152
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,280
In other words, Self-realization starts to cleanse the chakras.

153
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,840
It starts to mend the damages.

154
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,680
It starts to solve the problems.

155
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,640
So from the wisdom in Mooladhara

156
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,400
it comes to sense of evolution and sustenance in the Nabhi,

157
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,400
creativity here in the Swadhistan

158
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,080
and then there is this green circle which is

159
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,400
called various things,

160
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,040
the 'sea of illusion' it is frequently and poetically referred to.

161
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,080
It is that area which must be crossed

162
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,760
if we are to make the transition between the material world

163
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,320
and the spiritual world.

164
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,640
And we have all sorts of guides there like Moses and Abraham

165
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,640
and Lao Tzu and Confucius

166
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,240
and - and I think -

167
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,160
Here is Shri Mataji now!

168
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,960
Say a few words, you say first a few words then only I talk.

169
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,400
Good evening ladies and gentleman.

170
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,760
It's wonderful to see a capacity crowd here, I think that

171
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,280
Adelaide deserves the blessings of Shri Mataji and

172
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,040
tonight they are going to get it.

173
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,160
So many people came the other night on Saturday and

174
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,840
gained their Self-realization, they followed it up with

175
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,120
a beautiful workshop program on Sunday, and

176
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,440
many people are busily working it out.

177
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,240
It's a growing process, and

178
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,280
Sahaja Yoga is spreading very very strongly.

179
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,720
You see all of us have to attain that fulfilment

180
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,720
that we've been seeking for so many lives.

181
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,240
That fulfilment that is known in the scriptures

182
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,000
to the Christian as

183
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,120
being born again some people call it Self-realization.

184
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,320
In the Hindu philosophy it's called Atma Sakshat, Self-realization.

185
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,720
In the Mohammeden scriptures it's becoming a peer,

186
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,440
when they begin to feel this cool wind of the Holy Spirit,

187
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,840
they begin to feel it in their awareness

188
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,440
consciously on their hands and

189
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,720
coming from the top of their head,

190
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,240
feel it as vibrations of the unconscious.

191
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,680
And this vibration that they feel

192
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,280
is the verification and the manifestation that they have

193
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,160
at last made that connection with the unconscious.

194
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,920
This is the result and the reward of

195
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,800
so many lives when they have been seeking God.

196
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,160
And so many people here tonight are in that category.

197
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,680
There are so many negative forces which have been trying to stop us.

198
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,520
So much confusion in this age of darkness which is known,

199
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,480
and has been known as the Kali Yuga.

200
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,160
So much confusion and frustration of modern living in which

201
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,000
people begin to wonder which way to turn,

202
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,440
who is truth and who is falsehood,

203
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,880
who is the real teacher,

204
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,240
who is the false teacher.

205
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,280
Shri Mataji has come to do one job only,

206
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,720
and that is to awaken this subtle energy within us,

207
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,640
that energy which we can as

208
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,480
the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

209
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,640
She’s come to awaken it and put us

210
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,880
in touch with our Self, our Spirit.

211
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,600
When that happens

212
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,920
you begin

213
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,520
to feel the bliss and the joy

214
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,200
of that final aspect of your spiritual ascent.

215
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
So

216
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,480
be open minded for those people that have come for the first time,

217
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,240
be prepared to receive something great,

218
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,800
be prepared to assume

219
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,840
that you can become that higher being,

220
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,480
that you can in fact become a spiritual being.

221
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
There are so many anti-Christs,

222
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,400
there is so many forces of negativity, there is so much confusion

223
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,120
in the world today and so many

224
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,720
people have come on this earth whether as

225
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,040
I said anti-Christs

226
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:27,040
or else confused people to mislead us,

227
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,080
and to perhaps take us through the highways and byways

228
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,520
in our seeking.

229
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
Self-realization establishes something

230
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,360
within you in which you can discriminate.

231
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,600
In which you can know truth from falsehood.

232
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,240
In Sahaja Yoga which is what happens

233
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,080
when you get your realization -

234
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,200
Sahaja Yoga means spontaneous Self-realization -

235
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,480
when that happens

236
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,040
you become a collective being.

237
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,280
You become collectively conscious,

238
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,200
you start to feel on your finger tips

239
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,520
the centers of others, you start to feel in your awareness

240
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,720
what is happening within your own subtle body.

241
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,240
You can give realization to others.

242
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,760
You can discriminate between the people who are seekers

243
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,880
and the people who are false.

244
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,040
You can discriminate between those who

245
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,680
wish their spiritual ascent

246
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,960
and those who are opposing evolution.

247
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,600
And this is important because we have never had any yard stick

248
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,280
by which we could judge other than our mental activity,

249
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,080
other than our emotional activity.

250
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,760
Now, when you get your Self-realization you have that yard stick.

251
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,360
You have that immutable measure by which

252
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,680
you can assume truth.

253
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,320
When you begin to feel the truth

254
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,400
on your finger tips

255
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,360
as the cool wind of the Holy Spirit,

256
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,760
as that power that lies within you,

257
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,720
you know for certain that you have met

258
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,120
that aspect of your nature which is indeed truth.

259
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,800
There will always be people who try to persuade you otherwise,

260
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,600
there will always be the prophets of doom

261
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,680
that this world is going to be destroyed and so many things.

262
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,840
But just ask yourself if the God Almighty that

263
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,400
created this earth, is going to destroy His own creation.

264
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,760
We all have to get our Self-realization.

265
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,160
We all have to become part and parcel of the Kingdom of God.

266
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,960
We all have to become witness to the play of the Divine.

267
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,360
We all have to become like Christ.

268
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,880
We have to become the principle that is the Spirit.

269
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,720
And ultimately when we achieve that

270
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,720
the final joy of Self-realization,

271
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
begins it’s process

272
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,960
of taking us to that final union with God.

273
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,680
In Sahaja Yoga

274
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,800
the first experience of Self-realization may be very subtle,

275
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,560
it may be very slight, and you may be a little unconvinced.

276
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,720
Unconvinced rationally or in terms of perception.

277
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,840
Because as I said this subtle

278
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,120
cool wind that you begin to feel on your hand

279
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,120
may in fact be very very slight.

280
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,200
It may be because this chakra here is a little blocked because

281
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,920
of damage to that center,

282
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,440
so don't despair if you don't feel it the first time.

283
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,120
Know that inside yourself

284
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,920
something great has happened.

285
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,360
And when that great happening takes place

286
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,160
you owe it to yourself to develop it.

287
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,760
Thousands of people are developing it around the world.

288
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,960
In Australia it's growing

289
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,800
and it's growing very strongly.

290
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,840
Mother believes that Adelaide is going to be one of the centers

291
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,240
where it grows strongest.

292
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,080
Already so many people have got it.

293
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,040
Already so many of the real seekers

294
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,600
have come and had the blessings of Mother.

295
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,720
Already they are feeling

296
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,120
the Kundalini within themselves, they are feeling

297
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,120
the cool wind, they are attaining their Spirit.

298
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,120
This is what we have been all seeking.

299
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,080
This has been our goal whether we have been a Christian,

300
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,080
or a Jew or a Hindu or a Muslim,

301
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,560
whatever it may be, this has been the goal

302
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,720
and yet we are all one,

303
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,680
we are all part of God Almighty. There is no difference.

304
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,560
What the Buddha said is no different to what Christ has said.

305
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,480
What the Hindu scriptures and the saints

306
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,880
have said is no different

307
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,120
to what Mohammed has said.

308
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,520
They have all said the same thing.

309
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,360
So we have to become that integrating force

310
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,080
that is a realized soul.

311
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,200
We have to get the enlightenment, we have to awaken within ourselves

312
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,040
the divinity that has been sleeping there for so many births,

313
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,200
and we have to get the reward of all our seeking.

314
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,960
Mother is the one who can deliver the goods,

315
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,480
Mother is the one who can awaken the Kundalini.

316
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,080
She is the one who can slowly

317
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,480
and patiently and lovingly nourish Her children

318
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,800
after they get their Self-realization.

319
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,480
She is the one who is respected by the saints

320
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,320
as the Mother, as the Mataji

321
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,040
who has come on this earth to give the blessings of God

322
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,560
to the seekers, and to give the creation it's own meaning.

323
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,720
So without any further introduction from me

324
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,800
it gives me great pleasure ladies and gentlemen

325
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,760
to introduce to you again

326
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,720
Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

327
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,760
To all the seekers of truth, I bow.

328
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,120
We have to be the true seekers of truth,

329
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,280
which is a rare quality people think,

330
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,640
but I have found out that in this world

331
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,600
there are many

332
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,440
seekers who are honestly and earnestly seeking.

333
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,800
They are seeking the truth.

334
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,640
They are trying to find out

335
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,640
what is within them,

336
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,560
they are trying to find out what is being prophesied about them.

337
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,120
It has been prophesied that the day of judgment will come.

338
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,720
This is the day of judgment,

339
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,360
when you are going to be judged.

340
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,440
You are not going to be put into any scales

341
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,280
or there is no other measure by which you are going to be judged

342
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,720
but by knowing

343
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,680
how far truthful you are about your seeking

344
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,760
and how far you can gain something about it.

345
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,160
Today I had a chance

346
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,920
to be with some media people

347
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,080
and yesterday also.

348
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,080
I feel some of them just want to bring some controversy

349
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,600
to make it more interesting perhaps.

350
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,440
Whatever it is -

351
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,160
as a Mother I have to tell you that I have to take nothing from you.

352
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,960
I have come here to give you.

353
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,760
If you are identified with any organization

354
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,520
or you think you can fight for an organization

355
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,640
it would be very much better that you should not disturb us,

356
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,840
who are the people who are real seekers sitting down here.

357
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,760
It would be very civil of you to be

358
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,800
away from us, because we are not identified with any organization,

359
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,080
but with our own Self.

360
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,800
We have no organization you know in Sahaja Yoga.

361
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,720
And every type of a person is allowed to come in Sahaja Yoga,

362
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:52,680
so that he gets the full advantage of his destiny.

363
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,960
In My own

364
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,920
experiences I have found out

365
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,880
that people in the West are rather difficult

366
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,360
to get realization to begin with.

367
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,960
In India there can be six thousand people

368
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,920
and just in a split of a second

369
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,080
their Kundalini rises and they get their realization.

370
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,680
It’s a fact. But even when they get realization

371
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,400
they are not so seriously adhering to it

372
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,920
and they don't try to learn about the technique

373
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,360
of the laws of God's Love.

374
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,920
But in the West on the contrary,

375
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,240
though the first motion is very slow,

376
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,800
some people get it and lose it,

377
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,840
but they are very great seekers.

378
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,960
They get completely transformed.

379
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,480
I have seen people who have been drunkards, alcoholics,

380
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,800
who have been taking drugs and who have been homosexuals,

381
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,880
who led a very wretched life,

382
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,880
did all kinds of nonsensical things to ruin themselves.

383
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,560
Once they get realization they really become so

384
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,240
aware of themselves their self esteem rises

385
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,200
and they take to Sahaja Yoga

386
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,920
in a very proper auspicious way.

387
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,720
It's something surprising

388
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,200
that those who can get realization very fast

389
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,800
are not so good for giving realization to others.

390
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,440
They do not seem to understand

391
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,600
that it has to be given to other people.

392
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,640
While those who take more time,

393
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,080
those who have suffered so much,

394
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,280
those who have had a miserable life before,

395
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,320
those people who could be condemned as

396
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,320
the worst people on this earth

397
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,720
become so beautiful, not only that

398
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,800
but they take it upon themselves that this great

399
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,400
joy of God's Love must be given to others.

400
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,720
But of course, despite all that, we do have some

401
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,080
funny people in every proof sometimes who are

402
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,800
like dog in the manger,

403
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,840
they don't get their realization nor do they allow others to get it.

404
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,960
It's a - some feeling with very frivolous and flippant people,

405
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,120
who are harmed very badly,

406
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,400
still they don't want to have the blessings of God

407
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,200
and try to create problems for us.

408
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,880
It is a sad thing that it should happen

409
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,880
in a country where there are so many seekers who are already lost.

410
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,760
So many people who are God's own people are lost.

411
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,840
One must have some civil sense in understanding

412
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,800
that those who are lost are the people of God.

413
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,920
As William Blake has said

414
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,640
that the men of God will become prophets,

415
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,880
and those who will become prophets will make other prophets.

416
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,360
This is the first thing that happens to you

417
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,080
that you become a prophet.

418
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,720
In the sense that you become a saint,

419
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,680
in the sense that the energy of God which is all pervading

420
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,720
which is doing all living work starts flowing through you.

421
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,560
And when it starts flowing through you, you can use that power,

422
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,320
not only to correct yourself and improve yourself

423
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,480
but give this, the blessing of peace and bliss to God.

424
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,520
Please be seated properly,

425
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,080
if you can't sit you sit on the chair all right?

426
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,080
Now,

427
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,320
for us it is important to understand that I am here

428
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,920
talking about something that is extremely holy and auspicious.

429
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,440
It has not worked out before.

430
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,880
This is the first time in the history of spirituality,

431
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,520
so many people are taking their realization.

432
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,160
As I said, this is the time of last judgment.

433
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,720
This is the time of resurrection which Mohammed Sahib has described

434
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:10,240
that at that time your hands will be speaking.

435
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,080
How can hands speak?

436
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,320
Anybody can say that, "How can hands speak?"

437
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,480
But the Muslims don't think about it.

438
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,960
They just say, “Let us do namas all the time morning till evening,

439
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,840
do the exercise of namas and we will get realization.”

440
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,880
Christians think that they will get their

441
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,960
realization if they take their baptism.

442
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,760
It's not so.

443
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,920
All these religions were established much before

444
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,560
just to keep you in balance.

445
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,720
To live a life of moderation.

446
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,760
On the contrary human beings have gone to the extremes.

447
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,640
But I must tell you that the Divine is so generous,

448
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,320
is so kind, is working so fast

449
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,480
that despite all these things that you have done to yourself

450
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,400
and to your society,

451
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,040
and as human beings the way you have erred

452
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,320
or whatever you have done, it just forgets and forgives.

453
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,480
Because you are the children of God.

454
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,960
Because He is your Father.

455
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,720
He is the Father who is love,

456
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,360
who is truth, who is joy.

457
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,040
And He is anxious that His children should enter into His kingdom

458
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,400
and enjoy all the blissful thing that He has to give.

459
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,400
Now if you want to see

460
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,960
how you are made, you'll be surprised.

461
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,160
We must have self esteem.

462
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,480
We must understand that God has created us with very great care,

463
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,600
with very great love to become human beings.

464
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,320
And we should not for anything whatsoever,

465
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,280
whosoever it may be, the guru

466
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,120
or the cult or the religion or anything,

467
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,960
should neglect ourselves.

468
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,640
Then you will be responsible for your own neglect

469
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,280
and not God Almighty or any one of these prophets;

470
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,520
they have said that you can be saved.

471
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,400
Now as you see within us lies these subtle centers.

472
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,240
These subtle centers are

473
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,000
the ones which, who represent within us

474
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,760
a different stage of evolution.

475
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,440
First of all if you see the first center, is the Mooladhara.

476
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,560
Now this center is very important

477
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,400
because - for Australians I should say -

478
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:42,160
because in the universe this center is Australia.

479
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,120
Australia is the place

480
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,040
where this center we can consider as manifesting,

481
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,640
the powers of Mooladhara chakra.

482
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:56,160
It is the most powerful center in the whole being.

483
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,520
Because it is the power

484
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,360
of innocence in a human being.

485
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,080
The innocence that is the matter, matter is innocent,

486
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,040
animals are innocent,

487
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,400
because they haven’t developed their ego so far,

488
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,920
neither they have got those conditionings

489
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,880
by which we are supposed to be sinners.

490
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,160
A dog or a horse or a camel,

491
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,600
none of them think that they are sinners.

492
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,160
It's only we think that we are sinners

493
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,440
and we have done something wrong.

494
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,960
The reason for this is that God has given us freedom.

495
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,080
So whatever we have done in that freedom

496
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,040
we feel responsible for it

497
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,000
and we start condemning ourselves as sinners and all those things.

498
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,600
But who feels that he is a sinner is the ego and not the Spirit.

499
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,120
The Spirit does not commit any sin!

500
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,160
Is the purest of pure,

501
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,040
nothing can contaminate it,

502
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,760
nothing can destroy it,

503
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,600
nothing can make it absolutely invisible.

504
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,520
It is all the time there within our heart,

505
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,280
watching what we are doing.

506
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,360
As described in Gita is called as Kshetrajna,

507
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,640
the one who knows the field, who watches the field,

508
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,120
who is the witness of the field, which resides in our heart.

509
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,760
All these things whatever I've said has to happen to us,

510
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,640
otherwise it just becomes our mental activity.

511
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,920
I have nothing to bring in anything that is controversial,

512
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,360
everybody has brought out some sort of a thing

513
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,760
and said that this is this and this is this.

514
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,880
But one must know that once you get

515
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,240
your Self-realization it must work.

516
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,480
That's the point people do not understand,

517
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,520
that if you go to a guru,

518
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,400
did it work out your own powers?

519
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,480
Maybe they might be paying you for doing some work,

520
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,760
doesn't matter, that's another enterprise.

521
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,080
But did it give you the reality?

522
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,920
Did it give your absolute meaning?

523
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,240
It has given you your purpose or not?

524
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,920
Has it finished your seeking or not?

525
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,120
You must ask these questions to yourself and be truthful about it.

526
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,680
If not then you better get it.

527
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,440
Now to say that I am the only person doing this,

528
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,960
is all comes out of these people asking funny questions to you.

529
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,280
Now the thing is, she asked me a question:

530
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,080
“Are you the only person doing it?”

531
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,800
I said, I don't know of any other.

532
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,600
I mean you can twist it the way you like,

533
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,160
but so far I haven't met anyone who is giving mass-realization.

534
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,320
I have not met anyone and if I meet I will be very happy to retire.

535
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,440
Even if the sahaja yogis

536
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,920
who come up to that level can give mass-realization just like that

537
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,800
it would be a nice idea to retire

538
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,880
because now I am going to be 60 years of age

539
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,560
and I think I deserve retirement after the hard work of 14 years.

540
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,000
This one is the first center as I told you,

541
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,120
is this great country of

542
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,640
Ganesha - Australia.

543
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,800
The symbol of this is already expressed

544
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,760
in the place called as Ayers Rock.

545
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,760
Ayers Rock if you go and see

546
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,160
has the symbol which is embodying

547
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,520
the great deity that resides on this.

548
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,320
That has the same colour if you see there

549
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,920
and it has the same deity sitting down there

550
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,040
which is called as Shri Ganesha in the Sanskrit language.

551
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,880
Now this deity, innocent deity

552
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,000
or the one which is representing innocence,

553
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,320
incarnated on this earth

554
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,040
for our sake, for our salvation

555
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,520
as our Lord Jesus Christ.

556
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,600
He incarnated and He is bestowed upon

557
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,880
that center of Agnya which you see there

558
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,920
which is actually the body is made of the sun.

559
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,560
That's why most of the Christians are sun worshippers.

560
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,080
This great personality came on this earth

561
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,400
with a very great work because all others

562
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,720
also you can see, but today I would like to speak about Him.

563
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,320
I was told in Adelaide there are lots of churches.

564
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,240
But every human being is a church of God

565
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,080
and temple of God, in that resides Christ,

566
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,720
at this point which is the gate you can see very clearly,

567
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,760
in that gate He resides

568
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,360
and that is the cross which He has carried,

569
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,240
on which He was crucified,

570
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,920
because this cross was too tight,

571
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,240
and something had to pass through it.

572
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,520
His resurrection is the message to all the Christians

573
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,480
that the way He resurrected

574
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,160
you are going to be resurrected by God Almighty.

575
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,880
He came on this earth,

576
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,760
suffered for you and He died on the cross,

577
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,160
just to give you this special privilege of having this great

578
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,480
Agnya Chakra there which He adores.

579
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,720
This is the Agnya Chakra within us.

580
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,360
Now the mistake lies in one thing

581
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,560
that when we say of baptism, it is not an artificial process.

582
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,320
This is a living process.

583
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,720
Christ could not have talked of something artificial or ritualistic.

584
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,080
What He said, baptism was that the Kundalini should be awakened

585
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,040
and it should penetrate through this fontanel bone area,

586
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,920
and should give you the experience of the Holy Ghost.

587
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,720
Now this what I am saying

588
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,520
is also written in an Indian book about our Lord Jesus Christ,

589
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,760
and we do not read the right books in Sanskrit

590
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,480
because they are not translated.

591
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,040
What we are reading are the so called pseudo people

592
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,640
who came about from 50 years back and try to preach

593
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,000
about Hinduism or some sort of a "ism".

594
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,800
But about Christ nobody told.

595
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,920
When they came from other countries to visit India,

596
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,240
nobody told that He is the Maha Vishnu

597
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,440
because nobody knew about it. They could not relate it.

598
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,400
They could not relate, they could not tell

599
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,680
that He was the incarnation of the Maha Vishnu.

600
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,720
And Maha Vishnu is the one, if you read in the Devi Mahatmayam

601
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,920
everything tallies exactly with a character of Shri Jesus Christ.

602
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,480
If you read it you will be amazed how clearly He is described.

603
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,680
Even it is described that first He was an egg

604
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,560
and out of the egg, half egg was Shri Ganesha

605
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,800
and the half egg became Shri Jesus Christ.

606
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,080
And then, that's why on a Easter day if you know,

607
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,440
we always give eggs, meaning

608
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,760
we human beings are eggs at this time

609
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,200
as human beings, but we have to become the bird.

610
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,440
He came on this earth specially for creating a very special

611
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,240
type of device and an awareness within us.

612
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,720
Because this is the gate as I told you

613
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,200
to the Kingdom of God which is the limbic area within us.

614
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,320
Whatever is in the subtle is in the gross.

615
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,360
So this limbic area was

616
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,200
to be achieved through piercing through one gate that is

617
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,120
our Lord Jesus Christ.

618
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,040
Now how to pierce it was a problem because

619
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,720
if anybody tried to pierce it, he may just

620
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,640
go on the sides and become something else but a superconcious man.

621
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:49,440
So it was Jesus Christ who is the embodiment of

622
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,640
the Ruh, the All Pervading Power, the Chaitanya, the Omkara,

623
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,600
He came on this earth and He did that job for us,

624
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,560
because He resides there.

625
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,960
Now what He said by

626
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,560
the second birth or by baptism was

627
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,800
that this Kundalini which is lying

628
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,200
at the triangular bone there, has to rise.

629
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,640
Rise and penetrate through this center,

630
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,600
awaken Jesus Christ there.

631
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,200
Now the - what great miraculous thing

632
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,160
He has done that once you awaken this center within us,

633
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,800
these two institutions on the left and the right,

634
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,080
one is the ego, another is the super ego;

635
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,640
one is the ego which gives us

636
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:43,320
all ideas about ourselves which are not really self esteem

637
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,120
but something false.

638
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,280
And super ego is the

639
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,400
condition in which we human beings become conditioned,

640
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,720
in which we accept conditions: I am this, I am this, I am this.

641
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,360
Both the things are sucked in by the awakening

642
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,960
of the Kundalini of this great incarnation on this earth.

643
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,560
Once it is sucked in what you find that

644
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,160
on top of your head where you reach

645
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,640
this place, you find that it has become an open space now.

646
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,560
And suddenly you find the Kundalini is rising

647
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,560
and you can feel the breeze of the Holy Ghost.

648
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,400
In the bible about Holy Ghost very little is written,

649
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,400
for that you have go to Indian Scriptures were She is described

650
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:35,200
as the power of God Almighty, as Adi Shakti.

651
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,200
It is not proper to bind yourself like a horse

652
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,920
and see whatever is available but open yourself out

653
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,920
and see the references that are given about the great happening

654
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,120
of the advent of Shri Jesus Christ.

655
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,320
Now what relations He has with Shri Krishna, with Shri Rama

656
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,320
with other deities and other prophets

657
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,440
is to be seen later on. When you come to Sahaja Yoga

658
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,680
gradually you realize that they are all related to each other.

659
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,480
And Christ has openly

660
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,200
said that those who are not against are with Me.

661
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,440
The three people who went to

662
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,160
see Jesus when He was born were Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

663
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,240
Is described, were the three great people

664
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,680
who went to see Jesus He was born was

665
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,680
Shri Krishna as Vishnu

666
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,520
and Mahesha is Shiva,

667
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,920
and Brahma as Brahmadeva.

668
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,520
All these people went to worship.

669
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,520
Nobody knew from where they came,

670
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,720
who they were, they were called as the three wise men.

671
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,960
Now whatever I am saying has to be first experienced,

672
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,960
because if I say something need not be true;

673
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,760
as I would say that it is not essential

674
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,120
that you should believeevery word I say.

675
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,480
On the contrary blind faith is against Sahaja Yoga.

676
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,360
It should happen to you first,

677
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,600
once it happens then you will be amazed

678
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:09,320
that you yourself is a very great

679
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,680
miraculous instrument of God.

680
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,360
You will be amazed, how this instrument works.

681
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,160
Even the people who come to Me, say,

682
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,920
“Mother we are gone cases we are good for nothing,

683
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,800
we led a very bad life we are inauspicious.”

684
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,560
Every sort of thing, I said, "Now

685
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,240
let it be, you don't judge yourself.

686
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,520
Let the Divine judge you, let's see what happens to you.

687
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,360
Why are you after yourself?

688
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,720
Forget it, first of all you did mistakes,

689
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,840
doesn't matter, but now you are using that again to harm yourself.

690
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,760
So please forget all the mistakes, everything that has been done,

691
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,360
all wrong things you think you have done.

692
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,640
Only you get what you have."

693
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,840
I am here just to give that what you have.

694
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,640
Now this great happening takes place

695
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,920
in such a smooth way in people who are normal people.

696
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,320
But not in all people I would say.

697
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,800
Some people do not feel it because they have some abnormalities

698
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,880
in their different centers which are placed within you.

699
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,560
These are the subtle centers expressed outside as gross centers.

700
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,320
They are all the time there,

701
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,720
but the deities within them are not yet enlightened.

702
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,000
They only get enlightened when the Kundalini rises

703
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,480
and pierces through the fontanel bone area.

704
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,640
Now the Spirit resides in the heart.

705
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:35,560
The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty,

706
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,520
and Holy Ghost is the Power of God,

707
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,080
the Shakti of God which manifest everything else.

708
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,240
You'll be amazed how in the gross these things can be seen,

709
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,760
absolutely into the grossest thing.

710
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,840
My son in law is a great photographer

711
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,080
and he was working on Himalaya, ultimately I said you take it

712
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,720
from some old books and find out about it.

713
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,960
So I gave him an idea that you go and see near Manasarovar.

714
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,800
There is a place called Manasarovar

715
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,920
where also you find the Sadashiva is kept,

716
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,320
just like a human face.

717
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,880
Twelve miles of area you can see that it's just a human being,

718
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,000
a face of a human being which is called as Dakshinamurthy,

719
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,920
which is looking towards the south.

720
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,520
And this one is just a - not melted at all,

721
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,080
nothing, is all the time there

722
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,080
and if you see the face there are two other

723
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,440
aspects of Him are shown on His head.

724
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,360
But I told him that in Manasarovar

725
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,120
if you go that is the super ego, Manasa.

726
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,840
Manasa means the emotional mind, you see,

727
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,280
English language is rather funny

728
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,640
but I tell you Manasa means the emotional mind.

729
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,160
There is this emotional mind represented as Manasarovar.

730
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,080
And after that I told him there must be another one.

731
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,240
He said yes there is another one which is called as Rakshastal.

732
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,200
Rakshasa you know, the word Rakshasa means a devil - Rakshastal.

733
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,800
And now that Rakshastal is so turbulent

734
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,880
despite the fact they are close to each other

735
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,480
and between them is placed this Sadhashiva's image,

736
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,880
but this Rakshastal is so turbulent

737
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,040
that one can't believe that the same,

738
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,280
at the same place these two are having a different type of nature.

739
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,560
And those people who went with him could not even touch that

740
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,640
water of that Rakshastal, because it represented the ego,

741
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,000
less they become ego oriented, so they would not touch it.

742
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,040
So this was nothing, you see there are so many things in the gross

743
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,320
you can make it out whatever is described in the old times

744
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,320
is there existing, it is there.

745
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,560
In the same way human beings are in the intermediate state

746
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,360
and if you go even subtler

747
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,720
you'll find all these centers are within you.

748
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,840
Now how can you prove through Kundalini

749
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,560
that what I am saying is true?

750
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,960
That we have to see for oneself because in the West

751
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,720
I have to go on convincing people, convincing people,

752
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,480
pleading them for their realization.

753
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,800
Just for getting realization I have to put all, put forward

754
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,560
all kinds of explanations, all kinds of suggestions

755
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,560
that they should believe that they can get Self-realization.

756
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,400
There are people also who say, “How can you get it so easily?”

757
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,040
But if I say you can, why not try it, what's the harm?

758
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,960
It is so difficult to convince a

759
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,240
mind which is all the time thinking about it,

760
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,960
you can't think about it.

761
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,680
You can't think about a sprouting of the seed, it just works out,

762
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,440
if you put a seed in the mother earth it just works out.

763
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,280
You don't have to think,

764
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,320
if you start thinking about it, will it sprout? It will not.

765
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,720
It is the capacity of the mother earth that does the job.

766
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,720
But that time we take it for granted.

767
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,320
In the same way if I say you can get your Self-realization,

768
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:01,000
people start being doubtful about it.

769
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,040
Another thing is, that it is the other way round,

770
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,120
it is you who has to take something

771
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,880
not that I have to take anything from you.

772
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,560
You cannot give Me anything, it's you who has to benefit by it,

773
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,560
not Me. So why there should be a question

774
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,360
when I am not selling anything,

775
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,120
when I am not acquiring anything out of you,

776
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,960
when there is no possibility of you being exploited

777
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,400
or plundered by Me or used by Me.

778
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,280
Why should you get this doubt in your mind?

779
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,080
Is it also that you feel doubtful about yourself?

780
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,760
But that is to be decided by the Divine and not by you.

781
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,480
So please first of all try to know that you are the Spirit

782
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,520
and that you have to become the Spirit

783
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,640
and that once you become the Spirit

784
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,360
you become collectively conscious.

785
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,480
Today only when I went for this interview for the ABC,

786
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,480
the gentleman was -

787
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,280
of course interviewed Me, when I came out there was a lady.

788
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,320
And I told the lady that you have got liver trouble.

789
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,280
She asked Me, "How do you know, did he tell you?"

790
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,920
I said, "Nobody told Me, but I know because I know."

791
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,680
So that's what happens to you, that you become

792
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,840
collectively conscious, you can feel it on your hands

793
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,960
what's wrong with others and with yourself.

794
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,720
Now when we come to this

795
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,080
point of realization, we have to know

796
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,760
that the problems of this world are due to one fact,

797
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,480
that we have not achieved our absolute.

798
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,080
Some people think by doing alternate work we’ll be happier.

799
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,280
If supposing somebody is a capitalist he’ll become a communist.

800
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,480
Then if he is the communist, he’ll become a socialist.

801
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,720
These are all manufactures of this brain.

802
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,240
But actually if you ask, I'm a

803
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,040
complete capitalist because I have all the powers

804
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,040
and I am a complete communist

805
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,320
because I can’t live without giving it to you.

806
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:03,000
So how the communism and capitalism, which is so artificial outside,

807
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,480
becomes a reality with you, that you become empowered

808
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,000
with your real powers and not unreal powers

809
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,520
because possessions and things are unreal.

810
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,320
They are not real powers,

811
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,760
and once you get these real powers you want to share it with others.

812
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,480
You want to give it to others, you want to work it out for others.

813
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,880
And under these modern circumstances where we think

814
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,200
we are very frustrated and we are unhappy,

815
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,840
that's why we are going to God, is a wrong statement.

816
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,520
You are coming to God because you have been seekers

817
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,400
of ages.

818
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,720
You have been seeking long time back

819
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,960
and this is the time, the fruit of it is coming.

820
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,800
I've met so many children, even in Australia, who are born realized.

821
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,440
Great saints are taking their birth today

822
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,280
just to do this God's work

823
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,760
and you will find that you are one of them who has been seeking.

824
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,720
In Nala Damayanthi Puran, which was written

825
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,160
I think sixteen thousand years back,

826
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,720
it is mentioned that this Nala got very angry with Kali -

827
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,920
Kali is the one who governs this modern times -

828
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,640
and He said, "I am going to kill you,

829
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,160
because you create confusion in the minds of people,

830
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,360
you create complete confusion of values,

831
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,720
and you make them destroy themselves.

832
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,760
So I better destroy you once for all,

833
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,800
so there is no problem for human beings."

834
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
So Kali said, "All right you can destroy Me

835
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,720
but I have some good points,

836
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,480
you must know also the importance of My being there."

837
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,200
He said, "What is your importance?" He said, "The importance is

838
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,600
that when I will come on this earth to rule

839
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,320
that time, these people who are now

840
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,480
wondering in the Himalayas, wondering in the hills

841
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,640
and dales all over the world who are seeking

842
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,240
outside the cities, outside the houses

843
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,560
will find the answer.

844
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,200
They will find the God Almighty.

845
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,040
They will find their Spirit!”

846
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,360
He said it about sixteen thousand years back

847
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,600
and that is today has started.

848
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:10,080
The point where we have to

849
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,160
be really sure is, that this is the time.

850
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,920
Because the signs and symptoms are like that.

851
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,520
You can’t imagine so many people seeking

852
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,320
anywhere in the world,

853
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,840
anytime. When even Christ came

854
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,280
it was so difficult to carry those twelve people with Him.

855
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,120
Nobody was seeking at the time.

856
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,520
He of course gave sermons, He talked about it

857
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,240
that is the last, we can say,

858
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,520
who was such a great Incarnation on this earth,

859
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,200
but nobody listened to Him.

860
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,440
After that Mohammed came. When He lived how people treated Him!

861
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,200
They tried to poison Him, they tried to torture Him

862
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,360
and He had such a miserable life

863
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,360
that the Muslims today when they behave in the same manner,

864
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,720
it is most surprising that whatever He has suffered

865
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,120
the people have to support, suffer at the hands of these Muslims.

866
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,960
There are other also ideas people have got

867
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:04,640
like we must suffer for our emancipation;

868
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,200
or we must cleanse ourselves.

869
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,720
Already somebody has suffered for us.

870
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,360
There is no need for you to suffer and do all these things.

871
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,000
As I said that Jews believed in it and they denied Christ.

872
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,840
Then they suffered, really they suffered,

873
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,760
but after that suffering was there any transformation?

874
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,040
On the contrary they were so embittered

875
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,680
the way they behave while killing these PLO-people,

876
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,120
you will be amazed, the same people who suffered so badly

877
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,520
forgot all that and became such cruel people

878
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,320
and they killed so many people.

879
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,960
So this kind of a suffering doesn't bring

880
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,520
any kind of transformation within you.

881
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,320
Transformation has to take place,

882
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,840
this is the condition of your Self.

883
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,720
If the Self is manifesting,

884
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,440
it is not that you believe in this and I believe in that,

885
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,920
It IS! It's no question of believing, IT IS so!

886
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:03,280
That is what it is, nothing to be believed into blindly

887
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,200
or to be professed into or to accept something,

888
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,440
but it is there within you and that is an absolute truth.

889
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,120
Even if there are ten small children sitting

890
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,360
and they are realized souls

891
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,600
and if you ask them, "What is the condition of this gentleman?"

892
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,600
They will all raise one finger. This means only one thing,

893
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,560
because they can feel it, on their finger something burning,

894
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,840
maybe something numb, maybe something heavy.

895
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,760
All of them, even if you tie their eyes, will say the same thing

896
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,760
because truth is the same.

897
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,480
As all of us are sitting here we know it's night

898
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,840
and that the colour of this thing is greenish or whatever it is.

899
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,720
In the same way, when you get your realization, the feeling,

900
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,960
the awareness comes in your feeling and this feeling

901
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:57,120
tells you exactly where you are and what you have to do.

902
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:02,000
It is a remarkable thing that you are a human being.

903
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,000
Is the greatest work of God,

904
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,000
the greatest creation of God is human being.

905
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,880
Of course you may think they are ugly

906
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,680
and you should have nothing to do with them.

907
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,400
There are some people who just believe that

908
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,760
human beings are the ugliest thing. But they are not!

909
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,840
Only thing, they have not been put to the mains,

910
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,800
this is yoga, is the union with the Divine.

911
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,760
Unless and until an instrument is put to the mains,

912
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,520
to its source, it has no meaning.

913
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,520
In the same way unless and until

914
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,680
you are put to the mains, you will have no meanings.

915
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,840
So the best thing is for you to be convinced

916
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,840
that you have to have your realization

917
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,800
and it can work out in a split of a second and let it work out.

918
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,880
Just work it out is the best for you that anyone can

919
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,080
suggest that you become the Self.

920
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,440
Now about the Self I have talked many a times, I told people

921
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:05,360
that Self is the one that is residing in your heart.

922
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,200
But the seat of the Self is here, the Sadhashiva.

923
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:14,040
He stands here and when the Kundalini rises and touches that,

924
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,360
the seat sends message to the Heart

925
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:23,160
and then the Heart starts feeling throwing those vibrations.

926
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,080
Actually it is not the Spirit that does

927
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:32,240
but it is the Kundalini after enlightenment starts pulsating.

928
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,560
It’s so clear-cut, you can’t imagine,

929
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,120
it is so beautiful, you can’t imagine.

930
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,840
Now the result of this Self-realization -

931
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,200
in this short time I have to cover many points

932
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,200
and that's why I am trying to cover it up -

933
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,960
is first of all you get your physical

934
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,240
fitness. People ask Me, "How could You cure physically?"

935
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,320
If you are doctors here, you will understand

936
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,200
that doctors do not know anything about

937
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,120
parasympathetic nervous system.

938
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,160
That is the expression of the central path

939
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,520
within us called as the Sushumna Nadi.

940
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,200
This parasympathetic nervous system gives us the balance,

941
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,920
the sustenance.

942
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,880
For example, if you are running fast your heartbeat increases.

943
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,640
But it is slowed down

944
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,560
by the action of parasympathetic nervous system.

945
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,280
When the Kundalini is awakened this parasympathetic nervous system

946
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:29,760
becomes evident in our awareness.

947
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:35,040
First time the Spirit starts becoming

948
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,000
one with our attention.

949
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,560
Our attention itself becomes enlightened.

950
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,360
Now when this Kundalini rises,

951
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,600
this parasympathetic nervous system starts manifesting itself

952
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,880
and whatever center is exhausted

953
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,480
by which an imbalance is created within us

954
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,200
in our physical body or in our emotional body

955
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,560
or in our mental body or in our spiritual body,

956
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,680
it starts absolutely

957
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,880
behaving in a manner as if we have reached our total blessings.

958
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,760
It just disappears, it just disappears.

959
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,640
And it is so surprising, that people don't want to believe it

960
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,280
because they have seen a person behaving this manner and that manner

961
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,520
and suddenly next day overnight they find

962
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,760
the person who is an alcoholic becomes a free bird.

963
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,960
They find a drug addict becoming a free bird,

964
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,400
they can’t believe it. It is fantastic!

965
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,960
Everything that God does is fantastic.

966
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,200
All His work we have taken for granted,

967
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,680
at least this living work of God

968
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,120
you can understand that it works within you.

969
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,840
It is beyond all your dogmas,

970
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:48,040
all your philosophies, all your complications.

971
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,960
Because it is unlimited,

972
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,280
while your brain is limited, your intelligence is limited.

973
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,840
And if you want to understand God

974
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,560
you cannot understand It

975
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,120
by this limited thing, which is your brain.

976
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,880
Of course logically you can come to conclusion.

977
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:09,120
You have to come to conclusion logically understanding that

978
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,320
you cannot pay for it, you cannot work it out,

979
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,120
it has to be spontaneous

980
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,400
and you cannot do it yourself.

981
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,760
Everything you can do it yourself,

982
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,920
but realization has to be worked out

983
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,200
by somebody who is an enlightened person.

984
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,800
For example if I work it out for any one of you,

985
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,120
that person can work it out for others.

986
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,760
This is so simple as that and I think

987
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,360
it is high time that we should go in for realization,

988
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,320
we have so many people and I won't be able to attend to you,

989
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,240
if I continue with the speech.

990
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,720
Is it all right for you to have the realization now?

991
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,800
Just open any window here, either air condition or anything.

992
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,400
If you do not treat yourself with respect,

993
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,520
nobody can treat you with respect.

994
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,720
So be respectful about it and try to

995
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,400
get the blessings of realization,

996
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,880
that would be a nice idea.

997
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:10,560
By the way we have now been able to

998
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,520
get some people to work in Adelaide

999
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,840
for you to go further with your realization

1000
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,560
and understanding what it is,

1001
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,840
to learn the technique of it.

1002
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,760
And once you learn the technique

1003
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:30,640
you will find it will help you a lot to help others.

1004
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:36,520
And if you are intelligent enough you can do it very well.

1005
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,440
Will you please all put your hands towards Me

1006
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,720
like this, just like that.

1007
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,560
Those who don't want to do it

1008
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,480
should please go away and leave us alone,

1009
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,520
I would request you those who don't want to do

1010
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,240
meditation should go away

1011
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,280
and don't disturb others because it spoils the vibrations of people,

1012
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,440
so those who don't want to do it please go away.

1013
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,560
You don't want to do it?
Can I ask a question?

1014
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,520
No, no, no question today, I have had enough

1015
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,480
of questions this morning, will you please go.

1016
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,320
No you can write, all right.

1017
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,520
You can write to Me, you see the questions I had too many

1018
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,240
and I want to attend to everyone.

1019
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,680
You remember last time how much I had to work

1020
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,440
and I couldn't attend to everyone.

1021
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,680
So it's better not to attend to anybody's personal questions,

1022
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,920
it's not proper because I want to give attention to you all.

1023
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,160
You see, if you have any questions you may write to Me

1024
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,320
and I'll let you know. Please put your hands towards Me.

1025
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,720
All of you should do it. Those who do not want to do it, again I say

1026
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,960
please be civil and kind

1027
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:37,640
and go away as proper people, and don't try to disturb us.

1028
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,360
Please put your hands towards Us.

1029
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,200
You may write your questions

1030
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,240
and come and see Me tomorrow morning, all right?

1031
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,880
If you have any questions, I'll give you special time.

1032
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,760
You have also questions? All right,

1033
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,000
so can you go out now and write down.

1034
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,480
Why not? You cannot force yourself to be here,

1035
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,480
it is very wrong. You want to force.

1036
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,560
Why?

1037
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,120
No that's not I am not going to waste any time with you, but

1038
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,880
is very unkind of you to force us like that.

1039
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,560
We never come to your meetings, why should you come to our meeting

1040
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,040
and disturb us? It's not proper.

1041
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,760
It's all right, forget it now!

1042
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,800
We have, I have nothing to talk, no no it's all right,

1043
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,880
don't disturb us, please, please will you behave yourself, or ask him to get out.

1044
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:22,520
"Why do you call yourself God?”

1045
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,680
All right, forget it just now,

1046
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,360
you are God is it? What good have you done to anyone

1047
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,120
that you are here to object Me?

1048
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,760
Have you done any good to anyone so far? Not even to yourself.

1049
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,760
Then, why don’t you allow Me to do good to others?

1050
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,640
All right. Now don't talk!

1051
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,880
Keep your hands like this.

1052
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,400
I could see the way he is,

1053
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,560
I could see that, immediately I pointed out,

1054
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,720
you see among all. All right keep yourself shut!

1055
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,880
You only know how to talk, you have a big mouth,

1056
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,040
that’s all, nothing more.

1057
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:58,320
Please close your eyes.

1058
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:02,280
Please close your eyes.

1059
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,040
With both hands towards Me,

1060
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,240
you just close your eyes and don't worry about others,

1061
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,520
just think of yourself just now

1062
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,880
that you have to have this experience.

1063
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,760
So many people had experience in the last meeting

1064
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,720
and you all should have it.

1065
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,840
Even if you are thinking it does not matter.

1066
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:51,320
Let loose your attention, don't put any pressure on your attention.

1067
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:55,600
Just let loose your attention.

1068
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,760
Now as I told you the left hand

1069
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,760
is the power of your desire.

1070
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,640
And the right side is the power of your action.

1071
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:53,120
So with your left hand on your lap in a very relaxed manner

1072
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:58,920
you raise your right hand to your heart, to your heart

1073
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:11,840
and ask a question within yourself, not loudly,

1074
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:16,440
'Mother am I the Spirit?'

1075
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:28,520
Just put your hand right on your heart.

1076
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,640
Left hand towards Me, left hand towards Me, just ask a question,

1077
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:40,200
'Mother am I the Spirit?'

1078
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:49,400
Now put this right hand on your stomach on the left hand side

1079
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,720
which is the center of your

1080
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,840
guru, the primordial master.

1081
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:00,320
As you are the master of yourself,

1082
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:05,600
you just say, 'Mother, I am the master.'

1083
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,280
'Am I the master?' we asked the other day,

1084
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:13,440
today you say, 'Mother, I am my own guru , I am my own master.’

1085
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:17,480
With full confidence you should say.

1086
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,360
You should understand it fully within yourself

1087
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,800
that unless and until you become a master,

1088
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,560
you cannot make out who is true, who is not true.

1089
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,440
You cannot make it out! So first of all you become the master.

1090
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,080
Put your right hand

1091
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:46,520
on your stomach on the left hand side and ask a question,

1092
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,920
if you have come today for the first time.

1093
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,160
But those who've got realization

1094
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:57,480
the other day must say, ’Mother, I am the master.

1095
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,160
I am the guru.'

1096
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:09,760
You don't need any guru because your Spirit is the guru.

1097
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:14,880
Your Spirit is the guru! Just awaken your Spirit.

1098
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:31,360
Now again raise your hand higher on the heart

1099
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,280
and say,

1100
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:42,440
'Mother, I am the Spirit.’  Just say that.

1101
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,920
Now put this right hand

1102
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:18,400
on the left side of your neck

1103
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,720
which is another center of Vishuddhi.

1104
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:28,800
You are yourself raising your own Kundalini.

1105
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,080
At this center you have to say, 'Mother, I am not guilty.'

1106
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,960
Say it again, not to feel guilty for anything

1107
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,080
that you think you have done wrong.

1108
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,400
Just say, 'Mother, I 'm not guilty.'

1109
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,480
Because the instrument that you are

1110
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,680
has to be cured by the Divine.

1111
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:13,800
Because you have to do God's work. This is God's work!

1112
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:18,280
Unless and until you feel

1113
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:23,240
completely relieved of your guilt,

1114
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:28,360
how can you work out God's things?

1115
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:46,080
If you have said mantras or something in unauthorised way,

1116
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,680
also you develop this trouble on the left side

1117
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,480
which is a very dangerous thing to develop

1118
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,920
and thus you develop a heart trouble

1119
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:59,520
and can be at a very early age,

1120
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,360
you might suffer from a heart trouble.

1121
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:08,600
So better say, 'Mother, I'm not guilty.’ If you are the Spirit

1122
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,240
then how can you be guilty?

1123
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:15,320
There is another danger that lies while saying all these mantras

1124
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,320
that one can develop diseases like cancer,

1125
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:25,200
osteomalayetie and all these by saying wrong mantras,

1126
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,400
guided by some wrong gurus.

1127
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,760
So if you have done anything like that

1128
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:36,320
you have to say, 'Mother, I'm not guilty.’

1129
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:45,480
It can have very serious effects, very serious effects,

1130
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:54,480
specially the muscular part can be absolutely

1131
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:58,400
paralysed on the left side.

1132
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:11,080
Now put your right hand across the forehead

1133
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:18,160
and say,

1134
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,760
'Mother, I forgive everyone.’

1135
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,040
This you have to say with full heart and full understanding

1136
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,920
because the other day, you remember

1137
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,520
that when you said it, immediately you got your realization.

1138
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:35,480
Before that it was all blocked up in the blockage.

1139
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,400
You have to forgive, forgive others,

1140
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,840
forgive others! If you have self esteem

1141
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,960
then you will respect others also, otherwise you cannot have respect.

1142
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,120
If you do not respect yourself, you cannot respect others.

1143
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,400
The first thing is you must say, 'I forgive everyone.’

1144
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,480
Not to get upset by what has happened

1145
01:10:55,680 --> 01:11:01,880
or what somebody does to you, but just to say, 'I forgive everyone.’

1146
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,880
Some people say it is difficult to forgive

1147
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:10,400
but I think it is a myth.

1148
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:15,640
Because when you forgive what do you do? You just

1149
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,920
are forgiving yourself

1150
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,520
because you are not anymore suffering

1151
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,560
from the embitterment from others.

1152
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:29,440
Now put the same hand on top of your head.

1153
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,560
First on top of your Sahasrara.

1154
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,920
Now you have to see, it has to work, it has to work out,

1155
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,640
it's not just talking, but it has to work out.

1156
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,280
Now see for yourself,

1157
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,760
raise your hand a little higher.

1158
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,360
At this stage you have to ask for realization,

1159
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,720
because I cannot cross your freedom.

1160
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:05,200
So say, 'Mother, please give us realization" at this point.

1161
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,160
just put your hand

1162
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:13,040
parallel to your fontanel bone area.

1163
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,480
Now put the other hand and see

1164
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:19,200
if there is a cool breeze coming out.

1165
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:23,000
Put your right hand towards Me,

1166
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,080
just put your right hand towards Me,

1167
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:30,560
whether you are sick or anything, you just work it out.

1168
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,560
It's there, yes.

1169
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,880
You have to convince yourself.

1170
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:44,920
Nobody can convince you, it is you who has to convince yourself.

1171
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,640
You have to feel it yourself.

1172
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,960
If you are not feeling it, then there is something wrong with you.

1173
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,200
Doesn't matter, we'll work it, it should, it should work out.

1174
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,120
If you are not feeling it then is not correct.

1175
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:00,960
Now you can also change again the hand and say that -

1176
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,040
find for yourself,

1177
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,240
and ask a question, 'Is this the

1178
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,800
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?' Ask a question.

1179
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,920
Now rapport is established, just see for yourself.

1180
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,160
See now how you are feeling cooler with the same

1181
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:29,200
thing, is because you have become yourself an air conditioner.

1182
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,080
That's why you all are feeling cooler

1183
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,600
otherwise you all are feeling so hot.

1184
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:38,280
Where is that heat gone now? Just see the proof.

1185
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:43,200
If there is too much heat that means you are either

1186
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:49,160
a liver patient or some disease there which is to be attended.

1187
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,240
See for yourself.

1188
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,280
If you, even if you are paid by some guru,

1189
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,080
better get your realization

1190
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,200
because they can give you only money,

1191
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,640
which you can't take with you. Better take your realization,

1192
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,120
to be wise and sensible, be good children.

1193
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:18,560
Take your realization! This is the chance of lives!

1194
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,360
Now put your both the hands like that

1195
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,280
and ask a question in your heart,'Is this the

1196
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:41,360
breeze of the Holy Ghost we are feeling?'

1197
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:48,520
You will start feeling the cool breeze in your hands,

1198
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:53,160
the sensation crawling down your hands.

1199
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:57,640
All right? Now put your hands towards Me.

1200
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,000
I'll also teach you how to give realization.

1201
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:05,240
I'll try to teach you how to give yourself a realization

1202
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:09,520
which is a very simple method of maintaining your realization.

1203
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,440
Apart from that

1204
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,040
there are going to be some sahaja yogis here

1205
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:18,640
who are going to help you to progress further.

1206
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,280
This hand is to be placed in front of your

1207
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,640
Kundalini like this, this is the

1208
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,880
fixed hand, you can say the fixed movement,

1209
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:34,920
and this right hand is to be taken round like this.

1210
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:39,120
higher in front and down. Everything should be intelligible,

1211
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:42,320
you should understand why we do it. You see clockwise method

1212
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,120
is better to raise the Kundalini. Now do it,

1213
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,880
it's not just to tell some

1214
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,040
mantras to someone and you jump like a frog,

1215
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:53,400
it's really, it should happen in a way that is happening.

1216
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,160
Now put your hands like that. Now take it down.

1217
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:01,560
Again we have to give a knot up there,

1218
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:06,120
it's the raising of the Kundalini. Let's do again.

1219
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,360
The truth is so abounding, that you deny it is dishonesty,

1220
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,480
is dishonesty, complete dishonesty!

1221
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:17,920
Now take it up, one more. Now weave it up.

1222
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:29,640
Do it one more, now thrice you have to do it, one,

1223
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,000
two,

1224
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:37,240
three. Now see for yourself.

1225
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,560
All right?

1226
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,320
You feel very peaceful.

01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,360
The other day I had a lady who came quite stunned,

1228
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:54,080
she could not believe that she is so much changed

1229
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,920
and she said, “I have become a free person now.”

1230
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:01,080
All right? Good.

1231
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:05,200
So thank you very much and if you have any other problem

1232
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,320
of some disease or anything

1233
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,040
you can come and see Me now.
