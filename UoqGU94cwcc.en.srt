1
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,000
in this

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,000
108 names if you have noticed

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,320
they have shown that

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,359
kartikeya is the innocence

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,960
that is acting on the right hand side

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:37,440
in the pingala and that is

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:41,120
also it is very much related to prana

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,239
it gives you prana prana is the vital

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,559
breath that we take

10
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,879
breathe in and breathe out so it is

11
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,280
related to the right side

12
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,719
then also it is related to eternity

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,840
anantari

14
00:00:52,719 --> 00:01:01,680
ananta is the snake or the

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,600
which is the brother of vishnu

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,040
so it is he who is represented here

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,640
as kartikey he is called as ananta

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:17,200
so he is the fire

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:21,680
he is the one who ignites within you

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:25,680
the capacity to consume the force

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,720
also the capacity to command

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,200
the people and

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:37,040
also the capacity to be

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,840
a person full of brilliance

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,520
you see an innocent person could be very

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,759
brilliant

27
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,640
all these capacities are expressed in

28
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,000
karthikeya's

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,880
swarupa in his state

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,399
today by parship worshipping karthikeya

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,439
we have to know

32
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:03,119
that kartikeya is now awakened within us

33
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,920
and with that capacity

34
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,960
we have to fight ultimately he is the

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,479
nishkalanka

36
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,760
he's the one who's the final so

37
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:17,680
from ganesha to christ to nishkalanka

38
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,800
these are the three stages into which

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,120
the innocence has gone from ganesha

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
to karthikeya and now

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,680
to christ and from christ

42
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,920
to nishkalaka in the form of nishkalanka

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,959
he is innocent so he there's no kalanka

44
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,640
there's no

45
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,080
spot on him nothing he's absolutely

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,000
clean immaculate

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,599
plus he's fiery

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,640
plus he has all the qualities of

49
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:54,160
means the 11 qualities or the forces

50
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,200
of shiva which can kill

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,640
so he has a capacity to kill

52
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,840
and destroy that is evil

53
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,920
and to give blessings

54
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,920
and courage to his followers

55
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,159
this is the last incarnation which is

56
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,239
called as kalaki

57
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,720
in normal words you call it kalaki is

58
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,720
actually

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,040
in the white house so it is the

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,640
kartikeya

61
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,080
who sits on the white horse so how

62
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,360
innocence grows within you now is

63
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,879
up to the point of karthikeya

64
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,760
this has been today done on this land

65
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,720
jewish land as you call it where

66
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,640
karthikeya

67
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,920
is to be born within you to be awakened

68
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,000
within you

69
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,000
may god bless you
