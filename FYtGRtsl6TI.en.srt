00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:04,950
Birthday Felicitation
Delhi, India, March 22, 2000

2
00:55:07,476 --> 00:55:20,855
Our honored guest, our respected Home Affairs Ministry is here,

3
00:55:21,466 --> 00:55:28,843
Mr. Advani, who has been always a very great Deshbhakt.

4
00:55:29,073 --> 00:55:34,902
 I admired him because he loved his country; he is very patriotic.

5
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:38,093
And this is ...

6
00:55:53,678 --> 00:56:01,517
And as you know, My father and mother both were very patriotic.

7
00:56:01,742 --> 00:56:05,182
They sacrificed everything for the country,

8
00:56:05,332 --> 00:56:12,696
 and I also was always condemned by everyone
as being a very patriotic person.

9
00:56:21,146 --> 00:56:25,591
We must love the country in which we are born.

10
00:56:25,766 --> 00:56:33,065
There is some connection, very great connection,
 between yourself and your country.

11
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:37,958
And I have seen that after Sahaja Yoga, all those

12
00:56:38,123 --> 00:56:43,832
who have been transformed into new visions and new ideas

13
00:56:43,919 --> 00:56:50,465
always know what’s wrong in their own country,
and so conscious of it.

14
00:56:50,743 --> 00:56:56,130
 I am surprised that every one of them have been able to tell Me

15
00:56:56,233 --> 00:57:00,213
 what’s wrong in their country and what should be done.

16
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:08,119
They never identified with the wrongs
or the misdeeds of their country.

17
00:57:08,222 --> 00:57:10,046
It’s very surprising.

18
00:57:10,237 --> 00:57:14,573
On the contrary they said, “Mother, all these countries

19
00:57:14,669 --> 00:57:18,716
require Your attention so that they should be corrected.”

20
00:57:18,814 --> 00:57:21,325
 Their politicians should be corrected.

21
00:57:21,428 --> 00:57:24,031
Their citizens should be corrected

22
00:57:24,142 --> 00:57:33,930
and that people should really evolve
into a new consciousness.

23
00:57:34,426 --> 00:57:37,342
All of them have been working it out.

24
00:57:37,493 --> 00:57:41,779
Now we have here very few Sahaja Yogis from abroad,

25
00:57:41,947 --> 00:57:46,318
but I tell you it’s surprising how these Sahaja Yogis

26
00:57:46,414 --> 00:57:52,875
have enlightened thousands and thousands
of Sahaja Yogis all over the world.

27
00:57:53,076 --> 00:57:57,178
 They are the ones who are working.
I am not working like them.

28
00:57:57,282 --> 00:58:04,956
 They work very hard. You can see the way
we have got these felicitations from all these people,

29
00:58:05,163 --> 00:58:11,479
 all because they approach these people,
told them all about Sahaja Yoga,

30
00:58:11,504 --> 00:58:14,342
they might have even given them realization.

31
00:58:14,429 --> 00:58:17,508
And that’s how they have worked it out.

32
00:58:17,545 --> 00:58:23,357
So we have to worry about our own country
and its own problems.

33
00:58:23,421 --> 00:58:25,608
 Why these problems are there?

34
00:58:25,704 --> 00:58:30,971
 And I tell you, your wishes and your efforts

35
00:58:31,027 --> 00:58:36,473
will definitely improve  the conditions of your own countries.

36
00:58:36,782 --> 00:58:42,312
 And it’s happening in everywhere, also should happen in India.

37
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:52,570
Once we are realized souls, it is our most important duty is,

38
00:58:52,629 --> 00:59:01,652
 first of all, look after your own societies,
 look after your own country.

39
00:59:01,882 --> 00:59:07,172
If you can’t do that, what’s the use of getting Self-realization?

40
00:59:07,379 --> 00:59:13,053
 Because Self-realization stands on one power -
and the power of love.

41
00:59:13,172 --> 00:59:17,923
And one art - art of selfless love.

42
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:22,737
 If that is there, immediately you start seeing the people

43
00:59:22,824 --> 00:59:26,607
who are surrounding you, who are in your village,

44
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:33,432
who are also in the neighborhood,

45
00:59:33,631 --> 00:59:38,947
or also who are in your city and in your country.

46
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:47,853
Immediately you start understanding what’s the problem,
even your own society.

47
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:50,944
 I have seen, after coming to Sahaja Yoga

48
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,706
 people have tried to improve so many things in their own society.

49
00:59:56,578 --> 01:00:01,488
Now we have many Hindus, many Muslims,

50
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:06,532
Christians, all kinds of people, but I was amazed at one thing.

51
01:00:06,611 --> 01:00:16,171
 Once they got realization, they never identified
with the wrong things of their society or of their religions.

52
01:00:16,301 --> 01:00:20,492
On the contrary they wanted to improve it and work it out.

53
01:00:20,653 --> 01:00:23,839
But there’s a very simple way of doing it.

54
01:00:24,307 --> 01:00:29,301
You don’t have to go out of the way to change people or to

55
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:34,205
 make any sacrifices, nothing of the kind.

56
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:39,645
Everybody today is suffering from some sort of anxiety,

57
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:45,510
some sort of problems, some sort of worries.

58
01:00:45,606 --> 01:00:49,657
Also they are suffering from other problems.

59
01:00:49,895 --> 01:00:57,292
Now if you can tell them that,
 “you can be transformed, you can be transformed.”

60
01:00:57,499 --> 01:01:07,787
 Transformed into a being which is absolutely
above all these worries, above all these problems.

61
01:01:07,961 --> 01:01:10,823
 How can that be? One can ask.

62
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:15,629
Actually what happens that when you get your Self-realization,

63
01:01:15,812 --> 01:01:23,177
your attention gets enlightened by the Self, means the Spirit,

64
01:01:23,287 --> 01:01:28,445
and automatically you start dropping your destructive habits,

65
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:33,608
destructive thoughts and destructive activities.

66
01:01:33,826 --> 01:01:36,780
You suddenly become so constructive.

67
01:01:36,891 --> 01:01:41,792
Now I’ll tell you one thing, I was amazed
when I was in Togliatti in Russia,

68
01:01:41,887 --> 01:01:48,116
a news came to Me that the head of the mafia has become Sahaja Yogi.

69
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:54,975
 I was…I was so touched by it.

70
01:01:55,143 --> 01:02:00,352
And he came to Me and he said, “I was doing all nonsensical things.

71
01:02:00,456 --> 01:02:05,437
 I never got any satisfaction, no joy. But this is something.

72
01:02:05,508 --> 01:02:10,234
 I really can feel the joy and satisfaction within myself.

73
01:02:10,272 --> 01:02:13,875
Mother, whatever was my past, will You forgive me?”

74
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:20,917
I said, “Forgiven.

75
01:02:21,398 --> 01:02:26,546
What is important is the present,
and now you have become a Sahaja Yogi.

76
01:02:26,648 --> 01:02:33,681
 It’s such a credit to your spiritual growth
 the way you have achieved it.”

77
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:40,544
 He said, “Now, I have that peace.
 I have that joy and I want to share it with others.

78
01:02:41,364 --> 01:02:45,512
I could never share my money with others.
 I used to grab money from others.”

79
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:49,008
I said, “I don’t want to have any confessions. Finished!

80
01:02:49,096 --> 01:02:53,895
Now, as you have become a Sahaja Yogi what will you do?”

81
01:02:54,739 --> 01:02:56,533
Surprisingly, he was very sweet.

82
01:02:56,607 --> 01:03:00,004
 He said, “I will send some onions to India.”

83
01:03:00,034 --> 01:03:01,307
I said, “Why?”

84
01:03:01,337 --> 01:03:04,817
He said, “Because there is a problem about onions.”

85
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:10,998
I thought, “look at this man –
how genuine he has become, how humane.”

86
01:03:11,303 --> 01:03:14,265
 I said, “We have no such problem. You don’t worry.”

87
01:03:14,344 --> 01:03:21,334
And then you see his way of looking at things
and working out things was so tremendous

88
01:03:21,414 --> 01:03:25,572
that the same fellow who was a big mafia leader

89
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:32,086
is become such a big, great, honorable person in that area.

90
01:03:33,047 --> 01:03:38,980
 And then he wanted to be elected to the municipal some elections.

91
01:03:39,028 --> 01:03:43,780
I said, “Go ahead. You’ll be elected.
 If you are not elected, doesn’t matter.”

92
01:03:43,816 --> 01:03:46,162
But he got elected also.

93
01:03:46,349 --> 01:03:53,349
So you see how things work out for a person
who wants to be the Spirit.

94
01:03:54,131 --> 01:03:57,008
 Shivaji has said “Swadharma Jagwawa”.

95
01:03:57,071 --> 01:04:01,931
This is the only message he gave for the future.
 “Swadharma Jagwawa” –

96
01:04:02,026 --> 01:04:06,319
 “Swa” means the Spirit. You awaken your Spirit.

97
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:09,458
 That is what we have to achieve.

98
01:04:09,585 --> 01:04:12,137
 Because he himself was a realized soul,

99
01:04:12,273 --> 01:04:18,633
so he said, “this is what you have to do,
 is to make your Spirit awaken.”

100
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:25,861
Now with that light of the Spirit what happens?

101
01:04:26,784 --> 01:04:33,314
 You just see clearly, very clearly, you see what’s wrong with you,

102
01:04:33,473 --> 01:04:36,804
what’s wrong with your society, what’s wrong in your country.

103
01:04:36,854 --> 01:04:43,854
Everything you see very clearly,
and you also have power to correct it.

104
01:04:44,741 --> 01:04:50,708
 If you are aware of your power
and if you have mastered it, you can do it.

105
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:57,466
 You can do it not only for yourself, but for your family,
for your society, for everyone.

106
01:04:58,466 --> 01:05:01,269
My husband always used to say,  “You are a Socialist

107
01:05:01,459 --> 01:05:04,318
 because You can’t exist Yourself alone.

108
01:05:04,381 --> 01:05:09,203
 You must share with others. You are so collective.”

109
01:05:09,545 --> 01:05:14,547
But the thing is, you see, we have to understand
we are a collective.

110
01:05:15,459 --> 01:05:18,016
We cannot exist alone anywhere,

111
01:05:18,174 --> 01:05:21,605
we are all collective. We are not aware of it.

112
01:05:21,724 --> 01:05:25,428
But when you become aware of it, you are so surprised

113
01:05:25,524 --> 01:05:29,104
 that you are part and parcel of the whole.

114
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:36,986
That you don’t have to look for company
 in your own society, in your own samaj. Nothing.

115
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:43,899
 What you want is just to have the company of all the Sahaja Yogis,

116
01:05:44,137 --> 01:05:51,907
 and this has proved beyond doubt
that if you are spiritually awakened,

117
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:58,795
 you have no quarrels with each other, no hatred, no competition.

118
01:05:58,914 --> 01:06:02,322
 I have not seen anybody doing that in Sahaja Yoga.

119
01:06:02,433 --> 01:06:10,135
And that is how things have become so much better
 for all of you together and also outside.

120
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:17,045
One of the ambassadors,
she told Me that, “Mother, we are very happy.”

121
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:18,040
I said, “Why?”

122
01:06:18,084 --> 01:06:22,143
“Because we are not competitive.
So everybody is happy with us.”

123
01:06:22,363 --> 01:06:28,619
This is what it is: that you realize
 that you don’t have to worry about

124
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:33,959
getting something higher position, getting into something very rich,

125
01:06:34,038 --> 01:06:37,517
you can say properties. No!

126
01:06:37,658 --> 01:06:41,738
Because the satisfaction part is within you.

127
01:06:42,374 --> 01:06:47,609
You are so satisfied within yourself that you don’t run after things.

128
01:06:47,766 --> 01:06:52,391
 Like the economics, the modern economics, as it is,

129
01:06:52,617 --> 01:07:01,947
 it is based on one simple factor
 that human beings are never satisfied.

130
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:05,096
 Today they want something, they’ll

131
01:07:05,405 --> 01:07:10,696
run for it and do every sort of thing and make money, get it.

132
01:07:10,966 --> 01:07:13,770
Then they are not satisfied.
They want to have something else.

133
01:07:13,865 --> 01:07:16,506
And then they want to have something else.

134
01:07:16,602 --> 01:07:21,763
This is the basis of economics - I mean, modern economics.

135
01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:24,480
 But Sahaja Yoga is different.

136
01:07:24,735 --> 01:07:29,486
Sahaja Yoga economics is this thing: that I have got realization.

137
01:07:29,605 --> 01:07:33,813
All right! I must share with others.

138
01:07:33,963 --> 01:07:37,843
 If I have got the satisfaction I must share with others.

139
01:07:37,978 --> 01:07:45,651
The sharing part is so important in Sahaja Yoga,
and which people are doing with such beauty.

140
01:07:45,952 --> 01:07:51,572
 As I told you the other day that
we have to learn the art of loving.

141
01:07:51,755 --> 01:07:56,760
 It’s very simple if you know how to say few sweet things,

142
01:07:56,879 --> 01:08:04,154
how to give something sweetly,
how to share with others very sweetly.

143
01:08:04,749 --> 01:08:12,323
It is not difficult for you at all because
you have got your Spirit to give you the joy.

144
01:08:12,497 --> 01:08:17,445
 I know Sahaja Yoga has done wonders.
People have given up drugs overnight.

145
01:08:17,521 --> 01:08:20,819
Now in America they have a proposal for us

146
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:25,347
that we should start a drug addiction things

147
01:08:25,372 --> 01:08:29,826
- to remove the drug addiction - some sort of a organization and all that.

148
01:08:30,525 --> 01:08:34,253
And Sahaja Yogis said that, “We have one million dollar.

149
01:08:34,325 --> 01:08:36,114
Can we do with that?” “No, No!”

150
01:08:36,139 --> 01:08:38,598
they said,  “We’ll give you twenty-one million dollars.”

151
01:08:38,623 --> 01:08:41,674
“What will you do with twenty-one million dollars?” I said.

152
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,662
 “If you want to build something for the drug addiction,

153
01:08:44,686 --> 01:08:47,019
you only need them to come there.

154
01:08:47,082 --> 01:08:49,287
 Overnight, they will give up their drugs.

155
01:08:49,312 --> 01:08:52,969
I have seen that and there are some sitting here.”

156
01:09:01,195 --> 01:09:04,313
Such a power your Spirit has!

157
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:08,845
Such a beauty it has, and such love and peace it has!

158
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:14,732
 Only it is to be brought into your attention
which is going hither, thither, thither.

159
01:09:14,915 --> 01:09:20,533
 Only if your attention is enlightened by the Spirit,

160
01:09:20,628 --> 01:09:23,898
you become such a wonderful person.

161
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:29,915
 All these things as they had described in Sanskrit –
the Kaam, Krodha, Mada, Matsa, Lobha, Moha –

162
01:09:30,011 --> 01:09:32,928
 all of them drop by themselves.

163
01:09:33,016 --> 01:09:37,016
All the anger, all the stupid things we do,

164
01:09:37,068 --> 01:09:41,290
 and all the aggressive things we do, drops out.

165
01:09:41,722 --> 01:09:48,067
I have asked some Sahaja Yogis to go to Kashmir
and make them Sahaja Yogis.

166
01:09:48,332 --> 01:09:51,532
 If you can make them Sahaja Yogis this problem will be over.

167
01:09:51,698 --> 01:09:54,831
 And there are some willing to go there.

168
01:09:55,845 --> 01:09:58,806
Some foreign Sahaja Yogis specially have offered

169
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:02,639
their services to go and change the people’s mind.

170
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:05,814
 Now we have! We have changed people,

171
01:10:05,846 --> 01:10:12,682
 like we have now in a place called Benin, there are seven hundred -

172
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:20,013
 seven thousand - Muslims
who were very fundamentalist,

173
01:10:20,134 --> 01:10:22,604
they all have become Sahaja Yogis.

174
01:10:25,084 --> 01:10:30,295
In Turkey, we have already two thousand Sahaja Yogis. In Turkey!

175
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:34,435
 So even fanaticism of any kind - among Hindus or

176
01:10:34,538 --> 01:10:39,442
among Muslims, among Christians - can be easily changed because

177
01:10:39,467 --> 01:10:44,810
they will see the beauty of their Spirit,

178
01:10:45,218 --> 01:10:49,981
and their religion itself will get enlightened.

179
01:10:50,635 --> 01:10:55,862
They will see the beauty of their religion.
They will see the oneness of all these religions,

180
01:10:55,955 --> 01:11:04,305
and like that a global religion can be accepted
 where all religions will be understood properly.

181
01:11:04,448 --> 01:11:09,472
There have been deviations in every religion and that’s why there’s a problem.

182
01:11:09,546 --> 01:11:14,256
Can you fight in the name of religion when there is only one God?

183
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:18,441
They do because they are ignorant. I don’t blame them.

184
01:11:18,592 --> 01:11:21,290
They have no light. But once they have the light,

185
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:26,932
they will understand what is the global nature of religion.

186
01:11:27,214 --> 01:11:32,815
Now, you’ll be surprised that Sahaja Yoga -
or we can call the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma -

187
01:11:32,929 --> 01:11:39,929
has been accepted in Russia as a religious identity.

188
01:11:49,633 --> 01:11:53,789
But it is not religion like other religions are.

189
01:11:54,642 --> 01:11:57,724
 It is not at all of that kind.

190
01:11:57,994 --> 01:12:03,601
It’s a religion where only we believe in compassion,  love

191
01:12:03,807 --> 01:12:09,480
and also in our own power that nobody can touch you.

192
01:12:09,583 --> 01:12:12,223
 Nobody can kill you.

193
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:18,641
You will be amazed that there was
such a big earthquake in Turkey

194
01:12:18,871 --> 01:12:23,076
 but Sahaja Yogis, none of them were touched.

195
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:29,145
Even their houses were completely all right when the rest was all destroyed.

196
01:12:34,357 --> 01:12:38,810
 So many places, so many places it has happened.

197
01:12:39,112 --> 01:12:41,596
We had hurricane there - the same thing.

198
01:12:41,684 --> 01:12:44,501
 All over, they are sending Me reports, “Mother,

199
01:12:44,613 --> 01:12:47,959
how all the Sahaja Yogis are saved.”

200
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:50,995
How they are perfectly all right!

201
01:12:51,091 --> 01:12:54,130
Because youare protected by the Divine power!

202
01:12:54,248 --> 01:13:00,192
 We have to believe in the Divine power,
which all the religions have believed.

203
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:07,088
 Then the problem comes whether
you should believe in the form or formless.

204
01:13:07,357 --> 01:13:13,158
 Then you will realize that with the formless
only you can understand the form.

205
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:19,403
Very simple thing it is to look at,
but it is really extremely surprising.

206
01:13:19,627 --> 01:13:28,928
For example, once I said that Mecca is
Meccashwara Shiva written down in our books.

207
01:13:28,998 --> 01:13:31,386
But I didn’t know that I just said it.

208
01:13:31,442 --> 01:13:37,556
Now I read an article that they were all worshippers of Shiva.

209
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:45,605
And this is something surprising that
Mohammad Sahib never talked about any religion.

210
01:13:45,676 --> 01:13:51,182
Nobody has read even that, we can say, the Koran.
Nobody has read.

211
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:55,456
We have a very good book written on Koran,
 which of course I guided,

212
01:13:55,551 --> 01:14:00,356
 and it’s so clearly saying what Mohammad Sahib has said.

213
01:14:00,459 --> 01:14:02,896
I mean also this brings discredit to people.

214
01:14:03,046 --> 01:14:06,599
Christ never said things which Christians are saying.

215
01:14:06,671 --> 01:14:08,234
Same with the Hindus.

216
01:14:08,315 --> 01:14:14,128
They are doing things which was never,
 never written in any shastra.

217
01:14:14,664 --> 01:14:20,483
 Very surprising that these people who are in charge of religion

218
01:14:20,555 --> 01:14:27,102
 they are the ones who are spoiling the image
of religions and creating this problem.

219
01:14:27,197 --> 01:14:31,465
 I don’t know why they want to do it.
 What is the use?

220
01:14:31,812 --> 01:14:40,314
Now, regarding…regarding Sakaar and Nirakaar
 it’s very simple to be understood.

221
01:14:40,485 --> 01:14:51,185
After getting realization you can feel the Spund,
you can call it – or vibratory awareness is there.

222
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:57,284
 With that you can feel what is truth what is not.

223
01:14:57,443 --> 01:15:05,914
Now I would say that there is no truth in worshipping a statue

224
01:15:05,939 --> 01:15:12,559
 which is created by a drunkard or a person
who is using it for money.

225
01:15:12,639 --> 01:15:20,004
 But even in the Bible it is said that
whatever created by the sky

226
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:24,447
or by the Mother Earth should not be disrespected.

227
01:15:24,702 --> 01:15:27,276
This is what we call as the Swyambhu.

228
01:15:27,411 --> 01:15:36,505
 But Swyambhus for people who are not realized souls
 is just a sort of a ritual, a karmakand.

229
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:43,284
It’s just a karmakand. They don’t understand
 whether this, whatever is a Swyambhu or not.

230
01:15:43,514 --> 01:15:48,889
Now, you being Sahaja Yogis,
you have seen what I have told you that “go and see

231
01:15:48,945 --> 01:15:52,850
which are the Swyambhus”  and you have accepted it.

232
01:15:53,042 --> 01:15:56,729
 I know in Tukarama’s place, you all were jumping

233
01:15:56,824 --> 01:16:03,424
and very enjoying it because
you could feel the chaitanya, you could feel the vibrations.

234
01:16:03,613 --> 01:16:09,373
So first you should know about Nirakaar
and then you can find out about Sakaar.

235
01:16:09,635 --> 01:16:13,977
There is no quarrel about it. But if you are not a realized soul,

236
01:16:14,065 --> 01:16:20,711
 how can you say which place is Swyambhu and which is not?

237
01:16:21,313 --> 01:16:23,445
So the whole problem is solved,

238
01:16:23,548 --> 01:16:30,459
but first you must have the knowledge,
 the knowledge of vibrations.

239
01:16:30,895 --> 01:16:36,151
 Now if you ask Me a very serious question
that we are having in our country,

240
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:41,789
which I would like to tell you about is about Shri Rama’s mandir.

241
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:47,191
Was Shri Rama was born there or not? He was!

242
01:16:53,992 --> 01:16:58,435
 You can feel it onto your hands.
 You can feel it. All of you can feel it.

243
01:16:58,515 --> 01:17:01,226
He was born there. No doubt!

244
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:03,808
 But for that, what is there to fight?

245
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:07,996
Whether it’s a masjid or anything Shri Rama was born there.

246
01:17:08,021 --> 01:17:11,054
Vibrations are there, whatever it may be.

247
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:18,512
But to glorify Him you must have a temple, doesn’t matter.

248
01:17:18,584 --> 01:17:22,365
Whether you have a masjid or a temple is the same,

249
01:17:22,707 --> 01:17:28,592
 and if you want to have a temple you must do it
after realization not before that.

250
01:17:32,582 --> 01:17:38,864
 And also you should put there only realized souls who
will be in charge of the Puja.

251
01:17:39,753 --> 01:17:46,027
Then only you will do real credit to that great soul of Shri Rama.

252
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:51,133
 All of them here, whether whatever their country from,
they know Shri Rama.

253
01:17:51,371 --> 01:17:55,861
Not only that, but they know where He is within us

254
01:17:56,259 --> 01:17:58,404
and they know how to worship Him.

255
01:17:58,499 --> 01:18:00,545
They also know about Mohammad Sahib.

256
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:03,949
 They also know about Christ.
They know the truth about Them

257
01:18:04,005 --> 01:18:06,927
within their own body, within themselves.

258
01:18:07,047 --> 01:18:11,664
Once that is the knowledge, the true knowledge,

259
01:18:12,022 --> 01:18:15,693
the absolute knowledge then what is the quarrel about?

260
01:18:15,962 --> 01:18:20,419
 Everybody feels the same way.
What will you quarrel for?

261
01:18:20,539 --> 01:18:25,297
 If I say that My country, India, is a Yogabhumi; all right,

262
01:18:25,369 --> 01:18:30,761
 you ask all of them whether they come from
 this country or that country,  all Sahaja Yogis they will say so.

263
01:18:30,999 --> 01:18:36,806
 So when they come from abroad, they bow to this country,

264
01:18:36,964 --> 01:18:43,076
while we Indians may not. They do,
because they know this is a Yogabhumi

265
01:18:43,179 --> 01:18:50,527
and the Kundalini of the whole universe is inside this Yogabhumi.

266
01:18:51,138 --> 01:18:57,609
So all these great things about our country

267
01:18:57,856 --> 01:19:03,938
are to be understood through the vibrations
which Adi Shakaracharya called as Spund.

268
01:19:04,176 --> 01:19:08,014
 Actually most of their poetry could not -

269
01:19:08,301 --> 01:19:14,046
because they were not prose - could not explain
to normal people what it was.

270
01:19:14,165 --> 01:19:19,401
 But I think that if you go deep into these matters

271
01:19:19,426 --> 01:19:26,083
 and understand the absolute knowledge
 about all this through your Spund,

272
01:19:26,108 --> 01:19:30,764
 through your vibrations, you will know what is the truth.

273
01:19:30,874 --> 01:19:38,604
Because what’s the use of fighting for falsehood?
 It’s like fighting the darkness.

274
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:41,820
Why not have light and see for yourself?

275
01:19:41,915 --> 01:19:44,850
I, today, I have taken some liberty with you, Sir,

276
01:19:44,898 --> 01:19:49,981
 because I wanted to tell you that in this country of ours

277
01:19:50,044 --> 01:19:53,894
 we have the greatest knowledge about Buddha

278
01:19:55,775 --> 01:20:03,446
 Whole Sahaja Yoga is based, whatever I know,
 is from - mostly from - our shastras.

279
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:07,945
 It’s not ritualism. It’s the deeper knowledge.

280
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:11,672
All saints, whether you take Kabir, you take Nanaka,

281
01:20:11,743 --> 01:20:16,368
Mohammad Sahib, anyone –
all of them have said, “Seek yourself within”.

282
01:20:16,398 --> 01:20:20,324
Why did they say so? Why did they say so?

283
01:20:20,365 --> 01:20:24,058
Because inside is the truth, the absolute truth,

284
01:20:24,146 --> 01:20:29,639
and with that absolute truth all these stupid,
stupid things will drop out

285
01:20:30,174 --> 01:20:32,680
 and you become a different personality.

286
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:39,255
 As it is, the time has come for
 the whole world to change and transform.

287
01:20:39,374 --> 01:20:46,557
But you know, I now request you all to do lot of work for Me

288
01:20:46,906 --> 01:20:54,511
 I have done that was possible for Me
 to work it out and it has worked, no doubt.

289
01:20:54,585 --> 01:21:01,715
But you all can do it and change you -first of all your own society,

290
01:21:01,882 --> 01:21:07,326
change your own countrymen, change also, then globally you can go.

291
01:21:07,398 --> 01:21:12,561
You can help, say for example, in India,
some people can come and help here,

292
01:21:12,586 --> 01:21:15,971
and from India some could go and help there.

293
01:21:16,027 --> 01:21:19,360
So now you are well equipped with that knowledge.

294
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:21,476
So you should come and work it out.

295
01:21:21,524 --> 01:21:27,419
 And, I must thank people from Australia who went now to Orissa.

296
01:21:27,514 --> 01:21:34,176
 And they have formed nine centers - nine centers of Sahaja Yoga.

297
01:21:41,685 --> 01:21:45,376
This is happening and you know you can do it.
