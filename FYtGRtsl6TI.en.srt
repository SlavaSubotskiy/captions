1
00:55:07,607 --> 00:55:21,007
Our honored guest, our respected Home Affairs Ministry is here,

2
00:55:22,146 --> 00:55:28,980
Mr. Advani, who has been always a very great dezabhakt [patriot].

3
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:34,880
 I admired him because he loved his country; he is very patriotic.

4
00:55:35,378 --> 00:55:38,178
And this is ...

5
00:55:53,864 --> 00:56:01,764
And as you know, my father and mother both were very patriotic.

6
00:56:01,764 --> 00:56:05,164
They sacrificed everything for the country,

7
00:56:05,337 --> 00:56:12,637
 and I also was always condemned by everyone
as being a very patriotic person.

8
00:56:21,165 --> 00:56:25,565
We must love the country in which we are born.

9
00:56:25,992 --> 00:56:33,292
There is some connection, very great connection,
 between yourself and your country.

10
00:56:33,292 --> 00:56:37,992
And I have seen that after Sahaja Yoga, all those

11
00:56:38,222 --> 00:56:43,922
who have been transformed into new visions and new ideas

12
00:56:43,922 --> 00:56:50,422
always know what’s wrong in their own country. And so conscious of it!

13
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:56,307
 I am surprised that every one of them have been able to tell Me

14
00:56:56,307 --> 00:57:00,307
 what’s wrong in their country and what should be done.

15
00:57:00,465 --> 00:57:08,165
They never identified with the wrongs or the misdeeds of their country.

16
00:57:08,165 --> 00:57:09,965
It’s very surprising.

17
00:57:10,265 --> 00:57:14,565
On the contrary they said, “Mother, all these countries

18
00:57:14,778 --> 00:57:18,878
require Your attention so that they should be corrected.”

19
00:57:18,878 --> 00:57:21,378
 Their politicians should be corrected.

20
00:57:21,378 --> 00:57:23,978
Their citizens should be corrected

21
00:57:24,222 --> 00:57:34,022
and that people should really evolve into a new consciousness.

22
00:57:34,607 --> 00:57:37,507
All of them have been working it out.

23
00:57:37,507 --> 00:57:41,807
Now we have here very few Sahaja Yogis from abroad,

24
00:57:41,965 --> 00:57:46,365
but I tell you it’s surprising how these Sahaja Yogis

25
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:52,765
have enlightened thousands and thousands
of Sahaja Yogis all over the world.

26
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:57,137
 They are the ones who are working. I am not working like them.

27
00:57:57,293 --> 00:58:04,993
 They work very hard. You can see the way we have got these felicitations from all these people,

28
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:11,423
 all because they approached these people, told them all about Sahaja Yoga,

29
00:58:11,423 --> 00:58:14,223
they might have even given them Realization.

30
00:58:14,437 --> 00:58:17,537
And that’s how they have worked it out.

31
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:23,337
So, we have to worry about our own country and its own problems.

32
00:58:23,337 --> 00:58:25,537
 Why these problems are there?

33
00:58:25,537 --> 00:58:30,737
 And I tell you, your wishes and your efforts

34
00:58:30,866 --> 00:58:36,266
will definitely improve the conditions of your own countries.

35
00:58:36,566 --> 00:58:42,166
 And it’s happening in everywhere, also should happen in India.

36
00:58:43,164 --> 00:58:53,530
Once we are Realized souls, it is our most important duty is, first of all,

37
00:58:53,658 --> 00:59:01,410
look after your own societies,  look after your own country.

38
00:59:01,865 --> 00:59:07,165
If you can’t do that, what’s the use of getting Self-realization?

39
00:59:07,478 --> 00:59:13,178
 Because Self-realization stands on one power -
and the power of love.

40
00:59:13,307 --> 00:59:18,107
And one art - art of selfless love.

41
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:22,822
If that is there, immediately you start seeing the people

42
00:59:22,822 --> 00:59:26,622
who are surrounding you, who are in your village,

43
00:59:26,622 --> 00:59:33,322
who are also in the neighborhood,

44
00:59:33,438 --> 00:59:38,738
or also who are in your city and in your country.

45
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:47,467
Immediately you start understanding what’s the problem, even your own society.

46
00:59:48,065 --> 00:59:50,965
 I have seen, after coming to Sahaja Yoga

47
00:59:51,093 --> 00:59:55,793
 people have tried to improve so many things in their own society.

48
00:59:56,537 --> 01:00:01,437
Now we have many Hindus, many Muslims,

49
01:00:01,746 --> 01:00:06,446
Christians, all kinds of people, but I was amazed at one thing.

50
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:15,995
 Once they got Realization, they never identified
with the wrong things of their society or of their religions.

51
01:00:16,223 --> 01:00:20,323
On the contrary they wanted to improve it and work it out.

52
01:00:20,551 --> 01:00:23,751
But there’s a very simple way of doing it.

53
01:00:24,223 --> 01:00:32,147
You don’t have to go out of the way to change people or to  make any sacrifices,

54
01:00:32,147 --> 01:00:33,981
nothing of the kind.

55
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:39,424
Everybody today is suffering from some sort of anxiety,

56
01:00:39,566 --> 01:00:45,366
some sort of problems, some sort of worries.

57
01:00:45,551 --> 01:00:49,551
Also they are suffering from other problems.

58
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:57,350
Now if you can tell them that,
 “you can be transformed, you can be transformed.”

59
01:00:57,493 --> 01:01:07,793
 Transformed into a being which is absolutely above all these worries, above all these problems.

60
01:01:07,937 --> 01:01:10,837
 How can that be? One can ask.

61
01:01:10,993 --> 01:01:15,693
Actually, what happens that when you get your Self-realization,

62
01:01:15,693 --> 01:01:22,993
your attention gets enlightened by the Self, means the Spirit,

63
01:01:23,322 --> 01:01:28,522
and automatically you start dropping your destructive habits,

64
01:01:28,678 --> 01:01:33,778
destructive thoughts and destructive activities.

65
01:01:33,778 --> 01:01:36,678
You suddenly become so constructive.

66
01:01:36,837 --> 01:01:41,737
Now I’ll tell you one thing, I was amazed when I was in Togliatti in Russia.

67
01:01:41,978 --> 01:01:48,278
A news came to Me that the head of the mafia has become a Sahaja Yogi.

68
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:54,795
 And I was, I was so touched by that.

69
01:01:55,278 --> 01:02:00,478
And he came to Me and he said, "I was doing all nonsensical things.

70
01:02:00,478 --> 01:02:05,478
 I never got any satisfaction, no joy. But this is something.

71
01:02:05,478 --> 01:02:10,178
 I really can feel the joy and satisfaction within myself.

72
01:02:10,178 --> 01:02:13,746
Mother, whatever was my past, will You forgive me?"

73
01:02:13,746 --> 01:02:19,746
I said, "Forgiven".

74
01:02:21,308 --> 01:02:26,508
"What is important is the present, and now you have become a Sahaja Yogi.

75
01:02:26,508 --> 01:02:33,508
 It’s such a credit to your spiritual growth, the way you have achieved it."

76
01:02:33,965 --> 01:02:40,565
 He said, "Now, I have that peace. I have that joy and I want to share it with others.

77
01:02:41,365 --> 01:02:45,565
I could never share my money with others.  I used to grab money from others".

78
01:02:45,565 --> 01:02:48,965
I said, "I don’t want to have any confessions. Finished!

79
01:02:49,207 --> 01:02:54,007
Now, as you have become a Sahaja Yogi, what will you do?"

80
01:02:54,907 --> 01:02:56,707
Surprisingly, he was very sweet.

81
01:02:56,707 --> 01:03:00,107
 He said, "I will send some onions to India".

82
01:03:00,107 --> 01:03:01,407
I said, “Why?”

83
01:03:01,407 --> 01:03:04,907
He said, “Because there is a problem about onions.”

84
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:11,050
I thought, “Look at this man, how genuine he has become, how humane.”

85
01:03:11,308 --> 01:03:14,208
 I said, "We have no such problem. You don’t worry".

86
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:21,208
And then you see his way of looking at things and working out things was so tremendous

87
01:03:21,408 --> 01:03:25,508
that the same fellow who was a big mafia leader

88
01:03:25,508 --> 01:03:31,908
has become such a big, great, honorable person in that area.

89
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:38,880
 And then he wanted to be elected to the municipal- some elections.

90
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:43,746
I said, "Go ahead. You’ll be elected.  If you are not elected, doesn’t matter".

91
01:03:43,746 --> 01:03:46,046
But he got elected also.

92
01:03:46,195 --> 01:03:53,195
So, you see how things work out for a person who wants to be the Spirit.

93
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,980
 Shivaji has said, "Swadharma Jagwawa".

94
01:03:57,122 --> 01:04:02,036
This is the only message he gave for the future: "Swadharma Jagwawa".

95
01:04:02,036 --> 01:04:05,713
 "Swa" means the Spirit. You awaken your Spirit.

96
01:04:06,394 --> 01:04:09,323
 That is what we have to achieve.

97
01:04:09,323 --> 01:04:11,639
 Because he himself was a Realized soul.

98
01:04:12,946 --> 01:04:19,050
So, he said, "This is what you have to do,  is to make your Spirit awaken".

99
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:25,950
Now with that light of the Spirit, what happens?

100
01:04:26,878 --> 01:04:33,478
You just see clearly, very clearly, you see what’s wrong with you,

101
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:36,878
what’s wrong with your society, what’s wrong in your country.

102
01:04:36,878 --> 01:04:43,878
Everything you see very clearly, and you also have power to correct it.

103
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:50,708
 If you are aware of your power and if you have mastered it, you can do it.

104
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:57,308
 You can do it not for yourself, but for your family,
for your society, for everyone.

105
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:01,407
My husband always used to say,  “You are a socialist

106
01:05:02,146 --> 01:05:05,046
 because You can’t exist Yourself alone.

107
01:05:05,046 --> 01:05:09,946
 You must share with others. Because, you see, You are so collective.”

108
01:05:10,246 --> 01:05:15,246
But the thing is, you see, we have to understand we are a collective.

109
01:05:15,692 --> 01:05:18,292
We cannot exist alone anywhere,

110
01:05:18,449 --> 01:05:21,949
we are all collective. We are not aware of it.

111
01:05:21,949 --> 01:05:25,649
But when you become aware of it, you are so surprised

112
01:05:25,746 --> 01:05:29,137
 that you are part and parcel of the whole.

113
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:36,937
That you don’t have to look for company
 in your own society, in your own samaj. Nothing.

114
01:05:37,492 --> 01:05:44,092
 What you want is just to have the company of all the Sahaja Yogis,

115
01:05:44,092 --> 01:05:51,892
 and this has proved beyond doubt that if you are spiritually awakened,

116
01:05:52,478 --> 01:05:58,710
 you have no quarrels with each other, no hatred, no competition.

117
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:02,110
 I have not seen anybody doing that in Sahaja Yoga.

118
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:09,810
And that is how things have become so much better
 for all of you together and also outside.

119
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:17,210
One of the ambassadors, she told Me that, “Mother, we are very happy.”

120
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:18,079
I said, “Why?”

121
01:06:18,264 --> 01:06:22,364
“Because we are not competitive. So everybody is happy with us.”

122
01:06:22,364 --> 01:06:30,764
This is what it is: that you realize  that you don’t have to worry about getting something higher position,

123
01:06:30,962 --> 01:06:37,626
getting into something very rich, you can say properties. No!

124
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:42,385
Because the satisfaction part is within you.

125
01:06:42,385 --> 01:06:47,685
You are so satisfied within yourself that you don’t run after things.

126
01:06:47,685 --> 01:06:52,285
 Like the economics, the modern economics, as it is,

127
01:06:52,285 --> 01:07:01,585
 it is based on one simple factor that human beings are never satisfied.

128
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:08,527
 Today they want something, they’ll run for it and do every sort of thing

129
01:07:08,527 --> 01:07:10,381
and make money, get it.

130
01:07:10,908 --> 01:07:13,752
Then they are not satisfied. They want to have something else.

131
01:07:13,752 --> 01:07:16,446
And then they want to have something else.

132
01:07:16,446 --> 01:07:21,546
This is the basis of economics - I mean, modern economics.

133
01:07:22,692 --> 01:07:24,692
 But Sahaja Yoga is different.

134
01:07:24,692 --> 01:07:29,392
Sahaja Yoga economics is this thing: that I have got Realization.

135
01:07:29,392 --> 01:07:33,592
All right! I must share with others.

136
01:07:34,078 --> 01:07:37,978
 If I have got the satisfaction, I must share with them.

137
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:45,920
The sharing part is so important in Sahaja Yoga, and which people are doing with such beauty.

138
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:51,520
 As I told you the other day that we have to learn the art of loving.

139
01:07:51,737 --> 01:07:56,737
 It’s very simple if you know how to say few sweet things,

140
01:07:56,737 --> 01:08:04,037
how to give something sweetly, how to share with others very sweetly.

141
01:08:04,793 --> 01:08:12,393
It is not difficult for you at all because you have got your Spirit to give you the joy.

142
01:08:12,578 --> 01:08:17,578
 I know Sahaja Yoga has done wonders.
People have given up drugs overnight.

143
01:08:17,578 --> 01:08:20,878
Now in America they have a proposal for us

144
01:08:20,878 --> 01:08:26,882
that we should start a drug addiction thing, is to remove the drug addictions,

145
01:08:26,882 --> 01:08:30,546
some sort of an organization and all that.

146
01:08:30,546 --> 01:08:34,246
And Sahaja Yogis said that, "We have one million dollar.

147
01:08:34,246 --> 01:08:36,046
Can we do with that?” “No, No!”

148
01:08:36,046 --> 01:08:38,446
they said, "We’ll give you twenty-one million dollars".

149
01:08:38,446 --> 01:08:41,595
“What will you do with twenty-one million dollars?” I said.

150
01:08:41,595 --> 01:08:44,495
 “If you want to build something for the drug addiction,

151
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,895
you only need them to come there.

152
01:08:46,895 --> 01:08:49,095
 Overnight, they will give up their drugs".

153
01:08:49,095 --> 01:08:52,695
I have seen that and there are some sitting here.

154
01:09:01,222 --> 01:09:04,422
Such a power your Spirit has!

155
01:09:04,422 --> 01:09:08,822
Such a beauty it has, and such love and peace it has!

156
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:14,680
 Only it is to be brought into your attention which is going hither, thither, thither.

157
01:09:14,908 --> 01:09:20,508
 Only if your attention is enlightened by the Spirit,

158
01:09:20,508 --> 01:09:23,708
you become such a wonderful person.

159
01:09:24,065 --> 01:09:29,965
 All these things as they had described in Sanskrit –
the Kaam, Krodha, Mada, Matsa, Lobha, Moha –

160
01:09:30,178 --> 01:09:33,078
 all of them drop by themselves.

161
01:09:33,078 --> 01:09:37,078
All the anger, all the stupid things we do,

162
01:09:37,078 --> 01:09:41,278
 and all the aggressive things we do, drops out.

163
01:09:41,623 --> 01:09:47,923
I have asked some Sahaja Yogis to go to Kashmir
and make them Sahaja Yogis.

164
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:51,358
 If you can make them Sahaja Yogis this problem will be over.

165
01:09:51,722 --> 01:09:54,922
 And there are some willing to go there.

166
01:09:55,581 --> 01:09:58,581
Some foreign Sahaja Yogis specially have offered

167
01:09:58,865 --> 01:10:02,665
their services to go and change the people’s mind.

168
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:05,935
 Now we have! We have changed people,

169
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:12,735
 like we have now in a place called Benin, there are seven hundred -

170
01:10:13,193 --> 01:10:20,093
 seven thousand - Muslims who were very fundamentalist,

171
01:10:20,093 --> 01:10:22,593
they all have become Sahaja Yogis.

172
01:10:25,235 --> 01:10:30,435
In Turkey, we have already two thousand Sahaja Yogis. In Turkey!

173
01:10:30,578 --> 01:10:34,578
 So even fanaticism of any kind - among Hindus or

174
01:10:34,578 --> 01:10:39,478
among Muslims, among Christians - can be easily changed because

175
01:10:39,478 --> 01:10:44,878
they will see the beauty of their Spirit,

176
01:10:44,878 --> 01:10:49,578
and their religion itself will get enlightened.

177
01:10:50,722 --> 01:10:55,922
They will see the beauty of their religion.
They will see the oneness of all these religions,

178
01:10:55,922 --> 01:11:04,322
and like that a global religion can be accepted
 where all religions will be understood properly.

179
01:11:04,465 --> 01:11:09,465
There have been deviations in every religion and that’s why there’s a problem.

180
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:14,165
Can you fight in the name of religion when there is only one God?

181
01:11:14,308 --> 01:11:18,408
They do because they are ignorant. I don’t blame them.

182
01:11:18,408 --> 01:11:21,108
They have no light. But once they have the light,

183
01:11:21,251 --> 01:11:26,851
they will understand what is the global nature of religion.

184
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:32,808
Now, you’ll be surprised that Sahaja Yoga - or we can call the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma -

185
01:11:32,808 --> 01:11:39,808
has been accepted in Russia as a religious identity.

186
01:11:49,746 --> 01:11:53,846
But it is not religion like other religions are.

187
01:11:54,551 --> 01:11:57,651
 It is not at all of that kind.

188
01:11:57,851 --> 01:12:03,551
It’s a religion where only we believe in compassion,  love

189
01:12:03,865 --> 01:12:09,465
and also in our own power that nobody can touch you.

190
01:12:09,678 --> 01:12:12,378
 Nobody can kill you.

191
01:12:12,378 --> 01:12:18,378
You will be amazed that there was such a big earthquake in Turkey

192
01:12:18,378 --> 01:12:22,578
 but Sahaja Yogis, none of them were touched.

193
01:12:22,853 --> 01:12:28,853
Even their houses were completely all right when the rest was all destroyed.

194
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:38,950
 So many places, so many places it has happened.

195
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:41,650
We had hurricane there - the same thing.

196
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:44,550
 All over, they are sending Me reports, “Mother,

197
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:47,850
how all the Sahaja Yogis are saved.”

198
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:50,880
How they are perfectly all right!

199
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,980
Because youare protected by the Divine power!

200
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:59,880
 We have to believe in the Divine power, which all the religions have believed.

201
01:13:00,493 --> 01:13:07,093
 Then the problem comes whether you should believe in the form or formless.

202
01:13:07,308 --> 01:13:13,108
 Then you will realize that with the formless
only you can understand the form.

203
01:13:13,266 --> 01:13:19,266
Very simple thing it is to look at, but it is really extremely surprising.

204
01:13:20,346 --> 01:13:29,277
For example, once I said that Mecca is Meccashwara Shiva written down in our books.

205
01:13:29,277 --> 01:13:31,550
But I didn’t know that I just said it.

206
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:37,650
Now I read an article that they were all worshippers of Shiva.

207
01:13:39,093 --> 01:13:45,693
And this is something surprising that Mohammad Sahib never talked about any religion.

208
01:13:45,693 --> 01:13:51,193
Nobody has read even that, we can say, the Koran.
Nobody has read.

209
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:55,393
We have a very good book written on Koran,  which of course I guided,

210
01:13:55,393 --> 01:14:00,193
 and it’s so clearly saying what Mohammad Sahib has said.

211
01:14:00,193 --> 01:14:02,593
I mean also this brings discredit to people.

212
01:14:02,724 --> 01:14:06,224
Christ never said things which Christians are saying.

213
01:14:06,466 --> 01:14:08,066
Same with the Hindus.

214
01:14:08,251 --> 01:14:14,051
They are doing things which was never,  never written in any shastra.

215
01:14:14,466 --> 01:14:20,266
 Very surprising that these people who are in charge of religion

216
01:14:20,506 --> 01:14:27,106
 they are the ones who are spoiling the image of religions and creating this problem.

217
01:14:27,106 --> 01:14:31,406
 I don’t know why they want to do it.
 What is the use?

218
01:14:31,524 --> 01:14:40,024
Now, regarding, regarding Sakara [God in Form] and Nirakara [Formless]  it’s very simple to be understood.

219
01:14:40,465 --> 01:14:51,165
After getting Realization, you can feel the 'spanda" you can call it or vibratory awareness is there.

220
01:14:51,535 --> 01:14:57,435
 With that you can feel what is truth what is not.

221
01:14:57,435 --> 01:15:05,935
Now I would say that there is no truth in worshipping a statue

222
01:15:05,935 --> 01:15:12,535
 which is created by a drunkard or a person
who is using it for money.

223
01:15:12,665 --> 01:15:19,895
 But even in the Bible it is said that whatever created by the sky

224
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:24,295
or by the Mother Earth should not be disrespected.

225
01:15:24,907 --> 01:15:27,407
This is what we call as the swayambhu.

226
01:15:27,407 --> 01:15:36,507
 But swayambhus for people who are not Realized souls, is just a sort of a ritual, a karmakand.

227
01:15:36,851 --> 01:15:43,151
It’s just a karmakand. They don’t understand  whether this, whatever is a swayambhu or not.

228
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:48,780
Now, you being Sahaja Yogis, you have seen what I have told you that “go and see

229
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:52,680
which are the Swyambhus”  and you have accepted it.

230
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:58,099
 I know in Tukarama’s place, you all were jumping and were enjoying it

231
01:15:58,099 --> 01:16:03,280
because you could feel the chaitanya, you could feel the vibrations.

232
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:09,393
So first, you should know about Nirakara and then you can find out about Sakara.

233
01:16:09,608 --> 01:16:13,908
There is no quarrel about it. But if you are not a Realized soul,

234
01:16:13,908 --> 01:16:20,608
 how can you say which place is swayambhu and which is not?

235
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:23,550
So, the whole problem is solved.

236
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:30,450
But first you, must have the knowledge,  the knowledge of vibrations.

237
01:16:30,922 --> 01:16:36,222
Now if you ask Me a very serious question that we are having in our country,

238
01:16:36,222 --> 01:16:41,822
which I would like to tell you about is about Shri Rama’s mandir.

239
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:47,023
Was Shri Rama was born there or not? He was!

240
01:16:53,937 --> 01:16:58,437
 You can feel it onto your hands.  You can feel it. All of you can feel it.

241
01:16:58,437 --> 01:17:01,137
He was born there. No doubt!

242
01:17:01,265 --> 01:17:03,865
 But for that, what is there to fight?

243
01:17:03,865 --> 01:17:07,965
Whether it’s a masjid or anything Shri Rama was born there.

244
01:17:07,965 --> 01:17:11,419
Vibrations are there, whatever it may be.

245
01:17:13,323 --> 01:17:18,423
But to glorify Him you must have a temple, doesn’t matter.

246
01:17:18,423 --> 01:17:22,223
Whether you have a masjid or a temple is the same,

247
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:28,480
 and if you want to have a temple you must do it
after realization not before that.

248
01:17:32,395 --> 01:17:38,695
 And also you should put there only Realized souls who will be in charge of the puja.

249
01:17:39,453 --> 01:17:45,753
Then only you will do real credit to that great soul of Shri Rama.

250
01:17:46,065 --> 01:17:51,165
 All of them here, whether whatever their country from, they know Shri Rama.

251
01:17:51,535 --> 01:17:56,035
Not only that, but they know where He is within us

252
01:17:56,035 --> 01:17:58,235
and they know how to worship Him.

253
01:17:58,351 --> 01:18:00,451
They also know about Mohammad Sahib.

254
01:18:00,451 --> 01:18:03,851
 They also know about Christ. They know the truth about Them

255
01:18:03,851 --> 01:18:06,751
within their own body, within themselves.

256
01:18:06,751 --> 01:18:11,351
Once that is the knowledge, the true knowledge,

257
01:18:12,008 --> 01:18:15,608
the absolute knowledge then what is the quarrel about?

258
01:18:15,937 --> 01:18:20,437
 Everybody feels the same way. What will you quarrel for?

259
01:18:20,437 --> 01:18:25,137
 If I say that my country, India, is a Yogabhumi; all right,

260
01:18:25,337 --> 01:18:30,737
 you ask all of them whether they come from this country or that country,  all Sahaja Yogis they will say so.

261
01:18:30,965 --> 01:18:36,865
 So when they come from abroad, they bow to this country,

262
01:18:36,865 --> 01:18:42,965
while we Indians may not. They do, because they know this is a Yogabhumi

263
01:18:43,278 --> 01:18:50,678
and the Kundalini of the whole universe is inside this Yogabhumi.

264
01:18:51,137 --> 01:18:57,637
So, all these great things about our country

265
01:18:57,751 --> 01:19:03,851
are to be understood through the vibrations which Adi Shakaracharya called as "spanda".

266
01:19:04,023 --> 01:19:07,923
 Actually, most of their poetry could not -

267
01:19:08,053 --> 01:19:13,753
because they were not prose - could not explain
to normal people what it was.

268
01:19:14,165 --> 01:19:19,465
 But I think that if you go deep into these matters

269
01:19:19,465 --> 01:19:26,065
 and understand the absolute knowledge
 about all this through your "spanda",

270
01:19:26,065 --> 01:19:30,665
 through your vibrations, you will know what is the truth.

271
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:38,465
Because what’s the use of fighting for falsehood?
 It’s like fighting the darkness.

272
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:41,808
Why not have light and see for yourself?

273
01:19:41,808 --> 01:19:44,708
I, today, I have taken some liberty with you, Sir,

274
01:19:44,708 --> 01:19:49,808
 because I wanted to tell you that in this country of ours

275
01:19:49,808 --> 01:19:53,608
 we have the greatest knowledge about truth.

276
01:19:55,424 --> 01:20:03,124
 Whole Sahaja Yoga is based, whatever I know,  is from - mostly from - our shastras.

277
01:20:04,308 --> 01:20:07,908
 It’s not ritualism. It’s the deeper knowledge.

278
01:20:07,908 --> 01:20:11,508
All saints, whether you take Kabir, you take Nanaka,

279
01:20:11,508 --> 01:20:16,449
Mohammad Sahib, anyone – all of them have said, “Seek yourself within”.

280
01:20:16,449 --> 01:20:20,449
Why did they say so? Why did they say so?

281
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:24,149
Because inside is the truth, the absolute truth,

282
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:29,778
and with that absolute truth all these stupid, stupid things will drop out

283
01:20:29,995 --> 01:20:32,495
 and you become a different personality.

284
01:20:32,623 --> 01:20:39,123
 As it is, the time has come for  the whole world to change and transform.

285
01:20:39,393 --> 01:20:46,593
But you know, I now request you all to do lot of work for Me.

286
01:20:46,823 --> 01:20:54,423
 I have done that was possible for Me to work it out and it has worked, no doubt.

287
01:20:54,622 --> 01:21:01,822
But you all can do it and change you - first of all, your own society,

288
01:21:01,822 --> 01:21:07,322
change your own countrymen, change also, then globally you can go.

289
01:21:07,322 --> 01:21:12,522
You can help, say for example, in India, some people can come and help here,

290
01:21:12,522 --> 01:21:15,809
and from India some could go and help there.

291
01:21:15,923 --> 01:21:19,223
So, now you are well equipped with that knowledge.

292
01:21:19,481 --> 01:21:21,481
So you should come and work it out.

293
01:21:21,481 --> 01:21:27,381
 And, I must thank people from Australia who went now to Orissa.

294
01:21:27,593 --> 01:21:34,193
And they have formed nine centers - nine centers of Sahaja Yoga.

295
01:21:41,807 --> 01:21:45,507
This is happening and you know you can do it.

296
01:21:45,507 --> 01:21:51,207
 You are quite capable of giving Realization to people.

297
01:21:51,207 --> 01:21:55,007
And, please now I request all of you

298
01:21:55,007 --> 01:22:02,107
to try this gift that you have, to be shared with others.
