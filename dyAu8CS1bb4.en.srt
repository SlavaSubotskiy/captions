1
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:13,515
Today we are celebrating here a special
day called Makar Sankrant.

2
00:00:13,716 --> 00:00:21,230
For the information of the foreign Sahaja
Yogis, I will explain to you what it means.

3
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:26,455
[Shri Mataji explains that She will speak
first in English then in Marathi].

4
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:32,212
It means the day - today is the day the sun

5
00:00:32,413 --> 00:00:44,206
crosses over from the Tropic of Capricorn
to the Tropic of Cancer.

6
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,922
It’s a very big day for us because, now

7
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:58,365
during the summer time we have the harvest,
and we look forward to the rain

8
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:03,198
and so many things that happen in every
country.

9
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:12,499
The sun falls at right angles in this
country during the summer season

10
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,004
and so we welcome the sun. We eat something

11
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:24,524
that you must have eaten already, what we
call as til and jaggery.

12
00:01:24,724 --> 00:01:28,802
It is to prepare your body and your mind

13
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:32,592
to give it sufficient heat to receive
the sun.

14
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:37,531
Because if you are living in the cold
season,

15
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:45,690
then all your body, mind becomes lethargic

16
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:53,762
and you become also sometimes very lazy
about things, in the sense

17
00:01:53,963 --> 00:02:01,488
that the day is so small that you cannot
achieve many results.

18
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:10,286
So the body has become cold as we call it.
We take these things, which give us heat,

19
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:15,228
so body is prepared to receive the heat
of the sun to welcome it.

20
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:23,938
To overcome the inertia set in by the cold
weather,

21
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:32,096
and also to invigorate the body's strength,
tune to the sun,

22
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:39,038
people take to all these ways of greeting
you

23
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:45,157
by which they give you something that is
heat-creating in the body.

24
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:51,926
But it has another very subtle expression,
which I find is this:

25
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:56,056
that when they give you this, they say,
“Now you take til and gul

26
00:02:56,257 --> 00:03:00,974
and you say things which are sweet”.

27
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:05,825
Because when you are taking til and gul,
your body gets heated up

28
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:11,167
and you become right-sided person. When you
become right-sided person

29
00:03:11,368 --> 00:03:16,300
you seldom speak sweetly. So it is
a contrast

30
00:03:16,501 --> 00:03:20,721
that they give you a thing to heat you up
so that your body gets heated up

31
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:25,239
but you must speak sweetly.

32
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,384
So there is a warning that you are eating
all these things

33
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:33,454
but that doesn't mean now you ride on a big
horse of ego

34
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:37,003
and start slashing everyone.

35
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:41,962
It's a very subtle thing to understand that
when we become

36
00:03:42,163 --> 00:03:48,356
temperamentally right-sided, we are so much
covered by our ego

37
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:53,568
that we do not feel that we are hurting
others by what we say.

38
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:57,526
If there are two egoistical people, they
can manage among themselves.

39
00:03:57,727 --> 00:04:01,861
But if there is one egoistical and another
one who is subdued,

40
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:05,208
then the subdued will be finished.

41
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:10,197
That's why they say today is the day when
we start speaking very sweetly.

42
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:14,265
Even if there is some enemy or somebody
who is not friendly with you,

43
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:18,800
or there has been some misunderstanding,
this is the day we say that,

44
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:26,516
“All right, take this and say something
very sweet. Talk sweetly to each other”.

45
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:30,727
But today only I think I received a letter
from a Sahaja Yogini,

46
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:36,717
which was so full of harshness that I was
surprised that I should receive it today.

47
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:39,804
Not to Me but some other Sahaja Yogi.

48
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:43,635
So one thing today we have to decide and
take a vow

49
00:04:43,836 --> 00:04:49,360
that to another Sahaja Yogi we are not
going to speak harshly,

50
00:04:50,895 --> 00:04:55,207
and talk to him in a way as if he is
an ordinary person.

51
00:04:55,408 --> 00:05:00,044
Now supposing he is a leader: then there is
more reason that you should respect.

52
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:06,258
And if he is a senior leader, then there is
more reason that you must respect.

53
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:11,500
The first thing one has to learn that we
have to respect.

54
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:16,737
Now the sun is so much respected in this
country that in early morning time

55
00:05:16,938 --> 00:05:23,021
all the people get up and say Namaskars
to Surya with all His names

56
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:28,288
and do a particular type of exercise to show
that they are completely surrendered

57
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:36,589
to the will of the Surya. When you do that,
then the ego doesn't come in.

58
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:42,787
Now the sun, when He shines here, it gives
you a feeling

59
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:47,316
that you have to be active, you have
to work very hard.

60
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:51,422
As a result of that, you might develop ego.

61
00:05:51,623 --> 00:05:57,754
But when you develop ego, then it surrounds
your brain completely,

62
00:05:57,955 --> 00:06:01,756
and when the brain is surrounded with ego,
you do not know

63
00:06:01,957 --> 00:06:06,979
which way to go. You do not know what is
right, what is wrong.

64
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,143
You do not have any discretion and no
direction.

65
00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:15,130
You do what you please, whatever pleases
ego.

66
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,673
And this is a day when we celebrate it in
a way to surrender ourselves to the Surya,

67
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:28,971
to the sun which is, as you know, is
the residence of Shri Lord Jesus Christ.

68
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:37,551
He resides on the sun. So how humble He
was, how humble He was residing on the sun.

69
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:42,882
The more you live on the sun there should
be much more humility.

70
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:47,896
Of course, I must say in India people are
humbler. But still,

71
00:06:48,097 --> 00:06:55,905
the quality of sun can make you extremely
arrogant and very unpleasant person.

72
00:06:56,106 --> 00:07:01,781
This unpleasant person can really ruin
all kinds of good relations.

73
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:08,354
But the worst thing that happens to us is
that we lose our integration.

74
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:12,260
Because when we say harsh things to anyone,
we feel guilty

75
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,244
so we have another problem, our heart feels
bad, our liver feels bad,

76
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:22,575
everything is upset. And thus we feel
absolutely disintegrated.

77
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:29,645
And disintegrated is a sign of our not
evolving at all

78
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:33,856
or we should say devolving.

79
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:39,760
Disintegration is such a common thing that
we see -

80
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:47,705
in ourselves we see that we fight with
our ego.

81
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:53,291
Then we fight with our superego, then we
fight with our heart,

82
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:59,162
with our emotions, and all the time we are
fighting within ourselves.

83
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:04,461
So at least within ourselves we should
speak sweetly on this day.

84
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:09,227
Then we can start speaking to others very,
very sweetly.

85
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:15,132
Now some people think, to speak sweetly is
a sign of weakness.

86
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:19,602
In some countries people believe that if
you speak to someone sweetly

87
00:08:19,803 --> 00:08:25,087
is a sign of weakness. It is the greatest
strength of a Sahaja Yogi

88
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:34,318
to speak to others with respect, with proper
protocol, and with proper understanding.

89
00:08:35,512 --> 00:08:38,926
Now because of arrogance, people also
forget

90
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:48,300
what is their situation is, and this
indiscreet temperament

91
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:53,616
gives you no sense of direction. You move
in every direction and you don't know

92
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:57,659
where you are going. As long as your ego
is satisfied,

93
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,241
you go ahead with it, and by the time you
discover that you have really become

94
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:08,209
a humpty-dumpty, you do not know what you
have done to yourself.

95
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,491
So the best way to conquer your ego is

96
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:17,306
to speak sweetly first of all. It’s such
a small thing to be done

97
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:25,762
but it brings you to that synthesis
of character within yourself first of all,

98
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:32,380
and to the synthesis of all the beautiful
principles of lives.

99
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:35,708
Like you talk to somebody sweetly,

100
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,923
the person may like you. He may tell you
something,

101
00:09:40,124 --> 00:09:45,576
which he may be knowing of a very great
importance for you.

102
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:53,545
If you talk to somebody sweetly, then you
may get the peace of mind

103
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:57,175
because you have given peace to another
person.

104
00:09:57,376 --> 00:10:00,608
Whatever you give to another person, that
you feel within yourself.

105
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,754
But if you are quarreling with another
person actually it is the reflection

106
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:07,916
of your quarrelling nature within yourself.

107
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:12,483
Today there is a big dearth, and big cry
and big organizations

108
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:19,024
working out the peace missions. The peace
mission is within yourself.

109
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:23,687
Let us start all of us the Sahaja Yogis who
are great saints sitting here,

110
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:28,239
decide today that we are going to make
peace with ourselves and with others.

111
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,721
But first and foremost thing the peace
cannot be made with quarrels.

112
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:37,219
You see, like America and Russia want
to decide it

113
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,518
with missiles, the peace part. They say,
“Let’s fight out.

114
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:46,513
As many as will remain, then they can live
in peace.

115
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:49,492
Let us all those who are fighting kill each
other”.

116
00:10:49,693 --> 00:10:53,782
They think this is the solution
of the problem. It's the other way around.

117
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:59,997
Let everybody live peacefully within
themselves and give peace to others,

118
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:07,019
so that this peace will become a nucleus
for the peace of the world.

119
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:17,563
So your great task today is to establish
a great source of peaceful people.

120
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:21,240
We are so many Sahaja Yogis here.

121
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:25,190
You are sitting in complete peace and
happiness and joy,

122
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:30,116
you don't know, you are emitting all that
peace, channelizing it and doing it.

123
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:37,826
But still there are some who are suffering
from horrible ego, and with hurt ego;

124
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:44,214
and they are trying to do something, which
they should never do, is to think just now.

125
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:48,326
If you are thinking just now, you will not
register what I am saying

126
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:54,624
because this is another quality of a person
who is ego oriented is not to register.

127
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:57,136
You may say anything you like but they
don't hear.

128
00:11:57,337 --> 00:12:00,431
They hear what they want to hear or they
don't hear.

129
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:04,397
So this is another thing we have to today
decide,

130
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:11,118
that we’ll register things than to tell
off. Let us register.

131
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:18,412
This is a sign of a character that wants
to know; wants to know more about;

132
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:25,038
the criteria of ascent is synthesis and
integration.

133
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:33,030
A person who is not integrated with other
Sahaja Yogis is not a man who has ascended.

134
00:12:33,231 --> 00:12:37,058
Who tries to divide and talk of divisions.

135
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:42,328
“We the English, We the Germans, We
the Indians,”

136
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,648
then they are not Sahaja Yogis. They are
Indians all right, but not Sahaja Yogis.

137
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:51,423
Sahaja Yogis have no caste, creed or
nationality.

138
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:56,660
We have to carry our passports only because
we are born in this jail.

139
00:12:56,861 --> 00:13:01,521
So we have to carry our criminal number!

140
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:08,179
But actually you don't need it. You don't
need all those things.

141
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,723
Now for us today to decide first of all
in our hearts

142
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:15,807
that we’ll take to peaceful methods.

143
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:19,835
When we are travelling, we’ll be taking
to peaceful methods.

144
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:25,044
Anybody who is trying to provoke you or
trying to create a problem

145
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:32,570
or divide you on any issue whatsoever, run
away from that person as fast as possible.

146
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:39,410
Anybody who talks of peace, the peace-
makers, stick on to that person -

147
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:45,412
then only you will understand that you are
also getting peace.

148
00:13:46,777 --> 00:13:52,719
Here you have come to get peace, not
to create problems,

149
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,344
or to listen to your problems, but to get
to peace.

150
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:07,790
Peace is a nature or is the quality of your
Spirit.

151
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:13,112
So, once you jump onto your peace somehow

152
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:21,130
what happens that you go beyond the cause
and the effect.

153
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:24,081
You are beyond the cause and the effect.

154
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:29,121
So the cause disappears and the effect also
disappears.

155
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:35,866
So today we all have come here to worship
the peace, the within and the without.

156
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:40,899
Let us be peaceful people. Let us not join
groups who hate,

157
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,734
who talk big, who want to hate one person,
want to create a group,

158
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:51,422
who says "we the Americans" or "we
the this", just.

159
00:14:51,623 --> 00:14:58,161
In Sahaja Yoga you must learn from people
who have advanced,

160
00:14:58,362 --> 00:15:03,744
who have very much progressed. For example
I would say among all the Europeans,

161
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:09,389
Australians have done very well. There’s
nothing to feel jealous.

162
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:14,995
All right, if Australians have done well,
alright that's your glory.

163
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:19,517
So ask them how they have done it, how
they have worked it out.

164
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:27,935
Tomorrow may be that Americans - I wish
that very much - may do the best,

165
00:15:28,472 --> 00:15:33,307
so then you should ask them how have you
done so well.

166
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:37,639
That's the way we’re going to live. We are
not going to compete,

167
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,183
we are not going to be jealous, but we are
going to absorb all that is best.

168
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:45,271
This is Sahaja Yoga. Is the other way
around,

169
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:48,754
like if they discover something -
a pilotless bomb -

170
00:15:48,955 --> 00:15:53,513
then they will discover something else
which is a machine-less bomb.

171
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:59,786
No, it is another one. We develop a mind
which absorbs everything,

172
00:15:59,987 --> 00:16:04,787
and then we develop a bigger mind, which
gives everything.

173
00:16:04,988 --> 00:16:10,610
There is no secret in Sahaja Yoga. Everybody
who has known something better,

174
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:14,877
has had some good experiences of Sahaja Yoga
should tell.

175
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:18,057
But then in ego I have seen people start
preaching

176
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:22,075
that, “All right, this method you try, that
method you try”.

177
00:16:22,276 --> 00:16:26,899
There is no need to do that also, because
of lack of discretion.

178
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,544
If you had discretion you would have known
that this is not to be done.

179
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:33,848
What is not to be done in Sahaja Yoga is
not to be done.

180
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:39,020
But how will you know when you have no
discretion, like a lost ship.

181
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:46,221
So then you have to see how your Mother
would act at such a position

182
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:51,836
and then I’m sure you’ll go beyond the cause
and the effect.

183
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:55,943
So today is the day I should also not say
anything

184
00:16:56,144 --> 00:17:00,789
that is in any way hurting to anyone

185
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,899
and I am trying to make you smile and laugh
but you are so serious.

186
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:14,709
So today we decide on peace. Peace with
ourselves, peace with others

187
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,517
and that is how we worship the sun, Christ,
the One who was the emblem,

188
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:28,925
who was the absolute practical symbol
of that peace.

189
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:37,082
And once you understand this, I am sure you
will try to follow that, instead of

190
00:17:37,283 --> 00:17:42,286
hitting everybody, getting angry with
everybody. Just forget all these things.

191
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:47,149
You have come here to ascend and your gain
is your gain.

192
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,452
Your fighting is not your gain, remember
that.

193
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:55,473
Your quarrelling is not your gain. The gain
is the peace that you have achieved,

194
00:17:55,674 --> 00:18:00,222
the love that you have developed,
the compassion that you can emit,

195
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:04,991
the amount of relationship and the rapport
you can penetrate into others.

196
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:08,876
This is your gain which we have to receive
today:

197
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:15,456
a mind, a heart like a lion, and not
chicken-hearted people.

198
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:21,374
Not people who would be angry and this,
to boast of your anger:

199
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:26,508
these days are gone, we boast of our peace,
we boast of our contentment,

200
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:33,331
we boast of our glory and we boast of our
state.

201
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:38,269
And that is the state where we are now
in the Kingdom of God.

202
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,540
May God bless you all!

203
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:47,810
(Then Shri Mataji continues in Marathi
for about 12 minutes)
