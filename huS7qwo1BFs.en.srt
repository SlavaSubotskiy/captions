1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:12,500
I am very happy to see so many people here
to know about Sahaja Yoga in all its details.

2
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:24,750
But in this short time, what can you be told?
That firstly you got your realization, you

3
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:37,769
felt the cool breeze all right, and that it
was an experience. But beyond this experience

4
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:49,550
you have to settle down. It is very, very
important that you must have desire to settle

5
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:00,200
down. You don’t know the importance of your
personality. You are the one who’ll save

6
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:11,610
this world. Because the salvation of the whole
world is not possible with Myself; and you

7
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:28,640
people who will be really developed, it will
be such a force. I told about England yesterday,

8
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,400
another thing is that England is the heart
of the universe, I think. Everything circulates

9
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:52,180
from here, whatever happens small or big,
it circulates. It is not that only England

10
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,840
has many newspapers or television centers
but somehow it circulates everywhere. I used

11
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,640
to think only in India, it’s not so. I’ve
seen everywhere, every country, there's news

12
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:19,200
about England. Even in America, even in South
America, I was surprised how people are worried

13
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:28,770
about England so much that they want to know
what’s happening in England. My own experience

14
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:36,849
is this, that they get so upset with the things
that upset your country, not only that but

15
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:48,379
anything that happens of a very small importance
is noted down and they always tell Me, “Mother,

16
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,769
we have seen in the newspaper, we have seen
in the television.”

17
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:06,769
America is such a vast country and also the
newspapers are vast, and their television

18
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:14,330
is impossible to gauge anything out of it.
Horrible. What they say also language wise,

19
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:21,640
we are not so good for American language.
So, they’re little exclusive people, I think

20
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:28,640
their idea is to be exclusive. For example,
if they produce anything electrical, it has

21
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:41,190
to have 110 watt, while normally people have
220, so nobody can buy their electrical productions.

22
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:49,980
Now they have started a small production of
that. They try to be exclusive, while I think

23
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,650
England is not like that, it’s not exclusive,
it’s not only keeping all its things to

24
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:03,650
itself. This is something, a very great quality
that England has. It has many other qualities,

25
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:18,700
as I told you yesterday, there has to be self-esteem.
One quality is that they never go to extremes.

26
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:28,400
I mean we had some hippies, we had little
bit of this and that, but they don’t go

27
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,400
to extremes. But in America or any other country,
if something starts it really blasts the whole

28
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,800
atmosphere. This balancing in England is something
really very surprising. Also they are disciplined

29
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:59,270
people, they have their own discipline, and
with their discipline, they… like people

30
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:06,270
who are disciplined, who are very much in
time, properly dressed for the occasion and

31
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,930
I’m not trying to just praise you, but this
is My observation. And in this observation

32
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:23,410
I find, once Sahaja Yoga settles down in England,
it will spread all over the world. Then I

33
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:30,270
don’t have to run about in every country.
That’s very important, that it should settle

34
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:37,270
down here, that is you should all understand
the importance of Sahaja Yoga.

35
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:46,750
When I first came to London, My husband had
a job and I started My work with seven people,

36
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:57,229
out of them I think five were hippies. But
immediately they got rid of their drugs, alcohols

37
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:08,460
and all that. Immediately. Next day they were
different people. But how to prove, how to

38
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:17,910
tell, was a problem. They improved so much,
unbelievable. And I felt very close to them

39
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:27,789
that they are the people who have achieved
it in such a short time. For which, I think

40
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:34,789
otherwise I have to work very hard for others.
They became hippies because of some sort of

41
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:41,990
a fashion maybe? But English don’t take
to fashions so much. I don’t know why. Why

42
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:49,810
they had become hippies, and they were very
well educated, all were professors, this,

43
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:56,620
that. And they said that we have taken to
this hippiedom because we wanted to experiment

44
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:03,620
as to what it is. I said “You can’t experiment
with a snake, that ‘let the snake bite us

45
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:12,740
and then we’ll experiment.’ Once it bites
you, you are finished.” All these things

46
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:21,020
have been always, kept Me attached to London
and I have been here for twenty years continuously.

47
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:33,330
But the work that we did, I don’t know why
it did not reach intellectuals, and newspaper

48
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:41,520
people, while all other stupid people who
came here were so much enamored, and were

49
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:49,229
given so much prominence, everybody was talking
about them. So that’s how the London is

50
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:03,199
based about Sahaja Yoga. It is a spontaneous
happening within, a spontaneous. Yesterday

51
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:12,690
you saw, I didn’t do anything, it just worked
spontaneously, because it is there and it

52
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,759
has to be awakened, that’s all. But I know
also people who have been cured, have been

53
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:28,610
completely cured of very difficult diseases
with Sahaja Yoga. It’s a fact, it’s not

54
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:36,890
just I’m boasting about it, but it’s a
fact. It’s a very powerful thing within

55
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:43,890
us. This power of Kundalini is extremely,
extremely kind, loving, affectionate and effective.

56
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:54,730
As I said it’s your Mother, and when it
acts, it works so well, it works so well.

57
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:04,130
It is impossible to avoid Kundalini awakening
once it has been awakened. But I know some

58
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:15,740
people who have been able to defy it, maybe
because of basically they were cheats or immoral

59
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:26,339
or some sort of people, but they were very,
very few. Mostly I have seen people have grown

60
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,459
to great heights with Sahaja Yoga.

61
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:40,459
Today I want to tell you a special thing about
Sahaja Yoga. That in Sahaja Yoga, slowly,

62
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,800
slowly you’ll find, most of your problems,
most of your, I should say enemies, as in

63
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:06,630
Sanskrit they are called shadripus, all these
will just disappear. You’ll be amazed, how

64
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:16,970
they are just disappearing. Jealousy, anger,
racism, all kinds of stupid things that are

65
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:28,320
lingering, of which you may not be even aware,
just drop out. And you feel such love and

66
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:38,390
such affection for everyone who comes across.
You try to give them Sahaja Yoga, you try

67
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,110
to tell them about Sahaja Yoga. They may like
it, they may not like it. English are little

68
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:53,110
conservative, so that conservatism has gone
a little bit sometimes, too much. There’s

69
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:01,700
no harm in talking about Sahaja Yoga. I have
seen people who have gurus, of the worst type,

70
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:08,470
worst type. One lady was sitting next to Me…

71
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:15,470
It’s quite warm today? They told Me it’s
very cold. That’s England [laughs]. It’s

72
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:27,920
cold or hot. The climate is whimsical, agreed.
Very whimsical, if you are going out, say,

73
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:39,769
we were living in Oxsted, 25 miles away, and
when I started from there it was, surprisingly,

74
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:48,560
it was absolutely clear sky. And by the time
I reached Victoria station, it was pouring

75
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:57,940
cats and dogs as you say. Horrible, I couldn’t
understand. Or vice versa. So the climate

76
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:07,510
is whimsical, but that makes you prepared
for every kind of climate, every kind of incident.

77
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:18,810
And you understand, that that is what is the
nature. We shouldn’t fight with the nature,

78
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:25,810
but we shouldn’t expect everything to be
absolutely first class when we are going out.

79
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:35,850
So this kind of taking risk has made you people
very courageous, I must say. Courageous. And

80
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:45,670
this courage is to be used now in Sahaja Yoga.
You have to use this for spreading Sahaja

81
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:53,610
Yoga. This is your mission. This is what you’ll
enjoy. You’ll be amazed, the more you spread,

82
00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:00,700
the higher you’ll go. You’ll develop much
more, much more powers within you, and unlimited

83
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,730
powers.

84
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:10,730
As far as miracles are concerned, I’m just
- don’t know how to explain them. Such miracles

85
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,360
take place. We had a lady from America, she
was staying with us and she had some sort

86
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:29,470
of a funny disease, that all her intestines
and stomach were all entangled with some sort

87
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:36,790
of a growth. And she had it before also. So
she had an operation and they took out everything.

88
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,720
Again she came to Cabella, and she was staying
there. Again she developed the same problems,

89
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,620
the same symptoms. She was quite worried.
So they said, “All right, we’ll take you

90
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:54,620
to the hospital.” She said, “No, let me
first meditate,” and with meditation, you’ll

91
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,639
be amazed, when she went to the hospital,
the doctor said “There is nothing, you’re

92
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:05,639
absolutely clear. You are cleared out.”
This meditation can help you in so many ways.

93
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:13,860
It’s not a meditation of some sort of a
chanting, or some sort of a going into, as

94
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:23,449
they said you’ll fly in the air or all those
things, no. It just is meditation by which

95
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:31,180
you enter within yourself. Your Kundalini
works out with this meditation. She looks

96
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:37,170
after your illness, she looks after about
your curing. All kinds of things she looks

97
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:44,170
after. Even the traffic you know, you’ll
be surprised, it works in so many ways. It

98
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:51,910
is so miraculous, you will find all the time
as if you are helped by some people, some

99
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:59,690
angels are there who are helping you. You’ll
be amazed at yourself, when it starts working

100
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:06,690
out. So, instead of doubting, you keep watching
what’s happening, how it works out. So many

101
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:13,899
things work out in such a beautiful manner,
that you are amazed, as if you have entered

102
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:20,899
into the kingdom of God. Which you have. All
the possible help, all the possible solutions,

103
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,130
just come like that.

104
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:32,130
I’ve seen one fellow who had some case on
him, and he told Me, “Mother, I have this

105
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:37,130
case, and this and that.” I said, “All
right, you meditate,” and when he went to

106
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:43,790
the court, they said that you’re already
solved, that thing is solved already. He was

107
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:50,790
amazed, “How is it solved? I never even
went to the court.” Then he went to the

108
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,829
lawyer, and the lawyer said, “Yes, they
have solved, but I don’t know how, because

109
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:03,949
I didn’t go to the court. I was sitting
with Mataji, I didn’t go to the court. But

110
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:09,990
your problem is solved, because when I went
to the court next day, they said it’s all

111
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,279
done.”
“But who was arguing the case?”

112
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,699
“They said you.”

113
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:19,730
“I? I was not arguing, so who was arguing
the case?”

114
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:26,660
“There was, and even you see, the remark
of the magistrate is this, that you argued

115
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,709
very well.”

116
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:34,709
It’s a fact, I’m not telling you stories,
it’s a fact, it happened. He said, “Mother,

117
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:41,769
did you go to argue the case?” I said, “I
am very bad at that, I do not know how to

118
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,769
argue.” But such wonderful things have happened,
I mean, you won’t believe, unbelievable

119
00:16:54,769 --> 00:17:01,769
things happen. And, it is just to be seen.
As I told you yesterday, you have to be in

120
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,399
the witness state.

121
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:11,399
Don’t you think that there’s anything
less or more with anybody. You are all there

122
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:18,350
and are looked after. But have faith in yourself
is the main point. If you don’t have faith

123
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:23,319
in yourself, it doesn’t work. Just have
faith in yourself. I’m not telling you just

124
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:30,319
tall stories, I tell you. It is the fact,
I Myself I’m amazed how things work out.

125
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:38,270
I’ll tell you about Dr Spiro, one day what
happened, interesting. You see, I had told

126
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:45,370
the boys not to go in the sun - in Indian
sun, you know?- after 10 o’clock. But they

127
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:53,690
wanted, I don’t know, to burn their skin
or whatever they wanted to do. Five, six boys

128
00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:01,450
were there, and when they came away, they
had all blisters all over in their hands.

129
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:09,690
So he said, they have to be given tetanus,
that has to be done and all that. I said,

130
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:18,720
“Don’t worry, it can be solved.” I just
took some water and a little cotton wool and

131
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:28,320
put it on them. And I was, as I was taking
it down, it all disappeared, it was all disappearing.

132
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:39,000
But I told them, that in the evening, go and
sit in the sea so your heat is taken out.

133
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I think they didn’t do it. I sent them My
saris to cover themselves. I said, “Take

134
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,059
these saris, cover yourselves, sleep with
them.”

135
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:57,059
After that, I went to My brother’s place
in Aurangabad. He was the judge of the high

136
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:04,860
court there. I went there and My brother came
and he said, “What has happened to Your

137
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:12,110
saris?” I said, “Why?” “See how many
big, big holes there are.” And I said “How

138
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,090
do you know?” He said, “These girls went
to take out Your sari for Your bath and there

139
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:22,020
are big, big holes all over.” All the saris
had those holes. So he said, “How will You

140
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,980
manage?” I said, “I’ll manage with one
sari, it doesn’t matter.” But, I just

141
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:33,700
remember these boys, the amount of heat they
had. They burnt the saris so badly. But they

142
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:39,980
were not aware of their heat, that was inside.
Though they were cured, the heat was inside.

143
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:46,950
Like this, there are many, many things that
have happened, and I don’t know how to explain

144
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,600
to you all these miracles.

145
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Now, why do these miracles are there? Why
there is these miraculous photographs? You

146
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:07,970
must have seen them. To convince people. They
were never convinced you see. Christ came,

147
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:16,049
He crucified Himself. Nobody was convinced
that He was divine. The problem is, human

148
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:24,460
mind is so stuck up that they cannot accept
anybody as divine. And at this time, in modern

149
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:33,960
times, when there are so many false gurus,
all kinds of things going on, I think it was

150
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,960
necessary for them to produce these miraculous
photographs. Actually, I don’t do anything,

151
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:47,960
to be very frank, I don’t do. It’s all
done by this all-pervading Power.

152
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:54,960
I was once in Brisbane in Australia and I
was sleeping, daytime, so one girl saw a beautiful

153
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:06,370
rainbow and she wanted to take a picture.
She took a picture of the rainbow, but can

154
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,919
you imagine a painting I love very much of
Raphael, of the Mother and the Child, I like

155
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:21,919
it very much. And she sees that thing on the
photograph. And the circular light that Raphaello

156
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:33,130
has shown was on top of Her head. I thought
Raphaello himself has painted or what has

157
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:40,059
happened? I couldn’t believe Myself. Like
this, so many things, so many things, you

158
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:47,059
can see one by one, some are they have collected,
some are not. Recently we had a program in

159
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:54,570
Bombay where we get at least 2 lakhs of people,
that means 200 000 people and they were all

160
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:09,360
preparing, arranging the stage, and in the
photograph, I’m already there. And with

161
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:17,730
Me is Ganesha sitting. Even Shri Ganesha’s
actual body, actual face was there in one

162
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:24,789
of the other pictures. I myself start wondering
what is all going on. This is the work of

163
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:31,679
Paramachaitanya, which is trying to convince
people who cannot be easily convinced. It’s

164
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:38,140
trying to make people understand that this
is divine, this is Divinity.

165
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,950
They never believed in Christ, they never
believed in anyone. All kinds of things they

166
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:49,950
have said about Christ, all sorts of things
they have tried to talk about Krishna, Rama.

167
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:57,940
But, still there are very few people who really
believe in them. They think it’s a myth.

168
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:05,669
But all these myths become real. You’ll
be amazed how you will change. You’ll start

169
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:20,580
looking so much younger first of all. Myself,
you know, I’m very good at recognizing people,

170
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:26,669
but some people I could not recognize. I said
“Are you the same?” “Yes.” So transformed,

171
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:33,669
the whole face changes, looking so much different.
One fellow was bald, he’s got all the hair

172
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,870
on his head. And what did he do? He said,
“No, Mother, I just raised my Kundalini,

173
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,940
that’s all.” “You didn’t do anything?”
“No, no, I didn’t do anything.” And

174
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,539
he had become so bald, so much bald headed,
that in the passport, his photograph was there,

175
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:58,539
and when the passport fellow saw him he said,
“You?” Because he was bald-headed at that

176
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:07,820
time, but he had hair before, but now, his
hair has come back. Unbelievable things have

177
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:14,990
happened. Unbelievable. And all this is for
you. You’re in for it. You can have many,

178
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,529
many miracles.

179
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:26,529
My, another name is also Daisy, because My
mother was very fond of a teacher, her name

180
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:35,909
was Daisy, apart from this, she gave Me the
name of Daisy. Now, when I came to England,

181
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:40,710
I found daisies everywhere, but they had no
fragrance, no fragrance. We don’t get daisies

182
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:47,710
in India, you will be surprised. But then,
they got fragrance. All daisies got fragrance,

183
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:56,230
very surprising. They never had fragrance
and they started smelling very well, in a

184
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:04,850
very beautiful manner. So it works also in
the nature somehow. I mean, that nature should

185
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:11,990
know My name is Daisy, that this - it’s
remarkable. There’s no end to it.

186
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,720
So many angels and so many divine vibrations
are working it out. So I have to first tell

187
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:28,419
you that you must have faith in yourself,
very important, and you must meditate. Once

188
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:35,419
you start meditating, you’ll become masters
of Sahaja Yoga. For this, color is no bar,

189
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:43,850
religion no bar, race no bar, nothing. As
long as you are a human being and you have

190
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:52,659
got your realization, you can really go very
far. So many miracles have happened to Sahaja

191
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:02,510
Yogis, so many miracles. And I was surprised,
even when they write to Me, they say Mother,

192
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:09,010
nobody will believe, but this is what has
happened to us. So, I would request you to

193
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:15,919
have faith in yourself and do meditation.
Very important. Then the growth within, you’ll

194
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:22,919
be amazed. I have seen people who never wrote
any single line are great poets. Those who

195
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:31,620
could not stand on the dais to speak have
become great orators. So many people have

196
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:39,110
achieved so much. But I just told them, don’t
talk about it, if you talk about it they’ll

197
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,130
think we are telling some sort of a story.
It’s a fact. Now you also find out in your

198
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:53,130
own life, the experience of all these changes
that take place. How the relationships change.

199
00:26:53,850 --> 00:27:00,309
There was one fellow in America, very rich
man, and he told Me, “I don’t know what

200
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:06,289
You did to me.” I said, “What happened?”
“See, I hated my cousin, I really hated

201
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:08,890
him, but the other day I saw him and I felt
like hugging him. And I kissed him so he started

202
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,159
looking at me, what’s gone wrong with me?”
You see, like, you change so enjoy now, you

203
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,720
enjoy the collectivity. Now in India we have
a seminar of Sahaja Yogis. You see we have

204
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,770
people from all over the world. We have from
Brazil, from Argentina, say from England,

205
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,039
also Spain, everywhere. Russia, such a lot
from Russia. And when they meet, I’ve never

206
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,409
heard anybody quarrelling or hitting or anything.
They are in thousands, last time we had ten

207
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:26,409
thousand, but I’ve never seen anybody - but
such understanding and love. Of course, they

208
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:33,679
pull each other’s legs, that’s true, as
friends, but on the whole there’s never

209
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:41,470
a fight, never a quarrel. Can you imagine
if this thing happened to the whole world?

210
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:48,679
All these wars that they have started, all
this kind of problems they have created in

211
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:56,990
the name of God, in the name of land, or whatever
it is, will be finished. This should happen,

212
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:07,289
this should happen to the whole world, and
I want this world to be a very happy and a

213
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:14,659
beautiful place. And I’m sure you all can
achieve it. Because of you, the vibrations

214
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:21,659
will spread. Vibrations of love, vibrations
of compassion.

215
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:30,330
We have also a great idea of having compassion
for the people who are suffering. So I’ve

216
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:36,289
started a hospital which is very successful,
and we don’t have to charge anything except

217
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:43,289
for what they have to pay for their food and
stay. And it’s working wonders. What has

218
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:50,710
happened? What has happened, how is it working
like that? It is nothing but sheer divine

219
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:58,970
power. We have another hospital now we are
starting in Delhi, and also destitute women,

220
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:06,100
and it’s surprising how things work out.
There was a lady who came and complained about

221
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:12,520
her husband. That he has been very unkind
to her and this and that. I said “All right,

222
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:19,149
once we have destitute women’s home you
come there.” Amazing, the husband came next

223
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:26,149
day and she tells Me, “Mother, he’s became
a very nice man now. He’s become very nice.”

224
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:33,480
“Really?” He didn’t come to meditation,
he didn’t get his realization, how has he

225
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:41,110
become so nice? How suddenly he has become
so nice to his wife? It’s really unbelievable

226
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:46,809
how it acts. I tell you, we don’t know,
this all-pervading power is the power of love.

227
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:53,809
God is Truth, but Truth is Love. Love not
biased, love not because there is some sort

228
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:06,159
of a gain or some relationship, but love which
is just love. The ocean of love, and you’ll

229
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:14,490
just start enjoying that ocean. I have seen
it Myself happening and you also should see.

230
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:21,700
Whenever is possible please come to Cabella
at least, is in Italy. There you can see.

231
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:27,980
And we have nothing but a hangar, and they
didn’t want Me to build anything for them.

232
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:34,980
I said in the hangar how do you live? “That’s
the best Mother, we want to live in the camp.

233
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:46,950
We don’t want to live in rooms. We have
had enough of it.” Imagine, Russians, Americans,

234
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:55,289
all of them in such beautiful enjoyment. I
tell you, we have to enjoy life. God has not

235
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,649
created us to weep and cry, but to enjoy.
It’s good for you, it’s good for your

236
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:08,649
children, good for your family, good for your
nation and for the whole world. As I told

237
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:17,549
you that you are important because from England
everything circulates, circulates, circulates.

238
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:24,730
So, how important you are in Sahaja Yoga I’m
just trying to tell you. Very important and

239
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:31,929
you can do a lot. One person went to Russia
and now we have thousands of Russian Sahaja

240
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:39,370
Yogis. Thousands of them, they are so dedicated,
so beautiful, you can’t imagine. Once I

241
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:48,980
was in Moscow when this coup took place and
big problem was there. So I asked the Sahaja

242
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,950
Yogis, “Aren’t you worried about this
coup that has taken place?” “Which coup,

243
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:03,279
Mother?” I said, “Which you had in Moscow.“
“Mother, we don’t live in Moscow, we live

244
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,799
in the Kingdom of God.”

245
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:12,799
Just imagine. So when you face reality you
are enamored, you are just filled with joy,

246
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:26,149
because reality is joy. Today’s function,
I have never attended before like this. But

247
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:31,380
they said “Mother, You should come” so
I’ve tried to make it, but I would like

248
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,870
you to ask Me questions now. It’s very important,
if you have any doubts, please ask, or if

249
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:41,200
you have anything to say, please ask. Thank
you.

250
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,919
No questions?

251
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,809
Q. Shri Mataji, what do you think of Buddhism?

252
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:53,809
A. Now see, Buddhism is very different from
Buddha. Absolutely. Buddha first got his realization.

253
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:04,480
First he became a Buddha and then he started
Buddha religion. But the way people are doing

254
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:08,779
Buddhism is the other way round. That you
give up your wife, you give up your children,

255
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:15,779
you give up even your dress, everything. To
whom? To these people. Buddha started after

256
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:28,149
his realization. After your realization only
you can become Buddha, means a realized soul.

257
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:38,570
And he said it the same way. He said Buddham
Sharanam Gachami, I surrender myself to other

258
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:46,929
realized souls, Buddham Sharanam Gachami.
Then he said Sangham Sharanam Gachami, Dharmam

259
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:57,470
Sharanam Gachami, I surrender myself to the
religion which is within me, innate religion.

260
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:06,909
And thirdly he says, Sangham Sharanam Gachami,
I surrender myself to the collective.

261
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:20,179
This nonsense of giving up this, giving up
that, I mean, it’s too much. If you are

262
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:29,510
holding onto something then you can give up.
If you are not holding onto anything then

263
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:33,810
what are you going to give up? Simple thing
like that, for example, in Canada, one fellow

264
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:40,810
came wearing that Buddhist’s dress. I don’t
like it. A Sahaja Yogi said “You’d better

265
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:48,790
go and change, Mother will not give you realization
if you are wearing this dress.”

266
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:58,829
So he came to Me and, “Mother, please forgive
me, I have no other dress left.”

267
00:34:58,829 --> 00:34:59,210
I said, “Why?”

268
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,900
“I have lost everything.” He was a big
business man. “I’ve lost everything, I’ve

269
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:09,900
given away to the Buddhists and I’m left
with two pair of these clothes and if you

270
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:17,480
don’t give me realization, what will I do?”

271
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,670
“Really?”

272
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,589
“Yes.”

273
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:23,089
So, what is there to give up is the point,
what is there to give up? If you are not holding

274
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:29,119
onto anything what are you going to give up?
Simple thing like that. Buddha never gave

275
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:36,119
up his clothes, nothing of the kind. But he
wanted to find out, what is the truth. So

276
00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:43,359
he went round, I mean he tried his level best
and everything, ultimately his Kundalini rose

277
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,800
and he got the realization. But what he was
doing there, he was just lying down under

278
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:56,800
a banyan tree. Now, whatever mistakes he has
committed, we need not do, that you give up

279
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:05,010
your wife, you give up your child, give up
this, give up that. Just the 
contrast of what really Buddha achieved, is

280
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:15,390
the contrast of that. So Buddhism is not Buddha
by any chance.

281
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Q. The gentleman wants to know what happens
after we die, Mother?

282
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:44,930
A. Now, that’s another point. Everybody
worried about what will happen if we die.

283
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:52,420
I would say that, as a Sahaja Yogi, you should
not worry about the future because it doesn’t

284
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:57,609
exist. You shouldn’t worry about your past
because it’s finished. You should be in

285
00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:04,180
the presence which is the reality. Present
is the reality. What’s the use if I tell

286
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:10,190
you what will happen, you’ll become a bird
or anything, are you going to believe Me?

287
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:15,250
You shouldn’t.

288
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:22,250
Q. Could you tell us about angels Shri Mataji?

289
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:38,290
A. They are very beautiful, just like flowers,
very fragrant. And they will help you; you’ll

290
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:54,910
be amazed how they’ll help you. You won’t
see them, you don’t see them. But they are

291
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:04,579
there, in the form of some human being - in
so many ways. So you cannot describe them

292
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:18,180
because you can’t see them. But you’ll
see their help, and you’ll be amazed how

293
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:25,180
they guide you to the right path. Now, supposing
you lose your way somewhere, don’t get frustrated,

294
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:33,940
don’t get upset about it. If you have lost
your way it must be some purpose. On that

295
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,230
way when you go you’ll find somebody whom
you have been looking for ages, or maybe some

296
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:45,290
sort of a thing you’ll find, some treasure
you’ll find. So, if you have lost your way,

297
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:52,290
there’s nothing to worry. They work very
smoothly and sweetly.

298
00:38:53,359 --> 00:39:00,359
Q. She’s asking how you begin to meditate,
Shri Mataji.

299
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:16,470
A. That of course they will tell you. There’s
a photograph of Mine, first you have to work

300
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:24,440
on that. Afterwards you will know that how
it works, but first you have to use My photograph,

301
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:31,890
I don’t know what to do because the photograph
has the vibrations. You can test it, you’ll

302
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:38,890
get tremendous vibrations from the photograph.
It’s a kind, as we can call, a figure, which

303
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:45,740
emits vibrations. I do not gain anything by
that, but you will gain. You will gain, so

304
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:52,740
you have to sit down and meditate before the
photograph. It’s full of vibrations. It’s

305
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:02,520
so effective I tell you, that when you put
these photographs of Mine all over London,

306
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:10,930
it works.

307
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:19,670
Q. Is prayer the same as meditation?

308
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:32,069
A. See, before you are connected to the Divine,
what is your prayer? It’s nothing. If you

309
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:42,380
telephone without the connection, what is
it? So after realization, the prayer very

310
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:49,380
much helps. But meditation is inner, prayer
is outside. For your inner growth, meditation

311
00:40:54,310 --> 00:41:01,240
is necessary. You don’t have to spend too
much time, say about in the evening before

312
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:08,240
sleeping, if you can do it for about say ten
minutes, or maybe five minutes in the morning,

313
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:16,910
that’s very good.

314
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:23,910
Q. Sahaja Yoga is available to everybody,
is it even available to politicians, Mother?

315
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:45,940
A. I mean, you know, you’ll be surprised,
in India so many politicians have come to

316
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:59,400
Sahaja Yoga. In India. But I don’t know
about English politicians. I have met some,

317
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:07,030
but they are so much involved into their own
positions and things. So far none of them,

318
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:17,339
but if you can grab some people it’s a good
idea.

319
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:30,119
Q. The gentleman asks for your personal blessing
Shri Mataji, he wants your personal blessing.

320
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:49,700
A. May God bless you, may God bless you. It
is for everyone. It’s for everyone.

321
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:03,680
Q. What is the difference between the soul
and the spirit.

322
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:10,680
A. The soul and the spirit? It’s a subject
should be dealt later on but little in short

323
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:20,050
I’ll tell you. The soul is the essence,
essence of the five elements. Essence. For

324
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:33,940
example, for Mother Earth, the essence is
fragrance, so all these five elements have

325
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:45,010
essence, and this essence contains the soul
in the sense that the soul is the reflection

326
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:52,010
of God Almighty within us. So the body is
that of the five elements, the essence of

327
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:06,619
the five elements and the spirit is the one
which is reflected on it, that is the reflection

328
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:19,569
of God Almighty. But later on you’ll know
much more.

329
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:36,530
Q. Mother he wants to know if You still meditate
Yourself?

330
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,510
A. I am in meditation all the time.

331
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:49,510
(A gentleman starts to speak for a very long
time, Shri Mataji says “It’s a big lecture.”)

332
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:40,520
Q. He wants to know, there are different meditations
he says, and he’s confused, Mother.

333
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:10,329
A. Meditation cannot be different, it has
to be one, and the one that makes you deep

334
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:26,970
is the meditation. All kinds of meditation,
there was one meditation they had started

335
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:34,180
here by which you will start moving three
feet higher than normal. Now think of it,

336
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:43,890
already we have traffic jams. You can find
the stupidity in all of them. If you use your

337
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:58,170
intelligence, you’ll find out, because you
don’t grow. Meditation that is good is the

338
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:05,520
one by which you grow. Everything is not the
food. The food that you can eat is the food.

339
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:28,680
Q. What do you think about Islam Mother?

340
00:47:31,569 --> 00:47:38,569
A. Islam is great, no doubt. But nobody follows
Islam. Nobody follows, nobody has read even

341
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:46,640
Koran. You’ll be amazed. They are fighting
without understanding what Islam has written.

342
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:53,640
Mohammed Sahib was one of the incarnations
of the real Gurus, but Muslims, stupid as

343
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:01,079
they are, they don’t follow. They don’t
follow the exact sayings of Koran. Now in

344
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:08,079
Koran is written, that at the time of resurrection
your hands will speak. See? And without that

345
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:19,349
you cannot be Muslim, I mean Muslim means
surrendered. Just imagine, it’s all Sahaja

346
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:26,349
Yoga, if you can read between the lines. We
have a book called as “Koran Enlightened,”

347
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:38,770
we have also “Bible Enlightened,” we have
“Gita Enlightened.” All right?

348
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:57,559
Q. He says he finds it difficult to meditate
because his mind is wandering. How to control

349
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,069
the mind Mother?

350
00:49:15,069 --> 00:49:22,069
A. Never control. Don’t try to control it.
There’s no need to control. Your Kundalini

351
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:32,809
itself will give you thoughtless awareness,
She’ll work it out. Try on the photograph,

352
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:44,490
it will work out.

353
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:51,490
Q. It’s a request Mother, will you come
to Ireland one day?

354
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:07,400
A. Oh, of course! They are lost, fighting
among themselves. But I have a special feeling

355
00:50:16,819 --> 00:50:23,369
for Ireland. Because of ignorance, complete
ignorance, now the Catholics were fighting

356
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:30,079
Protestants, now Protestants are fighting
each other, now Catholics will start fighting

357
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:37,079
each other. I don’t want to say anything,
but you must understand that all these religions

358
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:46,510
have created nothing but fighting mongerers.
Crucified Christ and how can you think of

359
00:50:51,099 --> 00:50:58,099
fighting? All over the world there’s fight
in the name of God. Can you imagine the stupidity?

360
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:09,940
Irish are very nice people, very simple, but
they get lost into these different, different

361
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:24,089
ideas. Actually, religion should never make
you fight, but the religions have misled them,

362
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:35,470
the religions have misled them, all right?
We have to give them that real religion of

363
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:43,270
within. Innate religion. In Italy they started
an argument with Me and they said, “We don’t”

364
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,809
- ultimately, they said, “We don’t want
to have one religion for the whole world.”

365
00:51:54,809 --> 00:52:01,730
I said, “Why? Because then you can’t fight,
isn’t it?” You want to have many religions

366
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:08,730
so you can nicely fight with each other. Like
Rwanda and all these people. Religion must

367
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:17,770
bring peace, joy, otherwise what’s the use
of having any religion?

368
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:24,770
Q. Will you one day come to Scotland, Mother?

369
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:33,390
A. Scotland I have been. I have been to Scotland,
but, the problem was, at about 12 o’clock

370
00:52:54,150 --> 00:53:01,150
everybody was drunk.

371
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:11,530
Q. Can Sahaja Yoga change your fate, change
your karma, change your destiny? Can Sahaja

372
00:53:24,609 --> 00:53:25,730
Yoga change it?

373
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:32,730
A. Your karmas are finished. After Sahaja
Yoga, your karmas are finished. And can change

374
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:39,730
your face also, but why do you want to change
your face? - Fate, fate!! I thought she wanted

375
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:53,859
to change…. Ah, of course, of course it
can. It can change your fate and all your

376
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:07,440
aspirations are changed. Then you just want
to spread Sahaja Yoga, and enjoy the company

377
00:54:09,809 --> 00:54:16,809
of Sahaja Yogis.

378
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:25,720
Q. He is a student Mother, how can Sahaja
Yoga help with being a student, with education?

379
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:41,510
A. Very much. For student, it’s a blessing
I say. Do you know, Sahaja Yogis who have

380
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:49,260
been very bad students, have stood first,
have got first class, first all over the world

381
00:54:49,549 --> 00:54:55,180
Sahaja Yogis are doing so well in their studies
because you get a clear cut vision. It’s

382
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,200
tremendous, for students it’s very good.

383
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:03,200
Q. Is it important to be a vegetarian Mother?

384
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:10,780
A. Not at all. You see, in Sahaja Yoga we
don’t eat animals which are bigger than

385
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:28,490
us and you need not eat animals in case you
are a person who requires more vegetables.

386
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:35,490
So it depends on your constitution. Now supposing
a person who is vegetarian and gets diarrhea,

387
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:45,799
he should stop. I’m not a vegetarian.

388
00:55:54,849 --> 00:56:01,849
Q. He’s got a problem with his knees.

389
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:19,670
A. Can be cured. Knee problems can be cured.
And how and when, that’s what, you have

390
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:27,980
to see these people and they will tell you
how to cure it. It can be cured. It is related

391
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:43,130
to your chakras.

392
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:52,470
Q. She says You travel a lot, do You fall
sick? You travel all over the world, to different

393
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,809
climates, do You fall sick?

394
00:57:11,809 --> 00:57:18,250
A. No, no. You see, people while they are
traveling, they think they are traveling,

395
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:25,250
that’s why they get sick. I never think.
I think I’m sitting nicely on a coach and

396
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:36,619
also they think that, when will they reach,
will there be people or not, worried about

397
00:57:44,859 --> 00:57:51,859
that, or maybe their past things they are
worried. I am not. I don’t get sick.

398
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:12,079
Q. Another request, Shri Mataji, when will
you go to South Africa?

399
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:18,650
A. You know the problem was like this, that
on My passport it was written that Indians

400
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:25,579
cannot. Because I am a diplomat, diplomatic
thing, we cannot go to South Africa. Now they

401
00:58:25,579 --> 00:58:32,579
have removed, so after that I will try to.

402
00:58:33,549 --> 00:58:40,549
Q. He says, Shri Mataji, that he lives in
South Africa and You are very far away physically,

403
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:51,740
but he feels that You are there, helping him,
why is that?

404
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:58,740
A. That’s My attention. I really want to
go to South Africa. I’ve been trying, but

405
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:04,640
I haven’t got the permission. And now I’ve
got the permission, definitely I’ll go.

406
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:11,640
And when you don’t have permission you are
more concerned about that country, isn’t

407
00:59:14,609 --> 00:59:17,900
it?

408
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:24,900
Q. What do you think about entities, bad spirits
Mother, earth-bound spirits?

409
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:33,940
A. They are, no doubt. They are there. But
you don’t worry, you don’t have them.

410
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:45,329
Q. Is there any similarity that we know of
between Sahaja Yoga and ancient Egyptian or

411
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:08,829
African religions?

412
01:00:08,829 --> 01:00:15,829
A. In Africa, I was surprised that they have
talked about Kundalini. They have, and I have

413
01:00:16,589 --> 01:00:23,589
seen some of the maps, old maps, of Africa,
they have made the picture of Kundalini also,

414
01:00:27,329 --> 01:00:34,329
all over. Even in a place like Bolivia, which
is so far away, and somebody went to Bolivia

415
01:00:36,859 --> 01:00:42,420
from Italy and he said, “Mother they know
everything about Kundalini.” I said, “Really?”

416
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:49,420
“Yes, they know, but they don’t know how
to awaken it.” And Sahaja Yoga has spread

417
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:57,440
so much in Bolivia, the Minister from there
came to see Me. And who told them? I said,

418
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:03,210
“Who told you?” They said, “There were
two saints who came from India.” Even in

419
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:09,770
Ukraine, I was surprised, they said, “There
were two saints who came here from India,

420
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:16,770
they told us about Kundalini.” Chinese people,
they believe that there is a treasure of spirituality

421
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:23,930
in India but they don’t know what it is,
you see. But these two I don’t know who

422
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:27,780
they were. Two saints known as Machindranath
and Goraknath who have been traveling all

423
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:34,780
over the world. I don’t know if they went
all the way over there.

424
01:01:37,809 --> 01:01:44,809
Q. A question about Paramahansa Yogananda,
he’s quite famous here because of his book.

425
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:55,020
A. He’s famous? What has he done? What has
he done? Writing a funny book like that, that’s

426
01:01:56,510 --> 01:02:02,809
all. I don’t want to discuss, but first
when you ask about somebody, you’ll have

427
01:02:02,809 --> 01:02:06,490
to tell Me what he has done.

428
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:13,490
Q. The gentleman set up a “Self Realization
Fellowship” in America.

429
01:02:19,809 --> 01:02:26,809
A. I know many in America who have done it,
and they are more difficult to get Self-realization.

430
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:35,619
There’s a big organization there, and they
all believe they are Self-realized, but they

431
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:40,549
don’t know any vibrations, they can’t
feel anything, and when they have been to

432
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:47,549
that organization, I find it difficult to
give them realization. In the name of God,

433
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:53,710
in the name of Self-realization if you spoil
the Kundalini of people, I don’t know what

434
01:02:53,710 --> 01:03:00,710
to say about them.

435
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:11,460
Q. Is it possible to meditate for the benefit
of other people?

436
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:37,980
A. In meditation you don’t think of anything.
See, you have to become thoughtless, that

437
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:44,490
is meditation. And for other people, you can
always ask, you are yourself protected, and

438
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:51,490
there are ways they’ll tell you how to work
out for others. See, they’ll tell you later

439
01:03:58,059 --> 01:03:58,859
on.

440
01:03:58,859 --> 01:04:05,859
Q. Shri Mataji, will peace, complete peace,
ever exist on the planet?

441
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:15,170
A. I wish that, I very much wish that, but
it depends on you people. How much you work

442
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:15,430
it out.

443
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:22,430
Q. He wants to know if there is any connection
between the work that You do and the work

444
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:56,990
that Sai Baba does?

445
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:00,930
A. Which Sai Baba?

446
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:05,839
Q. This modern fellow, Mother.

447
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:12,839
A. Well. I mean, giving diamonds and this
and that. Shirdi Sai Nath is correct, Shirdi

448
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:23,680
Sai Nath of course, but not this one. People
who want diamonds can go to him, baba I can’t

449
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,359
give diamonds.

450
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:34,359
Q. Are there more people becoming Self-realized,
or less people?

451
01:05:40,539 --> 01:05:47,539
A. Much more. It’s increasing, much more.
I told you I started with one lady and in

452
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:57,930
England with seven, now look at them.

453
01:05:58,099 --> 01:06:05,099
Q. If someone develops astral projection,
by accident Mother, and they feel bad, what

454
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,069
can they do?

455
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:16,920
A. They will get rid of it if they become
realized people, because you’re protected.

456
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,609
It’s very dangerous to have that astral
nonsense.

457
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:20,109
Q. The gentleman is interested in Your experience
with Mahatma Gandhi?

458
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:22,940
A. Mahatma Gandhi was My disciple. You’ll
be amazed. And he told Me, let our country

459
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:28,660
become free, and in that freedom then you
can start your Sahaja Yoga. Then we had Lal

460
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:34,730
Bahadur Shastri, who understood Me and he
said, of course, let me come back from Pakistan,

461
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:41,730
he had gone to Russia for Pakistan problem.
He never came back.

462
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:56,220
Q. He said yesterday Shri Mataji, You said
you may feel cool under the hands, he wants

463
01:07:06,049 --> 01:07:08,160
to know why, what it is?

464
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:15,160
A. It is, you should take it up you see, it
has some reasons, but I don’t want to tell

465
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:37,470
that. You just take it up there like that.

466
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:51,270
Q. What do You think about healing? There
are all different kinds of healing, what do

467
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:52,549
You think about the healing?

468
01:07:52,549 --> 01:07:59,010
A. Healing should be done with full understanding
of Kundalini. Any other healing can result

469
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:06,010
into something else. So be careful.

470
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:16,940
Q. Is it true that with Sahaja Yoga your immune
system improves so that you protect yourself

471
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:29,699
against disease?

472
01:08:29,699 --> 01:08:36,299
A. Of course. Immune system absolutely gets
cured, no doubt, and many problems of immune

473
01:08:36,299 --> 01:08:39,449
system also get cured. But also, you are protected.

474
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:46,449
Q. Another request Shri Mataji, when will
You come to Malaysia?

475
01:08:51,219 --> 01:08:58,219
A. I have been, I have been many a time. I
have been there, and the Chinese are coming

476
01:09:00,699 --> 01:09:07,699
to Sahaja Yoga, but Indians, I don’t know
what to say about them.

477
01:09:09,029 --> 01:09:16,029
Q. He’s asking Shri Mataji if you will guide
us into a meditation now? There are some people

478
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:23,239
here who were not at the Royal Albert Hall,
Mother.

479
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:26,630
A. I see. But are there any questions left?

480
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:33,630
Q. He said he has read in a book that it can
be dangerous to awaken to Kundalini, so do

481
01:09:46,069 --> 01:09:47,460
you need a teacher, Mother?

482
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:51,960
A. That’s very true, there have been people
who wrote like this. But those who wrote,

483
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:57,780
just go and see their lives, what they have
been up to. You see, you have to be a master,

484
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:02,980
otherwise you can’t do it. Then it’s not
the Kundalini, but a Deity there, which gets

485
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:09,980
annoyed, and then it happens. It’s not Kundalini.

486
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Q. What do you think of Ayurveda?

487
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:26,120
A. Quite good. Ayurveda is quite good, because
it deals with the three doshas and it’s

488
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:36,190
very near Sahaja Yoga. But with Sahaja Yoga
you get cured yourself, so you don’t need

489
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,130
anything much.

490
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:44,130
Q. He says he’s impressed by the fact that
Sahaja Yoga is free, but he thinks it sounds

491
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:13,070
too easy, he doesn’t feel that he’s completely
Self-realized, Mother? He says he feels the

492
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:20,480
cool breeze, but he thinks there must be more
work to do?

493
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:28,949
A. Yes, that’s true but I must say, but
are you an Italian? Are you an Italian?

494
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:33,030
Irish.

495
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:40,030
Because the way he was speaking I thought
he was Italian you see. I went to Italy and

496
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:50,000
I didn’t know, we were told not to use our
hands, and in Italy you see, they will go

497
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,080
on like this, like that. And they say something,
you don’t know what they are saying, but

498
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:58,699
their hands are moving in different, different
directions. So I thought he was Italian. All

499
01:11:58,699 --> 01:12:00,239
right, what was his question?

500
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:07,239
He says it sounds too easy, he thinks there
must be more work to do.

501
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:19,360
It is very easy to get realization, but to
settle with it, you have to do meditation,

502
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:26,070
and you’ll find out what’s wrong with
you. You’ll find out what chakras are catching

503
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:31,260
on your fingertips, and then try to improve
that.

504
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:38,260
Q. Can Sahaja Yoga help with psychiatric problems,
with mental problems?

505
01:12:54,790 --> 01:13:01,790
A. Of course, of course it can. Very much
it can help.

506
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:17,310
Q. Do you think that the world is a better
place? Are things improving?

507
01:13:30,909 --> 01:13:37,909
A. They can. With Sahaja Yoga it will, definitely
improve. If human beings improve, world will

508
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:48,429
improve also.

509
01:13:48,429 --> 01:13:55,429
Q. Shri Mataji, he is Italian and he is using
his hands!

510
01:14:08,429 --> 01:14:15,020
A. Yes, they are very expressive you know
[laughs].

511
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:22,020
Q. Shri Mataji, his question is, is it possible
to raise your Kundalini when you are a child

512
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:24,600
by accident?

513
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:30,320
A. No. There are children who are born realized.
There are children. And you can raise their

514
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:36,290
Kundalini also, it’s very much easier to
raise the Kundalini of children, you can do

515
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:43,150
that. So, it’s not an accident, it is just,
it’s there, they are born like that. They

516
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:49,440
are special people, many people who are married
in Sahaja Yoga have got very great saints

517
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:56,440
born to them. I have a great grandson who
is another realized soul, you know. So when

518
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:06,150
nobody is there, he will sit before Me and
do like this. (Shri Mataji holds open Her

519
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:13,750
hands) He’s not even two, but he speaks
so much, he can count from one to twenty and

520
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:23,800
it’s tremendous.

521
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:30,800
Now, one thing I’ll say, if you ask one
question it should be sufficient, all right.

522
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:44,280
Q. Krishnamurti, Shri Mataji?

523
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:51,280
A. Loaded with thoughts. Another are Krishnamurtis,
they can’t get realization so fast I tell

524
01:15:56,739 --> 01:16:03,739
you. So much have put in their brain. The
Kundalini has to cross the brain. But so much

525
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:12,239
in the limbic area, that’s My experience.

526
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:29,320
Q. He’s heard on a tape Shri Mataji that
you said that you are always in dreams, in

527
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:38,140
a dream state.

528
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:45,140
A. No, not at all. I actually don’t get
any dreams. I might have said it’s My dream

529
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:56,590
to see the world like this. It’s become
a fashion now to say that, isn’t it? “It’s

530
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:58,310
My dream.”

531
01:16:58,310 --> 01:17:05,310
Q. How did you come to this Realization Shri
Mataji?

532
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:20,770
A. I was born like that. I was born.

533
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:38,080
Q. Why is there a difference, why are we all
not born Self-realized? Why is it so difficult

534
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,739
for people?

535
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:47,739
A. It depends on your past life. Your desires,
if they are unfulfilled, then you get a life

536
01:17:54,870 --> 01:18:01,870
where you are fulfilled. Like, I know, I’ll
tell you one thing, I had a driver who was

537
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:07,219
very royal by temperament, and he was a royal
king you see. But he had to work very hard,

538
01:18:07,219 --> 01:18:14,219
so he was desiring he should become like his
chariot driver so that he’ll have some rest.

539
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:21,260
So he became a driver. Also marriage, and
all these things are responsible, because

540
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:27,489
we should not have any earnest desire, then
it acts.

541
01:18:27,489 --> 01:18:34,489
Q. In order to get Self-realization, do you
have to desire it Mother?

542
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:59,590
A. Of course. I cannot force. I cannot force.

543
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:12,810
Q. Another question Shri Mataji. What do you
think about Chinmoy?

544
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:20,270
A. Ah. You see, if you ask such questions
I don’t know how to answer because it’s

545
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:32,350
very embarrassing. What has he done? That’s
the only question you should ask. And moreover,

546
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:39,719
if you have been to all these it will be difficult
for you to get your Self-realization.

547
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:52,090
Q. Shri Mataji, is it possible that the Kundalini
can be damaged? And what happens if the Kundalini

548
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:22,120
is damaged already?

549
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:29,120
A. I don’t know. So far, I have seen that
so many of these false gurus and false people

550
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:36,320
have damaged the Kundalini of people. And
I have seen their Kundalini has been like

551
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:48,940
a snake, you would say, hurt. Difficult, but
you can mend it. If the desire is great, you

552
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:59,060
can mend it. But I’ve seen that, in some
people, the Kundalini is very much injured.

553
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:09,870
Q. Do you have to believe in God Mother?

554
01:21:13,949 --> 01:21:20,949
A. Not necessarily. Whether you believe or
not, He is there.

555
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:33,590
Q. Mother, one of Your names is Moksha Pradayini,
what is Moksha, what does it mean?

556
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,239
A. All these names I’ll explain to you later
on, just now they’ll be all shocked with

557
01:21:56,239 --> 01:22:03,239
this. It means the giver of Self-realization.

558
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:10,650
Q. She’s worried about the subconscious.
If we are trying to get into balance, how

559
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:44,880
can we ignore the subconscious?

560
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:57,639
A. It settles down by itself. You see, the
idea of subconscious is not like Jung. Subconscious

561
01:23:05,449 --> 01:23:12,449
is on the left hand side. And supraconscious
right side. The Kundalini is in the center.

562
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:21,590
So you don’t have to worry about subconscious
part, it just disappears.

563
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:30,670
Q. Is it wrong to have desires for other things,
apart from self-realization?

564
01:23:42,739 --> 01:23:49,739
A. No, there’s nothing wrong or right. You
don’t have, you don’t have any desire.

565
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:58,040
You just become so sweet. You don’t have
any desires as such. Wrong and right is not

566
01:23:59,739 --> 01:24:06,060
there, it’s just you don’t have. I would
say, I have one desire, to now stop questioning.

567
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:13,060
It is now about 10 o’clock, and we should
have our, again, the experience of the Self.

568
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:36,250
So you sit comfortably with your hands towards
Me like that. And no more questioning, allow

569
01:24:36,699 --> 01:24:43,699
your mind to rest, allow it. Now put your
hands towards Me please. Now, close your eyes,

570
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:15,360
please close your eyes. You can raise your
left hand on top of your fontanel bone area,

571
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:22,530
which was the soft bone in your childhood.
Just stop thinking, just stop thinking, by

572
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:36,210
saying “Not this, not this, not this.”
Now, please raise your right hand, and left

573
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:09,860
hand towards Me. Raise your right hand on
top of the fontanel bone area. Now, please

574
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:44,110
open your eyes and see for yourself if there’s
a cool or a hot breeze coming through your

575
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:58,060
fingertips, or on your palm, or out of your
fontanel bone area. Please, put your both

576
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:13,050
hands towards Me, like that. All those who
have felt, again cool breeze out of their

577
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:40,850
palm or out of their fingertips, or out of
the fontanel bone area. Or could be hot breeze

578
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:49,540
also, in some people who have not forgiven
themselves and others. Please raise your hands,

579
01:28:00,949 --> 01:28:07,760
those who have.

580
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:14,760
Ah. That’s great. Everyone of you, may God
bless you. I bow to you. I bow to you. It’s

581
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:04,880
tremendous, with all these questions and all
that, still, you have achieved it. It’s

582
01:29:54,270 --> 01:30:01,270
a great achievement. May God bless you for
the future.

583
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:31,860
Would you like to hear one song?

584
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:28,670
(musicians sing Powada)

585
01:35:11,730 --> 01:35:18,730
Now, enjoy yourselves. Enjoy.
