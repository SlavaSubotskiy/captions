1
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,150
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,525
Some of you have found the truth,

3
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:57,150
some of you have not found it fully,

4
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,899
and some of you have not found it at all.

5
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:11,900
But if you look around in today's situation,

6
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:17,775
you'll have to agree there's a big turmoil going on.

7
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,025
Countries after countries are taking

8
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:26,899
to all kinds of wrong things.

9
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,275
Lot of cold war is on,

10
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,025
people are killing each other,

11
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:40,650
destroying beautiful places,

12
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:48,400
cutting each other's throat for nothing at all.

13
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:55,275
They are all human beings created by God.

14
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:58,899
God Almighty has created them

15
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,400
and has brought them to this level of human awareness.

16
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,400
At this juncture

17
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:13,025
one can't see where are we going in a collective way.

18
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:22,900
This is, where have we to reach --or

19
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,899
is it our destiny?

20
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,899
Is this the destiny of human beings,

21
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,275
to be destroyed by each other

22
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,525
for land or for anything else?

23
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:47,275
Think of the whole world as one,

24
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:52,400
and think what's happening all over:

25
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:55,525
every day we read newspaper,

26
00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:00,150
every day there is some sort of a horrible news

27
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,650
about horrible things people are doing to each other,

28
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:07,150
for no rhyme and reason.

29
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,150
We have to think, what is the destiny?

30
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,899
Where are we going?

31
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:27,275
Are we going to hell or to Heaven?

32
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,900
What is our situation around? Can we help it?

33
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:40,025
What's wrong with human beings is

34
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:49,899
they are still in the complete control of ignorance

35
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:52,899
I would call it ignorance.

36
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,900
And in that ignorance, in that darkness,

37
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:01,775
they are doing these horrible things.

38
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,775
Nobody wants to understand that what we are doing

39
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,650
is nothing but complete destruction.

40
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:17,525
Is that our destiny,

41
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,400
that we are going to get destroyed completely?

42
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,275
What good are we doing?

43
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:31,525
Under the name of some sort of nationality

44
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:34,775
or maybe some religion

45
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:39,275
-- all kinds of things which are good --

46
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,899
but we are doing all wrong things.

47
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,025
Fighting.

48
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:48,775
Fighting is not the only thing.

49
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:51,525
We hate.

50
00:16:53,775 --> 00:16:58,150
Anybody who can excite our hatred

51
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:05,650
is very much adorable, very much liked,

52
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,525
and under his guidance we form groups.

53
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,775
All this is coming because this is the Last Judgment.

54
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:22,150
I have told you this is the Last Judgment.

55
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,899
And this Last Judgment will really decide

56
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:33,025
who are to be saved and who are to be doomed completely.

57
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,899
It's a very, very serious thing.

58
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:46,899
All of those who are aware should think about it.

59
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:49,525
Little patchwork here

60
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:52,899
and a little patchwork is not going to help.

61
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:55,899
Whatever you may try,

62
00:17:56,275 --> 00:18:00,899
unless and until you transform human beings,

63
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,275
they cannot be saved.

64
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:12,775
This transformation is not an impossible thing

65
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:15,400
-- it's not difficult.

66
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:18,899
This is the time for transformation,

67
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:21,899
this is a chance for transformation.

68
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:28,150
And within us is placed the power,

69
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,525
as power is described,

70
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:36,150
is the mystical feminine Power within us.

71
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,025
All of them have described it,

72
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,525
I'm not the first person to say that;

73
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,899
but nobody has been able perhaps so far

74
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:55,899
to understand it or to accept it,

75
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:58,899
that it should happen to you.

76
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,899
You are born not only to be human beings,

77
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,775
but you have to be superhuman.

78
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:14,900
You have to enjoy yourself.

79
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,025
Your life should be enjoyable, it should be blissful.

80
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,525
It should not be a curse:

81
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:25,525
morning till evening worried about this, worried about that.

82
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:30,525
That is why you are created.

83
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:34,899
God had no intention of creating people

84
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,400
who will be all the time worried how to quarrel,

85
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:41,775
how to fight, how to save;

86
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:47,900
but people who will live in complete harmony,

87
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,150
peace and joy.

88
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,275
That's why we are created.

89
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,899
That is our destiny -- that is,

90
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:02,150
not just I am telling you, but it's a fact.

91
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:10,900
So we have to be, we have to be transformed.

92
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:15,025
This transformation is not difficult.

93
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:22,775
But what I find, people get satisfied with anything

94
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:26,899
Hindus will go to the temple;

95
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,650
they'll think, "Oh, we have done a great thing."

96
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,400
Christians go to the church;

97
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,900
they'll think they have done very good.

98
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,275
Muslims will go and pray and think that they are great.

99
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:41,899
What have they achieved?

100
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,775
Face yourself, please.

101
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:48,899
Face your limitations.

102
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:51,400
Face your tribulations.

103
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:54,900
Face your problems and see for yourself:

104
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,275
have you been able to solve your problems?

105
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:07,899
Have you been able to save yourself from calamities?

106
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,900
Maybe big calamities may come to destroy people who are,

107
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,899
who are doing harm, maybe.

108
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:22,775
That may be the wish of God.

109
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,900
But what is your wish?

110
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:28,899
Why don't you think that

111
00:21:29,275 --> 00:21:35,650
"I have to be a person who is a store,

112
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:41,025
who is a source of joy and love"?

113
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:47,150
I am not only talking, but I want you all

114
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,775
to get your Self-realization.

115
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,899
What is Self-realization

116
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,899
-- is to know your Self. You don't know your Self.

117
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,775
You don't know.

118
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,900
You are living in this world without knowing your Self

119
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,900
-- can you imagine?

120
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,150
You don't know what you are.

121
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:09,775
You don't know that you are the spirit,

122
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:16,525
and that you are the source of knowledge,

123
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:18,775
of pure knowledge.

124
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,775
I find people sitting in a meeting,

125
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:25,650
listening to some babaji

126
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,150
who is telling them some story, very happy.

127
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:36,775
This is not going to give you the reality and the truth.

128
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:40,400
If you want to have reality and truth,

129
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:43,025
then please try to understand

130
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:45,900
that something has to happen

131
00:22:46,525 --> 00:22:49,900
to you, some transformation has to take place.

132
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,899
You are not yet subtle enough,

133
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,275
you haven't got those subtleties,

134
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:57,899
till you reach that point --

135
00:22:58,275 --> 00:23:01,900
for which you don't have to leave your family,

136
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,150
you don't have to leave your children,

137
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:13,150
you don't have to leave your household and go to the jungles.

138
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:16,899
There's no need to do all that.

139
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:21,025
It's nice to say that "All right, you all take sanyasa

140
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,525
and give all that belongs to you to me."

141
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,275
It's such a stupid idea.

142
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:33,899
These are emergencies today.

143
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:39,775
We are living in a very emergent conditions

144
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,650
-- try to understand.

145
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:44,150
And I want to warn you

146
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,025
that if you don't go deep into yourself

147
00:23:47,525 --> 00:23:50,275
and find out what you are,

148
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,400
and take to your transformation,

149
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:57,900
anything is possible.

150
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,275
All kinds of diseases are coming up,

151
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:07,150
all kinds of new problems of children coming up,

152
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:11,400
all kinds of national problems are there,

153
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,899
all kinds of international problems are there,

154
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,275
that people can't help it.

155
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:26,775
So we have to get out of this and become a solid,

156
00:24:27,025 --> 00:24:30,150
a personality of truth.

157
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:32,775
We don't know what is the truth is.

158
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,899
We are worse than animals whose eyes are open,

159
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:44,025
while our eyes are closed.

160
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,900
Is not to condemn yourself in any way,

161
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:52,650
but to make you alert and aware

162
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,400
that human beings have to change.

163
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,900
Otherwise it's just, you come to My lecture,

164
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,025
tomorrow you come to another lecture -- that's all.

165
00:25:05,525 --> 00:25:08,900
It's a everyday sort of a nice entertainment.

166
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:15,650
But when I see the destiny,

167
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,025
I don't know how many will be ruined,

168
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:22,150
how many will be finished.

169
00:25:22,775 --> 00:25:24,650
What will happen to them?

170
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,275
What diseases they will get,

171
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:30,400
what problems they will get?

172
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:33,025
What will happen to their children,

173
00:25:34,025 --> 00:25:36,400
what will happen to their country,

174
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:39,525
and what will happen to the whole world?

175
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:43,775
Just widen your vision.

176
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:49,650
My vision is that all the people of the world

177
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,525
should get transformation.

178
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:57,775
We have enemies within ourselves,

179
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,275
and when they talk of jihad,

180
00:26:02,775 --> 00:26:06,400
they talk that you fight your enemies within yourself.

181
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,900
What are these enemies?

182
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:13,900
These days, the worst is greed.

183
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:17,650
There is greed.

184
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:23,400
With that greed people can do anything they want to

185
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,900
All kinds of things are happening out of greed.

186
00:26:28,525 --> 00:26:33,525
They'll have money, they'll have all kinds of facilities,

187
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,775
but still this greed is such a satanic will of,

188
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:42,025
that you don't even see what you have.

189
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:46,900
And you want to have more and more, deceive people,

190
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:50,400
deceive your government,

191
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:54,275
deceive everyone and manage it.

192
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:06,525
Then, another worse thing we have is anger.

193
00:27:07,899 --> 00:27:11,775
Anger doesn't allow you to see things as they are.

194
00:27:14,525 --> 00:27:18,525
We develop anger for small things:

195
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:23,900
like you have come to this country --

196
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:32,899
I've seen people who are angry because of different color.

197
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:37,900
I can't understand.

198
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,025
God has made different colors;

199
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,650
other we all would have looked same, like military,

200
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:48,900
and life would have been miserable.

201
00:27:49,275 --> 00:27:52,150
So the color has been created by nature.

202
00:27:52,775 --> 00:27:58,025
So the whites or blacks -- what is the difference?

203
00:27:59,525 --> 00:28:01,899
I just don't understand.

204
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:08,150
Because such a myth is going on.

205
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,275
With this myth we are fighting.

206
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:16,025
The whites are fighting with the blacks,

207
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,025
and the blacks are fighting with the whites.

208
00:28:20,525 --> 00:28:28,400
And then they go also for burning their skin in the sun,

209
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:32,899
getting skin cancers.

210
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:35,525
I just don't understand.

211
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,900
There's no logic, there's no balance

212
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,899
in us to see that what we are doing.

213
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:48,900
Why are we wasting this precious time,

214
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,150
when we have to get transformation?

215
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:56,400
This anger can be with anything;

216
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:01,899
anything one can develop anger.

217
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,650
Is like a human failing, which is very common.

218
00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:12,275
For the smallest thing people can get angry.

219
00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:16,400
And they like it, because with that they can oppress others;

220
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:18,899
they could be aggressive.

221
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:23,150
So they want to have this anger within them,

222
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:28,025
and with that anger they try to dominate others.

223
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:32,150
This is the biggest problem:

224
00:29:32,775 --> 00:29:36,899
why do we want to dominate others,

225
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,899
why do we want to oppress others,

226
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:43,650
and why do we want to take control of others?

227
00:29:44,025 --> 00:29:46,025
We can't control ourselves;

228
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,650
why are we wanting to control others?

229
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,025
What is the need?

230
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,400
Then, there are attachments:

231
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:04,275
attachments to their houses,

232
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:09,650
to their lands, to their children, to everything.

233
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:16,400
But tomorrow you won't be here.

234
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,900
You'll go with open hands.

235
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:24,775
You can't carry anything with you.

236
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:31,275
So such attachment to things:

237
00:30:32,525 --> 00:30:35,525
they're very particular about their cars,

238
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:38,650
about their house, maintain it.

239
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:43,899
But what about yourself? Are you all right?

240
00:30:45,025 --> 00:30:51,025
Inside, are you absolutely calm, peaceful and joyful?

241
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:54,900
Why are you wasting your energy

242
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:06,150
in getting angry with others?

243
00:31:11,525 --> 00:31:21,275
That's the sign of life that will be also destroyed.

244
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:33,900
If you look at another person he has, say, weaknesses,

245
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:39,400
apart from money, for women -- is very common --

246
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,899
or women having for men.

247
00:31:44,025 --> 00:31:47,650
To get attractive, for what?

248
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,275
Everybody has to get old.

249
00:31:52,525 --> 00:31:58,275
What have you achieved by running after women,

250
00:31:58,775 --> 00:32:02,899
running after other sex?

251
00:32:04,025 --> 00:32:08,899
You have no sense of dignity, no sense of honor.

252
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,275
If you are -- as long as you wear very good clothes

253
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,899
you are regarded wonderful person.

254
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:17,899
This is not the way.

255
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,899
We have to introspect and see for ourselves:

256
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
why are we doing this,

257
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:27,899
wasting our energy into nonsensical thing?

258
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:37,775
So many people I meet are really half-mad and far gone;

259
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:40,400
some of them are full-mad.

260
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,900
And what they tell Me, that

261
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,775
they wanted to marry a particular woman

262
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,900
and a particular man or anything,

263
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,025
and that's how they got it. I mean, how fragile!

264
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,900
That's not being very great.

265
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:04,400
You have to be very, very strong within yourself.

266
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:09,525
Feel your Self. Your Self is the spirit,

267
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:13,275
is the reflection of God Almighty within you.

268
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:16,400
You can be very strong,

269
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:18,650
you can be very healthy

270
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:20,900
and you can be absolutely balanced,

271
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,150
if you become the spirit.

272
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,650
You have heard so much about spirit and spiritual life

273
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:34,899
-- but have you reached that point?

274
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:39,650
Even when you read, say, Zen system,

275
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,650
Tao system, Bible, Koran, anything,

276
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,900
do you know how to reach that point of the spirit?

277
00:33:51,525 --> 00:33:53,900
Not yet. Not yet.

278
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,899
You have to know that;

279
00:33:57,275 --> 00:33:59,775
because you are very great,

280
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,900
you are very precious,

281
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:06,899
and you are so beautiful within.

282
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,275
But you are not aware of it.

283
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,525
You have to become that.

284
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,900
That becoming is very important,

285
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:23,900
and for that already God Almighty has organized within you

286
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:29,025
which is called as kundalini,

287
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,900
which can be awakened,

288
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,275
and its awakening can give you Self-realization,

289
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,400
can give you self-knowledge which we call "Atma sakshatkar."

290
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:48,025
That's what is very, very important in your life to have it.

291
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:49,900
And when it is free --

292
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:53,275
you can't pay for it, how much can you pay?

293
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:58,899
-- when it is absolutely free,

294
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:02,900
why don't you take your Self-realization,

295
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,525
and why don't you grow?

296
00:35:07,025 --> 00:35:10,150
Instead of fighting in the name of religion.

297
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:16,650
Every religion has said "You know thy Self."

298
00:35:19,899 --> 00:35:22,150
Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly,

299
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,150
"At the time of resurrection your hands will speak."

300
00:35:27,775 --> 00:35:29,899
Are they speaking?

301
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,400
Hindus know about it,

302
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:36,900
that we have to get our Self-realization.

303
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:41,899
No use just listening to these babajis and giving them money.

304
00:35:46,025 --> 00:35:51,775
All this kind of rituals

305
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,900
that we have been doing, our forefathers have been doing:

306
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,525
what have we achieved? Nothing.

307
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:04,650
So now, it's important for us to know

308
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:10,899
that we have to have our evolution,

309
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:15,899
reaching to the point of Self-realization.

310
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:20,899
If we were perfect there would have been no problem

311
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,150
If we were self-realized people

312
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,150
there would have been no problem.

313
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,899
All kinds of selfishness,

314
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:38,025
all kinds of limits we have put upon ourselves,

315
00:36:38,775 --> 00:36:41,525
all kinds of conditioning and ego

316
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:47,899
which has been working our life and have been ruining us,

317
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:51,400
we have to get over it.

318
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:54,650
And once you get over it, you get united.

319
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,775
Nobody has to tell you that you get united.

320
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,899
You lose all misidentifications.

321
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,275
Your misidentifications are that,

322
00:37:05,775 --> 00:37:07,899
that "we belong to this country,

323
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:09,900
we belong to this religion, we belong to that."

324
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,650
You belong to nothing.

325
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,400
You belong to the Kingdom of God.

326
00:37:18,899 --> 00:37:20,900
That's what you have to achieve,

327
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,899
and you should be one there.

328
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,150
But if you like story-telling, there's no end to it.

329
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:30,775
But you are wasting your time.

330
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,900
The time is running short.

331
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,650
I've been now here for the last,

332
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:38,025
I don't know, twenty years or so.

333
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,899
I worked very hard,

334
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,275
but what I find that people don't realize

335
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,650
what they are supposed to do.

336
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,900
They like people who will just say something very simple

337
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,650
-- all right, it's a little entertainment.

338
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:07,650
So the whole humanity has to understand

339
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:14,900
that destiny of destruction is to be avoided.

340
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,900
Complete destruction is to be avoided.

341
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,150
And very simple is that you enter into the Kingdom of God

342
00:38:25,899 --> 00:38:28,899
-- which is very easy: you don't have to pay anything,

343
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,775
don't have to work out anything.

344
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,275
You take your Self-realization,

345
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:41,275
and then at home you spend about ten minutes meditating.

346
00:38:43,775 --> 00:38:49,650
Only your mind is all the time justifying your misbehavior.

347
00:38:50,025 --> 00:38:53,899
I call it "misbehavior" because it's against you.

348
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:58,899
It's against God's wish,

349
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:02,900
it's against humanity

350
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,025
and it will destroy all the human beings.

351
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:13,400
All these misidentifications have to be dropped,

352
00:39:13,899 --> 00:39:17,275
and you have to know that we are all one.

353
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:22,899
We are all one, we are all global,

354
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:28,150
we are not separated by color,

355
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:32,899
race or religion, nation -- no.

356
00:39:34,275 --> 00:39:35,899
We are all one,

357
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:40,525
and that oneness should not be established by slogans

358
00:39:41,899 --> 00:39:43,400
or by shouting,

359
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:47,400
but should be that oneness is to be felt within.

360
00:39:50,275 --> 00:39:52,900
It's not artificial.

361
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,899
It has to be real, very real oneness,

362
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:59,899
and that comes to you once you realize

363
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,150
that you are part and parcel of the whole.

364
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:11,525
Religions have brought you up to this point of awareness

365
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,025
-- not for fighting, not for killing.

366
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,275
Why, why?

367
00:40:21,899 --> 00:40:25,025
Human beings have diverted themselves.

368
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:30,400
Because of complete ignorance of righteousness.

369
00:40:31,525 --> 00:40:40,150
Because of complete greed of oneself:

370
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:47,525
oneself, just yourself, or your family at the most,

371
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,275
or your relation.

372
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:54,817
Why do you want to delimit yourself?

373
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:56,899
You are the spirit.

374
00:40:57,317 --> 00:41:03,899
Spirit is the ocean, ocean of knowledge,

375
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,775
is the ocean of love,

376
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,775
is the ocean of all blessings.

377
00:41:13,025 --> 00:41:15,900
So we have to decide.

378
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:19,150
Today I have to request you,

379
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:22,525
that there's not so much time left.

380
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:27,900
We have to decide that we have to become the spirit

381
00:41:28,525 --> 00:41:31,275
That's all the religions have taught.

382
00:41:31,775 --> 00:41:38,275
But how to do it was not so much explained,

383
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:41,775
and it didn't work out.

384
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:46,025
Some of them did get it but they were outcasted.

385
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,650
Nobody listened to them.

386
00:41:49,025 --> 00:41:52,150
Even people killed them and tortured them, crucified them.

387
00:41:53,650 --> 00:42:00,650
But now, please, all of you try to understand

388
00:42:01,025 --> 00:42:03,400
the value of your life.

389
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,900
Why are you a human being?

390
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,150
Why are you created?

391
00:42:09,775 --> 00:42:11,775
What is the purpose behind it?

392
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:16,650
Are we going to be driven by nonsensical ideas?

393
00:42:18,025 --> 00:42:27,400
Are we going to be finished by all sorts of dividing factors?

394
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,650
No, no, we are all going to get your Self-realization,

395
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,275
and we are going to understand the value of our life.

396
00:42:39,275 --> 00:42:43,400
The problem is, you'll get your realization

397
00:42:43,775 --> 00:42:47,650
in the sense the power within you will rise.

398
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:49,899
It's very well organized;

399
00:42:50,275 --> 00:42:53,400
actually, God is a great creator.

400
00:42:53,899 --> 00:42:59,650
How He has balanced and how it works out is remarkable.

401
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,899
Every individual He has done it.

402
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,400
With that happening, is not sufficient.

403
00:43:09,899 --> 00:43:12,899
You enter into, say, a palace

404
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,900
and then you go round and see for yourself

405
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,775
how beautiful you are,

406
00:43:20,275 --> 00:43:23,525
what beautiful things God has made for you.

407
00:43:25,025 --> 00:43:27,525
Then grow into it.

408
00:43:27,899 --> 00:43:30,650
Once you have grown into it,

409
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:36,525
then you will realize what a great thing you are:

410
00:43:37,775 --> 00:43:45,899
the greatest gem, the greatest person, so loving.

411
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,899
There have been some

412
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,525
-- they have become just statues.

413
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:58,400
Nobody tries to understand what were they doing,

414
00:43:58,899 --> 00:44:00,525
how they were there.

415
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:10,899
So, tonight we can have the experience,

416
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:15,899
the experience of the spirit.

417
00:44:16,275 --> 00:44:20,025
Is a very unusual, rare thing.

418
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:22,400
It never used to happen like that.

419
00:44:22,899 --> 00:44:26,400
But it is now, so why not take advantage of it?

420
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:32,775
Please, be ready for that,

421
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:37,275
accept it, take it, and become.

422
00:44:37,899 --> 00:44:39,900
Becoming is the point.

423
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,900
What you become is the point.

424
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,650
And what you make out of this whole human civilization

425
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:53,775
is your problem, not Mine.

426
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,400
I can help you.

427
00:44:57,899 --> 00:44:59,899
I can work it out.

428
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:07,275
So I would request you all to now be ready for Self-realization.

429
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,899
It's much better,

430
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,900
but those who do not want to have cannot be forced.

431
00:45:17,899 --> 00:45:20,775
So it's better such people leave,

432
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,275
leave the hall if they don't want to have.

433
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,899
May God bless you all.

434
00:45:56,899 --> 00:45:59,525
Firstly, you don't have to do anything

435
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,899
-- meaning also, don't think what I have said.

436
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,275
Try to keep your thoughts very peaceful,

437
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:18,775
and I'm sure all of you can get your Self-realization.

438
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,899
But how many will grow?

439
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,900
Because you have to come to the follow-up,

440
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,525
then you have to practice it in the centers

441
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:36,650
-- and it works out.

442
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:41,025
Little bit time you have to give to yourself,

443
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:45,275
and to this global problem.

444
00:46:46,899 --> 00:46:49,275
You have to dedicate yourself to that.

445
00:46:49,899 --> 00:46:53,899
Is very important: you have to dedicate yourself.

446
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:57,775
That doesn't mean that you have to become sanyasi

447
00:46:58,025 --> 00:47:01,150
or you have to be busy with this for twenty-four hours -- nothing.

448
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:07,275
But this dedication will make you so much

449
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:11,025
one with yourself,

450
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:13,899
with the whole universe,

451
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,025
that I don't have to tell you that you dedicate

452
00:47:18,525 --> 00:47:21,525
-- you'll dedicate by yourself.

453
00:47:24,899 --> 00:47:27,899
So please don't stay here

454
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,525
if you don't want to have Self-realization.

455
00:47:31,025 --> 00:47:32,900
Nothing will happen to you.

456
00:47:33,525 --> 00:47:38,775
Please leave the hall in case you don't want Self-realization.

457
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:57,900
What you have to do is not to do anything;

458
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,275
to put just your hands towards Me.

459
00:48:04,275 --> 00:48:07,275
Of course, if you are wearing shoes better take them out,

460
00:48:07,899 --> 00:48:10,775
because Mother Earth is very important.

461
00:48:12,275 --> 00:48:14,900
Please put both the hands towards Me.

462
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,900
You don't have to pray,

463
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,899
you don't have to say anything; just

464
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,899
put your hands towards Me, just like this.

465
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,899
Now please close your eyes.

466
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:58,650
It is important. Please close your eyes.

467
00:49:08,525 --> 00:49:13,400
This power, kundalini, is placed in the triangular bone,

468
00:49:15,899 --> 00:49:19,899
known as sacrum, means "sacred",

469
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:29,400
and it rises through six centers of the parasympathetic,

470
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,400
and ultimately pierces through

471
00:49:37,525 --> 00:49:40,400
the fontanel bone area

472
00:49:40,775 --> 00:49:43,150
which was a soft bone in your head,

473
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:46,150
on top of your head.

474
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:54,400
When you were a child, it was a soft bone.

475
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,899
It pierces through that,

476
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:02,525
and enters into the subtle energy

477
00:50:04,525 --> 00:50:12,025
of all-pervading Power of divine love.

478
00:50:14,899 --> 00:50:17,650
They call it by different name.

479
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:23,275
They call it "Paramachaitanya" -- some call it "chaitanya."

480
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:28,275
Some call it as "ruh."

481
00:50:28,899 --> 00:50:34,899
You may call it by any name -- is the love, love of God.

482
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,900
Once you get connected with you,

483
00:50:40,275 --> 00:50:44,275
when you start feeling on your fingers

484
00:50:46,525 --> 00:50:48,400
some sort of a breeze.

485
00:50:48,899 --> 00:50:51,899
First some people will get hot, doesn't matter;

486
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,525
but then it cools down

487
00:50:55,899 --> 00:50:59,650
and you get the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as they call it.

488
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:04,400
And it starts flowing.

489
00:51:06,275 --> 00:51:09,900
You can now raise your left hand

490
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,025
on top of your fontanel bone area.

491
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:17,899
Keep your eyes shut, and see for yourself

492
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:22,650
if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

493
00:51:32,775 --> 00:51:34,525
You can move your hand.

494
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:40,025
Now see with your right hand

495
00:51:40,899 --> 00:51:43,525
if there's a cool or a hot breeze

496
00:51:43,899 --> 00:51:47,025
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

497
00:51:47,525 --> 00:51:50,400
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

498
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,400
See for yourself.

499
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:55,025
Bend your head; better is to bend.

500
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,650
Please bend your head.

501
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,650
Again put your right hand towards Me

502
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:09,900
and see for yourself with the left hand,

503
00:52:10,525 --> 00:52:16,400
see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

504
00:52:16,899 --> 00:52:19,900
If it is hot it's all right, doesn't matter.

505
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,775
It is coming because of the heat within you.

506
00:52:40,275 --> 00:52:45,275
Now all those who have felt cool or a hot breeze

507
00:52:45,899 --> 00:52:48,400
in their hands or on their fingers,

508
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,525
or out of the fontanel bone area

509
00:52:51,899 --> 00:52:53,899
-- this is the real baptism --

510
00:52:54,025 --> 00:52:56,899
please raise both your hands.

511
00:53:05,899 --> 00:53:07,275
Just imagine:

512
00:53:07,899 --> 00:53:11,775
you are the soldiers who are going to save the world

513
00:53:12,775 --> 00:53:14,899
from its destruction.

514
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,525
Try to understand your importance.

515
00:53:19,025 --> 00:53:21,525
You can put down your hand.

516
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,899
Everyone practically has felt it.

517
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,400
That means you are already matured

518
00:53:28,899 --> 00:53:30,775
to get your spiritual life.

519
00:53:31,025 --> 00:53:33,775
You are just on the brink of it.

520
00:53:34,275 --> 00:53:36,400
That's how you got it.

521
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:41,900
It's last jump to reality.

522
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,899
Now, you should know what is this, what are you,

523
00:53:47,899 --> 00:53:49,900
what is your spirit

524
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,775
and what you can do; what are your powers are,

525
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:57,150
what are spiritual powers.

526
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:59,400
For this I would request you

527
00:53:59,899 --> 00:54:02,275
to first to come to the follow-up program,

528
00:54:02,775 --> 00:54:07,525
and after that you can join any one of the centers

529
00:54:07,899 --> 00:54:11,025
which are closer to you and work it out.

530
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:13,900
We have to work for the whole world.

531
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,900
You should know there are eighty-five countries

532
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,899
which are following Sahaja Yoga.

533
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:26,650
And surprisingly, black country like Benin,

534
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,899
we have twenty thousand Sahaja yogis.

535
00:54:30,275 --> 00:54:33,025
Only three years back I started there.

536
00:54:33,525 --> 00:54:37,899
And in England it's more than sixteen years

537
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,900
I've been working here, and after that also:

538
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,025
all the time, every year.

539
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,150
But somehow

540
00:54:53,775 --> 00:54:58,525
their growth is very much there,

541
00:54:59,899 --> 00:55:07,650
but not subtle growth, not within ourselves.

542
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:17,650
The growth is within, and you'll enjoy,

543
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:20,899
very much enjoy the reality.

544
00:55:21,275 --> 00:55:25,025
The reality is beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

545
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:28,525
May God bless you.

546
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,900
They want to sing one song

547
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:39,150
which was written in the twelfth century

548
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:42,899
by a saint in India and is sung in all the villages,

549
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:45,775
but nobody knows the meaning of that.

550
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:50,900
The meaning is that "Oh Mother,

551
00:55:51,525 --> 00:55:54,025
give me the union, 'Jogwa'

552
00:55:54,775 --> 00:55:56,025
-- give me the union.

553
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,900
I will give up my bad habits. I'll give up my temper. I'll give ..."

554
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,899
You don't have to do it.

555
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:06,899
Now you'll give up automatically.

556
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,275
The light that you'll have, itself,

557
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:15,400
automatically you will give up, automatically.

558
00:56:15,899 --> 00:56:17,650
You don't have to do anything.

559
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,650
But you have to meditate.

560
00:56:20,983 --> 00:56:24,899
About ten minutes, it's not much.

561
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,692
They are so much full of joy

562
00:56:34,983 --> 00:56:39,650
that they go, want to go on singing all the while.
