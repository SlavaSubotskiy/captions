1
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:19,860
I am happy to know so many of you have come
here and I feel this is a very important puja,

2
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,369
not only for Australia but for the whole world,
because it has the greatest message which

3
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:36,369
we have actualized now in Sahaja yoga. We
have to understand the message of Christ.

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,440
There are many people in this world who try
to show off that they are very great rationalists

5
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,440
and that they have a right to pass any remark
they like about Christ.

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:59,040
I was reading the newspapers today. I was
surprised where they are all saying one by

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,579
one that, "I reject this part of Christ that
He was born with Immaculate Conception. I

8
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:16,579
reject that He was resurrected. I reject this
and I reject that." Who are you? Because you

9
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:24,450
can write, because you have a flair, how can
you say such things? Just without finding

10
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:34,320
out. You are a scholar, maybe you are very
well read, maybe that you think you are capable

11
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,320
of saying whatever you like about any subject,
but subject of spirituality cannot be dealt

12
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,150
by people who are not even self-realized.

13
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:55,150
Because it's a very divine life, it's a very
different life. It's a area where your mind

14
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:06,869
cannot enter. It is beyond the mind. And so
the poets or artists, all of them who have

15
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:17,009
worked on Christ's life and have tried to
say things about Him, mostly were realized

16
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:25,630
souls and if they were not, they could not
do any justice to His life.

17
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:32,630
It's very surprising that I should be celebrating
this resurrection in Australia. You know this

18
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:44,099
is the country of mooladhara, and mooladhara
itself then expresses itself or manifests

19
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:57,239
in the agnya. So, such a great connection
you have that first of all is the country

20
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,720
where mooladhara is established, was established
I should say, and later on that it was manifested

21
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:20,739
in the life of Christ on the agnya center.
I must say that you have really created some

22
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,560
very great people signifying this beautiful
manifestation because, as you have Dr. Bogdan

23
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:41,470
who is an Australian, in the sense that he
lived here and then he went back to Russia

24
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:48,950
which is the right agnya, where he worked.

25
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:56,129
In the same way, as Sahaja yoga has prospered
here to begin with, among all the European

26
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:05,040
countries, or we can say, among all the countries
which were not Indian, maximum growth took

27
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:23,780
place in Australia and the maximum growth
now first took place in the Eastern Bloc,

28
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,319
in Russia.

29
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:34,319
Now the other part of the agnya is China.
And it is you people only... out of you only

30
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:46,809
some people have to look after that. And as
it is you're all looking after Taiwan, Hong

31
00:04:53,229 --> 00:05:00,229
Kong, Thailand. All these are Chinese races.
Apart from that, they worship Buddha. It's

32
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:14,129
very interesting. Buddha, as you know, is
on the left side of your medha, as they call

33
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:22,629
it, this is the medha plate, is the lower
plate of the brain. So the Christ is in the

34
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:31,449
center and we've got Buddha on the left side.
Or, you also are looking after the countries

35
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:41,979
which are influenced by Buddha. It's all working
out like a plan. Perhaps you're not aware

36
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:51,110
of it, that we are all people belonging to
one Virata and that our needs or our work,

37
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:02,809
all of them have great significance and connection.

38
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:09,809
About Australia, there's a myth in India that
there was a big saint and he was very good,

39
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:24,020
but somehow he made some mistakes... or maybe
lots of mistakes. So God cursed him and said

40
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:32,699
you better go away from India. It was connecting
India and Africa. So the land was brought

41
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:41,129
down to this point. He gave him the land - God
- and He said, "Now you resurrect this land

42
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:49,389
and make something out of it." And this star
is called as this Trishanku [MEANS As per

43
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,710
Indian Mythology, a saint king who wished
to go to heaven alive, but was stopped & kept

44
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,800
hanging in between by Gods, as he was being
sent by Sage Vishwamitra, and then became

45
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,429
a star], which is your Southern Cross. This
Southern Cross is called as Trishanku, as

46
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:04,709
in... mentioned in our Puranas [MEANS One
type of Indian scriptures] as this saint who

47
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:11,709
became like that and God made him into a star
which is hanging. Trishanku is hanging on

48
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:21,099
top of this land and is working out the building
up of this country. He was told that you go

49
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:32,990
there and make a heaven for the human beings.
This has so many mythological and historical

50
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:43,839
backgrounds.

51
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,889
And there are some very good points also I
have seen about Australia, which are very

52
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:55,889
surprising because they believe in the multi-racial
society and they preserve it. They try to

53
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:03,729
help the people through justice if some people
are troubled and tortured. It's a very bold

54
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:14,499
attitude towards progress that we should have
multicultural society and this comes, again

55
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:24,129
I would say, after resurrection of political
thought. America is multicultural society,

56
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:36,729
full of it, and as a result of that, as a
result of that they have progressed very much

57
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:48,520
financially. But they didn't learn anything
from the multicultural society. For example,

58
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:59,490
Spanish went there. Spanish, as you know,
are bullfighters. They went and destroyed

59
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:06,490
all the cultures of the ancient times and
the new people who have gone, they don't have

60
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:15,290
any rapport with them. Like Indians have a
separate identity, then we have other cultures

61
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:22,829
like Islamic and all that, so they don't keep
any connection with them. The original aboriginals

62
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:30,629
are also kept out as something very low-level.
But here I find people have a curiosity and

63
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:41,490
also knowledge about the other cultures which
are around them. That shows the sense of collectivity

64
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:51,350
is within your genes, we can say, that it
is working out in such a way that this country

65
00:09:55,829 --> 00:10:02,769
believes still in the multicultural society.

66
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:09,769
All these are manifestation of Shri Ganesha's
quality. See if you have, say, a group of

67
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:22,189
even ten people with husband and wife and
they don't have the purity of Shri Ganesha,

68
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:29,740
they cannot exist because there will be always
a very great conflict between husband and

69
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:38,250
wife. Also, not only the conflict part, but
people will become extremely superficial.

70
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:47,569
Like, in America a woman would marry a man
because he wears such and such dress; or a

71
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:58,069
woman is appreciated because she has a particular
type of hairstyle. If the hairstyle changes,

72
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:05,750
the man can ask for a divorce. So superficial
they are. The fight is with the husband that

73
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:13,160
you didn't buy a particular coat which I liked,
so there's a divorce. It's so superficial.

74
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:20,160
So the relationship between husband and wife
is established by Shri Ganesh and He gives

75
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:28,620
you the pure idea about how to enjoy your
married life. Why people like Freud become

76
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,980
so important? They start replacing Christ
and people become enamored by that. Because

77
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:52,389
human beings, if they know that in potential
state they are all divine, they all have to

78
00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:01,250
become divine and not to go down to the level
of animals, even worse than that. If they

79
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:10,240
realize it that their main object of life
is resurrection, that they have to rise above

80
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:19,699
all these so-called temptations of life. If
they know this potential, then they have to

81
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:32,319
believe in it also, so that they do not have
these absurd ideas about life.

82
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:49,850
As a human being, Christ came. He came as
a human being, but He was not a human being.

83
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:57,499
He was divine. Absolutely He was nothing but
Aumkara. That's why He could walk on the water.

84
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,540
There was nothing materialistic in Him, you
can say, no matter in Him. If there was any

85
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:11,540
matter, He could not have walked on the water.
But if people start discarding all these facts,

86
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:21,279
about His birth, about His walking on the
water and all that, then what is left of Christ,

87
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:26,459
I can't understand.

88
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:32,699
Now this message of His resurrection is very
important, but what you find that, as you

89
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:39,540
get three days holidays, people are just doing
what one should not do. They have gone to

90
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:46,540
some places, maybe with their wives, may not
be with their wives, with anybody, into some

91
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,800
sort of a rubbish and they enjoy things which
cannot be enjoyed by anybody who is a realized

92
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:04,019
soul. So we have to know ourself that now
we have got our realization. We got it. Not

93
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:10,279
that it is in a potential state, but it is
in a kinetic state. So, for us Christ should

94
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:17,279
be a model, what kind of life we should lead.

95
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,680
In those days of Christ, there were no aeroplanes,
there were no cars, nothing, but He went from

96
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:32,029
places to places and talked to them about
spiritual life. The people were not yet evolved.

97
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:41,379
They were not matured enough. So He could
not give them realization, but He talked about

98
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:50,860
dharmic life. He went to the extreme of the
ten commandments that He said not only that

99
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:05,230
you should not do adultery, but you should
not even have adulterous eyes. Pure eyes.

100
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:13,850
Now how is it possible? When you see Christians
and Christian nations, they suffer from this

101
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:23,029
disease of not having at all clean eyes. There's
a kind of a lust and greed in the eye and

102
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,870
they're not ashamed of it.

103
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:36,870
Thank God, Sahaja Yogis all over the world
have changed so much, transformed so much.

104
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:44,939
They've become so beautiful that this problem
we don't have. And if somebody has it, we

105
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:51,939
want that person to get out of Sahaja yoga
till they cure themselves and come to normal.

106
00:15:53,769 --> 00:16:00,769
The main problem of the Christian nation is
that they have become too much mental. Even

107
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:10,029
sex they do mentally, in the sense [that]
they flirt. The eyes are so much all the time

108
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:19,529
looking at something and reacting to it. They
cannot witness anything. Anything they'll

109
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:28,459
see they start thinking about it, react to
it. Then the reaction, because they are not

110
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:39,180
evolved, can take them to any level of bestiality
- Worse than beasts. For example, an innocent

111
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:49,730
person sees something, he goes into thoughtless
awareness and he just enjoys the beauty of

112
00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:01,779
that; but a person who is full of lust and
greed can never enjoy anything. On the contrary,

113
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:09,410
he would like to possess that thing or would
go beyond limits of his authority and enjoy

114
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,429
somebody else's wife, somebody else's husband.

115
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:24,429
It's a very subtle thing, which we should
understand when we make friendship with others.

116
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:31,789
What do we enjoy in the friendship? What do
we see in that friendship? As realized soul,

117
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,640
how your friendship should be? The friendship
should be pure - nirvajya. That is, you're

118
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:49,770
friendly with somebody because just you enjoy
the pure friendship, where there's no sense

119
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:01,370
of possession or also the sense of destruction.
Such a friendship is a Sahaj friendship. I

120
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:19,020
have seen people all over the world, when
they come to Ganapatipule, the way they laugh,

121
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:26,020
the way they enjoy and I feel so happy there's
this new world of such innocent people has

122
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,120
been created on this Earth in My lifetime.

123
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:39,120
You should also realize that you belong now
to a very higher type of people, very higher

124
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:48,470
type. There's no justification for any Sahaja
Yogi to indulge into such dirty stuff, because

125
00:18:54,490 --> 00:19:01,490
he is beyond it. He has developed a new sense
of beauty and cleanliness. He cannot bear

126
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:10,700
anything, which makes him look like a person
who goes towards all kinds of filthy things.

127
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:21,149
This is a specialty, which you have got it,
which was potentially within you and despite

128
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,159
the atmosphere in which you lived and you
saw, you just got out of it and became like

129
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:35,159
beautiful lotuses in the pond of filth. And
these lotuses themselves can give such beautiful

130
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:46,649
fragrance to others that they can make the
whole pond fragrant and beautiful.

131
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:53,990
So the responsibility on you is much more
than, I would say, on Christ because Christ

132
00:19:55,529 --> 00:20:02,529
was divine. I was asking them to get Devi
Mahatmyam, if possible. In that He's described

133
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:10,470
as the son of Lord Krishna and Radhaji and
that He has been given a special power and

134
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:20,130
is called as a Support of the Universe. Just
imagine. Mooladhar. He is the Support of the

135
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,320
Universe. And the birth is described in a
beautiful way that first He was created like

136
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:36,850
an egg. This purity, this auspiciousness was
made into an egg. That's why during Easter

137
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,880
you people give eggs to friends. Now this
egg was nicely also kept for ages and then

138
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:59,730
it was broken into two. The first one became
Shri Ganesha and the second one, which evolved

139
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:11,720
fully... like an egg when it is evolved and
is fully mature, the second one was Christ.

140
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:22,450
You may say that, "How is it one egg has two
forms?" I must say these are divine happenings.

141
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:33,669
They have very different from what we see
in the mundane world.

142
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:40,669
Now, this egg, the second part of it, became
a child and He was crying for His Father.

143
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:49,330
All His life, Christ talked for His Father
and when He knew He] will be crucified, He

144
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:58,360
prayed to His Father saying that "Oh Father,
save Me from this cup of crucifixion," He

145
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,240
prayed. And if you see His two fingers, these
two fingers are always out - expression of

146
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:18,409
His blessing. This is the one, which stands,
as you know very well, for Shri Krishna, and

147
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:20,059
this one for Vishnu.

148
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:27,059
So always He showed these two fingers. There
are so many things by which we can, as Sahaja

149
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Yogis, find out how Christ has been ruling
throughout. He is not dead. His body might

150
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:48,559
have been perished in Kashmir, as they say,
but He was the spirit and the spirit that

151
00:22:53,620 --> 00:23:00,620
was in Him was a living, eternally living,
great personality. We may say that He might

152
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:17,250
have had little bit of, we can say, the human
aspect to camouflage Himself, after all spirit

153
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:26,940
just cannot come in, and that might have been
dead, that part, that camouflage that He was

154
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:30,580
using.

155
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:37,580
In divinity, as Ganesha is pure, He is absolutely
beyond any kind of contamination. Other incarnations

156
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:56,940
who came on this Earth, they had to do many
things. Like Shri Krishna had to go in the

157
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:06,019
war of Mahabharata. Rama had to go in the
jungle to deal with people. Same with Christ,

158
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:16,159
we can say, that He did go to all these places,
but He never behaved like a human being. Others

159
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:25,710
did. Shri Rama cried a lot, wept a lot for
His wife. Then Shri Krishna married so many

160
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:38,110
times - because they were His powers so He
married them.

161
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:43,130
So, though they were incarnations, they had
to very much do the things which human beings

162
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:50,130
do. Christ was never married. He never wept,
as far as we know, except when He was praying

163
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:58,970
to His Father. He just asked that "If You
could remove this cup from My mouth I'll be

164
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,580
very happy."

165
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,600
So it's shown in His character that He came
on this Earth as a divine personality, lived

166
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,600
as a divine personality and died as a divine
personality. I think that way it is much easier

167
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:23,149
to be because you are a divine person, you
come, give some sermons, lectures, this, that

168
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,460
and just go away.

169
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:33,460
He didn't take the responsibility of giving
realization to people, which is the greatest

170
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:40,100
headache, I think, to give realizations to
people. Because, if you give them the resurrection,

171
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:47,100
if they get their realization... Christ accepted
His resurrection as a natural thing because

172
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:52,750
He knew all about it, and that He didn't have
to change. He didn't have to transform Himself.

173
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:59,750
He was the same as He was because He did not
need any resurrection. He just tried to show

174
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:07,610
in His life that we human beings can have
our realization and we can be resurrected.

175
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:14,610
His message is not the cross but the resurrection
and this resurrection if you understand, then

176
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:23,470
one can understand also one more thing - that
we are now resurrected from ordinary human

177
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,169
beings to the divine level.

178
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:35,169
It was easier for Christ because He didn't
have to face any problems, while you are coming

179
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:43,149
out of that human life to a such a higher
life. Suddenly, it is too much. I agree. It

180
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:55,279
is too much to accept. But because you go
beyond your mind, it's not difficult - because

181
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:08,760
your mind stops thinking. Otherwise, normally
people would have been thinking, "Now, I am

182
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:17,799
resurrected. All right. So what should I do?
What should I drop out? What things should

183
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:24,799
go away? What is the goal?" All these ideas
of human beings would have followed you slowly.

184
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:32,960
But no, you just felt, "We are there. Now
what to do? We are there." You became conscious

185
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:46,139
of your qualities, of your virtues, of your
greatness and those who were conscious became

186
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:53,460
very confident that we have these values already
existing within us; we have these powers,

187
00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:01,200
which are manifesting and these powers are
flowing through us.

188
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Nobody doubted it. Some did, but very few.
As you grew up, immediately you knew that

189
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:14,950
the Divine is acting through you. Is there.
Everything is tangible. You know everything

190
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:21,950
about your inner being. Gradually, you start
spreading out your self, spreading out your

191
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:31,080
personality. And then you don't have the weaknesses
as human beings have. We had some funny people,

192
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:36,669
no doubt. I know that people start thinking
about how to make money out of Sahaja Yoga,

193
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:43,070
- and that's still a human nonsense going
on - or how to show your powers, how to show

194
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:50,070
how your powers can assert, how to sort of
use your ego to put down people. All these

195
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:05,559
are human style of lives and it existed for
some time, but now I find you all are washed

196
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:15,299
as if through this kundalini has just washed
you completely.

197
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:16,630
You all have become very beautiful people,
extremely beautiful, and even people... they

198
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:23,320
see you at the airport and they think that
these are some unique people. Even in this

199
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:30,320
area when we came, they were telling Me that...
the gentleman who is the caretaker was saying

200
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:39,019
that he has never seen such a group - "They
don't fight; they don't argue; they don't

201
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:46,019
make money; the children are so sweet. It's
remarkable, such a society in these modern

202
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:53,509
times never existed anywhere and how is it,
it is existing here?" They were quite surprised

203
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:01,940
as, also you should be, that you have achieved
this without any much effort or any penance

204
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:10,320
or going to Himalayas. You got it because
it was all there. It was all there and you

205
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:18,120
found it. Our marriages are, ninety percent
are successful. We have problems from the

206
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:25,120
parents sometimes, from the society, but it's
too little to be mentioned and it makes one

207
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:33,490
sense to Me - that we can really change this
world. No doubt about it. If you remember

208
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:43,850
that the message of Christ is resurrection,
that has already happened.

209
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:50,850
Now, after resurrection what? Your attention
should be there. If it is still on your job,

210
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:59,039
on your money, on your car, your house, this,
that, then you are still a human being. You

211
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:06,039
have not yet lost that attachment. Or on your
children and your spouses and all. That is

212
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:15,730
all being still absolutely human. But a person
who is divine has all the relations but doesn't

213
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:23,919
get attached and involved into. I've given
many a time a very good] example of the trees.

214
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:32,179
See in the tree the sap rises, goes to various
parts of the tree, either it is evaporated

215
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:38,460
or it goes back to Mother Earth. It never
gets attached to anything. As long you are

216
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:45,460
attached to your children, attached to this,
attached to that, then try to understand that

217
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:52,750
divinity has not fully manifested. That detachment
is not neglect, never. On the contrary, it

218
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,000
is the most pure detachment, which really
nourishes every area of your life. Wherever

219
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:16,860
you go, it nourishes. So you have to test
yourself. Nobody else has to do it. "How far

220
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:25,500
I have been kind to others? How far I have
been helpful to others? How far I have been

221
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,720
collective?"

222
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,659
I have seen glimpses of this many a times
and it has given Me great joy. Like, once

223
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:41,659
we had a program of Sahaja yogis and the gentleman
had invited Me alone for dinner. So the program

224
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:50,990
was there and I just thought that how can
all these people eat in his house, you see?

225
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,909
So I waited till they disappeared, all the
Sahaja Yogis disappeared. This gentleman came

226
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:03,389
to say, "Mother why did you ask them to go?
I had cooked for all of them." See this made

227
00:33:03,389 --> 00:33:10,330
Me so happy. He had a small house. I don't
know how he cooked for all of them. And so

228
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:15,779
much food he had cooked already and he was
waiting - all of them to have some food, and

229
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:20,669
I just thought that it is too much for him
to feed so many people.

230
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:27,669
In the same way, we have to have this feeling
that we are all collective and we have to

231
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:34,549
help each other. It is, say in the body, if
I have any problem in any finger, any hand,

232
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:41,549
anywhere, the whole body runs for it, the
whole body suffers for it, whole body knows

233
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:50,730
about it. In the same way, in Sahaja Yoga
there should be a common feeling all over

234
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:58,309
the world. If something happens here, one
person is affected, the whole world should

235
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:05,720
know. Not only that know, but they should
make efforts. If one person is suffering,

236
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:12,020
the whole world will suffer for that and this
is what is the culmination of our collectivity.

237
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:19,020
Those who try to keep out of it, you see,
in the collectivity, cannot grow also.

238
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:27,040
About many things I have to say, but specially
I would say that when we see somebody in difficulties,

239
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:34,320
say financial difficulty, at that time we
should try to suggest or try to help that

240
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:41,320
person as just a part and parcel of the whole.
Then that person will realize that I have

241
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:48,970
so many people here. I am not alone. Somebody
might get more, somebody might get less, makes

242
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:56,690
no difference. But the activity of the collective
should be such that you should feel that oneness,

243
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:05,280
that innate feeling for another person, innate.
You not have to think about it, but is innately

244
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:15,860
you should feel attached to that person and
you should feel that you have to do something

245
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:22,860
about it. "After all, why should he not have
the same joy as I have?" So the first thing

246
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:30,720
that you will do, of such people, is normally...
is to help him in his chakras, help him in

247
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,470
his endeavors.

248
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:38,470
It is very easy now to do Sahaja Yoga. In
the olden times, it was very difficult. If

249
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:46,450
you had tried Sahaja Yoga say, in the early
time of Christ, you all might have been crucified.

250
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:51,150
Could be. What did Christ do after all? Why
was He crucified? But nowadays that's not

251
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:58,150
so. Then you... like other saints, any people
in India, "Thousands of years," they said,

252
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:07,710
"we have been meditating. We started our meditation
when we were nothing and now years after years,

253
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:18,150
our different births after births, we have
worked hard to get to this situation, that

254
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:25,150
now we have got realization." You don't have
that problem. There's no problem at all. Except

255
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:33,110
for one, that you have to have full assessment
of yourself, that you are the pure Spirit

256
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,880
and that you are in the kingdom of God. Just
like Christ - it did not matter to Him. He

257
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:49,420
had to oppose something that was wrong, He
did it. When He had to support something was

258
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:55,970
destroyed and saved, He did it. He had nothing
to do with Mary Magdalene, but when people

259
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:02,590
started stoning her, He went and stood before
her and He said, "Those who have not committed

260
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:09,350
any sin, can throw stone at her." See this
courage, this confidence was in Him because

261
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:15,830
He was a divine personality, because of divinity.
But you have become divine. In a way, you

262
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:22,830
know better about life than He knew because
He never touched all these points that you

263
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,320
have touched from what problems you have come
out.

264
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,710
So, you should have much more understanding
for people who are not in Sahaja Yoga or who

265
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,680
want to come to Sahaj Yoga. Like, as soon
as they come to any program, you should not

266
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:39,680
start saying, "You are a bhoot, you are that."
You were a bhoot before you came here. Quite

267
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:50,490
a big bhoot, if you ask Me, I can tell you.
But when you realize what is your importance

268
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:03,910
- now you have become qualified. You know
everything about it. When you know that this

269
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:12,710
has happened, then try just to follow few
rules about Sahaja Yoga. It's very easy for

270
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:20,450
you to follow because you are divine. No problem.
No problem. You can follow it very well, but

271
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:27,440
don't yield to human pressures that still
linger in you or may be in the society. You

272
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:34,440
keep to your own style, to your own behavior
and you'll be amazed that the rest of the

273
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:40,160
world will worship you - not hang you, but
worship you. In your lifetime, it's going

274
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:47,160
to happen. But try to understand that you
are being resurrected for a purpose, and that

275
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:53,590
purpose is to transform this world into a
beautiful place for which all of you should,

276
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:57,120
with full attention, with full understanding
about yourself, about your responsibilities,

277
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,590
should jump into it.

278
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:06,590
Australia has a special responsibility. As
I told you, some are so over-responsible and

279
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:16,750
some are not at all. I can't understand why
it is so, why it (is) happening like that.

280
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:28,210
I see people who are so attentive and some
whose attention is still not all right - moving

281
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:35,460
like this, moving like that. So, you should
try to follow people who have reached a certain

282
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:42,330
height. Try to follow their life, their lifestyle
and then you will be amazed that you can do

283
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:48,780
it very easily because you are mature. It's
like, I have said that we are like an egg

284
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,540
and it has to be hatched once you are mature,
but some chicks come out and just start walking

285
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:58,170
nicely, with little, little legs you see them
very nicely walking towards the mother. And

286
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:05,170
the others are still there covered with all
kinds of filth on them and not able to walk

287
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:15,250
and then these ones who can walk just bring
them, you see, they poke them with their beaks

288
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:20,290
and say, "Come along, come along, come along"
and they bring it to the mother. It's very

289
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,680
interesting. You must watch them.

290
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:28,680
This Easter has a great meaning that we are
now newly born chicks and we have to now follow

291
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:36,360
a new path. It's a very simple path, but still
we are conditioned so we are afraid, maybe,

292
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:42,100
or we have an ego, whatever it is. So drop
out all these things. Just humble down and

293
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:49,100
just start walking on this path of Sahaj and
one day Australia should be able to cover

294
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:56,340
the whole world. I can't see why not? After
all you are the mooladhara and the mooladhara

295
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:03,150
must play its own role as the wisest people.

296
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:10,150
Wisdom is the power that you get from Shri
Ganesh. So you have to be wise, absolutely

297
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:20,690
wise and know that you have been seekers.
You didn't get it because I asked you or we

298
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:24,010
paid you or anything, but you were seekers
struggling to know the truth and that's how

299
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:31,010
you got it and once you have got it, you should
establish it fully in your life and also in

300
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,190
the lives of others. Let others also feel
this gentleman is very unique or this lady

301
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,430
is very unique. She's very different, she's
not selfish, she's not cunning, she doesn't

302
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:32,800
manipulate, but somehow by her character,
by her nature she is trying to create light

303
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,460
for us and enlighten our path, enlighten the
path of others.

304
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:33,760
May God bless you all.

305
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,580
Of course, today we must have Shri Ganesha's
puja for doubly reasons because of Australia

306
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,300
and because of Christ. It's very important
that our Ganesha must be beautifully fixed.

307
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,230
And that His light should really emit in our
day to day lifestyle and also it shows on

308
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,130
our face, in our eyes because you know the
eyes are governed by Christ himself. And where

309
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:44,120
the light comes in, you see, when you get
your realization, the tingling in the eye

310
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,320
comes because of His awakening within us.

311
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:54,710
So, we have to today really pray that we should
have that magnificent character of Christ

312
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,190
which was expressing Ganesha's or manifesting
Ganesha's qualities.

313
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,980
[ASIDE: Attharvasheesh karna chahiye. To per
dhulva do (MEANS Let's do Ganesha Attharvasheesha.

314
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,290
So get the feet washed)]

315
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,380
Now children have to come up here: I think,
say 5 to 10, the children can come up.
