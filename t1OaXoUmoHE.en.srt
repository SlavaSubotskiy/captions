1
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:01,258
Today we have assembled here

2
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:06,467
to worship Sadashiva,

3
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:13,050
which is reflected within us as Shiva, as the spirit.

4
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:20,383
He is reflected in our heart,

5
00:02:22,383 --> 00:02:28,133
and as you have seen

6
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:35,883
that the goal of our life

7
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:43,509
was to achieve this state of spirit.

8
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:52,300
The other day I was reading some books

9
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,133
how it was done,

10
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,841
this Self-realization, to know the spirit,

11
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,300
and how people were tortured.

12
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,217
First of all they're asked to

13
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:28,383
somehow or other deny, defy and condemn their body.

14
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:35,550
Now, if the body wants to have comfort,

15
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:45,342
then it was said that first try to sleep on the carpet,

16
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,509
not on the bed.

17
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:53,425
Then still, it's not enough;

18
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:56,925
then from the carpet you go to a mat

19
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,091
still is not enough.

20
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:03,759
Then from that maybe,

21
00:04:05,175 --> 00:04:07,841
you move down

22
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:12,717
to the Mother Earth,

23
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:15,133
sleep on the Mother Earth.

24
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:19,841
Still if the body is not all right

25
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:24,425
then you start sleeping on the stone.

26
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:28,675
But still the Himalayas are far away,

27
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:31,883
because Shiva resides in Kailasha.

28
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:36,883
So you go to Himalayas and sleep on the ice.

29
00:04:37,217 --> 00:04:41,717
This was the minimum requirement.

30
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:50,425
Then it was said that you are fond of good food,

31
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:55,091
you want to have sumptuous food,

32
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:58,342
you eat a lot, all right;

33
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,467
so you deny everything that you like, to begin with,

34
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:04,592
all that you like.

35
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:08,258
For example, Italians cannot eat pasta!

36
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:18,467
Then deny that.

37
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:22,634
But that's not sufficient.

38
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:26,342
After that you start eating things

39
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,091
which are very bitter.

40
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:32,841
As in the Zen system they give you to eat

41
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:36,883
something which is like quinine raised to power 108,

42
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:42,008
absolutely bitter - or absolutely sweet.

43
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,759
So put your tongue into test.

44
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:50,050
But still the stomach is there.

45
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:53,050
So if you are eating too much,

46
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:56,966
you fast for one day. That's not sufficient.

47
00:05:57,342 --> 00:05:59,300
Then fast for seven days.

48
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:01,425
Then for forty days.

49
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:06,175
I mean, a month has got only thirty days;

50
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:09,425
to fast for forty days means you are already finished.

51
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,634
That's how if you have to do your penance for nirvana.

52
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:16,342
As it is you get a nirvana

53
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:18,841
because you're finished and dead, you see,

54
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:23,634
nothing is left out of you, nothing but bones,

55
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,799
and these bones then become nirvana.

56
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:30,133
Ultimately the death follows,

57
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:31,883
so you are finished and there is nirvana,

58
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,467
no doubt about it.

59
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:38,759
Then you don't live in a house,

60
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:40,841
because house is comfort.

61
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:44,550
Give up your wife, give up your children, give up everyone.

62
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,966
Now wear only one something,

63
00:06:51,217 --> 00:06:53,675
like a cloth tied round,

64
00:06:57,091 --> 00:07:03,717
and go and ask for alms from people.

65
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:13,717
With these clothes also there's still problem,

66
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:16,467
because you're attached to your cloth.

67
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:20,091
So you go to Himalayas where there's nobody to see you,

68
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:21,592
take out your clothes

69
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:26,008
and in that cold you stay there, completely shaking.

70
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:28,133
Then you'll get your nirvana.

71
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:31,300
As it is you get nirvana.

72
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:37,675
All such conditions were put

73
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:46,217
as to destroy the demands of your body to begin with.

74
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,217
You tell your body, "No, nothing doing.

75
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:55,467
You better work out your nirvana."

76
00:07:56,634 --> 00:08:01,550
The second thing was to destroy your mind

77
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:06,883
which takes you to senses,

78
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,342
to things of joy.

79
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:15,008
Supposing you want to have some,

80
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:20,966
something very much,

81
00:08:21,425 --> 00:08:25,550
so deny that, deny that.

82
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:28,091
Anything that your mind tells you,

83
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,175
just say "No, no, no" to it.

84
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:34,425
In Sanskrit

85
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:38,509
the shloka is like this,

86
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,217
"Yat neti neti vachane, nigamo vacha"

87
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:42,592
- which you go on saying,

88
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:46,800
"neti, neti": "No, not this, not this, not this, not this."

89
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:50,342
And then you can discuss about

90
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:53,509
- discuss only, yes - nirvana.

91
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:59,300
Before that you are not even worthy of discussion of nirvana.

92
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:02,925
When I read this book I said,

93
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:06,509
"Baba, I give up. It's too much."

94
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,717
But in Sahaja Yoga

95
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,841
is the other way round,

96
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:19,966
like building first the pinnacle of the building,

97
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,966
and then the foundation.

98
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:28,175
Opening your Sahasrara was the first thing was achieved.

99
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:32,050
And then in the light of Sahasrara

100
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:35,800
you have to watch yourself and see for yourself.

101
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:41,759
Gradually the introspection was a better thing,

102
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:45,509
through vibrations

103
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:50,175
is to see why:

104
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,634
why I want this?

105
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:55,925
Why my attention goes to my comfort?

106
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:58,799
Why my attention goes to food,

107
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:02,300
why to my family, why to my children,

108
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:05,925
when I have to achieve the highest?

109
00:10:06,425 --> 00:10:09,175
So you start introspecting yourself.

110
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,759
Then you know on your vibrations also

111
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,759
there's something wrong with you.

112
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:19,425
Then you don't try to see others,

113
00:10:19,675 --> 00:10:22,799
what's wrong with others, you start seeing yourself;

114
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:28,799
because it's your own ascent

115
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:32,175
you have to achieve.

116
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:37,841
But in the olden times,

117
00:10:38,841 --> 00:10:43,841
all these things were done individually.

118
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:48,342
Like a one person who starts

119
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:51,883
the path of nirvana,

120
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,800
he used to go into ekant, means into lonely places,

121
00:11:01,383 --> 00:11:03,550
stay away from people, avoid them,

122
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:05,300
have nothing to do,

123
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:09,550
and achieve this ascent,

124
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:13,841
Self-realization, only for himself.

125
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,634
It was not for others.

126
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:22,841
Then this gentleman became absolutely exclusive.

127
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:24,841
He wouldn't talk to anyone,

128
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:27,175
he wouldn't meet anybody

129
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:29,008
and he would sit somewhere

130
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:33,883
on top of a remote mountain.

131
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:37,717
Anybody who tried to meet him

132
00:11:37,925 --> 00:11:41,217
he would throw stones or say all kinds of horrible things,

133
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:44,217
and never meet that person.

134
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:52,258
But Sahaja Yoga is not the same thing.

135
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,883
Sahaja Yoga is the ascent of the whole.

136
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:03,133
This kind of singular achievements

137
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:06,133
did not lead people anywhere.

138
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,008
Saints of course tried to talk to people,

139
00:12:11,383 --> 00:12:13,800
tell them about Self-realization, about God,

140
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:18,008
about righteousness, about value system;

141
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:23,550
but they too were regarded as something strange,

142
00:12:24,383 --> 00:12:27,717
and were tortured and troubled.

143
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:35,675
So on the level of an individual ascent,

144
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:38,383
they couldn't do anything for others

145
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,467
except for talking about it, telling about it,

146
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:46,133
till Sahaja Yoga came.

147
00:12:46,717 --> 00:12:50,467
Even the talking about it was prohibited.

148
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:56,133
Till the twelfth century in India

149
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,008
nobody talked about it to the public.

150
00:13:01,675 --> 00:13:03,467
It was all in Sanskrit,

151
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:06,592
very difficult Sanskrit books

152
00:13:07,008 --> 00:13:09,883
which were only available to few aspirants.

153
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:13,217
Was explained to very, very few even,

154
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:18,342
amounting to few numbers of people.

155
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:25,592
But giving realization was denied.

156
00:13:26,883 --> 00:13:30,675
So only one master had one disciple,

157
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,258
and all was the individual ascent,

158
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:36,383
individual working out.

159
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:39,008
Such a disciple was taken away from others

160
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:41,550
and was kept in secret,

161
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:43,841
worked it out on him;

162
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:48,592
and just he may sing, he may write poems,

163
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:51,592
he may talk about it, he might say what his joy is,

164
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:55,799
but he had no right to give realization to anyone,

165
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,841
neither he knew how to give realization.

166
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:04,133
So now you see how far you have gone.

167
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:07,133
You've got your realization

168
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:10,342
without giving up much.

169
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:15,592
You can work on a much wider scale,

170
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:18,467
you can give realizations to other.

171
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,342
You know about all the subtle knowledge

172
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:26,550
about Sahaja Yoga.

173
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:31,217
But today I'm going to tell you something more

174
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:33,925
which we have to know.

175
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,342
It's very important to know,

176
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,509
because as was described by people

177
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,509
that they practice Sahaja Yoga as they go to church,

178
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,634
but it's not from their heart.

179
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,759
And heart is the abode of the spirit

180
00:15:03,091 --> 00:15:06,925
- is the Shiva within us.

181
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:11,550
So we have to know more about heart,

182
00:15:12,175 --> 00:15:15,925
and that is very important.

183
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,258
You know about these three nadis we have:

184
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:22,509
Ida, Pingala, Sushumna;

185
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:26,592
but in the heart there are four nadis.

186
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:34,759
And the one nadi goes to Mooladhara,

187
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:42,008
and if you cross the limits of Mooladhara it goes to hell.

188
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:46,675
That's why they say that Shiva is a destroyer.

189
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:50,841
Actually you ask for your destruction.

190
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:57,799
And when you ask for your destruction, you have it.

191
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:06,342
Even if it destroys everything, as I was telling,

192
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:11,091
it's like when a fruit has to come,

193
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:15,091
the petals look as if they're destroyed

194
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:18,091
- as I have destroyed, I would say, many of your things:

195
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:21,050
you can call it like your conditionings,

196
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:23,634
your ego, your racialism, your fanaticism.

197
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,091
All this has been destroyed in Sahaja Yoga.

198
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,175
This has to be destroyed

199
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:33,799
for the beauty to come out.

200
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:41,091
So when your maryadas

201
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,175
you cross beyond certain point,

202
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,258
you go to your destruction.

203
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,091
In four directions there are destructions built,

204
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,425
as there are four nadis.

205
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,717
So now, what is to be done?

206
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,759
How are we to stop this destruction of the,

207
00:17:10,175 --> 00:17:13,509
through the first nadi, going to hell?

208
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,509
One of the qualities of Shiva is that He's innocence.

209
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:23,509
He's extremely innocent. He's innocent like a child.

210
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:26,925
He is innocence personified.

211
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,133
So

212
00:17:34,883 --> 00:17:41,467
we have to put our carnal desires,

213
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,425
dissolve them,

214
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:51,966
dissolve them into the innocence,

215
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:55,592
the ocean of innocence.

216
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,883
You have to dissolve it in the ocean of innocence.

217
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:10,883
Innocence is something to be appreciated,

218
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:15,425
to be understood, to be enjoyed.

219
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:19,550
Like you see animals, they're innocent;

220
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,300
you see children, they're innocent;

221
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:28,300
flowers, they're innocent.

222
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:33,592
Divert your attention

223
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:38,425
to all these things.

224
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,258
You see, on walking on the street,

225
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:49,759
what is there to see best

226
00:18:50,091 --> 00:18:53,841
is all at three feet height.

227
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,759
You see at three feet height all the flowers,

228
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:01,091
all the beautiful grass,

229
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:05,799
all the children who are about three feet are the best.

230
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,425
You need not see people who are above that.

231
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:17,050
Just see on three feet level.

232
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:25,550
You can see the legs of somebody, that's all right.

233
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:30,425
But you don't see the eyes of a person

234
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,675
who are not innocent.

235
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:38,133
So dissolve this desire

236
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:42,300
into innocence.

237
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:46,925
And this Mooladhara which is innocent

238
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,509
is not dead, finished, but is innocent,

239
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:55,966
it is righteous,

240
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:59,050
it is Shri Ganesha's qualities,

241
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:03,383
it's pure.

242
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,925
So even if you are in this world,

243
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:08,592
even if you are living like a human being,

244
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:11,383
even if you have children,

245
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:15,258
still you are innocent.

246
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:22,383
Like once the wives of Shri Krishna

247
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,717
- He had sixteen thousand wives to begin with,

248
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,008
and the five more.

249
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:30,133
The sixteen thousand were His powers,

250
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:33,300
and five were the elements.

251
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:41,759
They were wanting to go to pray to some big well-known,

252
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:48,300
I should say, saint had come, a maharshi had come.

253
00:20:48,675 --> 00:20:52,217
So they wanted to go and see him and pay respects.

254
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:56,217
So they asked Shri Krishna's permission,

255
00:20:56,592 --> 00:21:00,799
but when they went they found the river was all in spate,

256
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,300
so flooded they could not cross over.

257
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,634
They came back, they said,

258
00:21:07,925 --> 00:21:12,883
"How can we cross over this river? It's all in spate."

259
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,133
So this Krishna said,

260
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:17,258
"All right, you just go and say,

261
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:22,008
РІР‚В˜If Shri Krishna is Yogeshwara,

262
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:27,841
and if He is absolutely innocent about sex,

263
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,592
you go down.'"

264
00:21:34,717 --> 00:21:36,425
They said, "How can we? We are so many wives.

265
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:39,008
What is He talking about?"

266
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:43,175
So they went down and said this to the river,

267
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:46,300
and the river went down, and they were surprised that

268
00:21:46,717 --> 00:21:50,925
"this husband of ours is saying all these things."

269
00:21:54,883 --> 00:21:59,759
They went across and worshipped that rishi

270
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,759
and they were coming back, again the river was in floods.

271
00:22:06,717 --> 00:22:08,467
So they went back to the rishi, said,

272
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:11,175
"Now how are we to cross over because it's in floods?"

273
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:12,759
He said, "How did you come?"

274
00:22:13,008 --> 00:22:15,925
So they told the story of Shri Krishna.

275
00:22:16,592 --> 00:22:19,467
Now they had fed this rishi with food and fruits

276
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,592
and he had eaten such a lot.

277
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,383
"All right, you go and tell this river that

278
00:22:26,717 --> 00:22:29,799
this rishi has not eaten at all anything."

279
00:22:30,217 --> 00:22:32,342
They said, "How can it be? Just now you ate before us."

280
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,217
He said, "Just go and see."

281
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:40,175
They went back and told this to the river.

282
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:45,300
The river again went down.

283
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:50,550
So to live in this world,

284
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:53,550
to be a wife or to be a husband,

285
00:22:53,883 --> 00:22:59,008
to be married, whatever it is,

286
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:03,634
you can be innocent,

287
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:07,467
absolutely innocent about it.

288
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:11,175
That's the sign of your purity.

289
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:19,467
The second nadi, the second channel

290
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:23,342
that can take you to destruction is desire.

291
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:26,966
That's why Buddha has said that desirelessness

292
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:31,091
is the only way that people do not get old,

293
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:33,799
nor sick,

294
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:37,675
nor worried.

295
00:23:41,425 --> 00:23:44,966
Now this desire that we have,

296
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,759
"I want this,"

297
00:23:47,966 --> 00:23:51,300
in the West is much more than anywhere else

298
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:53,799
because the entrepreneurs are every day

299
00:23:54,091 --> 00:23:56,342
producing new things.

300
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,425
Say for example a hairdress,

301
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,342
so the women want to buy this wig or that wig,

302
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:06,841
"It's my desire, I must have this wig to put on my head."

303
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,217
The another one says, "All right, I must have this one."

304
00:24:13,217 --> 00:24:19,300
And the desire, for men, is "Oh, if he is having

305
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:23,175
a Rolls Royce, why shouldn't I have one?"

306
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:29,425
They cannot enjoy somebody else's Rolls Royce.

307
00:24:31,342 --> 00:24:36,509
It should be your own, that "I should have the possession."

308
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:42,425
Desires can be of any kind, not only material.

309
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:48,008
The desires could be also

310
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:50,675
quite mental,

311
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:55,550
"I must possess this woman,

312
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:58,883
I must possess this child."

313
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:04,217
All kinds of possessions that work into you as desires.

314
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:09,008
But I wouldn't say it is because of attachment.

315
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:15,467
It's not attachment, but it is just to have more.

316
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:28,675
Go on adding up things, getting things

317
00:25:32,342 --> 00:25:36,467
- still one doesn't feel happy and satisfied.

318
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:41,008
What is the reason

319
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:46,634
for this kind of a desire is that it's not pure desire.

320
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:50,133
It's an impure desire.

321
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,342
It's an impure desire,

322
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,800
and when such a desire starts working

323
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:57,133
you can go any far,

324
00:25:57,509 --> 00:25:59,925
like Saddam Hussein, like Hitler,

325
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:01,759
like anything is nothing

326
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:06,592
but absolutely desire beyond

327
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,509
any limitations.

328
00:26:12,383 --> 00:26:15,008
You want to dominate others

329
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:19,383
is also another desire.

330
00:26:21,925 --> 00:26:24,050
All these desires

331
00:26:25,175 --> 00:26:28,925
lead you ultimately to a destruction,

332
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:33,342
because there's no joy,

333
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,883
there's no happiness.

334
00:26:37,925 --> 00:26:44,050
For example, now I want to have a sari,

335
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:50,175
so I want to buy a sari.

336
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:54,050
All my attention will be how will I get that sari,

337
00:26:54,383 --> 00:26:56,509
I must get that sari, this thing, that thing.

338
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,592
The attention becomes polluted,

339
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:06,175
disturbed, for a nonsensical thing like a sari.

340
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:10,592
The attention which has to enjoy,

341
00:27:11,925 --> 00:27:15,258
which has to enjoy the spirit,

342
00:27:16,883 --> 00:27:19,467
which has to nourish the spirit,

343
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:25,759
becomes disturbed because of desires.

344
00:27:27,634 --> 00:27:30,800
In the first place the attention

345
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:35,008
is disturbed because we are not innocent.

346
00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:40,133
In the second place the attention

347
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:45,342
gets into turmoil because we have desire.

348
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:55,383
So what should we do as far as the desire is concerned?

349
00:27:59,342 --> 00:28:02,133
The desire for beautiful things

350
00:28:04,258 --> 00:28:08,175
- we can shift our desire,

351
00:28:09,008 --> 00:28:11,800
material desire into aesthetics,

352
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:16,759
and have one thing but which is really aesthetically rich;

353
00:28:18,592 --> 00:28:21,467
because that's the quality of Shiva,

354
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,467
that He gives aesthetics to everything.

355
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,050
Now supposing this looks very plain,

356
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:31,717
simple and one may say that mechanical.

357
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:34,467
But if it was Shiva's job

358
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:38,050
He would have done something beautiful about it.

359
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,467
So the quality of Shiva is that He beautifies everything

360
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:48,717
that is created by Brahmadeva,

361
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,717
evolved by Vishnu.

362
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,342
He's the one who does

363
00:28:56,675 --> 00:28:59,717
the subtle work of creating aesthetics.

364
00:29:00,175 --> 00:29:02,217
You've seen My photographs many a times

365
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:06,759
with so many lights, this, that - is all His job.

366
00:29:07,091 --> 00:29:08,467
He's doing it.

367
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,467
He throws lights in such a manner,

368
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,342
He works out in such a manner.

369
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:17,509
Just He wants to convince you about Me.

370
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,342
It's His job.

371
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:23,342
So His job is to create aesthetics:

372
00:29:25,217 --> 00:29:27,841
aesthetics of behavior,

373
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:32,717
aesthetics of poetry.

374
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,966
Everything that is created is made beautiful,

375
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,217
is joy-giving, by Shiva - that's His quality.

376
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:49,966
So whatever you desire,

377
00:29:50,258 --> 00:29:53,675
if you start working it out,

378
00:29:56,008 --> 00:30:02,008
desiring for something aesthetically handmade, nice thing,

379
00:30:06,425 --> 00:30:08,592
gradually you'll find

380
00:30:08,966 --> 00:30:11,342
you'll end up with vibrations,

381
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:15,300
because all beautiful things have vibrations.

382
00:30:17,592 --> 00:30:19,133
And to have the vibrations

383
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:22,592
you'll have to go to pure desire.

384
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:27,008
So this desire which is madness,

385
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,675
which makes you mad,

386
00:30:30,091 --> 00:30:35,675
which is so much dull and boring

387
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:41,550
becomes pure desire, because you have to dissolve

388
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:44,091
all your desires into vibration.

389
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:48,300
You start desiring nothing but vibrations after some time.

390
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:53,509
You'll not buy anything which has no vibrations.

391
00:30:53,966 --> 00:30:57,091
You'll not talk to a person who has no vibrations.

392
00:30:57,841 --> 00:31:01,425
If somebody has [no] vibrations you'll just run away.

393
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:10,717
I've seen people running away

394
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,800
from some people

395
00:31:13,091 --> 00:31:17,258
as if some monkey is after them.

396
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,675
When I look around,

397
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:20,550
I find there are people who are drunkard,

398
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,050
or somebody coming or something.

399
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:26,675
They might have been drunkard themselves once upon a time,

400
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:28,383
but now they run away,

401
00:31:28,717 --> 00:31:32,759
"No, no, no, no. Not so now. Now no, no more."

402
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:37,258
We had three, four hippies to begin

403
00:31:37,634 --> 00:31:39,717
with who came with Me to India.

404
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,841
They're normal like you, they were become,

405
00:31:42,175 --> 00:31:43,799
you see, Sahaja yogis.

406
00:31:44,091 --> 00:31:48,008
And four, five hippies came to My program,

407
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:50,300
it was in Rahuri, I think.

408
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:54,966
They got a fright of their life, "Oh no, oh, God!"

409
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:56,675
I said, "What's the matter with you?

410
00:31:56,883 --> 00:31:58,592
Why are you so frightened?"

411
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,841
So I turned round to see these hippies,

412
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:04,091
and by the time I'd turned round they were out.

413
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:07,717
They were no more there.

414
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:14,425
So then what happens, all desire ends up into chaitanya,

415
00:32:15,008 --> 00:32:17,133
into vibrations.

416
00:32:17,425 --> 00:32:18,509
And if it does not,

417
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,966
then you must know there's something still missing.

418
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,258
But if you do not do this,

419
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:28,759
then you end up into your destruction.

420
00:32:29,966 --> 00:32:33,592
So to say that He's a destroyer

421
00:32:33,925 --> 00:32:38,300
is a very one-sided statement.

422
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:42,800
He has both the powers.

423
00:32:43,258 --> 00:32:47,008
He has the power to give you vibrations.

424
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,592
He gives you vibrations.

425
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,925
The Goddess is the power, Shakti,

426
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,717
but He makes the vibrations.

427
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:04,841
It's like these are the fingers, all right,

428
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,841
but if they tickle you then it's Shiva.

429
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,717
The fingers are that of the Goddess, all right,

430
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:19,800
but if it tickles, you know, gives you joy,

431
00:33:20,175 --> 00:33:24,759
happiness, it's Shiva, is the bhakti.

432
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,800
The joy of bhakti comes from Shiva.

433
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:34,592
Today only I was explaining

434
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:38,050
how one lady who was a Devi bhakt

435
00:33:38,592 --> 00:33:41,217
and has done so much study of bhakti

436
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,550
and all that and knew so much,

437
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,008
just merged into Me.

438
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,925
I just couldn't understand her how, what she has done,

439
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:53,050
because normally people don't do.

440
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,175
When they are reading about Devi they think,

441
00:33:55,425 --> 00:33:56,966
"All right, this is Devi, this is Mataji."

442
00:33:57,217 --> 00:33:59,091
You see, it's separate things.

443
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:02,550
They don't know they are reading about Devi.

444
00:34:04,091 --> 00:34:06,425
So she said, "Mother, I just identified.

445
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:09,675
It's written that how You are gentle,

446
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,675
the Goddess is gentle, how She touches me,

447
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,759
how She looks after me,

448
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,425
how Her attention is on me."

449
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:21,550
Like there's a sentence "kataksha, kataksha, nirikshana:

450
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:24,175
every glance is an inspection."

451
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,425
But "inspection" not a very good word,

452
00:34:26,759 --> 00:34:30,300
but "nirikshana" means inspection, divine inspection.

453
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:35,300
"So all the time I feel that it's You, You,

454
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:39,050
You are all the time - when I listen to music

455
00:34:39,383 --> 00:34:42,467
I feel now, see, She is looking at me,

456
00:34:42,883 --> 00:34:46,383
She is feeling me, She is nourishing me.

457
00:34:46,925 --> 00:34:50,175
All the time I feel Your love."

458
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,509
That's how the bhakti comes in.

459
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:56,258
So if you have vibrations

460
00:34:56,634 --> 00:35:00,841
that doesn't mean that they are something dry, you see?

461
00:35:02,091 --> 00:35:04,175
No,

462
00:35:04,509 --> 00:35:08,509
it means the joy of bhakti.

463
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:14,759
Bhakti is, you can call it adoration, this, that.

464
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:20,091
It's the ocean of love that is God.

465
00:35:21,091 --> 00:35:22,799
You just get drenched into it.

466
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:25,550
There's no words to it.

467
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:31,759
And that is what when you feel,

468
00:35:31,966 --> 00:35:34,342
you must know that

469
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:39,050
you have taken the spirit

470
00:35:40,509 --> 00:35:44,634
as a real connection

471
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,300
between you and your Mother,

472
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:52,966
or your Father.

473
00:35:54,925 --> 00:36:00,425
There's no differentiation.

474
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:06,175
You are one

475
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:09,175
in that ocean, drenched in the ocean.

476
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,217
You are the drop, you are the ocean.

477
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:15,799
You are one in that bhakti.

478
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:20,799
And that bhakti cannot be mechanical,

479
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:26,841
because not man-made.

480
00:36:30,175 --> 00:36:34,799
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga

481
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:40,091
you must know that it's not dry vibrations only,

482
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:43,425
but is the bhakti.

483
00:36:44,258 --> 00:36:46,717
That is the joy

484
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:49,342
of Shiva's quality,

485
00:36:49,717 --> 00:36:53,133
the quality of joy that He adds

486
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,675
to our life.

487
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:01,550
Everything seems to be surrounded, resounding.

488
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,883
Same thing the joy,

489
00:37:04,217 --> 00:37:06,883
that "I'm loved so much by God,

490
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,342
that God loves me,

491
00:37:09,675 --> 00:37:12,592
that I have a meaning in life."

492
00:37:14,091 --> 00:37:19,091
Then the ego drops out first of all,

493
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:26,133
and also the conditionings drop out.

494
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:33,091
Now the third nadi:

495
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,800
third nadi

496
00:37:42,342 --> 00:37:46,258
is the nadi by which we feel attached,

497
00:37:48,258 --> 00:37:50,258
attached to someone.

498
00:37:50,592 --> 00:37:54,925
Like this is my child, this is my husband,

499
00:37:55,509 --> 00:37:57,634
this is my family,

500
00:37:57,925 --> 00:38:00,175
this is my wife,

501
00:38:00,883 --> 00:38:04,342
this is my father, this is my mother.

502
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:10,383
In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga of everyone,

503
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:13,883
when they are just the beginners,

504
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:18,800
so they talk about their whole family,

505
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,509
"My father is like this,

506
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,759
my mother is sick, my mother's sister's brother's

507
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:30,008
this, that's real, this thing, is not well."

508
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,383
As if, you see, we all have taken a contract.

509
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:40,258
What should I do?

510
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:46,217
Like today somebody said that "You see,

511
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,550
they lost their first child.

512
00:38:49,925 --> 00:38:52,008
First child they lost,

513
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:55,717
because the child was sleeping in another room."

514
00:38:55,925 --> 00:38:59,759
I said, "Small children should sleep with mother,

515
00:39:00,008 --> 00:39:01,925
and mother must look after the children."

516
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:03,467
It's simple thing - I mean,

517
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,300
in India no mother would accept such a situation.

518
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:08,133
She'll throw away the husband,

519
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:11,675
say, "What's this? I have to look after the child."

520
00:39:12,008 --> 00:39:16,717
So I said, "Tell them that they should sleep with the child."

521
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:19,467
But they don't believe in it.

522
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:21,883
So all right - what can we do?

523
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:25,008
Have we taken their contract that

524
00:39:25,342 --> 00:39:27,258
we should look after their children,

525
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:30,883
even when they don't want to listen to us?

526
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:37,799
So the idea is, all the time in the beginning is that

527
00:39:38,091 --> 00:39:42,091
"Oh Mother, I've been doing Sahaja Yoga for one month,

528
00:39:42,425 --> 00:39:47,217
but so far my financial condition has not improved."

529
00:39:48,217 --> 00:39:51,133
As if they're going to sue Me for that,

530
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:56,008
as if I've let them down.

531
00:39:59,008 --> 00:40:00,675
But they don't want to see that

532
00:40:00,883 --> 00:40:03,091
you have just now come to Sahaja Yoga,

533
00:40:03,425 --> 00:40:05,717
or even if you have been in Sahaja Yoga for so many years,

534
00:40:05,966 --> 00:40:08,799
you have not been a Sahaja yogi.

535
00:40:09,217 --> 00:40:11,675
Something missing, you don't deserve.

536
00:40:11,966 --> 00:40:14,966
Something wrong with you, not with Sahaja Yoga.

537
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:18,966
But they feel that Sahaja Yoga

538
00:40:19,425 --> 00:40:23,550
is something which has got the contract.

539
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,300
Immediately they'll inform you,

540
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:26,634
"Now somebody is sick there,

541
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,717
somebody's somebody's somebody's somebody.

542
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:33,925
Send five Sahaja yogis." For what?

543
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:41,050
These attachments start working within us.

544
00:40:41,883 --> 00:40:44,550
Now some people I've seen

545
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:48,883
are very attached to their children

546
00:40:49,675 --> 00:40:55,841
and they go on pampering, "Oh, my child, my child."

547
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:57,841
And suddenly they discover

548
00:40:58,091 --> 00:41:01,634
the child is now is a devil's child.

549
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,841
The child starts answering back,

550
00:41:05,175 --> 00:41:07,841
saying all kinds of things, beating the parents,

551
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:11,258
misbehaving, and then they suddenly discover

552
00:41:11,717 --> 00:41:14,800
that "this is the child whom I have been looking after,

553
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,133
giving so much love."

554
00:41:16,425 --> 00:41:18,050
And they feel even worse,

555
00:41:18,383 --> 00:41:21,800
because "I have done so much for my wife,

556
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:23,300
and she is treating me like this."

557
00:41:23,634 --> 00:41:25,841
"I've done so much for my husband,

558
00:41:26,175 --> 00:41:27,383
and he is treating me like this."

559
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:29,258
Why do you do so much?

560
00:41:29,509 --> 00:41:30,966
There's no need.

561
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,383
And if you are doing it, you just do it and you forget it.

562
00:41:36,509 --> 00:41:37,800
I never feel that way.

563
00:41:38,175 --> 00:41:40,759
I know of Sahaja yogis for whom I have worked very hard,

564
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,717
and they have gone down.

565
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,258
Only thing if I feel anything,

566
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,300
only God knows where will they jump?

567
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:48,133
Where will they be in hell?

568
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:51,133
What will happen to them? That's the only concern.

569
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,133
Not the concern what has happened,

570
00:41:53,383 --> 00:41:55,799
because nothing can \happen to Me.

571
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:00,634
But if they have been sinful

572
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:05,509
I just get worried about their future,

573
00:42:05,883 --> 00:42:08,925
about their lives. That's different.

574
00:42:09,383 --> 00:42:11,925
So this kind of attachment that is we call in Sanskrit is

575
00:42:12,258 --> 00:42:14,800
"mamatva" - "this is mine, that's my child,

576
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:18,258
my this thing, my that."

577
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:24,800
Who are your relations are Sahaja yogis - remember this.

578
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:26,883
It's a sentence you must remember,

579
00:42:27,217 --> 00:42:30,258
"My relations are Sahaja yogis only.

580
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:35,008
And anybody who plays against Sahaja yogis,

581
00:42:35,342 --> 00:42:38,217
troubles Sahaja yogis - that person could be my own wife,

582
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:42,050
could be my own child - is not mine."

583
00:42:43,467 --> 00:42:46,925
Because I'll not allow such a thing to happen.

584
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:50,800
This relationship is all right till

585
00:42:51,258 --> 00:42:55,258
Sahaja yogis are one with each other.

586
00:42:55,592 --> 00:43:00,258
As soon as somebody tries to harm any other Sahaja yogi,

587
00:43:00,717 --> 00:43:02,799
then I'm not with that person.

588
00:43:03,008 --> 00:43:04,509
I've seen there are many like that,

589
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,342
but very good Sahaja yogis.

590
00:43:06,675 --> 00:43:08,050
They'll never side with their wives,

591
00:43:08,342 --> 00:43:10,383
never side with their children,

592
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,008
because they know if you are siding with them

593
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:19,383
you are making them sinful, you're destroying them.

594
00:43:19,883 --> 00:43:21,467
They're worried about their ascent

595
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,800
so they'll never allow, never allow anybody,

596
00:43:25,217 --> 00:43:28,799
a relation of theirs to trouble others.

597
00:43:30,467 --> 00:43:32,675
I have seen some children

598
00:43:33,258 --> 00:43:35,675
who are extremely naughty,

599
00:43:35,925 --> 00:43:38,800
they're very troublesome, very violent,

600
00:43:39,592 --> 00:43:41,800
and the parents just saying, "Mother, put them right.

601
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:45,133
We leave it to You." They are to be put right.

602
00:43:45,467 --> 00:43:46,509
But others will say,

603
00:43:46,799 --> 00:43:49,258
"Oh, no, no, no, no; you see my child,

604
00:43:49,675 --> 00:43:53,008
he cannot do such a thing, you know."

605
00:43:55,592 --> 00:44:00,675
So one has to understand the discrimination part of it,

606
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:04,675
that "Why am I attached?"

607
00:44:06,008 --> 00:44:07,799
I've given this simile many a times,

608
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,883
like the sap of the tree rises,

609
00:44:10,217 --> 00:44:13,675
goes to various places of the trees, various areas,

610
00:44:13,883 --> 00:44:17,217
looks after the bark, looks after the branch,

611
00:44:17,509 --> 00:44:19,383
looks after the leaves,

612
00:44:19,634 --> 00:44:21,425
flowers and fruits, and comes back,

613
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,841
or it gets evaporated. It doesn't get attached.

614
00:44:25,592 --> 00:44:27,841
If it gets involved into one of them

615
00:44:28,175 --> 00:44:29,425
the whole tree will die,

616
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:32,759
and that part which

617
00:44:33,133 --> 00:44:37,966
is so close to the sap will also die.

618
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:41,592
But sap has much more sense than we have.

619
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:48,217
To them, husband's so important

620
00:44:48,467 --> 00:44:51,675
- I mean so many problems of husbands, wives, this, that.

621
00:44:51,966 --> 00:44:55,091
"My God," I sometimes think, "What is this?"

622
00:44:55,383 --> 00:44:58,091
That's why they used to say, "Take a sanyas"

623
00:44:58,383 --> 00:45:00,008
- so nobody can talk about wife,

624
00:45:00,342 --> 00:45:01,592
children, nothing.

625
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,800
You have to be a sanyasi, first of all be a sanyasi.

626
00:45:06,217 --> 00:45:07,509
So no headache to the guru.

627
00:45:07,883 --> 00:45:09,258
As soon as you start talking

628
00:45:09,592 --> 00:45:12,217
about any one relation of yours, the guru would say,

629
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:16,217
"All right, you get out. Nothing doing. No good."

630
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:21,759
But in Sahaja Yoga -

631
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:26,050
Sahaja Yoga has much deeper

632
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,258
work to do.

633
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:30,425
It has to penetrate into the society,

634
00:45:30,717 --> 00:45:32,717
into the political life, into economic life.

635
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:34,799
You have to emancipate the whole world.

636
00:45:35,091 --> 00:45:37,342
Try to understand your responsibility.

637
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,759
You are not only here for one ascetic ascent, no.

638
00:45:47,258 --> 00:45:49,258
How much wisdom you must have,

639
00:45:49,717 --> 00:45:51,509
how much love you must have,

640
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,008
and how much discrimination you must have,

641
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,966
to understand that you are chosen

642
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,300
for the emancipation of the whole world.

643
00:46:04,175 --> 00:46:07,925
So now this so-called limited love,

644
00:46:08,425 --> 00:46:11,592
what is the solution which takes you to destruction

645
00:46:11,925 --> 00:46:15,050
is the unlimited love.

646
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:21,509
Because Shiva is nothing but love, He's love.

647
00:46:24,966 --> 00:46:30,383
Love is that corrects, that nourishes,

648
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,300
that wants your benevolence.

649
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,509
That's what Shiva is.

650
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,841
It wants your benevolence.

651
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,925
It looks after your benevolence.

652
00:46:47,592 --> 00:46:51,634
So when

653
00:46:52,717 --> 00:46:57,759
you are looking after the benevolence of others with love,

654
00:47:00,634 --> 00:47:04,133
then the whole life changes,

655
00:47:06,383 --> 00:47:09,300
the whole pattern changes,

656
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,258
and you really enjoy it because

657
00:47:12,634 --> 00:47:14,800
you become one with so many,

658
00:47:15,175 --> 00:47:17,966
concerned with so many families, so many things,

659
00:47:18,383 --> 00:47:22,675
so many problems of others,

660
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:25,799
and you just feel you are one with so many.

661
00:47:26,133 --> 00:47:29,592
Now see, we are so many Sahaja yogis here today.

662
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,675
First time when I came to Italy,

663
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:35,509
I must tell you,

664
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:39,133
I came with Christine - no,

665
00:47:39,467 --> 00:47:43,008
what's the name of Gregoire's wife? Catherine.

666
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:46,467
And she was the only one who knew Italian.

667
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:48,675
And we had told some newspaper

668
00:47:49,008 --> 00:47:52,217
to reserve some sort of a hall and advertise for us.

669
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,008
Nothing was done.

670
00:47:54,342 --> 00:47:57,217
So when we came we couldn't find anyone.

671
00:47:57,592 --> 00:48:00,799
So I went round with her to put the posters,

672
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:03,841
but still nobody came.

673
00:48:04,425 --> 00:48:06,717
And today we are so many.

674
00:48:07,091 --> 00:48:11,425
But we must know that we are bound to each other by love,

675
00:48:14,675 --> 00:48:20,133
and the love that is for our benevolence, for our ascent.

676
00:48:22,217 --> 00:48:26,425
And then you just start enjoying everyone.

677
00:48:27,592 --> 00:48:29,883
And then you don't think what race you are,

678
00:48:30,133 --> 00:48:32,133
what country you are, what this thing you are,

679
00:48:32,383 --> 00:48:34,467
nothing - a Sahaja yogi, finished!

680
00:48:34,799 --> 00:48:38,383
So you become a universal being.

681
00:48:39,592 --> 00:48:42,342
And this attitude has to be achieved.

682
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:44,925
When I hear that some Indian girls

683
00:48:45,342 --> 00:48:49,258
are tortured and troubled, I think, "How can they do it?"

684
00:48:49,717 --> 00:48:53,800
Or somebody who has a black skin, they are tortured;

685
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,966
or some Indians are treating somebody

686
00:48:57,383 --> 00:48:59,509
because they are of low caste.

687
00:48:59,841 --> 00:49:01,634
It's not possible,

688
00:49:01,925 --> 00:49:04,841
because they are all part and parcel of one body.

689
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:10,091
They're all brothers and sisters, born of the same Mother.

690
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,966
But this is only possible

691
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:17,258
when you dissolve that limited relationship of yours

692
00:49:17,634 --> 00:49:20,425
into this great unlimited ocean of love;

693
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,800
then only it is possible.

694
00:49:23,258 --> 00:49:26,050
And if it is not there, do not try to justify

695
00:49:26,425 --> 00:49:28,800
- just watch yourself.

696
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:34,841
See for yourself: are you really in love with everyone?

697
00:49:36,383 --> 00:49:40,258
You see, I would say that

698
00:49:41,383 --> 00:49:44,133
all the time when I - sometimes I go for shopping,

699
00:49:44,383 --> 00:49:47,759
I just think, "Oh, this one would be nice for this one,

700
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:50,509
that will be nice for that one."

701
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,717
For Myself if you say,

702
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,425
it's impossible for Me to buy anything for Myself,

703
00:49:55,717 --> 00:49:59,133
impossible situation.

704
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,425
Unless and until it is absolutely immediate,

705
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:07,717
or some problem is there if I am just without it.

706
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:10,759
I won't even buy a drink for Myself,

707
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,467
even if I am thirsty.

708
00:50:12,841 --> 00:50:15,799
Because the whole thing is the joy of others.

709
00:50:16,175 --> 00:50:18,759
"Oh, this will be nice for that person.

710
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:21,634
This will be good for that person."

711
00:50:25,799 --> 00:50:30,550
All this is the most enjoyable thing.

712
00:50:30,799 --> 00:50:33,883
I mean, why all this is for there?

713
00:50:34,342 --> 00:50:36,091
After all, think about yourself,

714
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:39,342
"Why am I here?

715
00:50:41,759 --> 00:50:45,300
I'm here to enjoy everyone - everyone.

716
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:48,675
They are all realized souls,

717
00:50:49,342 --> 00:50:52,550
such beautiful lotuses.

718
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,175
I'm not going to stoop down to the mud.

719
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:00,550
Now I am a lotus."

720
00:51:03,425 --> 00:51:08,883
That is the way you open the heart,

721
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:13,759
the lotus of your heart.

722
00:51:14,091 --> 00:51:18,799
And the fragrance of such a person is so beautiful,

723
00:51:20,008 --> 00:51:24,342
is so beautiful.

724
00:51:26,342 --> 00:51:28,883
So you are no more divisive,

725
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,634
you do not want to separate from each other.

726
00:51:31,883 --> 00:51:36,217
Anywhere is done, you are agreeable to that;

727
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:38,342
you don't think that it should be done here

728
00:51:38,675 --> 00:51:40,759
or there or there, but anywhere

729
00:51:40,966 --> 00:51:45,550
- but should be all of us together.

730
00:51:47,175 --> 00:51:51,759
So the small attachments that are with you

731
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:56,008
have to be dissolved into this ocean of love,

732
00:51:56,342 --> 00:51:59,841
which is Shiva.

733
00:52:05,592 --> 00:52:08,883
Fourth one is the most important

734
00:52:09,425 --> 00:52:11,675
for all of us is to know

735
00:52:12,008 --> 00:52:15,883
that there's a nadi which passes through left Vishuddhi

736
00:52:17,258 --> 00:52:19,091
into the heart.

737
00:52:19,342 --> 00:52:22,675
Starts from the heart, goes up,

738
00:52:23,467 --> 00:52:25,550
passes through Agnya.

739
00:52:25,883 --> 00:52:29,592
It has four petals, and opens up.

740
00:52:34,592 --> 00:52:37,675
This is the one which gives

741
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:42,091
you the state which is called as turya.

742
00:52:42,467 --> 00:52:46,550
We live in three states.

743
00:52:46,841 --> 00:52:50,342
In the living - in the awakened state,

744
00:52:50,675 --> 00:52:54,759
jagruti, our attention goes to this, that, and all that;

745
00:52:54,966 --> 00:52:57,550
we spoil our attention.

746
00:53:00,091 --> 00:53:04,425
But the second one is the one what we call

747
00:53:04,759 --> 00:53:06,467
is that we sleep.

748
00:53:06,675 --> 00:53:10,425
When we sleep also

749
00:53:11,383 --> 00:53:12,925
all these things that have happened

750
00:53:13,217 --> 00:53:16,091
come to us from our past and things like that.

751
00:53:18,217 --> 00:53:22,091
But then we go to the deeper sleep called as sushupti.

752
00:53:23,759 --> 00:53:27,300
Is a state where

753
00:53:28,217 --> 00:53:30,550
you have deep sleep,

754
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:34,634
and you dream of something that is reality also.

755
00:53:35,634 --> 00:53:38,759
You may dream about Me.

756
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:43,841
Like it's the ethereal part of the subconscious,

757
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:48,509
where some beautiful

758
00:53:48,841 --> 00:53:50,550
informations are passed on.

759
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,050
Supposing I've come, say, to Italy.

760
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,175
Italians might know in their sushupti

761
00:53:55,509 --> 00:53:57,966
that I have come here, or maybe anybody might know

762
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,966
- depends on.

763
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,175
But the fourth state is called as turya.

764
00:54:02,425 --> 00:54:03,759
There are two more states.

765
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,925
You are in the turya state, it's the fourth,

766
00:54:06,258 --> 00:54:07,966
"turya" means fourth.

767
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:12,050
Fourth state is where that you are

768
00:54:12,425 --> 00:54:15,509
in a thoughtless awareness state.

769
00:54:17,133 --> 00:54:21,966
When there is no thought - just think of it

770
00:54:22,966 --> 00:54:27,050
- when there is no thought, you have to be innocent.

771
00:54:27,925 --> 00:54:32,425
When there is no thought, you have to have vibrations.

772
00:54:33,383 --> 00:54:37,300
When there is no thought, you cannot be attached to anyone.

773
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,717
So into that thoughtless state you have come now,

774
00:54:40,966 --> 00:54:42,634
is the "turya sthiti."

775
00:54:42,925 --> 00:54:46,634
And in this state when you are,

776
00:54:48,425 --> 00:54:52,717
these four petals which are within you

777
00:54:53,258 --> 00:54:57,050
have to open out in your brain.

778
00:54:58,759 --> 00:55:02,258
They come from your heart to your brain.

779
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:10,425
And that is when

780
00:55:12,925 --> 00:55:18,634
you absolutely understand what is God,

781
00:55:23,717 --> 00:55:28,550
absolutely you know what is God is.

782
00:55:30,634 --> 00:55:35,008
That is the time when

783
00:55:37,841 --> 00:55:42,091
one receives the real knowledge.

784
00:55:48,634 --> 00:55:51,675
But unless and until these four petals open,

785
00:55:51,966 --> 00:55:53,799
one may fall back,

786
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,883
and that's why some of the Sahaja yogis

787
00:55:57,342 --> 00:56:01,883
who are still meddling with things

788
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:05,634
that they should not do, go down.

789
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,008
And they don't understand what is God is.

790
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,841
But it's not the understanding

791
00:56:15,175 --> 00:56:17,008
- in a way you understand this one little point,

792
00:56:17,425 --> 00:56:21,217
that it comes from your heart into your brain,

793
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:25,175
not from brain to your heart.

794
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,467
It comes

795
00:56:30,841 --> 00:56:34,091
as if the ambrosia of

796
00:56:34,383 --> 00:56:38,634
your bhakti covers your brain, absolutely.

797
00:56:41,258 --> 00:56:42,383
Say for example,

798
00:56:42,634 --> 00:56:45,717
Shankaracharya wrote a beautiful treatise

799
00:56:46,008 --> 00:56:47,342
called as "Viveka Chudamani"

800
00:56:47,634 --> 00:56:50,258
where he described what is God, this, that;

801
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:53,008
and "viveka" means the conscience,

802
00:56:53,383 --> 00:56:57,133
and consciousness and all that he described quite a lot.

803
00:56:58,509 --> 00:57:00,717
But there was one horrible fellow called Sarma

804
00:57:00,966 --> 00:57:04,175
who started arguing with him and he got fed up,

805
00:57:04,509 --> 00:57:05,925
Shankaracharya.

806
00:57:06,217 --> 00:57:08,509
He said, "No use talking to them."

807
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,634
So he just wrote "Saundarya Lahari."

808
00:57:11,966 --> 00:57:14,799
"Saundarya Lahari" is nothing but all the mantras

809
00:57:15,008 --> 00:57:15,841
praising the Mother.

810
00:57:16,175 --> 00:57:18,467
He said, "Why, I know Mother, now let me praise Her.

811
00:57:18,759 --> 00:57:22,342
Nothing doing - what's the use of talking to these people?

812
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,883
Stupid things, how will they understand?"

813
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:29,799
He realized that "These people haven't got that capacity,

814
00:57:30,091 --> 00:57:34,675
that sensitivity to understand what I know."

815
00:57:35,091 --> 00:57:40,425
That's the real knowledge, is to know what is God.

816
00:57:40,841 --> 00:57:43,300
And if that is God,

817
00:57:43,634 --> 00:57:46,841
then how can you suspect anything,

818
00:57:47,175 --> 00:57:50,175
how can you

819
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:53,133
try to analyze anything?

820
00:57:53,425 --> 00:57:57,133
It's God. It's God Almighty,

821
00:57:57,592 --> 00:57:59,841
which knows everything,

822
00:58:00,258 --> 00:58:02,258
which does everything,

823
00:58:02,717 --> 00:58:05,425
which enjoys everything.

824
00:58:06,008 --> 00:58:09,800
That is the one you should say is the gyana,

825
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:11,841
is the knowledge, is the true knowledge,

826
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:13,258
the pure knowledge.

827
00:58:13,592 --> 00:58:15,800
It's not the knowledge of chakras,

828
00:58:16,175 --> 00:58:18,175
not the knowledge of vibrations,

829
00:58:18,634 --> 00:58:20,425
not the knowledge of kundalini,

830
00:58:20,759 --> 00:58:25,175
but the knowledge of God Almighty.

831
00:58:25,675 --> 00:58:29,258
And the knowledge of God Almighty is not mental.

832
00:58:29,592 --> 00:58:30,799
Again I tell you,

833
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:35,550
it starts from your heart and goes to your brain,

834
00:58:36,342 --> 00:58:43,008
something that comes out of your experience of joy

835
00:58:43,425 --> 00:58:44,717
and covers your brain.

836
00:58:44,966 --> 00:58:47,592
So your brain cannot deny it any more.

837
00:58:47,883 --> 00:58:50,800
Like the - sometimes when you have your mother,

838
00:58:51,133 --> 00:58:54,258
little mother, you know the love of your mother.

839
00:58:54,592 --> 00:58:57,799
But you cannot explain, it comes from your heart

840
00:58:58,133 --> 00:58:59,550
and you say, "No, that's my mother,

841
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:02,675
she won't do like that. I know my mother very well."

842
00:59:03,091 --> 00:59:04,799
The knowledge about your mother,

843
00:59:05,133 --> 00:59:07,550
the one who has given you birth;

844
00:59:07,966 --> 00:59:11,425
may not be, mother may not be very good or whatever it is.

845
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:14,133
But knowledge about God,

846
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,717
that He's love, that He's truth,

847
00:59:17,091 --> 00:59:18,841
that He knows everything,

848
00:59:19,217 --> 00:59:24,342
that just become part and parcel of your being, absolutely,

849
00:59:24,675 --> 00:59:29,300
and that's the time we say is the nirvana.

850
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,091
So it's important,

851
00:59:33,425 --> 00:59:36,342
specially for the people of the West,

852
00:59:36,675 --> 00:59:38,799
now open your hearts,

853
00:59:39,091 --> 00:59:43,217
because it starts from the heart, not from your brain.

854
00:59:47,592 --> 00:59:50,091
Do not judge people on vibrations.

855
00:59:50,425 --> 00:59:53,966
Judge yourself, all the time.

856
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:59,425
I had told that Shiva Puja means more explanation,

857
00:59:59,675 --> 01:00:01,717
more understanding, more this thing;

858
01:00:02,008 --> 01:00:07,883
because in other pujas we do all these mantras, this, that,

859
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:14,800
but in this puja is to know the knowledge,

860
01:00:15,258 --> 01:00:18,091
it's God.

861
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:22,550
And to know that you know God itself is so great.

862
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:28,383
Whatever it is - She may be Mahamaya,

863
01:00:28,634 --> 01:00:32,050
She may be anything, but I know Her.

864
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:34,175
It cannot be described in one book,

865
01:00:34,425 --> 01:00:37,091
it cannot be described in hundred books.

866
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,509
It cannot be described in words,

867
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:45,425
but to know that's God - after all, that's God,

868
01:00:45,925 --> 01:00:48,717
God Almighty.

869
01:00:51,008 --> 01:00:53,799
And that gives you

870
01:00:54,091 --> 01:00:57,675
that beautiful surrender,

871
01:00:58,091 --> 01:01:01,883
where you just feel absolutely secured

872
01:01:04,342 --> 01:01:07,342
in that ocean of love.

873
01:01:08,133 --> 01:01:10,800
I wish you all to achieve that state.

874
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,258
May God bless you.
