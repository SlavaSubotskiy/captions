1
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:01,158
Bu gün, içimizde Shiva olarak,

2
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:06,367
ruh olarak yansıyan Sadashiva’ya

3
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,950
ibadet etmek için burada topladık.

4
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:20,283
O kalbimizde aksetti

5
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:28,033
ve gördüğünüz gibi,

6
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:35,783
hayatımızın amacı ruhun bu konumunu elde etmektir.

7
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:52,200
Geçen gün, bu aydınlanmanın,

8
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:59,033
ruhu bilmenin nasıl yapılabildiğine

9
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,741
ve insanların nasıl işkence gördüklerine

10
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,200
 dair bazı kitaplar okuyordum.

11
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:20,117
Her şeyden önce, onlardan şu veya bu şekilde

12
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:28,283
bedenlerini inkâr etmeleri, ayıplamaları, reddetmeleri istenirdi.

13
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:35,450
Şimdi, eğer beden konfor isterse,

14
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:45,242
o zaman onlara önce yatakta değil,

15
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,409
halı üzerinde uyumaya çalışmaları söylenirdi.

16
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:53,325
Sonrasında bu hala yeterli değildir;

17
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:56,825
o zaman da siz halıdan bir paspasa geçmelisiniz

18
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,991
ama bu yine de yeterli değildir.

19
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:03,659
Ondan sonrada belki,

20
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:07,741
Toprak Ana'ya geçersiniz,

21
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:12,617
Toprak Ana üzerinde uyursunuz.

22
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:19,741
Eğer vücut hala iyi değilse,

23
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:24,325
o zamanda taşın üzerinde uyumaya başlarsınız.

24
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:28,575
Ama yine de Himalaya'lar uzaktadır,

25
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:31,783
çünkü Shiva, Kailasha'da yaşıyor.

26
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:36,783
Bu yüzden siz Himalayalara gidip buz üzerinde  uyursunuz.

27
00:04:37,117 --> 00:04:41,617
Minimum gereksinim buydu.

28
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:50,325
Sonra iyi yemeklere düşkün olduğunuzu,

29
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:54,991
görkemli yiyecekler yemek istediğinizi,

30
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:58,242
çok yemek yediğinizi söylediniz,

31
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:02,367
tamam; bu yüzden başlarken sevdiğiniz her şeyi,

32
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,492
hoşlandığınız her şeyi reddedersiniz.

33
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:08,158
Örneğin, İtalyanlar makarna yiyemezler!

34
00:05:13,783 --> 00:05:18,367
O zaman bunu reddedin

35
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:22,534
ama bu yeterli değildir.

36
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:26,242
Bundan sonra siz çok acı olan

37
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,991
 şeyler yemeye başlarsınız.

38
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:32,741
Zen sisteminde olduğu gibi,

39
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:36,783
size yemeniz için yoğunlaştırılmış kinin gibi,

40
00:05:37,117 --> 00:05:41,908
kesinlikle acı - ya da kesinlikle tatlı bir şey verirler.

41
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:45,659
Yani dilinizi teste sokun

42
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:49,950
ama mide hala oradadır.

43
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:52,950
Eğer çok fazla yiyorsanız,

44
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:56,866
bir gün boyunca oruç tutuyorsunuz.

45
00:05:57,242 --> 00:05:59,200
Buda yeterli değildir.

46
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:01,325
Sonra yedi gün boyunca oruç tutun, daha sonra da kırk gün.

47
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:06,075
Yani, bir ayda sadece otuz gün var;

48
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:09,325
kırk gün oruç tutmakla siz zaten bitmişsiniz demektir.

49
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:14,534
İşte Nirvana için, bu şekilde kefaret yapmak zorunda kalırsınız.

50
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,242
Çünkü siz zaten sanki bir nirvana almış gibisiniz

51
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,741
çünkü siz bittiniz ve öldünüz, bakın, sizden geriye hiçbir şey kalmadı,

52
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:23,534
 geriye kemiklerden başka bir şey kalmadı

53
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:27,699
ve o zaman bu kemikler nirvana olurlar.

54
00:06:28,158 --> 00:06:30,033
Nihayetinde bunu ölümtakip eder,

55
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:31,783
yani siz bittiniz, nirvana var,

56
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:34,367
 buna şüphe yok.

57
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:38,659
O zaman siz bir evde yaşamıyorsunuz

58
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:40,741
çünkü ev konfordur.

59
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:44,450
Karınızı bırakın, çocuklarınızı bırakın, herkesten vazgeçin.

60
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:49,866
Şimdi sadece belinize doladığınız

61
00:06:51,117 --> 00:06:53,575
 bir bez gibi bir şey giyin

62
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:03,617
ve gidip insanlardan sadaka isteyin.

63
00:07:09,783 --> 00:07:13,617
Bu kıyafetlerle de hala sorun vardır,

64
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:16,367
çünkü siz elbisenize bağımlısınız.

65
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:19,991
Bu yüzden sizi görecek kimsenin olmadığı Himalayalara gidersiniz,

66
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:21,492
elbiselerinizi çıkartır

67
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:25,908
ve o soğukta tamamen titrersiniz.

68
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:28,033
O zaman nirvananızı alacaksınızdır.

69
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:31,200
Bu şekilde nirvanaya ulaşırsınız.

70
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:37,575
Tüm bu şartlar en başta

71
00:07:40,741 --> 00:07:46,117
bedeninizin taleplerini yok edecek şekilde oluşturulmuştur.

72
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,117
Bedeninize "Hayır, sen hiçbir şey yapmazsın.

73
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:55,367
Nirvananı halletsen iyi olur", dersiniz.

74
00:07:56,534 --> 00:08:01,450
İkinci şey ise, sizi duyulara,

75
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:06,783
neşeye götüren zihninizi yok etmekti.

76
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:14,908
Varsayalım ki, bir şeye sahip olmak istiyorsunuz,

77
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:20,866
bir şeyi çok istiyorsunuz,

78
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:25,450
bu yüzden siz onu inkâr edin, inkâr edin.

79
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:27,991
Zihninizin söylediği her şeye,

80
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:31,075
sadece "Hayır, hayır, hayır" deyin.

81
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:34,325
Sanskritçe olan shloka şöyledir,

82
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,117
"Yat neti neti vachane, nigamo vacha"

83
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,492
yani siz "neti, neti" demeye devam edersiniz:

84
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:46,700
"Hayır, bu değil, bu değil, bu değil, bu değil."

85
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:50,242
Ve sonrasında – siz üzerinde tartışabilirsiniz,

86
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:53,409
sadece tartışırsınız – evet, nirvana.

87
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:59,200
Before that you are not even worthy of discussion of nirvana.

88
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:02,825
When I read this book I said,

89
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,409
"Baba, I give up. It's too much."

90
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,617
But in Sahaja Yoga

91
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,741
is the other way round,

92
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:19,866
like building first the pinnacle of the building,

93
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,866
and then the foundation.

94
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:28,075
Opening your Sahasrara was the first thing was achieved.

95
00:09:28,825 --> 00:09:31,950
And then in the light of Sahasrara

96
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:35,700
you have to watch yourself and see for yourself.

97
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:41,659
Gradually the introspection was a better thing,

98
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:45,409
through vibrations

99
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:50,075
is to see why:

100
00:09:50,325 --> 00:09:52,534
why I want this?

101
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:55,825
Why my attention goes to my comfort?

102
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:58,699
Why my attention goes to food,

103
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:02,200
why to my family, why to my children,

104
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:05,825
when I have to achieve the highest?

105
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:09,075
So you start introspecting yourself.

106
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,659
Then you know on your vibrations also

107
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,659
there's something wrong with you.

108
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:19,325
Then you don't try to see others,

109
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:22,699
what's wrong with others, you start seeing yourself;

110
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:28,699
because it's your own ascent

111
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:32,075
you have to achieve.

112
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:37,741
But in the olden times,

113
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:43,741
all these things were done individually.

114
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:48,242
Like a one person who starts

115
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:51,783
the path of nirvana,

116
00:10:55,659 --> 00:11:00,700
he used to go into ekant, means into lonely places,

117
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:03,450
stay away from people, avoid them,

118
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:05,200
have nothing to do,

119
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:09,450
and achieve this ascent,

120
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:13,741
Self-realization, only for himself.

121
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,534
It was not for others.

122
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:22,741
Then this gentleman became absolutely exclusive.

123
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:24,741
He wouldn't talk to anyone,

124
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:27,075
he wouldn't meet anybody

125
00:11:27,575 --> 00:11:28,908
and he would sit somewhere

126
00:11:29,283 --> 00:11:33,783
on top of a remote mountain.

127
00:11:35,617 --> 00:11:37,617
Anybody who tried to meet him

128
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:41,117
he would throw stones or say all kinds of horrible things,

129
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,117
and never meet that person.

130
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,158
But Sahaja Yoga is not the same thing.

131
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,783
Sahaja Yoga is the ascent of the whole.

132
00:12:00,117 --> 00:12:03,033
This kind of singular achievements

133
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:06,033
did not lead people anywhere.

134
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,908
Saints of course tried to talk to people,

135
00:12:11,283 --> 00:12:13,700
tell them about Self-realization, about God,

136
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:17,908
about righteousness, about value system;

137
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:23,450
but they too were regarded as something strange,

138
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:27,617
and were tortured and troubled.

139
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:35,575
So on the level of an individual ascent,

140
00:12:36,158 --> 00:12:38,283
they couldn't do anything for others

141
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:41,367
except for talking about it, telling about it,

142
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:46,033
till Sahaja Yoga came.

143
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:50,367
Even the talking about it was prohibited.

144
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:56,033
Till the twelfth century in India

145
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,908
nobody talked about it to the public.

146
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:03,367
It was all in Sanskrit,

147
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,492
very difficult Sanskrit books

148
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:09,783
which were only available to few aspirants.

149
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:13,117
Was explained to very, very few even,

150
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:18,242
amounting to few numbers of people.

151
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:25,492
But giving realization was denied.

152
00:13:26,783 --> 00:13:30,575
So only one master had one disciple,

153
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,158
and all was the individual ascent,

154
00:13:34,492 --> 00:13:36,283
individual working out.

155
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:38,908
Such a disciple was taken away from others

156
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:41,450
and was kept in secret,

157
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:43,741
worked it out on him;

158
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:48,492
and just he may sing, he may write poems,

159
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:51,492
he may talk about it, he might say what his joy is,

160
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:55,699
but he had no right to give realization to anyone,

161
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:58,741
neither he knew how to give realization.

162
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:04,033
So now you see how far you have gone.

163
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:07,033
You've got your realization

164
00:14:07,575 --> 00:14:10,242
without giving up much.

165
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:15,492
You can work on a much wider scale,

166
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:18,367
you can give realizations to other.

167
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:22,242
You know about all the subtle knowledge

168
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:26,450
about Sahaja Yoga.

169
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:31,117
But today I'm going to tell you something more

170
00:14:31,534 --> 00:14:33,825
which we have to know.

171
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,242
It's very important to know,

172
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:43,409
because as was described by people

173
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:49,409
that they practice Sahaja Yoga as they go to church,

174
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,534
but it's not from their heart.

175
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,659
And heart is the abode of the spirit

176
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:06,825
- is the Shiva within us.

177
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,450
So we have to know more about heart,

178
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:15,825
and that is very important.

179
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,158
You know about these three nadis we have:

180
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:22,409
Ida, Pingala, Sushumna;

181
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:26,492
but in the heart there are four nadis.

182
00:15:30,325 --> 00:15:34,659
And the one nadi goes to Mooladhara,

183
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:41,908
and if you cross the limits of Mooladhara it goes to hell.

184
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:46,575
That's why they say that Shiva is a destroyer.

185
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:50,741
Actually you ask for your destruction.

186
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:57,699
And when you ask for your destruction, you have it.

187
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:06,242
Even if it destroys everything, as I was telling,

188
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:10,991
it's like when a fruit has to come,

189
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:14,991
the petals look as if they're destroyed

190
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:17,991
- as I have destroyed, I would say, many of your things:

191
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:20,950
you can call it like your conditionings,

192
00:16:21,242 --> 00:16:23,534
your ego, your racialism, your fanaticism.

193
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,991
All this has been destroyed in Sahaja Yoga.

194
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,075
This has to be destroyed

195
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:33,699
for the beauty to come out.

196
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:40,991
So when your maryadas

197
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,075
you cross beyond certain point,

198
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,158
you go to your destruction.

199
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,991
In four directions there are destructions built,

200
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,325
as there are four nadis.

201
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,617
So now, what is to be done?

202
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:09,659
How are we to stop this destruction of the,

203
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:13,409
through the first nadi, going to hell?

204
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:19,409
One of the qualities of Shiva is that He's innocence.

205
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:23,409
He's extremely innocent. He's innocent like a child.

206
00:17:23,741 --> 00:17:26,825
He is innocence personified.

207
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:33,033
So

208
00:17:34,783 --> 00:17:41,367
we have to put our carnal desires,

209
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,325
dissolve them,

210
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:51,866
dissolve them into the innocence,

211
00:17:52,242 --> 00:17:55,492
the ocean of innocence.

212
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,783
You have to dissolve it in the ocean of innocence.

213
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:10,783
Innocence is something to be appreciated,

214
00:18:11,117 --> 00:18:15,325
to be understood, to be enjoyed.

215
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:19,450
Like you see animals, they're innocent;

216
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,200
you see children, they're innocent;

217
00:18:25,991 --> 00:18:28,200
flowers, they're innocent.

218
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:33,492
Divert your attention

219
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:38,325
to all these things.

220
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,158
You see, on walking on the street,

221
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:49,659
what is there to see best

222
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:53,741
is all at three feet height.

223
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,659
You see at three feet height all the flowers,

224
00:18:58,991 --> 00:19:00,991
all the beautiful grass,

225
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:05,699
all the children who are about three feet are the best.

226
00:19:06,699 --> 00:19:10,325
You need not see people who are above that.

227
00:19:13,242 --> 00:19:16,950
Just see on three feet level.

228
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,450
You can see the legs of somebody, that's all right.

229
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:30,325
But you don't see the eyes of a person

230
00:19:30,699 --> 00:19:33,575
who are not innocent.

231
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:38,033
So dissolve this desire

232
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:42,200
into innocence.

233
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:46,825
And this Mooladhara which is innocent

234
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,409
is not dead, finished, but is innocent,

235
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:55,866
it is righteous,

236
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:58,950
it is Shri Ganesha's qualities,

237
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,283
it's pure.

238
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:05,825
So even if you are in this world,

239
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:08,492
even if you are living like a human being,

240
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:11,283
even if you have children,

241
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:15,158
still you are innocent.

242
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:22,283
Like once the wives of Shri Krishna

243
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:25,617
- He had sixteen thousand wives to begin with,

244
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,908
and the five more.

245
00:20:28,325 --> 00:20:30,033
The sixteen thousand were His powers,

246
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:33,200
and five were the elements.

247
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:41,659
They were wanting to go to pray to some big well-known,

248
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:48,200
I should say, saint had come, a maharshi had come.

249
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:52,117
So they wanted to go and see him and pay respects.

250
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:56,117
So they asked Shri Krishna's permission,

251
00:20:56,492 --> 00:21:00,699
but when they went they found the river was all in spate,

252
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,200
so flooded they could not cross over.

253
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,534
They came back, they said,

254
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:12,783
"How can we cross over this river? It's all in spate."

255
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,033
So this Krishna said,

256
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,158
"All right, you just go and say,

257
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:21,908
РІР‚В˜If Shri Krishna is Yogeshwara,

258
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:27,741
and if He is absolutely innocent about sex,

259
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,492
you go down.'"

260
00:21:34,617 --> 00:21:36,325
They said, "How can we? We are so many wives.

261
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,908
What is He talking about?"

262
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:43,075
So they went down and said this to the river,

263
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:46,200
and the river went down, and they were surprised that

264
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:50,825
"this husband of ours is saying all these things."

265
00:21:54,783 --> 00:21:59,659
They went across and worshipped that rishi

266
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:04,659
and they were coming back, again the river was in floods.

267
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,367
So they went back to the rishi, said,

268
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:11,075
"Now how are we to cross over because it's in floods?"

269
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:12,659
He said, "How did you come?"

270
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:15,825
So they told the story of Shri Krishna.

271
00:22:16,492 --> 00:22:19,367
Now they had fed this rishi with food and fruits

272
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:22,492
and he had eaten such a lot.

273
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,283
"All right, you go and tell this river that

274
00:22:26,617 --> 00:22:29,699
this rishi has not eaten at all anything."

275
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:32,242
They said, "How can it be? Just now you ate before us."

276
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:34,117
He said, "Just go and see."

277
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:40,075
They went back and told this to the river.

278
00:22:41,991 --> 00:22:45,200
The river again went down.

279
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,450
So to live in this world,

280
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:53,450
to be a wife or to be a husband,

281
00:22:53,783 --> 00:22:58,908
to be married, whatever it is,

282
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:03,534
you can be innocent,

283
00:23:04,117 --> 00:23:07,367
absolutely innocent about it.

284
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:11,075
That's the sign of your purity.

285
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:19,367
The second nadi, the second channel

286
00:23:19,783 --> 00:23:23,242
that can take you to destruction is desire.

287
00:23:24,325 --> 00:23:26,866
That's why Buddha has said that desirelessness

288
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:30,991
is the only way that people do not get old,

289
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:33,699
nor sick,

290
00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:37,575
nor worried.

291
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:44,866
Now this desire that we have,

292
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:47,659
"I want this,"

293
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:51,200
in the West is much more than anywhere else

294
00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:53,699
because the entrepreneurs are every day

295
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:56,242
producing new things.

296
00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:00,325
Say for example a hairdress,

297
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:03,242
so the women want to buy this wig or that wig,

298
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:06,741
"It's my desire, I must have this wig to put on my head."

299
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,117
The another one says, "All right, I must have this one."

300
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:19,200
And the desire, for men, is "Oh, if he is having

301
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:23,075
a Rolls Royce, why shouldn't I have one?"

302
00:24:25,866 --> 00:24:29,325
They cannot enjoy somebody else's Rolls Royce.

303
00:24:31,242 --> 00:24:36,409
It should be your own, that "I should have the possession."

304
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:42,325
Desires can be of any kind, not only material.

305
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:47,908
The desires could be also

306
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,575
quite mental,

307
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:55,450
"I must possess this woman,

308
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:58,783
I must possess this child."

309
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:04,117
All kinds of possessions that work into you as desires.

310
00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:08,908
But I wouldn't say it is because of attachment.

311
00:25:10,908 --> 00:25:15,367
It's not attachment, but it is just to have more.

312
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:28,575
Go on adding up things, getting things

313
00:25:32,242 --> 00:25:36,367
- still one doesn't feel happy and satisfied.

314
00:25:38,617 --> 00:25:40,908
What is the reason

315
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:46,534
for this kind of a desire is that it's not pure desire.

316
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:50,033
It's an impure desire.

317
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,242
It's an impure desire,

318
00:25:52,492 --> 00:25:54,700
and when such a desire starts working

319
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:57,033
you can go any far,

320
00:25:57,409 --> 00:25:59,825
like Saddam Hussein, like Hitler,

321
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:01,659
like anything is nothing

322
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,492
but absolutely desire beyond

323
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:11,409
any limitations.

324
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:14,908
You want to dominate others

325
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,283
is also another desire.

326
00:26:21,825 --> 00:26:23,950
All these desires

327
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:28,825
lead you ultimately to a destruction,

328
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:33,242
because there's no joy,

329
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,783
there's no happiness.

330
00:26:37,825 --> 00:26:43,950
For example, now I want to have a sari,

331
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:50,075
so I want to buy a sari.

332
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,950
All my attention will be how will I get that sari,

333
00:26:54,283 --> 00:26:56,409
I must get that sari, this thing, that thing.

334
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,492
The attention becomes polluted,

335
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:06,075
disturbed, for a nonsensical thing like a sari.

336
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:10,492
The attention which has to enjoy,

337
00:27:11,825 --> 00:27:15,158
which has to enjoy the spirit,

338
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:19,367
which has to nourish the spirit,

339
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:25,659
becomes disturbed because of desires.

340
00:27:27,534 --> 00:27:30,700
In the first place the attention

341
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:34,908
is disturbed because we are not innocent.

342
00:27:36,158 --> 00:27:40,033
In the second place the attention

343
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,242
gets into turmoil because we have desire.

344
00:27:50,075 --> 00:27:55,283
So what should we do as far as the desire is concerned?

345
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:02,033
The desire for beautiful things

346
00:28:04,158 --> 00:28:08,075
- we can shift our desire,

347
00:28:08,908 --> 00:28:11,700
material desire into aesthetics,

348
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:16,659
and have one thing but which is really aesthetically rich;

349
00:28:18,492 --> 00:28:21,367
because that's the quality of Shiva,

350
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:25,367
that He gives aesthetics to everything.

351
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,950
Now supposing this looks very plain,

352
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:31,617
simple and one may say that mechanical.

353
00:28:32,158 --> 00:28:34,367
But if it was Shiva's job

354
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:37,950
He would have done something beautiful about it.

355
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:44,367
So the quality of Shiva is that He beautifies everything

356
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:48,617
that is created by Brahmadeva,

357
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,617
evolved by Vishnu.

358
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,242
He's the one who does

359
00:28:56,575 --> 00:28:59,617
the subtle work of creating aesthetics.

360
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:02,117
You've seen My photographs many a times

361
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,659
with so many lights, this, that - is all His job.

362
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:08,367
He's doing it.

363
00:29:08,699 --> 00:29:11,367
He throws lights in such a manner,

364
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,242
He works out in such a manner.

365
00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:17,409
Just He wants to convince you about Me.

366
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,242
It's His job.

367
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:23,242
So His job is to create aesthetics:

368
00:29:25,117 --> 00:29:27,741
aesthetics of behavior,

369
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:32,617
aesthetics of poetry.

370
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:39,866
Everything that is created is made beautiful,

371
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:45,117
is joy-giving, by Shiva - that's His quality.

372
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:49,866
So whatever you desire,

373
00:29:50,158 --> 00:29:53,575
if you start working it out,

374
00:29:55,908 --> 00:30:01,908
desiring for something aesthetically handmade, nice thing,

375
00:30:06,325 --> 00:30:08,492
gradually you'll find

376
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:11,242
you'll end up with vibrations,

377
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:15,200
because all beautiful things have vibrations.

378
00:30:17,492 --> 00:30:19,033
And to have the vibrations

379
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:22,492
you'll have to go to pure desire.

380
00:30:24,117 --> 00:30:26,908
So this desire which is madness,

381
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,575
which makes you mad,

382
00:30:29,991 --> 00:30:35,575
which is so much dull and boring

383
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:41,450
becomes pure desire, because you have to dissolve

384
00:30:41,825 --> 00:30:43,991
all your desires into vibration.

385
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:48,200
You start desiring nothing but vibrations after some time.

386
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:53,409
You'll not buy anything which has no vibrations.

387
00:30:53,866 --> 00:30:56,991
You'll not talk to a person who has no vibrations.

388
00:30:57,741 --> 00:31:01,325
If somebody has [no] vibrations you'll just run away.

389
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:10,617
I've seen people running away

390
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,700
from some people

391
00:31:12,991 --> 00:31:17,158
as if some monkey is after them.

392
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,575
When I look around,

393
00:31:18,866 --> 00:31:20,450
I find there are people who are drunkard,

394
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,950
or somebody coming or something.

395
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:26,575
They might have been drunkard themselves once upon a time,

396
00:31:27,075 --> 00:31:28,283
but now they run away,

397
00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:32,659
"No, no, no, no. Not so now. Now no, no more."

398
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:37,158
We had three, four hippies to begin

399
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:39,617
with who came with Me to India.

400
00:31:39,866 --> 00:31:41,741
They're normal like you, they were become,

401
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:43,699
you see, Sahaja yogis.

402
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:47,908
And four, five hippies came to My program,

403
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:50,200
it was in Rahuri, I think.

404
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:54,866
They got a fright of their life, "Oh no, oh, God!"

405
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:56,575
I said, "What's the matter with you?

406
00:31:56,783 --> 00:31:58,492
Why are you so frightened?"

407
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,741
So I turned round to see these hippies,

408
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:03,991
and by the time I'd turned round they were out.

409
00:32:05,117 --> 00:32:07,617
They were no more there.

410
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:14,325
So then what happens, all desire ends up into chaitanya,

411
00:32:14,908 --> 00:32:17,033
into vibrations.

412
00:32:17,325 --> 00:32:18,409
And if it does not,

413
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,866
then you must know there's something still missing.

414
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,158
But if you do not do this,

415
00:32:25,325 --> 00:32:28,659
then you end up into your destruction.

416
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:33,492
So to say that He's a destroyer

417
00:32:33,825 --> 00:32:38,200
is a very one-sided statement.

418
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:42,700
He has both the powers.

419
00:32:43,158 --> 00:32:46,908
He has the power to give you vibrations.

420
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:50,492
He gives you vibrations.

421
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,825
The Goddess is the power, Shakti,

422
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,617
but He makes the vibrations.

423
00:33:01,825 --> 00:33:04,741
It's like these are the fingers, all right,

424
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:09,741
but if they tickle you then it's Shiva.

425
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,617
The fingers are that of the Goddess, all right,

426
00:33:15,866 --> 00:33:19,700
but if it tickles, you know, gives you joy,

427
00:33:20,075 --> 00:33:24,659
happiness, it's Shiva, is the bhakti.

428
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,700
The joy of bhakti comes from Shiva.

429
00:33:31,825 --> 00:33:34,492
Today only I was explaining

430
00:33:34,825 --> 00:33:37,950
how one lady who was a Devi bhakt

431
00:33:38,492 --> 00:33:41,117
and has done so much study of bhakti

432
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,450
and all that and knew so much,

433
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,908
just merged into Me.

434
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,825
I just couldn't understand her how, what she has done,

435
00:33:51,325 --> 00:33:52,950
because normally people don't do.

436
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,075
When they are reading about Devi they think,

437
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:56,866
"All right, this is Devi, this is Mataji."

438
00:33:57,117 --> 00:33:58,991
You see, it's separate things.

439
00:33:59,242 --> 00:34:02,450
They don't know they are reading about Devi.

440
00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:06,325
So she said, "Mother, I just identified.

441
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:09,575
It's written that how You are gentle,

442
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,575
the Goddess is gentle, how She touches me,

443
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,659
how She looks after me,

444
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,325
how Her attention is on me."

445
00:34:17,741 --> 00:34:21,450
Like there's a sentence "kataksha, kataksha, nirikshana:

446
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:24,075
every glance is an inspection."

447
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,325
But "inspection" not a very good word,

448
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:30,200
but "nirikshana" means inspection, divine inspection.

449
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:35,200
"So all the time I feel that it's You, You,

450
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:38,950
You are all the time - when I listen to music

451
00:34:39,283 --> 00:34:42,367
I feel now, see, She is looking at me,

452
00:34:42,783 --> 00:34:46,283
She is feeling me, She is nourishing me.

453
00:34:46,825 --> 00:34:50,075
All the time I feel Your love."

454
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:54,409
That's how the bhakti comes in.

455
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:56,158
So if you have vibrations

456
00:34:56,534 --> 00:35:00,741
that doesn't mean that they are something dry, you see?

457
00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:04,075
No,

458
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:08,409
it means the joy of bhakti.

459
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:14,659
Bhakti is, you can call it adoration, this, that.

460
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:19,991
It's the ocean of love that is God.

461
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:22,699
You just get drenched into it.

462
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:25,450
There's no words to it.

463
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:31,659
And that is what when you feel,

464
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:34,242
you must know that

465
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:38,950
you have taken the spirit

466
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:44,534
as a real connection

467
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,200
between you and your Mother,

468
00:35:50,325 --> 00:35:52,866
or your Father.

469
00:35:54,825 --> 00:36:00,325
There's no differentiation.

470
00:36:02,741 --> 00:36:06,075
You are one

471
00:36:06,325 --> 00:36:09,075
in that ocean, drenched in the ocean.

472
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,117
You are the drop, you are the ocean.

473
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:15,699
You are one in that bhakti.

474
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:20,699
And that bhakti cannot be mechanical,

475
00:36:23,991 --> 00:36:26,741
because not man-made.

476
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:34,699
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga

477
00:36:35,991 --> 00:36:39,991
you must know that it's not dry vibrations only,

478
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:43,325
but is the bhakti.

479
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:46,617
That is the joy

480
00:36:47,242 --> 00:36:49,242
of Shiva's quality,

481
00:36:49,617 --> 00:36:53,033
the quality of joy that He adds

482
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,575
to our life.

483
00:36:57,242 --> 00:37:01,450
Everything seems to be surrounded, resounding.

484
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,783
Same thing the joy,

485
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:06,783
that "I'm loved so much by God,

486
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,242
that God loves me,

487
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:12,492
that I have a meaning in life."

488
00:37:13,991 --> 00:37:18,991
Then the ego drops out first of all,

489
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:26,033
and also the conditionings drop out.

490
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:32,991
Now the third nadi:

491
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,700
third nadi

492
00:37:42,242 --> 00:37:46,158
is the nadi by which we feel attached,

493
00:37:48,158 --> 00:37:50,158
attached to someone.

494
00:37:50,492 --> 00:37:54,825
Like this is my child, this is my husband,

495
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:57,534
this is my family,

496
00:37:57,825 --> 00:38:00,075
this is my wife,

497
00:38:00,783 --> 00:38:04,242
this is my father, this is my mother.

498
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,283
In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga of everyone,

499
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:13,783
when they are just the beginners,

500
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:18,700
so they talk about their whole family,

501
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,409
"My father is like this,

502
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,659
my mother is sick, my mother's sister's brother's

503
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:29,908
this, that's real, this thing, is not well."

504
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:35,283
As if, you see, we all have taken a contract.

505
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:40,158
What should I do?

506
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:46,117
Like today somebody said that "You see,

507
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,450
they lost their first child.

508
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:51,908
First child they lost,

509
00:38:52,741 --> 00:38:55,617
because the child was sleeping in another room."

510
00:38:55,825 --> 00:38:59,659
I said, "Small children should sleep with mother,

511
00:38:59,908 --> 00:39:01,825
and mother must look after the children."

512
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:03,367
It's simple thing - I mean,

513
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:06,200
in India no mother would accept such a situation.

514
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:08,033
She'll throw away the husband,

515
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:11,575
say, "What's this? I have to look after the child."

516
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:16,617
So I said, "Tell them that they should sleep with the child."

517
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:19,367
But they don't believe in it.

518
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:21,783
So all right - what can we do?

519
00:39:22,033 --> 00:39:24,908
Have we taken their contract that

520
00:39:25,242 --> 00:39:27,158
we should look after their children,

521
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:30,783
even when they don't want to listen to us?

522
00:39:31,617 --> 00:39:37,699
So the idea is, all the time in the beginning is that

523
00:39:37,991 --> 00:39:41,991
"Oh Mother, I've been doing Sahaja Yoga for one month,

524
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:47,117
but so far my financial condition has not improved."

525
00:39:48,117 --> 00:39:51,033
As if they're going to sue Me for that,

526
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:55,908
as if I've let them down.

527
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:00,575
But they don't want to see that

528
00:40:00,783 --> 00:40:02,991
you have just now come to Sahaja Yoga,

529
00:40:03,325 --> 00:40:05,617
or even if you have been in Sahaja Yoga for so many years,

530
00:40:05,866 --> 00:40:08,699
you have not been a Sahaja yogi.

531
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:11,575
Something missing, you don't deserve.

532
00:40:11,866 --> 00:40:14,866
Something wrong with you, not with Sahaja Yoga.

533
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:18,866
But they feel that Sahaja Yoga

534
00:40:19,325 --> 00:40:23,450
is something which has got the contract.

535
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,200
Immediately they'll inform you,

536
00:40:25,492 --> 00:40:26,534
"Now somebody is sick there,

537
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:28,617
somebody's somebody's somebody's somebody.

538
00:40:28,908 --> 00:40:33,825
Send five Sahaja yogis." For what?

539
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,950
These attachments start working within us.

540
00:40:41,783 --> 00:40:44,450
Now some people I've seen

541
00:40:45,325 --> 00:40:48,783
are very attached to their children

542
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:55,741
and they go on pampering, "Oh, my child, my child."

543
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:57,741
And suddenly they discover

544
00:40:57,991 --> 00:41:01,534
the child is now is a devil's child.

545
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,741
The child starts answering back,

546
00:41:05,075 --> 00:41:07,741
saying all kinds of things, beating the parents,

547
00:41:08,075 --> 00:41:11,158
misbehaving, and then they suddenly discover

548
00:41:11,617 --> 00:41:14,700
that "this is the child whom I have been looking after,

549
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,033
giving so much love."

550
00:41:16,325 --> 00:41:17,950
And they feel even worse,

551
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:21,700
because "I have done so much for my wife,

552
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:23,200
and she is treating me like this."

553
00:41:23,534 --> 00:41:25,741
"I've done so much for my husband,

554
00:41:26,075 --> 00:41:27,283
and he is treating me like this."

555
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:29,158
Why do you do so much?

556
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:30,866
There's no need.

557
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,283
And if you are doing it, you just do it and you forget it.

558
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:37,700
I never feel that way.

559
00:41:38,075 --> 00:41:40,659
I know of Sahaja yogis for whom I have worked very hard,

560
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,617
and they have gone down.

561
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,158
Only thing if I feel anything,

562
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,200
only God knows where will they jump?

563
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:48,033
Where will they be in hell?

564
00:41:48,283 --> 00:41:51,033
What will happen to them? That's the only concern.

565
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,033
Not the concern what has happened,

566
00:41:53,283 --> 00:41:55,699
because nothing can \happen to Me.

567
00:41:58,492 --> 00:42:00,534
But if they have been sinful

568
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:05,409
I just get worried about their future,

569
00:42:05,783 --> 00:42:08,825
about their lives. That's different.

570
00:42:09,283 --> 00:42:11,825
So this kind of attachment that is we call in Sanskrit is

571
00:42:12,158 --> 00:42:14,700
"mamatva" - "this is mine, that's my child,

572
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,158
my this thing, my that."

573
00:42:20,825 --> 00:42:24,700
Who are your relations are Sahaja yogis - remember this.

574
00:42:25,033 --> 00:42:26,783
It's a sentence you must remember,

575
00:42:27,117 --> 00:42:30,158
"My relations are Sahaja yogis only.

576
00:42:30,534 --> 00:42:34,908
And anybody who plays against Sahaja yogis,

577
00:42:35,242 --> 00:42:38,117
troubles Sahaja yogis - that person could be my own wife,

578
00:42:38,409 --> 00:42:41,950
could be my own child - is not mine."

579
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:46,825
Because I'll not allow such a thing to happen.

580
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:50,700
This relationship is all right till

581
00:42:51,158 --> 00:42:55,158
Sahaja yogis are one with each other.

582
00:42:55,492 --> 00:43:00,158
As soon as somebody tries to harm any other Sahaja yogi,

583
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:02,699
then I'm not with that person.

584
00:43:02,908 --> 00:43:04,409
I've seen there are many like that,

585
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,242
but very good Sahaja yogis.

586
00:43:06,575 --> 00:43:07,950
They'll never side with their wives,

587
00:43:08,242 --> 00:43:10,283
never side with their children,

588
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,908
because they know if you are siding with them

589
00:43:14,242 --> 00:43:19,283
you are making them sinful, you're destroying them.

590
00:43:19,783 --> 00:43:21,367
They're worried about their ascent

591
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,700
so they'll never allow, never allow anybody,

592
00:43:25,117 --> 00:43:28,699
a relation of theirs to trouble others.

593
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:32,575
I have seen some children

594
00:43:33,158 --> 00:43:35,575
who are extremely naughty,

595
00:43:35,825 --> 00:43:38,700
they're very troublesome, very violent,

596
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,700
and the parents just saying, "Mother, put them right.

597
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:45,033
We leave it to You." They are to be put right.

598
00:43:45,367 --> 00:43:46,409
But others will say,

599
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:49,158
"Oh, no, no, no, no; you see my child,

600
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:52,908
he cannot do such a thing, you know."

601
00:43:55,492 --> 00:44:00,575
So one has to understand the discrimination part of it,

602
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:04,575
that "Why am I attached?"

603
00:44:05,908 --> 00:44:07,699
I've given this simile many a times,

604
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,783
like the sap of the tree rises,

605
00:44:10,117 --> 00:44:13,575
goes to various places of the trees, various areas,

606
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:17,117
looks after the bark, looks after the branch,

607
00:44:17,409 --> 00:44:19,283
looks after the leaves,

608
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:21,325
flowers and fruits, and comes back,

609
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,741
or it gets evaporated. It doesn't get attached.

610
00:44:25,492 --> 00:44:27,741
If it gets involved into one of them

611
00:44:28,075 --> 00:44:29,325
the whole tree will die,

612
00:44:29,659 --> 00:44:32,659
and that part which

613
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:37,866
is so close to the sap will also die.

614
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:41,492
But sap has much more sense than we have.

615
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:48,117
To them, husband's so important

616
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:51,575
- I mean so many problems of husbands, wives, this, that.

617
00:44:51,866 --> 00:44:54,991
"My God," I sometimes think, "What is this?"

618
00:44:55,283 --> 00:44:57,991
That's why they used to say, "Take a sanyas"

619
00:44:58,283 --> 00:44:59,908
- so nobody can talk about wife,

620
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:01,492
children, nothing.

621
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,700
You have to be a sanyasi, first of all be a sanyasi.

622
00:45:06,117 --> 00:45:07,409
So no headache to the guru.

623
00:45:07,783 --> 00:45:09,158
As soon as you start talking

624
00:45:09,492 --> 00:45:12,117
about any one relation of yours, the guru would say,

625
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:16,117
"All right, you get out. Nothing doing. No good."

626
00:45:18,534 --> 00:45:21,659
But in Sahaja Yoga -

627
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:25,950
Sahaja Yoga has much deeper

628
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,158
work to do.

629
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:30,325
It has to penetrate into the society,

630
00:45:30,617 --> 00:45:32,617
into the political life, into economic life.

631
00:45:32,741 --> 00:45:34,699
You have to emancipate the whole world.

632
00:45:34,991 --> 00:45:37,242
Try to understand your responsibility.

633
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,659
You are not only here for one ascetic ascent, no.

634
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:49,158
How much wisdom you must have,

635
00:45:49,617 --> 00:45:51,409
how much love you must have,

636
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,908
and how much discrimination you must have,

637
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,866
to understand that you are chosen

638
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,200
for the emancipation of the whole world.

639
00:46:04,075 --> 00:46:07,825
So now this so-called limited love,

640
00:46:08,325 --> 00:46:11,492
what is the solution which takes you to destruction

641
00:46:11,825 --> 00:46:14,950
is the unlimited love.

642
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,409
Because Shiva is nothing but love, He's love.

643
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:30,283
Love is that corrects, that nourishes,

644
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:35,200
that wants your benevolence.

645
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,409
That's what Shiva is.

646
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,741
It wants your benevolence.

647
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,825
It looks after your benevolence.

648
00:46:47,492 --> 00:46:51,534
So when

649
00:46:52,617 --> 00:46:57,659
you are looking after the benevolence of others with love,

650
00:47:00,534 --> 00:47:04,033
then the whole life changes,

651
00:47:06,283 --> 00:47:09,200
the whole pattern changes,

652
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:12,158
and you really enjoy it because

653
00:47:12,534 --> 00:47:14,700
you become one with so many,

654
00:47:15,075 --> 00:47:17,866
concerned with so many families, so many things,

655
00:47:18,283 --> 00:47:22,575
so many problems of others,

656
00:47:23,033 --> 00:47:25,699
and you just feel you are one with so many.

657
00:47:26,033 --> 00:47:29,492
Now see, we are so many Sahaja yogis here today.

658
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,575
First time when I came to Italy,

659
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:35,409
I must tell you,

660
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:39,033
I came with Christine - no,

661
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:42,908
what's the name of Gregoire's wife? Catherine.

662
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:46,367
And she was the only one who knew Italian.

663
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:48,575
And we had told some newspaper

664
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:52,117
to reserve some sort of a hall and advertise for us.

665
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:53,908
Nothing was done.

666
00:47:54,242 --> 00:47:57,117
So when we came we couldn't find anyone.

667
00:47:57,492 --> 00:48:00,699
So I went round with her to put the posters,

668
00:48:01,033 --> 00:48:03,741
but still nobody came.

669
00:48:04,325 --> 00:48:06,617
And today we are so many.

670
00:48:06,991 --> 00:48:11,325
But we must know that we are bound to each other by love,

671
00:48:14,575 --> 00:48:20,033
and the love that is for our benevolence, for our ascent.

672
00:48:22,117 --> 00:48:26,325
And then you just start enjoying everyone.

673
00:48:27,492 --> 00:48:29,783
And then you don't think what race you are,

674
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,033
what country you are, what this thing you are,

675
00:48:32,283 --> 00:48:34,367
nothing - a Sahaja yogi, finished!

676
00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:38,283
So you become a universal being.

677
00:48:39,492 --> 00:48:42,242
And this attitude has to be achieved.

678
00:48:42,699 --> 00:48:44,825
When I hear that some Indian girls

679
00:48:45,242 --> 00:48:49,158
are tortured and troubled, I think, "How can they do it?"

680
00:48:49,617 --> 00:48:53,700
Or somebody who has a black skin, they are tortured;

681
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,866
or some Indians are treating somebody

682
00:48:57,283 --> 00:48:59,409
because they are of low caste.

683
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:01,534
It's not possible,

684
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:04,741
because they are all part and parcel of one body.

685
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:09,991
They're all brothers and sisters, born of the same Mother.

686
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,866
But this is only possible

687
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:17,158
when you dissolve that limited relationship of yours

688
00:49:17,534 --> 00:49:20,325
into this great unlimited ocean of love;

689
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,700
then only it is possible.

690
00:49:23,158 --> 00:49:25,950
And if it is not there, do not try to justify

691
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:28,700
- just watch yourself.

692
00:49:29,492 --> 00:49:34,741
See for yourself: are you really in love with everyone?

693
00:49:36,283 --> 00:49:40,158
You see, I would say that

694
00:49:41,283 --> 00:49:44,033
all the time when I - sometimes I go for shopping,

695
00:49:44,283 --> 00:49:47,659
I just think, "Oh, this one would be nice for this one,

696
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:50,409
that will be nice for that one."

697
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,617
For Myself if you say,

698
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:55,325
it's impossible for Me to buy anything for Myself,

699
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:59,033
impossible situation.

700
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,325
Unless and until it is absolutely immediate,

701
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:07,617
or some problem is there if I am just without it.

702
00:50:07,908 --> 00:50:10,659
I won't even buy a drink for Myself,

703
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:12,367
even if I am thirsty.

704
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:15,699
Because the whole thing is the joy of others.

705
00:50:16,075 --> 00:50:18,659
"Oh, this will be nice for that person.

706
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:21,534
This will be good for that person."

707
00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:30,450
All this is the most enjoyable thing.

708
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:33,783
I mean, why all this is for there?

709
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:35,991
After all, think about yourself,

710
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,242
"Why am I here?

711
00:50:41,659 --> 00:50:45,200
I'm here to enjoy everyone - everyone.

712
00:50:45,741 --> 00:50:48,575
They are all realized souls,

713
00:50:49,242 --> 00:50:52,450
such beautiful lotuses.

714
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,075
I'm not going to stoop down to the mud.

715
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:00,450
Now I am a lotus."

716
00:51:03,325 --> 00:51:08,783
That is the way you open the heart,

717
00:51:10,991 --> 00:51:13,659
the lotus of your heart.

718
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:18,699
And the fragrance of such a person is so beautiful,

719
00:51:19,908 --> 00:51:24,242
is so beautiful.

720
00:51:26,242 --> 00:51:28,783
So you are no more divisive,

721
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,534
you do not want to separate from each other.

722
00:51:31,783 --> 00:51:36,117
Anywhere is done, you are agreeable to that;

723
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,242
you don't think that it should be done here

724
00:51:38,575 --> 00:51:40,659
or there or there, but anywhere

725
00:51:40,866 --> 00:51:45,450
- but should be all of us together.

726
00:51:47,075 --> 00:51:51,659
So the small attachments that are with you

727
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:55,908
have to be dissolved into this ocean of love,

728
00:51:56,242 --> 00:51:59,741
which is Shiva.

729
00:52:05,492 --> 00:52:08,783
Fourth one is the most important

730
00:52:09,325 --> 00:52:11,575
for all of us is to know

731
00:52:11,908 --> 00:52:15,783
that there's a nadi which passes through left Vishuddhi

732
00:52:17,158 --> 00:52:18,991
into the heart.

733
00:52:19,242 --> 00:52:22,575
Starts from the heart, goes up,

734
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:25,450
passes through Agnya.

735
00:52:25,783 --> 00:52:29,492
It has four petals, and opens up.

736
00:52:34,492 --> 00:52:37,575
This is the one which gives

737
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,991
you the state which is called as turya.

738
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:46,450
We live in three states.

739
00:52:46,741 --> 00:52:50,242
In the living - in the awakened state,

740
00:52:50,575 --> 00:52:54,659
jagruti, our attention goes to this, that, and all that;

741
00:52:54,866 --> 00:52:57,450
we spoil our attention.

742
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:04,325
But the second one is the one what we call

743
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:06,367
is that we sleep.

744
00:53:06,575 --> 00:53:10,325
When we sleep also

745
00:53:11,283 --> 00:53:12,825
all these things that have happened

746
00:53:13,117 --> 00:53:15,991
come to us from our past and things like that.

747
00:53:18,117 --> 00:53:21,991
But then we go to the deeper sleep called as sushupti.

748
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:27,200
Is a state where

749
00:53:28,117 --> 00:53:30,450
you have deep sleep,

750
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:34,534
and you dream of something that is reality also.

751
00:53:35,534 --> 00:53:38,659
You may dream about Me.

752
00:53:39,534 --> 00:53:43,741
Like it's the ethereal part of the subconscious,

753
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,409
where some beautiful

754
00:53:48,741 --> 00:53:50,450
informations are passed on.

755
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,950
Supposing I've come, say, to Italy.

756
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,075
Italians might know in their sushupti

757
00:53:55,409 --> 00:53:57,866
that I have come here, or maybe anybody might know

758
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,866
- depends on.

759
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,075
But the fourth state is called as turya.

760
00:54:02,325 --> 00:54:03,659
There are two more states.

761
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,825
You are in the turya state, it's the fourth,

762
00:54:06,158 --> 00:54:07,866
"turya" means fourth.

763
00:54:08,283 --> 00:54:11,950
Fourth state is where that you are

764
00:54:12,325 --> 00:54:15,409
in a thoughtless awareness state.

765
00:54:17,033 --> 00:54:21,866
When there is no thought - just think of it

766
00:54:22,866 --> 00:54:26,950
- when there is no thought, you have to be innocent.

767
00:54:27,825 --> 00:54:32,325
When there is no thought, you have to have vibrations.

768
00:54:33,283 --> 00:54:37,200
When there is no thought, you cannot be attached to anyone.

769
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,617
So into that thoughtless state you have come now,

770
00:54:40,866 --> 00:54:42,534
is the "turya sthiti."

771
00:54:42,825 --> 00:54:46,534
And in this state when you are,

772
00:54:48,325 --> 00:54:52,617
these four petals which are within you

773
00:54:53,158 --> 00:54:56,950
have to open out in your brain.

774
00:54:58,659 --> 00:55:02,158
They come from your heart to your brain.

775
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:10,325
And that is when

776
00:55:12,825 --> 00:55:18,534
you absolutely understand what is God,

777
00:55:23,617 --> 00:55:28,450
absolutely you know what is God is.

778
00:55:30,534 --> 00:55:34,908
That is the time when

779
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:41,991
one receives the real knowledge.

780
00:55:48,534 --> 00:55:51,575
But unless and until these four petals open,

781
00:55:51,866 --> 00:55:53,699
one may fall back,

782
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:56,783
and that's why some of the Sahaja yogis

783
00:55:57,242 --> 00:56:01,783
who are still meddling with things

784
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:05,534
that they should not do, go down.

785
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,908
And they don't understand what is God is.

786
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:14,741
But it's not the understanding

787
00:56:15,075 --> 00:56:16,908
- in a way you understand this one little point,

788
00:56:17,325 --> 00:56:21,117
that it comes from your heart into your brain,

789
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:25,075
not from brain to your heart.

790
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:30,367
It comes

791
00:56:30,741 --> 00:56:33,991
as if the ambrosia of

792
00:56:34,283 --> 00:56:38,534
your bhakti covers your brain, absolutely.

793
00:56:41,158 --> 00:56:42,283
Say for example,

794
00:56:42,534 --> 00:56:45,617
Shankaracharya wrote a beautiful treatise

795
00:56:45,908 --> 00:56:47,242
called as "Viveka Chudamani"

796
00:56:47,534 --> 00:56:50,158
where he described what is God, this, that;

797
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:52,908
and "viveka" means the conscience,

798
00:56:53,283 --> 00:56:57,033
and consciousness and all that he described quite a lot.

799
00:56:58,409 --> 00:57:00,617
But there was one horrible fellow called Sarma

800
00:57:00,866 --> 00:57:04,075
who started arguing with him and he got fed up,

801
00:57:04,409 --> 00:57:05,825
Shankaracharya.

802
00:57:06,117 --> 00:57:08,409
He said, "No use talking to them."

803
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:11,534
So he just wrote "Saundarya Lahari."

804
00:57:11,866 --> 00:57:14,699
"Saundarya Lahari" is nothing but all the mantras

805
00:57:14,908 --> 00:57:15,741
praising the Mother.

806
00:57:16,075 --> 00:57:18,367
He said, "Why, I know Mother, now let me praise Her.

807
00:57:18,659 --> 00:57:22,242
Nothing doing - what's the use of talking to these people?

808
00:57:22,699 --> 00:57:24,783
Stupid things, how will they understand?"

809
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:29,699
He realized that "These people haven't got that capacity,

810
00:57:29,991 --> 00:57:34,575
that sensitivity to understand what I know."

811
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:40,325
That's the real knowledge, is to know what is God.

812
00:57:40,741 --> 00:57:43,200
And if that is God,

813
00:57:43,534 --> 00:57:46,741
then how can you suspect anything,

814
00:57:47,075 --> 00:57:50,075
how can you

815
00:57:51,033 --> 00:57:53,033
try to analyze anything?

816
00:57:53,325 --> 00:57:57,033
It's God. It's God Almighty,

817
00:57:57,492 --> 00:57:59,741
which knows everything,

818
00:58:00,158 --> 00:58:02,158
which does everything,

819
00:58:02,617 --> 00:58:05,325
which enjoys everything.

820
00:58:05,908 --> 00:58:09,700
That is the one you should say is the gyana,

821
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:11,741
is the knowledge, is the true knowledge,

822
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:13,158
the pure knowledge.

823
00:58:13,492 --> 00:58:15,700
It's not the knowledge of chakras,

824
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,075
not the knowledge of vibrations,

825
00:58:18,534 --> 00:58:20,325
not the knowledge of kundalini,

826
00:58:20,659 --> 00:58:25,075
but the knowledge of God Almighty.

827
00:58:25,575 --> 00:58:29,158
And the knowledge of God Almighty is not mental.

828
00:58:29,492 --> 00:58:30,699
Again I tell you,

829
00:58:30,908 --> 00:58:35,450
it starts from your heart and goes to your brain,

830
00:58:36,242 --> 00:58:42,908
something that comes out of your experience of joy

831
00:58:43,325 --> 00:58:44,617
and covers your brain.

832
00:58:44,866 --> 00:58:47,492
So your brain cannot deny it any more.

833
00:58:47,783 --> 00:58:50,700
Like the - sometimes when you have your mother,

834
00:58:51,033 --> 00:58:54,158
little mother, you know the love of your mother.

835
00:58:54,492 --> 00:58:57,699
But you cannot explain, it comes from your heart

836
00:58:58,033 --> 00:58:59,450
and you say, "No, that's my mother,

837
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:02,575
she won't do like that. I know my mother very well."

838
00:59:02,991 --> 00:59:04,699
The knowledge about your mother,

839
00:59:05,033 --> 00:59:07,450
the one who has given you birth;

840
00:59:07,866 --> 00:59:11,325
may not be, mother may not be very good or whatever it is.

841
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:14,033
But knowledge about God,

842
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:16,617
that He's love, that He's truth,

843
00:59:16,991 --> 00:59:18,741
that He knows everything,

844
00:59:19,117 --> 00:59:24,242
that just become part and parcel of your being, absolutely,

845
00:59:24,575 --> 00:59:29,200
and that's the time we say is the nirvana.

846
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,991
So it's important,

847
00:59:33,325 --> 00:59:36,242
specially for the people of the West,

848
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,699
now open your hearts,

849
00:59:38,991 --> 00:59:43,117
because it starts from the heart, not from your brain.

850
00:59:47,492 --> 00:59:49,991
Do not judge people on vibrations.

851
00:59:50,325 --> 00:59:53,866
Judge yourself, all the time.

852
00:59:54,325 --> 00:59:59,325
I had told that Shiva Puja means more explanation,

853
00:59:59,575 --> 01:00:01,617
more understanding, more this thing;

854
01:00:01,908 --> 01:00:07,783
because in other pujas we do all these mantras, this, that,

855
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:14,700
but in this puja is to know the knowledge,

856
01:00:15,158 --> 01:00:17,991
it's God.

857
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:22,450
And to know that you know God itself is so great.

858
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:28,283
Whatever it is - She may be Mahamaya,

859
01:00:28,534 --> 01:00:31,950
She may be anything, but I know Her.

860
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:34,075
It cannot be described in one book,

861
01:00:34,325 --> 01:00:36,991
it cannot be described in hundred books.

862
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:40,409
It cannot be described in words,

863
01:00:40,741 --> 01:00:45,325
but to know that's God - after all, that's God,

864
01:00:45,825 --> 01:00:48,617
God Almighty.

865
01:00:50,908 --> 01:00:53,699
And that gives you

866
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:57,575
that beautiful surrender,

867
01:00:57,991 --> 01:01:01,783
where you just feel absolutely secured

868
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:07,242
in that ocean of love.

869
01:01:08,033 --> 01:01:10,700
I wish you all to achieve that state.

870
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,158
May God bless you.
