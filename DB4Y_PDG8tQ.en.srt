1
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:31,500
We close the door, I think it would be good.

2
00:01:50,618 --> 00:01:54,117
I am happy that you all were meditating here,

3
00:01:54,263 --> 00:02:00,888
and were trying to develop your depth.

4
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:07,783
You all have depth, a very deep personality within yourself.

5
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,441
But we have to touch that,

6
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:11,931
that's very important,

7
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:16,759
because you see, we sing, have music, that's a very good thing;

8
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:20,351
we enjoy each other's company, also is very good

9
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:22,173
and that's a nice thing.

10
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:26,248
But we have to enjoy our own company also

11
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:30,617
by meditating, going within yourself.

12
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:34,783
Now, "What is the use?"

13
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,371
one may ask. "Mother, now we have got realization,

14
00:02:37,438 --> 00:02:40,835
we have a nice life, we are enjoying ourselves,

15
00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:43,830
we are doing so well."

16
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:49,410
The deeper you go, the deeper you touch the essences

17
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:53,212
of all the things, like all the elements.

18
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:55,934
When you had finished your meditation

19
00:02:56,117 --> 00:02:58,201
you saw how the rain fell down,

20
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:00,403
how the rain came suddenly.

21
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,347
So rain has felt your depth,

22
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:06,061
or you have felt the depth of rain.

23
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:09,176
Now you know that if you light one little candle

24
00:03:09,451 --> 00:03:13,034
and put your finger towards it with My photograph there,

25
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:15,986
it acts, it reacts

26
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:18,783
and it gives you a flame which burns,

27
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,867
sometimes gives you smoke, sometimes it gallops.

28
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:29,618
So you have noticed that there's a reaction, even in the fire.

29
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:34,367
So all elements have got an effect,

30
00:03:34,618 --> 00:03:40,034
if a saint wants to have an effect.

31
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:44,117
But first of all you must reach your own essences.

32
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:46,409
Once you reach your own essences,

33
00:03:46,618 --> 00:03:53,034
then you reach the essences of all the elements,

34
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:57,034
and then you can handle all the elements as you like

35
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:59,284
or you can order them as you like.

36
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:01,367
First they will act,

37
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:03,867
expressing that they have been touched

38
00:04:04,117 --> 00:04:07,618
like today, the rain came pouring down.

39
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:11,284
Then later on you can command,

40
00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:14,451
and you can ask the rain to come.

41
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:18,534
To work out many things of that kind

42
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:20,618
we have to be deep people,

43
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:25,117
we have to go much deeper within ourselves to touch our essences.

44
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:26,618
That is, you know very well

45
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:30,534
that all our chakras are made out of these essences,

46
00:04:30,783 --> 00:04:32,950
and when we go deep into ourselves,

47
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:39,034
what we find that we can touch the elements very well.

48
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:44,201
But while doing so, actually we move horizontally.

49
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,783
When we start moving horizontally,

50
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:52,367
at the core of it we find that there are these essences placed,

51
00:04:52,618 --> 00:04:57,701
and these essences then start exciting the essences across.

52
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:01,451
Like in the radio you have seen there's ether.

53
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:06,409
Now when you speak on one side of the radio,

54
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:13,618
it gets completely manifested in the essence of the ether

55
00:05:13,784 --> 00:05:16,117
and then everybody can hear it.

56
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:22,783
Now when you people just give a bandhan sometimes,

57
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,284
you find that you have communicated with another person.

58
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:33,783
But that's only the essence of the ether

59
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,075
we can say, the subtler of the subtlest.

60
00:05:37,284 --> 00:05:40,034
People have only gone onto the subtler side,

61
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:42,367
we can say, by science,

62
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:46,117
but you go to the subtlest side, and that subtlest side

63
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:48,784
gives you all these effects.

64
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:52,534
Now you have seen also that in some of the photographs

65
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:55,784
suddenly you find light coming out of My head,

66
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:58,783
or there's somebody shown as with the light,

67
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,701
somebody's with the head the light is coming

68
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:03,201
you have seen all this.

69
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:07,034
This is done also by the same method,

70
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:11,534
but here the deities like Vishnumaya works out.

71
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:13,867
She's very active, She works it out,

72
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:15,701
She does all these things.

73
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:19,201
And you know that also that when they gave Me once

74
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:23,367
a beautiful crown in Switzerland,

75
00:06:23,576 --> 00:06:29,701
in the sky they got the photograph of the same.

76
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:33,701
Very beautifully done, the crown was there,

77
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:37,783
Fatima's crown, My face, My eyes and everything so clearly.

78
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,963
All this is done by Vishnumaya.

79
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:44,015
So all the, all the

80
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:51,764
all the essences are

81
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:57,242
working out for you. As well as
all the deities areare working out for you.

82
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:01,284
They are very anxious that these things should be done,

83
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:05,367
and you are the channels for them to work it out.

84
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:08,284
Now for example, as I told you the other day,

85
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:10,618
if you don't keep yourself all right.

86
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:14,659
A simple thing I have told you, to put in the nose some ghee.

87
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:17,701
It's a very simple thing but that helps Me a lot,

88
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:19,618
because that helps My Vishuddhi.

89
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:22,159
But if you don't do it I suck in, in any case,

90
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,618
whatever problems you have, I suck in.

91
00:07:24,784 --> 00:07:28,618
I suck in the problem of Sahaja yogis,

92
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:31,534
also the problem of the city where I am,

93
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,743
also the problem of the country where I am,

94
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:36,117
maybe of the whole universe.

95
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:41,367
But My horizontal movement is quite large and is very subtle,

96
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:43,451
and I do it quietly.

97
00:07:43,618 --> 00:07:45,367
But you must also understand

98
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:48,784
that you can do a lot by your horizontal movement.

99
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:51,201
By horizontal movement what happens

100
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:55,034
that you start meditating on a particular subject

101
00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:57,534
which is a very bothersome subject,

102
00:07:57,783 --> 00:08:01,242
and which is for the destructive of humanity.

103
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:06,534
Anything -- you just put your attention to it and meditate.

104
00:08:06,743 --> 00:08:08,326
If you are that deep,

105
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:11,534
that means if your caliber has improved to that extent,

106
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:14,909
you will immediately put an effect on that.

107
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:18,117
Immediately you will see there will be a change,

108
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:21,284
there will be something happening in that direction.

109
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,701
This is your power which you have to actually develop.

110
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:26,534
So we have to meditate,

111
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:30,950
and by meditation we develop that strength within us,

112
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:36,493
so automatically we start solving the problem.

113
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:39,950
Like our antennae grow up to that point:

114
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,034
the way we are strong inside, they grow outside

115
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:49,784
to help so many things which are to be helped.

116
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:52,201
Now you see that people are realizing

117
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:55,659
that the world is in a great mess,

118
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:57,867
and there are lots of problems that have come

119
00:08:58,117 --> 00:09:00,867
through materialism, through wrong thinking,

120
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:04,867
through emotional thinking, through stupidity we can say.

121
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:07,117
We have no time for all this.

122
00:09:07,284 --> 00:09:11,117
What we have to do is to develop ourselves deeper and deeper

123
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:17,117
and deeper, so that on horizontal plane also we are effective.

124
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:21,783
Sahaja Yoga first of all is for personal improvement,

125
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,367
is for the inner improvement as far
as the personal side is concerned

126
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:29,867
means your intelligence must improve,

127
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:32,451
your temperament must improve,

128
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:34,618
your heart must clear out,

129
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,534
your feelings must be all right.

130
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,367
Then you should, your health should be all right,

131
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:44,534
then your relationship with others should be all right,

132
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:46,284
your ego should go away,

133
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:48,201
your superego should go away

134
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:50,618
all these things are there.

135
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:52,784
But this only helps a personality,

136
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:56,784
just a personality that is very limited, that is yourself.

137
00:09:57,034 --> 00:10:00,242
But now this personality can become an instrument,

138
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:03,367
if you can develop that depth within yourself.

139
00:10:03,618 --> 00:10:06,117
But normally what happens, people are

140
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:09,117
very much still worried about themselves,

141
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:11,618
say about their wives, about their children,

142
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:17,867
about their husbands or their household, or this and that.

143
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:22,451
These are not important things, because we have to be those

144
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:26,783
instruments which are what you call them, like pilotless bombs,

145
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,534
we have to develop that depth within us.

146
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:31,284
That depth is possible,

147
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:35,784
and you can really cure many problems of your country

148
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,825
if you could just meditate on them.

149
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:43,618
Now for today, I had actually sucked in most of the problems

150
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:47,034
which I had felt were there in Canberra

151
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:53,534
and later on in that conference, and later on here.

152
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:58,825
All these problems came into My understanding,

153
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:02,326
I would say, and I was trying to work on them.

154
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:06,701
My working style is different because I have very sharp

155
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,284
and very effective instruments.

156
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:12,367
But I have to pay attention to it

157
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:15,117
and I a little bit suffer also, doesn't matter.

158
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:19,201
Now for you also, it is important that you also develop

159
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:21,783
those deeper feelings within you,

160
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,743
deeper sense within you.

161
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:27,034
But mostly people are very superficial type.

162
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:29,367
They just think about their body,

163
00:11:29,534 --> 00:11:33,367
their impressions, how they carry themselves.

164
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:37,701
At the most they'll think we have to be very legal-minded,

165
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:43,867
or we have to be at the most not drinking, not smoking,

166
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:49,367
and all these things are achieved and we have achieved everything.

167
00:11:49,618 --> 00:11:52,534
But I think that is not so.

168
00:11:52,701 --> 00:11:56,783
And second point is that we think that if we love each other,

169
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,117
if we love Mother, that is the end of everything.

170
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,701
It's not true also,

171
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:06,201
because you see, your love for Me is there no doubt

172
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,701
and it should be intense, it should be deeper;

173
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:10,783
but the deeper you go into that love,

174
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:16,534
then you will be surprised how you receive a special quality

175
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:20,367
of correcting the things that are wrong around you.

176
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:23,367
Gradually that quality improves.

177
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,950
For example, a Sahaja yogi goes to anybody's house,

178
00:12:27,117 --> 00:12:30,618
that house must become auspicious.

179
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,618
But such a Sahaja yogi must have a good heart.

180
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:38,534
If the heart is not good, in the heart there is still

181
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:45,451
anger, passion, lust, greed,

182
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:47,367
then such a heart won't affect.

183
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:49,701
But a person who has purified himself,

184
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:54,784
if he goes into any family, any household, any society,

185
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:58,701
the whole change will take place.

186
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:01,783
The circumstances will change.

187
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,117
Things that do not work out will start working out immediately.

188
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,075
Like they said, "Mother, as soon as You

189
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:10,117
sent from this Sunday, everything started working out

190
00:13:10,326 --> 00:13:13,159
as far as the television is concerned

191
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:15,783
and radio is concerned."

192
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,867
I didn't do anything -- in a way.

193
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,284
But that should happen with you also.

194
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:27,367
Wherever a saint goes, things are changing.

195
00:13:27,534 --> 00:13:29,451
But you have to be a saint,

196
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:35,576
and a saintly person has a very deep understanding

197
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:39,576
of another person,

198
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:43,618
and this is what it is lacking:

199
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:47,825
we don't have that deep understanding for each other.

200
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:53,783
Then even if you have for some of your own friends,

201
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,284
or maybe in the same ashram that you are staying and all that

202
00:13:58,534 --> 00:14:02,201
but it should deepen much more.

203
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:07,534
You should go further and further.

204
00:14:08,242 --> 00:14:11,659
Now even if you think of Me, it works out.

205
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:14,867
It's the other way round also.

206
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:20,201
But first of all the meditative process should be increased.

207
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:23,992
We all must meditate, that is very important

208
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:26,825
meditate sincerely.

209
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:30,618
Not just because we have to meditate

210
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:36,909
but because we have to be deep, we have to grow within

211
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:46,159
to express our great powers of divine love;

212
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:51,034
to correct so many things, which you can do very easily

213
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:55,159
I know you all can do it.

214
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:58,618
There's no need to have big degrees for that,

215
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:02,409
big education for that, nothing is needed.

216
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:06,701
What is needed is a deep feeling

217
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:12,950
of love for the whole universe, and that changes.

218
00:15:13,117 --> 00:15:16,618
The all-destructive forces change their course,

219
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:21,034
and it is then for the constructive forces.

220
00:15:21,284 --> 00:15:29,034
But on the whole that works out much faster if you all

221
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:35,034
do that meditation with sincerity, with intensity,

222
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:38,367
with understanding. All right?

223
00:15:38,576 --> 00:15:41,867
May God bless you.

224
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,395
It is much more than our music,

225
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:55,563
much more than My lectures or anything, that we have to do.

226
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:57,809
And now the course has to change.

227
00:15:57,985 --> 00:16:01,901
I am sure you people will take to the new course.

228
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:05,751
So may God bless you for that.

229
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,389
Have you got any questions?

230
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:38,333
Yogi: There seems to be some difference of opinion on parts

231
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:45,261
of the body that are represented here, and here, and there.
Could You tell us please, Shri Mataji?

232
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,975
I see.

233
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:56,136
These chakras are represented outside also

234
00:16:56,311 --> 00:16:59,160
in our body, we can say,

235
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:03,228
that on our feet as you know:

236
00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:10,809
you know the Nabhi,

237
00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:14,436
Nabhi is the thumb* (you be seated and I’ll tell you; you’ll know)

238
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:16,574
– Nabhi is the thumb,

239
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:21,074
and left and right Nabhi.

240
00:17:21,469 --> 00:17:27,404
Then second finger from the thumb is the Vishuddhi,

241
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:41,451
the third finger is the Swadhishthana,

242
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,829
the fourth finger is the Agya,

243
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:50,604
and the fifth finger is the Heart.

244
00:17:52,229 --> 00:17:56,483
Now this is the – our basis.

245
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,767
Then in the hands they change,

246
00:18:00,172 --> 00:18:05,283
as you know. In the hands you know very well,
I need not tell about the hands.

247
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,402
Now in your hand,

248
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:15,400
we can say, this one here is the Lalita Chakra,

249
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,697
also is the part of the Vishuddhi Chakra.

250
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:22,132
It works out the Vishuddhi Chakra, Lalita Chakra.

251
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:26,729
And then this is the Nabhi

252
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:31,294
and this is the Vishuddhi

253
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,666
Swadhishthana is in between, you can say.

254
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:44,404
Now, Heart is here

255
00:18:44,785 --> 00:18:51,407
so any time you have this finger paining too much,

256
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,526
then you must know there’s some trouble with the Heart.

257
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:57,442
But Heart is not in all these things,

258
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:02,587
but sometimes, sometimes it could be felt here

259
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:07,738
Heart Chakra can be felt here with
a reflection maybe, on this side.

260
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:11,028
So we can do like this, is to say:

261
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:16,451
Vishuddhi, Heart, then Nabhi, then Swadhishthana,

262
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:19,887
and then … sorry!

263
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:24,892
This is the Vishuddhi

264
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,835
this is Swadhishthana

265
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:34,305
this is Heart

266
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:37,937
and this is Nabhi

267
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:41,214
and this one is

268
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:51,950
but I never use them, so I just don’t know!

269
00:19:55,102 --> 00:20:00,959
Heart and this is Vishuddhi. All right?

270
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:04,876
But you can feel it sometimes even Heart here

271
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:09,024
because if Swadhishthana is very active your Heart goes out,

272
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:10,611
so you can feel it here.

273
00:20:10,763 --> 00:20:17,790
It’s a very important thing that
we should have that discrimination,

274
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:21,485
because if I tell you something maybe you are

275
00:20:21,564 --> 00:20:25,699
not yet that level of discretion, and you may get confused.

276
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:30,452
So this is the Vishuddhi

277
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:36,457
Now there is pain here, that means there is problem with your Vishuddhi.

278
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:43,059
Now sometimes you have a problem, say, on your Vishuddhi

279
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:48,419
– now you can pull this finger. Just to pull the finger nicely,

280
00:20:48,991 --> 00:20:53,724
and you’ll be surprised, the vibrations
coming out of left Vishuddhi.

281
00:20:55,112 --> 00:20:59,127
Any one, you have any problem, you can pull them.

282
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:04,449
And that is how all the chakras are placed in the body.

283
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:13,066
In the same way downward if you move, this is the Nabhi

284
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:16,395
this is the Swadhishthana, both are Swadhishthana

285
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:24,017
and this is the Heart and

286
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,608
this is the Vishuddhi at the ankle bone.

287
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:39,563
This is Vishuddhi at the ankle bone.

288
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,822
So the main thing to remember are the Vishuddhis, because

289
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,894
Vishuddhi, Nabhi and Swadhishthan:

290
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,197
these three are important,

291
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,623
because they go off immediately as soon as
– supposing there is a Nabhi patient sitting with you,

292
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:55,452
you’ll immediately have a problem on your Nabhi

293
00:21:55,688 --> 00:21:59,229
But these sometimes manifest, not all the time,

294
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,471
so they can be confusing.

295
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:03,557
But Swadhishthana specially.

296
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:08,441
Like, when I got down in Canberra I just couldn’t walk,
both the Swadhishthanas went like that, you see.

297
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:10,179
I didn’t know how to move.

298
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:12,917
It was terrible because both the Swadhishthanas were caught up

299
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:14,838
– for a while, but they were.

300
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:18,729
So it is indicative of those things.

301
00:22:24,381 --> 00:22:28,015
Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You please
tell us more about Hamsa Chakra?

302
00:22:28,238 --> 00:22:29,706
Hamsa Chakra?

303
00:22:30,845 --> 00:22:34,226
Hamsa Chakra is placed here

304
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:37,226
where some of the nerves

305
00:22:37,584 --> 00:22:40,927
which are coming from Ida and Pingala cross over,

306
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:48,119
and is a part of Vishuddhi Chakra.

307
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:54,205
Plus the connection with Vishuddhi and Agya:

308
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:58,939
as you must have read in the Devi Mahatmyam that

309
00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:02,987
Shri Krishna is the Father of Christ,

310
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:07,823
so the connection between the two is maintained here.

311
00:23:08,744 --> 00:23:11,799
And this is very important, Hamsa Chakra is,

312
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:17,417
that if your Hamsa Chakra is not all right,
your discretion is very poor.

313
00:23:18,612 --> 00:23:22,943
This chakra will get easily dried out.

314
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:26,757
Like if you eat very dried food, you see.

315
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:34,919
Say, sometimes you also offer Me some dried food,
and I have to tell you that not to give too dry food.

316
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:41,787
You must eat it with some sauce or some liquid thing,
because if you eat very dry food

317
00:23:41,904 --> 00:23:44,014
also this becomes very dry.

318
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:46,659
And it’s very important

319
00:23:46,806 --> 00:23:50,244
because if this portion becomes dry,

320
00:23:50,357 --> 00:23:55,119
you can put some oil or ghee into it to make it all right.

321
00:23:55,469 --> 00:24:01,714
But from here starts the drying of the peritoneum and the lining.

322
00:24:02,611 --> 00:24:05,212
If the peritoneum gets dried up,

323
00:24:05,249 --> 00:24:07,121
the whole body gets dried up.

324
00:24:07,249 --> 00:24:10,447
It can be anywhere; in the lung if it is dried up

325
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:12,776
 it can cause you lung cancer.

326
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:17,387
As even the peritoneum can be in a cancer state.

327
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:21,669
So one has to be very careful not to take something very dry,

328
00:24:21,784 --> 00:24:25,820
all the time dry food and dry things.

329
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:30,999
Moreover, not to put anything to make this a lubricant

330
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:37,143
– some sort of a lubricant should be
there so there’s no problem on this chakra.

331
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:40,818
Because first of all it loses your discretion,

332
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:44,781
you don’t understand things,
you don’t know what to do. You mean it,

333
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:50,877
you mean good, but you don’t do.
When you achieve something, it’s something not so good.

334
00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:53,223
The reason is, your discretion is poor.

335
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:56,831
For that this must not be made dry.

336
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:04,989
I have told many a times to put some

337
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:09,259
ghee every day. Get a little bottle of ghee,

338
00:25:10,178 --> 00:25:13,354
keep it with you with a little dropper.

339
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:15,390
You can put it in the hot water,

340
00:25:15,545 --> 00:25:21,626
you can heat it up every day, and take two drops in the nose

341
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:26,698
in the night and in the morning time.
It doesn’t take much, but it should be done.

342
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:30,650
It’s for your good.

343
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:36,467
That’s the only ritual I think we follow, do we

344
00:25:36,564 --> 00:25:38,426
– have we any other ritual?

345
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:43,138
We don’t even make a cross!

346
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,302
Anything else?

347
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:59,048
Yogi: Shri Mother, last two years ago when You were here
at Burwood, You were saying how we’ve gone beyond nirvichara

348
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:07,570
and we’re into savikalpa, and we’re reaching nirvikalpa.
Could You please tell us a little about savikalpa?

349
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:17,121
First stage is nirvikalpa where you become thoughtless in between,

350
00:26:17,297 --> 00:26:19,884
then you become, again come to thought,

351
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:21,568
again you become thoughtless.

352
00:26:21,672 --> 00:26:24,790
That’s a very good stage where you start,

353
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:29,953
and you start growing up into that.

354
00:26:30,311 --> 00:26:33,809
Now savikalp can be before or after this stage,

355
00:26:33,944 --> 00:26:37,584
like savikalpa is – “vikalpa” means doubt,

356
00:26:37,818 --> 00:26:40,046
and “savikalpa” means with doubt.

357
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,943
So you are still growing with the doubts in your mind.

358
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:45,983
There are people who still grow with doubts in their mind.

359
00:26:46,192 --> 00:26:50,029
For example you see, somebody feels hurt in Sahaja Yoga,

360
00:26:50,236 --> 00:26:52,195
some way he’s hurt

361
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:58,231
that “I’ve been hurt in Sahaja Yoga”
– something, the subconscious is there.

362
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:01,678
Then he still has that feeling within himself, “I’m hurt,

363
00:27:01,824 --> 00:27:05,300
but still I must do Sahaja Yoga, it is good.” Mentally he accepts

364
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:10,712
and goes on with it, so he can get into nirvikalp state with that.

365
00:27:10,821 --> 00:27:13,233
Or maybe he gets to nirvikalpa state

366
00:27:13,337 --> 00:27:17,540
and then again goes to savikalpa. That’s a flashback.

367
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:22,424
And could be he can say, “All right, I’ll do it in nirvichara,

368
00:27:22,528 --> 00:27:26,676
but from nirvichara I can go to,

369
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:32,863
you see, my doubts also. After all I have my doubts,
what things and this and that is possible.”

370
00:27:32,975 --> 00:27:36,261
And some people have a hidden anger within themselves,

371
00:27:36,381 --> 00:27:41,010
or kind of a hidden feelings or hidden things

372
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:46,897
which he’s not very aware of, too,
so he has also got the vikalpas with him.

373
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:49,738
So with savikalpa samadhi is that,

374
00:27:49,904 --> 00:27:54,361
so it can be after or before nirvichara samadhi.

375
00:27:54,457 --> 00:27:58,058
So I mean, you go, fall on to it sometime.

376
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:01,493
So we’ll have to go beyond actually savikalpa,

377
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:04,967
because nirvichar samadhi is not sufficient enough.

378
00:28:05,134 --> 00:28:08,181
All the vikalpas, all the doubts must go away,

379
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:11,152
then you’ll reach the state of nirvikalpa.

380
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:14,103
Then there’s no doubt, there’s no problem.

381
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,534
There are many among you who are like that,

382
00:28:17,938 --> 00:28:20,414
who are not yet aware that they are like that.

383
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:26,238
That’s why I’m requesting you to develop
this new dimension in your creative work.

384
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:42,520
Yogi: Shri Mataji, how can we sustain
a deep meditation throughout the day?

385
00:28:42,544 --> 00:28:52,770
I just say, when we reach an hight in meditation,
howe can we sustain it during the whole day.

386
00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:54,657
How can we say?

387
00:28:55,109 --> 00:29:01,995
Other Yogi: How can we sustain that meditation trought out
of the day. Sustaining the meditation that we had in the morning.

388
00:29:03,712 --> 00:29:07,006
You see, you are in meditation in a way.

389
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,752
You are halfway in meditation and halfway not.

390
00:29:10,997 --> 00:29:15,044
Now if you try to develop a state of witness,

391
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,666
then you are in meditation

392
00:29:17,913 --> 00:29:21,103
– just a state of witness. Whatever you see, just watch it.

393
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,937
Just watching is the best way,

394
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:28,801
and then you’ll be surprised that you will find that
you are in another world, these people are only in another world.

395
00:29:28,918 --> 00:29:30,562
You are seeing them from another world.

396
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:32,736
Then you will have compassion for them,

397
00:29:32,912 --> 00:29:34,888
you will have pity for them,

398
00:29:35,015 --> 00:29:37,684
you may also not like them –

399
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:43,093
it’s all these feelings will come up to you,
but you’ll be a person who is separated from them.

400
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:56,472
[Yogi: Sometimes...

401
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,723
you can feel that you in yourself,
in your center you are all right,

402
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:08,452
but you move in circumstances
that cause a disharmony in some other part of you.]

403
00:30:10,187 --> 00:30:12,345
That is the savikalpa state.

404
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:14,522
That is you move, you see,

405
00:30:14,685 --> 00:30:17,270
though you are in that state of

406
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:22,136
nirvichara, still you move to savikalpa state

407
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:26,370
where you again get vikalpa. But you are, you are after all

408
00:30:26,472 --> 00:30:29,440
a realized soul, you see. So they have made three

409
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,162
clear-cut things, that you can have savikalpa samadhi,

410
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,217
you can have nirvichara samadhi and you can have

411
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:38,910
 pure nirvikalpa samadhi.

412
00:30:39,624 --> 00:30:42,176
Now from even that state, you see,

413
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,711
you can get to that,

414
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,873
and that’s what you have to cut out –

415
00:30:47,087 --> 00:30:49,992
is to, when you see such a situation

416
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:55,173
where you get involved, then you say, “This is not, this is not,”

417
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:56,899
and come out of it.

418
00:30:57,283 --> 00:31:00,124
It’s a practice, a little practice can tell you.

419
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:04,350
Like driving, by practice you master it in the same way.

420
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:11,112
When I know something is wrong, I know it is wrong

421
00:31:11,156 --> 00:31:14,691
and I know that they are doing wrong, but I just keep quiet

422
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:18,521
and then they know what it was wrong and what was right.

423
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:34,624
It is better to make others learn by mistakes than to tell them.

424
00:31:34,948 --> 00:31:37,115
No one likes to be told.

425
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:43,132
Then they learn themselves by mistakes,
“Yes, I’ve done this mistake, that mistakes. I’ve ruined my life.

426
00:31:43,197 --> 00:31:44,197
Now come along."

427
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:51,389
But if you tell them, they can be very
reluctant or could be vindictive also.

428
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,914
[Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You tell us
some more about the conscious mind?]

429
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:13,739
Shri Mataji: About? – Yogi: the conscious mind.

430
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:15,872
The conscious mind?
Yogi: Yes.

431
00:32:22,127 --> 00:32:27,282
What do you want to know about the conscious mind?

432
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:31,310
You see, conscious mind is the mind where you are awake

433
00:32:31,778 --> 00:32:34,067
and see things.

434
00:32:34,437 --> 00:32:37,357
But there is also unconscious mind behind it;

435
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:41,782
and there’s a subconscious mind, and there’s supraconscious mind,

436
00:32:42,455 --> 00:32:44,713
and beyond the supraconscious

437
00:32:44,947 --> 00:32:47,817
there is also collective supraconscious,

438
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:52,828
and beyond the subconscious there is collective subconscious.

439
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,947
There’s unconscious mind.

440
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:59,614
The unconscious mind is in a way, we can say is the Kundalini.

441
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:07,407
Now when She enters into your
conscious mind, you become enlightened.

442
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:13,029
The conscious mind is the mind that is aware

443
00:33:13,106 --> 00:33:18,514
of the surroundings, aware of
everyone being there, aware of all the things.

444
00:33:18,978 --> 00:33:22,668
But an enlightened conscious mind which is of a high level

445
00:33:22,823 --> 00:33:26,051
is much more conscious of things than you are.

446
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,565
For example, I am quite conscious
of people who are catching on the Heart,

447
00:33:32,264 --> 00:33:35,892
and I’m quite conscious of the people who are not yet there.

448
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:40,551
I’m quite conscious of the people who are perfectly there,

449
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:44,495
and I’m quite conscious of the people who are nowhere near.

450
00:33:44,665 --> 00:33:50,697
But it’s all right for Me, because I with My
conscious mind can raise them up.

451
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:53,230
So it’s a different situation with Me.

452
00:33:53,286 --> 00:33:58,465
But with other people could be
that your conscious mind is all the time,

453
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:04,387
depending on your level of advancement,
maybe worried about small, small things.

454
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:06,690
Like ...

455
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:13,332
“I have to go home now and it’s getting late,
and will I get a bus or not?” Could be like that.

456
00:34:13,578 --> 00:34:17,905
Then there could be another conscious mind which is thinking about

457
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:22,952
how far I can meditate,
how far I can go with it, all kinds of things.

458
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:28,085
But there could be a conscious mind
which is enlightened, if it is enlightened, it’s just

459
00:34:29,432 --> 00:34:32,529
just getting all the

460
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:35,540
essence of what I am saying,

461
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:38,364
and developing and nourishing itself.

462
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:42,266
So when you are enlightened, the conscious mind

463
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,595
is something like a

464
00:34:45,128 --> 00:34:47,845
tree into which the sap is now flowing.

465
00:34:47,988 --> 00:34:51,429
It may be that it is just like a leaf

466
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:56,446
or it may be it is like a flower, or maybe it is like a fruit.

467
00:34:57,091 --> 00:35:01,430
So it changes its forms once he gets realization.

468
00:35:01,722 --> 00:35:07,043
If a person gets realization then
the conscious mind moves on, getting more and more light.

469
00:35:07,086 --> 00:35:09,418
Say for example when the electricity comes

470
00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:13,194
you can see this room, you can see
another’s room, you can see another room,

471
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:18,925
you can go round and see and again, again you will see
it all the rooms, then you become aware of all the rooms

472
00:35:19,135 --> 00:35:21,150
So you are conscious of all these.

473
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:25,033
But in the beginning you are just
conscious of the room where you are standing.

474
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:26,223
Isn’t it?

475
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:28,263
So the conscious mind’s

476
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:31,120
definition cannot be given after realization.

477
00:35:31,322 --> 00:35:37,618
A person like Me, say for example, has a
conscious mind that might envelop the whole world.

478
00:35:37,806 --> 00:35:40,909
Or a conscious mind of a person who is realized soul

479
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:43,886
who is still not anywhere, just started,

480
00:35:44,103 --> 00:35:49,714
then he’s only conscious as to
where is right, where is left, where is this.

481
00:35:52,123 --> 00:35:56,648
So before the realization
the conscious mind sees things around.

482
00:35:56,841 --> 00:35:59,277
Out of that also there are categories.

483
00:35:59,382 --> 00:36:02,024
Some people see, say, for artists can see something,

484
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:05,154
and a scientist can see something,

485
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:07,985
another poet will see something,

486
00:36:08,192 --> 00:36:11,160
so it depends on the conscious mind how it is,

487
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:13,545
has got the trend. But

488
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:18,667
still it won’t see something that is subtle behind it.

489
00:36:19,063 --> 00:36:23,020
And that only is possible after you get your realization.

490
00:36:23,656 --> 00:36:24,751
All right?

491
00:36:28,836 --> 00:36:34,669
Yogi: Mother, sometimes ego masquerades as guru.

492
00:36:36,232 --> 00:36:39,797
 How can we tell when that’s going on in us?

493
00:36:42,787 --> 00:36:46,693
You see, when ego comes up

494
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:53,299
– I don’t know much about it, you see, because I haven’t got!

495
00:36:57,229 --> 00:37:00,278
We can say when ego comes up,

496
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:04,453
then a person becomes arbitrary.
First thing is he becomes arbitrary.

497
00:37:04,883 --> 00:37:09,258
It start, He’ll start deciding, “I’ll have this, I’ll have that,

498
00:37:09,426 --> 00:37:13,313
I like this” – you see? This is the one thing.

499
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:18,015
Secondly it takes out itself from the collective,

500
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,465
becomes very arbitrary, collective removes itself from you.

501
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:25,532
But the spirit is the other way round.

502
00:37:25,664 --> 00:37:28,970
Spirit is, it cares for the collective.

503
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,256
It doesn’t become arbitrary at all

504
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:37,240
and it never says “I like, I want.” Its “I” drops out.

505
00:37:37,643 --> 00:37:41,726
You see, you can easily see, very easily with your discrimination

506
00:37:41,932 --> 00:37:44,877
that egoistical person

507
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:48,651
is not even liked by the person who has ego.

508
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:55,751
If he sees himself in the mirror he says,
“Oh God, what’s this wretched nonsense? What a temperament it is!”

509
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,908
It will not like itself.

510
00:37:58,811 --> 00:38:03,208
There was a lady who was a very hot-tempered woman

511
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:08,122
and once she came to My puja,
and I said, “Now what is this heater you have brought before Me

512
00:38:08,215 --> 00:38:12,392
in India in the hot season" – one heater put before you.

513
00:38:12,628 --> 00:38:16,368
I said, “Oh God, please remove her, she’s like a heater.”

514
00:38:16,698 --> 00:38:18,503
Nobody understood it, you see,

515
00:38:18,658 --> 00:38:23,732
but I said, “Please remove her.”
So then they asked her, “You get down. Mother can’t bear you.”

516
00:38:24,252 --> 00:38:29,669
Then she was very angry,“What is this?
What’s wrong with me? What have I done?”

517
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:31,997
After some time, you see,

518
00:38:32,115 --> 00:38:37,765
people said that “we have nothing to do.”
Then nobody would talk to her, she was left alone,

519
00:38:38,086 --> 00:38:43,231
and then she was also very unhappy about it because
she was left alone. She thought, “What’s this? This is insulting.

520
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,168
Why should they leave me alone?”

521
00:38:45,744 --> 00:38:47,196
Then after some time

522
00:38:47,323 --> 00:38:51,710
she realized that “There must be something wrong with me,

523
00:38:52,057 --> 00:38:56,557
I must find out. There’s something
nonsensical about it, something filthy on me.

524
00:38:56,715 --> 00:38:58,079
I should throw it away.”

525
00:38:58,546 --> 00:39:04,708
Then she started working it out and seeing
herself and all that, and she became a very, very sweet person.

526
00:39:05,001 --> 00:39:08,101
But she dare not face Me, was quite afraid.

527
00:39:08,644 --> 00:39:12,604
So her daughter came to see Me one day.
I said, “How is your mother?”

528
00:39:12,652 --> 00:39:16,300
She said, “Mother, she’s all right.”
“You ask her to come and see Me.”

529
00:39:16,783 --> 00:39:19,444
So she said, “And I have never felt such joy

530
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:23,869
as I felt that day when You called me.”
I said, “I knew you have improved so much.”

531
00:39:23,972 --> 00:39:25,903
She came. I had taken a watch for her.

532
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:29,757
She said, “Mother, You have brought a watch for me?”
I said, “Yes, I have brought a watch for you.”

533
00:39:29,803 --> 00:39:34,515
She said, “Thank God that filth is gone, thank God! Fed up of it!”

534
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:39,820
That’s how when you develop, then
that sweetness, the beauty, everything comes up.

535
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:42,526
But you see the ego is,

536
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:47,022
if you play upon your ego it adheres to you.

537
00:39:47,288 --> 00:39:51,073
You get identified with it, and you cannot get rid of it.

538
00:39:51,237 --> 00:39:54,341
But I have seen one case which is such a beautiful case is,

539
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:00,936
and I was sitting in My room and I could feel with the
child when she came in. And I asked her, “Where is your mother?”

540
00:40:01,126 --> 00:40:05,888
She was herself surprised. When she told her mother.
She said, “I’ve never had such a joy!

541
00:40:06,283 --> 00:40:07,742
Such a joy I had

542
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,887
that, oh, Mother has recognized me.”
I said, “I always recognized you.”

543
00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:16,568
So this is what it is.

544
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:40,586
Yogini: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus...

545
00:40:41,499 --> 00:40:47,273
What she said?
Yogi: You have to speek up. Stand up.
Shri Mataji: Please.

546
00:40:47,432 --> 00:40:52,109
Yogini: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus flower.

547
00:40:52,418 --> 00:40:58,843
Yogi repeats: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus flower

548
00:40:59,364 --> 00:41:09,860
Yogini: At the moment, if the lotus flower,
starting to lose its petals and the fruit developed?

549
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:18,373
Yogi: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus,

550
00:41:18,578 --> 00:41:23,223
and is the lotus at the moment...is the lotus loosing its petals?

551
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:25,754
And the fruit developing.

552
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:34,043
You see, it is represented as lotus
because our brain is like a lotus, actually.

553
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:37,421
If you cut it horizontally you can see

554
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:41,213
as if you have cut the petals,

555
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:45,073
and if you cut it vertically

556
00:41:45,312 --> 00:41:48,100
you can see that around the

557
00:41:48,274 --> 00:41:52,998
around the limbic area it is just like petals of lotus

558
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:58,155
But when you are enlightened
what happens, they swell up and they open out,

559
00:41:58,346 --> 00:42:00,838
and they all have beautiful colors.

560
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:04,306
They look like tongues of flames, it’s very beautiful.

561
00:42:04,704 --> 00:42:07,227
Now the Sahastrara is open

562
00:42:07,498 --> 00:42:09,655
and the lotus is open,

563
00:42:09,775 --> 00:42:14,114
and inside you find the fruit already there kept,

564
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:17,684
which is the Agya Chakra, which sits there.

565
00:42:18,028 --> 00:42:22,369
You can see it very clearly. Agnya is yellow,

566
00:42:23,466 --> 00:42:26,994
yellow-covered as we say,

567
00:42:27,073 --> 00:42:30,530
 like a gold cap

568
00:42:30,655 --> 00:42:34,114
is the Agnya there, beautiful Agnya is inside.

569
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:40,117
Now the fruit of the lotus

570
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:43,853
 is later on we see,

571
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:50,605
and I would say that is called
as Bindu state, where you become a bindu

572
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:54,954
– a dot, it’s a little dot

573
00:42:55,251 --> 00:42:57,536
– and that dot has to then grow.

574
00:42:57,988 --> 00:43:00,416
So it’s the second stage starts

575
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:03,461
when you become the fruit of the lotus.

576
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:17,978
Yogi: Shri Mother, could You say something
about these higher chakras above the Sahasrara?

577
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:19,823
Shri Mataji: What chakra?

578
00:43:20,133 --> 00:43:28,765
Yogi: I heard people talk about Bindu and
Adi Bindu and the higher chakras above that?

579
00:43:29,475 --> 00:43:32,776
You see, I don’t think you should worry too much about these.

580
00:43:33,204 --> 00:43:38,622
These three stages higher than Sahastrara.

581
00:43:39,749 --> 00:43:42,048
I would suggest just now

582
00:43:42,175 --> 00:43:45,654
 let us concentrate on Sahastrara, is a better idea.

583
00:43:46,328 --> 00:43:50,401
But Bindu, Ardha-Bindu and Valaya are the three stages

584
00:43:50,473 --> 00:43:53,323
 in which one has to pass through later on,

585
00:43:53,702 --> 00:43:56,259
and you would pass gradually

586
00:43:56,511 --> 00:43:59,019
when you develop yourself horizontally.

587
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:01,193
That’s what we have started now,

588
00:44:01,328 --> 00:44:06,112
so let us keep to this idea that
we have to develop ourself horizontally.

589
00:44:06,492 --> 00:44:09,608
We should see how we affect

590
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:12,791
the other person,

591
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:15,863
how we influence the another person.

592
00:44:15,983 --> 00:44:20,565
For example some people, you see,
they are very egoistical and all that,

593
00:44:20,716 --> 00:44:26,533
they may come in contact with you
and say, “Oh, very nice person, charming person, this, that.”

594
00:44:26,742 --> 00:44:32,090
But actually that person is just
very physically may be attractive, or

595
00:44:32,214 --> 00:44:38,368
or may be a little brilliant type of person but doesn’t have anything much in it.

596
00:44:38,495 --> 00:44:42,263
But if that person standing next to you, changes

597
00:44:42,529 --> 00:44:45,081
the mood and temperament of another person,

598
00:44:45,324 --> 00:44:49,662
then you can say that this person has a spiritual personality.

599
00:44:50,249 --> 00:44:52,872
So let us see how you affect the nature.

600
00:44:53,034 --> 00:44:54,418
Flowers

601
00:44:54,568 --> 00:44:58,963
– you saw the miracle of the flowers
that I performed for you  the other day.

602
00:44:59,467 --> 00:45:01,038
In the same way

603
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:05,294
let us see what is the effect of your character on the

604
00:45:05,694 --> 00:45:09,466
on the trees, on your friends,

605
00:45:09,566 --> 00:45:11,921
or in the food that you make – everything

606
00:45:11,978 --> 00:45:13,986
everything changes, it’s very beautiful.

607
00:45:14,184 --> 00:45:17,070
So we have to see that, how it works out.

608
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:22,110
I have known people who have never known
what is poetry is, suddenly they become poets.

609
00:45:22,378 --> 00:45:25,320
Some who were never musicians started singing so well.

610
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:27,185
Like Christine, you know Christine,

611
00:45:27,275 --> 00:45:29,950
she never used to sing, she had a horrible voice.

612
00:45:30,172 --> 00:45:34,628
And suddenly she started singing like a cuckoo-bird!

613
00:45:37,722 --> 00:45:43,077
So not only you, but on others
what effect is had? What others feel about you?

614
00:45:43,248 --> 00:45:45,064
You see, how you are kind,

615
00:45:45,157 --> 00:45:49,725
good and sweet to others, not superficially,

616
00:45:49,906 --> 00:45:53,522
but your behavior should change another person,

617
00:45:53,967 --> 00:45:55,898
transform another person.

618
00:45:55,959 --> 00:46:00,266
Your presence should bring auspiciousness.

619
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:33,093
[Yogi: Shri Mataji, how can we develop
that same heart that poets like Kabir have for You?]

620
00:46:33,429 --> 00:46:37,487
Shri Mataji: Same heart as what? - Yogi: Kabir, like Kabir.

621
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:39,875
Why not?

622
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:44,525
See the handicap of Kabir.

623
00:46:45,445 --> 00:46:47,445
You have no handicaps.

624
00:46:48,023 --> 00:46:51,937
Kabir had no Mother to tell him, no Mother to love him,

625
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,134
look after him and tell him all these things.

626
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:59,412
He had a guru, if you know Kabir’s life.

627
00:46:59,665 --> 00:47:07,295
Kabir wanted to become the disciple of Ramananda Swami,

628
00:47:07,643 --> 00:47:11,556
but he was a Muslim or low-caste or whatever it is,

629
00:47:11,945 --> 00:47:15,385
so he could not  reach Ramanand Swami.

630
00:47:15,526 --> 00:47:19,778
The disciples would not allow him to go near Ramanand Swami.

631
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:28,076
So one day Kabira went and slept on the

632
00:47:29,015 --> 00:47:34,807
steps of the River Ganges, all night in the cold

633
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:37,972
waiting for Ramanand Swami to come,

634
00:47:38,163 --> 00:47:41,215
because he used to always pass the same way.

635
00:47:41,501 --> 00:47:46,101
And his feet fell on Kabira

636
00:47:46,492 --> 00:47:50,317
and he said, “Oh my child, what are you doing here?”

637
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:56,454
So Kabira got up and he said, “Sir,
you have accepted me as your disciple today.”

638
00:47:56,454 --> 00:47:58,026
He said, “Yes, I have.”

639
00:47:58,101 --> 00:48:02,037
And then Ramanand Swami took him and he

640
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,278
trained him into something great.

641
00:48:04,462 --> 00:48:07,048
You don’t have these handicaps,

642
00:48:07,448 --> 00:48:12,039
where Kabira never had anybody to support him or help him around.

643
00:48:12,225 --> 00:48:15,573
Actually single-handed he fought the whole world.

644
00:48:17,143 --> 00:48:21,814
Horrible people were around him; even today those who are

645
00:48:22,496 --> 00:48:27,928
in his place in Patna on all places where he lived

646
00:48:28,097 --> 00:48:32,464
– I was self surprised that he described Kundalini as “surathi”

647
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:35,004
and they described tobacco as “surathi.”

648
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:39,210
Such horrible nonsensical people, making fun of everything.

649
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:42,602
There Kabira lived and developed that heart.

650
00:48:42,701 --> 00:48:46,407
You don’t have all these handicaps, at all.

651
00:48:46,736 --> 00:48:51,206
You all speak the same language, you live with the same ideas,

652
00:48:51,371 --> 00:48:54,929
you have your own Mother to tell you everything,

653
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:59,961
so you can develop the same heart as Kabira had.

654
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:12,403
Yogi: Mother, when I meditate sometimes I can see beautiful,

655
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:24,832
like a massive flower coming out of the head or a beautiful,
sort of a golden like, almost like a vase.

656
00:49:25,116 --> 00:49:34,923
And I’ve been asking people, and they don’t know
really the answer, and I don’t know it either.

657
00:49:35,246 --> 00:49:38,238
That’s the Kundalini that you see.

658
00:49:38,414 --> 00:49:40,430
It is like a telescope, you see

659
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:48,638
like a goldenish, yellowish sort of a, like a heated, like iron...

660
00:49:48,836 --> 00:49:50,337
Yogi: It’s like a furnace.

661
00:49:50,543 --> 00:49:53,639
Yes, furnace, it’s like a furnace. That’s the Kundalini you see,

662
00:49:53,774 --> 00:49:57,115
and that’s a good thing to see. But when you see you are not there,

663
00:49:57,288 --> 00:50:02,470
so it’s better is not to see that. But what you see is that,

664
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:05,658
is the Kundalini. It’s good, I mean seeing is very good,

665
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,375
but to go beyond it. Say,
“No, I don’t want to see it. Now I want to enter into it.”

666
00:50:10,571 --> 00:50:16,353
Yogi: Yes. Last night for instance
I was sleeping with my little girl,

667
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:24,721
and in her bed she asked me to come. And we meditated,
and it was enormous and I woke up, suddenly woke up.

668
00:50:24,966 --> 00:50:26,482
In your dream you saw?

669
00:50:26,668 --> 00:50:30,574
Yogi: I don’t know whether it was a dream or
whether I was still meditating, but ….

670
00:50:30,749 --> 00:50:32,598
In dream if you see is very good,

671
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:37,362
but otherwise in meditation you should not see it.
In the dream if you see, is very good.

672
00:50:37,553 --> 00:50:42,384
It’s the Kundalini itself, it’s like a furnace,
it looks like a silent burning furnace.

673
00:50:42,514 --> 00:50:46,068
Yogi: Sometimes like fireworks. It’s quite beautiful.

674
00:50:46,384 --> 00:50:53,032
Yes. But you shouldn’t see it
anymore, all right? Try to avoid.

675
00:50:54,863 --> 00:50:59,474
Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You just say
something about how we pure attention?

676
00:50:59,696 --> 00:51:03,699
Shri Mataji: Pure?
Yogi: Pure attention, how we purify the attention.

677
00:51:03,859 --> 00:51:08,651
How we look beyond the human form
and the differences between each other?

678
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:11,251
Pure attention?

679
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:18,645
You see, your attention gets spoilt
that when you put attention – say I put attention onto this glass,

680
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:23,149
then I start thinking about this glass that
“Oh, it’s a beautiful glass so now,

681
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:25,990
so it’s a very beautifully done one.

682
00:51:26,201 --> 00:51:30,351
Now somehow or other I should manage to steal it!”

683
00:51:43,399 --> 00:51:50,735
Then attention moves further, “How can I manage to steal this?

684
00:51:51,781 --> 00:51:55,506
And what should I do, what is the best way of stealing it?”

685
00:51:55,648 --> 00:52:01,739
and all those things. So the attention gives,
you see, into problems and problems because I have got

686
00:52:01,921 --> 00:52:05,423
for this a greed, I develop a greed.

687
00:52:05,534 --> 00:52:09,794
 How I’ve developed? Because you see, supposing

688
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:15,578
I put My attention to it and then a thought
starts from there coming to Me,

689
00:52:15,681 --> 00:52:18,813
 a reaction as such, this gives you a reaction.

690
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:21,830
Then you start seeing a beautiful Ganesha there,

691
00:52:21,902 --> 00:52:24,552
then you say, “Oh, I have never seen one like this!”

692
00:52:24,647 --> 00:52:27,555
Like that the thought starts, you see,coming from all this.

693
00:52:27,662 --> 00:52:30,233
And that thought comes into My mind

694
00:52:30,282 --> 00:52:33,842
and gives Me ideas that I should do something like that,

695
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:35,837
to steal the glass. All right?

696
00:52:35,977 --> 00:52:40,977
Now, the pure attention would be
that I just watch this without thinking.

697
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:47,016
Anywhere that your attention goes and you start sort of

698
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:52,185
getting involved into it or getting attached to it,

699
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:57,150
you should try to just watch it without thinking.

700
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,567
Go into thoughtless awareness, then you enjoy it the most.

701
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:04,480
Now say for example, these carpets are very nice.

702
00:53:04,837 --> 00:53:09,873
One thing would be, if they belonged to Me
I would be worried how to insure them

703
00:53:09,956 --> 00:53:15,121
all these people aresitting, that would be spoilt, this, hat –
all these thoughts will come into My head.

704
00:53:15,324 --> 00:53:19,714
Supposing these belonged to you, then I’ll think how to manage to

705
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:24,192
take them with Me somehow,

706
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:37,667
and how to suggest in a very clever way
something that I can manage to take them away!

707
00:53:39,271 --> 00:53:43,882
Now that is quite human and one can do that way,

708
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:49,133
but beyond that all cleverness and cunning,

709
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,946
best is to appreciate.

710
00:53:52,121 --> 00:53:55,845
How? By just looking at it without any thought.

711
00:53:56,201 --> 00:54:01,718
Artist has created it, he has put all
his joy into it. I’m just enjoying the joy,

712
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,530
just looking at it.

713
00:54:03,655 --> 00:54:10,666
So when you start enjoying the joy
your attention will become pure, very pure.

714
00:54:11,073 --> 00:54:14,813
Because the enjoyment of it is, this makes you

715
00:54:14,901 --> 00:54:19,905
a very sort of a dedicated person about it,

716
00:54:20,108 --> 00:54:23,693
because you feel that what is in this world after all?

717
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:29,491
It’s to enjoy. And if I have to enjoy
everything, then why should I worry

718
00:54:29,675 --> 00:54:38,541
about getting it to Myself or stealing it,
or doing all these tricks? Better is to enjoy.

719
00:54:39,886 --> 00:54:46,163
So the reward of it is so great
that attention starts purifying itself.

720
00:54:47,614 --> 00:54:52,482
[Yogi: We tend to sort of react to
things before we even know that we’ve reacted.

721
00:54:52,614 --> 00:54:56,880
It seems to be such a fast process
that we look and we react in seconds.]

722
00:54:57,465 --> 00:55:03,282
Yes, in the beginning it is,
because you are coming from that, you see, style

723
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:08,675
to the other style.
But once you settle in this style, then you’ll just react

724
00:55:08,904 --> 00:55:11,753
in this manner that you’ll just watch.

725
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:15,341
But it otherwise also works out. I’ll tell you a story.

726
00:55:15,735 --> 00:55:22,526
They had given Me about sixteen
beautiful crowns – of course I couldn’t wear them

727
00:55:22,709 --> 00:55:28,184
– for this Krishna Puja in Switzerland, and

728
00:55:28,933 --> 00:55:33,674
all the English were bringing them, “smuggling” them into England,

729
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:36,966
and all these boxes were kept.

730
00:55:37,331 --> 00:55:39,355
So when they reached the custom

731
00:55:39,447 --> 00:55:44,523
post, the custom post asked them,
“What are all these?” They said, “All right, you can have a look."

732
00:55:44,784 --> 00:55:46,831
So they passed on one to them.

733
00:55:46,983 --> 00:55:51,058
So the first fellow looked at it and then he passed to another one,

734
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:57,500
then another one given. Like that
four were passed on to them, and they were all looking at it.

735
00:55:57,751 --> 00:56:02,729
And then they said, “Now what do you say?”
Nothing. They closed it and gave it to them.

736
00:56:03,912 --> 00:56:09,660
Then they looked back – these boys,
what has happened to them where they were?

737
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:13,294
They just were moving like this.

738
00:56:13,526 --> 00:56:18,295
And so many cars passed but these people
never looked at any cars, they were just ….

739
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:22,858
So they had a bliss casualty

740
00:56:30,504 --> 00:56:34,282
– also this can happen, bliss casualty!

741
00:56:41,228 --> 00:56:46,311
So better to see things which can cause bliss casualty!

742
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:52,808
And once you get into that habit,
then you don’t take to other useless things.

743
00:56:53,226 --> 00:56:57,805
Then you like to see only things which can give you bliss.

744
00:56:58,491 --> 00:57:00,594
Your attention changes.

745
00:57:04,062 --> 00:57:07,514
Yogi: Mother, please, what is the Aumkara?

746
00:57:07,942 --> 00:57:09,416
The Aumkara?

747
00:57:09,758 --> 00:57:11,567
Is the first sound.

748
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:21,032
When the Shakti departed from Sadashiva,

749
00:57:21,476 --> 00:57:25,472
from the God Almighty – His Power, His Desire

750
00:57:25,731 --> 00:57:28,207
departed – it made the first sound:

751
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:31,692
that’s the first Child, we say, of God.

752
00:57:32,405 --> 00:57:35,405
That’s Aumkara. A-U-M is the thing,

753
00:57:35,754 --> 00:57:40,804
and these are the three Powers which are represented

754
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:46,152
as Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

755
00:57:46,554 --> 00:57:53,475
And also all these are combined together to form Shri Ganesh.

756
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:01,648
Yogi: Mother, what is Your vision for Sahaja Yoga?

757
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:08,003
Shri Mataji: What is the…?
Yogi: What is Your vision for Sahaja Yoga?

758
00:58:11,453 --> 00:58:15,135
This is the one, started already!

759
00:58:16,466 --> 00:58:20,616
My vision for Sahaja Yoga is that, that

760
00:58:21,816 --> 00:58:25,152
all the good people, righteous people,

761
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:28,371
God-loving people

762
00:58:28,759 --> 00:58:34,823
will rise above all that is useless, worldly,

763
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:39,912
and reside in the Heavens

764
00:58:40,124 --> 00:58:45,764
with all the blessings of God, for ever and ever.

765
00:58:53,959 --> 00:58:54,959
All right?

766
00:58:55,475 --> 00:59:00,165
So we can have a music,
because without that you won’t feel it is complete.

767
00:59:02,495 --> 00:59:05,765
Let’s hear the song …

768
01:00:55,544 --> 01:01:00,361
Did you hear the tape from Pune children?

769
01:01:00,787 --> 01:01:04,286
Wasn’t it fine? Very good, isn’t it?

770
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:08,636
