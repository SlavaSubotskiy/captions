1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,715
Today, we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:17,138
It's a very opportune time today, I feel,

3
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:22,681
where the innocence, especially

4
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:29,514
in the European and American countries,

5
00:00:29,715 --> 00:00:32,553
is under attack.

6
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:37,132
There's no respect of the innocence,

7
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:41,798
no value for the innocence.

8
00:00:43,132 --> 00:00:45,923
They don't understand how important

9
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:50,298
it is for human life

10
00:00:51,132 --> 00:00:54,756
to have innocence

11
00:00:55,756 --> 00:01:01,173
being respected within themselves and also without.

12
00:01:03,256 --> 00:01:08,007
The human life is different from that of animal life.

13
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:13,298
Animals are controlled all the time, or we can say

14
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:18,590
they are under a complete imprisonment, you can say

15
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:24,590
under the will of Lord Sadashiva.

16
00:01:25,339 --> 00:01:28,464
That's why He's called as Pashupati.

17
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:35,423
But human beings have been given freedom

18
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:40,840
to choose their ascent, to choose the right,

19
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:43,298
to choose the truth.

20
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:47,548
Only through innocence they can achieve that.

21
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:50,696
Can you remove this one from here because

22
00:01:50,897 --> 00:01:53,439
people can't see Me I think.

23
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,339
It's all right.

24
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:13,132
Only the innocence is the source of joy.

25
00:02:14,798 --> 00:02:18,756
Without innocence you cannot enjoy anything fully.

26
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:25,673
This innocence is today completely under challenge

27
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:29,965
and to finish the innocence,

28
00:02:30,548 --> 00:02:32,882
in a very subtle way

29
00:02:33,423 --> 00:02:36,673
there are very negative, cruel,

30
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:40,673
criminal type of people who are working it out.

31
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:45,132
Their minds, if you say “possessed,” it doesn't look like that

32
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:50,631
because otherwise they are quite intelligent.

33
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:55,339
They are also, in a way,

34
00:02:55,548 --> 00:02:59,381
creative of horrible things.

35
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:03,256
So you can't say they are not intelligent,

36
00:03:05,423 --> 00:03:08,882
but from where do they get this knowledge

37
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:12,464
of creating something so horrifying?

38
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:22,715
In this Kali Yuga, as in Sahaja Yoga,

39
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,882
everybody can take birth. There's freedom.

40
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:32,882
It was not before so much so

41
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,423
that all kinds of evil people have taken

42
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:40,548
birth on this earth.

43
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,715
These evil people generate

44
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:51,965
evil thoughts and people catch them and get moving with it.

45
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:55,673
Even a good person can get swayed by it.

46
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:59,173
Even a saint can get swayed by it.

47
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:03,923
So these forces of evil,

48
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:08,965
the forces which are working out today,

49
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:13,132
are coming basically from these horrible people.

50
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:17,882
Firstly, they might have come as false gurus,

51
00:04:18,923 --> 00:04:22,798
teaching something nonsensical,

52
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:25,256
like Rajneesh.

53
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:29,381
Then from some philosophers like Freud,

54
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:34,548
who is still accepted in some countries as a great philosopher,

55
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:42,798
and still some psychologists worship him as God.

56
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:49,048
This Freudian knowledge was accepted

57
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:53,506
without even thinking why Freud did that.

58
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:58,007
Freud was a Jew,

59
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:03,715
and he found that many Christians tortured the Jews in America.

60
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:08,090
This is another anti Christ activity.

61
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:11,298
And when they tortured the Jews,

62
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:16,048
this fellow thought that better to make them immoral,

63
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:18,173
destroy their innocence.

64
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:21,173
I don't know if he could understand to that point,

65
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,840
and he started theories which were so shocking

66
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:33,132
that normally any sensible person would never have accepted it.

67
00:05:33,882 --> 00:05:38,631
But so many people accepted in America to begin with.

68
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,423
In America,

69
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:44,132
people take to anything very easily which is absurd,

70
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:46,132
which is stupid; I don't know why.

71
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:48,840
They have a special liking for such things.

72
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,756
If Freud had come to India,

73
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:53,935
they would have cut him into a hundred pieces, I tell you,

74
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:56,097
and thrown in the Arabic Sea.

75
00:05:56,298 --> 00:05:58,464
They could not have born this idea,

76
00:05:58,673 --> 00:06:03,464
the way he had insulted the mother and her love for her child,

77
00:06:03,673 --> 00:06:05,923
the purity of her love.

78
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:11,464
But Jews did not accept him, surprisingly.

79
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:13,423
Jews did not accept.

80
00:06:13,631 --> 00:06:18,840
It's the Christians who accepted his ideas and started destroying,

81
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:21,923
displeasing Shri Ganesh.

82
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:26,173
First of all,

83
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:29,965
we have to understand we are born in a very precarious,

84
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:32,548
dangerous times.

85
00:06:33,798 --> 00:06:36,631
At the time of Christ there were very few people

86
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,764
who followed him and they didn't understand much about Kundalini either.

87
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:42,923
They had no knowledge.

88
00:06:43,464 --> 00:06:45,756
They had no knowledge that Christ

89
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:48,590
was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

90
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,090
But in the Christian countries only you find

91
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:55,673
the insult of Christ, the insult of innocence

92
00:06:56,007 --> 00:07:00,090
openly done, sometimes legally accepted.

93
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:05,132
So when we are born under such horrible circumstances,

94
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:07,506
we have to build up

95
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:10,464
a great force, ourselves,

96
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,631
of spirituality.

97
00:07:13,882 --> 00:07:15,798
When I came today,

98
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:19,673
there was no breeze, no leaf was moving,

99
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:23,506
but you were singing songs and tremendous breeze was coming

100
00:07:23,715 --> 00:07:26,798
from you all, and that made Me understand

101
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:30,882
that this Divine force has come into being.

102
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:33,548
It is there.

103
00:07:34,548 --> 00:07:38,840
It's working. Not only that, but it’s very powerful.

104
00:07:39,882 --> 00:07:44,132
Normally, breeze doesn't come to Me, it goes the other way around.

105
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,007
But it was such a tremendous breeze

106
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:49,548
that I had to hold somebody's hand.

107
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:52,590
And not a leaf was moving.

108
00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:56,756
So this collective force that you have,

109
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:59,298
you must remember you have to fight it,

110
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:03,298
not to run away. Don't escape it.

111
00:08:04,673 --> 00:08:06,548
You have to fight it

112
00:08:06,756 --> 00:08:10,840
and you have to prove that innocence is to be respected.

113
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:25,381
Adi Shakti first made Shri Ganesh.

114
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:28,339
It was the first

115
00:08:28,756 --> 00:08:31,339
deity was created. Why?

116
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,256
Because She wanted to fill

117
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:39,798
the whole atmosphere with Chaitanya,

118
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,214
with holiness, with auspiciousness.

119
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:46,715
It is still there.

120
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:49,464
It's still everywhere you can feel

121
00:08:49,673 --> 00:08:53,548
Chaitanya is working, but

122
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:58,339
it does not penetrate into the

123
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:03,048
modern minds because modern mind

124
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:06,339
doesn't know what this innocence is.

125
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,590
They have no idea at all about innocence.

126
00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:14,590
The way they are going on

127
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:20,339
everywhere, is really something never happened on this earth.

128
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,756
So with the innocence comes moral life.

129
00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:34,423
Morality is the expression of innocence.

130
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:43,339
Innocence

131
00:09:43,923 --> 00:09:49,464
shows a person that he's incapable of being immoral.

132
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,548
Once I had gone to visit a ship.

133
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:55,994
I was coming out in the Customs.

134
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,236
When I was coming in the Customs

135
00:09:58,437 --> 00:10:00,814
they said, "Did you get anything from the ship?"

136
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:02,514
I said, "Yes, of course."

137
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:05,423
So they were shocked, you know , "What did you get?"

138
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:07,214
"Some cheese."

139
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:08,590
"And?"

140
00:10:08,798 --> 00:10:12,840
"And we ate also, and we have some cheese with us.”

141
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:14,298
"What else?"

142
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,256
"Some books."

143
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:18,256
"Books?

144
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,090
You are not supposed to get any books from there."

145
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:22,756
I said, "Why not?"

146
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:25,173
He said, “You have to pay Customs."

147
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:30,214
I said, “All right, how much do we have to pay Customs?"

148
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:33,673
“You didn't read any rule about it?”  I said, “No.”

149
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,214
I was innocent.  I never read anything

150
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:39,381
that you have to pay money for books also.

151
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,756
He said, “No, no you are joking. Go."

152
00:10:43,464 --> 00:10:45,631
They thought this woman is so simple,

153
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:49,860
She doesn't, I was the wife of the Chairman of Shipping Corporation,

154
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:51,519
going in a very big car,

155
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,387
and they couldn't understand this woman is so simple that

156
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,713
She's saying She has taken some cheese

157
00:10:56,914 --> 00:10:59,331
and She has taken some books.

158
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:04,506
All these laws and regulations

159
00:11:04,756 --> 00:11:07,381
people bind they have also come

160
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:11,132
from our idea of Dharma.

161
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,339
But the root of Dharma is innocence.

162
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:20,007
All laws are made

163
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,423
to protect the innocent.

164
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:26,548
Not to punish

165
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:31,173
only the criminals but to protect the innocent person.

166
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:35,132
So if somebody is proved to be innocent,

167
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:40,132
your innocence protects you.

168
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:43,506
I have seen many a times in My life,

169
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:47,965
because I'm so simple, I should say,

170
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:53,007
that I had no problem, never, of anything.

171
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,048
This is a kind of

172
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:02,882
a very powerful vibrations

173
00:12:03,298 --> 00:12:05,673
that come from an innocent person,

174
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,214
like from small children.

175
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,339
Small children, if you see their vibrations,

176
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:16,339
hundreds grown up Sahaja Yogis may not have

177
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,756
the vibrations of a little one, I can tell you this much.

178
00:12:19,965 --> 00:12:22,673
But once they start growing,

179
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:27,381
then they become very intelligent,

180
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:31,090
very grown up, matured,

181
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:36,965
and as if they have lost their innocence.

182
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:41,173
This is no growth according to Me.

183
00:12:41,715 --> 00:12:45,506
According to Me this is the death of innocence.

184
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:49,007
To be cunning, to be clever,

185
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:53,381
to be very intelligent, so called,

186
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:56,756
it is very self-deceptive.

187
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:05,173
For that, there is one blessing also.

188
00:13:06,423 --> 00:13:09,464
All those who have

189
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,882
committed such mistakes

190
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:17,631
have to ask forgiveness from Sadashiva

191
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:20,673
or from the Adi Shakti.

192
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:24,423
But Ganesha doesn't forgive.

193
00:13:25,798 --> 00:13:29,381
That is one thing wrong with Him: He doesn't forgive.

194
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:34,007
If you have hurt Him, He'll hit you back.

195
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:38,381
As a result now, we have diseases like AIDS,

196
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:40,923
all other horrible diseases that you have

197
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:43,965
which are called as secret diseases.

198
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:48,381
They are all because of the wrath of Shri Ganesh.

199
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:51,673
Immoral life that people have been leading

200
00:13:51,923 --> 00:13:54,173
as if they have a permission

201
00:13:54,548 --> 00:13:57,381
from God Almighty to do what they like.

202
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:03,048
People are so proud, such vanity,

203
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:07,173
that they think whatever they do, after all, what,

204
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840
nothing can happen to them.

205
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:13,214
And with all these things happening in this world,

206
00:14:13,464 --> 00:14:16,590
people are still taking to immorality,

207
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:19,132
very openly,

208
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:22,298
boastfully.

209
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:27,256
And I've seen that people who are elite, I have till now,

210
00:14:27,506 --> 00:14:29,298
been in the elite people.

211
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:33,715
They crack such dirty jokes and they are so

212
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:37,423
overly smart that you just can't bear their company.

213
00:14:37,923 --> 00:14:41,132
They are worse than the loafers on the street sometimes.

214
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,132
So this disease has spread,

215
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:50,214
spread among older people more than among younger people,

216
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:53,007
among children.

217
00:14:53,173 --> 00:14:58,464
So I think the people are now jealous of the little children.

218
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,506
Otherwise, why should they attack

219
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:03,756
younger children? What do they get out of them?

220
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:08,840
In this jealous attitude

221
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:12,923
they try to attack in a very dirty, funny manner.

222
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,423
Then Shri Ganesh,

223
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:18,673
He will never forgive these people -

224
00:15:18,882 --> 00:15:21,381
never, never, never.

225
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,756
First of all, He'll expose them,

226
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,506
and He will punish them for seven lives.

227
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:32,715
Seven lives their families will be cursed,

228
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,798
and seven lives they, themselves, will be cursed.

229
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:39,923
That is His commandment.

230
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:42,756
But if His Mother says, "All right, forgive",

231
00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:46,173
or the father says, "All right, forgive", He obeys.

232
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:50,048
He obeys His Mother absolutely.

233
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,214
Never questions, never questions,

234
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,631
never answers back.

235
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:03,007
Whatever He’s told,

236
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:08,132
though He's in command of all the Ganas, He's  Ganadheesha,

237
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:13,631
but before His Mother, He's just like a little baby.

238
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,256
He doesn't challenge the Mother.

239
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:22,007
Even if the Mother tries to test Him

240
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:27,132
or tries to get puzzled,

241
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,548
He never doubt Her.

242
00:16:32,464 --> 00:16:35,631
In Her Maya He cannot fall.

243
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:40,631
He cannot fall into Her Maya because He's so innocent.

244
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:46,256
He's like a churned out butter, out of the buttermilk.

245
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,339
So this butter can never get dissolved back.

246
00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:54,798
In the same way, this child,

247
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,298
which is pure innocence,

248
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:01,840
never can be contaminated

249
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:05,090
by the Maya of the Mother.

250
00:17:05,298 --> 00:17:10,381
Maya is the process by which you test people.

251
00:17:10,923 --> 00:17:12,965
You have to test them.

252
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,923
See, these days people are so clever, so intelligent,

253
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:20,840
that it is beyond even Adi Shakti, beyond any Shakti,

254
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:23,923
the way they try to cheat you.

255
00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:26,090
So many have cheated Me,

256
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:28,673
but they are back in their seats again.

257
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:32,048
That's done not by Me, but by Shri Ganesha.

258
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:34,840
He's just standing on all the sides.

259
00:17:35,048 --> 00:17:37,464
If you try to do anything like that,

260
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:40,673
He'll hit you hard - I can't help it.

261
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:44,090
Now, this one came on this earth

262
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:48,256
as our Lord Jesus Christ.

263
00:17:49,304 --> 00:17:52,971
Christ, I think, is more active than Shri Ganesha

264
00:17:53,182 --> 00:17:57,221
because Shri Ganesha is fat, He has a big belly,

265
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:59,673
I think He takes time to hit you.

266
00:17:59,882 --> 00:18:02,173
But this Christ,

267
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,882
I don't know how He has hit people.

268
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:09,798
All over the world there are diseases, diseases, diseases.

269
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:14,506
He has killed so many people.

270
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:18,673
He's the one who used to ask for forgiveness

271
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,465
for the people who killed him.

272
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:24,882
But He is so active, I have seen,

273
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,506
that sometimes I tell people,

274
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:30,590
don't talk ill of Me, its very dangerous.

275
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:33,298
Don't talk against Me.

276
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:36,923
In a very secret manner He exists

277
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,048
and the way He hits people is sometimes -

278
00:18:41,256 --> 00:18:46,298
it's dangerous. Even My eyes get filled up with tears.

279
00:18:46,715 --> 00:18:48,964
So I have to control both sides.

280
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:54,590
One is Shri Ganesha, another side is Christ.

281
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,923
There are two other people,

282
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:03,381
Saint Michael and Gabriel.

283
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:07,298
We call them

284
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:11,423
in Sanskrit language

285
00:19:11,632 --> 00:19:14,548
as Bhairava and Hanumana,

286
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:18,757
and they incarnated as

287
00:19:20,256 --> 00:19:24,048
Buddha - Mahavira and Buddha.

288
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:30,048
And the Buddhists are really, I tell you,

289
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:34,298
are another kind of  perverts.

290
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:38,381
It was said, Buddha said

291
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,298
that you should not get attached to anything;

292
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:44,381
you shouldn't get attached to your money,

293
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:50,048
to your wealth, to your family, to anything.

294
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:03,173
That time,

295
00:20:03,381 --> 00:20:06,923
the attachment was very great, must have been,

296
00:20:07,882 --> 00:20:11,381
and this attachment he wanted them to

297
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,465
remove from the minds of the people.

298
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,673
You cannot.

299
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,673
By removing your clothes,

300
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:21,964
by wearing those saffron clothes,

301
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:26,048
by shaving your heads, by walking bare feet,

302
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:29,923
by torturing your body, you cannot.

303
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:32,757
That's all outside.

304
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:37,131
That's not real detachment. That's not Buddha at all.

305
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,882
Neither Christ, nor Mahavira.

306
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:46,757
What they said that you should get detached from within.

307
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:51,923
To get detached from within is very different

308
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:56,506
than to get detached from outside.

309
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:02,923
It's not how much you starve that you become Christ,

310
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:09,048
or whether you move like Mahavira,

311
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:12,882
that you become like Him,

312
00:21:14,131 --> 00:21:18,506
or you get saffron clothes

313
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:21,548
like Buddha, you become Buddha.

314
00:21:21,757 --> 00:21:25,173
So what a misconception they have

315
00:21:25,381 --> 00:21:29,423
of whatever was taught to people.

316
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:34,089
That was the time when it was the days of tapasya,

317
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:38,882
of penance, and that's why they said to do penance

318
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,423
is best is to get rid of all these things

319
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:46,506
so you will develop deeper into your being.

320
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:51,131
Even in the Christian religion they started

321
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,048
these nuns and these, what you call them,

322
00:21:54,256 --> 00:21:56,798
the fathers and the mothers and the nuns,

323
00:21:56,964 --> 00:21:59,381
and all kinds of things.

324
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,298
This is another artificial thing they started.

325
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:08,590
By doing this, do you think you can become innocent?

326
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:14,673
I have known nuns who are so horrible

327
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:16,882
that you can't even look at them,

328
00:22:17,048 --> 00:22:19,673
they emit nothing but heat.

329
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:23,882
And those priests, now you have heard about them,

330
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:29,048
the way they are attacking the innocence of people.

331
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:35,715
Buddhists are the worst, I should say, because

332
00:22:40,673 --> 00:22:44,632
they say, “Renounce, renounce everything.”

333
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,006
All right, renounce and beg.

334
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:54,381
So you renounce everything and beg for gold.

335
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,715
What do you say to this kind of a contradiction?

336
00:22:57,882 --> 00:23:01,923
And we have there, like Dalai Lama,

337
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:05,632
he is a universal beggar

338
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:08,006
and people like it.

339
00:23:08,214 --> 00:23:09,840
People like if somebody is begging

340
00:23:10,006 --> 00:23:13,131
because their ego is pampered.

341
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,673
Like he went to Los Angeles

342
00:23:15,882 --> 00:23:18,882
and all the actors and actresses had a very, very

343
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:20,757
big conference and thought

344
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:23,465
that by giving alms to this beggar

345
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:26,882
their innocence will come back.

346
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,632
Can you believe such a story?

347
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,006
Any sensible people has to understand,

348
00:23:32,214 --> 00:23:35,923
that by giving alms, how can your innocence come back?

349
00:23:37,423 --> 00:23:40,298
And so this fellow was again given lot of alms.

350
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:43,089
He's got lot of gold and he's really

351
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:48,214
a goldy man, all the time collecting gold

352
00:23:48,423 --> 00:23:51,757
from here and gold from there and gold from you.

353
00:23:55,173 --> 00:23:59,214
Such people, incarnations, who came just to

354
00:23:59,548 --> 00:24:04,506
tell us to be detached, just to develop morality.

355
00:24:05,173 --> 00:24:09,173
If you are detached about your sex life,

356
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:13,882
if you are detached about your financial side,

357
00:24:14,131 --> 00:24:17,506
if you are detached even from your country,

358
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:20,131
then a detached personality of that kind

359
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,506
will become innocent and there will be no quarrel.

360
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,882
But it's happening the other way around now.

361
00:24:33,548 --> 00:24:35,548
Same in the Islam.

362
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:40,590
Whatever was taught in the Islam is taken on the other side.

363
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,131
It cannot be in any way

364
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,882
where Mohammed Sahib was only insisting on morality.

365
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,048
Any kind of immoral behavior He didn't want to have.

366
00:24:53,256 --> 00:24:55,923
He did say, at that time, you can marry more women

367
00:24:56,131 --> 00:24:57,964
because there were more women,

368
00:24:58,173 --> 00:25:01,964
but He never said you become prostitutes,

369
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,423
you lead a life of sin.

370
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,423
That was just a Samayachar, that was only

371
00:25:10,632 --> 00:25:13,882
that time, that was the problem. He said,   “All right.”

372
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:16,882
For example, divorce was not allowed at that time,

373
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:19,882
but in Sahaja Yoga we do allow divorce.

374
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:23,089
But I have seen that without divorce

375
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:26,964
they can't live, I mean, just an impossible situation

376
00:25:27,173 --> 00:25:29,798
because also women sometimes

377
00:25:30,006 --> 00:25:33,548
are extremely, extremely cruel

378
00:25:33,757 --> 00:25:37,340
and men sometimes are extremely peevish.

379
00:25:37,548 --> 00:25:41,715
Under these circumstances, how can they be companions?

380
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:47,423
More women are immoral in this matter, I should say.

381
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,048
First, it was the men who used to do immorality,

382
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,882
but now the women who are not only innocence,

383
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:56,673
but also Shakti,

384
00:25:57,131 --> 00:26:00,548
are trying to get into

385
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,340
some sort of a shamelessness.

386
00:26:05,173 --> 00:26:10,048
No care of their own innocence.

387
00:26:10,715 --> 00:26:13,381
Their innocence is the Shakti.

388
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,632
If a woman is not innocent, how can she have Shakti?

389
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:22,590
If she is leading an immoral life,

390
00:26:22,923 --> 00:26:26,298
then her Shakti will be finished.

391
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:31,173
Only her morality is her Shri Ganesha

392
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:36,256
which emits this purity in her.

393
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:43,465
Now, I feel that

394
00:26:44,465 --> 00:26:47,964
the way people are pumping our heads with ideas,

395
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,673
especially from Hollywood,

396
00:26:50,882 --> 00:26:52,964
we accept them

397
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,840
and we forget that we are just hurting Shri Ganesha

398
00:26:58,048 --> 00:27:00,840
and He'll come back on us.

399
00:27:02,465 --> 00:27:05,381
It starts at a very low level

400
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:09,048
when we start hating our children.

401
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:15,214
The problem starts when we don't understand our children.

402
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,840
I mean, in England they say that two children are killed

403
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:24,256
every week by parents.

404
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:32,632
This kind of attitude towards children.

405
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:36,131
First of all, they should not produce;

406
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,089
if they have produced then they are Shri Ganeshas.

407
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:41,048
They have to respect,

408
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:45,173
they have to love, and they have to encourage.

409
00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:47,757
But to spoil the children is also

410
00:27:47,923 --> 00:27:51,173
another kind of negative force, I think.

411
00:27:51,423 --> 00:27:54,590
Some people spoil their children.

412
00:27:56,298 --> 00:27:59,423
Ganesha can never be spoiled.

413
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:04,381
You cannot spoil Him, because He is beyond Maya.

414
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:08,548
But the way people run after their children sometimes

415
00:28:08,757 --> 00:28:09,964
is shocking.

416
00:28:10,173 --> 00:28:13,882
To them, that is the greatest achievement they have got,

417
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:15,673
that they have a child.

418
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:18,381
Even in a place like India

419
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,590
where it's an over population,

420
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:24,632
to them their children are like,

421
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,882
I don't know what, so attached.

422
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:31,590
So this is a new attachment that has started

423
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:38,173
which also gives you a kind of an immoral life,

424
00:28:41,256 --> 00:28:44,214
because you are Sahaja Yogis.

425
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:47,340
For people who are Sahaja Yogis,

426
00:28:47,548 --> 00:28:50,757
all the children of the world are their own,

427
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,632
not only your own children whom you love.

428
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:59,102
All of them are Shri Ganeshas.

429
00:28:59,263 --> 00:29:02,214
Of course, if there's somebody who is not a good child

430
00:29:02,423 --> 00:29:05,840
or you find it difficult, its all right,

431
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:09,548
but otherwise all the children of this world

432
00:29:09,757 --> 00:29:12,632
are your own children

433
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,590
and you have to love them

434
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:17,298
as you would love your own children.

435
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,347
Christ has said, "Love thy neighbor as thyself."

436
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,057
I don't know why He said it because in all

437
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:27,427
Christian nations neighbors are the biggest problem.

438
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,632
Even here.

439
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:35,882
So I say, "Love thy child,

440
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:39,298
love other children as thy children".

441
00:29:39,506 --> 00:29:42,340
Let’s start at that point, maybe after that.

442
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:46,214
But normally there are places where they won't allow

443
00:29:46,423 --> 00:29:48,840
you to take a flat because you have children.

444
00:29:49,006 --> 00:29:51,048
I mean, imagine.

445
00:29:51,298 --> 00:29:56,632
Only unmarried people or barren people can live there.

446
00:29:56,882 --> 00:30:00,673
And also compulsory is that you should not have any child.

447
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,882
Even today you may not have child

448
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:05,823
but once you live there you should not have any child.

449
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:11,233
If you have a child then you are ousted. Can you imagine?

450
00:30:11,882 --> 00:30:15,089
About only thirty years back, people had twelve children,

451
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:18,882
fourteen children, they were competing in that

452
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:20,882
and lived very happily.

453
00:30:21,048 --> 00:30:26,214
And these days the problem has become like this,

454
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:29,506
that you should not have many children.

455
00:30:29,715 --> 00:30:34,173
Those who started the problem are having no children at all.

456
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:37,715
Those who said should be controlled, see,

457
00:30:37,882 --> 00:30:42,214
anywhere in the west the growth is minus.

458
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,006
Who is doing that? Shri Ganesh.

459
00:30:45,214 --> 00:30:48,882
You don't want children, all right.  Don't have.

460
00:30:49,423 --> 00:30:52,715
Except for Sahaja Yogis, nobody gets child.

461
00:30:53,048 --> 00:30:55,798
In this place, Mohan got his child first

462
00:30:55,964 --> 00:30:59,048
so in the whole village there was a celebration.

463
00:30:59,256 --> 00:31:03,798
There has been no child born here for years together.

464
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,256
But then, again, the problem is like this.

465
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:12,340
When I say this, I find Sahaja Yogis go to another extreme.

466
00:31:12,548 --> 00:31:17,340
They are stuck to their children; “stuck” actually is the word.

467
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:24,548
Which is very wrong.

468
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:27,923
I'm not saying you should neglect your child in any way,

469
00:31:28,131 --> 00:31:33,298
or you should in any way beat them or trouble them,

470
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:35,298
all these things.

471
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:38,715
You must love them in such a manner

472
00:31:39,256 --> 00:31:42,882
that they should know, if they do anything wrong

473
00:31:43,089 --> 00:31:45,506
they'll lose your love.

474
00:31:45,715 --> 00:31:50,340
Because for children love is the most important thing.

475
00:31:54,757 --> 00:31:57,798
They should know this, what you don't like.

476
00:31:57,964 --> 00:32:01,089
You should tell them what you don't like.

477
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:05,256
And you will be amazed

478
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:10,964
how children will not do anything

479
00:32:11,214 --> 00:32:15,548
that will make you unhappy with them.

480
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,381
Now that's a trick I think one has to learn.

481
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,673
This is the best way to grow your children.

482
00:32:22,882 --> 00:32:25,423
I'll tell you a story of My own daughter.

483
00:32:25,632 --> 00:32:29,882
She went to Delhi and all the girls were having sleeveless blouses.

484
00:32:30,256 --> 00:32:33,590
So she asked Me,

485
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:37,151
"I want to have sleeveless blouses."

486
00:32:37,312 --> 00:32:39,590
She was grown up, she was going to college.

487
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:42,214
I said, "All right, have it, whatever you like."

488
00:32:42,423 --> 00:32:45,964
Then said, "By the way, why don't You wear sleeveless?"

489
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:49,214
I said, "I feel shy."

490
00:32:50,923 --> 00:32:54,256
"Then why should You allow me?  This is no criteria.

491
00:32:54,465 --> 00:32:58,757
Whatever I ask, You say, ‘yes’ to me.  I'm not that grown up."

492
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:04,298
Even My granddaughter, she was here,

493
00:33:04,506 --> 00:33:05,590
she asked Me,

494
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,673
"Nani, why do you wear always blouses with sleeves?"

495
00:33:09,882 --> 00:33:14,882
I said, "Do you know these are very important chakras,

496
00:33:15,298 --> 00:33:18,256
the most important chakras for our body.

497
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:21,715
If you keep them open, these two or these two,

498
00:33:21,882 --> 00:33:23,673
then you will have problems."

499
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:27,964
"My goodness, I must wear now full sleeve."

500
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,340
Immediately they understood.

501
00:33:31,632 --> 00:33:34,381
So something deep, if you tell them

502
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:39,423
in a deep manner which is respecting their innocence,

503
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,381
they will improve.

504
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,381
For example, a child comes spoilt child,

505
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,048
he does very well in the class and all that.

506
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,465
Now one way is to beat him up, shout at him,

507
00:33:50,673 --> 00:33:52,715
scold him - these are one.

508
00:33:52,882 --> 00:33:55,256
Another simple thing is

509
00:33:55,465 --> 00:33:59,840
to talk to him, “See, supposing you stand first,

510
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:04,964
supposing you get good marks, you become a great man.

511
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:08,882
How proud I will be.  Everybody will be proud of you.

512
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,923
But supposing you do not,

513
00:34:11,131 --> 00:34:13,840
then they will think, ‘Oh, he's a useless fellow,

514
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:16,632
he'll have to beg on the street.’”

515
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,548
Immediately, he'll change.

516
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:24,214
The handling of the children is very important.

517
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:27,340
Innocence is to be handled

518
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:29,632
in a very delicate manner

519
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,131
as you would handle a beautiful flower.

520
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,840
It's a flower.

521
00:34:36,131 --> 00:34:41,256
As flower has fragrance, also innocence has fragrance.

522
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:46,798
Now this Ganesha was made out of the Mother Earth.

523
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:10,423
He was made out of Mother Earth.

524
00:35:11,006 --> 00:35:15,882
Mother Earth is the essence of innocence.

525
00:35:17,214 --> 00:35:19,256
See this Mother Earth,

526
00:35:19,548 --> 00:35:22,465
we don't look after, we don't give Her water,

527
00:35:22,673 --> 00:35:25,298
we don't do anything for Her,

528
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:30,798
but how She's trying to enrich our life;

529
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:35,882
how She's trying to cool us down;

530
00:35:36,882 --> 00:35:40,506
how She works out for us things

531
00:35:40,715 --> 00:35:45,173
which normally cannot be improved.

532
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:51,214
To respect this Mother Earth  is very important

533
00:35:51,423 --> 00:35:54,938
for all the innocent people. They do.

534
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:57,715
I've seen children, they respect the Mother Earth.

535
00:35:57,882 --> 00:36:02,506
They like to play on the mud, they like to play on sands,

536
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:05,882
they want to build castles,

537
00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:15,465
and all kinds of things they do with the Mother Earth.

538
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:19,340
But they are not attached, that's one thing.

539
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,923
They are not attached.They'll build a castle.

540
00:36:22,131 --> 00:36:24,882
All right, finished, now finish this.

541
00:36:25,048 --> 00:36:26,882
Then they go to the airport,

542
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:31,006
there they find something, they all join to make it a joy.

543
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:33,465
Wherever they go

544
00:36:33,673 --> 00:36:36,131
they find it easy to make that thing

545
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,882
for their enjoyment. To them, enjoyment is important.

546
00:36:41,672 --> 00:36:44,423
To them, yesterday, as I said time is not important.

547
00:36:44,632 --> 00:36:46,882
How much you enjoy is important.

548
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:51,632
Time is a headache for the grown-ups.

549
00:36:51,882 --> 00:36:54,340
Children don't worry.

550
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:58,506
You take them somewhere in a nice place

551
00:36:59,506 --> 00:37:02,419
so they don't want to come our way.

552
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,423
You ask them, "Lets go home."

553
00:37:04,632 --> 00:37:08,757
"Why?  For what? Why should we go home?"

554
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:11,501
They can't understand.

555
00:37:11,882 --> 00:37:17,006
They love all that is natural, all that is beautiful.

556
00:37:17,256 --> 00:37:21,298
They don't know the value in the money form.

557
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,798
They know the value of something

558
00:37:23,964 --> 00:37:26,964
in the form of love.

559
00:37:28,131 --> 00:37:30,882
I have seen Myself,

560
00:37:31,173 --> 00:37:35,048
you see, if you give something to children

561
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:39,381
they'll keep it there, even Sahaja Yogis,

562
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,298
and they'll show you, “I've got it.”

563
00:37:43,632 --> 00:37:49,757
See the essence of Shri Ganesha is pure love.

564
00:37:52,964 --> 00:37:56,882
The pure love of this Mother Earth

565
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,632
created Shri Ganesha,

566
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,131
or Adi Shakti created out of the pure love.

567
00:38:05,423 --> 00:38:06,923
But surprisingly,

568
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:11,840
Shri Ganesha was created before the Mother Earth,

569
00:38:12,214 --> 00:38:14,048
so how it is?

570
00:38:14,256 --> 00:38:17,506
So first He was created only

571
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:20,882
as the Logos, as they call it, or we call it

572
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:24,423
the Brahmanadha, Omkara.

573
00:38:24,882 --> 00:38:29,423
First He was created only as the sound of Omkara.

574
00:38:30,006 --> 00:38:32,632
Then this Omkara

575
00:38:32,882 --> 00:38:36,632
was covered with the Mother Earth

576
00:38:36,964 --> 00:38:40,214
to make Shri Ganesha.

577
00:38:40,673 --> 00:38:46,381
So, Omkar is so important

578
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:51,256
because it has got in it

579
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:57,173
all the three powers, A-U-M.

580
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:04,298
A-U-M stands for the Mahakali,

581
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:08,715
Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi's powers.

582
00:39:09,506 --> 00:39:13,923
All these three powers exist in this Omkara.

583
00:39:14,506 --> 00:39:17,673
So in a dormant form, we can say

584
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:21,923
those three powers exist in Shri Ganesha.

585
00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:27,757
So when we try to harm Him,

586
00:39:28,006 --> 00:39:32,214
then we are harming the Shakti within us,

587
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:35,590
which is Omkar,

588
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,590
which fills the whole universe,

589
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,964
which fills all the vibrations.

590
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,882
In the vibrations these powers move.

591
00:39:47,256 --> 00:39:51,256
These three powers fill up every vibration.

592
00:39:51,715 --> 00:39:54,423
That's why they know, they understand

593
00:39:54,632 --> 00:39:59,381
and they work out the whole thing in such a manner that...

594
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,757
Supposing now somebody has broken his legs,

595
00:40:02,923 --> 00:40:05,465
take it like that.

596
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:10,006
Now, I sit down here and may give a bandhan.

597
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,465
Immediately, immediately,

598
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:20,623
a power is sent, immediately.

599
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:23,373
Somehow,

600
00:40:23,665 --> 00:40:27,956
is faster than all your communications that you use

601
00:40:28,498 --> 00:40:31,914
and immediately things work out.

602
00:40:34,248 --> 00:40:39,123
How it works out? Now it's a very complicated stuff,

603
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,998
but it’s also very uncomplicated because

604
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:46,331
it is the work of Shri Ganesh.

605
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:50,373
He's not interested.

606
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:53,123
You see, if there's any problem, all right,

607
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:57,623
like making a little fort on the seashore;

608
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:02,039
All right, it will melt it, finished, back again.

609
00:41:02,498 --> 00:41:05,498
He's not attached.

610
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:09,873
So what should we do

611
00:41:10,498 --> 00:41:14,164
to show our gratitude to this little child?

612
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:18,623
Supposing you say to a child, “Thank you.”

613
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,415
He’ll say, “Hey, what did you say?"

614
00:41:21,623 --> 00:41:23,873
Won't understand, children don't understand

615
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:25,826
why should we thank them.

616
00:41:25,987 --> 00:41:27,654
We teach them say "thank you,"

617
00:41:27,815 --> 00:41:30,975
so even if they have to say "sorry", they’ll say "thank you"

618
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:35,164
because they know only one word, "thank you". So they say "thank you".

619
00:41:35,456 --> 00:41:37,248
Now these children,

620
00:41:37,456 --> 00:41:41,956
how will they play, in the same way this Omkara plays.

621
00:41:43,665 --> 00:41:49,415
Most detached, as they call "Nishkriya", to the power.

622
00:41:49,623 --> 00:41:52,039
Means doesn't do anything.

623
00:41:52,331 --> 00:41:54,498
Nothing, just paying attention.

624
00:41:54,707 --> 00:41:57,914
If somebody gets cured, gets saved,

625
00:41:58,164 --> 00:42:02,456
somebody gets vibrations,

626
00:42:03,123 --> 00:42:05,707
who does it?  Shri Ganesh.

627
00:42:06,998 --> 00:42:12,081
But He is not attached, He's not attached,

628
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:15,415
He doesn't want any credit for it.  It's His job.

629
00:42:15,623 --> 00:42:18,206
He will send one Ganas, all right, go to... fast .

630
00:42:18,415 --> 00:42:20,206
They will run fast,

631
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:24,415
more than any one of your modern - the most modern

632
00:42:24,623 --> 00:42:27,790
vehicle that you have as aeroplanes or anything.

633
00:42:27,956 --> 00:42:31,415
Immediately, I'm telling you again, the word is that.

634
00:42:31,623 --> 00:42:35,164
Just as if you press the button, it works.

635
00:42:35,373 --> 00:42:38,498
But on some people it does not,

636
00:42:38,707 --> 00:42:42,206
if they are surrounded by people who have no faith,

637
00:42:42,665 --> 00:42:45,373
if they themselves have half faith or something.

638
00:42:45,582 --> 00:42:50,498
He is the judge of your faith in the Mother

639
00:42:50,707 --> 00:42:56,707
because He has absolute faith in His Mother - absolutely.

640
00:42:56,998 --> 00:43:03,331
In the same way, those who have absolute faith in His Mother,

641
00:43:04,914 --> 00:43:08,456
He looks after them.

642
00:43:08,832 --> 00:43:11,832
He really looks after them.

643
00:43:11,998 --> 00:43:15,123
Also He destroys.

644
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:24,039
Once a person told Me

645
00:43:24,248 --> 00:43:27,415
about a minister in India,

646
00:43:27,623 --> 00:43:30,123
a very nasty fellow,

647
00:43:30,331 --> 00:43:34,582
very corrupt, immoral, everything put together.

648
00:43:35,283 --> 00:43:38,408
He was going on, carrying on,

649
00:43:38,569 --> 00:43:42,122
but this was a nice Sahaja Yogi, very good Sahaja Yogi. He told Me

650
00:43:42,283 --> 00:43:45,170
that this man has now started troubling him

651
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:48,028
and wants him to do something dishonest.

652
00:43:48,189 --> 00:43:53,331
I said, “Really?” I said, “Really here and there".

653
00:43:53,582 --> 00:43:57,998
This great minister had to resign and go away.

654
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:02,095
That moment.

655
00:44:02,296 --> 00:44:06,171
Is a fact.  I can show you so many such things,

656
00:44:06,415 --> 00:44:12,581
but the faith of Shri Ganesha is tremendous.

657
00:44:15,187 --> 00:44:19,979
He never doubts, and He's not attached.

658
00:44:20,182 --> 00:44:21,587
So many people sometimes,

659
00:44:21,748 --> 00:44:24,665
"Mother, you know we did this, we went there,

660
00:44:24,832 --> 00:44:28,415
we had to climb up so much, and then we gave realization

661
00:44:28,623 --> 00:44:33,206
only to one person". Finished.

662
00:44:34,036 --> 00:44:36,786
What's the use?  Don't give any realization.

663
00:44:36,947 --> 00:44:38,994
I have told hundred times to people,

664
00:44:39,155 --> 00:44:42,313
if you think you are doing any work, better not do it.

665
00:44:42,473 --> 00:44:45,348
It's no good doing such work.

666
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:48,682
If you are attached to it, then better not do it.

667
00:44:48,848 --> 00:44:53,931
You do it for fun, just for joy, just for faith in your Mother.

668
00:44:56,223 --> 00:44:58,682
With this absolute faith you never feel fatigued,

669
00:44:58,848 --> 00:45:02,223
you never feel tired. You see Shri Ganesha's work.

670
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:04,432
All these bandhans, who carries?

671
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:09,456
Shriman Ganesh Mahoday.

672
00:45:12,682 --> 00:45:17,140
He, with His big belly,

673
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,931
just orders His people,

674
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,390
and these Ganeshas, Ganas,

675
00:45:22,598 --> 00:45:26,723
are the most competent people you can find.

676
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:32,098
You get Me any competent person, any scientist,

677
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:36,223
no one can beat them.

678
00:45:36,557 --> 00:45:39,557
How can they cure a person?

679
00:45:39,848 --> 00:45:44,515
Say a lady had a son in Mexico who was sick

680
00:45:44,848 --> 00:45:48,598
and he had a fatal disease which was in their family

681
00:45:48,764 --> 00:45:52,682
but they always used to get it at an age

682
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:56,432
when they were very old.

683
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,682
But he was a young boy studying in Harvard.

684
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:02,383
She wrote to Me three letters

685
00:46:02,544 --> 00:46:05,711
and in these three letters she was wondering, “What should I do?

686
00:46:05,872 --> 00:46:09,223
Should I send him to You?” And I was, you see,

687
00:46:09,432 --> 00:46:12,265
jumping from one tree to another tree.

688
00:46:12,473 --> 00:46:14,806
I said, "Where would you meet Me?"

689
00:46:15,014 --> 00:46:17,306
I just thought of it,

690
00:46:17,515 --> 00:46:20,140
and fourth letter comes in, that she took him

691
00:46:20,348 --> 00:46:23,640
to the hospital in Harvard University

692
00:46:23,806 --> 00:46:27,056
and there she took him to some other hospital,

693
00:46:27,265 --> 00:46:29,313
and all the hospitals declared that

694
00:46:29,473 --> 00:46:33,014
he is absolutely all right, he's completely cured.

695
00:46:37,348 --> 00:46:42,682
But, your faith. Her faith has worked.

696
00:46:43,306 --> 00:46:47,265
It is the mother's faith has worked for the son.

697
00:46:48,265 --> 00:46:52,056
It’s very easy to doubt Me, it's very easy.

698
00:46:52,348 --> 00:46:56,806
It's a slippery ground, I tell you, very easy to doubt Me.

699
00:46:59,014 --> 00:47:01,973
Because people doubt people for what they wear.

700
00:47:02,181 --> 00:47:04,098
Now they will say,

701
00:47:04,306 --> 00:47:06,889
"Why was She wearing such an expensive sari?"

702
00:47:07,098 --> 00:47:12,764
This is a selection of Mr. Guido the great, not Mine.

703
00:47:14,682 --> 00:47:17,889
He forced Me to buy this.

704
00:47:19,557 --> 00:47:22,390
What can I do?

705
00:47:23,682 --> 00:47:30,056
But I'm not attached, but to keep his spirits all right

706
00:47:31,973 --> 00:47:35,557
I wear it, just to please them.

707
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,473
Even children, you will be surprised,

708
00:47:40,682 --> 00:47:45,056
they feel very pleased if you do something that they like.

709
00:47:46,348 --> 00:47:48,764
They are very, very,

710
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:52,542
I shouldn't say intelligent because I don't like that word very much

711
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,203
but I should say, very subtly understanding things.

712
00:47:58,014 --> 00:48:02,014
One of My granddaughters, eldest one, she's a gem of a gem.

713
00:48:02,473 --> 00:48:07,515
She, I took for her a Wendy's house and she built it up.

714
00:48:08,056 --> 00:48:10,598
And My daughter is quite tall.

715
00:48:10,764 --> 00:48:13,515
She called her, “Mummy, come to my house."

716
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,056
So this daughter of Mine went there

717
00:48:16,265 --> 00:48:18,306
and she entered inside the house

718
00:48:18,515 --> 00:48:21,098
and she broke the whole thing.

719
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:23,645
So it is, my granddaughter came to Me,

720
00:48:23,806 --> 00:48:25,348
"See. Look at your daughter.

721
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:28,550
You have taught her no manners of any kind."

722
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:32,306
I said, "Why, what happened?”, "She comes into my house

723
00:48:32,515 --> 00:48:35,014
and asks such an unmannerly question,

724
00:48:35,175 --> 00:48:37,008
‘What have you got for me to eat?’

725
00:48:37,169 --> 00:48:40,025
Do you do that when you are going into somebody's house?

726
00:48:40,186 --> 00:48:41,645
Do you ask such a question?

727
00:48:41,806 --> 00:48:44,098
And when I said, ‘You can't ask such a question

728
00:48:44,306 --> 00:48:45,515
in somebody else’s house,’

729
00:48:45,682 --> 00:48:48,848
she laughed so much that she broke my house.

730
00:48:49,105 --> 00:48:52,669
Is this the way to behave? You have never taught them.

731
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,014
Grandma you have taught us everything nice.

732
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:57,385
You have never taught her how to behave

733
00:48:57,546 --> 00:48:59,515
when you go to somebody's house.”

734
00:48:59,682 --> 00:49:02,306
You see?  So innocent.

735
00:49:03,181 --> 00:49:05,764
So innocent the whole thing was,

736
00:49:06,056 --> 00:49:09,265
that just to please her,

737
00:49:09,515 --> 00:49:13,598
even a small thing if you do, you can please them.

738
00:49:13,848 --> 00:49:15,889
Very simple thing.

739
00:49:16,265 --> 00:49:19,390
Now His power is Kundalini.

740
00:49:19,598 --> 00:49:22,473
Well, this is another problem.

741
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:26,889
She is the power of Shri Ganesha

742
00:49:27,223 --> 00:49:31,432
and without Him She won't rise.

743
00:49:32,098 --> 00:49:35,598
What a complication - now tell Me.

744
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:41,098
Like, if My child says,

745
00:49:41,348 --> 00:49:46,140
"You can't go out of this house without asking me",

746
00:49:47,223 --> 00:49:49,306
so you can't just do anything,

747
00:49:49,557 --> 00:49:52,682
you are bound to the house.

748
00:49:53,306 --> 00:49:54,931
So in the same way,

749
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,931
without taking the permission of Shri Ganesha,

750
00:49:59,223 --> 00:50:01,973
Kundalini won't rise.

751
00:50:02,223 --> 00:50:05,265
It's very difficult,

752
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:09,931
impossible I should say.

753
00:50:11,056 --> 00:50:14,056
Of course, the Mooladhara will go on like this,

754
00:50:14,265 --> 00:50:18,306
pumping just like a heart,

755
00:50:19,306 --> 00:50:21,222
but it won't come up

756
00:50:21,382 --> 00:50:24,006
because Kundalini would like to do

757
00:50:24,215 --> 00:50:27,756
but He won't allow Her to go.

758
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:32,131
Those who are immoral,

759
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,131
those who have done immoral things,

760
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:39,632
and those who are spoiling

761
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:42,714
the Ganesha principle of others,

762
00:50:42,923 --> 00:50:46,090
are very difficult for realization.

763
00:50:46,465 --> 00:50:49,215
But I have seen some people

764
00:50:49,423 --> 00:50:52,673
who have asked for forgiveness

765
00:50:53,215 --> 00:50:56,548
and the Mother has told Shri Ganesh to forgive,

766
00:50:56,714 --> 00:50:59,465
they have got realization.

767
00:50:59,632 --> 00:51:01,881
Only that's the point,

768
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:04,590
that if you approach through the Mother,

769
00:51:04,756 --> 00:51:06,756
He will forgive you.

770
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:09,298
Definitely, He'll forgive you.

771
00:51:09,507 --> 00:51:11,964
There is such a nice

772
00:51:12,173 --> 00:51:15,923
relationship between the mother and child.

773
00:51:16,426 --> 00:51:19,714
That's something good, otherwise this fellow would have killed

774
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:24,041
at least ninety percent of people in the modern times.

775
00:51:26,548 --> 00:51:32,590
So it is such a blessing, also,

776
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:36,839
such a promise,

777
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:41,382
that if we look after our Shri Ganesh principle,

778
00:51:42,465 --> 00:51:44,839
keep ourselves clean,

779
00:51:45,048 --> 00:51:47,215
keep our eyes clean,

780
00:51:47,465 --> 00:51:52,714
and develop pure relationships among ourselves,

781
00:51:55,756 --> 00:52:00,173
we'll have no problem of any kind.

782
00:52:00,507 --> 00:52:03,173
You'll have proper relations with your wife,

783
00:52:03,382 --> 00:52:06,131
proper relations with your children,

784
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:09,507
and proper relations in the family,

785
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:13,256
proper relations in the society,

786
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:18,881
proper relations in the politics, economics,

787
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:24,340
and all various areas in which you move.

788
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:28,548
Your innocence will help.

789
00:52:29,215 --> 00:52:33,256
You might think that people are trying to befool you.

790
00:52:33,798 --> 00:52:39,798
Let them try and you see what happens.

791
00:52:41,298 --> 00:52:45,590
Let them try to attack your innocence

792
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:49,382
and see what they get out of it.

793
00:52:52,298 --> 00:52:57,590
It is such a blessing you all have as human beings,

794
00:52:58,006 --> 00:53:00,423
that your Mooladhara is so well developed

795
00:53:00,632 --> 00:53:03,173
and Shri Ganesha is nicely settled down.

796
00:53:03,382 --> 00:53:05,632
You all have got your realization

797
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,465
and now whatever we were enjoying -

798
00:53:08,673 --> 00:53:12,632
- yesterday, just like children, don't you think so?

799
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,123
We had forgotten our age, everything,

800
00:53:15,284 --> 00:53:18,173
we were just like children enjoying everything,

801
00:53:18,382 --> 00:53:21,215
whether the dance were rhythmic, unrhythmic

802
00:53:21,423 --> 00:53:24,756
or inconsistent, we didn't mind.

803
00:53:26,507 --> 00:53:28,798
Everything we enjoyed.

804
00:53:29,048 --> 00:53:32,632
No rules, regulations are needed for enjoyment.

805
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:36,131
And this enjoyment, the source of this enjoyment,

806
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,548
comes from the innocence that we have within us.

807
00:53:40,881 --> 00:53:42,256
Without innocence,

808
00:53:42,465 --> 00:53:45,881
you cannot enjoy anything with this mind

809
00:53:46,632 --> 00:53:50,298
and from this heart,

810
00:53:51,006 --> 00:53:56,798
because in the heart resides the father,

811
00:53:58,964 --> 00:54:02,006
Shiva.

812
00:54:02,298 --> 00:54:05,507
They are terrible people,

813
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:09,298
snakes around them.

814
00:54:10,006 --> 00:54:11,131
You...

815
00:54:13,673 --> 00:54:17,173
Not easy...

816
00:54:17,465 --> 00:54:21,714
If you can stand on your feet for fifteen years

817
00:54:21,923 --> 00:54:24,548
and go on saying,

818
00:54:24,756 --> 00:54:27,173
“Om Namaha Shivaya, Om Namaha Shivaya”,

819
00:54:27,382 --> 00:54:32,964
then maybe Shiva might grant you some boon.

820
00:54:33,507 --> 00:54:38,090
It's the most difficult deity to please, is Shiva.

821
00:54:38,632 --> 00:54:41,131
Though He is very innocent Himself,

822
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,673
He is too innocent, so much so,

823
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:45,756
just like a white cloth you can say.

824
00:54:45,964 --> 00:54:51,881
Any bit of spot on your character, finished,

825
00:54:52,215 --> 00:54:54,632
condemned.

826
00:54:55,673 --> 00:55:00,340
But even a rakshasa stands on his leg

827
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:03,215
for twenty-five years maybe

828
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:07,714
and goes on praising Him, then He may forgive.

829
00:55:11,507 --> 00:55:14,048
Shri Ganesha doesn't forgive.

830
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:18,131
So the only person left to you is your Mother,

831
00:55:18,756 --> 00:55:20,798
who just forgives.

832
00:55:21,006 --> 00:55:24,423
I don't want to have any headache of this not-forgivingness.

833
00:55:24,584 --> 00:55:28,305
It's a big headache. If you don't forgive somebody, I get a headache,

834
00:55:28,465 --> 00:55:31,756
so I don't want Myself to do that.

835
00:55:31,964 --> 00:55:36,923
So I just forgive. I forgive.

836
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:42,798
I forgive all the Sahaja yogis all the time.

837
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,465
There have been some horrible, nasty fellows.

838
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:50,714
I don't want to be angry with them because Ganesha will

839
00:55:50,923 --> 00:55:52,382
just finish them.

840
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:55,756
Automatically, Ganesha is doing something,

841
00:55:56,006 --> 00:55:59,131
but at least He doesn't do it so fast

842
00:55:59,507 --> 00:56:03,340
because they have called Me Mother and I respect it.

843
00:56:04,507 --> 00:56:07,673
Of course, they have been very troublesome, horrible, I know.

844
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:11,465
I know why you are angry with them,

845
00:56:13,298 --> 00:56:18,006
but forgiveness is the best punishment

846
00:56:19,423 --> 00:56:24,215
by which they realize their mistakes

847
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,548
and out of hundred, ninety-nine people

848
00:56:28,714 --> 00:56:32,798
will enjoy forgiveness than punishment.

849
00:56:36,632 --> 00:56:40,756
So all this is done by Shri Ganesha

850
00:56:41,756 --> 00:56:44,923
and He is all the time with you.

851
00:56:45,173 --> 00:56:48,548
Your Ganesha is awakened, no doubt.

852
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:51,173
He is all the time with you.

853
00:56:51,423 --> 00:56:54,632
But some people have vibrations,

854
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:58,450
they get realization, then they are busy,

855
00:56:58,611 --> 00:57:01,353
say, if they are women, busy with their children,

856
00:57:01,514 --> 00:57:04,972
they have no time for Sahaja Yoga.

857
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:08,826
At the most, cleansing they'll do. But for what?

858
00:57:08,987 --> 00:57:11,237
Why are you cleansing?  Supposing this glass

859
00:57:11,398 --> 00:57:13,179
is cleansed, cleansed, cleansed,

860
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,465
and never used, what is the use of cleansing?

861
00:57:17,256 --> 00:57:19,673
They meditate for themselves,

862
00:57:19,881 --> 00:57:22,465
they cleanse for themselves,

863
00:57:22,632 --> 00:57:25,048
but never use their vibrations,

864
00:57:25,256 --> 00:57:29,632
never give vibrations.  How can that be?

865
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:34,215
You have to give vibrations.

866
00:57:34,423 --> 00:57:36,423
If you don't give vibrations to others,

867
00:57:36,632 --> 00:57:38,632
if you don't transform other people,

868
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:40,548
if you don't cure other people,

869
00:57:40,714 --> 00:57:44,798
if you don't teach them how to have pure love,

870
00:57:45,006 --> 00:57:48,256
what's the use of cleansing, coming to Puja,

871
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,340
feeling nice, joyous?  Finished.

872
00:57:51,881 --> 00:57:57,507
These are useless people, useless Sahaja Yogis.

873
00:57:58,507 --> 00:58:01,423
Ganesha is not happy.

874
00:58:01,632 --> 00:58:03,006
How can He be happy?

875
00:58:03,215 --> 00:58:07,465
His Puja is to give realization.

876
00:58:08,465 --> 00:58:10,548
That is His Puja.

877
00:58:10,714 --> 00:58:13,590
Supposing He is waiting there, say,

878
00:58:13,798 --> 00:58:17,048
for you to ask for His blessings.

879
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:21,590
Now what is His blessing?  Is to give realization,

880
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:24,090
to allow the Kundalini to rise.

881
00:58:24,298 --> 00:58:28,964
You ask for it and what do you get?

882
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:34,090
You ask for your health, ask for this, ask for that.

883
00:58:34,465 --> 00:58:36,632
Why not ask,

884
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:40,673
"Shri Ganesh, make us good instruments of Sahaja Yoga.

885
00:58:40,881 --> 00:58:44,465
Give us strength to give realization to people

886
00:58:44,632 --> 00:58:47,340
and talk about Sahaja Yoga."

887
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,090
People don't even talk about Sahaja Yoga.

888
00:58:50,298 --> 00:58:54,090
They are feeling shy.  Why should you be shy?

889
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:56,582
One day I was traveling by train,

890
00:58:56,748 --> 00:58:58,954
I met a lady, she sat next to Me

891
00:58:59,115 --> 00:59:01,944
and she was following some sort of a cult, I don’t know,

892
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:03,914
some Muslim cult,

893
00:59:04,075 --> 00:59:06,415
and the whole time she was boring Me.

894
00:59:06,582 --> 00:59:08,789
I started feeling sleepy

895
00:59:08,998 --> 00:59:11,415
but whenever I got up she was still talking

896
00:59:11,582 --> 00:59:12,873
about that cult.

897
00:59:13,081 --> 00:59:15,623
I said, "Sahaja Yogis will never do that."

898
00:59:15,831 --> 00:59:18,415
You must talk about it.  You must tell people.

899
00:59:18,582 --> 00:59:20,165
You must go around.

900
00:59:20,373 --> 00:59:23,873
Don't be afraid, Ganesha will protect you.

901
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:26,582
He'll help you, He'll be very happy.

902
00:59:27,165 --> 00:59:29,748
He'll work it out, everything for you.

903
00:59:29,956 --> 00:59:32,040
All problems can be solved.

904
00:59:32,248 --> 00:59:33,748
Everything can be done.

905
00:59:33,956 --> 00:59:38,789
Believe in His power.

906
00:59:39,248 --> 00:59:41,290
Have faith in your Mother.

907
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:44,332
That is the message of Shri Ganesha.

908
00:59:44,574 --> 00:59:47,139
May God bless you.

909
00:59:53,081 --> 00:59:56,873
Today of course I would like chidren to come up for the Puja,

910
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:03,290
say, they should be all below six years, would be better idea.

911
01:00:06,123 --> 01:00:08,873
Say, from two years to six years, we could have small ones.

912
01:00:09,457 --> 01:00:12,998
Or maybe eight years, but then they grow up I think, after that.
