1
00:00:05,754 --> 00:00:15,144
I am really over-delighted that in France
we have so many visitors as well as French

2
00:00:15,144 --> 00:00:23,094
Sahaja Yogis for this Puja. That shows the
collectivity. The collectivity which attracts

3
00:00:23,094 --> 00:00:33,824
all of you from all over the places, and that
you try to enjoy that collectivity. But the

4
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:49,674
basis of collectivity, the foundation of collectivity
is very deep. And the deep understanding can

5
00:00:49,674 --> 00:01:06,124
only tell you that the basis of collectivity
is detached love. Love is the only way. It's

6
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:17,644
not possible to have collectivity unless and
until you have detached love. French have

7
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:27,894
been good at so many types of love that they
have been talking about. And they have written

8
00:01:27,894 --> 00:01:34,474
books after books, novels after novels and
have created lots of romantic and unromantic

9
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:48,133
and all kinds of atmospheres to talk of love.
But the pure love as we understand in Sahaja

10
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:58,824
Yoga is to be now expressed by Sahaja Yogis
among themselves.

11
00:01:58,824 --> 00:02:16,124
After all, we are all human beings made by
one God. And that we are all Sahaja Yogis

12
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:31,044
created by one Mother. So there should be
no misunderstanding between us of any kind.

13
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:42,944
But we must know what sometimes makes us little
different. If we can understand the problems

14
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:54,444
that we face, then it would be much easier
for us to see why our love becomes so attached

15
00:02:54,444 --> 00:03:07,664
and not so detached. Starts becoming smaller
and smaller, then a person just starts loving

16
00:03:07,664 --> 00:03:23,584
oneself only. One of the main reasons that
we have this problem is because of our conditionings.

17
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:31,944
We are conditioned the way that we don't know
how to love.

18
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:41,744
When I see the advertisements in the West,
I don't know from where the West starts and

19
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:47,574
where it ends and from where the East ends.
They talk of West and East, but I don't know

20
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:56,554
which is the demarcating line. Can anybody
tell Me that? Where do we start East and West,

21
00:03:56,554 --> 00:04:06,994
because it's one round world, you see? (Laughter)
But somehow or other there is some line, unknown

22
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:18,154
line, underlying line which creates sometimes
this East and West - two types of conditionings.

23
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:33,263
So, when I see some advertisements they show
about, recently I saw, about James Bond that

24
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:55,354
he is free to kill and the best film for revenge
- this is the advertisement. If revenge is

25
00:04:55,354 --> 00:05:06,024
the best way of fulfillment, then how can
we love someone? So, this kind of conditioning

26
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:19,154
comes to us from outside. That we should not
forgive anyone, we should take the revenge.

27
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:28,374
And if you do not take the revenge then you
are not worthy your name. So, if you cannot

28
00:05:28,374 --> 00:05:35,513
take the revenge, like a duel that they used
to have in France quite a lot between the

29
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:42,084
two persons. They would take two guns and
kill each other. I mean, what a stupid idea

30
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:47,414
it was! Just think of it in modern times.
But it was so.

31
00:05:47,414 --> 00:06:00,774
So, if the revenge is not taken then it was
thought to be something very sly, very low

32
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:13,854
level. So, a person must take revenge. History
shows also the same things that one had to

33
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:27,904
take a revenge of another person who has harmed
you in any way, troubled you. I think it's

34
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:36,054
the quality of a snake, they say. That if
you step onto any snake, it follows you all

35
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:44,384
his life to take the revenge. The only thing
that it does all its life is to run after

36
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:56,054
that person who has by mistake put the foot
on its body. In the same way a human endeavor,

37
00:06:56,054 --> 00:07:04,444
I have seen in so many novels it's suggested
how a man gets after a person who has some

38
00:07:04,444 --> 00:07:20,144
way or other harmed. If we go on like this,
there's no end to it. Firstly, it is absolutely

39
00:07:20,144 --> 00:07:21,054
absurd.

40
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:30,323
For that, I will give you an example of Buddha,
very much I have been impressed by the way

41
00:07:30,323 --> 00:07:37,263
He said once to somebody who insulted Him
and abused Him and said all kinds of horrible

42
00:07:37,263 --> 00:07:46,774
words. Then Buddha went to another village.
Now, this fellow felt the remorse and he went

43
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:54,054
back, and back, and said, "Sir, I'm sorry.
I have said these things to you. I'm really

44
00:07:54,054 --> 00:08:03,424
very sorry." He said, "What? When?" He said,
"Yesterday." He said, "Yesterday is finished

45
00:08:03,424 --> 00:08:13,194
now. You are now with Me today. So, why are
you talking about yesterday? It's finished."

46
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:20,763
So, with this kind of idea that somebody has
harmed us, somebody is horrid to us we linger

47
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:25,114
on in the past.

48
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:42,074
Now, I'm told they are celebrating the French
Revolution that took place. If you ask Me

49
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:47,954
there was no need to have revolution of that
kind to kill Marie Antoinette. It was not

50
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:55,574
necessary. If they had killed or not killed,
it would have been all right. But they had

51
00:08:55,574 --> 00:09:05,924
to kill her. Why? Because according to them
she spent lot of money in Versailles and created

52
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:11,374
some beautiful furniture. Today only they
are showing that furniture only. What is there

53
00:09:11,374 --> 00:09:19,444
to show in this France? As soon as you come,
they say, "Have you seen her palace?" I said,

54
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:20,014
"Really?"

55
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:26,694
First time when I came to France, this was
the first question. "You must go and see this.

56
00:09:26,694 --> 00:09:31,664
Impossible, you cannot get such beautiful
things anywhere created. It's an impossible

57
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:37,004
situation." I said, "Impossible?" "Yes, because
you cannot make such nice things."

58
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:43,984
She made such nice beautiful things. She was
not going to carry it with her. Now, when

59
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:55,254
you murdered her, then you ask Me to go and
see those beautiful things. We have to learn

60
00:09:55,254 --> 00:10:01,264
from history that it was stupid to kill her.
What was the need to kill her? When you have

61
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:07,704
taken over the government, all right, stop
at that point and then you start governing.

62
00:10:07,704 --> 00:10:14,204
With that revolution you think world has improved
for us? Anywhere in the world, do you think

63
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:29,664
things have improved? Also, the
revolution should have been to change the
government. All right! But to go to that limit

64
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:31,224
was not necessary.

65
00:10:31,224 --> 00:10:39,264
So, the second conditioning that comes to
us that we cross all limits of humanity when

66
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:45,384
we take revenge. They would not have been
satisfied that she was still living. "Oh God,

67
00:10:45,384 --> 00:10:57,954
we have to kill her!" Of course, I don't say
that somebody who has done any harm to the

68
00:10:57,954 --> 00:11:08,594
country, to the nation, should be allowed
to go on like that. But how far you go with

69
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:17,494
that is to be seen. So, the wisdom of Sahaja
Yoga is in understanding the limitations up

70
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:27,394
to which you can go to express your anger,
to express your revenge, so called, on anyone

71
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:40,333
whatsoever. But the best thing would be to
leave it to the Divine power, because everything

72
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:49,583
is done by Divine power. We all exist inside
the Divine power. We cannot think of anything

73
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:57,934
else of that kind. I cannot give you an analogy
how Divine power works. For example, if there

74
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:09,814
were no rays of the sun coming out of the
sun, staying inside the sun, and all things

75
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:20,023
working out, then we would have said, "It's
something like Divine power." Nothing is outside

76
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:29,184
that, everything is inside. And this Divine
power is the power of compassion and love,

77
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:39,734
which does everything. But when we take up
responsibility, and when we decide we have

78
00:12:39,734 --> 00:12:50,414
to do something, and that we are something,
and try to go against that Divine power, we

79
00:12:50,414 --> 00:13:00,074
become stupid people as we have seen. So,
to leave it in the hands of Divine power,

80
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:10,574
and to be just an instrument of that Divine
power is the way a Sahaja Yogi has to be.

81
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:20,934
Because the compassion, the love of Divine
power is so great that it is wisdom, complete

82
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:30,864
wisdom. A person who has no compassion cannot
be wise. He could be worldly wise but he could

83
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:45,664
not be really wise. So, those who believe
that they have to be - they have to be very

84
00:13:45,664 --> 00:14:04,034
accurate must know that your accuracy will
be challenged by the Divine power. There has

85
00:14:04,034 --> 00:14:16,554
to be lot of relaxed and a mobile temperament
a person should have.

86
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:25,164
For example, now I have come, suddenly perhaps
you were not told, people were not ready absolutely

87
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:37,104
in the formal manner, lined up together like
a military. It's all right, makes no difference.

88
00:14:37,104 --> 00:14:48,083
Makes no difference. I am in no way disturbed,
no way unhappy. I was very happy to see you

89
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:57,124
all. Because after all, you all love Me and
I love you. It's a family and there's nothing

90
00:14:57,124 --> 00:15:05,934
like being very formal about things. No formality
between you and God Almighty, there cannot

91
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:22,674
be. But there has to be understanding as to
what we are doing. I find suddenly human beings

92
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:38,903
either become extremely relaxed, extremely
lazy, extremely confused.

93
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:48,713
You ask them their name, they'll say ten times,
"Ah ... Ah". I said, "What's your name?" They

94
00:15:48,713 --> 00:16:02,564
will say, "Ah ...". "I just asked your name."
"What You asked me, my name?" "Yes, your name."

95
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:04,754
"Ah, I see." (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

96
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:11,953
So the - I mean, least bothered as to even
remember your own name or to say it. Like

97
00:16:11,953 --> 00:16:21,763
a drug acting on that person. That's going
too far. Another style is where too much of

98
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:32,953
formalities. That, supposing now, Mother is
coming and we have to give Her something,

99
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:41,944
and something is missing. All right, doesn't
matter. After all, this is Paris. Lots of

100
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:47,083
things were missing once upon a time. If there
is something missing, doesn't matter. It's

101
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:55,444
not so important, you should not be in tension.
If you are in tension you cannot absorb My

102
00:16:55,444 --> 00:16:58,874
vibrations. Or if you are lethargic also you
cannot absorb My vibrations. So, you have

103
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:11,404
to be in the center. Center, in a receptive
mood like a child is that you have to absorb

104
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:27,784
the vibrations with that feeling of expectation
and joy. We have to receive Mother. But not

105
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:33,464
with tension that, "This is not done, that
is not done." I see each and every thing so

106
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:43,844
beautifully done. So beautiful are these flowers,
everything done so well!

107
00:17:43,844 --> 00:17:53,144
And so many ideas. I can see them so clearly.
It's all expressive of not your tension but

108
00:17:53,144 --> 00:18:07,433
your love. So, are we expressing our love
or our tension? What is that we are doing?

109
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:18,314
Are we trying to be tense because we are over-alert,
or we are trying to neglect everything because

110
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:34,053
we want to escape? Between the two lies Sahaja
Yoga. You are very anxious, very much waiting.

111
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:44,144
You want to do something with your heart and
then, when there is fulfillment, you can enjoy.

112
00:18:44,144 --> 00:18:52,604
But you are tense, I come in, what I find
you all have headaches. So, first I have to

113
00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:59,484
tell you, "Remove your headaches first, then
I'll talk to you." So, it has to be a very

114
00:18:59,484 --> 00:19:07,494
relaxed rapport between us, but relaxed never
means lethargic. It doesn't mean, if you are

115
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:15,824
lethargic you'll be sleeping off and nothing
will go onto your ears.

116
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:25,834
So, what we see that our conditioning, one
conditioning we have that either we want people

117
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:34,024
to be over-alert or we want that they should
not be at all alert. So, the underlying problem

118
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:47,793
of all these things is this - that we want
extremes. In our conditionings we go to extremes.

119
00:19:47,793 --> 00:20:04,053
We go to extremes of this or extremes of that.
If you are absolutely lethargic, lenient,

120
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:16,034
disheveled, we can say absolutely confused,
you are not in the center. And on the contrary,

121
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:32,144
if you are very strict, like a Rock of Gibraltar
and after all like a big Hitler-like behavior

122
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:40,084
-"You should be in time, everybody must have
proper steps, must walk properly." That's

123
00:20:40,084 --> 00:20:43,534
not being Sahaj. That's not being Sahaj.

124
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:53,844
Now, look at these flowers. See one by one
how beautiful they are. Everyone is different,

125
00:20:53,844 --> 00:21:01,154
even one leaf of one flower will not match
with another. One petal won't match with another.

126
00:21:01,154 --> 00:21:12,774
They're all different, but so relaxed, creating
beauty, giving us so much of joy. All different.

127
00:21:12,774 --> 00:21:20,884
Placed in different manner, moving in different
manner. Everyone has a different angle. But

128
00:21:20,884 --> 00:21:32,494
there is unison. There is oneness in them
that they all want to give us joy. But with

129
00:21:32,494 --> 00:21:38,564
tension you cannot give joy. I mean if there
is somebody tense, I think I better run away

130
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:44,644
from that person. God knows if he is tense,
if the tension increases he might beat you.

131
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:53,024
(Shri Mataji laughing) Or might throw you
out, or might himself be hurt. So, the tension

132
00:21:53,024 --> 00:22:04,183
part of it is very common in the West and
that conditioning has come because of certain

133
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:07,344
lifestyles that we have had.

134
00:22:07,344 --> 00:22:16,844
Now, there's not going to be a war of Waterloo
anymore. So, we can say that Waterloo war

135
00:22:16,844 --> 00:22:25,423
was won because they reached in time. That's
not the thing. The war was won because it

136
00:22:25,423 --> 00:22:31,074
was to be won by the Divine power. Even if
they had reached late, they would have won

137
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:42,683
it. Whatever happens is by the Divine power.
So, there is no need to be tense. Then you

138
00:22:42,683 --> 00:22:47,793
will say, "All right. Then, let us sit down
and have a nice time. Everything will be done

139
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:57,043
by the Divine power." No! Divine power is
going to work through your institutions, through

140
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:04,234
your medium. So, you have to be alert.

141
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:12,793
I hope you understand what I am trying to
say - that a person who is relaxed need not

142
00:23:12,793 --> 00:23:30,504
be a person who is lethargic, but alert. Alert
you can be as well as you can be relaxed because

143
00:23:30,504 --> 00:23:36,923
you are Sahaja Yogis. You are not like other
people. Other people, you take the name of

144
00:23:36,923 --> 00:23:42,284
the airport and I don't know what goes wrong
in their brains. Suddenly, they go off. They

145
00:23:42,284 --> 00:23:55,504
are off their heads, they go mad. Like today,
we were going to the airport. Thank God everything

146
00:23:55,504 --> 00:24:02,324
- nobody was on the road. "They must be having
these hangovers", I said, "last night. And

147
00:24:02,324 --> 00:24:10,604
today that the streets were all right." I
said, "Let's go easily. After all, there is

148
00:24:10,604 --> 00:24:11,894
no program."

149
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:18,954
At home everybody was thinking I'll be late.
I said, "I am not going to be late." We reached

150
00:24:18,954 --> 00:24:25,724
there. There was a big queue. And nobody could
get into the plane because there was such

151
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:36,303
a big queue. Nobody could even book the seat.
So, what was the need to be tense? And supposing

152
00:24:36,303 --> 00:24:46,774
you are tense, take a position. And then you
do not get the plane. So what? At the most

153
00:24:46,774 --> 00:24:54,354
only there is one mishappening, which is going
to take place, is our death. That is inevitable.

154
00:24:54,354 --> 00:25:04,134
Because we are born, so this body has to die.
That's all! The rest of it is just a joke.

155
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:12,334
So, even if you are tense or not tense makes
no difference. I think sometimes people stand

156
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:17,964
at the same point and start running thinking
they are going to the airport. (Laughter)

157
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:26,533
No movement - tense. So, first of all we have
to know that if we can reduce our tensions,

158
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:35,964
heart will open. Heart has to open. After
all, we are now in the ocean of joy and bliss.

159
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:51,064
Why should we have any tension? But when we
are in the ocean of joy and bliss, we are

160
00:25:51,064 --> 00:26:02,644
not drowning. We are swimming, so we have
to swim. And this part, I think is not understood

161
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,244
by many people.

162
00:26:04,244 --> 00:26:11,274
Now, we have conditionings of countries, of
different, different styles. Every country

163
00:26:11,274 --> 00:26:24,314
has different styles of conditionings. Let's
think of France has got conditionings that

164
00:26:24,314 --> 00:26:30,524
you should never look happy. (Laughter) You
can make out a French man. A French lady sitting

165
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:37,474
in front of Me, she was looking so miserable,
I was about to ask, "Who has died in your

166
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:48,154
family?" (Laughter) She was well dressed.
She had made all make-up, hairstyle, everything

167
00:26:48,154 --> 00:26:55,614
fine she must have been. But her face was
so miserable that I didn't understand how

168
00:26:55,614 --> 00:27:01,334
these two things combine. She has taken good
care to look, appear very nice with her paints

169
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:11,744
and all that, and here she is looking so miserable.
She's put up a show that she was very miserable.

170
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:21,933
Now, the conditioning is so stupid, so stupid
that according to them whatever is ugly has

171
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:28,624
become beautiful. The ugliest of ugly women
they'll choose and give her the first prize

172
00:27:28,624 --> 00:27:36,634
as the beautiest. I don't know for what, which
angle they saw this lady that they called

173
00:27:36,634 --> 00:27:44,394
her beauty. You'll find the lady is caught
up, she is bhootish, giving horrible vibrations

174
00:27:44,394 --> 00:27:48,564
and they say, "She is beauty."

175
00:27:48,564 --> 00:27:57,004
So, because of this tensed oblique visions
that we have either this way or this way,

176
00:27:57,004 --> 00:28:10,344
we never see the reality. And, what we accept
is absolutely whatever is unreal and worry

177
00:28:10,344 --> 00:28:20,754
about it. It's like a bubble. We are worried
about a bubble, as if it's an atomic bomb

178
00:28:20,754 --> 00:28:31,264
or hydrogen bomb. So, unimportant things we
worry so much. As a result of that, when we

179
00:28:31,264 --> 00:28:40,074
worry, worry, worry, anybody who comes near
us, we jump on that person. What are you worried

180
00:28:40,074 --> 00:28:50,303
about? What's the problem? I tell you the
only worry I have, if I have any, is this:

181
00:28:50,303 --> 00:29:06,444
that My children should love each other. So,
I talk of friendship - is to have a friend.

182
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:14,364
If we have worries, we always tell to our
friends but not to persons of acquaintance.

183
00:29:14,364 --> 00:29:20,464
If you have problems, we'll never tell it
to somebody who we just know by-the-way, but

184
00:29:20,464 --> 00:29:29,033
to our friends, and so friendship. Even if
you are a leader, you are a friend of the

185
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,454
people.

186
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:45,464
Friendship is such that you could share your
secrets, you could share your problems. You

187
00:29:45,464 --> 00:29:55,594
do that with Me. And why not with each other?
It's a question of understanding that Sahaja

188
00:29:55,594 --> 00:30:02,364
Yogis are all really friends to each other.
I think relationship of friendship is even

189
00:30:02,364 --> 00:30:07,933
higher than any other relationship we could
think of, because there is nothing to be gained

190
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:17,183
out of our friendship. It never ceases and
you just enjoy the friendship, that's all.

191
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:25,793
Then you can pull each other's legs, sometimes.
You could be little joking with another person,

192
00:30:25,793 --> 00:30:36,264
making fun of another person. It's all right,
it's friendship. But this is the purest form

193
00:30:36,264 --> 00:30:51,653
of understanding our relationships with each
other. And a friend is the one who is always,

194
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:59,283
for no rhyme and reason, concerned about his
friend. Before Sahaja Yoga, you could have

195
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:10,014
only one friend or at the most two. Three
meant a crowd, cannot have three persons as

196
00:31:10,014 --> 00:31:19,964
your friends. But in Sahaja Yoga we are all
friends, pure friendship. Friendship of a

197
00:31:19,964 --> 00:31:33,764
very beautiful nature - that you enjoy the
joy of another person. In vibrations you do.

198
00:31:33,764 --> 00:31:44,553
If you feel the vibrations of another Sahaja
Yogi, you really enjoy.

199
00:31:44,553 --> 00:31:53,944
I have seen this kind of friendship when we
were young because that time people were more

200
00:31:53,944 --> 00:32:04,364
open hearted as my father had his friends.
He was a very orthodox Brahmin, a friend of

201
00:32:04,364 --> 00:32:14,644
his and he was the chairman of an organization
all over the country. And the school that,

202
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:21,293
one of the schools where I was studying, that
organization was running. So, he was the big

203
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:30,224
boss in that school. So, My father had to
go for a case far away and he took all his

204
00:32:30,224 --> 00:32:37,394
family and he sent Me to the hostel. He wrote
to his friend that, "I'm going away and my

205
00:32:37,394 --> 00:32:43,903
daughter has to appear for her final exams.
But I'm sorry I had to go, taking my family

206
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:45,834
with me. But this is a nice chance."

207
00:32:45,834 --> 00:32:51,484
So, the friend wrote, "All right, doesn't
matter. You can go away. I'm going to look

208
00:32:51,484 --> 00:32:53,324
after your daughter."

209
00:32:53,324 --> 00:32:59,673
He came down and he stayed in the hostel.
Took a room there in the hostel. We all were

210
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:05,064
there. He was a Brahmin, he would not touch
an egg. He was a Brahmin. But he knew that

211
00:33:05,064 --> 00:33:14,694
I eat eggs and I am a non-veg. So, this was
about summertime had started. But he would

212
00:33:14,694 --> 00:33:22,564
still put on his overcoat or a raincoat and
walk out. I don't know from where he used

213
00:33:22,564 --> 00:33:30,254
to get eggs in the morning, bring it in his
room because it was a Brahmin school, and

214
00:33:30,254 --> 00:33:38,334
secretly cook the eggs for Me, and then he
would call Me, and give Me the eggs to eat.

215
00:33:38,334 --> 00:33:41,933
I said, "I don't need them." "No, no, no you
have to have. You know, Your father has gone

216
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:43,754
away, I have to look after You."

217
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:49,354
So sweetly! And he was the head of heads there,
breaking his own rules and regulations for

218
00:33:49,354 --> 00:33:54,814
Me that he was making non-veg food. (Shri
Mataji laughing) And then he would take all

219
00:33:54,814 --> 00:34:05,844
the, see, shells of the eggs in a paper, put
it in the pocket in a big overcoat, walked

220
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:14,743
out and throw them somewhere. Then he would
come with Me to leave Me for My exams. Evening

221
00:34:14,743 --> 00:34:22,873
again, he was there, waiting for Me. He was
such a big man, such a great man, very much

222
00:34:22,873 --> 00:34:28,213
respected. I mean, he was the head of the
heads.

223
00:34:28,213 --> 00:34:39,273
And everyday I was very much surprised at
this friendship. And nothing - I mean, I didn't

224
00:34:39,273 --> 00:34:50,923
see them talking about anything or I mean,
they had nothing in common as such. Was just

225
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:57,123
friendship! My father was a literary person,
as you know, and this one was a social worker.

226
00:34:57,123 --> 00:35:06,243
I mean there was, My father was busy with
politics. And such friends I have seen, My

227
00:35:06,243 --> 00:35:13,064
father would go to jail, so his friends would
come and take us away to their houses and

228
00:35:13,064 --> 00:35:16,754
their wives will look after us, give us bath.
No difference. I never felt any difference

229
00:35:16,754 --> 00:35:22,764
between their children and Me. Moreover, we
felt that they were looking after us more

230
00:35:22,764 --> 00:35:28,443
than their own children. First they will give
us bath.

231
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:38,754
In friendship one can really enjoy! You need
a very large heart to be a friend, very large

232
00:35:38,754 --> 00:35:45,133
heart. If you look after your own child, support
your own child then you are a gone case for

233
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:52,663
Sahaja Yoga, but if you have that kind of
a largeness of friendship.

234
00:35:52,663 --> 00:36:00,294
There is a nice story My father used to tell
us about friends because My brother was, had

235
00:36:00,294 --> 00:36:08,933
lots of friends, they used to go about gallivanting,
this, that. And then used to always criticize

236
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:15,243
that what father your friends come in. They
just look after your lawn sometimes because

237
00:36:15,243 --> 00:36:21,423
somebody is fond of lawn. Then another does
that. And you don't people discuss, argue

238
00:36:21,423 --> 00:36:24,863
anything - just, I don't know how you enjoy
each other's company.

239
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:32,093
He said, "No, we talk, it's not that. No,
no, we enjoy very much." So, My father told

240
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:34,613
him, "All right, I will tell you a story".

241
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:42,183
That there was a father who had a friend and
the son had a friend. Modern times, I mean

242
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:51,393
modern these days is also old times, I should
say. So, the father said to the son that,

243
00:36:51,393 --> 00:36:59,893
"You see, friendship is where you can always
rely on your friend and your friend can rely

244
00:36:59,893 --> 00:37:04,264
on you."

245
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:14,953
He said, "Really?" "Yes", he said so. "Oh,
my friends I can rely", the boy said, "I can

246
00:37:14,953 --> 00:37:19,413
rely on my friends". He said "Really?" "Yes."

247
00:37:19,413 --> 00:37:26,383
So, father said, "All right, let's test your
friends and my friends."

248
00:37:26,383 --> 00:37:35,213
So, they went down, they asked. The father
went with the son, and went to these friends

249
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:44,203
of the son. And the son thought - he told
the son that, "You have to say that I have

250
00:37:44,203 --> 00:37:50,304
murdered someone and help me." He said, "All
right".

251
00:37:50,304 --> 00:37:59,243
So, they went to one friend. That friend said,
"You murdered? Baba, you get out!" He closed

252
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:04,004
the door. Another one they went to, he closed
the door. Third one he said, "No, no don't

253
00:38:04,004 --> 00:38:09,103
say that you have come to my house. I have
nothing to do with you." All his twenty friends

254
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:09,733
said, "No".

255
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:15,804
He said, "All right, now let me go to one
friend of mine." They went there. So, they

256
00:38:15,804 --> 00:38:20,554
knocked at the door, knocked at the door.
Door would not open. Then he shouted, "I am

257
00:38:20,554 --> 00:38:25,103
here." So, the boy started saying, "Look at
this. Your friend is not even coming." He

258
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,044
said, "No, no, no, just wait and see."

259
00:38:27,044 --> 00:38:33,663
So, about ten minutes later the friend came
and opened the door, and took him inside.

260
00:38:33,663 --> 00:38:34,824
"What's the matter?"

261
00:38:34,824 --> 00:38:40,403
He said, "You know I have murdered somebody"
- the father said - "and so we have come to

262
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:41,933
you for help".

263
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:50,514
"I knew something must be there because why
will you come at this hour? So, I was collecting

264
00:38:50,514 --> 00:38:55,814
all the ornaments of my wife. I mean, if you
need money, I better give you the ornaments.

265
00:38:55,814 --> 00:38:57,504
So, that's why I was late."

266
00:38:57,504 --> 00:39:03,463
"But", he said, "if you have murdered, it
doesn't matter. Now, you've got children,

267
00:39:03,463 --> 00:39:08,284
I don't have. So, you better tell them I have
murdered. Tell me how the murder took place,

268
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:16,074
I'll take the murder upon myself." And the
son was surprised. He said, "No, take this."

269
00:39:16,074 --> 00:39:22,264
Then the father said, "See now, this is my
friend. You had twenty friends and I have

270
00:39:22,264 --> 00:39:25,703
only one friend. This is his friendship."

271
00:39:25,703 --> 00:39:30,853
And this kind of a friendship, we Sahaja Yogis
should have. I mean with a friend you cannot

272
00:39:30,853 --> 00:39:38,623
be tense. Cannot be. That is first sign. And
with your friend sitting there, you won't

273
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:43,014
doze off, and you won't sleep. But you enjoy.

274
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:53,613
Once I was traveling by train and we had two
compartments. So, in one compartment myself

275
00:39:53,613 --> 00:40:00,693
and one old lady were there. I mean, I was
older than her but she though she was older.

276
00:40:00,693 --> 00:40:09,024
And she was trying to sleep. And in the other
compartment were two friends. They had met.

277
00:40:09,024 --> 00:40:14,363
Ahh! So they were enjoying. He was hitting
him and he was hitting him. He said, "Aye,

278
00:40:14,363 --> 00:40:15,504
you!" And like that going on.

279
00:40:15,504 --> 00:40:20,314
So, this lady said, "Look at these people.
They are not allowing us to sleep." So she

280
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:25,723
went and shouted at them, "Will you stop this
nonsense? What is going on?"

281
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,733
He said, "We have met after a long time, you
see, so, we are enjoying."

282
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:32,774
She said, "This is not the way. Why are you
hitting each other if you are enjoying? And

283
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:34,473
don't talk loudly." She went away.

284
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:38,993
Then I went and said, "Now, you shout. I am
here. Don't say anything. I'll lock the door.

285
00:40:38,993 --> 00:40:43,463
This lady won't come." They were surprised.
I said, "I am enjoying the way you are enjoying

286
00:40:43,463 --> 00:40:48,433
each other." They said, "You don't want to
sleep?" "No, no, I want to hear what you say

287
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:53,083
to each other." And they were surprised how
I was enjoying the way they were hitting each

288
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:56,323
other and enjoying each other.

289
00:40:56,323 --> 00:41:05,613
So, this is how, I have to tell you that we
have to be friends. We have to share, enjoy

290
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:13,743
sharing. There is no seriousness about it.
How can you be serious with your friend? Just

291
00:41:13,743 --> 00:41:20,883
relaxed enjoying each other's company. Even
if you have to argue - argue, doesn't matter.

292
00:41:20,883 --> 00:41:29,653
Even if you have a different view, it's all
right. But, you should not try to impose yourself

293
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:34,723
on your friend, nor your friend should try
to impose. But try to understand each other.

294
00:41:34,723 --> 00:41:42,264
That's how we are going to learn such a lot.
You have to learn such a lot from each other.

295
00:41:42,264 --> 00:41:47,943
For example, I learnt so much from French
you'll be surprised. Learnt lot of things

296
00:41:47,943 --> 00:41:55,243
from French, the way they have their art,
their ideas of art, their music, their culture.

297
00:41:55,243 --> 00:42:02,583
Lots of things to be learnt. So, you have
friends in India, you have friends everywhere,

298
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:09,544
you have friends now in South America. Everywhere
you have friends. You just go ahead with My

299
00:42:09,544 --> 00:42:17,274
badge. Finished. Oh! They will all jump for
you, they will do anything for you.

300
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:26,133
So, this friendship, just think of it in this
world we have thousands and thousands of friends

301
00:42:26,133 --> 00:42:36,223
everywhere we go. And this is what we have
to know within ourselves that we have to be

302
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:46,643
ourselves very, very friendly type, very friendly.
There is an openness between one friend and

303
00:42:46,643 --> 00:42:53,483
another friend. There is no closeness. There
is no tension. There is no formality. And,

304
00:42:53,483 --> 00:43:05,024
reliance. So much so that you can talk to
them about what you want, what is your need

305
00:43:05,024 --> 00:43:10,143
and what problems you have.

306
00:43:10,143 --> 00:43:20,633
I hope you understand that love means complete
freedom to yourself and to others. If you

307
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:27,713
love someone, then there is complete freedom
and understanding. But this love has to be

308
00:43:27,713 --> 00:43:40,653
very, very pure. Complete understanding. You
have to feel that friendship. And, you will

309
00:43:40,653 --> 00:43:46,054
feel very proud that you have so many friends.
And real friends! You have so many friends

310
00:43:46,054 --> 00:44:01,393
who are real friends. You will be so very
- feeling a thing as if you are a great personality

311
00:44:01,393 --> 00:44:08,774
that you have so many friends in this world.
You are not alone.

312
00:44:08,774 --> 00:44:19,573
Imagine before this what we had, so many saints,
so many great souls were born and they were

313
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:31,903
treated like singular people and tortured,
killed, poisoned. They were alone. But you

314
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:41,583
are not. You are all - are friends to each
other and the greatest friend you have is

315
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:50,663
the Divine power, which is looking after you
and doing everything for you. If you have

316
00:44:50,663 --> 00:44:59,264
that kind of a relaxed, beautiful alertness
within you, you are going to enjoy life. You

317
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:06,373
are going to enjoy Sahaja Yoga and you are
going to get many, many more people in Sahaja

318
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:14,873
Yoga. And, if you don't have this among yourselves
then people are going to say, "Oh Mother,

319
00:45:14,873 --> 00:45:21,823
whatever You may say but Sahaja Yogis are
no good."

320
00:45:21,823 --> 00:45:32,764
So, for today, in this country of France where
we have got liberation, where we have fought

321
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:43,103
for liberation, let us take to real liberation,
the real liberation of the soul of our spirit

322
00:45:43,103 --> 00:45:50,595
to enjoy. Enjoy everything that is available
with understanding.

323
00:45:52,184 --> 00:45:55,104
May God bless you all!
