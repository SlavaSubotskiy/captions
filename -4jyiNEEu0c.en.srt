00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,857
Talk to Sahaja Yogis from Africa
Swiss Hotel, Istanbul, 23.04.2001

2
00:00:00,882 --> 00:00:03,436
This should not come (happen) to you people because

3
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:08,820
you live with the nature and
nature is not , nature is never corrupt.

4
00:00:18,994 --> 00:00:21,806
You know, every leaf, you will be amazed

5
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:26,092
which is on the tree,
 every leaf , gets the sunshine.

6
00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:39,106
Every leaf is different in the world, every leaf

7
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:42,006
and the way they organize is in such a manner,

8
00:00:42,038 --> 00:00:44,235
that all of them get the sunslight.

9
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,853
But in corruption, one wants to have all  everything

10
00:01:00,308 --> 00:01:01,688
You have...

11
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:04,641
And then,

12
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:09,860
he doesn't know what is the joy in giving to others.

13
00:01:15,932 --> 00:01:18,622
You see, that’s how it happens with Sahaja Yoga that

14
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:21,577
you become extremely generous.

15
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:30,443
I’ll give the example of my husband

16
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:32,821
or I should say of my father.

17
00:01:36,254 --> 00:01:39,813
He was a very, very generous man, very.

18
00:01:43,343 --> 00:01:46,755
And he told us not to lock the house.

19
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,980
Keep it open, no thief will come.

20
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:57,933
But one night a thief came and he took away

21
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,429
this big gramophone which had this big horn,

22
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:02,929
 and he took off.

23
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:19,677
And  the second day,
my husband, my father was got upset.

24
00:02:19,702 --> 00:02:21,753
He was little bit  upset.

25
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:29,547
So my mother said:
 “Is it because of the gramophone?”,

26
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,234
 “Is it because of the gramophone,
you are upset?”

27
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:43,588
He said, “No, we can buy

28
00:02:43,613 --> 00:02:48,259
but what about this man,
 he has taken  no records, what will  he use?”

29
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:02,779
My mother said, “Alright.”

30
00:03:03,794 --> 00:03:08,169
And he said, “He should have brought
 somebody else to take the gramophone.”

31
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:14,531
So my mother said “Alright”,

32
00:03:14,556 --> 00:03:17,621
 “What should we advertise in the newspaper?

33
00:03:17,623 --> 00:03:21,847
One who has stolen the gramophone can also take away the records.”

34
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:42,972
That kind of generosity it is, that kind.

35
00:03:42,997 --> 00:03:47,056
He said, we can afford to buy  both,
 the poor man is organiser of music,

36
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:48,716
he should have records.

37
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:02,476
Very generous, extremely generous.

38
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:11,412
So, you see, the generosity is the only way
 we can correct corruption.

39
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:23,623
When you start enjoying giving, you don’t grab.

40
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:39,871
And such a person has no reputation in the society

41
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:43,296
and that money that his  grabs, is of no use.

42
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:54,314
And all those people who have made money like that,

43
00:04:54,339 --> 00:05:00,441
have lost it when they put in this Swiss Bank.

44
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:12,723
And the swiss bank also does not away loaf it.

45
00:05:12,748 --> 00:05:15,615
They can give so much good but they don’t,

46
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:19,024
they are keeping  the money,
they are sitting on top.

47
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:29,987
So one has to, if say anything you should  talk about the Swiss bank.

48
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:34,180
Stop the Swiss bank.
 It’s cheating, complete cheating.

49
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:47,013
I don’t know how they are legalized,

50
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,190
they take money from the thieves and keep it there.

51
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:52,895
How can they do that?

52
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:08,755
If you stop the working of the Swiss bank,

53
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:11,328
I telll you the corruption will go away.

54
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:23,506
That’s the only way you can stop this high-class corruption.

55
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:36,436
You should write, you should write about it.

56
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:39,113
Americans are very careful.

57
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,677
If you send any money from America to Switzerland,

58
00:06:43,724 --> 00:06:46,994
Switzerland informs they are in legalize.

59
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:01,847
There was  in Brazil you see

60
00:07:01,872 --> 00:07:05,216
 I met  the minister of law and also

61
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:11,783
 justice, chief justice, both of them I met.

62
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:22,049
They were very respectful

63
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:27,864
but they said that in our country
 we had a prime minister who was  impeached.

64
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:41,174
 impeached.

65
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,374
And that fellow has God now a very great job

66
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:50,901
 in the University of whatever say that ...

67
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,294
Switzerland.

68
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,916
No, no, no , in the America

69
00:07:55,941 --> 00:08:01,215
Harvard, Harvard University;but  teaching Economic  [UNCLEAR].

70
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:20,957
He was impeached.

71
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:31,614
All kinds of  thieves will be now going to these bigger universities,

72
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,448
 and they will teach our children how to cheat.

73
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:45,888
That’s what it  is coming.

74
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:54,111
I spoke about it in China, when  they had this women conference that called.

75
00:09:01,994 --> 00:09:05,481
But I don’t know, this is a big game going on.

76
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:19,351
It’s a thing to be seen from Sahaja.

77
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:31,298
If we don't workout, I'm sure will be better it

78
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:39,446
Because it’s a woman global work, global.

79
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:45,402
So, it can not fail.

80
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:52,136
Because  the power of the collective.

81
00:09:58,086 --> 00:10:01,609
I wish you could have a conference one day,

82
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:05,031
of  all these people  in India or may be new country.

83
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:06,523
Guido: Yes Shri Mataji

84
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:11,139
You should go once and a new  big conference there.
