1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,800
[...] is very money oriented

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,960
and sometimes it becomes very crude also about it.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,920
Like I went to Boston and

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:27,480
there they asked me a question, how many Rolls Royces She has.

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,480
[...], how many Rolls Royces, just think of that.

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,960
I did not what to say.

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,680
[...]

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,840
[...]

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,480
Yes, they have gone through Yog, good idea, started with Yog.

10
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,520
I addressed them, when I was in New York

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,720
They will be very happy to have another program with me.

12
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,400
But I told them where Jung went wrong

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,400
and why couldn’t  achieve much in his lifetime.

14
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:40,480
But, the people are, at large, very stupid in America.

15
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,520
Extremely stupid, I mean they...

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,920
I talked to them about [...] and all the mistakes

17
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,960
he must have committed and..., well deep subject.

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,760
Then the chairman, an old man of 80 years,

19
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,560
wanted to see Me personally.

20
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,080
I said, alright, he came along

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,200
and then what he says to me, most surprisingly.

22
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,760
He says he has a keep, and he had this keep for many years.

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,040
He?, he this gentleman.

24
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,280
He never told his wife and now the wife is dead.

25
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,040
Now, this keep is still not so old as I am,

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,160
and now she wants to go away with another man.

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,760
That’s his problem, and how can I help him.

28
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,760
And, what to do I said.

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,760
80 year old man.

30
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,080
How far could [...] or what to do with him.

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,520
Such a stupid question from an 80 year old man [...]

32
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,840
I said, Sir I’m sorry, can’t help you.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,480
Really, what a question to ask.

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,000
That he had a keep and the keep is leaving him,

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,120
and his wife is dead now and he never told his wife.

36
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,720
I said, such a stupid thing for an 80 year old man to say.

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,960
When he went away, I was laughing and laughing,

38
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,280
they say, why are you laughing? I said, now what should I do,

39
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,280
you see, this gentleman comes to me serious, very serious chairman.

40
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,760
I couldn’t keep my seriousness.

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,240
[...]

42
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:32,200
In, Rome

43
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,040
or in Milano they started calling me,

44
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,960
the great mother, the grandeur. [...] Yes.

45
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,720
There, it’s tremendous.

46
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,840
Very well done, this should attract their attention.

47
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,960
But, I mean, for Americans I don’t know how you should start.

48
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,560
From their keeps onwards, I don’t know...

49
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,960
What they think of Jung here?

50
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,840
I don’t know, not, I think there is, I think a small society, but

51
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,440
i don’t know if they are very strong or not.

52
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,840
Shri Mataji, the Jungians made a date Theosophical Society.

53
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,440
They mated the Theosophical Society.

54
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,760
So i don’t think there is many of them,

55
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,440
i don’t think they have their own

56
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,360
rooms as such, must be a small group.

57
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,840
This Theosophical Society, [...]

58
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,000
But you haven’t given the places where She will be,

59
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,760
and that will be in the newspaper I think.

60
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,480
Yes, this was the poster we handed with it, Shri Mataji.

61
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:51,800
Good, very straight forward, very straight forward.

62
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,800
That will appeal to Australians, because Australians are

63
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,920
very straight forward people.

64
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,440
Written, "elusive union", elusive, elusive is the word?

65
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,360
That, "still see that elusive union", OK?

66
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,800
Elusive, elusive means, hard to grasp.

67
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,640
Its a "e", [Hindi? Ne], is it with an "e"?, "elusive"?,

68
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,200
[Hindi?...] "e" is it with an "e"?,  yes yes.

69
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,440
[...] Its difficult to get to, difficult to grasp.

70
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,320
Till now use it, till now, till now.

71
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:23,360
Elusive means [Hindi...]

72
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,880
This one, is very [...], I mean, you have written so much,

73
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,520
that to digest is going to be difficult.

74
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,600
But, one point could have been that,

75
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,680
this is the age of our ascent, age of ascent.

76
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,160
This is the age of our ascent, is our evolution.

77
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,120
See, that sounds very scientific also,

78
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,600
Because we have reached the human stage,

79
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,960
than we have to ascend after that.

80
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,400
And what is, there must be something.

81
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,720
So, is one of those things that may appeal to the scientist,

82
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,480
lets point.

83
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,400
Done so well, who is this one, Stan Bostoc?

84
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,360
[...], he doesn’t exist.

85
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,800
It was written by Brian Bell

86
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,120
This gentleman came to see Me?

87
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,960
No, no, it’s made up Shri Mataji, to get the press interested.

88
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,880
He’s done it, Mister and Brian Bell has not been into my house.

89
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,920
How has he described it so well?

90
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,960
Brian Bell, Shri Mataji, and Ian Hanky made the story up.

91
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,600
Ah!

92
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,400
In America somewhere it’s to hard to check, so it’s..., helps.

93
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,800
He never came to London, did he?

94
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,800
Brian Bell did, i think, OK no, Brian Bell?

95
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,120
I think he has been. The press, the press like the article very much.

96
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,400
I think he has been to [...].

97
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:54,200
Brian Bell has been to London. [...]

98
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,160
All this you have given?

99
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,560
Yes Shri Mataji.

100
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,920
Poor things, they must be already having [...] casualty.

101
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,960
It has affect on them, they said it.

102
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,160
It has affect on them Shri Mataji, they...

103
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,120
Mean what?

104
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,960
This has an affect on the reporters, they can be very crooked.

105
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,480
So, this is what achieve the TV interview.

106
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,480
Means what?

107
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,400
This, this press key, plus we had a small video

108
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,640
[...] interview in England.

109
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,720
I think about Cambridge, Hm, Cambridge color vision interview.

110
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,840
Yes, who is given to the journalist.

111
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,840
Cambridge one, yes.

112
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,360
Was that? You where walking with a reporter, lady reporter

113
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:24,120
No, no a Sahaja Yogi from Cambridge, [...]

114
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,800
Jim, a Sahaja Yogi in Cambridge. Jim yes,yes.

115
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,400
You where walking with him and the television.

116
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,000
He came to see Me.

117
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,920
You gave realisation to a lady in a park.

118
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,800
Cambridge television.

119
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,160
I don’t remember.

120
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,840
[...]

121
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,720
No, there was one thing that happened,

122
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,480
That happened in that place Middlesbrough,

123
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,680
is that the name of the place, Middlesbrough? Yes.

124
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,520
You see, there the journalist came and they said:

125
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,920
Now supposing, who is sick and cannot come to you,

126
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,880
what can you do for that person.

127
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,640
No, not that one. That one was interesting.

128
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,960
So the brought Me, I said than let me have the photograph of the lady.

129
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,840
They said, she is the one she cannot get out of her house,

130
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,960
and she is suffering from a disease,

131
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,120
that she doesn’t want to meet anyone, she doesn’t want to go out.

132
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,800
I said alright, let Me see.

133
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,800
So I took the photograph in my hand

134
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,480
and just gave a bandhan, that’s all, looked at it.

135
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,400
And I was amazed that,

136
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,920
I told them, don’t worry now for some time, wait for 8 days.

137
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,600
But I was amazed the way they where in a [...].

138
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,000
So they went to, after all that, they went to see her.

139
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,960
And they found that she had gone out with her husband

140
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,600
on the [...] for a walk, you see, that one worked.

141
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,520
But I don’t remember the Cambridge fellow.

142
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,480
At the end of the interview you told people

143
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,720
to put their hands to the television set.

144
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,840
What happened?, I can’t hear.

145
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,080
At the end of the interview on the tape,

146
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,600
that we gave the channel 7,

147
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,040
You asked the people to hold their hands towards the television set

148
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,440
Alright, to feel the cool.

149
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,840
And then they felt the cool breeze? Yes, Shri Mataji. Really? Yes.

150
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,200
And the reporter,

151
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,840
What will I do with my ears,

152
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,480
just now they are not alright with them [...]

153
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,360
[...]

154
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,440
I’m tired. North America.

155
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,400
That’s the story of North America.

156
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,800
After a big lecture we give, yes.

157
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,480
I giving them such a detailed description, ah terrible.

158
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,680
I mean, mental level is, I don’t know what happens,

159
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,160
the caliber is, just stupid people.

160
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,360
That all sick, sick people, sick.

161
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,520
[...]

162
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,760
So we can invent stories and things, but main thing is,

163
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,640
to reach this people.

164
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,440
What is the best way, should find out.

165
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,440
If they are seekers, if they are true seekers,

166
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,560
what is the best way of reaching them.

167
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:16,920
Lets just find out, what is their problem.

168
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,320
After all, why are they misbehaving and not coming to Sahaja Yoga.

169
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,240
Shri Mataji we having [...]

170
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,840
I use this machine, because it’s so much of,

171
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,320
this traveling has made my ears absolute, you see, wobbly.

172
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,440
Can hear at time, at the time I don’t, let’s see if it’s working.

173
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,680
So funny thing.

174
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,040
How much traveling I have done, it’s been to much.

175
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,320
[...]

176
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,080
Done by one doctor, so the doctor has to put it.

177
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,520
Just trying on the right ear more, not so much in the left.

178
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Now? Now [...]

179
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:18,120

180
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,400
[...]

181
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,160
Its better, slightly better.

182
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,000
[...]

183
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,440
This is the better ear. [...]

184
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,480
Try in this one, see, this is meant for this ear.

185
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,800
My one ear is alright according,

186
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,960
[...]

187
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:52,120
[...]

188
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,480
Try again, ha.

189
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,040
Something funny.

190
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,680
The amount of traveling I have done,

191
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,920
you will be really surprised.

192
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:20,720
Even you did not do with this st buses, it was so much.

193
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,800

194
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,920

195
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:40,000
Its a little funny [...]

196
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,880
They said you have to put it underneath this ear here.

197
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,880
First of all and then push it back.

198
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,120
First you have to push it underneath this and then push it back.

199
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,280
You have to push it underneath this, first of all.

200
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,440
Underneath that, ha?

201
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,960
[...]

202
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,200
Now, [...]

203
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,280
Is it better?, horrible.

204
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,960
First you travel, then you loose you hearing,

205
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,240
then you push this in your ears.

206
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:32,400
Its a vicious circle. You have taken all that in that tape, good.

207
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,560
So now nobody will trouble me with traveling.

208
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,280
That cannot be avoided.

209
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,480
[...]

210
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,760
Shri Mataji, we have been receiving lots of fan post,

211
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,400
people inquiring about the public program.

212
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,320
You had lots of them? Oh I see.

213
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:05,800
So we’ll have a big... turn out, I hope so.

214
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,040
What, this is what you should not feel disappointed.

215
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,400
When I am there you’ll find crowds, always.

216
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,640
It happens also in London, you’ll be surprised.

217
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,440
This time in London I could not walk through.

218
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,120
It was such a crowd.

219
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,800
Half where standing outside, they couldn’t even hear me.

220
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,760
But, next time they had the meeting,

221
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,840
only 30 people arrived.

222
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,240
And [...] was sitting like this, what to do.

223
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,600
They just want to hear me, all the time.

224
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,200
But at least, you have here ashram.

225
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,120
They don’t have an ashram until the shuddy camp is done.

226
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,760
There is going to be a big problem and

227
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,640
till then, they are going to have a big problem,

228
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,280
getting people around.

229
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,440
Maybe with shuddy camp I’ll do it [...]

230
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,320
With the shuddy camp thing they might work out better.

231
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,240
If shuddy camp works out in that way.

232
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,040
[...]

233
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,480
Its a very short one I think, David Spiro has given us.

234
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,760
[...]

235
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,320
[...]

236
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,240
[...]

237
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,400
[...]

238
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,800
[...]

239
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,360
[...]

240
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
[...]

241
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,280
Perfect now.

242
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,640
Better, I hope so. I hope so.

243
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,160
Otherwise I will ask them to shout at me.

244
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,840
It’s better to confess.

245
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,920
But, you see the traveling was like so continuous you see,

246
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
continuous traveling.

247
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:40,120
And also, keeping awake in the night was,

248
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,080
too much, everyday, everyday.

249
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:53,480
Australia has done very well in Sahaja Yoga, Yoga, I must say.

250
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,560
Has done well. On the whole, if you see. On the whole.

251
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,240
Only problem comes in with a,

252
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,600
with the government and all those things, you see.

253
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,440
Like in Rome the government has accepted.

254
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,200
Is that... They are helping me.

255
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,480
They paid for the posters, didn’t they in Rome? Paid for the posters.

256
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,760
Lots of proposals,

257
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,680
and that helping them a lot.

258
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,120
So, there are people very constructive by nature.

259
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,080
First I went to Rome,

260
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,960
it was in a very bad condition.

261
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,880
The economy had gone down and people did not what to do,

262
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:56,280
what to make and how to rise, big problem.

263
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,000
I said, it’s alright it will work out

264
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,920
let Sahaja Yoga be settled down,

265
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,960
then Sahaja Yoga started settling down.

266
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,080
But I told them, why not people make things which are not

267
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,760
easily made in other places, handmade things,

268
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,960
like tiles and things like that.

269
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,560
And now it’s prosper

270
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,920
Everywhere you go, into any shop, say in Belgium

271
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,120
or in France, anywhere.

272
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,080
It’s only Italian goods you see,

273
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,720
only Italian goods.

274
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,560
Surprising they do printing, also you have ties,

275
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,080
you have clothes, everything from there.

276
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,120
Handmade woods, handmade woods Shri Mataji, all handmade.

277
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,400
That’s the thing, they took to handmade.

278
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,880
Because they are very good at..., very good at.

279
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:53,360
Furniture they make, beautiful furniture, at a very cheap price.

280
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,880
Very beautiful furniture, in labour an all that,

281
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,160
and they are doing so well.

282
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,400
While, what we are doing is

283
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,800
going in one line only.

284
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,160
Now, produce with machinery,

285
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,480
[...] people are feed up.

286
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,320
They don’t want to have anything of machinery.

287
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,040
Now you can’t get anything here, now cotton is so expensive.

288
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,400
Anything natural is so expensive.

289
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,680
So, specially in England

290
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,800
you can’t get cotton clothes even for children.

291
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,920
I think we have trouble here getting some cotton clothes, don’t we?

292
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:41,040
They come from India, don’t they? cotton clothes? ...

293
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:47,160
I can’t here him still well, better try on this ear, maybe.

294
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,760
I can hear, but not so well as I should hear.

295
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,360
Mind me.

296
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,280
[...]

297
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,360
[...]

298
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,200
It’s to much of vibrations, you see, in the ear [...].

299
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:24,720
So difficult, takes about a day to settle down.

300
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,560
After Puja Shri Mataji, or after traveling.

301
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,920
And more with the car journey I get, get  more with the car journey.

302
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,840
The whole day today We are traveling, you see.

303
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,920
Whole day Shri Mataji, oh yes, whole day.

304
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,720
[...]

305
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,560
[...]

306
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,960
[...]

307
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,240
[...]

308
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,720
Such vibrations, they couldn’t hold my feet

309
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,280
Now, what are you doing, better stop.

310
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,720
All operation stopped,

311
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,480
because they will be upset, you see,  to see.

312
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,160
Can we open [...], what is your crusade.

313
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,760
What is?, your crusade, crusade.

314
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,520
Crusade?, purpose, crusade, purpose.

315
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,680
[...] , what is your crusade.

316
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,680
Crusade, but there is no crusade at all.

317
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,680
But what you can call it, is a movement.

318
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,800
You see, crusade is rather sharp, isn’t it?

319
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,800
It reminds me of the war of the roses, crusade.

320
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,720
Or i think, well, my definition of crusade is, it means that,

321
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,840
spiritual revolution, yeah, i know

322
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,920
[...] to some kind of motivation all through, Yeah.

323
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:22,440
No, it’s a movement, it’s a movement, is a,

324
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:29,720
the movement is, this is,

325
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,840
a evolutionary time.

326
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,440
This time is, people are not aware of it,

327
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:40,200
but is indicated in many scriptures.

328
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,320
That this modern times, people will be

329
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:53,640
so fed up, that they will ascend.

330
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:00,640
They will ascend to a higher awareness, yes.

331
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:06,480
And I am quite aware of that, that those times are here

332
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,600
and they have to ascend

333
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,760
Now, only thing I have done is,

334
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,240
of course i knew, how one can ascend.

335
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:23,960
That there is an energy within us, which is a residual energy,

336
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,040
which is called as Kundalini.

337
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,160
A very ancient science,

338
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,320
but also is used in the Bible,

339
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:38,520
as said that, I will appear before you like tongues of flames.

340
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,960
Also Christ has promised to send the Holy Ghost.

341
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:49,920
The Holy Ghost reflected within us, is the Kundalini.

342
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,320
People don’t know about Holy ghost, what is this Holy Ghost.

343
00:46:53,560 --> 00:47:01,560
But that’s the energy and that’s the energy of Gods desire.

344
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,920
So it’s a pure energy, pure desire within us.

345
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,080
And this is the desire, unless and until it is fulfilled,

346
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,000
we cannot be satisfied with any other desire.

347
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,800
All other desires are useless,

348
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,080
because we want a car, then we want a house, they want this,

349
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,400
we are never satisfied. The reason is, that’s not a pure desire.

350
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,880
Now this resides in the triangular bone within us.

351
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,760
What you call the Sacrum, see the word Sacrum itself means sacred.

352
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:41,320
This Greeks must be knowing the word, so they call it Sacrum.

353
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,520
So this rises, awakened,

354
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,520
It rises like a [...] in a seed,

355
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,200
and pierces through 6 centers,

356
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,760
which are placed in medulla oblongata,

357
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,520
in the back part of our head.

358
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,320
And then, ultimately through the limbic area

359
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,240
it pierces through the fontanelle bone area.

360
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,040
And then, you get a cool breeze coming out of your own head.

361
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,800
You feel very relaxed and thoughtless.

362
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,640
Now the question [..], in all [...] to east and west civilization is,

363
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,320
is the western civilization enslaved by the mammon?

364
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,160
And if you don’t  know what mammon is, it’s a god of materialism.

365
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,480
What’s it?

366
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:45,400
Is the west enslaved by materialism?

367
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:50,400
He’s asking, is the west enslaved by materialism, Shri Mataji.

368
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:55,120
Is the west enslaved by materialism.

369
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:59,360
Makes a god of Materialism, has it made a god of materialism.

370
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:05,280
Yes that’s very true, they are going towards materialism.

371
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,880
But they are realizing that’s not the right path.

372
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,440
They are realizing slowly, you see.

373
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,640
Say you started with plastics,

374
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,520
now you know how horrible this plastics is.

375
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,560
You started with other artificial things,

376
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,760
and you found out they where no good for your body.

377
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:32,760
Then even your live style, when you try to have

378
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,320
this kind of artificial relationships,

379
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,720
you found out it did not work out.

380
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,280
Nature took this respite.

381
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:49,720
So, going to unnatural things doesn’t give you

382
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,400
any good results.

383
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:59,600
Now the Spirit is always trying to fight the matter.

384
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,880
All the time, the Spirit is fighting the matter,

385
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:07,800
is trying to rise above the matter.

386
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:14,440
Like supposing, we are used to something, we cannot give it up.

387
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,240
Any habit formation is coming from the matter.

388
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,120
There is, at the same time

389
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,720
when people are taking to materialism, at the same time

390
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,600
there are many people who are thinking,

391
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,160
that there must be something beyond it.

392
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,280
Is it something beyond materialism. What that?

393
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,120
Is there something beyond materialism.

394
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,320
Is there something beyond materialism.

395
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,400
Of course, much much more.

396
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:02,360
And you see, actually materialism is going down, down the line.

397
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:09,080
Everything is upside down, that is materialism.

398
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:16,800
An upward movement, which is toward the Spirit,

399
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,840
takes you to reality.

400
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,880
What is reality,

401
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:30,200
is that you are the spirit, not the matter.

402
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,560
What sort of [...] of advice or help can you give Australian

403
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,120
to our [...] materialism, who are involved in,

404
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,520
or should we they obsessed with

405
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,600
that [...], their videos [...]

406
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,520
What sort of advice would you

407
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,480
like to give to Australians, who are so much

408
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,040
bound by their materialism, by their cars, by there videos,

409
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,160
[...]

410
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:06,480
[...]

411
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:15,360
It’s very simple, as soon as they become the Spirit,

412
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,960
they give up all these things overnight, you’ll be surprised.

413
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,480
We had drug addicts, in London,

414
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:30,080
who came in a condition, we can call it as a coma condition, see.

415
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:36,720
Horribly addicted to drugs, overnight they gave up, overnight.

416
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,840
Because Spirit is the power.

417
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,800
No matter can overpower a person who is spiritual,

418
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,920
in the real sense of the word.

419
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,600
They just give up.

420
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:56,160
So many Australians we have now here, it must be at least, how many?

421
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,680
Oh, there was 400 odd, 400 odd and that was not all of them.

422
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,440
They are the people who are practicing, practicing Sahaj,

423
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,120
but otherwise we have many more, who just given up

424
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,160
all these habits.

425
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,760
I don’t tell them anything.

426
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,360
I don’t say, don’t do it, because half of them would run away.

427
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:19,440
But it happens, and when it happens, then they just give up.

428
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,640
Alright, how do we become the Spirit?

429
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:28,440
As I told you, that there is this power within you,

430
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,280
which is to be awakened.

431
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,960
I can awaken your power, he can awaken,

432
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,880
all of them can awaken.

433
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,920
I mean, once they get the light, they can do it.

434
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:45,360
They become a powerful personality, nothing can dominate you,

435
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,320
you do not dominate anyone.

436
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,480
You are no more a reactionist,

437
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,880
but you are very substantial.

438
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,120
You see, these days people are just reactionist,

439
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:05,320
they are nothing themselves.

440
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:13,440
And you can feel

441
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:18,840
the divine power,

442
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,960
within and without, you can feel it.

443
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,600
It’s like a cool breeze in the hands,

444
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,320
you can feel it which surrounds us.

445
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,520
What inspires you personally to spread,

446
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:41,560
[...]

447
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,240
Sorry, sorry, i was asking, what inspires you personally to,

448
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,400
What inspires you personally to come out and

449
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,320
do this, he said, was the question?

450
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:58,880
So satisfied, once you get it, you will also do the same.

451
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:03,960
It’s like saving people from getting drowned.

452
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,840
Materialism is destructive,

453
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,560
it will destroy human beings.

454
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,280
This one is the constructive work.

455
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,760
You construct good families, good children,

456
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,720
good people, honest, honorable,

457
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,440
virtuous, righteous.

458
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:35,920
These qualities shine trough your personality.

459
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,400
Want you have a cup of tea [...], where will you keep.

460
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,760
Ha, the table [...]

461
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,600
Tell me what is the secret the selfrealisation.

462
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,640
What is the secret of the selfrealisation.

463
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,320
Secret is that,

464
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,280
now, no more a secret.

465
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,840
The secret is no more a secret.

466
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:30,600
Is a simple thing, that within you, is the, power lies.

467
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,280
Somebody who is authorized, by the divine,

468
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,200
is not that a church, or a temple, or a mosque

469
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,800
they cannot authorize.

470
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,680
The authority cast must come from the divine.

471
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,600
And a person who has that divine authority,

472
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,920
can give selfrealisation.

473
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,440
What would you say to people,

474
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,960
for say, Australians [...]

475
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,960
I’m dragging this personally, since Australians, but how,

476
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,760
how can they help for saving those Australians,

477
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,720
who wake up feeling sorry for themselves each day,

478
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:25,640
who have no feel no, further so well in life itself.

479
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,480
He is asking, how can this help Australians,

480
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,120
who wake up in the morning

481
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,600
feeling sorry for themselves, so not having anything to,

482
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,440
inferiority, any purpose,

483
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,560
or any purpose in their lives.

484
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,800
They wake up feeling that they have no purpose, how can this help.

485
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,120
Yes, that’s what they feel

486
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:49,560
But you see, once you become realized soul,

487
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:55,000
you start working for god.

488
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:02,440
You have powers to awaken others.

489
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:08,520
You have powers to cure others.

490
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:16,840
And, you have powers to express yourself.

491
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,600
And I would say, the greatest power a human being gets,

492
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:32,000
is the collective consciousness.

493
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,800
Can you explain this enlightened state

494
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,640
that life being struck by a lightning bolt, or what?

495
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,720
He’s asking, could you please explain it, is it like being

496
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,080
trucked by a lightning bolt, or what, could you please explain,

497
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,560
that is what he’s asking. What lightning?

498
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,320
Then it takes, for the Kundalini to rise, little bit.

499
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:57,200
Sometimes some people do feel, tickling in the hands,

500
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,600
before feeling the cool breeze.

501
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,480
That suggests that there is something wrong on their centers,

502
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,760
that’s all.

503
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,320
These, all these pictures they have given,

504
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,880
or whatever they have written about Kundalini, is all false.

505
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,280
Because they where not authorized.

506
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,200
You see, a person, who doesn’t know about electricity,

507
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,280
puts his hands in the plugs

508
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,520
and says that, i got a shock.

509
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,800
That means he doesn’t know the job, you see.

510
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,720
They are not authorized, you have to have

511
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,960
a person who is authorized by divine.

512
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,680
You must have also a character and a caliber.

513
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:41,960
Not only that, but a life which is pure.

514
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,040
There is

515
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,880
no hypocracy in Sahaja Yoga, no no hypocracy.

516
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,600
Because whatever you do,

517
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,680
whatever you say, is the same.

518
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:05,680
There is no hypocracy. As soon as you try to become, say,

519
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:10,960
hypocritical some times, then you loose your vibrations.

520
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,040
It’s automatic, I don’t do it, it’s automatically.

521
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,320
And you don’t what to loose them.

522
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,480
Because all the well being is finished.

523
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,680
Is any after life reward for this [...],

524
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,360
[...] conscience.

525
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:35,080
He’s asking, is any after life reward for this state.

526
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,920
Many, after all you see,

527
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,800
but may you say after life in the sense, or after dead.

528
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,160
Yes, you mean after death, hm.

529
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,760
You see, first of all,

530
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,640
when you are not a realized soul,

531
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,680
we have no decision power.

532
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,240
When to be born, how to be born, to whom to be born.

533
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,760
We have no decision, no direction.

534
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:12,960
Then when, if you are a realized soul,

535
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,640
like many children in Sahaja Yoga are realized souls, born.

536
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,120
Many great people are born.

537
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,680
They have chosen their parents, who are realized souls.

538
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,640
They are very beautiful children,

539
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,560
and very sweet children.

540
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,200
Very well behaved and very intelligent.

541
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,280
They top the race everywhere, get all the prices, no problems.

542
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,280
Just going back to the question about

543
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,960
the afterlife do exist, there is an energy.

544
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,040
A positive energy or a negative energy?

545
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:02,400
But, after life you mean after death, after death.

546
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,800
[...]

547
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,720
You talk about the present, what is after death why are you worried.

548
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,920
[...]

549
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:15,320
What is he?, It’s a big question seems to found everywhere.

550
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,800
It’s a big question what happens after death,

551
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,280
that seems to haunt a lot of people.

552
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,960
And so do, how do we exist after death was his first question.

553
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:28,640
Oh, I see, anyone isn’t it. Yes anyone. You mean anyone?

554
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:32,280
So when people die, you see as I told you.

555
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,240
There are people who are mediocre, you see.

556
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:42,040
They just live like, you should say, ordinary people

557
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:47,960
with insurances, this, that and then they die.

558
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:54,800
Such people, when they die,

559
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,600
their soul remains.

560
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,720
In the sense,

561
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,480
the Kundalini and the Spirit

562
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,480
remains.

563
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:12,640
Plus, there are 4 elements within us.

564
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:17,040
The essence of that remains with the soul, 4 elements.

565
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,720
The earth element drops out.

566
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:25,880
So these 4 elements, the essence of that,

567
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:30,480
they remain with the soul.

568
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:35,600
Now, if they mediocre, they just hang around you see,

569
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,080
if they are attached to a wife, or this and that,

570
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:43,520
they may possess also.

571
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:57,000
They go into our collective subconscious area.

572
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,360
Most of them.

573
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:02,280
And are born again,

574
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,280
without any choice.

575
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,320
But some of them, later on,

576
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:16,200
say, if there is a politician who is very ambitious

577
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,920
and he doesn’t want to die very soon,

578
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:26,160
and he has to die, goes out of grace, by something.

579
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,920
Then he is born again, in a way,

580
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:34,760
that he possesses another politician.

581
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,640
and for the time being, that politician appears to be a very

582
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,240
smart fellow, you see.

583
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:48,040
As if he is giving some good,

584
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,600
advices and good proposals.

585
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:55,560
But after some time he’s becoming absolutely useless.

586
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:02,200
They become very ambitious, arrogant,

587
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:09,840
and we can say, devoid of all collective feelings.

588
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,840
They don’t worry about public

589
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:15,760
they are only worried about their own ideas.

590
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:23,680
But such politicians after some time are exposed.

591
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,280
To public, or they themselves feel sick,

592
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,600
and that’s how they [...], that’s their situation.

593
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,040
Do you expect for the corrupt ones, have to come back in the next life.

594
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,800
Sorry, do you expect for the corrupt politicians have to come back

595
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,680
to justify their past [...].

596
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:50,760
He’s asking do very corrupt politicians,

597
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,200
they get reborn again as,

598
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,240
in a man at, so it’s to justify their past lives.

599
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,880
No, they have first of all possessed someone.

600
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,120
They try their hands on some other corrupt ones, you see.

601
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:07,760
That’s how we are getting corrupter and corrupter , you see.

602
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,880
First there where not such corrupt politicians.

603
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,320
Now we find they have becoming more corrupt.

604
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:19,120
Then, the reason is the very corrupt ones, you see,

605
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:24,560
actually are added up by these corrupt ones.

606
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,960
They give them strength.

607
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,280
So these politicians become extremely corrupt

608
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,360
and they are not at all aware

609
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:44,080
that by doing such a thing,

610
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,320
we will be all finished and ousted.

611
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:52,200
Also these

612
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,080
dead ones, the entities give them ideas,

613
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,800
how to hide their malpractices.

614
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,640
Will be possible then,

615
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,800
just judging by your argument that say many ultimate,

616
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,840
sort of able politician arrow people,

617
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,880
absolute direct it all, or had some [...]

618
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,880
[...] leader.

619
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:26,320
Was, is it possible then that, was Adolf Hitler was he

620
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:30,160
possessed by some other being, or,

621
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,960
Rather after he died.

622
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,760
or could he, after he died, Of course he could,  possess someone?

623
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:40,520
He could, he could, but he has to have a strong personality

624
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,720
to possess, you see, he was a horrid devil.

625
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:03,120
Do you know who the premier of Queensland is?

626
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,760
Do you know who the prime minister of Queensland is, the premier.

627
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,880
The premier, premier, of where?, of Queensland. I don’t know.

628
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:18,560
It’s a man from the [...]

629
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,640
He has [...] inspired people by his leadership.

630
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,720
[...]

631
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,640
[...] What did he say.

632
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,720
He said, he hasn’t people inspired by his leadership.

633
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,600
This premier of Queensland.

634
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,080
Some may say, he’s turning a state into a mini dictatorship.

635
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,480
Would it be possible that he, He’s turning into?, dictatorship.

636
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,040
Ha, a mini dictatorship is what he has...

637
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,120
You see, I would not say about one particular one. OK.

638
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,920
That will be this thing. But all those,

639
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:59,000
who become like that, should know, that they are being possessed.

640
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,240
And they have to be careful.

641
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,920
You see, once you start doing such a thing

642
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,880
then they can be possessed.

643
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:20,840
If you try to do something which is not publicly good,

644
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,240
and something you become arbitrary, you can call the word arbitrary

645
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:27,680
is better, you see, arbitrary.

646
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,320
Then somebody can jump on them, you see,

647
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,080
waiting for such a character.

648
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:39,080
But I would not say about anyone particular,  in particular.

649
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:45,160
But there are some,

650
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:49,880
realized soul, who can become prime ministers

651
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,440
and can do a lot of good.

652
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,160
If they take up a prime minister ship.

653
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:01,200
But normally they are not so much interested in politics.

654
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,680
That’s the trouble with them.

655
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:11,800
Can these spirits, he’s a bound spirit, come out and cease to exist.

656
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,160
[...]

657
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:18,000
Which the spirit sort of people, who are dead,

658
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:23,440
How?, I’m sorry what was the question?

659
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,560
Can they cease to exist.

660
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:32,440
How can these, or can these spirits cease to exist.

661
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,240
Yes they can,

662
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:40,760
they can cease to exist if you do not use this black magics

663
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,240
and all these false gurus

664
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:49,520
and all kind of this money makers, in the name of god.

665
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,520
It depends on what you want.

666
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:57,320
If the public wants

667
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,720
people who make money in the name of god,

668
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,760
in the name of religion,

669
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,920
even in the name of yoga.

670
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:19,280
Then they exist, because these people use these spirits only

671
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,920
to befool.

672
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,960
[...] by Your past,

673
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:32,280
the past definition that someone who,

674
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,760
someone say, politician for example who draw,

675
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,240
who draw that to the negative,

676
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,120
draw that to the negative spirit or energy.

677
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,160
[...]

678
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:46,040
They use them, as what She explained, they can use them.

679
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:50,400
He’s asking that, can even politician use

680
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,200
such type of negative spirits.

681
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:56,160
Of course they do, they want it.

682
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:01,360
Most of the politicians and also you can say bureaucrats,

683
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,080
are more interested by these things.

684
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,280
Than by a thing that is pure and simple.

685
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,720
they are more interested.

686
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:15,480
Because you see, what they want, say they want a higher power,

687
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:19,640
they want to oust someone, they want to defeat someone,

688
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:23,160
so they use these people.

689
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,200
I’m sorry can You just clarify,

690
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,960
is it the case of the spirit using the

691
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,080
the person, the flesh or is it the

692
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,880
or is it the flesh using the spirit.

693
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:39,280
He’s asking that, is it the question of the

694
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,880
flesh using the spirit, or the

695
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:47,080
people who are, the dead spirits in this, using the people.

696
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:52,640
Because earlier You had mentioned something about the person,

697
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,520
the [...] and getting into the politician or so on.

698
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,200
They get in and do they also use them, this is the question.

699
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,600
Yes, yes, they do, they do.

700
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:08,520
You see now, do you know who was the guru of Hitler.

701
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:14,080
Lama, he was a Lama, a Tibetan Lama.

702
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:19,160
This, same Lamas forefather.

703
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,280
I’m sorry, Dalai Lama.

704
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,120
Dalai Lama was the guru of Adolf Hitler.

705
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,520
The guru, ah the guru yes, is like a teacher,

706
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,280
or a mentor, teacher.

707
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:36,520
Which Dalai Lama, not, a Lama.

708
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:40,120
What are the Lamas. No, no Dalai Lama himself, not this one.

709
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,480
His forefathers, the one before, at a time whosoever it was.

710
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:44,880
Maybe his grandfather,

711
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,080
because they have no fathers or anything, you see.

712
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:52,080
They are picked up from here and there, like that.

713
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,920
He was his guru.

714
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,080
[...]

715
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,960
Spiritual guru.

716
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:02,840
He was a spiritual guru, he had Dalai Lama.

717
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,400
[...]

718
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,360
Not this Dalai Lama,

719
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:14,040
at that tine Hitler had another Dalai Lams, who was his guru.

720
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:19,200
[...], this is a response to your question,

721
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,600
could Hitler have used these spirits,

722
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,920
and he had learned all this from the Lamas.

723
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,960
And also the dead bodies,

724
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:32,320
they use dead bodies, those people who practice this

725
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,000
kind of a black magic, they use dead bodies.

726
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,600
Supposing an evil genius dies, you see,

727
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:43,800
they get after that and they try to get his skull, or something.

728
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:49,520
Just to overpower him and they use him.

729
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,760
Did you follow.

730
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,360
Supposing an evil genius dies, yeah, alright.

731
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,720
Some evil genius dies, alright.

732
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:02,120
So these people come to know that somebody has died like that.

733
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,680
So they’ll get after that body,

734
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,920
follow that body, is an ancient knowledge in our country,

735
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,800
this is nothing new I’m telling you, we know all these things.

736
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,840
That’s why we are out of it.

737
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,160
They go, follow that body and get hold of the skull of that body.

738
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:22,520
Because we burn the bodies, you see.

739
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,200
And then use the, use see bind that fellow,

740
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:33,320
enslave that evil genius and use him for torturing others.

741
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,240
This is a very old knowledge of our country.

742
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,520
Everyone knows about this knowledge,

743
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,400
and they know what this people do,

744
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,960
so nobody likes to go near them, very few.

745
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,840
But the modern people, you see, who have had modern education,

746
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:57,840
they have no idea, so they go to these people.

747
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,320
In our country also, in Delhi if you see,

748
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,120
there are lots of these people.

749
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,840
Like in Canberra as I came, I said, terrible.

750
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:10,120
In Canberra there must be many.

751
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:14,440
Because My left side was caught up, I couldn’t even walk.

752
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,400
Horrible people must be there in Canberra sitting down,

753
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:20,440
doing this kind of work.

754
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,240
But i think anyone what [...] the point [...]

755
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,080
He agrees with you.

756
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:29,240
Oh, I tell you, really. I mean, I couldn’t walk.

757
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:33,080
I couldn’t walk one step forward.

758
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,520
He doesn’t know Shri Mataji, sensitivity to vibrations.

759
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,760
Whenever there is power, they are settled there,

760
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,960
and they befool these people, these bureaucrats,

761
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,920
or these politicians, these people.

762
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,560
Just to wound up, a very enlightening interview can this, beg pardon,

763
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,360
just to wound up to end a very enlightening interview,

764
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,840
can I ask you, do you have a message for the world.

765
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:01,360
Do you have a message for the world.

766
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:12,120
The message is, that, take to reality.

767
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,800
Take to reality, that’s what it is.

768
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,840
One has to take to reality.

769
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:29,520
Seek the reality, and nothing artificial.

770
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:39,560
Nothing superficial and wrong ideas.

771
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:17,440
These powers are within you, they are all there.

772
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,320
You have to just get it, that’s all, don’t pay for it,

773
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,560
you can’t pay for it.

774
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:22,760
In answer to your question,

775
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,280
yes, you're respectable whether you are a christian or not.

776
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:28,600
No,...

777
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:29,560
I’m just trying to...

778
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,240
You want to know, whether even if you're a christian,

779
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:39,240
whether you can still be possessed, or you get into these things.

780
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:43,160
He is going back to the middle of the interview,

781
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,960
he wants to know that if you're a christian,

782
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:50,680
means you go to church, or you have been confirmed, or whatever,

783
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,320
can you still be affected by these dead spirits.

784
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,440
By all means, you are not connected with god.

785
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,880
You are not connected with god,

786
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:02,880
Christians mean, doesn’t mean, that you are, you are one with god.

787
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:07,440
You have to be connected, that’s what Christ has said.

788
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,440
You have to be connected, isn’t it.

789
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:12,040
He said you have to be born again.

790
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:16,000
You see, we just put a certificate, i'm a christian, so what.

791
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,680
God doesn’t know that.

792
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,800
He has said it in the second chapter Mathews, he said.

793
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,200
In the second chapter in the second verse.

794
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,120
You will be calling me Christ, Christ, I will not know you.

795
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,240
That’s really, he has said, he said it in many ways.

796
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:32,800
That Christianity doesn’t lay in, going to the church, at all.

797
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,960
It lies in, becoming connected with god.

798
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:39,080
Shri Mataji is born christian.

799
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,960
Shri Mataji was born christian, She comes from a christian family.

800
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,680
So many Christians doing this work.

801
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,120
Charismatic movement is what.

802
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,280
This seven, or what you call that.

803
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:54,200
Pentecostals, this one, same thing, possession.

804
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:59,080
Pentecostal have you seen, people, Pentecostals. Yes, yes.

805
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,840
That’s all possession, yes, yes.

806
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,360
Charismatic movement, is all possession.

807
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,320
I find it difficult, to deal with them,

808
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,240
they are terrible, they shake before me.

809
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:12,960
So, how can it be.

810
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:18,400
Christianity can only be achieved, when you are connected with god.

811
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,600
Islam, Mohammed Sahib has said it clearly,

812
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,640
that you should be connected with god,

813
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,080
then only you can surrender.

814
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:29,760
There’s no connection yet established.

815
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,840
But you can profess a connection, can’t you.

816
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,960
You can say, you are connected.

817
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:39,000
What you mean, already you can be connected or just be saying it.

818
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,320
I can tell you i am connected,

819
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,480
just to impress you Shri Mataji.

820
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,560
Yes, he is saying that,

821
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:51,040
supposing I want to impress you, I can say I'm connected to god.

822
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,160
That is not saying, you get powers.

823
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,880
You see, somebody, somebody says i'm now a twice born.

824
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:01,200
Alright, you put a certificate there, so you are not.

825
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,520
You see, supposing you are a governor,

826
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:06,680
supposing you say i am the governor of this place,

827
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,320
then you have powers of a governor, isn't it.

828
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,720
You must have the powers,

829
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,360
if you don't have the powers, you cannot raise the Kundalini,

830
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,600
you cannot give self realisation,

831
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,560
you cannot feel collective consciousness,

832
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,560
you cannot feel all-pervading power,

833
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,680
you cannot cure people, how are you, a twice born.

834
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,040
Just a false certificate.

835
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:33,920
That's why there has been problem.

836
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:38,400
We are dealing with falsehood, not with reality.

837
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,320
You see the point.

838
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,280
Among Christians also, how many churches,

839
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,680
how many fights, how many arguments.

840
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,760
Now recently, it was that with mafia,

841
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,040
and with Vatican and with, what, the Swiss Banks,

842
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,720
and Swiss Banks, are one. Is a connection between.

843
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:14,200
What do you say to that, this is horrifying.

844
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:19,720
And if you see the Iraqi and these other Arabs fighting,

845
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,160
how do you explain.

846
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,880
Yes and the, the...

847
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,600
That's why the young people have no respect for god,

848
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,840
no respect for religion, logically.

849
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:35,160
But, there is god, there is god.

850
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,920
We must proof it now,

851
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:41,640
the time has come to proof the existence of god.

852
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,560
Hitler called him as a very big christian himself.

853
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,000
You don't know that, he used to call himself as a big christian,

854
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:59,760
and he protected all the christian churches in Germany.

855
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,120
He could manage.

856
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:04,120
Didn't he close down the churches [...]

857
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,400
No, he didn't close, he supported all the nuns,

858
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,120
he supported all the churches,

859
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:12,960
everything, he called himself as a christian.

860
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,240
And he was a vegetarian, on top of that,

861
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:21,560
what is it, strict vegetarian.

862
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,320
Only believed in killing people in gas chambers, that's all.

863
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,120
Horrible thing.

864
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,920
All those who go to church, how much they achieved.

865
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,600
How much of righteousness of Christ,

866
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,280
how much his goodness, nothing.

867
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,920
Why , why it has failed.

868
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:50,280
Because without connection with god, you cannot.

869
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:54,400
You cannot understand religion, you cannot understand Christ.

870
01:23:54,640 --> 01:24:00,960
What we do so to, to try and form a connection, [...] we.

871
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,440
What he say, can we, do go to church,

872
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:08,120
to try and form a connection with god.

873
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,640
You see, the trouble is the one who gives you the connection,

874
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:13,200
has not authority.

875
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:19,040
You see, it must come, the authority, must come from god.

876
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:22,840
Those people have no, you are all simple people who go there,

877
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,880
you see, I see them, because I come from christian family myself.

878
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:29,960
There are all simple people who go to church, thinking that,

879
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:33,480
we are in connection with god, but no

880
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:39,640
The person in charge there is a paid employee

881
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,680
So, we got it all wrong.

882
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,800
He wants to know, whether we have got it all wrong.

883
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,800
Have we got it all wrong.

884
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:55,120
In a way and in a way not, because I will fulfill all the promises.

885
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:58,000
That of that I’m sure, all the Christians,

886
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,480
they can be fulfilled with their promises.

887
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:03,800
Because they have loved God, they have loved Christ.

888
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,640
All of them, all those who have loved Christ,

889
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:10,280
will get their promises fulfilled.

890
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,480
With or without the connection.

891
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,360
You’ll just now get it.

892
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,360
Is such a [...],

893
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,560
You can't help without the connection to God,

894
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:22,040
but Shri Mataji says that, you will have it.

895
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,880
You get the connection, If you loved Christ,

896
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,160
If you love Christ, you will have it.

897
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,280
If you have loved Christ, you'll get it.

898
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:31,160
[...] of course. Is it nice doing here.

899
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:36,080
She asked you also, if you would like to have it here.

900
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,120
I love those, who love Christ. He said yes.

901
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,840
[...]

902
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,840
Is not only in the churches, in all the religions

903
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,880
it is going on like this.

904
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:51,840
This priesthood has nothing to do with god,

905
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:55,400
has nothing to do with god, that's the problem is.

906
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:58,120
Some of them maybe good, I'm not saying all of them are like that.

907
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,200
But goodness is not sufficient, they should to have power,

908
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,120
to connect you with god.

909
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,560
She ask you, whether you would like to do.

910
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:12,080
I give you just now. I think in my own way, i...

911
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:14,840
You get it just now, put your hands towards me, just like this,

912
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,520
and you'll get it, the cool breeze.

913
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,600
You take out your shoes, that's all.

914
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,920
You can, just one minute, you will get the cool breeze in no time.

915
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,560
If you have loved Christ, you will get it.

916
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,760
Cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

917
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:37,040
You all should feel it, now put your hands towards me.

918
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:42,280
A simple man and why shouldn't you get. Put your hands like this.

919
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:47,320
He's got it. Just see on his head.

920
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:56,200
You feeling the cool breeze in your hand, the sensation.

921
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,360
I think so.

922
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,520
Is there, on your head it is there.

923
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:03,800
Just come out, see now, see for it.

924
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,480
You are absolutely thoughtless now,

925
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:08,640
you are watching me without thoughts.

926
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:15,760
But all the Christians must learn this point, that's all.

927
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,280
They are not gone wrong, they have loved Christ.

928
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,360
Ha, good.

929
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:24,360
Feeling better now, just put your hands here and  see for yourself.

930
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,560
Little higher.

931
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:29,520
I think so.

932
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,880
There, is there. Let's have it also you come along.

933
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,840
Then you know better to write.

934
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:40,440
Please take out your shoes for one minute, you can get it in no time.

935
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:44,840
Ha, see you better now, much better.

936
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,400
[...]

937
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:53,480
Please put both the feet.

938
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:55,920
[...]

939
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:11,360
Nabhi blocked, nabhi, liver otherwise.

940
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,640
Are you feeling any cool breeze,

941
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,320
I'm feeling relaxed, but not feel  any cool breeze.

942
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:25,760
Just  watch Me here, just watch me here,

943
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:30,280
and forgive. Forgive everyone, you have to forgive.

944
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,200
Just say in your heart, that i forgive everyone,

945
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,000
alright, just say that.

946
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:53,320
You see, your world is such, that you have to be little futuristic.

947
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,720
That's why there's a little imbalance, that's all.

948
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,280
Which I'm correcting.

949
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:04,880
Is better, yes this, right vishuddi [...]

950
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:08,200
What's wrong. Just right here, because you talk,

951
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,040
you see, and all that, you have to talk all the time.

952
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:17,360
That's why this is a little bit, put both the feet on the ground.

953
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:28,800
Left nabhi is, yeah, the heart Shri Mataji.

954
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:35,920
[...], is better.

955
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,960
Now, there is no thought in your mind.

956
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:49,080
Is there any thought, let's see. You are thoughtless,

957
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:53,880
absolutely, you got it. Feeling anything in the hand.

958
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:57,560
I feel [...] in my hands.

959
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,360
What are you feeling.

960
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,440
I'm feeling nothing. A sensation.

961
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:15,280
A sensation is [...] nothing, sensation, not yet.

962
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:26,400
Now better, is good now.

963
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:32,040
Cool breeze, or not yet, alright.

964
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,080
You have to forgive, you see, this is the center of Christ.

965
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:39,560
At this center you have to forgive. Now, You don't do that.

966
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,720
He's feeling nervous this gentleman.

967
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:49,800
[...] You are married? No. Not yet.

968
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,720
You want to marry? No. Is a trouble.

969
01:30:55,960 --> 01:31:01,920
[...] not to marry, that's what it is catching.

970
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:09,280
You have to marry Sir, is important.

971
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,000
[...]

972
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:26,760
[...]

973
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:32,960
[...]

974
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:43,560
Better now.

975
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,960
[...], Hm?, Sushumna doesn't open.

976
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,720
Sushumna. [...]

977
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:05,720
You have to ask me, [...] for self realisation,

978
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,200
cannot be forced, alright, I cannot force it on you.

979
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:12,000
You have to ask for it, just ask for it.

980
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:18,120
[...] my self realisation.

981
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,080
So important.

982
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:49,680
[...]

983
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:54,160
You worked very hard Sir, shouldn't work that hard.

984
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,600
[...]

985
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:06,200
Just say, I'm the spirit, in your heart. Say that I'm the spirit.

986
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:10,560
[...] Say, I'm the spirit.

987
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:17,920
Just again say, I'm the spirit. Just again say, I'm the spirit.

988
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,120
Now better.

989
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,760
Heart be catching.

990
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:47,920
[...], Vishuddi, [...]

991
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:20,160
So much heat coming out. Now better? Perspiration is better? Yes.

992
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,960
We work on your heart.

993
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:38,800
Better now. [...]

994
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:43,480
You shouldn't have worked so hard.

995
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:52,480
He himself is a doctor.

996
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:57,520
And a psychiatrist.

997
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:02,880
Now, is a combination of left and right, both of that.

998
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:06,600
[...] Left and right combination, Shri Mataji.

999
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,240
It moves between one and the other.

1000
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:15,800
[...]

1001
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:26,280
The Agnya, Agnya, come on, now, now it's coming.

1002
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:33,080
You want come, feel it? Convince yourself.

1003
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:37,400
Feel the cool coming out on top of his head now.

1004
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:42,160
Feel it, it's there. Now you feel it on your left?

1005
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:56,600
You think to much, don't think, don't think.

1006
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:09,240
We didn't do any wrong, you see,

1007
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:14,200
you love Christ and you got it.

1008
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:18,680
He has promised this. [...]

1009
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:27,320
[...] Is a boy [...] Try.

1010
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:32,080
[...]

1011
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:35,880
[...]

1012
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:40,960
So cool, [...], what innocent, simple head.

1013
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:45,840
[...] should have it, how are you now, you get it.

1014
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:50,200
Eyes are black like mine. Not yet, in the hands is lightly.

1015
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:54,600
Your heart is very [...]

1016
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,160
Better now.

1017
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:22,520
[...]

1018
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:27,520
[...]

1019
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:34,880
Now better relaxed? You are relaxed, alright.

1020
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:37,200
But what your hands. [...]

1021
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:41,920
Not alright, are you feeling any cool breeze? Not yet.

1022
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,600
Can't cool down, perspiration has gone?

1023
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:07,200
Now better.

1024
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:15,200
Alright, take this water, this will cool you down, your stomach.

1025
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:18,080
Special liver is there.

1026
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,280
Au, [...] terrible liver,

1027
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,280
you could see his skin is all [...] also.

1028
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,200
[...]

1029
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:52,400
You have to just ask, you have to ask,

1030
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:56,040
Shri Mataji who you, let me feel the breeze.

1031
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:58,960
Whatever you like. But only thing is his,

1032
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,640
this liver is very bad.

1033
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:09,080
Also Vishuddi, ha, now better, better, the liver is released.

1034
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:13,160
[...]

1035
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:18,360
Goes up to the heart, liver heat.

1036
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:24,640
You are not married, then you are your mother, father?

1037
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:29,560
Live alone? Yea [...]. Just imagine, that's why.

1038
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:36,320
Now.

1039
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:50,200
Ha, is better. You feel it here, this?

1040
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:53,160
[...]

1041
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:56,040
Please take the water, please.

1042
01:39:57,040 --> 01:40:00,640
[...] Here it is coming, cool breeze,

1043
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:04,000
[...]

1044
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:07,440
but in the hands, because of this center, is very hot.

1045
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:11,400
This center is just like stone.

1046
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,960
[...]

1047
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:21,320
Feel it?

1048
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:27,200
Move it like this and you will see it.

1049
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:30,280
I think so, yes.

1050
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:36,960
[...]

1051
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:42,400
It goes back you see, comes up here and goes back to liver.

1052
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:46,200
Now, what is it, you say.

1053
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,200
[...]

1054
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:50,800
[...]

1055
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:53,640
[...]

1056
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:59,360
Nabhi, he will marry later on.

1057
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:04,640
Alright, come along, drink that water.

1058
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:10,880
All the Australians have bad livers, that's one thing, very common.

1059
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:16,280
Sun, sun, too much sun.

1060
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,880
Thinking to much.

1061
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:27,760
Better [...], now he is thoughtless, [...]

1062
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:33,480
What about in your hands, feeling it? Some sort of a breeze?

1063
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,160
Dead, no, not.

1064
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:47,680
[...]

1065
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:50,760
Hands are white Shri Mataji, the hands are white.

1066
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:55,240
Alright I [...]

1067
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:00,480
Relax.

1068
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,400
Left and right, both are catching.

1069
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,640
So it catch hold of this, both sides.

1070
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:12,520
[...]

1071
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:22,920
[...] swadisthana, hot, hot, very hot.

1072
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:29,160
You feel very hot all the time, [...]

1073
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,240
[...] most of the time, Ha?

1074
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:35,880
Most of the time. The skin, the skin is some much heated up.

1075
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:40,480
You sit in the sun? Sometimes.

1076
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:48,280
Oh, too much, too much sun is not good.

1077
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:53,920
That creates terrible problems.

1078
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,920
See the heat, oh the ears, everything is heated up.

1079
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:11,040
Swadisthana is there.

1080
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:17,640
[...]

1081
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:26,440
You have liver too?

1082
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:30,400
Put left hand, left hand on the liver, right hand towards me, yes.

1083
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:32,280
Better now?

1084
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:39,040
How you’re feeling, relaxed? Yes. Cooler? Feel you cooler or not.

1085
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:43,400
Still not feel it, to much heat. Better now, now, hands are cool.

1086
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:48,280
Hands are definitely cool now, must say. So now let's see.

1087
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,400
You must give it liver treatment.

1088
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:02,320
Very simple, you take it for 2 days, this heat will go away,

1089
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:05,280
you fell very much better. [...]

1090
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:07,960
You have got it now, we can feel it on your head.

1091
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:10,920
It's coming out, but in your hands I think it's not there because of

1092
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:16,080
the heat of the liver. Liver is very much heated up, is better now.

1093
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:20,960
[...]

1094
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:24,360
Feel better?

1095
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:33,440
Better now.

1096
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:39,560
[...]

1097
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:44,440
It goes back to here, to Agnya now. To where? Agnya.

1098
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:54,560
Alright, [...], there are just, just [...] it off, it will work out.

1099
01:44:56,280 --> 01:45:00,720
[...], cool down, very much cool down, let's see.

1100
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:06,680
[...]

1101
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:17,400
It's better Agnya, Hamsa [...]

1102
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:38,960
Alright, better now?

1103
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:44,560
Feeling any cool in the hand? Not yet, nothing.

1104
01:45:46,680 --> 01:45:49,880
Alright, put your hands up in the air, and just ask a question.

1105
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:52,440
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy ghost,

1106
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,600
just ask the question to Me.

1107
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:57,280
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

1108
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:59,160
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

1109
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:01,360
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

1110
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:04,840
Ha, let's see, now?

1111
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:12,480
Is it? No. Don't doubt yourself, you don't doubt yourself.

1112
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:17,640
You don't doubt, you’re doubting yourself.

1113
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:20,040
You cool down very much, his face, look at him.

1114
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:23,120
All the redness has gone, it's much cooler.

1115
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:26,400
No? Nothing.

1116
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:32,200
You been to any one of these people who teach and talk about,

1117
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,920
dead things and all that?

1118
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:40,160
No, sure [...] been. Know, you are catching on that chakra.

1119
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:44,320
To someone, you been to someone who is

1120
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:48,160
doing this kind of magic and all that. No.

1121
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,640
I've been to archive, went to a false guru, yeah I'm.

1122
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:55,680
I'm not personally myself, but i witnessed a few people who've been.

1123
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,960
You been reading about it.

1124
01:46:58,160 --> 01:47:01,200
Who? He has witnessed it, seen something.

1125
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,440
[...]

1126
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:09,480
What did you see? I saw,

1127
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:12,880
I've seen a few people who've been

1128
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:16,760
absorbed by false gurus and who've [...]. [...]

1129
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:21,880
What did you see, you just tell him.

1130
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:25,440
He seen some people who've been to false gurus, Shri Mataji.

1131
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:28,760
Interviewed them, you seen them how they have suffered?

1132
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:35,600
No, not how they suffered, but in therapy in some kind of treatment.

1133
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,840
He seen them in some sort of a treatment,

1134
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:40,560
in therapy or whatever they do.

1135
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:43,720
Whatever they do together.

1136
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,320
They worked on you also? No, but I've seen someone

1137
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:50,800
who's in my family, have a treatment and this [...].

1138
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:53,880
Have been. He has seen someone in his family

1139
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,040
have this treatment, he observed it. I see.

1140
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:59,520
I see. Of the false gurus.

1141
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:02,040
And they suffered, or what?

1142
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:09,080
Financially, Financially,...

1143
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:11,720
That's the first, that's the first one.

1144
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:16,360
How much money you have in your purse, is the point.

1145
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,520
You have, Rustum what you say?

1146
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:22,480
Still on the Vishuddi, Vishuddi, Left Nabhi

1147
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:27,080
is quite strong Shri Mataji, [ [INAUDIBLE] and Left Swadisthana.

1148
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:29,960
Left Nabhi comes from Left Swadisthana.

1149
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:33,640
It should work out, actually his Vishuddi is

1150
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:37,120
not so bad as his Nabhi is. Yes, Nabhi is very bad.

1151
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:39,960
Somebody has told you that you have a liver problem, or no?

1152
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:43,000
Not as yet. Not yet.

1153
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:46,840
According to us, your liver is very heated up, alright.

1154
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:49,960
And you have to cool it down. Because of that,

1155
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:53,080
you have so much of heat in the body, too much heat.

1156
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:56,200
Heat is not a good thing, is not a constructive thing.

1157
01:48:56,400 --> 01:49:01,920
And when the heat of the thing starts melting, I mean other things,

1158
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:04,880
you get all kinds of complications from the liver.

1159
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:08,880
So, there was perspiration, because it

1160
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:11,960
also affects the heart. It [GOES, MOVES?] the heat.

1161
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:15,280
You see, makes the heart pump more and into problem.

1162
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:18,160
And these are all things connected with the liver.

1163
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:21,160
Of course, treatment to liver takes, doesn't take much time.

1164
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,200
It takes very hardly 2-3 days,

1165
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:26,400
but you better take your treatment of liver, is very important.

1166
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:30,360
Because if the liver goes out, everything light becomes miserable.

1167
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:35,200
You cannot concentrate on anything and you feel like vomiting,

1168
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:38,280
you don't feel like eating food and all things happen.

1169
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:46,120
And sometimes you feel also giddy and can go into another kind of a,

1170
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:49,080
what you call, perversion of the thing.

1171
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,280
Can become very serious matter.

1172
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:55,360
So, right now the best thing is for you to get your liver done.

1173
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:57,920
Though you have got cool breeze on your head, we can feel it.

1174
01:49:58,160 --> 01:50:00,560
Left hand, [INDIAN WORDS]

1175
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:03,000
let us see if you can feel on top of your head.

1176
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:05,480
With your left hand, just see.

1177
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,080
Do you feel anything?

1178
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:12,520
[INAUDIBLE] feel not anything. No?

1179
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:14,240
Can't feel it, so, its alright.

1180
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:18,040
The feelings are according to the nerves, you see, that are there.

1181
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:20,920
Now what has happened is, that your Vishuddi, this center,

1182
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:23,920
is also,  because you talk too much with people, you have to talk

1183
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:27,240
with them and all kinds of people you have to talk to.

1184
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:31,200
So your right Vishuddi is catching, that is this center is catching.

1185
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:34,880
That's why the feeling is less, but it is there, he has [...] it.

1186
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:38,480
And is there and you are feeling relaxed, now you will sleep well,

1187
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:42,400
And if you can come sometime,

1188
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,440
I'll treat your liver perfectly alright.

1189
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:47,480
You must take treatment of your liver, alright?

1190
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:50,440
But Australia is known for liver, bad liver.

1191
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:53,520
Australia and France, experts on liver treatment.

1192
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:56,880
I think they drink and sit in the sun.

1193
01:50:57,080 --> 01:51:01,560
All that is necessary to spoil the liver, they think too much.

1194
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:03,560
Australians also think too much,

1195
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:05,960
that's why their liver is not alright.

1196
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:09,720
But now you are not feeling better in any way?

1197
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:12,720
It is more relaxed. Are you feeling relaxed?

1198
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:15,840
[Acha?] now, are you also feeling cool down?

1199
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:21,960
Cool and [...]. Feel your hands. Feel cool?

1200
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:26,000
Hands are cool now, cooler? Better.

1201
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:29,160
I mean there is a trouble that's what is to be cured, you see

1202
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:31,720
and has to be done, which will work out.

1203
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:35,040
So, any time whenever you are coming we'll work it out,

1204
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:38,720
I will get you alright as far as that is concerned.

1205
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:41,480
And then you will be surprised, that

1206
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:43,360
your dynamism will be so great.

1207
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:46,280
Not that in your work, but you'll never be tired,

1208
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:48,600
you never have this kind of complications,

1209
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,560
you will work as much as you like,

1210
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:53,440
it will be a witness state in which you will be.

1211
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:57,480
So you will never think about it and you will be very dynamic

1212
01:51:57,680 --> 01:51:59,960
and very successful.

1213
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:04,000
But that has to work out, should not just left to be be half done.

1214
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:07,640
Alright you understand. You also come along, establish yourself

1215
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:10,200
and now give realisation to other Christians.

1216
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,600
Who are poor thing going to the church all the time,

1217
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,640
morning til evening and receiving nothing.

1218
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:21,680
What are they receive? What have they got?

1219
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:27,400
So you will be the real Christian. You can cure people.

1220
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:30,120
You can have the knowledge, everybody knows what's wrong with it,

1221
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:33,280
on the fingertips.

1222
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:40,240
On the fingertips, that's what it is reality.

1223
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:42,080
You have to feel it on your fingertips,

1224
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:46,000
til you feel it they'll be after you. They are all perfectionists.

1225
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:49,360
Because now you have to go, its alright, but you come next day,

1226
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:53,920
you come next to that, they'll work it hard and make you perfect.

1227
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:59,680
Alright, may God bless you, may God bless you.

1228
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:04,520
Thank you very much. May God bless you. Enjoy yourself. Thank you.

1229
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:13,480
All the journalist have this problem, you know you are another one.

1230
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:16,960
[...], most of them.

1231
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:19,800
Their right Vishuddi always catching, they talk too much,

1232
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,720
even the teachers have the same problem.

1233
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:26,720
Its alright, when you come next, we'll put you right.

1234
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:33,520
But now give a little constructive report about us.

1235
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:36,240
So that we are helpful to people, you know this.

1236
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:39,200
Only we need you for this kind of thing,

1237
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:42,080
that you have to give them the right correct thing.

1238
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:45,480
That see, don't go to false gurus, don't pay them money.

1239
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:50,280
Don't do all these things, wasteful things, take to your own style

1240
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:53,880
which is within yourself, just get your own powers.

1241
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:58,640
You don' have to go to somebody for that, just within you it lies.

1242
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:00,840
And how can you pay, God doesn't understand money.

1243
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:05,040
Does he understand money? No.

1244
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:09,200
God doesn't understand money. How can you pay for God?

1245
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:14,920
First thing, the one who says: "I need money for this", then cancel.

1246
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:18,680
So many will be canceled like this.

1247
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:23,680
You can't pay for God.

1248
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:27,120
Its alright, I mean now I'm staying with them,

1249
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:31,600
they are looking after me, give me food and all that, that's all.

1250
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:36,480
My I'm no expense otherwise.

1251
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:41,720
When they come to my house, I look after them too.

1252
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:44,680
Ha, thank you very much, very nice meeting you.

1253
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:48,640
Oh, now it's cool and nice.

1254
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:53,800
Alright, may God bless you. Thank you very much.  May God bless you.

1255
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:57,360
So, hope to see you some time for your liver trouble.

1256
01:54:57,560 --> 01:55:00,840
We give you a prescription and you will be cured, alright.

1257
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:03,320
Will take no time for you to get cured.

1258
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:07,720
All of them had liver, all Australian Sahaja Yogis.

1259
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:12,120
May God bless you. Thank you very much.

1260
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:14,600
He has been to the false gurus, so he will know now

1261
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:16,760
the value of Sahaja Yoga.

1262
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:23,960
[INDIAN ...]

1263
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:32,080
He saw some relatives of his, go to some kind of a collective,

1264
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:37,240
some sort of a therapy, with some such false

1265
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:41,960
therapists [...]. I think he has seen something horrible.

1266
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:47,200
TM, i don't think it's TM, i think he has seen some [...]

1267
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:49,480
I think its TM. I think he has seen,

1268
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:52,720
or he has seen something horrible.

1269
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:58,720
And he also said his,  that relative of his lost out financially.

1270
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:01,640
[INDIAN ...]

1271
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:04,400
[INDIAN ...]

1272
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:08,640
[INDIAN ...]

1273
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:11,080
[INDIAN ...]

1274
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:14,640
Bhagwan is beyond all this, God is beyond any formal...

1275
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:18,080
I'm taking you to God. First give me your purse, you see,

1276
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:23,200
God doesn't understand money, better give me.

1277
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:25,920
That's the logic.

1278
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:32,920
When he was asking you about

1279
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:36,360
all that spirits and after dead and so on,

1280
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:41,960
[INDIAN ...]

1281
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:46,640
[...] was going up and down, he was asking me about spirits.

1282
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:49,240
So many questions.

1283
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:55,040
He asked if they can possess the politicians, I said: "Yes they can".

1284
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:59,760
He said that Queensland, Queensland Prime Minister

1285
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:03,000
is becoming like a dictator. Yes.

1286
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:07,560
Do you think he is possessed. I said: "I can't say what one possess"

1287
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:09,360
I don't.

1288
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:26,920
Queenslanders have the highest rate of skin cancer, Shri Mataji.

1289
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:31,400
Queenslanders have the highest rate of skin cancer in the world.

1290
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:36,520
[INDIAN...] Rajeesh. What does he?

1291
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:39,600
Queenslanders have the highest rate of skin cancer in the world.

1292
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:42,080
[...]

1293
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:46,480
What he said? He said in Queensland, this is the state of Queensland

1294
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:47,600
Really!?

1295
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:51,360
We are in Queensland now, that's why he was asking about Queensland.

1296
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:55,600
Is the capital, right? Brisbane,  Brisbane is the capital

1297
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:57,360
of Queensland.

1298
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:01,120
And he said they have very high rate, or highest rate in Australia

1299
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:06,640
of skin cancer. [INAUDIBLE]

1300
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:10,760
In the world, the highest rate in the world. Highest rate? Yes.

1301
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:13,640
Of skin cancer. And also suicide I have heard. Oh.

1302
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:17,120
Canberra, that's in Canberra.

1303
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:21,840
But this one is definitely out for a skin.

1304
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:27,080
Already started it, the spots, you can see spots already.

1305
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:31,960
Skin [...]. He's out for a skin troubles.

1306
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:36,880
I told him in a way, whom did he go to.

1307
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:42,040
Coming, [...]. He didn't remember the name.

1308
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:44,560
He said, he didn't remember the name of the people,

1309
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:46,720
but it was a Sydney based group

1310
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:51,520
and they used to involve going into past live times. Oh yeah.

1311
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:54,720
What he's saying? He's saying he doesn't remember who he went to.

1312
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:58,320
It was a [...] it was not TM.

1313
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:02,200
But it was a group there is based in Sidney.

1314
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:07,360
And they go into the past lives of the people and

1315
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:08,920
means all this what You was talking about.

1316
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:12,680
It's probably this [...] therapy You were reading about today.

1317
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:22,400
I told him not to talk about the dead, they're wanted to know.

1318
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:23,760
But I told him, doesn't matter.

1319
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:27,160
I told him this is all old knowledge to us.

1320
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:38,440
Its alright, he was quite impressed at it. I think so.

1321
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:42,360
What did he say? Shri Mataji i told him to look in the mirror,

1322
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:44,080
i told him his face looks different

1323
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:47,720
and his friend said, "Yes it does".

1324
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:51,560
He said, "Your complexion is better and your eyes look different".

1325
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:53,400
So i told him to look in the mirror.

1326
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:56,680
You see this skin trouble as he say it's skin cancer,

1327
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:59,360
definitely [...].

1328
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:11,360
They want to sit in the sun, oh yes, that must be the.

1329
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:15,440
Madness.

1330
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:22,560
I really don't.

1331
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:29,040
They say, that a mad dog and an English man...

1332
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:34,480
But the Americans are worse than English.

1333
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:42,240
Shri Mataji would you like dinner now?

1334
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:45,280
Alright I'll have dinner now.

1335
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:49,240
I worry I can't hear much today.

1336
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:52,200
Tomorrow I'll be alright.

1337
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:59,120
We all have dinner now?

1338
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:04,960
[...]
