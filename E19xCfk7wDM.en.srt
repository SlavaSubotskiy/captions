1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,310
So one would say that why Shiva, like a birthday 
of Shiva you can say or something, how can

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,320
it be, because He is eternal, He is all the 
time there.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:22,850
So what demarcates today's celebration, is 
the establishment of Shiva on this earth.

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,630
In the material self.

5
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:37,159
Every matter has been created with a deity 
and that deity is established in that matter

6
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:42,039
as you know.

7
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:52,539
So when it was thought by Adi Shakti that 
first you must establish Shiva, without Shiva

8
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,140
you cannot establish anything.

9
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,329
First He is to be established, because He 
is the absolute.

10
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:03,609
So you have to establish Shiva, and now what 
should we do?

11
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:04,609
How to establish Him?

12
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:05,609
He is the God of Tamo Guna.

13
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:22,180
He is the cold, he is the God of all that 
is not active.

14
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:35,010
So first of all this earth when it receded 
from the sun which was very hot was taken

15
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,340
very near to the moon.

16
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,630
The moon is the brother-in-law of Shiva.

17
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:53,140
So it was taken so close to moon that the 
whole earth got covered with ice.

18
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,760
And it was then gradually moved towards the 
sun.

19
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:05,730
When it was moved towards the sun, gradually 
then it started melting.

20
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:12,630
And the point that did not melt at all was 
the point where Shiva was to be established.

21
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:18,920
That was -- and is still that spot, and that 
spot is the Kailash.

22
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:32,690
The ice never melts there and if you see the 
whole mountain is like the face of Shiva -- the

23
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:41,300
eyes, the nose and everything you can see 
clearly getting out -- and all the year round

24
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:57,160
it keeps its shape as it is.

25
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,500
That is how Shiva was created, and He was 
placed in a witness state, as a spectator

26
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:08,760
of all that happens on this earth.

27
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,900
Facing towards the Kundalini of the universe, 
which they were going to place in India, so

28
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,620
He is facing towards the South.

29
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:31,239
He is looking at the South with both the hands 
like this, like a spectator watching the spectacle

30
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,540
of the Adi Kundalini.

31
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,880
That is how Shiva was created.

32
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:57,620
So, so we'll say that the heart of the universe 
is England, still Shiva resides on top of

33
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:04,000
the Sahasrara: this is the seat.

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,640
Like you have got the seat of Shiva on top 
of your head, but He resides in your heart,

35
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:18,069
in the same way Shiva belongs to this place 
and He looks at the whole body from that,

36
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:26,860
this point -- so the Feet are the South, this 
(top of head) is the North, this is the East...

37
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:38,340
the West (right arm), and this is the East 
(left arm).

38
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:45,870
That is how we can see the whole map of the 
universe, of the world that is created.

39
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,220
So now...

40
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,919
[You can just sit.

41
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,480
Don't stand up.

42
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
Listen to My lecture.

43
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,330
Now don't take photographs.

44
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:02,230
You must listen to My lecture attentively.

45
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:10,660
In a meditative way you must listen to Me.

46
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,900
You must make full use of Me, isn't it?

47
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,030
You should be meditative.

48
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,060
Then you can hear Me very clearly, you don't 
have to bother.

49
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:27,120
You have to be meditative.]

50
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,419
So you are facing towards the south as a witness.

51
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:44,530
Just now somebody told me that in the south 
people put their head towards the south and

52
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:49,240
put their feet towards the north, I mean, 
imagine.

53
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,419
The feet are put towards Shiva, who is in 
the north.

54
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,130
Kailasha is in the north, isn't it?

55
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,930
It is not in the south.

56
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,160
So why put your feet towards the north?

57
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,670
I mean, one must use logic.

58
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,770
These brahmins have told you all these stories 
and you are doing just the opposite that should

59
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,770
not be done.

60
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,910
Sometimes I feel God save this country from 
brahmins.

61
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:19,770
They're everywhere now: they're our rulers, 
they're everywhere, and they have no idea

62
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,919
what Brahma is.

63
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:34,770
If they are real Brahmins, I'm sure one day 
the real Brahmins will be in charge of this

64
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,820
country.

65
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:44,210
So now when we understand that Shiva is the 
first thing that is established in the matter,

66
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,720
then in us also first the Shiva is established.

67
00:06:49,720 --> 00:07:00,860
When the fetus takes his form, the throb in 
the heart is the establishment of Shiva.

68
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:08,530
That is the sign that Shiva has been established.

69
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:25,169
In case of people who are born with bad heart 
or with troubles, one has to say that Shiva

70
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:26,169
is not fully established.

71
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:33,300
Not that they are bad people, but they are 
not supposed to live for long, and have to

72
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,430
have another heart later on maybe.

73
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:46,259
Or that there might be some sort of a problem 
in their previous life, and if they pay attention

74
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,190
to Shiva tattwa, their heart can be cured.

75
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,330
So the most important organ in the body is 
the heart.

76
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,600
If the heart fails, you cannot remain in existence.

77
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:05,960
So the most important thing is to look after 
your Shiva principle which is the Atma.

78
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,760
We are worried about every sort of mundane 
thing.

79
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:21,180
Worried about this, worried about that, but 
we are not worried about our Spirit.

80
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,900
Which is the biggest problems with us.

81
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:32,950
If you worry about your Spirit, if you pay 
attention to your Spirit, the whole universe

82
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:39,830
then vibrates with Parabrahma which is nothing 
but joy.

83
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:51,890
So without, without any attention to Spirit, 
if we think we can enjoy life you cannot.

84
00:08:51,890 --> 00:09:02,450
You cannot enjoy your life if you pay attention 
to other nonsensical things and you do not

85
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:09,850
pay attention to your Spirit, the complete 
silence comes into us only through Spirit.

86
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:16,490
If the Spirit is awakened within us, this 
silence starts working and you feel extremely

87
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,649
relaxed and absolutely one with yourself.

88
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:30,140
There is no problem, you don't seek other 
things that normally people seek -- you seek

89
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,700
your own company and you want to be some time 
with yourself.

90
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:43,990
Only thing that you seek after finding your 
Spirit is the company of other sahaja yogis

91
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,270
who also have found the Spirit, so that there 
is a rapport established between Spirits,

92
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,060
that is in the heart.

93
00:09:51,060 --> 00:10:00,480
And this Spirit is the universal being within 
us about which I have told you that once you

94
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,480
become one with the Spirit, you automatically 
become universally conscious.

95
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,120
There are so many qualities of the Shiva, 
Shiva tattwa, of the principle of Shiva that

96
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,740
I need not tell you, but today I will tell 
you another dimension which I have not touched

97
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,870
so far about Shiva tattwa.

98
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:32,080
The physical aspect of Shiva tattwa is that 
such a person is a more a cold type of a person.

99
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:44,780
In the sense that such a person is not a person 
who gives hot vibrations, but who has too

100
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:54,990
much of heat sometimes, not in balance, overdoes 
it, develops a kind of a temperament which

101
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,750
can be extremely cold.

102
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:05,360
Could be low blood pressure with it, could 
be diarrhea also, diarrhea also one can get

103
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,560
with too much of spiritual strength.

104
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,900
And also could be on the love side because 
of the left side.

105
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:23,230
Because left side is the kapha as you call 
it, is kapha is the phlegm that is more.

106
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:31,100
Because the left side is more, such a person 
is always apt to catch colds and has problems

107
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,380
of the colds.

108
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:41,110
So such a person has to protect oneself from 
getting into colds and things like that and

109
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:46,610
the methods to be employed are to be learnt 
through Sahaja Yoga.

110
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:54,630
But to give it a balance the Spirit itself 
is beyond health problems.

111
00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:02,400
But the left sided person who always thinks 
of the Spirit also can become one-sided, when

112
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,450
he has to live on this earth he has to be 
a balanced person.

113
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:13,230
So he has to take to another side and that 
side is the activity of the spiritual growth

114
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,280
within himself.

115
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:22,650
A person who is very spiritually developed 
cannot exist as a Shiva tattwa on this earth.

116
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,100
He has to exist as a balanced personality.

117
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:33,350
And when he starts developing that balancing 
within himself, the Spirit from his heart

118
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,450
starts rising and goes on top of his head.

119
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:43,149
So this is the second stage where one has 
to reach.

120
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:49,730
Here is the whole collectivity (touches head) 
-- so when you start taking your love and

121
00:12:49,730 --> 00:13:01,120
affection into your central nervous system, 
you can say, and put it on top of your head,

122
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,960
that means as soon as you put it in your Virat, 
when it starts spreading through your Virata

123
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:13,350
shakti, through your collective being, then 
only you are a complete personality.

124
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:23,700
Otherwise you are Shiva tattwa -- Shiva tattwa 
exists whether this universe exists or not.

125
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:30,269
It exists even when the whole universe is 
existing; even, even it vanishes it all goes

126
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:35,329
into that magnet, into that Shiva tattwa.

127
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:46,120
So a person who has spiritual hankerings must 
know that to raise your Shiva above the heart

128
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:55,860
level, he has to raise it gradually onto a 
very detached method of existing on top of

129
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,639
the Sahasrara.

130
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:06,379
Where there is a complete balance, complete 
balance.

131
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:11,790
Many people I have seen in Sahaja Yoga are 
extremely loving, nice, very sweet persons.

132
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:17,490
Like in Delhi, I would say people are not 
so harsh as in Bombay.

133
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:23,290
Bombay people could be harsh, Puna people 
are little harsher also.

134
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,990
But Bombay and Puna people are deeper.

135
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:35,279
The reason is they have balanced themselves 
a little, and they have gone above their heart

136
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,970
feelings like sympathies.

137
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:43,700
"Don't be unkind to somebody, don't say anything 
harsh to somebody," can be very, very funny

138
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:52,529
also sometimes -- like yesterday I was sleeping 
in the place where you all were sleeping.

139
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:59,640
Now if I was in any Bombay or Puna center, 
anywhere, you can't hear any voice, anywhere,

140
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:07,300
nothing -- like a lion, you see, like a tiger 
is in a forest, nobody will hear your voice.

141
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:14,670
If there's a tiger, you can know for miles 
together there's tiger somewhere, it's so

142
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,670
silent.

143
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:21,230
But if I'm in Delhi, then everybody's talking: 
somebody was talking about money, this that,

144
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,680
the whole kind of jabbering was [on], even 
the sahaja yogis from foreign had become Delhi

145
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
sahaja yogis.

146
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,110
They were talking so much I was surprised, 
how did they take to this talking so much

147
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:37,230
there: always talking, jabber, jabber -- On 
the contrary if I'm sleeping there you all

148
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,889
should have been in meditation, sitting down 
and doing meditation.

149
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:46,079
Instead of that everyone was busy with all 
the possible nonsensical talks, as if they

150
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,740
have no other chance to talk.

151
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:55,170
And they were all jabbering, jab jab jab, 
I didn't know what to say and I just I didn't

152
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,410
know what to do.

153
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,300
(Inaudible) 
But this is what one has to know, that unless

154
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:08,540
and until you raise your sympathetic attitudes 
-- like you tell somebody something, "I have

155
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,580
had such a problem in this business", say 
example like this.

156
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:18,630
I mean, what a topic, but doesn't matter.If 
you start, "I had a problem with this", another

157
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,870
will: "Yes I too had..." you see, the sympathies.

158
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:27,459
"I too had such a problem, these people are 
so bad, that happened, he had the same problem",

159
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:28,480
same talk.

160
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,630
They are all, you see, talking about things 
which are irrelevant to Sahaja Yoga.

161
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,230
Even relevant to Sahaja Yoga you should not 
talk when I'm there.

162
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,230
I have to make a humble request to all of 
you -- that the way you people sometimes behave

163
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:51,730
is not good and is not congenial to sahaja 
yogis.

164
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,190
Even to keep your mouth open in My front is 
not a good thing.

165
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:01,670
But I don't want to tell you in such details 
but it is so many things are there that you

166
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:06,870
have to learn before you raise your Shiva 
tattwa from your heart.

167
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:13,149
You are good at pleasing people, at organizing 
you are excellent, you organize very well,

168
00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:21,669
there are no quarrels; sahaja yogis in Bombay 
quarrel quite a lot and even Puna sahaja yogis

169
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:22,669
are quarrelsome.

170
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:27,199
But I must say Puna sahaja yogis are very 
deep, and Bombay sahaja yogis are very deep

171
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,199
individually, they have achieved something.

172
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,130
Now they have to go further than that, is 
to go little bit in the heart again.

173
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:39,149
You see, the second essence (?)they have to 
have to feel more that way, because that way

174
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:43,539
they are very, very strict with people.

175
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:46,259
But you see, certain amount of strictness 
is to be accepted.

176
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:52,960
For example, if somebody is told: "Don't touch 
Mother's feet": one feels very bad.

177
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,669
But this is a very mundane sort of an understanding 
of the Mother.

178
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:03,960
If She says: "Don't touch My feet" that's 
what you are supposed to do, you have to do

179
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,659
exactly what pleases Me, and not what will 
please you.

180
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:14,149
So you must change your attention from pleasing 
all the public -- some people say "Those who

181
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:17,119
come first time Mother, we must not say this".

182
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,340
You must!

183
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:27,799
Certain things you must say to them, otherwise 
you will make Me a-prasanna: that will cause

184
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:28,879
problems!

185
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:36,129
But when you say to others, you need not go 
like Puna and Bombay people in their special

186
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:42,729
Marathi language, but say it in a proper Urdu 
style, that people don't feel bad, but you

187
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:44,159
must say it!

188
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:48,809
You should not put those people on My head; 
instead of that you should tell them in such

189
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:51,850
a way that people are alright.

190
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:59,549
So to go deeper into you, you must do also 
individual meditation and samori.

191
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:06,269
I would not say all the sahaj yogis in Delhi 
are like that, but... we are very good at

192
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:12,299
organizing, which our Bombay sahaja yogis 
and these Puna sahaja yogis must learn.

193
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:15,630
They quarrel among themselves and I really 
get fed up.

194
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:20,279
And they treat each other shabbily, that I 
don't like.

195
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,429
But individually they are alright, so they 
become individualistic.

196
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:30,080
Some people become individualistic and some 
people become publicist, public... they'll

197
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,370
please the public, now they are two extremes.

198
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,409
What should a sahaja yogi do?

199
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:41,970
They have to become Mother addicts.

200
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,159
They should do what your Mother likes.

201
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:48,809
Do you understand?

202
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:55,910
Need not please the public or need not please 
the individual, but do what your Mother will

203
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,330
like, that's a very simple thing which Adi 
Shankaracharya told you, that just keep the

204
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,340
Mother pleased.

205
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,899
But nobody makes that study.

206
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:08,470
Try to make the study: "What makes Mother 
pleased".

207
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:14,509
Then you will see, I'm very easily pleased, 
you see?

208
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:17,919
As a Shiva tattwa.

209
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,019
Even if you make mistakes try to pull your 
ears alright (laughter).

210
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:28,409
But don't go too far with it.

211
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:37,169
You see, the mistakes to commit is alright, 
but don't take it for granted that you can

212
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,509
go on committing mistakes.

213
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:43,639
Because you really get a big rope, but you 
will hang yourself ultimately, isn't it?

214
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:49,710
So be afraid of the rope also which is given 
to you, it will hang you much better otherwise.

215
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,460
So one has to understand that you should not 
be addicted to public opinion or to the opinion

216
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,460
of your own.

217
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,460
Both things are wrong.

218
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,110
You must behave in such a manner that it should 
please all the deities within Me, as far as

219
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,909
I am concerned I don't exist.

220
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:13,499
I have no existence, really believe Me, I 
have no existence at all, I just, is an assemblage

221
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:18,809
of so many existences.

222
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:25,700
Otherwise I don't exist, I don't find Myself 
anywhere in this body, anywhere I don't find

223
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,649
Myself, anywhere in the universe!

224
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:30,429
I'm nowhere, I sometimes find, 'What is all 
this?

225
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:33,279
Is not Mine, is all foreign to Me".

226
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:47,360
But still I permeate into it, enjoy it, live 
with it, but I'm not in it, nowhere.

227
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,489
If you just try to understand what pleases 
your Mother, you will develop your dignity

228
00:21:52,489 --> 00:22:04,559
because I want you to be dignified; it will 
develop your joy because I want you to be

229
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:12,419
joyous; it will give you more capacity to 
achieve more vibrations within yourself because

230
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:20,769
that is what I'm giving -- whatever is good 
for you if you do that, it will please Me.

231
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:27,049
But what I think is good for you, you may 
not think, you may have your own ideas, individualistic

232
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:28,049
again.

233
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:35,359
Or maybe public-wise -- like I've told you 
that please don't arrange My program before

234
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,259
7 o'clock in the evening.

235
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:43,080
Then you may say, 'It won't suit our public'.

236
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,389
Doesn't matter: it doesn't suit Me, that's 
the main point.

237
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:50,779
Because I have certain timings when only I 
can really be very good.

238
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:54,149
That time I have to give to somebody else, 
is fixed!

239
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:59,159
So you don't fix My timings according to yours.

240
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,359
Morning time before 11 o'clock no programs 
should be fixed.

241
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:07,032
Early in the morning if you fix, fix at five, 
I don't mind.

242
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:11,669
I have certain timings which I have to use 
for some other purpose!

243
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:18,509
So you have to understand that whatever suits 
Me should be done, because that is for your

244
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:19,509
good also.

245
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:23,679
Because there are most beneficial.

246
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:30,019
I'm just telling you My own tricks so that 
you take more advantage of Me.

247
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:34,669
But they insist on that the people who are 
going to the office won't be able to come-

248
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:37,090
that's people should not come at all!

249
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:43,159
If there is a picture at 7 o'clock they'll 
go at that picture or not?

250
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:52,649
Then why should you make your Mother so cheap 
that it should suit their convenience -- if

251
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:59,049
there are few people it is even better for 
us: we'll have better accommodation in the

252
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:00,879
Kingdom of God.

253
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:03,929
So don't make Me cheap!

254
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:06,059
That one should understand, not to cheapen 
Me, keeping the dignity of your Mother.

255
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:11,690
Whatever is to be achieved, I agree, that 
all the brothers and sisters must be helped,

256
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:20,549
all the public must be helped, but we can't 
get rid of the kachras otherwise if you see:

257
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:23,749
there are lots of things which are to be just 
thrown away.

258
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:27,169
So we don't, should not worry about the kachra 
part.

259
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:33,519
Whatever is the best we'll have, but to have 
that also one should not speak harshly.

260
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,109
Again I will say not to use harsh words.

261
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:41,120
The way people: "Get out, get out, get out" 
like that one should not talk.

262
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,409
Change your language.

263
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:51,210
You must educate yourself how to talk to people 
in a soft way, in a proper way.

264
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,999
That is very important for Sahaja Yoga, because 
if you go on insulting, maybe you might insult

265
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:55,999
some saint!

266
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:59,080
So you should not do in that way.

267
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:09,180
Understand it, and try to make your individual 
being so capable that, when you go to the

268
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:19,059
public, you are able to put the right concept, 
the right concept, the right conduct, the

269
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:24,749
right behavior, and the right knowledge.

270
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:29,899
Here I do not mean right rationally, right 
which is absolute.

271
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:34,236
The Shiva is the absolute, He is the giver 
of absolute knowledge, He knows what pleases

272
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:35,236
Me.

273
00:25:35,236 --> 00:25:50,110
The moment something will happen that will 
really displease Me, He will shut the show.

274
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,600
He is just watching this to please Me.

275
00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:01,789
The moment he'll find that this is not working 
out, He'll stop the whole show and will say:

276
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:04,379
"Shut it, finished".

277
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:11,950
So though I may say the spectator is Shiva, 
but He is just the judge, and He sees those

278
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,950
things.

279
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:18,009
So try to be all right, a nice spectacle I 
try to make, to please Shiva so He continues

280
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:24,639
to be there, and this let [let this?] universe 
be a nice place to stay in, in which you rise

281
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:32,999
and attain that eternal life which is promised 
to you.

282
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:35,210
But one has to understand what pleases Mother.

283
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:43,669
Some people have a habit of just looking at 
Me straight all the time: not the way to be

284
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:44,669
done!

285
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:51,969
Put your eyes down, all the time just you 
cannot stare at Me, it's stupid!

286
00:26:51,969 --> 00:26:59,039
Apart from stupidity it will not please Me, 
will it please you if I start staring at you

287
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,009
all the time?

288
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:05,309
I don't stare at you, I try to please you 
by doing all kinds of things: why don't you

289
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:07,460
learn something from Me, how I try to please 
you?

290
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:14,080
You can't do all these things of course, I 
know, because somebody says: "Mother, we went

291
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,499
there, the horse was given to us, this, that," 
this help you cannot achieve yourself.

292
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:23,679
For Me, if I have a difficulty, you can't 
solve My difficulty.

293
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,960
Isn't it?

294
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,759
But I can solve your difficulties.

295
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:32,629
So I can please you very easily because I 
have so many methods of pleasing you.

296
00:27:32,629 --> 00:27:35,349
For whatever methods are there, by which one 
should not positively displease, that's the

297
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:37,149
only thing is.

298
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:42,409
You don't do anything special, but don't do 
something extraordinary just to displease.

299
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:52,619
If you understand this simple thing, that 
don't try to do anything that will displease

300
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:53,619
to please Me.

301
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:54,619
It is so simple.

302
00:27:54,619 --> 00:28:01,559
Don't have to do anything extra, just try 
to be loving, affectionate, dignified, and

303
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:05,539
I'll be very happy with all that.

304
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:07,789
As it is I'm overjoyed, I'm very happy with 
you.

305
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:15,210
But I have to tell you what one has to achieve, 
and how one has to go above these things.

306
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:24,649
So it is necessary now for Delhi people to 
rise from the heart to the Sahasrara.

307
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:36,369
And it is necessary for Bombay and Puna people 
to go from heart... to go from the Sahasrara

308
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:38,929
to the heart.

309
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:42,179
I would say Rahuri people are in between.

310
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,929
Rahuri people are in between.

311
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:47,850
They are very good organizers, and they don't 
create problems for Me as far as individuals

312
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,850
are concerned.

313
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:58,089
So I think Rahuri is a place, perhaps maybe 
it is my Mecca, that it is so good whatever

314
00:28:58,089 --> 00:28:59,089
it is.

315
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:00,720
But we all can be like that.

316
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:12,460
We all can change and inform each other and 
improve and educate ourselves.

317
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:18,999
All this education can come to us, if we really 
love ourselves, and care for our evolution.

318
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:23,739
We don't have to bother about it much, if 
we really care for.

319
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:27,679
Gradually all these things will work out and 
the balance can be established.

320
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:35,320
Those people who talk too much should not 
talk so much.

321
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,599
What I feel that when you talk too much when 
you'll stop you just stop.

322
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:50,200
In between: when it is necessary you must 
talk, when it is not necessary you should

323
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,479
not talk.

324
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:55,239
So that kind of personality gradually you 
can develop with Sahaja Yoga, that you will

325
00:29:55,239 --> 00:30:00,279
develop that wisdom how far to go, how far 
not to go.

326
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:03,179
Not to go is the quality of Shiva.

327
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:09,179
He doesn't do anything, He is just sitting 
down there and watching the whole joke.

328
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:20,619
He doesn't do anything, but He's the one who 
has to watch: if He doesn't watch, then the

329
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,619
whole show is over.

330
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:28,309
If you understand that in not doing anything, 
how much He's doing.

331
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:33,299
See the contrast: He's doing nothing as such.

332
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,580
But He's making everybody dance, to please 
Him.

333
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:44,450
In the same way in one shot you have both 
the natures, as sahaja yogis you can achieve

334
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:55,830
that kind of a balanced personality.

335
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,989
It is for your good, for your evolution, for 
your development.

336
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:03,989
So today all of you have a great chance of 
evolving individually within yourself with

337
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:13,630
Shiva tattwa, which ultimately permeates into 
the whole.

338
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:18,440
Kabira has said it in a beautiful couplet, 
I don't know if you people have understood:

339
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:28,159
(Hindi) The compassion of my heart I will 
vibrate, I will bring it out; the compassion

340
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:38,309
of my heart I will vibrate, I'll bring it 
out; (Hindi) and put it into the five elements.

341
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:42,309
See Kabira, do you follow him how great he 
is?

342
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:47,350
People talk of Kabirdas, see, he says that 
take it out of the heart and put it into all

343
00:31:47,350 --> 00:32:06,359
the five elements.

344
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:19,979
This

345
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:26,559
is what is Sahaja Yoga.

346
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:39,119
If you understand that, then you don't have 
to understand anything else.

347
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:46,200
You have got it in your heart, become the 
capitalist in your heart, and become a communist

348
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
outside.

349
00:32:47,200 --> 00:33:07,649
If you can achieve this balance properly, 
you have done it, and we can do it, we all

350
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:42,440
of us put together we will do it, we can achieve 
it and we can show to

351
00:33:42,440 --> 00:34:10,460
the world that everyone can achieve it.

352
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:24,200
All ordinary human beings so-called will can 
become extraordinary.

353
00:34:24,200 --> 00:35:06,940
So today we have to decide about ourselves 
that we are going to do it, we are going to

354
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:52,430
be educated about it, in a spiritual way, 
in a Sahaja way.

355
00:35:52,430 --> 00:36:47,340
And every moment if you watch yourself you 
can know.

356
00:36:47,340 --> 00:37:02,619
And

357
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:34,730
not to explain yourself, and to say "Oh, this 
happened to me, that happened to me": that's

358
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:37,420
not the point.

359
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:41,250
Many people tell Me like that, that's absurd.

360
00:37:41,250 --> 00:38:33,140
You challenge yourself: how can it happen 
to you?

361
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:38,380
Why don't you do it?

362
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,240
You should do it.

363
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,869
Why can't you do it?

364
00:38:42,869 --> 00:39:20,470
Like that you take yourself to task and 
you can work it out, I'm sure, because you've

365
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:30,329
got 
the power to do it.

366
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:51,559
I bless you all for your spiritual development 
and for your collectivity.

367
00:39:51,559 --> 00:40:10,799
Both things must be looked after.

368
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:36,099
If you have spiritual development and no collectivity, 
it is useless.

369
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:56,720
If you

370
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:03,460
have collectivity and spiritual development 
none, it is useless.

371
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,789
Combine it properly.

372
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:34,559
So we have to take Shiva

373
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:41,470
and establish Him into the Virat.

374
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:54,109
This is

375
00:41:54,109 --> 00:42:17,170
what we have to do, and if you understand 
this point, your relationships with others

376
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:50,019
also will 
be good, permanent, of

377
00:42:50,019 --> 00:43:12,170
a

378
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:21,940
very substantial nature.

379
00:43:21,940 --> 00:45:06,299
And the quality of sahaja yogis' life will 
be something very, very great.

380
00:45:06,299 --> 02:22:00,970
May God bless you all.
