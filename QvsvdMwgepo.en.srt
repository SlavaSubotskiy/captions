1
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:28,550
We had a very good session, I should say,
and a very successful trip in Portugal and

2
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:06,020
even better in Spain.
Portugal is a place where gurus have touched

3
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:18,140
very nicely because people are too simple,
and because they are too simple they are affected

4
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
too hard. And I was really confronted with
so many sick people there who have been to

5
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:37,230
gurus, who have been only for two, three years
with them are badly affected and surprisingly

6
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,930
how the whole thing is exposed, that we may
be able to do much better in Portugal.

7
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,620
Now, the Portuguese people get lot of wine.
They drink a lot; they really drink. I mean,

8
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,650
they have all kinds of wines in their country.
It's a very big problem of that place, is

9
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:32,650
it that has many wines and I think the drunkenness
make them extremely lethargic and that lethargy

10
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:44,430
brought down that empire. We can see it's
a very huge place. I mean the buildings, if

11
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,870
you see, are very beautifully done, lots of
buildings with lots of architecture, and all

12
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:02,740
that is like a desolate place. The reason
is: the people who were at the time quite

13
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:14,970
affluent were doing well. Gradually unemployment
started settling down, lots of strikes - just

14
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:24,099
the same thing as I feel is happening in this
country - and unemployment and amounting to

15
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,990
starvation. First they used to get doles and
all that, as we get here; gradually it stopped.

16
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,240
Now it's so bad that all of them have to depend
on their parents. There's no way. They have

17
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,240
no source of income, very few industries.
It's one of the poorest country in the whole

18
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,520
of Europe.
That made Me think about England, that we

19
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:03,370
have to know that this country also may face
a phase, if we do not get up now. You see

20
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:14,759
it's all right to divert your attention to
Falklands and all that, but it cannot feed

21
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:21,759
you. So, we have to understand, all the Sahaj
Yogis must understand, that they all must

22
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:28,789
have some sort of a degree or something on
the paper; that's a very important. And though

23
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:38,529
you are all realized souls and you are spiritually
so endowed, everything is there, but you have

24
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:45,559
to think of the whole. If the country completely
goes down in its production and its capacity

25
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:53,539
to activate itself, you will go down, too.
So, your attention should be now, of course,

26
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:01,479
you should not be materialistic, but towards
putting more activity into you, even in Sahaja

27
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:04,189
Yoga, in meditating, in working it out in
yourself.

28
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:11,189
So, lethargy is not going to pay. And this
is one thing, is such an inertia, such an

29
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,240
inertia that exists, that unless and until
you really put in complete willpower, this

30
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:26,830
inertia may not be combated, may be very difficult,
even in Sahaja Yoga. You see, it is very easy

31
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:35,490
to escape and explain, you see, yourself,
"Oh, I got up and, you know, this happened,

32
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:42,490
that happened." But, I think the symptoms
are of a very dangerous type and as Sahaja

33
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:50,770
Yogis you have to be very patriotic about
it and you have to think about it. After all,

34
00:06:53,449 --> 00:07:00,449
you are symbols of the English people. Whatever
works out in you will start working out in

35
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:10,819
the rest. So, how you behave towards yourself
and towards the general atmosphere is very,

36
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:20,449
very important.
Now, towards Sahaja Yoga also the attitude

37
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:27,610
has to be understood very clearly. You see,
like a Maharaja in India who lives in quite

38
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,729
great comfort first of all, lives like a lord
and he orders about, you see, and then everything

39
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:44,129
is lost. But, still he talks like a lord,
behaves like a lord. His whole thing is the

40
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:50,869
same way, though, it's not that the kingdom
is there, that he's the ruler, but he'll talk

41
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:56,149
like that to everyone, because the habits
are formed. I think the mind also has formed

42
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:03,149
a habit. The whole atmosphere is charged with
such ego since long and that's why towards

43
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:10,789
Sahaja Yoga also, the attitude has to be humbler,
much humbler, because without humility you

44
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,029
cannot do. That's one thing you must understand.
It's no question of you rationally saying

45
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:22,839
something about it or explaining about it.
But, you see, basically one has to be extremely

46
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,999
humble.
First of all, it's a very big privilege to

47
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:32,999
get realization. You know that. It's a greater
privilege to do it, and it's the greatest

48
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:39,890
to be a Sahaja Yogi. Is a very great privilege
that you have, which very few people have

49
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:46,450
and you are the ones who are chosen specially.
But, the humility part of it is still missing

50
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:53,450
about Sahaja Yoga, about Sahaja Yoga. Like,
we should ask, "Make me a better Sahaja Yogi,

51
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:06,370
a humbler Sahaja Yogi, a compassionate Sahaja
Yogi, a sweeter Sahaja Yogi. Dissolve my ego."

52
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,100
This is very important, we must understand,
because whatever works out in you, will work

53
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:24,100
out in this country.
Arrogance is something that with ego you can

54
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,209
never understand you have been arrogant. The
way you talk to others, the way you behave

55
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:37,209
towards others, you will never understand,
because there is ego. If you are standing

56
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,750
in the darkness, the light is there but it
is covered with something. How will you understand

57
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:50,750
where is the light? So, humility must be there,
because you people have very developed brains,

58
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,769
very developed, over-developed brains and
that brain can, you see, always tell you,

59
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:05,769
"Oh, you are better than others," you see,
always. "The another one is no good and the

60
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:11,490
third one is useless. You see, you are the
best." That's typical of the brain teaches,

61
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:17,130
you see. And when it starts working out, it's
very difficult, you see, to see that the one

62
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:24,130
who is saying this is nowhere, because from
the point where you see, you cannot see what

63
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:31,519
you are saying. What you see is the whole
thing as if you have to command it; you have

64
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:42,310
to ask for it.
Of course, the quality is very much changing

65
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,190
now, everybody is becoming very, very, very
sweet and sober and nobody now demands anything

66
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,519
from Me like, "You must give me this, Mother.
You have to do it. You have to look after

67
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,060
me. After all, I have been to Your Caxton
Hall once, You see, and how dare You do not

68
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:04,060
look after my mother when she met an accident?"
Something like that. That's over now. That's

69
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:13,160
over.
The quality is improving now and one has started

70
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:19,800
learning now how to laugh at your own ego
and this and that. But I personally think

71
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:26,800
that one has to realize that if you represent
this country to your Mother, then it has to

72
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:34,120
improve still. "Still I have to improve. I
have to go ahead. I have to go further with

73
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:41,120
it and have I to develop that beauty of humility."
Like in Portugal they told Me Lord Byron,

74
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:55,350
whom I think to be a useless fellow, absolutely
good for nothing and I regretted every minute

75
00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:02,350
why he was created on this earth, he went
and said that ... he went and said, "Cintra

76
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:10,279
is a very beautiful place. Cintra is too good
to be wasted on Portuguese." It should have

77
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,480
been from Mr. Lord Byron, whosoever he may
be. You see, typical! And it pinches everyone,

78
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:24,879
you know. Everybody feels. But think if you
are the person about whom he said.

79
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:36,819
So, one has to develop a kind of a humility
that "I have to still receive; I have to still

80
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:47,269
get it; it has to work out." Now, when it
comes to that kind of an attitude, then you

81
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:54,889
turn round. Turn round upon yourself. What
have you done for Sahaja Yoga? One question,

82
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,720
simple question: what have you done for Sahaja
Yoga? How many people have you given realization?

83
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:26,310
How many people have you been able to cure?
How much peace have you got within yourself?

84
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:36,360
How much blissful are you? How much compassion
have you got? How much forgiveness and patience

85
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:44,629
you have for others? How much of sharing you
can do? These are the signs of sahaja yogis,

86
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,720
that you break your shell. You become collective.
How much do you understand others? And how

87
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:08,569
much do you understand giving [to] others?
What have you given to others, even on material

88
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:15,569
level? Let's see. These questions should be
put to yourself. On a very material level

89
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:26,660
these questions are to be asked, on a very
material level, because the light comes down

90
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:33,660
to material level. How many people you can
forgive?

91
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,269
You are realized souls. You are prophets,
no doubt. You can make others prophets, but

92
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:50,269
you have to be the quality, also. The quality
of a prophet is his nobility. He is so noble.

93
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:07,740
Nobleness. In comparison with other people,
who are not realized souls, he is nobler;

94
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:16,629
he is more dignified; he is much more forgiving.
So the whole way of dealing with others will

95
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:30,509
change. He is obedient. We have to obey in
Sahaja Yoga. We have to obey our good will.

96
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:47,810
Otherwise, you are difficult people. It's
impossible. Nobody can do anything to you.

97
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:55,449
If you are like a thorn, how can anybody help
you?

98
00:15:55,449 --> 00:16:02,430
So the quality of a sahaja yogi is measured
by another kind of a measure. Is not the way

99
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:09,430
human beings measure the quality of other
human beings. Like, somebody has a good taste,

100
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:15,649
for example, so-called. Then people say, "Oh,
he's great, with a good taste." Or if he has

101
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:21,800
a big car, "Oh, he's a big man." Or he talks
like that, or he walks like that, or says

102
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,809
this, that and all those things. Or a question
like this, "Why did you say like that?" All

103
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:33,120
these words, you know. They sound very hard
to Me. "Why do you do like that?" This kind

104
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,059
of a language itself was not there in this
English language.

105
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:44,059
Nowadays the language is so changed and very
rude, very arrogant and very harmful. So,

106
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:53,720
first ask yourself, because Sahaja Yoga will
spread - of course, slowly and steadily, I

107
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:05,139
hope - only through your images. You are the
reflectors. You put My thousands of posters.

108
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:15,280
I am so unique, you know. They'll say, "All
right, this unique personality is taken out,

109
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:22,630
no good. What about the disciples?" So, actually
whatever is in the lower level animals is

110
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:38,100
important, like in lower level animals the
king is the one. Say, the tiger has to kill

111
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:45,570
an animal, big animal. It is he who only can
kill. Till human stage also perhaps it is

112
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:52,120
so. The one who can really dominate others,
survival of the fittest, is the rule.

113
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:59,120
Is the other way round, now. It's changed,
completely. How much free you are in your

114
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:10,440
ideas, while you are still identified with
old ideas. But free doesn't mean abandonment,

115
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:17,440
by any chance. Freedom means you respect the
freedom of others. First and foremost thing

116
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:24,700
of freedom is that you must respect the freedom
of others. Even God respects your freedom.

117
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:30,190
He cannot give you realization if you don't
want it. He cannot force it. So, respect the

118
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:36,040
freedom of others. But, that does not mean
by respecting the freedom of others there

119
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:43,040
should be abandonment. If somebody is abandoned
in Sahaja Yoga, he goes out of the circulation

120
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:50,740
of Sahaja Yoga. It's not coming in is so important,
I've told you hundred times. It's the throwing

121
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:59,040
out part of it, you see. Sometimes I feel
I should use some glues to stick on. Maybe,

122
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:06,040
the wheel can turn very fast and some of half-baked
may be thrown out back again into the oven.

123
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:14,960
So, I feel, in these countries where I went,
Spain, they call it. Spain, still half-developing;

124
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:22,770
Portugal, developing. I don't know what you
think about Italy, whatever it is called.

125
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:31,340
Very humble people, very humble from the very
first day. Anyone who comes from the very

126
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,430
first day, they are very humble and because
they are humble, they are sensitive to Me;

127
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:46,430
because you have to be really very humble
to be sensitive to Me, that's a fact, because

128
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:55,250
I'm too simple, naïve, as if I do not understand
anything. I look like that, I mean, as if

129
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:08,780
I have no knowledge of anything - very simple
woman, talks in a very simple way, is very

130
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:15,780
friendly, all right. So to understand Me you
have to be extremely humble and if you cannot

131
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:30,050
go to that level of humility you cannot see
Me and you cannot understand Me. And the more

132
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,950
you start understanding, the more humble you
become, naturally, because you know what it

133
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:44,490
is.
So, I have told you many a times about humility

134
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:50,420
part of it, but My experience of these countries
was where I went there. I mean, they are very

135
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:57,420
humble people, very humble about Sahaja Yoga,
extremely humble they were. Even the new people

136
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:07,660
were very humble. Spanish people same thing,
extremely humble. You see, Dawn had told Me

137
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:14,250
that they have a ego of a bull fighter, but
the one who came this time were so humble

138
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:21,070
I was amazed. Even if I could touch them,
that was sufficient for them. Nobody pulled

139
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:28,070
My hand, nothing.
So, this is what it is: one has to understand

140
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:40,930
that we have certain tags of our past which
has to go down. The language should be extremely

141
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:53,660
humble language. Try to read ... I don't know
whose language is so humble. Maybe Mine, I

142
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:06,250
don't know. But, try to read books where people
speak humble language, humble way of talking.

143
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:15,440
You'll enjoy it, really enjoy it. Humility
is the glory of sahaja yogis, is the only

144
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:24,860
way they will grow. It's like putting your
roots down and down and down.

145
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:41,060
The people who went from here were themselves
amazed at the humility of the people who were

146
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,920
there, very much amazed, the way things are
working out there, the way they helped us

147
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:56,920
and did everything for us. And I am sure now
in Spain we'll have a very nice, very, very

148
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:05,260
nice center. Of course, the Ambassador is
a very, very humble man - you know him, too

149
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,500
humble - and he might be coming here, and
one day I want to call him here to the ashram

150
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,980
also. He and his wife will be here. So, the
Ambassador was very sweet and he called Me

151
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,860
to his house, invited, and he had a nice tea
party.

152
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,170
He called Indians and everything and Indians
said, you know they asked Me for one thing.

153
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:31,010
You'll be shocked. They said, "What about
something to depend upon?" you see. "Can we

154
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:36,350
have Your photographs, something? It must
be having some vibrations. Should we use Your

155
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:43,350
photographs for our worship?" Can you imagine?
And, at first I said that "It's all right.

156
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,930
It will work out," because I didn't want to
say, "You have to take My photograph." So

157
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,500
she was so disappointed, the lady. She said,
"No, there must be a photograph or something

158
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:57,310
which we can use. After all, how can that
be?" Just imagine! And here, first thing comes

159
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:04,310
up, like a big snake, "Why Mother's photograph?
She should give us realization, She should

160
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:12,020
solve all our problems, all our sickness,
everything, but why Her photograph? This is

161
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:19,020
too much!" In this you can see the ego of
the people.

162
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,880
Now, regarding ashram, I had asked Nick, I
had asked him to make certain rules and regulations.

163
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:55,430
And I must say that, of course, Nick should
say things, as you, somebody told Me that

164
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:03,460
he should have been a little softer with it
and all that. But, supposing somebody is not

165
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:10,320
soft at all, so you must know that this is
said by Mother and you must do it. You see,

166
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,390
actually, when you say no to him, you are
saying no to Me also, isn't it? Because I

167
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:19,830
sent him. I told him and I told him that "You
must carry out these things." If you do not

168
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:26,480
allow him to carry out, he has to be perhaps
strict. By softer means, supposing something

169
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,480
fails, then what to do? I really don't know.
After realization even if do not do things,

170
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:45,070
what should we do? Can you suggest? I mean,
you should respect everyone. But say, even

171
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:52,730
if you respect, people get up at eight o'clock
in the morning; then what should you do? What

172
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,600
should be done, you just tell us? John, tell
Me. I mean, it is really surprising. You are

173
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:11,000
now prophets. Do you understand your quality,
what are you, what have I given you? Then

174
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,880
what should we do about it? You see, these
are so simple things, like children also.

175
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,230
If you are in a hostel, you are made to get
up in the morning, take your bath, get ready,

176
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:27,230
walk out. I mean, if you do not listen, anyone,
I mean, it's simple. Then, what should one

177
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:36,450
do with prophets? You just tell Me.
This is not the problem in Australia even.

178
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:48,930
But English one going to Australia, create
problems. I have seen. Sally, what a problem.

179
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:55,930
Ba pre. You could see in contrast, her ego.
Absolutely, in contrast I could see it clearly,

180
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:03,050
very egoistical. Though she said that she
was in - what place she was in? Jersey, and

181
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:11,100
there bhoots got her. But all the bhoots were
egoistical. That's the point. Such a contrast,

182
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:21,510
you know. If we have to grow as one body and
you are enlightened, part and parcel, part

183
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:29,510
and particle of the same body, supposing this
finger says, "No, no, I will not do it." Now,

184
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:36,510
somebody is, say, putting a big attack or
something and this hand says, "No, I will

185
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:46,210
not work out," then what to do? Actually,
it's a very big dilemma for Me because a hand

186
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:54,630
which is forced to do it will never do it
properly. If you don't force it, then what

187
00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:01,630
happens to that hand? I mean, just see, the
diligence is very important. We should not

188
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:12,830
take things for granted. You see, we take
ourselves for granted, everything for granted.

189
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:23,420
Is not proper. We have to work hard. We have
to work it out ourselves. You see, even if

190
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,950
you have ten thousand sahaja yogis, here,
what is going to happen? The quality is so

191
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,860
poor, isn't it?
You have to get up in the morning, do it,

192
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,600
meditation. You have to grow. You have to
grow still much more. And you know you are

193
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:45,600
so very few, I have to use you only. Of course,
nobody can force you. And even if you force,

194
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:54,040
a forced labor is not going to help in Sahaja
Yoga, that is. You take it from Me. It cannot.

195
00:28:54,040 --> 00:29:00,420
So, these people who go nowhere, where do
they stand? Now, anyone you tell the job.

196
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:05,600
Say, Warren also, in Australia. There were
jealousies about that, terrible jealousies.

197
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,510
"Why should he tell me?" Because there is
nobody to tell you within yourself. That's

198
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:17,490
the problem is it. So, that which is sleeping,
I put it into one man. All right, this man

199
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:24,490
is going to tell, but, then that person tells
you, then people feel jealous. I mean, these

200
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:31,550
are not the signs of a prophet. A prophet
is never jealous, because he knows he has

201
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:38,320
achieved his powers now. He's in his own power
and his power is of surrendering. He's not

202
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,490
of overpowering.
See, you cannot see the other side of it.

203
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:45,570
You think power means you sit on somebody's
head, then, "I am very powerful." Like a woman,

204
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,950
if she can make her husband dance to her tune,
then she thinks, "Oh, I am the most powerful

205
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:56,950
woman ever living." It's the other way round,
that the woman is so loving that husband can't

206
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:04,950
do without her, that sort of a power. She's
so sweet that the husband cannot manage without

207
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:12,140
her. That sort of a power is, should be the
power of a prophet 
and these things are very much deeply put

208
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:24,910
into us. So face it up and take it out. The
whole value system is upside down. I tell

209
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:34,080
you the whole value system is upside down.
See My life, own life. As a wife of such and

210
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:46,030
such and such I am expected to go into diamond
shops, buy diamonds, wear, become a big lady

211
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:54,190
with heels like that and walk with a neck
like that and do all sorts. I mean, this is

212
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,370
the normal thing. It's expected. And shout
at the chauffeur, and shout at the servants

213
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:04,920
and shout at everyone and behave in that manner.
I mean, that's what it is, the power is. You

214
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,430
see, that's how the woman express their husbands'
positions.

215
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:14,430
But, the other way round, is the situation
of a prophet. The prophet asserts his powers

216
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:27,870
through love. "How much can you hate me? I
love you double. Always, whatever you will

217
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:35,240
hate me, I'll love you double of that." Then
what will happen? But to love, one has to

218
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:46,660
sacrifice, one has to give, one has to bear.
Love doesn't hang in the air. That's one thing

219
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,790
people don't understand. Love is not only
talking love or if you are a little gentle

220
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:59,790
to somebody is not the point. But even that
bearing is a joy, because ultimately you are

221
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:08,800
doing it for love. If love is the joy-giving
thing, then that bearing is not much. You

222
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:16,520
are doing it for love's sake. See, because
love, unless and until it is shared you cannot

223
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:23,520
enjoy. So, first we have to be strict with
ourselves, I think would be a good idea, and

224
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:33,210
loving to others. That may be the way we might
work it out.

225
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:40,210
By God's grace we have a very nice place as
an ashram. We might get even better place.

226
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:47,820
You are the God's own blessed people. No one
can believe that we could have such a nice

227
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:56,060
place. But, what are we willing to do for
it? That's the point, we should say. Don't

228
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:04,730
take things for granted. I must warn you.
I know England is the heart, but in God's

229
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:14,580
realms one can create many hearts, not so
difficult. So more harmony should be brought

230
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:25,240
in. Even, you'll be surprised, in France,
it's so harmonious and so beautiful. Find

231
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:32,480
faults with yourself all the time.
Now, under certain circumstances I have to

232
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,880
appoint somebody, like I would say very personally,
I would say, Nick. Because Nick is doing no

233
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:46,280
job nowadays, he is quite a systematic person,
is all right, this thing. He has some problems,

234
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,950
I know. You, too, have problems, all right?
But he's the one available today and he's

235
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:58,950
the one who is going to do it. Take one case.
Now you must understand why Mother has appointed

236
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:12,240
somebody, all right? Accept it. Because...
(speaking about the children) It's a big dance,

237
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:25,679
all that... They're trying to entertain...
see, look at this dancing. They are feeling

238
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:39,120
the tenseness of the situation and trying
to entertain... That's it; that is love. See,

239
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:57,440
they want to relax you, they want to relax
you, they want you to feel nice, to be joyous.

240
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:07,170
Look at them, in the same way, we should be.
I am sure. I am sure now, henceforth. I think

241
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:25,110
best thing is to make some poems. That may
be a solution, all right? Let's see. And let

242
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:33,870
everybody start writing poems. Would be a
good idea. And then that should work out.

243
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:41,620
And sing the song of praises. It's very little
way, just a very little way, just there in

244
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:54,520
your heart, resides the source of all the
beauty. It's just, turn your face towards

245
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:01,520
that. That will work out. I'm sure it will
work out. It's not very far away.

246
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:13,950
(aside) Let her also stand there, she'll enjoy.
Now, another point was that you are going

247
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:42,160
to go to that peace mission or something.
What peace? What is that supposed to be? In

248
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:51,560
Brighton, you are? Peace festival, all right.
And I'm told Kay has written an article about

249
00:36:53,070 --> 00:37:00,070
it, peace. You know that peace is nothing
without. It is within yourself and if you

250
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:08,230
can feel your peace, then only you can start
feeling peace for others. Sahaja Yoga is the

251
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:15,300
only way; there's no other way out.
You see, at the level of, say, take the position

252
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:21,910
of Falkland. Now, let's see, Falkland Island
is a very immediate problem. Now at that level

253
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:28,910
there's no solution. There's no solution.
They are quite justified in attacking back

254
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:35,420
Falkland, because these people were illegally
there, because that's not a democratic country.

255
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,890
They have destroyed so many people of their
own. So, English were justified. Of course

256
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:46,890
My all support was for them, because they
were correct on the justice point. That's

257
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:54,210
true. But, justice is a little half-baked,
because for whom to fight? These unrealized

258
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:06,080
souls, their right, for what? Even if you
have democracy, if it is demonocracy, what

259
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:16,950
is the use of having democracy? I mean, if
through democracy, you are creating only demons,

260
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:23,200
this demonic reign, then what's the use of
having democracy, also?

261
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:30,200
What about this so-called communism? All stupid
people. To My eye, everybody is stupid and

262
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:37,560
they cannot achieve anything at that level.
You can say little bit, "Yes, that's correct.

263
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,560
After all, you see, that was their people
were there under democracy." These people

264
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,950
should have gone because they have killed
so many people. Already Argentina, they have

265
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:50,900
no business and, of course, despotic law is
against, absolutely against Sahaja Yoga. So

266
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:57,900
democracy is the best suited, no doubt. We
have to support democracy. But, even democracy

267
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:05,530
for what? Why to have democracy? To have the
higher freedom. If you cannot have higher

268
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:17,380
freedom, and it just means abandonment, you
see, democracy means that an old man can marry

269
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:24,380
a young girl and all sorts of nonsensical
things. Then better not to have.

270
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:33,290
So democracy is only suitable to people who
are dharmic, who have established their dharma.

271
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:40,290
Otherwise, you really need a communistic country
which will settle down your dharma most, to

272
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:47,120
evolve out of it. But people think that democracy
is for ruining your dharma, you have freedom

273
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:54,120
to ruin your dharma as you like. You see,
"What's wrong?" It's a very, you see, you

274
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,290
cannot say. It's a dilemma again. I don't
know which way to go. It's another dilemma.

275
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:06,290
So, to end up the dilemma you have to talk
to people, that though it might be justified

276
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:15,730
at this time, say Falkland thing, aggression,
it's for peace, because next time they won't

277
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,530
do such a thing again. It's really for peace,
because next time such a thing they may not

278
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:26,000
try, these despots, and there are all these
Germans have gone and settled there. So, is

279
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
a good thing. But, still it's not peace, it
has killed a lot of people. This thing has

280
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,590
happened. Why? Because people are not realized
souls.

281
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:42,590
Come in, come in! Come inside, there's a lot
of space here, move on. All those people who

282
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:50,010
come first should come this side. Can you
move on this side, don't standing up.

283
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:03,140
So, all these political institutions are a
big joke, without realization. They're not

284
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:06,630
yet fully human beings. They're not fully
developed, because they have not found their

285
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:12,490
spirit. You must find your spirit. Unless
and until you found your spirit, no problem

286
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:19,490
is going to be solved. Once your problem is
solved, that is, to find your spirit, all

287
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:26,500
other problems are solved. How now? What will
happen? Let's see. What will happen if we

288
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:34,119
establish a kingdom of the realized souls?
Let's hear... the scholar. What should happen?

289
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:58,369
Of course, everybody will get up early in
the morning, no doubt about it. Apart from

290
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:06,690
that - that's the most difficult thing. Tell
Me. Whatever you say it will happen, so that's

291
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:21,780
what I'm asking.
Yogi: Nobody will attack such a state.

292
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:34,450
Shri Mataji: There won't be any states. You
see, God has not made any states. It's a madness.

293
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,970
I tell you, when I was born, I was surprised.
Oh God, what has happened? You see, God has

294
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:46,000
not made any one of these states. It's a very
different thing than what, you see, I expected.

295
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,400
You see, God has made a beautiful land, all
right, like this one, one sari like that.

296
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,020
Now, you have to have some design, pattern,
so He made some beautiful mountains and some

297
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:03,750
nice, you can say, areas. And some are desert,
some are rich. You see, it's to create ... the

298
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:09,300
whole system, if you see, has worked out in
such a way that you have equator, and you

299
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:15,530
have the sun there, so the winds start moving.
You see, it's all created so beautifully,

300
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:22,030
so you have different types of countries and
different types of places. Now, after creating

301
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:29,030
that, the human beings, stupid as they are,
they divided themselves up. I mean, it is

302
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,890
stupid. I tell you really there is no need
to divide like that. So they created states.

303
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:38,450
There was no need to create a state. But you
see it happened like this: that in the beginning

304
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:45,450
they created state, because they wanted to
have a, you can say, a hut to protect themselves,

305
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:55,760
then a village, then a city, now a state.
Now, after state what is the next situation?

306
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:06,010
The whole world! Collective? This is the breaking
through. Is one world. It is. I believe it

307
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:12,790
is. To Me it's nonsense to see it in so many
...

308
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:19,590
I can't understand walking in the, you see,
this Customs and all that, carrying your passport,

309
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:24,680
that criminal number so and so, and apart
from that you carry your photograph and then

310
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,050
tell so many things. Oh, by the way, My passport
is completely filled now. Have to get another

311
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:33,740
one. It's like that. You see, everywhere you
go, you look like a criminal. They look at

312
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:39,320
your face and then they stamp you. All right,
you are stamped. Go ahead. It's terrible.

313
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,960
It's indignified, absolutely there. That means
the human beings have no dignity left in them.

314
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:50,960
I mean, this land doesn't belong to you at
all. This is a land of God. You are of God

315
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:59,520
and the land is. Nothing belongs to you, actually,
to be very frank. I'm sorry to say, it's true.

316
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:12,710
So, what is a state? This is stateless. But
stateless also means there is state in it.

317
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:19,460
I say this is one world. This is, has been,
is and will be.

318
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:24,790
I mean you may in your myth, you see, hallucination,
think it is different and fight. I sometimes

319
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:31,190
feel you are just fighting your shadows. This
is the, you have created shadows and the shadows

320
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:38,190
are fighting and just to make the shadows
fight, you fight. Otherwise, shadows won't

321
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:44,220
fight. It's all a shadow. There's no truth
in it. To Me it looks like that. It's all

322
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:51,220
madness. What is there to fight? This is one
world. Everybody is blessed by God. They all

323
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:59,280
should enjoy His blessings to enter into the
kingdom of God. He is the King. He is the

324
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:09,270
one who is the ruler. In His kingdom there
is nothing like a state. So that's a very

325
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:18,580
different world you are entering into.
There are no alternatives there. There is

326
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:25,580
only one absolute state of mind where you
become the spirit, that's all. There's not

327
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:35,920
going to be any aggression. It's stupid to
be aggressive. There's not going to be any

328
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,300
suppression. It's stupid to do that. Nobody's
going to be suppressed and nobody's going

329
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:47,300
to take any suppression. Everybody ... Why?
Do you find that in the nature? Nobody does

330
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:56,110
that. It's a harmonious living in the nature,
even in the animal kingdom. You see, they

331
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:03,110
know that a tiger has to live on an animal.
It's all right. That cattle has its own life,

332
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:13,220
finished. Even they can understand the need,
but, human beings don't. Their need is of

333
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:20,220
spirit, and spirit hates, actually hates aggression.
It cannot. It cannot. Even if it wants to,

334
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:29,340
it cannot. It's indignified to aggress anyone,
for a spirit, indignified. Absolutely, it

335
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:38,910
is wretched. So, that is what it is, that
we'll all enjoy love, love of God, His blessings,

336
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:55,990
and all our limitations will drop off. So-called
bhoots, as you call them, they'll all run

337
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:09,490
away.
It's a very different atmosphere of reality.

338
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:17,190
This is all unreal, is absolutely unreal,
is an illusion, I tell you, because you know

339
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:24,220
that Brahma, His divine vibrations are doing
everything. They are working out everything,

340
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:34,290
even material things. Everything they can
achieve. Apart from that, they give you that

341
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:49,710
source of joy which takes you onto that atmosphere
where you exist and enjoy. All the illusions

342
00:48:53,510 --> 00:49:00,510
created by human beings will drop out. This
is all illusion. Believe Me, it's all illusion.

343
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:11,550
There is no truth in it at all. But through
illusion, you can work out.

344
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:23,580
It's a very interesting thing that only through
illusion you can work out, because when I'm

345
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:33,790
talking to you I have to keep an illusion
of being here. Otherwise, you won't pay any

346
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:39,670
attention. You wouldn't see Me; you wouldn't
know Me; you wouldn't talk to Me. So, you

347
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:46,670
have to have an illusion. But, I know this
is illusion. That's all. Living in this world,

348
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:58,660
in this illusion, if you know it's an illusion,
that's done. You are going to be tomorrow's

349
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:06,890
citizens, no doubt, of a very high level quality.
The day will come when they will have to jolly

350
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:16,560
well consult us. Already you have seen how
I am playing tricks on the U.S. Did you hear

351
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:22,210
the way the lady made mistakes, you see, the
stupid things? Did you find that? I saw her

352
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,160
photograph and I said, "Oh, this stupid woman."
She just raised her hand like that.

353
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:31,160
Now they are realizing, you know, they don't
know what happens and then suddenly how they

354
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:41,480
go amok. They'll all go amok and then they
will have to find out how they should be controlled,

355
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:49,080
what has happened, how did it happen. All
these tricks one has to play, with all of

356
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:54,590
them.
Now, after the last war perhaps people may

357
00:50:54,590 --> 00:51:00,150
not come out with very aggressive words, perhaps,
maybe, because it will be unpopular. But they'll

358
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:07,150
do such stupid things, you see, to prove that
they are good for nothing. All this can be

359
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:14,790
done. But, you must know it is an illusion,
all of you, because you are different things.

360
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:21,710
You are seeing through different eyes. You
know is what Brahma is. So, you must know

361
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:28,710
and raise your quality. Raise your quality.
In normal life, supposing, you see, like I'll

362
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:40,119
say that somebody is a peon, then he dresses
up in a particular way. Then he suddenly becomes

363
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:48,670
an officer. Then he becomes a different style,
you see, walks in a different way; his gait

364
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:55,670
changes; style changes.
So, now you have become prophets, whole thing

365
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:02,590
has to change. Either you don't accept this
position, but if you are accepted this position

366
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:09,590
and you are paid for it, then better be that.
I mean, you can't dress up like a peon if

367
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:18,940
you are an officer, can you? It's all illusion,
complete illusion. The whole thing is an illusion.

368
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:34,150
All these kings of yours and queens are like
dolls there before you. Especially Mr. Pope,

369
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:40,119
you see, who came here. My grandson says,
"Mr. Poke came here."

370
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:45,980
I said, "Poke?"
He said, "I'm sorry, Pork. He was talking

371
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:50,040
all rubbish."
I said, "How do you know?"

372
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:57,040
"Because all his chakras were catching."
And he is supposed to be the Pope in charge.

373
00:52:57,619 --> 00:53:03,070
Now, Bishop of Canterbury, see, is another
funny man. I've seen him on the thing. He

374
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:07,980
was agnostic about everything. I don't know
about Christ also, maybe. He said, "I'm agnostic."

375
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:13,640
Any question you ask him, "I'm agnostic."
Is a very good escape he has got, you see.

376
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,660
He's agnostic of about everything, because
he says, "It's a mystery to me." So, what

377
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,350
are you doing there? I mean, if it's a mystery
to you, you're agnostic. I mean, I just don't

378
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:27,350
understand how is he there.
So, some people have taken up upon themselves

379
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:38,600
this crusade, I believe, and to talk to him.
I mean, how can you talk to your shadow? Can

380
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:50,740
you? So, the people live in the shadow state
and you should not symbolize yourself as shadows.

381
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:57,200
You should symbolize yourself as reality and
look at them as shadows, you see. In a way,

382
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:04,200
in a very dignified way, "This is a shadow,
you know." Just pick it up, but, not in an

383
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:11,450
aggressive way, but have compassion about
them. Say, "No, no, sir, this is not so. You

384
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:20,859
are sadly mistaken. This is a shadow of life."
The whole Christianity is doomed because they

385
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:29,820
started running after shadow. This Mr. Saint
Paul, I don't know how he came into Bible.

386
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:34,960
Now, you are a theologist. You tell Me, John.
How did he enter? I mean, anybody who says

387
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:41,960
he saw Christ, is he supposed to enter into
the Bible? How did he? I mean, his saying

388
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:50,720
and his words and his letters are regarded
as the letters from the Bible, after Christ.

389
00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:03,670
Before Christ is all right, but after Christ.
What is the validity? I don't understand.

390
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:11,640
What is the credibility of this person entering
into that as an authority? How? When nobody

391
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:20,210
challenged him. He was a man who was killing
so many people before. Then, suddenly he becomes

392
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,410
something and he starts saying, "I'm doing
Christ's work," and this and that and writes

393
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:27,220
letter to Corinthians and all these people
and all that. And why these letters that he

394
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:34,220
writes becomes a Bible? Can you imagine? What
did he do in his own lifetime? Half of it

395
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:47,340
he spent in killing and half of it is he was
an imposter. I am happy that it has come to

396
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:55,420
your notice. But one can ask, "Why? Why is
he there?"

397
00:55:58,099 --> 00:56:03,160
Now, he started this charismatic thing; he
is doing all this. I first saw it in India.

398
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,980
There's a Saint Paul's Church. They're all
possessed people, you know, and one of My

399
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:11,800
uncles was the priest of that. He was a very
possessed man, very hot-tempered, horrible.

400
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:18,340
And when I saw that, I wanted to see the Saint
Paul's Bible what he has written about. I

401
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:25,340
was amazed. But I said, "Let you people read
and see for yourself." And this horrible charismatic

402
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:34,500
movement is anti-God activity, absolutely
anti-God activity.

403
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:40,330
So, if you have to talk to the gentleman,
you have to tell him about it, that it is

404
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:45,640
possession. The Seventh Day Adventist and
what other is this Pentecost, is nothing but

405
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:50,849
that. Jamaicans are doing, all of them are
great spiritually-developed people - spiritually

406
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:57,849
in the pub. I mean, there should be certain
norms, isn't it, about a person who is supposed

407
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:12,730
to be a prophet or something, something to
do with God, you see. The world is coming

408
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:19,640
to a position where they are understanding;
but you see, once they start disregarding,

409
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:26,640
the danger is this: once they start disregarding
these things, because they are myths and falsehood,

410
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:36,369
they will disregard also God and all the truth
about God. They can become communists. That's

411
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:45,280
the easiest way. Then there is no return.
It's a dangerous situation. When you talk

412
00:57:53,720 --> 00:58:00,260
to him you have to tell him, warn him. Already
your churches are selling here. Nobody goes

413
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:07,260
to church.
Now, about the environment. They are having

414
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:17,400
a meeting on environment. That, too, is only
solved through spirit. All environment problems

415
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:23,010
can be solved only spiritual, if you have
spiritual ascent. Otherwise, you cannot. You

416
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:30,010
try anything; it's like patching up the sky.
See now, it's a very deep-rooted thing that

417
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:39,160
we don't understand that spirit is the most
practical thing. You see, we think spirit,

418
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:46,160
we think it's like a drunkard, you know. Spiritual
man, he's a cult, he's a drunkard, he's most

419
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:51,250
abnormal. He's funny. Either he hits people
or runs away from them. This is the idea we

420
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:58,250
have got about a spiritual personality.
But just see you are spiritual. You will find

421
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:06,930
it impossible to use plastics after some time,
because you will know that the plastics give

422
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:20,090
you horrid vibrations. After some time you
will really find it repulsive. It's all right

423
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:30,180
to sit in a train for a while on a plastic
coach, all right, but, to sit in your house

424
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:37,180
on a plastic all the time would be horrible
and to wear a plastic coat all the time, our

425
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:47,849
body will refuse. So when people will be spiritually
awakened, they'll give up all these nonsensical

426
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,880
things.
So, they may say then, "What will happen to

427
00:59:53,880 --> 01:00:00,880
the machines?" Now, machines are for us; we
are not for the machines. This is another

428
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:06,609
concept is: whatever is created is for us
and we are not for that. All right, doesn't

429
01:00:06,609 --> 01:00:11,599
matter. Nothing will go wrong with the machines.
Machines should be used for anything that

430
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:18,599
is a public work. Like for your motor cars,
for your trains, trams, all public work which

431
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:25,740
is outside. For houses at the most you can
use machines. But, for personal things, you

432
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:34,940
must use handmade things, handmade things.
For spiritual people, you like to wear something

433
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:41,940
that is handmade or real. I can't wear a nylon
sari. Not that I am very fussy about things,

434
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:48,180
but I just can't wear. After some time, if
I do not take out My socks, which are only

435
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:55,180
nylon, what to do? My vibrations get jammed,
completely. So, you won't be able to wear

436
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:04,180
next to your skin, near your skin, near your
body, eating your food, everything in plastics,

437
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:10,380
cooking in plastics. I mean it's too much.
Thank God, cooking I don't think is possible,

438
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:17,190
isn't it? But aluminium is another thing.
It's very bad. Aluminium - you won't be able

439
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:23,700
to use. You'll either try copper or brass,
I think so. Now, handmade things we may have,

440
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:30,170
because they are made by hand, so they have
vibrations. People would like to have handmade.

441
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:36,220
It is a part, so by that we remove the disparity
of the world. Developing countries can do

442
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:43,220
handmade things. You cannot beat them with
computers. Can you? You go ahead, mad with

443
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:52,680
your computers. You'll have to come back.
You must understand the whole. If you don't

444
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:58,119
understand the whole, this is what is happening:
like mad, you know computers are going ahead,

445
01:01:58,119 --> 01:02:05,119
ahead. Where? Into the ditch, into a big mountain.
Now they have created a big mountains of plastic

446
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:16,359
and they don't know what to do with it. So,
and now with computer, what will they do?

447
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:24,710
They'll create a greater mountains out of
plastics. Maybe a Himalaya might be created,

448
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:31,440
with the computer. So the developing countries
should not try to follow these mad people

449
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,050
on one side. They should develop their hand
things and all that, because they'll have

450
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:42,060
to come back. Now, the handmade things in
this country are so important and so expensive.

451
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:47,339
You don't care whether it is pressed or not.
But in India you have to take nylons, because

452
01:02:47,339 --> 01:02:54,339
they say nylons is a symbol of development,
not of over-development, perhaps, but of development.

453
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:03,160
So they must take to nylons and plastics and
to stainless steel and aluminium, if possible.

454
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:08,200
That's what we are doing.
When you have less things consumed like that,

455
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:13,359
you use less things from your motherland,
because handmade you cannot go on mad like

456
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:18,260
a machine goes, like a rakshasa eating away
everything and producing more. She has to

457
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:24,670
live like that. It's not economical. So when
you have handmade things you have more value

458
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:30,490
for your things, you look after them better,
you feel better, you are comfortable and you

459
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:37,490
need not be that smart, you see, machine-made.
That idea of smartness is going down.

460
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:43,260
So, the developing countries should also learn
a lesson. They are going after you. They are

461
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:49,380
running fast. They try to run faster; they
cannot. Thank God, they cannot. But they should

462
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:53,839
stick on to that side. You see, one part of
the country has to do something; another part

463
01:03:53,839 --> 01:04:00,839
has to do something else.
But, you people have to look after the side

464
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:08,550
of machines, all right? I mean, handmade things,
what can you make? Some ceramics, I think

465
01:04:12,069 --> 01:04:18,359
- apologies, some apologies for that. You
better do what you know better and let them

466
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:25,359
do what they can do better and share it. If
this balance is established, there's no aggression.

467
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:36,770
Unemployment can be solved. All the problems
can be solved, if you take to handmade things.

468
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:42,349
You should take to handmade things as far
as possible. Sahaja yogis should use handmade

469
01:04:42,349 --> 01:04:49,349
things. I mean, not the cars, but for their
personal use. Even I would say, soaps that

470
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:58,250
you use are horrid. The soaps that you get
in England are not meant for your skins at

471
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:05,250
all, for sahaja yogis' skin. I can't bear
them. What you have to use is natural soaps

472
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:12,060
that you get from any country you feel like,
but natural soaps, which come from natural

473
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:18,200
oils.
Foods also, natural food you must eat, more

474
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:24,609
natural food, than artificial. All that will
give you a better living and that is called

475
01:05:24,609 --> 01:05:28,970
as alternative, all right. That's alternative
is important, but that doesn't mean you go

476
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:35,839
on a bullock cart. You can export your trains
to India, or your cars to India and get khadi

477
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:42,839
from there. All right? Mutual understanding,
because we are part and parcel of one whole

478
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:50,700
and we just cannot exist by our only growth
because then we become malignant, you see.

479
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:57,570
One cells eats another. You have to. If you
have a machinery, you have to eat other, because

480
01:05:57,570 --> 01:06:01,200
you produce so much. You must find markets
for them, you must supply them, you must send

481
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:06,560
over and then you must have other countries
to exploit them.

482
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,200
People have tremendous respect for Mahatma
Gandhi, but I don't know if people understand

483
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:15,390
what he said about machinery. That doesn't
mean the people who are doing machine work

484
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:22,390
should give up, by any chance, but, some of
them they can close down. For example, plastic

485
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:29,710
toys for children is horrifying. You can't
even get wood toys now - nothing, just plastic.

486
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:36,480
They are touching plastic. I mean, imagine,
you cannot feel any plastic.

487
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:43,480
So, this is what a sane sahaja yogi has to
understand. That's how you can solve the problem

488
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:53,250
of environment, also. Thank God, somehow with
your affluence and too much of machinery,

489
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:06,390
all the western people - I am happy to know,
even in Portugal - realize the value of handmade

490
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:13,820
things. But in India if you offer somebody
in an handmade thing they'll say, "Oh God,

491
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:20,869
they have no money." But stainless steel,
"Great." In a stainless steel, glass they'll

492
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:30,890
give you tea, you see - it's very big. If
you give it in a ceramic, "Oh, what this,

493
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:37,890
village craft?"
They are to be told. But, if you create a

494
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:42,820
demand, they'll be all right; they'll look
after their handmade. And here you can't do

495
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:47,710
much. I've seen, you see, that neatness, that
deftness is not there; that's lacking; now

496
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:52,470
they've lost it. Very few people have that
left in them. Even if they have to cut one

497
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:59,070
coat with their hands, they cannot do it.
They have to use a machine, which cuts twenty-five

498
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:06,070
coats at a time, you see.
Then this problem of, you have to have a figure

499
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:10,700
exactly because these only can fit certain
figures. You can't have your own independent

500
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:15,250
figure. This is all machine-like stuff, you
see. You all must have that figure, otherwise

501
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:20,259
doesn't fit it. So, that is an ideal figure.
So, everybody works out for that. See, there's

502
01:08:20,259 --> 01:08:26,799
a new machinery comes up, you see, for that
kind of a thing, then new styles come up.

503
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:30,909
It's such an artificial thing, all man-made,
artificial.

504
01:08:30,909 --> 01:08:37,909
From your democracy, your politics to your
economics, to all your so-called ideas of

505
01:08:41,959 --> 01:08:48,749
creativity, everything becomes so artificial.
Now people can't paint. What they paint, if

506
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:55,749
you see, you are just aghast. You don't know
what is this supposed to be. And it is supposed

507
01:08:55,829 --> 01:09:02,359
to be so that it looks, "There's a hand, isn't
it? Can't you see that?" "Yes, I can. It's

508
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:09,359
a little bit showing." They can't do anything.
We can't have Shakespeare, we can't have Gauguin,

509
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:22,779
we can't have anyone of that type. We can't
have, say, Abraham Lincoln. You can have only

510
01:09:28,829 --> 01:09:34,009
machines, you see, bolts and nuts, fitted
nicely. You're fixed, you're fixed, you're

511
01:09:34,009 --> 01:09:39,469
fixed, you're fixed. Everybody fixed nicely.
Where do, I mean, this brain go? Where will

512
01:09:39,469 --> 01:09:46,469
this heart go? What will it do then? It cannot
collapse. I mean, as long as you are existing,

513
01:09:46,469 --> 01:09:53,469
the heart has to beat. 01:09:53 So all this
artificiality has to be overcome by sahaja

514
01:09:55,099 --> 01:10:02,099
yogis. The responsibility is so great. Such
a big building you have to bear on your shoulders,

515
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:13,769
and the foundation stones have to get up in
the morning to be chiseled out properly. So,

516
01:10:16,929 --> 01:10:23,929
I end up My lecture today. May God bless you!
Now I am getting self-conscious. Will you

517
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:33,360
please put it off? All right. Now, today I
have come specially to discuss about ...
