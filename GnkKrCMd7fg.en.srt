00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:05,001
Public Program Day 1, Seekers are the Highest Creation

2
00:00:05,274 --> 00:00:09,022
Heartwood Community Center, Santa Cruz (United States)
17-10-1981

3
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:42,950
I am very fortunate and I am very happy that
I could come to Santa Cruz.

4
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:54,830
I can see what I am facing is the ocean of
Love, the seekers of Love, the people who

5
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,120
are seeking the Truth.

6
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:04,699
Gregoire has told you all these things because
he is very earnest, he is very concerned,

7
00:20:04,724 --> 00:20:10,120
he knows you are seekers and that’s why
he has told you in these words, so don’t

8
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
be frightened.

9
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,580
There is nothing to be frightened about anything.

10
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:22,370
You are seekers and you are a special category.

11
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:28,080
In the eyes of God, seekers are the highest
creation that He has created.

12
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,090
You are the highest of all.

13
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:46,500
To Him it does not matter who are rich, who
are in power, who are leading a life of so-called

14
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
success.

15
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,190
It does not matter to Him at all, He does
not understand that, He does not know that.

16
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:57,180
Christ has said that these people if they
want gold, let them have.

17
00:20:57,461 --> 00:21:01,640
They’ll have bars of gold and live with
it.

18
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:16,000
But “if they seek Me, if they love Me,”
then these people who are seekers today are

19
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,180
going to enter into the Kingdom of God and
He will eat with them.

20
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:26,980
They will sit at the same table.

21
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,540
You are respected because you are seekers.

22
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,760
You are loved because you are seekers.

23
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:41,910
And you have survived despite all the attacks
on you.

24
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,903
These are all attacks.

25
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:49,380
You are naîve, you are simple, you were innocent
at that time when attacks came in.

26
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,519
Now gradually you are discovering that it
was an attack.

27
00:21:54,722 --> 00:22:00,240
Everything that you did was just to put you
down.

28
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:08,800
And one person who was negative of that kind
would come forward and assert and use all

29
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,460
the negative forces to push you down.

30
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,320
To me you are my children.

31
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:28,320
To me I don’t think what you have done because
you didn’t meet me that time.

32
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,740
I take the load upon myself.

33
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,789
I did come to San Jose last time.

34
00:22:35,328 --> 00:22:44,020
They said that there are lots of seekers settling
down in Santa Cruz.

35
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:56,410
I wanted to come and see you here that time
only, but the experience I had of the people

36
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:01,170
who were there, I thought, “They are not
just now seeking God, but they are sort of

37
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:10,270
seeking ego or superego, they are seeking
into a new style of life and a new style of

38
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,330
understanding, because they have found out
that material life is of no value, it’s

39
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:17,100
not going to give them joy."

40
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,174
At that time, when I said that, and you are
thinking of these things, how can you pay

41
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,254
for it?

42
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,330
Nobody could understand these things.

43
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:31,056
It was very difficult to talk to them – that
it is spontaneous, it is your own right, that

44
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:32,990
you have to get it.

45
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,440
You have been seeking for ages now, not only
in this life time.

46
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,800
You have been saints in many lives and now
you are born here to seek it.

47
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,660
It’s so simple as that.

48
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,300
It has to happen, that’s your nature, that’s
what you are.

49
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:57,030
You try anything else, you won’t be satisfied
‘till you have found out the Truth.

50
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,840
But that time nobody would listen to me.

51
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:06,440
It was a very funny situation and I ultimately
decided that let them find out for themselves

52
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,920
to begin with.

53
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,730
When they will find it out, they have to reach
the right conclusion.

54
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:20,760
Because there is one problem in the seeking,
that you have to seek in your own freedom,

55
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,480
in your own glory of your own choice.

56
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,130
Because if you are to be liberated, it has
to be a free choice.

57
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:36,880
If a person is not free, say, he is enticed
or he is hypnotised or he is overpowered by

58
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,010
others, he has no freedom at all of any kind.

59
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,840
Such a person is useless to enter into the
Kingdom of God.

60
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:52,040
If you have to become the King, then you have
to have that basic freedom in yourself intact.

61
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:58,690
But freedom doesn’t mean ego by any chance.

62
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:05,380
If you think: “I like it, I love it, I do
it,” that’s not the Spirit.

63
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,450
You are not seekers of ego, I must tell you
very frankly, you are not.

64
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:15,350
You are seekers of Truth, of Love, of Joy.

65
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,390
For ages you’ve been seeking that.

66
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:25,550
Joy is the result when you get to that position
where you become your Spirit, your Atma.

67
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:30,700
You should be in Joy, not talking about it,
but enjoying it.

68
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,570
And that has to happen to you.

69
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,380
It’s a happening for which you have built
in for ages.

70
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:44,973
Today, in general, I will tell you what you
are really and what you have to expect.

71
00:25:44,997 --> 00:25:47,222
To become what?

72
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:48,980
Nobody has told you about it.

73
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,200
They said, “All right, you’ll come to
us into a new age."

74
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,220
“All right,” people said.

75
00:25:55,245 --> 00:25:59,509
“Let’s go and join!” Somebody says that
you’ll get this.

76
00:25:59,534 --> 00:26:01,263
You joined.

77
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:10,140
William Blake is one of the greatest prophets
of the modern times.

78
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:18,178
For you Western people, he said that “The
men of God,” that means you people.

79
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:19,922
You are people of God.

80
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:22,510
You are not of this gross level.

81
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,570
If people don’t understand you that does
not mean that I don’t understand.

82
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,980
I know you, what you are.

83
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,917
I know what it is, I can feel it.

84
00:26:34,214 --> 00:26:41,100
He said, “Men of God will become prophets,
and these prophets will have powers to make

85
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,660
others prophets."

86
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:54,915
This is what we have to expect within ourselves.

87
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:10,021
So you have to become the prophet and you
have to make others prophet.

88
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:18,200
Now this is the point you should judge: Have
you become the prophet?

89
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,495
What is a prophet?

90
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:32,030
Prophet is a person who can feel the all-pervading
power around.

91
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,244
Now I said there is all-pervading power of
Love.

92
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:41,530
Oh you also sing the song, they say, “Yes,
there is all-pervading power."

93
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:46,470
Many people also feel that they are feeling
it, but it’s not true.

94
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,539
We have to be honest to ourselves because
we are seekers, we should not cheat ourselves

95
00:27:51,564 --> 00:27:57,201
because this is ego that makes you cheat.

96
00:27:57,226 --> 00:27:59,540
This intelligence is the worst thing.

97
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:04,738
Gregoire himself told me one day, “I find
my intelligence is trying to cheat me."

98
00:28:04,763 --> 00:28:06,910
Very intelligently.

99
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:15,754
So one has to be very careful to understand
that you have to become that.

100
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:19,418
You are the loser, you are the loser. Nobody else.

101
00:28:19,754 --> 00:28:27,520
If you play around with your ego, your superego,
your conditionings or mesmerism or hypnosis,

102
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,015
and your ideas about having a kind of life,
you are the loser.

103
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:37,520
All that could be a great barrier to be the
Spirit, which is a different thing altogether,

104
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,320
is beyond this.

105
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:47,800
So when you become the Spirit, what happens
to you, what should you expect?

106
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:55,491
Of course it’s true that this all-pervading
power is there.

107
00:28:56,225 --> 00:29:01,990
Now if I say there are lots of plays going on
here, there is a music going on here, you

108
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,974
won’t believe.

109
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,845
If I bring the television and say, “Now,
this is the one which is going to show you."

110
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:08,737
You will say, “Oh."

111
00:29:08,762 --> 00:29:09,878
I mean, you know it.

112
00:29:09,903 --> 00:29:13,446
But in India, if I take it to a village who
has never seen a television, they’ll say,

113
00:29:13,471 --> 00:29:14,460
“This box?

114
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,480
How can it do it?” But you put it to the
mains and fantastic things can happen.

115
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,260
It catches all that.

116
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:32,360
In the same way, when you become that, when
you get a little breakthrough, it’s just

117
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,870
the plugging to the mains.

118
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:38,293
You are all ready for that.

119
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,700
And the fantastic thing happens.

120
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,580
First you start feeling it all around.

121
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,300
Now don’t jump into ego.

122
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,260
That’s not the end of it.

123
00:29:49,532 --> 00:29:53,402
You first start feeling it.

124
00:29:53,427 --> 00:30:02,777
Then you start understanding that your centres
are on your fingertips.

125
00:30:02,821 --> 00:30:07,438
It means that you are the master of that.

126
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:10,678
And then you start feeling around

127
00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:13,455
and you know it is there

128
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:18,395
Then I´m here jus to decode it, to tell you,
this is what this finger mean "this"

129
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,580
You verify it.

130
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:25,140
It is so much surprising when people verify
it.

131
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,980
There was a gentleman in London.

132
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:38,070
I had seven hippies in London and I worked
on them for four years, English people are

133
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,950
a little difficult to crack.

134
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:49,650
But after four years they really got their
realization in a proper way and after that

135
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:55,730
now we have thousands of people who are realized
in England.

136
00:30:55,730 --> 00:31:01,130
Because once they find something, then they
get to it.

137
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:04,300
They’re not the people who are shifty.

138
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:09,190
Somehow they have that much wisdom, that balance
in them.

139
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:16,490
They understand that if you have found a little
water in a place, then go on digging there

140
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,900
alone to have the well.

141
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,180
They don’t leave that and go to another
place and dig well and dig well and dig well.

142
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,110
They can know where to stop.

143
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:32,060
So these people were very skeptical in the
beginning.

144
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:41,170
One of them got Realization and he said, “Mother,
it is all pervading, it has got telecommunication

145
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,507
and everything.

146
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:50,362
What about my Father who has not telephoned
to me and who always writes to me and has

147
00:31:50,387 --> 00:31:51,440
not written to me?

148
00:31:51,465 --> 00:31:53,254
He’s in Scotland."

149
00:31:53,254 --> 00:31:55,557
I said, “You trunk call him just now."

150
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,192
I said, “You feel it.

151
00:31:57,614 --> 00:32:00,084
Just put your hands like that."

152
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,944
And he said,”I am getting a burning here."

153
00:32:02,944 --> 00:32:08,634
I said:”That means he must be down with
very bad bronchitis.

154
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:14,503
These are the centers of your father and this
is the finger which denotes this center.

155
00:32:14,528 --> 00:32:16,488
You telephone to him and find out."

156
00:32:16,513 --> 00:32:23,883
He telephoned to him and the mother said exactly
the same centers, that he’s down with very

157
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,257
bad bronchitis.

158
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:29,203
This could be a cock and bull story.

159
00:32:29,228 --> 00:32:40,374
The way Gregoire was telling you, he was trying
to establish my credibility to you, because

160
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:44,934
it is such an apologetic condition in which
I have come.

161
00:32:44,934 --> 00:32:48,824
It‘s a very funny situation, I know that.

162
00:32:48,824 --> 00:32:54,004
The other day I went to see a very influential
Indian man.

163
00:32:54,004 --> 00:32:58,004
Of course, he knows me, because of my husband
maybe.

164
00:32:58,004 --> 00:33:04,694
He knows that a person of that status may
not come to this level of cheating others,

165
00:33:04,694 --> 00:33:05,694
whatever it is.

166
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:16,084
But still he told me that he can’t understand
how people are taking to these horrible gurus

167
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:22,404
and how these gurus came and cheated me also
and I helped them.

168
00:33:22,404 --> 00:33:35,524
In Sahaja Yoga, it’s a spontaneous happening,
a living happening.

169
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:41,543
You are a living being and the force of God
is also living.

170
00:33:41,543 --> 00:33:54,279
Just like a fruit comes out of a flower, just
like this living process takes place, you

171
00:33:54,304 --> 00:33:56,404
become your Spirit.

172
00:33:57,154 --> 00:34:03,446
We never think this thing is around us, every
day we see.

173
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:06,149
This is worked out by this all pervading Power.

174
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:10,414
We can’t do even with one flower.

175
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:14,846
We cannot transform even one flower into a
fruit.

176
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:16,876
We take it for granted.

177
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:20,109
We never know that all such living things
are done.

178
00:34:20,134 --> 00:34:21,334
Now look at it.

179
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:25,134
There is a little bird, which lays the egg.

180
00:34:25,134 --> 00:34:26,204
For what?

181
00:34:26,204 --> 00:34:29,824
The eggs are kept in the nest.

182
00:34:29,824 --> 00:34:37,844
The all pervading Power works it out in such
a way that the eggs grow and the bird hatches

183
00:34:37,844 --> 00:34:44,594
them and from these eggs comes out a bird.

184
00:34:44,594 --> 00:34:48,444
We have seen caterpillars turning into butterflies.

185
00:34:48,444 --> 00:34:50,824
We never think how it happens.

186
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:53,194
We just take it for granted.

187
00:34:53,194 --> 00:34:54,774
We enjoy their colors.

188
00:34:54,774 --> 00:35:02,514
We never see how this transformation has taken
place and this transmutation has taken place.

189
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:09,444
In Sanskrit language a realized soul is called
as dwijaha, is the one who is born twice.

190
00:35:09,444 --> 00:35:11,574
Of course, this is also another problem.

191
00:35:11,574 --> 00:35:16,012
Last time I said you are to be born actually
again.

192
00:35:16,037 --> 00:35:17,587
It is a living process.

193
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:24,774
The Kundalini has to move throughout the centers
and you have to feel the actualization of

194
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:29,954
your Realization, meaning that you must feel
the cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle

195
00:35:29,954 --> 00:35:31,334
bone area.

196
00:35:31,334 --> 00:35:33,244
Realization you have to feel.

197
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:38,194
It’s an actualization, not a vague belief,
I told them hundred times.

198
00:35:38,194 --> 00:35:41,194
And they were taping me.

199
00:35:41,194 --> 00:35:43,624
Some people told me, ”Mother, don’t allow
them to tape."

200
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:46,204
I said, “Let them tape! What’s the matter?

201
00:35:46,204 --> 00:35:48,144
I am not running any enterprise."

202
00:35:48,144 --> 00:35:53,694
They said, “No, they will use it for some
purpose."

203
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,074
I said, “Let them use it.

204
00:35:55,074 --> 00:35:57,764
For what purpose they are going to use I don’t
understand."

205
00:35:57,764 --> 00:35:59,734
I don’t understand these human laws.

206
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:02,114
I am very bad at it.

207
00:36:02,114 --> 00:36:05,944
And human beings I am also worse.

208
00:36:05,944 --> 00:36:11,494
These people met me the other day in Sydney
after so many years.

209
00:36:11,494 --> 00:36:14,699
They have branded themselves as born again.

210
00:36:14,724 --> 00:36:19,864
And they just self-certificated that we are
born again.

211
00:36:19,864 --> 00:36:21,874
I said, ”But how?”

212
00:36:21,874 --> 00:36:24,384
“But we are born again."

213
00:36:24,384 --> 00:36:30,044
“But what is the proof that you are born
again, my children?

214
00:36:30,044 --> 00:36:31,754
How do you believe you are born again?

215
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:34,284
There must be some proof of it.

216
00:36:34,284 --> 00:36:35,374
“Oh, we are born again.

217
00:36:35,374 --> 00:36:36,374
Finished."

218
00:36:36,374 --> 00:36:39,394
Now, you cannot self-certify yourself.

219
00:36:39,394 --> 00:36:42,674
If you do that, it is Ego.

220
00:36:42,674 --> 00:36:43,814
Understand that.

221
00:36:43,814 --> 00:36:51,544
If you are born again, you should be able
to feel the centers of other people, you should

222
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:59,224
be able to feel your own centers, you should
be able to judge yourself and cure yourself

223
00:36:59,224 --> 00:37:01,054
and you could cure others.

224
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:06,694
Not only that, but you can raise their Kundalini
and give them Realization.

225
00:37:06,694 --> 00:37:14,034
This is the minimum of minimums to them.

226
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:17,924
I mean an egg, if it is chanting, “I am
a bird,” does it become?

227
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:20,796
It’s an egg and an egg is an egg.

228
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,569
If it says, “Oh, I am
a bird."

229
00:37:22,594 --> 00:37:24,323
It can’t fly.

230
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:29,046
It has to really fly.

231
00:37:29,078 --> 00:37:30,949
If you tell the egg:

232
00:37:31,037 --> 00:37:34,942
"Mrs egg, would you please fly?"

233
00:37:35,822 --> 00:37:39,234
Some of the nursery rhymes are Humpty Dumpty
sat on the wall.

234
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:41,744
That’s what they are.

235
00:37:41,744 --> 00:37:44,604
They believe that they are great people.

236
00:37:44,604 --> 00:37:50,614
They sat on the wall and when they fell down,
all the King’s horses and all the King’s

237
00:37:50,614 --> 00:37:53,446
men could not put them together again.

238
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,138
This is what it is,

239
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:58,854
this is a make believe, that we are born again.

240
00:37:58,854 --> 00:38:02,954
But it’s of no use to you.

241
00:38:02,954 --> 00:38:04,714
You are Seekers.

242
00:38:04,714 --> 00:38:07,954
You are nothing but Seekers of Spirit.

243
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:10,874
Accept that situation, first of all.

244
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:12,664
Accept your Self.

245
00:38:12,664 --> 00:38:18,795
These false certificates are not going to
help you, by any chance.

246
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:24,484
Again I go away, you find another Guru, get
after him, get after another, get after another

247
00:38:24,484 --> 00:38:25,484
one.

248
00:38:25,484 --> 00:38:27,714
Some of them just end up into a lunatic Asylum.

249
00:38:27,714 --> 00:38:31,484
I don’t know what to do with them.

250
00:38:31,484 --> 00:38:38,674
When this happens to you, physically you feel
all right.

251
00:38:38,674 --> 00:38:42,114
I mean cancers can only be cured through your
Kundalini awakening.

252
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:45,044
I’ve been saying this for the last ten years.

253
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:49,364
I’ve also cured cancer automatically of
people as a by product.

254
00:38:49,364 --> 00:38:54,114
All diseases get cured.-That is the minimum
of minimum that should happen to you.

255
00:38:54,114 --> 00:39:00,674
After all, Realization is not some sort of
a cheap thing you can buy in the market like

256
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:03,964
a take away food.

257
00:39:03,964 --> 00:39:11,164
It is your Spirit, which is an eternal Being,
which you achieve.

258
00:39:11,164 --> 00:39:12,594
You achieve your absolute value.

259
00:39:12,594 --> 00:39:18,634
You become that though it happens so spontaneously,
so easily that you can’t believe.

260
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:20,244
You have no self esteem.

261
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:23,290
You can’t believe it that you have really
got it in the beginning.

262
00:39:23,315 --> 00:39:25,335
People just don’t believe it.

263
00:39:25,994 --> 00:39:29,040
It is impossible, they can believe it
that this has happened.

264
00:39:29,073 --> 00:39:33,200
And when they don’t believe it, they don’t
want to practice it any further.

265
00:39:33,225 --> 00:39:35,169
It’s so surprising.

266
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:45,067
First you have to get the sprouting of Kundalini
and then you have to allow it to grow and

267
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:51,022
once you grow into it, then you are like a
tree.

268
00:39:51,047 --> 00:39:53,295
As Gregoire says it’s true.

269
00:39:53,320 --> 00:40:02,840
He was here in Santa Cruz, went to Berkeley,
there he met a very good Sahaja Yogi from

270
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:06,655
India and just came down to London.

271
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:09,488
That time I saw him and I said, “Look at
this Seeker coming down."

272
00:40:09,488 --> 00:40:16,248
I went to receive him at the station and I
was surprised – he was so frantic, he was

273
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:21,858
so upset and I was surprised that the centers…
I know what he was.

274
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:23,638
He is a Seeker, I know that.

275
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:27,218
That had such love, and such feeling.

276
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:28,758
I said, “ Look at this my child.

277
00:40:28,758 --> 00:40:29,758
Where is he lost?

278
00:40:29,758 --> 00:40:34,058
What has happened to you?”

279
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:39,458
Now, we have to know what we are, what we
have to achieve and where we are to go.

280
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:40,458
That’s an important thing.

281
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:45,069
As I have told you, you must know what you
have to achieve, what you get.

282
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:46,563
In a very gross way I’ve told you.

283
00:40:46,563 --> 00:40:54,709
Actually, it’s so dynamic, it is so fantastic
that if I tell you any more stories of it,

284
00:40:54,803 --> 00:40:58,638
you’d say it’s really a cock and bull
story.

285
00:40:58,663 --> 00:41:00,253
But there is God.

286
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:08,633
He’s there, no doubt and He is dynamic and
He is all powerful and that He is all Love

287
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:13,413
and that He loves you so much that he wants
you to enjoy His Kingdom.

288
00:41:13,413 --> 00:41:16,053
It’s true, no doubt about it.

289
00:41:16,053 --> 00:41:21,113
I am here to prove everything to you, not
to talk and give sermons and all that, but

290
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:24,243
to prove it to you.

291
00:41:24,243 --> 00:41:35,286
And his Powers are so fantastic, at every
level how they work out is amazing.

292
00:41:35,311 --> 00:41:38,313
You have to just become.

293
00:41:38,313 --> 00:41:40,073
Becoming is the main thing.

294
00:41:40,073 --> 00:41:47,453
Now, as far as I am concerned, I am Your Mother.

295
00:41:47,453 --> 00:41:52,583
You have every right on me.

296
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:57,163
I shouldn’t say I am your guru because I
am only here to connect you to your Self and

297
00:41:57,188 --> 00:42:01,209
you become your own guru, you
don't need any Guru anymore.

298
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:04,703
Once you are connected to the mains you become
your own guru.

299
00:42:04,703 --> 00:42:07,083
You know this Warren Reeves, Dr.

300
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:08,083
Warren Reeves.

301
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:16,203
He came to me and I had to stick on to him
because he was all the time running away.

302
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:22,083
He has been to so many gurus who pampered
his ego –-”Oh, you are a great seeker,”

303
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:24,383
“You are already a realized soul."

304
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:31,463
All these things are sticking onto his head
and it was very difficult to get him together.

305
00:42:31,463 --> 00:42:34,243
And also I do not work in the city.

306
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:38,873
I actually work in the villages of India where
really thousands of people have got realization.

307
00:42:38,873 --> 00:42:42,893
We have seen six thousand people get their
Self realization at a time.

308
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:51,543
But Indians are wise people and they are the
people who do not indulge into extremes.

309
00:42:51,543 --> 00:42:55,443
In their seeking also they are wise and they
know what to expect.

310
00:42:55,443 --> 00:42:58,703
So, it’s easy for me to work out.

311
00:42:58,703 --> 00:43:06,069
They are innocent people still not exposed
to the material things that you have.

312
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:08,297
Though you’ve denied it, but you can’t
help it.

313
00:43:08,322 --> 00:43:09,622
Your brain is modern.

314
00:43:09,662 --> 00:43:11,992
You may try to look like primitive people.

315
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:13,012
The brain is modern.

316
00:43:13,012 --> 00:43:14,152
What can you do?

317
00:43:14,152 --> 00:43:16,372
Think, think, think, think, think.

318
00:43:16,372 --> 00:43:20,542
Just by changing your brain, you do not become
that.

319
00:43:20,575 --> 00:43:22,519
This is the point we should know.

320
00:43:22,543 --> 00:43:27,964
So, it’s easy there to work it out and in
the Indian villages you don’t even get sometimes

321
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,748
a car to move out.

322
00:43:29,748 --> 00:43:35,512
You have to go in a bullock cart and there
is no bathroom, you have to go to the river.

323
00:43:35,537 --> 00:43:39,335
It’s all right for a change or holiday,
but when you have to be with me three months

324
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,037
like that, it was too much for him.

325
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:47,664
But still he managed and now you will be amazed,
he has established seven centers in seven

326
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:49,739
cities in Australia.

327
00:43:50,536 --> 00:43:56,497
If you ask him how many people he has given
realization, he will say, “I don’t remember."

328
00:43:56,522 --> 00:44:00,604
So, one light which has been enlightened,
can enlighten another light.

329
00:44:00,629 --> 00:44:04,567
But the first light has to be an enlightened
light.

330
00:44:04,592 --> 00:44:09,741
Once you say that you are enlightened, everybody’s
ego starts coming up.

331
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:12,856
It’s very common with the Western people.

332
00:44:12,881 --> 00:44:17,574
Every time I went to some place they said,
“Why you of all the things, Mother?”

333
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,113
I said, “It’s all right.

334
00:44:19,138 --> 00:44:21,448
You come along, It’s a good idea.

335
00:44:21,473 --> 00:44:23,163
I would like to retire."

336
00:44:23,188 --> 00:44:26,868
I said, “My husband would pay a man who
can do my job.

337
00:44:26,893 --> 00:44:34,173
It’s a thankless job to work for days and
nights together and he will be very happy

338
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,115
to do that for you."

339
00:44:54,874 --> 00:45:04,024
This problem of becoming is not yours, is
mine for the time being.

340
00:45:04,415 --> 00:45:07,357
When you become that, then it is yours.

341
00:45:07,382 --> 00:45:11,560
Once I know how to swim I can save you.

342
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:16,335
If I do not know how to swim how can I make
you swim?

343
00:45:16,335 --> 00:45:19,855
When you learn how to swim you can also save
other people.

344
00:45:19,855 --> 00:45:20,855
It’s very simple.

345
00:45:20,855 --> 00:45:24,715
But even if you say it is saving, people get
frightened.

346
00:45:24,715 --> 00:45:27,665
No, it’s becoming.

347
00:45:27,665 --> 00:45:29,575
It’s what you are.

348
00:45:29,575 --> 00:45:32,495
To get to that is the point.

349
00:45:32,495 --> 00:45:40,365
I would like to tell you what we are and what
is going to happen to us when we become realized

350
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:41,365
souls.

351
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:44,135
It’s a gross manifestation of the powers
I told you.

352
00:45:44,135 --> 00:45:50,206
When you became human beings you got your
awareness in a different way than the animals

353
00:45:50,231 --> 00:45:53,175
have, because for the animals, for example,
they do not understand the beauty of this

354
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,089
room.

355
00:45:54,114 --> 00:45:55,114
They won’t.

356
00:45:55,139 --> 00:46:00,263
They don’t understand anything that is filthy
or dirty, they have no smell power.

357
00:46:00,288 --> 00:46:01,731
Somehow they’ve managed.

358
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:06,098
They can live under any circumstances without
smelling anything.

359
00:46:06,123 --> 00:46:10,698
We don’t have to learn anything from animals.

360
00:46:10,698 --> 00:46:17,848
We are on top of all the creation and we have
to assume our position.

361
00:46:17,848 --> 00:46:25,101
Once you have assumed your position, you become
that and once you become that, then you will

362
00:46:25,126 --> 00:46:27,781
be surprised to see how fantastic you are.

363
00:46:27,806 --> 00:46:30,366
That is the discovery you have to have.

364
00:46:31,215 --> 00:46:36,965
Within ourselves I think all of you got this
unique discovery so it’s easy for you to

365
00:46:36,965 --> 00:46:39,025
see what I’m about to say.

366
00:46:39,025 --> 00:46:44,465
You will be amazed this lecture which I gave
about ten years back in India to begin with

367
00:46:44,465 --> 00:46:46,249
after there have been many lectures.

368
00:46:46,274 --> 00:46:48,190
But if you have this is a good idea.

369
00:46:48,215 --> 00:46:49,909
You can go home and see for yourself.

370
00:46:49,934 --> 00:46:52,021
But you also have a little pamphlet.

371
00:46:54,281 --> 00:46:59,660
On the back side is the complete picture of
the Kundalini.

372
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:24,525
Now, this is the God, the Primordial Being,
who has made you in His own image.

373
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:29,985
But still there’s the reflector, the human
being, which is not complete.

374
00:47:29,985 --> 00:47:41,515
Within us lies this subtle mechanism, which
is called the tantra.

375
00:47:41,515 --> 00:47:50,565
This is the real tantra, holy tantra, is an
auspicious thing, which gives us righteousness.

376
00:47:50,565 --> 00:47:53,947
You see, when we think of the tantrikas, they
are the worst of all.

377
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,696
They make money,

378
00:47:55,697 --> 00:48:00,323
they do all kinds of violence, they teach
all kinds of nonsensical things.

379
00:48:00,348 --> 00:48:04,235
I mean they indulge into any kind of sex.

380
00:48:04,235 --> 00:48:07,326
They use your women, they use your money,
they do all kinds of things.

381
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:20,805
This is the holy mechanism, this is the pure
mechanism, is the purity, is completely pure

382
00:48:20,805 --> 00:48:24,187
Love, is not biased.

383
00:48:24,212 --> 00:48:33,722
This mechanism exists within you and expresses
itself outside in the gross also to a great

384
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,683
extent.

385
00:48:35,975 --> 00:48:55,621
It expresses itself, on the left-hand side,
as the power of your Desire (iccha shakti).

386
00:48:55,646 --> 00:49:03,635
This expresses itself within us as our emotions,
as our psyche.

387
00:49:03,635 --> 00:49:08,675
Gregoire has rightly said that Freud was quite
half-baked because he knew only one part of

388
00:49:08,675 --> 00:49:11,998
the human being and that, too, was very little
of the psyche.

389
00:49:12,023 --> 00:49:15,716
Because all the scientists see things from
outside in.

390
00:49:15,741 --> 00:49:20,940
If you see a tree from outside, if there is
something wrong with the leaf, you try to

391
00:49:20,965 --> 00:49:22,206
treat the leaf.

392
00:49:22,231 --> 00:49:26,433
But how to treat the whole tree is through
the roots.

393
00:49:26,511 --> 00:49:35,315
So you go to the roots of your being and these
are the roots.

394
00:49:35,315 --> 00:49:44,105
One side of it is the Power of Desire and
it works out after the first center.

395
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:48,747
I’ll be telling you tomorrow morning about
these centers.

396
00:49:48,787 --> 00:49:55,982
The another power is the power of action,
which enacts your Desire

397
00:49:56,006 --> 00:49:58,006
whick works out your desire.

398
00:49:58,555 --> 00:50:00,785
this yellow color.

399
00:50:00,785 --> 00:50:05,071
This gives you your future.

400
00:50:05,157 --> 00:50:10,660
You enter into your future by your planning,
by your thinking, for working out.

401
00:50:10,685 --> 00:50:14,574
The left side gives you your past.

402
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:23,105
It goes on accumulating on the left-hand side
and the deeper you move on the left-hand side

403
00:50:23,105 --> 00:50:25,385
there is the collective subconscious.

404
00:50:25,385 --> 00:50:29,185
First the subconscious and then the collective
subconscious.

405
00:50:29,185 --> 00:50:37,433
Now this is very important to know that when
we indulge too much into the left subconscious,

406
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:44,495
that is a very dangerous situation, as well
as if you move into your right-hand side is

407
00:50:44,495 --> 00:50:52,645
the supra conscious and then to the collective
supraconscious, is also a very dangerous situation.

408
00:50:52,645 --> 00:51:00,085
Moving into the left and the right is the
easy thing for human beings to do because

409
00:51:00,085 --> 00:51:07,945
if you want to do something, if you try to
do something about it and if you are not spontaneous,

410
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:09,920
what happens?

411
00:51:09,945 --> 00:51:17,665
That your sympathetic nervous system, which is
governed by this subtle energy, goes into

412
00:51:17,665 --> 00:51:22,765
action and you either move into the left side
or into the right side.

413
00:51:22,765 --> 00:51:29,775
For example, if you want to run, as these
days many people are just running, (You can

414
00:51:29,775 --> 00:51:32,672
run once in a while, but all the time running
– what is the need?

415
00:51:32,697 --> 00:51:35,135
Human beings are delicate things.

416
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:41,715
The way we go headlong into everything like
a bull in a china shop is not necessary.

417
00:51:41,715 --> 00:51:46,705
The way you ruin yourself also, because you
think this body is your own, do what you like.

418
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:49,335
You must respect your body.

419
00:51:49,335 --> 00:51:56,235
This is the Temple of God.) So, when you start
overdoing something on the left or the right

420
00:51:56,235 --> 00:52:01,795
side, say some people are crying, weeping,
singing praise of death and all that, so have

421
00:52:01,795 --> 00:52:02,795
it.

422
00:52:02,795 --> 00:52:05,015
Some people say we must suffer.

423
00:52:05,015 --> 00:52:08,135
Alright, then you suffer, have Hitler on top
of your head.

424
00:52:08,135 --> 00:52:12,697
If you want more, you can have them, any number.

425
00:52:12,725 --> 00:52:15,610
There are already so many coming to make you
suffer.

426
00:52:15,635 --> 00:52:17,784
There is no need for you to suffer.

427
00:52:17,824 --> 00:52:20,565
Somebody has suffered for you, once and for
all.

428
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:24,469
There is no need for you to suffer anymore.

429
00:52:24,696 --> 00:52:28,635
You are just ready to enter into the Kingdom
of God.

430
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:35,495
If you try to go too much on the left-hand
side or too much on the right-hand side, you

431
00:52:35,495 --> 00:52:38,342
feel that you have gone into a new world.

432
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:39,827
You have not.

433
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:44,195
For example, take a simple thing like LSD.

434
00:52:44,219 --> 00:52:46,510
Now, what happens when you take LSD?

435
00:52:48,482 --> 00:52:50,960
When you take LSD, you move to the right side.

436
00:52:50,984 --> 00:52:52,975
You start seeing the light,

437
00:52:52,976 --> 00:52:55,654
you start seeing the eyes and all that.

438
00:52:55,678 --> 00:52:57,678
Is a movement of the right-hand side.

439
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:03,380
Actually, you put your Ego to the right-hand
side and you start seeing that and once you

440
00:53:03,405 --> 00:53:07,395
see that you do not become anything, you just
see it.

441
00:53:07,395 --> 00:53:10,792
Seeing it is not becoming, you have to become.

442
00:53:10,824 --> 00:53:15,075
And once you start seeing it, you think you
have become a higher personality.

443
00:53:15,075 --> 00:53:16,075
It’s absolutely wrong.

444
00:53:16,075 --> 00:53:21,709
You are under the control of something else.

445
00:53:21,734 --> 00:53:24,534
You are not yourself.

446
00:53:27,469 --> 00:53:35,460
The last word on the collective supraconscious
was Hitler.

447
00:53:35,485 --> 00:53:38,211
He got lost completely.

448
00:53:38,236 --> 00:53:49,899
He was using tantrikas, these horrible people,
and he was using all that knowledge, so called,

449
00:53:49,924 --> 00:53:51,841
how to use these forces.

450
00:53:51,925 --> 00:53:58,915
The forces come to you through dead spirits
who are very powerful in their lifetime, and

451
00:53:58,915 --> 00:54:06,893
those who are not, give up that idea of domination
and they are on this earth still all around.

452
00:54:06,918 --> 00:54:12,255
The left-sided people are the people who indulge
into other kind of things like-alcohols and

453
00:54:12,255 --> 00:54:20,239
ganjas and all these things, by which you
become sort of all the time crying, weeping,

454
00:54:20,264 --> 00:54:21,598
this, that.

455
00:54:21,989 --> 00:54:25,525
In that you see your past.

456
00:54:25,525 --> 00:54:30,255
Is a good idea in a way, but a bad idea also
in a way, because you are in the present,

457
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,489
not in your past.

458
00:54:31,514 --> 00:54:36,097
Past does not exist any more, it’s finished
now.

459
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,797
What exists is the present.

460
00:54:38,822 --> 00:54:44,615
Either you are in the future or in the past
and when you go too much into it you get identified

461
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:47,905
and you think this is what is the Truth, which
is not.

462
00:54:47,905 --> 00:54:51,391
I have to tell you that it is not.

463
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:53,828
What is the Truth is your Spirit.

464
00:54:53,890 --> 00:55:03,842
That it is your evolutionary process has to, little bit
 trigger it and that’s how you become.

465
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,904
By becoming that what happens to you?

466
00:55:05,929 --> 00:55:07,903
You don’t start jumping like mad.

467
00:55:07,928 --> 00:55:08,755
No, it’s not.

468
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,780
Anybody can jump.

469
00:55:09,805 --> 00:55:12,219
Is it difficult to jump?

470
00:55:12,467 --> 00:55:15,297
Some people who said that we went for a flying
course.

471
00:55:15,531 --> 00:55:18,519
They paid 3000 Pounds to fly.

472
00:55:18,544 --> 00:55:19,769
What is the need?

473
00:55:19,794 --> 00:55:23,324
You don’t want to become birds or frogs,
do you?

474
00:55:23,715 --> 00:55:27,265
And they were nothing but frogs jumping.

475
00:55:27,265 --> 00:55:28,895
In my presence they were jumping like that.

476
00:55:28,895 --> 00:55:31,255
I didn’t know how to control.

477
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,677
And they paid 3000 pounds for this.

478
00:55:36,702 --> 00:55:41,225
The other day in a plane I had somebody from
that kind of a thing was sitting and he was

479
00:55:41,225 --> 00:55:43,245
all the time doing like this because I was
sitting behind him.

480
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:46,559
I said, ”I think I better get out from there
and go out the back."

481
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:49,195
You are not in your own control.

482
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:51,095
You have to be your own master.

483
00:55:51,095 --> 00:55:57,209
Now you must know this, that you should be
able to control yourself is the main point.

484
00:55:57,234 --> 00:56:00,795
Like in a car, there are these two powers.

485
00:56:00,795 --> 00:56:07,675
One is the brake and the other is the accelerator.

486
00:56:07,675 --> 00:56:10,905
First, you don’t know how to drive.

487
00:56:10,905 --> 00:56:16,435
You are sitting and first you are going into
a ditch, then sometimes you are getting out

488
00:56:16,435 --> 00:56:20,315
trying to balance it, then you know how to
drive.

489
00:56:20,315 --> 00:56:21,466
When do you know?

490
00:56:21,491 --> 00:56:23,013
When you know.

491
00:56:23,525 --> 00:56:27,685
If you ask me, “Mother, when do we know
how to drive?” When we know.

492
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:29,675
It is an amazingly simple thing.

493
00:56:29,675 --> 00:56:32,175
So, now you have managed both these.

494
00:56:32,175 --> 00:56:36,315
First, you’ve made accident and have done
all mistakes, doesn’t matter.

495
00:56:36,315 --> 00:56:39,795
As long as you learn how to drive, finished.

496
00:56:39,795 --> 00:56:45,993
First you have a driving license, then you
start arranging these two things to keep yourself

497
00:56:46,018 --> 00:56:47,103
into balance.

498
00:56:47,873 --> 00:56:54,735
You come into balance, still you are not the
master of the car, but you are master as far

499
00:56:54,735 --> 00:56:56,735
as the mechanism is concerned.

500
00:56:56,735 --> 00:57:02,244
So, there is a master who is sitting, of the
car and of you.

501
00:57:02,269 --> 00:57:08,457
In the beginning you should be master of your
body, master of everything.

502
00:57:08,543 --> 00:57:13,677
Then, what happens, that you become the master
of the car as well.

503
00:57:13,702 --> 00:57:21,462
First you balance yourself in such a way that
you know how to master your body, your mind

504
00:57:21,487 --> 00:57:22,305
and everything.

505
00:57:22,974 --> 00:57:27,695
And then you become that by which you can
master other people also.

506
00:57:27,785 --> 00:57:29,885
But mastery does not mean domination.

507
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,025
It’s Love.

508
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:35,437
It’s a wrong idea that a master is a person
who dominates.

509
00:57:36,305 --> 00:57:38,485
It comes from where I don’t know.

510
00:57:38,485 --> 00:57:41,255
Master is the one who loves, who really does.

511
00:57:41,255 --> 00:57:46,346
He may just sometimes tell you don’t do
this because it’s wrong, the whole bad things

512
00:57:46,371 --> 00:57:47,979
happening, he may tell you.

513
00:57:48,137 --> 00:57:51,187
But he is a comforter.

514
00:57:51,547 --> 00:57:56,839
Comforter, because you have felt no Love in
your life.

515
00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:00,095
The real Love you have not felt.

516
00:58:00,095 --> 00:58:02,275
You want some place where you can get that
Love.

517
00:58:02,275 --> 00:58:05,565
He is a comforter, is the left side.

518
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:11,225
In our Sahaja Yoga language we call the Comforter
as Mahakali.

519
00:58:11,225 --> 00:58:13,538
She is the Holy Ghost.

520
00:58:13,563 --> 00:58:17,901
From that Comforter other aspects come up.

521
00:58:17,926 --> 00:58:28,355
The second aspect is what you call the Councelor,
The one who tells you what is what, decodes

522
00:58:28,355 --> 00:58:31,655
everything, tells you how to manage, how to
go ahead.

523
00:58:31,655 --> 00:58:35,875
Like an instructor and you verify that.

524
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:44,916
The second one in our Sahaja Yoga is called
Mahasaraswati

525
00:58:44,948 --> 00:58:50,556
And the third one is the Redeemer,the one
who gives you moksha,

526
00:58:51,213 --> 00:58:57,378
through the Sushumna nadi, is called as Mahalaxmi.

527
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:01,808
These are the three powers which exist within
us.

528
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:10,525
The first manifests the left sympathetic,
the second one manifests the right sympathetic

529
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:21,155
and the third one gives you the parasympathetic
which controls these two centers, which coordinates,

530
00:59:21,155 --> 00:59:23,585
cooperates and refills.

531
00:59:23,585 --> 00:59:28,332
But it is still a limited amount of energy.

532
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:32,325
Some people tell me that they went to a person
and felt the energy.

533
00:59:32,325 --> 00:59:34,525
What sort of an energy were you feeling?

534
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:37,605
Very much like shaking and all that.

535
00:59:37,605 --> 00:59:39,325
No, that’s not good.

536
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:43,621
If you are not possessed you should not shake
before a person.

537
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:53,185
On the contrary you start feeling the cool
breeze in the hands.You feel completely relaxed.

538
00:59:53,296 --> 00:59:55,066
How do you know?

539
00:59:55,115 --> 00:59:59,495
What happens through Sahaja Yoga is the way,
is very good.

540
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:01,145
You should see for yourself.

541
01:00:01,145 --> 01:00:12,355
Get three people – one from a lunatic asylum,
certified mad; get another one who is not

542
01:00:12,355 --> 01:00:16,989
realized; get the third one who is realized.

543
01:00:17,136 --> 01:00:18,346
They sit down.

544
01:00:18,371 --> 01:00:23,365
Now you ask them to put their hands towards
you.

545
01:00:23,365 --> 01:00:28,455
Now the person who is lunatic will be doing
like this.

546
01:00:28,455 --> 01:00:35,378
Now if there a cancer patient, he will be
emitting tremendous heat, so much so that

547
01:00:35,403 --> 01:00:39,759
you don’t need a heater, even in London
in December or January.

548
01:00:39,784 --> 01:00:42,994
If there is somebody like that, you
don't need anything.

549
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:51,735
But supposing that person is just a normal,
balanced person, is in the center.

550
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:58,255
He starts feeling the cool breeze and the
realized soul starts feeling the whole thing

551
01:00:58,255 --> 01:00:59,815
coming on.

552
01:00:59,815 --> 01:01:06,746
This is what you have to judge with people
when they come.

553
01:01:06,771 --> 01:01:10,072
You should know what happens to them.

554
01:01:10,097 --> 01:01:18,375
If you are seeking reality, you must know
that you have to face yourself as you are

555
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,375
today.

556
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:27,715
You need not try to hide anything, because
there is nothing to be hidden from your mother.

557
01:01:27,715 --> 01:01:29,185
I don’t care whatever you have done.

558
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,995
I just don’t bother.

559
01:01:30,995 --> 01:01:32,545
It’s not necessary.

560
01:01:32,545 --> 01:01:38,191
The first mantra in Sahaja Yoga to be said
is that Mother, I am not guilty.

561
01:01:38,216 --> 01:01:41,235
You have to say that 16 times in your heart,

562
01:01:41,259 --> 01:01:43,655
that Mother, I´m not guilty

563
01:01:43,977 --> 01:01:54,345
This is the first mantra of Sahaja Yoga, because
in yourself whole things have crawled up into

564
01:01:54,345 --> 01:01:56,494
a diffidence in life.

565
01:01:57,878 --> 01:02:01,085
Even the Ego sometimes gets hurt.

566
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:07,263
When you do mistakes or anything, it gets
hurt and when it gets hurt you get diffident,

567
01:02:07,288 --> 01:02:10,018
so it gets built up within you as diffident.

568
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:15,868
When you say, “Mother, I am not guilty,”
your self-esteem is established.

569
01:02:15,868 --> 01:02:21,645
First day you’d better establish your self-esteem.

570
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:29,012
Within you lies this power of Kundalini.

571
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:33,847
I was very happy to know that people have
reached the conclusion that it is the Kundalini

572
01:02:33,872 --> 01:02:38,014
awakening which is going to do the job.

573
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:40,412
It is a very good conclusion you have reached.

574
01:02:40,437 --> 01:02:46,717
But any Dick, Tom and Harry cannot do it,
one should know that.

575
01:02:48,003 --> 01:02:50,889
Saying it is a sprouting, it’s a living
process.

576
01:02:50,914 --> 01:02:53,730
Now, logically you should approach the subject.

577
01:02:53,755 --> 01:02:56,414
You are all very intelligent people, I can
see that.

578
01:02:56,438 --> 01:02:58,770
You are not stupid people.

579
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:02,560
Living things, like sprouting the seed.

580
01:03:02,585 --> 01:03:06,669
If you want to sprout a seed, can you pull
it out?

581
01:03:07,177 --> 01:03:12,719
Or if you stand on your head, will it happen?

582
01:03:12,744 --> 01:03:15,614
They are such sweet things.

583
01:03:17,268 --> 01:03:18,283
“Hello.

584
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,019
Alright now, sit down for a while."

585
01:03:29,044 --> 01:03:30,308
They are realized souls.

586
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:31,526
They are born realized.

587
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:35,591
So many children are born realized and if
you are not realized [UNCLEAR parents] you

588
01:03:35,591 --> 01:03:39,495
are going to harm them.

589
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:44,984
You have to know what are they.

590
01:03:45,009 --> 01:03:50,818
They know me better than you people do and
they are going to come up.

591
01:03:50,843 --> 01:03:53,373
Wait for ten years before.

592
01:03:53,373 --> 01:04:00,775
They are going to create that great, beautiful
mansion of Love for you.

593
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:07,855
So, this Kundalini is the power within us.

594
01:04:07,949 --> 01:04:10,118
What power is this?

595
01:04:10,143 --> 01:04:22,613
This is the power of Primordial Desire within
us to be one with the Divine, to be united

596
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:25,404
with the Divine and this is the Yoga.

597
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:27,203
All the rest of it is not.

598
01:04:27,203 --> 01:04:31,489
Yoga is nothing, that as you are,

599
01:04:31,513 --> 01:04:36,067
you are to be connected with the
Divine, is the Yoga.

600
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:38,091
All right?

601
01:04:38,226 --> 01:04:41,266
If that is so, this desire is not yet manifested.

602
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:47,153
So, it is called as a sleeping Kundalini and
only the person who has that warmth of the

603
01:04:47,153 --> 01:04:52,673
Mother Earth can do it, as simple as that.

604
01:04:52,673 --> 01:05:03,563
Everyone who thinks that Kundalini is to be
awakened must know it is a spontaneous, living

605
01:05:03,563 --> 01:05:07,290
happening, just like a sprouting of a seed.

606
01:05:07,315 --> 01:05:10,083
You cannot just pull it out.

607
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:13,083
It cannot be done by any effort.

608
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:15,253
It’s spontaneous.

609
01:05:15,253 --> 01:05:21,268
If it is evolutionary, logically we can find
out that we did nothing to become human beings

610
01:05:21,293 --> 01:05:22,399
from amoeba stage.

611
01:05:22,424 --> 01:05:28,923
We didn’t cut our tails to become human
beings, did we?

612
01:05:30,032 --> 01:05:31,992
We didn’t do anything.

613
01:05:32,017 --> 01:05:33,772
It has happened so spontaneously.

614
01:05:33,797 --> 01:05:38,026
But where is the change in us, let’s see
again logically.

615
01:05:38,051 --> 01:05:40,602
Not rationally, but logically.

616
01:05:40,627 --> 01:05:42,431
Rationality could be quite mad.

617
01:05:43,103 --> 01:05:53,043
Logically you should understand, what is the
difference we have got is in our awareness.

618
01:05:53,043 --> 01:05:58,780
Something has to happen in awareness, not
in a way that you just start jumping or taking

619
01:05:58,805 --> 01:06:02,323
out your clothes and doing nonsensical things.

620
01:06:04,818 --> 01:06:05,707
It’s very easy.

621
01:06:05,732 --> 01:06:08,063
In the bathroom everybody does it.

622
01:06:08,063 --> 01:06:10,123
What’s so great?

623
01:06:12,496 --> 01:06:14,566
But just understand.

624
01:06:14,591 --> 01:06:19,472
You can see with your naked eye the pulsation
of the Kundalini.

625
01:06:19,496 --> 01:06:20,674
Not in all.

626
01:06:20,675 --> 01:06:24,193
If you are a first class instrument, it just
happens.

627
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:26,383
Like a jet it goes.

628
01:06:26,383 --> 01:06:30,333
It’s a jet Kundalini in the jet age.

629
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:35,980
It has to happen to all of you.

630
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:42,616
Why some people said you have to do so much
and you have to do like this and you have

631
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:47,633
to do that and you have to cleanse yourself
and then only you’ll get realization.

632
01:06:48,032 --> 01:06:50,702
Why is it so simple today?

633
01:06:51,085 --> 01:06:54,663
The reason is the time has come.

634
01:06:54,663 --> 01:07:02,908
In the beginning of a tree’s life one or
two flowers come in, but now the blossom time

635
01:07:03,025 --> 01:07:09,729
has come, so many seekers I see before me,
just like flowers about to become the fruits.

636
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:12,397
There were never so much seekers before.

637
01:07:12,422 --> 01:07:17,433
Whatever you can say against the modern times
this is the outcome of that.

638
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:21,473
Without this chaos there would have been not
so many.

639
01:07:21,473 --> 01:07:27,293
This is the time that he predicted that many
saints will be born at this time.

640
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,293
[UNCLEAR] imagine thousands of years back
it was written.

641
01:07:29,293 --> 01:07:38,272
When this Kali Yuga, this modern time, the
one who created the Kali, he was caught up

642
01:07:38,297 --> 01:07:43,053
by somebody and he said, “Nala, what do
mean by torturing me and my wife like this.

643
01:07:43,053 --> 01:07:45,293
I am going to kill you.

644
01:07:45,293 --> 01:07:51,662
The Kali said, “Alright, you can kill me,
but you have to find out one thing about me.

645
01:07:52,028 --> 01:07:56,142
You must know what I am and what I represent."

646
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:57,431
“What are you?

647
01:07:57,456 --> 01:07:58,167
Just tell me."

648
01:07:58,167 --> 01:08:02,973
He said: “When the modern times will come,”
we call it as Kali Yuga, “at this time,

649
01:08:02,998 --> 01:08:10,316
these saints who are seeking God in the hills
and dales and in the Himalayas will be born

650
01:08:10,317 --> 01:08:14,479
as ordinary householders and they are going
to receive the blessings.

651
01:08:14,504 --> 01:08:16,193
It’s already promised."

652
01:08:18,368 --> 01:08:23,166
If so, that happening has to take place.

653
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:29,993
But as soon as people came to know that people
are seeking, the market got jammed.

654
01:08:30,018 --> 01:08:32,923
and you got into the trap.

655
01:08:39,467 --> 01:08:45,882
It’s a very subtle method of making money
out of you.

656
01:08:45,907 --> 01:08:53,337
Now, I think, most of them are getting a little
worried, because all their advertising and

657
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:58,165
all that is a little bit fading and they don’t
know how to find out new methods of advertising

658
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:00,891
to get ‘round you.

659
01:09:00,916 --> 01:09:05,046
These people are not interested in Indian
villages.

660
01:09:05,046 --> 01:09:12,576
They are interested in Los Angeles or in Santa
Cruz where they can extract money.

661
01:09:12,577 --> 01:09:16,358
It is an enterprise.

662
01:09:16,383 --> 01:09:19,433
You cannot sell God, can you?

663
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:21,753
You cannot organize it.

664
01:09:21,778 --> 01:09:31,407
Some lady paid $4000 very recently and I heard
somebody told me that she went there, she

665
01:09:31,407 --> 01:09:35,617
danced, she took out her clothes, became mad
and came back.

666
01:09:35,617 --> 01:09:39,493
You pay to go to lunatic asylum or what?

667
01:09:39,518 --> 01:09:43,957
But it helps you to go there because there’s
a fashion on.

668
01:09:43,957 --> 01:09:46,174
Everybody is going, “Oh, I’ve been there
to that Guru."

669
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:48,815
It’s so maddening.

670
01:09:53,769 --> 01:09:58,439
You must understand, you are the new forms
of the old ways.

671
01:09:58,464 --> 01:10:06,617
In olden days, people who could donate for
a church were regarded as very religious.

672
01:10:06,617 --> 01:10:20,227
Even now, I think, some of the Jews, they
have a diamond-jeweled bible and if they can

673
01:10:20,227 --> 01:10:25,685
tithe there they show it nicely that they
have got one.

674
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:32,413
All these false ideas of God you’d better
give up, because you are not followers, you

675
01:10:32,438 --> 01:10:33,600
are seekers.

676
01:10:33,811 --> 01:10:36,306
Let them go on with that nonsense.

677
01:10:36,331 --> 01:10:42,307
But you are seekers, so you take to the Truth
and you become that.

678
01:10:42,307 --> 01:10:45,637
I think today, it’s quite a lot for you.

679
01:10:45,637 --> 01:10:48,004
I would like you to ask me some questions,
but sensible questions and don’t be aggressive

680
01:10:48,029 --> 01:10:49,278
with me.

681
01:10:49,303 --> 01:10:50,371
I am very clever.

682
01:10:50,396 --> 01:10:54,398
As they told him, “She’s a masterpiece
of camouflage."

683
01:10:54,423 --> 01:10:57,309
It’s true, I am, so be careful.

684
01:10:57,334 --> 01:11:00,159
If you have any real questions ask me.

685
01:11:00,184 --> 01:11:06,917
If you are not a true seeker and you are just
trying to show off, you are cheating yourself.

686
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:08,087
Don’t try to show off.

687
01:11:08,087 --> 01:11:09,009
“I read this book."

688
01:11:09,034 --> 01:11:10,235
“I read that book."

689
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,068
“This happened."

690
01:11:11,093 --> 01:11:12,615
”What do you think of this Guru?” Don’t
bring me to controversies.

691
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,595
It’s unnecessary.

692
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:17,664
If they were of any value, you would have
been a realized soul.

693
01:11:17,689 --> 01:11:23,587
I can make out from you who was your Guru
the way they have ruined your Kundalini.

694
01:11:23,587 --> 01:11:26,467
Some of the Kundalinis are so ruined.

695
01:11:26,467 --> 01:11:38,587
I see them just like wounded snakes, tossing
their heads like this.

696
01:11:38,587 --> 01:11:40,317
It is so bleedy.

697
01:11:40,317 --> 01:11:42,788
You don’t know how much they’ve corrupted
you.

698
01:11:42,813 --> 01:11:46,184
Don’t ask me about these cruel people.

699
01:11:46,209 --> 01:11:50,245
If I start blasting them, you’ll be amazed
how they are.

700
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:54,595
I love you very much, but I don’t love them.

701
01:11:54,620 --> 01:12:01,066
I am wrathful, very angry with them, because
they are devils, satanic.

702
01:12:01,091 --> 01:12:04,457
If they wanted money, they could have smuggled.

703
01:12:04,482 --> 01:12:11,629
They could have done something like that,
but they should not have ruined your Kundalini.

704
01:12:11,654 --> 01:12:13,487
They had no business to do it.

705
01:12:13,487 --> 01:12:21,077
They will go to hell, no doubt, but they’ll
be carrying so many with them, they know that.

706
01:12:21,077 --> 01:12:23,377
They are trying to overpower.

707
01:12:23,377 --> 01:12:25,097
They are Anti-Christ.

708
01:12:25,097 --> 01:12:27,026
They think they can win over God.

709
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:35,738
Let them know that God’s Powers are so powerful
that they can all be destroyed like this in

710
01:12:35,763 --> 01:12:36,543
one stroke.

711
01:12:36,568 --> 01:12:42,218
The only thing why they are not destroyed
is because today they are in your brains.

712
01:12:43,047 --> 01:12:50,521
Krishna has said,”Whenever there is the
fall of Dharma, fall of your values, your

713
01:12:50,546 --> 01:13:01,946
virtues, whenever the saints suffer, I come
on this Earth to save the Saints and kill

714
01:13:01,974 --> 01:13:03,737
the devils."

715
01:13:03,737 --> 01:13:07,447
But the devils have gone into the Saints now.

716
01:13:07,447 --> 01:13:09,176
It’s a problem, a dilemma for me.

717
01:13:09,201 --> 01:13:10,277
What to do.

718
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:13,887
These devils have come into your brains.

719
01:13:13,887 --> 01:13:16,407
They are to be taken out, first of all.

720
01:13:16,407 --> 01:13:18,210
Just wait for me to finish.

721
01:13:18,235 --> 01:13:19,854
Do not stick on to one question.

722
01:13:19,879 --> 01:13:22,460
If you stick on, you’ll miss the whole point.

723
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:25,787
By questioning, you will not get Realization.

724
01:13:25,787 --> 01:13:28,457
It’s not a mental activity.

725
01:13:28,457 --> 01:13:31,171
It’s triggering beyond the mental activity.

726
01:13:31,196 --> 01:13:34,640
This lecture is useless if you do not get
your Realization.

727
01:13:34,665 --> 01:13:38,755
In the beginning of the Vedas it was written
that if you do not get the knowledge… Knowledge

728
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,372
doesn’t mean going mad.

729
01:13:40,411 --> 01:13:42,585
It doesn’t mean hypnosis.

730
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:47,557
But if you do not feel the all pervading Power,
then these Vedas are useless.

731
01:13:47,557 --> 01:13:51,952
In the same way my lecture and all mental
activities are useless if you do not get your

732
01:13:51,977 --> 01:13:52,678
Realization.

733
01:13:52,733 --> 01:13:54,974
That’s the main thing you must have.

734
01:13:55,007 --> 01:13:56,046
All right?

735
01:13:56,071 --> 01:13:57,090
May God bless you.

736
01:13:57,115 --> 01:14:05,715
Now, ask me a question.

737
01:14:11,902 --> 01:14:17,992
Seeker: What is the best approach we can take
to go to Laxmi?

738
01:14:18,017 --> 01:14:22,977
Shri Mataji: I will tell you tomorrow about
Laxmi, where she is settled down.

739
01:14:22,977 --> 01:14:26,107
That’s what we are going to do, all the
Goddess, not one.

740
01:14:26,107 --> 01:14:28,147
All in one bundle.

741
01:14:28,147 --> 01:14:29,828
Now what do you say to that?

742
01:14:29,853 --> 01:14:32,899
Alright, good idea.

743
01:14:42,617 --> 01:14:48,925
Seeker: Asks about how to deal with her worries.

744
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:50,448
Alright, doesn’t matter.

745
01:14:50,473 --> 01:14:51,796
We are going to work it out.

746
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:53,648
Don’t worry about your personal things.

747
01:14:53,673 --> 01:15:00,324
It’s all
going to work out en masse.

748
01:15:00,349 --> 01:15:02,349
Don’t worry about your personal things,

749
01:15:02,374 --> 01:15:04,374
just don´t worry.

750
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:05,695
There is nothing to worry

751
01:15:05,735 --> 01:15:07,132
it is going to work out.

752
01:15:07,156 --> 01:15:09,777
Is a working out I must say.

753
01:15:09,801 --> 01:15:11,801
Yes, please.

754
01:15:14,307 --> 01:15:16,507
Dr.

755
01:15:16,507 --> 01:15:21,397
Warren: She is asking whether you said to
say, “Mother, I am not guilty”.

756
01:15:21,397 --> 01:15:24,467
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, please, within yourself.

757
01:15:24,467 --> 01:15:25,467
Very important.

758
01:15:25,467 --> 01:15:26,467
What is it?

759
01:15:26,467 --> 01:15:27,467
Dr.

760
01:15:27,467 --> 01:15:28,467
Warren:She is liking it!

761
01:15:28,467 --> 01:15:30,017
Shri Mataji: Good, good.

762
01:15:30,017 --> 01:15:31,717
May God bless you.

763
01:15:31,717 --> 01:15:33,827
Don’t feel guilty at all.

764
01:15:33,827 --> 01:15:36,117
Otherwise I would not come here.

765
01:15:36,117 --> 01:15:43,337
The ones who have harmed you are guilty.

766
01:15:51,078 --> 01:15:59,440
Seeker: What is your capacity and our capacity
to hate the devils.

767
01:15:59,465 --> 01:16:03,277
Most religions preached that we should not
be angry.

768
01:16:03,277 --> 01:16:08,867
Shri Mataji: You should not be angry, but
with Devils?

769
01:16:08,892 --> 01:16:12,143
You run away from them.

770
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:13,238
Let me handle them.

771
01:16:13,262 --> 01:16:14,496
You don´t worry.

772
01:16:14,521 --> 01:16:16,115
You just don’t worry about them.

773
01:16:16,139 --> 01:16:18,139
All right?

774
01:16:18,153 --> 01:16:19,443
It’s my job.

775
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:36,047
First of all you love yourself, have self-esteem,
know that you are the temple of God, Then

776
01:16:36,047 --> 01:16:40,447
you love by becoming realized, you become
collectively conscious.

777
01:16:40,447 --> 01:16:42,357
Again the word becoming.

778
01:16:42,357 --> 01:16:44,737
Then you start feeling the other within yourself.

779
01:16:44,737 --> 01:16:45,737
Who is the other?

780
01:16:45,737 --> 01:16:48,957
I am not helping you, you are part and parcel
of my being.

781
01:16:48,957 --> 01:16:53,045
If I am helping my finger, am I helping you?

782
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:55,069
Then we see about the rest of the thing.

783
01:16:55,094 --> 01:17:04,766
You don’t worry about them.

784
01:17:19,277 --> 01:17:28,697
Seeker: Many of the people who come to my
clinic have activated their Kundalini too

785
01:17:28,697 --> 01:17:31,347
early and I’m wondering how to help them.

786
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:37,351
Shri Mataji: They do not activate their Kundalini,
they do not.

787
01:17:37,376 --> 01:17:44,612
All these things are just to activate the
sympathetic and it’s very dangerous.

788
01:17:44,637 --> 01:17:49,227
You can get blisters, you can get all kinds
of problems.

789
01:17:49,227 --> 01:17:52,877
You can get cancer also.

790
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:54,767
I get so many people like that.

791
01:17:54,767 --> 01:17:58,057
I’ll make you the masters.

792
01:17:58,057 --> 01:18:00,307
It’s Love.

793
01:18:00,307 --> 01:18:01,467
It cannot harm.

794
01:18:01,467 --> 01:18:03,067
It’s your Mother.

795
01:18:03,067 --> 01:18:07,987
That’s the only Mother you have and you
are the only child.

796
01:18:07,987 --> 01:18:10,297
How can your Kundalini trouble you?

797
01:18:10,297 --> 01:18:13,448
She is just waiting for the moment to give
you realization.

798
01:18:13,473 --> 01:18:23,792
She loves you the most of all.

799
01:18:24,521 --> 01:18:32,700
And you cannot activate it, it just spontaneously
rises.

800
01:18:32,725 --> 01:18:37,347
I was myself amazed to read some books on
Kundalini.

801
01:18:37,372 --> 01:18:39,479
I said these people don’t know what Kundalini
is.

802
01:18:39,504 --> 01:18:40,552
They tell lies

803
01:18:40,553 --> 01:18:41,626
They’re liars.

804
01:18:41,651 --> 01:18:47,566
They are cheats writing such big books about
Kundalini without knowing a word, without

805
01:18:47,591 --> 01:18:48,801
having any authority.

806
01:18:48,826 --> 01:18:50,896
You have to have Divine Authority, isn’t
it?

807
01:18:50,921 --> 01:18:54,591
You cannot get it in a Theological college
or any place you go to.

808
01:18:54,615 --> 01:18:55,414
You can not.

809
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:57,641
Its a Divine Authority you must have.

810
01:19:03,502 --> 01:19:06,852
Seeker: Should we love our enemies as well?

811
01:19:06,877 --> 01:19:08,962
Shri Mataji: First of all you love yourself
and your friends.

812
01:19:08,987 --> 01:19:17,267
Then we can talk of enemies.

813
01:19:17,816 --> 01:19:20,702
You have to know who are your enemies.

814
01:19:20,727 --> 01:19:24,437
Actually, you don’t know who are your enemies.

815
01:19:26,057 --> 01:19:32,357
First, we have to develop that discretion
power.

816
01:19:32,357 --> 01:19:36,387
By your vibrations you will know who is who,
because once you are connected with the mains,

817
01:19:36,387 --> 01:19:38,247
you start feeling it.

818
01:19:38,247 --> 01:19:44,247
You can ask any question whichever is an absolute
question.

819
01:19:44,247 --> 01:19:45,867
You can ask is there God?

820
01:19:45,867 --> 01:19:48,007
You will start feeling a cool breeze coming
in.

821
01:19:48,007 --> 01:19:52,497
Like a computer, you become connected with
the mains and you answer all these questions.

822
01:19:52,497 --> 01:19:59,474
You develop your discretion and you will know
who are yours and who are not yours.

823
01:19:59,499 --> 01:20:06,249
Before that you don’t know, you are so mixed
up.

824
01:20:06,586 --> 01:20:16,646
Actually there are very few enemies that you
have, very few.

825
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:20,020
Should we now have it?

826
01:20:21,247 --> 01:20:26,347
You’ve got that door open there.

827
01:20:26,347 --> 01:20:33,037
Just get one of the doors open for some of
the enemies to fly out.

828
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:36,527
Dr.

829
01:20:36,527 --> 01:20:44,847
Warren: If anyone has their shoes on, take
them off and simply put your hands out towards

830
01:20:44,847 --> 01:20:50,470
Mataji as if asking for it.

831
01:20:50,495 --> 01:20:52,251
Be humble about it.

832
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,521
Be open-minded.

833
01:20:54,546 --> 01:20:56,797
If you’ve got a lot of questions…

834
01:20:56,797 --> 01:20:58,467
Shri Mataji: Sit comfortably.

835
01:20:58,467 --> 01:21:00,887
There is nothing to put yourself to stay.

836
01:21:00,887 --> 01:21:05,697
Your neck should be bending neither forward
nor backward.

837
01:21:05,697 --> 01:21:07,997
There is no effort to be put in.

838
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:08,997
Just sit comfortably.

839
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:11,997
Kundalini will rise by itself and you’ll
get your Realization.

840
01:21:11,997 --> 01:21:14,037
You don’t have to do anything.

841
01:21:14,037 --> 01:21:17,447
Just don’t put your concentration onto one
point.

842
01:21:17,447 --> 01:21:20,237
Some people have a habit of concentrating
here, concentrating there.

843
01:21:20,237 --> 01:21:25,157
All those people who have done this concentration
business or, what is that the another one,

844
01:21:25,157 --> 01:21:28,777
putting the tongue back?

845
01:21:28,777 --> 01:21:32,197
(kechari mudra).

846
01:21:32,197 --> 01:21:40,707
Whatever you have done, all such people should
put their attention here (top of head).

847
01:21:40,707 --> 01:21:42,257
There is the door, not here.

848
01:21:42,257 --> 01:21:43,277
That’s all.

849
01:21:43,277 --> 01:21:52,567
But rest of the people just keep your attention
absolutely loose.

850
01:21:52,567 --> 01:21:55,731
Now, close your eyes.

851
01:21:55,756 --> 01:22:03,852
Keep your eyes closed, because Kundalini has
to pass through Agnya chakra and if your eyes

852
01:22:03,927 --> 01:22:07,533
are not closed, she won’t rise.

853
01:22:07,558 --> 01:22:11,577
Put your hands towards me just like this.

854
01:22:11,577 --> 01:22:17,057
All of you, please put your hands, because
in the hands you have those centers.

855
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:20,327
I would request you to take out if there is
anything heavy in your necks.

856
01:22:20,327 --> 01:22:21,567
Please, take off.

857
01:22:21,567 --> 01:22:22,807
It is better.

858
01:22:22,807 --> 01:22:27,147
Also, if there is anything heavy or tight
on your waist.

859
01:22:27,147 --> 01:22:37,617
You can loosen your belt a little bit.

860
01:22:37,617 --> 01:22:56,167
Just put your hands towards me.

861
01:22:56,167 --> 01:23:05,447
Close your eyes.

862
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:30,727
Please, put your right hand on your heart,
because Spirit resides in our heart.

863
01:23:30,827 --> 01:23:35,407
Sit very comfortably without any strain on
your back.

864
01:23:35,407 --> 01:23:36,887
That is very important.
