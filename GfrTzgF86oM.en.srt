1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:16,400
I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis, and all the
seekers of truth, may God bless you all. Is

2
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:27,660
such a great thing to be back home with all
of you and to see you here blooming with joy

3
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:37,140
and happiness. That's the fate of a Mother
who has so many children, that she goes from

4
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:43,250
places to places leaving some children behind
but looking forward to meeting others. Somehow

5
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,400
that compensates for the separation.

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Today I think we should start on a very subtler
ideas about Sahaja Yoga, because you people

7
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:04,280
have understood it on the other plane of mechanism
that works it out, the Kundalini, the chakras

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:11,030
and all those things. But we have to see what
is the problem that faces actually human beings

9
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:18,030
and why we make such mistakes in our seeking.
Is a very important thing to understand, because

10
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,280
unless and until we understand why we really
make mistakes or others make mistakes we can

11
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,280
never forgive them, and we might have a kind
of a high handed attitude towards others who

12
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,920
are now coming to Sahaja Yoga, thinking that,
why did they do like that, and why did they

13
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,920
commit this mistake and they could have done
better. But I personally think that if you

14
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,770
look at yourself you will know that you also
committed mistakes. Everybody has committed

15
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,690
mistakes. Some have committed more mistakes,
and some have committed less. But what is

16
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:04,690
the reason why human being has been committing
mistake? That's what we should look into it.

17
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,770
The first and foremost thing is without getting
-

18
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:14,770
(Shri Mataji speaks aside: Come along here
you can sit there is a lot of space here,

19
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:22,269
come along. Move out, move out you can sit
in the center, come along, come along, come

20
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:26,749
along not to feel shy there's lot of space
in here. I think you'll have to have a bigger

21
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:33,749
hall now Matha? Yes come along, come there's
room here you can sit down here, come along.

22
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:44,409
So sweet of you. Thank you very much, so very
kind of you thank you, thank you. Please make

23
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,840
yourself comfortable come along. So how are
you? Congratulations and God Bless. Are you

24
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,290
all right there all of you?)

25
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:06,290
Now those who have got Realization and those
who have felt the cool breeze and have matured

26
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,400
in Sahaja Yoga know that automatically you
drop out many things, automatically. Now why

27
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,359
do we do it, you see, why do we drop things?
Even I don't ask you for it, you just drop

28
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:29,359
them, why? The reason is the light of the
Spirit within ourselves empowers us to see

29
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:38,430
that this is wrong. Like as we have got eyes,
once we have eyes we know whether we are going

30
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:47,099
to fall here, or we are going to slip, or
what's going to happen. In the same way, when

31
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,749
you get this vibratory awareness it is not
an awareness only of the fingers, is the awareness

32
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:59,749
of the whole being and you just drop out everything
that is against your Spirit. I don't have

33
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:06,889
to tell you. But without Self-Realization
what happens that reality is just a myth.

34
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:17,209
It's only a mental projection with which you
live. You project your mind and you think

35
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:23,110
this is reality. You can call anything as
reality. Any hallucination can be a reality,

36
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:29,800
any theory can be a reality, any absurd ideas
could be a reality. I mean all religions have

37
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,800
taken that form now, it's very sad. But all
religions, which came from truth and from

38
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:44,379
reality, are nothing but mental projections,
and they're very far away from reality. You

39
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:51,419
can only feel, understand and assimilate reality
if you are a self-realized person. Unless

40
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:58,610
and until this Self has expressed itself or
manifested within yourself, the light has

41
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:05,210
come into you, how are you to manage? Whatever
you try is a mental projection. Like many

42
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,970
people who came first, "Oh, we believe that
we are born again." All right, now how can

43
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:15,520
you challenge it, if you believe into something?
"I believe" is the one of the great sentences

44
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,210
we use. But what is that I that believes?
That's that ego. That's not your Self, because

45
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:28,330
you have not yet felt the Self. So to feel
the Self is the most important thing if you

46
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:34,590
have to know the reality. So you must excuse
all others who have not felt the Self, who

47
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,680
have their own mental projections. They might
look like fanatic; they might look like stupid

48
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,610
people. They may look like to be very high
handed or maybe you might think they are these

49
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,889
ego orientated pseudo-intellectuals and all
sorts of things. But all that is mythical

50
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:58,889
because that plane on which they move is mythical
itself. Whatever you know through your mental

51
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,159
projection is imagination itself.

52
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:10,159
But Spirit is the reality, and to know the
reality you have to be the Spirit. And once

53
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:17,729
the Spirit starts shining within you, you
just drop everything like hot brick. Like

54
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,650
I would say, as I've many times told you,
that in our human awareness we know what is

55
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:30,919
beauty is, we know what cleanliness is. For
a dog he doesn't understand cleanliness. If

56
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:37,919
you don't give him a bath he'll be quite happy,
actually to give him a bath is a problem.

57
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,879
But to a human being, you see, what is a sin
or what is wrong? Sin is nothing but whatever

58
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:51,879
is against the Spirit, is sin. Even fear is
a sin. Any such small little sins or the big

59
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:06,199
sins, all are nothing, but they are all against
the Spirit. But if you have not felt the Spirit

60
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:13,990
whatever you do will amount to something like
anti-Spirit, because you don't know what you

61
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,909
are doing. Now the prophets have tried their
level best to tell you that you must keep

62
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:26,909
your balance, you have to follow a certain
religion as they call it, or as we call it

63
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:35,759
dharma within yourself. But that to for what?
Why to have the balance within you? People

64
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:42,310
will always say, "What's wrong?" "What's wrong
if we are not in balance, what's there? What's

65
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,659
wrong in drinking?" I never said don't drink
before Realization. After Realization you

66
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:52,110
yourself drop out. But they say, "What's wrong,
why does he tell us like this? Why should

67
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:59,110
we listen to them?" Why the balance? The balance
is needed for the ascent. Unless and until

68
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:07,520
you have a balance how will you ascend? Imagine
an aeroplane without any balance. Say a wing

69
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,779
is missing, will it be able to take off from
the ground, cannot. So for the ascent it is

70
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:18,939
necessary to have the necessary balance. So
they said, "Keep in the balance."

71
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:25,939
But even when we're just told simple thing
to keep to the central path, to lead a life

72
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:34,550
of balancing yourself or moderation in your
life, in that also the moderation part of

73
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:44,820
it they have made it an extreme. Everything
has been made into an extreme, because religion

74
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,340
also they want to follow through their mental
conception. That's why you find all these

75
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:57,260
religions is a mess. But I would not blame
them for that because they had no other instrument

76
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:02,750
to go ahead, and they wanted to go ahead.
They had no other way to proceed further so

77
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,270
they used only one engine they had was this
mental projection. And they made all these

78
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:14,270
various projections and that's how they are
so diversified and separated from each other.

79
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:22,130
But as soon as your Spirit shines, then, everything
drops out by itself because it is beyond mind.

80
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:32,980
Spirit is beyond mind, I don't have to tell
you anything that you must have balance, you

81
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,830
develop a balance. If you don't have a balance
you'll just get vibrations in one hand, other

82
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:43,980
hand will be just cold or will be hot, so
you start giving your balance. But I don't

83
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,710
say that give a balance means following a
particular religion or anything because if

84
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:56,710
I say that half of you may run away. The beauty
of Self-Realization lies in secretly working

85
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:08,880
out within you, everything that is virtuous,
that is beautiful, that is joyful, secretly,

86
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,510
it doesn't tell you. For example now supposing
somebody has an imbalance on the right hand

87
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:27,510
side. Very intellectual fellow, and thinking
for the future and futuristic man you see,

88
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,240
forgetting all his past. Even there are people
I've known they have forgotten their names,

89
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:40,240
and the names of their wives. But they are
so futuristic. For such a person if you tell

90
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,080
them don't think about the future, he can't
do it because he's put his attention like

91
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:51,030
this. The whole ego portion has gone that
side and he's all looking forward to the future.

92
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:58,030
But if you put him somehow or other, in a
state where his Self-Realization takes place

93
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,950
then immediately he will say, "Mother, my
right hand is burning and there's nothing

94
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,090
in the left hand."

95
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:13,090
So you start talking on a very mundane way,
not in a very subtle manner like all the philosophers

96
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,120
talk. All right that means your right is not
getting proper vibrations, so you raise your

97
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:26,540
left to the right? Now for an intellectual
he can't understand, "What is this raising

98
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,350
left to the right. I have read Bhagavad-Gita,
I have read Bible, I've done Koran, I have

99
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,890
done this, nowhere written left to the right.
What do you mean by this kind of a nonsense,

100
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:37,470
you see that you have to put your hand just
left to the right and you get the balance?"

101
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:44,470
I cannot appeal to a mind which has been thinking
about God, religion, everything, all right.

102
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:52,830
So the secretive working of the Kundalini
is such, that She goes in that portion where

103
00:11:53,190 --> 00:12:00,190
you need help. She works it out and She raises
you and gradually She transforms you.

104
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:09,290
But if it is not awakened, if it has not yet
touched the Sahasrara, means if it has not

105
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:17,830
touched the feet of your Spirit, it may not
be interested, it may not be interested. So

106
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:25,730
the first and foremost thing is to raise the
Kundalini, and to let Her at least once know

107
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:35,110
that She has touched the Spirit. Then She
has interest, otherwise She hasn't got any

108
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,860
interest. That's why you must have seen some
people who come to Sahaja Yoga and just drop

109
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:46,370
out. The reason is the Kundalini Itself is
not interested. So the foremost duty of every

110
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:53,370
Sahaja Yogi is, first of all, not to be angry
or annoyed with people who have done lots

111
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,660
of wrong. But be very kind to them and gentle
because they are just seekers of truth. How

112
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:06,570
can you be angry with them? Already we have
lost so many of them because of their stupidity.

113
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:11,010
But we must try to salvage as many as possible.

114
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:18,010
And then the second duty of every Sahaja Yogi
is to slowly steadily to convince the person

115
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,540
that he should become the Spirit. Of course
you'll meet so many who will be self-appointed

116
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,450
people they'll say, "Oh, I've already met
the Spirit, I am the Spirit. I'm Christ."

117
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:33,450
They can say anything, so soothe them down
a little, bring them down and raise their

118
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,940
Kundalini, but don't leave it half way, must
touch the Sahasrara. I have seen some of the

119
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,560
Sahaja Yogis, even in India I've seen, they
just give up. They'll sit down, "Oh Mother

120
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,600
forget it, we don't want to do it, it's like
a mountain we can't raise it." But we have

121
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,810
to work, that's what we have to do is to work
it out. Raise the Kundalini, pierce through

122
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,520
the Sahasrara, and then Kundalini will work
it out.

123
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,230
It was a question asked to Me, "Mother that
we gave Realization to so many people, out

124
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:12,230
of that only about thirty percent people are
coming up the rest are lost." The reason is

125
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:19,230
you have left it half done. So this is one
of the reasons why we have lost some people

126
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:28,770
and there is no connection still established.
Now those people who come to Sahaja Yoga you

127
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:34,260
have to really work hard on them. Instead
of arguing with them, because what will you

128
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,220
argue is all mental projection. On what point
are you going to argue with them because that

129
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,870
is not going to give them the light of the
Spirit. So somehow or other work it out in

130
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:50,870
such a way that they feel light of the Spirit,
then talk. But we think that if we talk to

131
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:57,910
them it will help. It's not question of conviction,
is the question of happening, is question

132
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,480
of becoming, which is important. Unless and
until they become, what is the use of argument,

133
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:11,850
there's no law court here. There is no debate
going on, there is no election. There's nothing

134
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:18,850
of the kind, it is something that has to happen
to all those people that they should get their

135
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:25,850
light of their Spirit. And once they get it,
then it is very much easier for you to talk

136
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,380
to them and tell them about it.

137
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:34,380
The 
philosophy of Sahaja Yoga is extremely simple.
Is the simplest of all philosophy you can

138
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:44,610
think of. Is a very simple philosophy, is
that, once you get your Realization you start

139
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:54,220
feeling for the first time, the All Pervading
Power and forget everything else. Once you

140
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:00,300
get that feeling of the All Pervading Power
only you have know how to maneuver it, how

141
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:07,300
to work it out and how to use it for your
own growth. It is made easy, it has to be

142
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:16,610
as it is the most vital force that has to
take place in the realm of spirituality.

143
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:23,610
Now thank God, many gurus are exposed. Thank
God many myths that were working out are being

144
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:29,090
now blasted. When I was telling you people
about the promiscuousness and all those things,

145
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:34,290
that this will never lead you to God but to
hell, I remember when people criticized Me

146
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:40,320
to be Victorian. I mean people have ideas,
which is a very Victorian ideas, and also

147
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,750
saying that Mother is very matronly and all
sorts of English language you see, that they

148
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:51,490
could use about Me. But now you see, what
have recently I've told, thank God there have

149
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:58,490
been a film showing the diseases we get by
promiscuous life. The right sane attitude

150
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,270
towards life definitely helps you very much.
But thank God, the grace of God is so great

151
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:14,270
that once you get Realization you become such
a different person that everything drops out.

152
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,949
You are really a transformed personality and
so that one should know whatever was the past

153
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:27,069
is finished now, is no more there. The egg
is finished, is the bird. And whom to blame,

154
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:34,069
whom to talk about is the bird there, now
let the bird find its own wings and fly. Once

155
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,880
you understand this simple thing of Sahaja
Yoga is that we have to make every one feel

156
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:48,690
the All Pervading Power of God, to begin with.
Unless and until they have felt it we have

157
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,430
not to accept them as realized souls. They
have to feel it.

158
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,960
Now of course as you know if the Vishuddhi
chakra is not all right they may not feel

159
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,660
it in the hands. But still no use if you tell
them that according to us you are a realized

160
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:09,380
soul but according to you, you are not feeling.
You see because the mind is working. Instead

161
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:15,520
of feeling a little disturbed about it, upset
about it, they may just think that, you see,

162
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,520
it's just a make believe or a psychological
stuff and I didn't feel it, I'm a person of

163
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:27,520
great will power, that attitude, yes, many
feel like that. So they can be lost. For now

164
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:37,600
as our Sahaja Yoga is increasing everywhere
in the world, we have so many good Sahaja

165
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Yogis in England now. They are sensible people
and uniquely placed in this great country.

166
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,600
And they have to understand that wisdom is
higher than intellect, and discretion is higher

167
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:09,190
than debating. Take a very kindly and a compassionate
attitude towards the rest of the people, and

168
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:16,860
then work it out that they should somehow
or other, feel this subtle force of God's

169
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:26,190
love. Then gradually try to bring them round
and teach them what you've got. Is easy to

170
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:33,790
blame their ego, it's very easy, to say, "Oh,
they're ego orientated, throw them away,"

171
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:40,140
very easy to say that. But that's not their
mistake. That's not their doing. It was because

172
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,920
they never felt the Spirit before. Whatever
they have they have used that instrument whether

173
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:52,920
ego or super ego and they have built up their
own self, in that kind of a fort. But this

174
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:01,080
barrier can be broken very easily as soon
as they get their Realization.

175
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:08,580
I found the same thing in Australia. When
I went there so many came back, so many. And

176
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:14,960
now we have everywhere quite a lot of people.
In every ashram now we have coming at least

177
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,550
thousand to two thousand people. We have five
centers now and it's working out very well.

178
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:27,260
Same thing is in England, we can work it out.
But I told them the same thing that reality

179
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:32,920
is a different thing, and a mental projection
is a different thing. You still do not talk

180
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,730
on that level to these people. Because you
just increase their mental projection and

181
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,660
their barriers within them and this has helped
them a lot. And you'll be amazed that those

182
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:48,360
people who were lost have come back to Sahaja
Yoga and are growing very fast within themselves.

183
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:55,360
Now for the new people I have to tell, you
have to have patience with yourself. You have

184
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:03,010
to have patience. As I have patience for you,
I have love for you, I am here only because

185
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:10,010
of you. You also must have patience for yourself
and full confidence in yourself that you'll

186
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:17,050
become the Spirit. If you have these two things,
I'm sure it will work out. It is going to

187
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:24,720
work out. Once you get your Realization you
have to work out on other people, and gradually

188
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,720
you will be amazed that it will grow, and
it will convince you, and you will know that

189
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:40,900
you have become the realized soul. But the
realized souls are very simple people. If

190
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,290
they say, "I am a realized soul," nobody can
believe them because there are no horns around

191
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:56,290
them. No gurudom around them, nothing of the
kind, they're extremely simple people. So

192
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:04,610
what is going to help you is a simple attitude
toward yourself and toward these Sahaja Yogis,

193
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:12,490
and towards Sahaja Yoga that you have come
here to become the Spirit. We have to gain

194
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:18,950
nothing from you. There's no clientele as
such, there's no money proposition, nothing.

195
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:25,670
It is you who have come to the Ganges, to
take the holy water, it is you who has to

196
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:32,670
take it. We are here to help you. If that
attitude is developed I'm sure, with your

197
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:41,730
co-operation, we can change the face of this
world. And as William Blake has said in this

198
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:50,030
Hampstead, "We have to build up Jerusalem
here."

199
00:22:53,800 --> 00:23:00,800
May God Bless you all.

200
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:12,210
Any questions you have you ask?

201
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:20,090
(Shri Mataji speaks aside: This is not a loud
speaker. I think I better present you with

202
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:49,330
a loud speaker. What happened, you presented
one to India why don't you get one. Further

203
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:11,790
conversation about the speaker)

204
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Any questions to request Me?

205
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:33,410
Seeker asks a question: - How can one who
is new this subject distinguish between what

206
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:59,270
is psychic phenomena and what is actually
the manifestation of the Spirit itself? [Seeker

207
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:28,550
gives a long introduction to this question
which is unclear.]

208
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:35,740
Shri Mataji: is good idea. May God bless you.

209
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:42,740
You see when they say they have felt the cool
breeze the psychic people they are telling

210
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:52,470
lies, simple as that. Because the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost, that you feel, has not

211
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:07,559
only the cool breeze it has its own powers.
For example, now I say there is a flame here,

212
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:22,380
all right. Now if there is a blind man also
if he puts his finger round there he will

213
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:35,650
know it's a flame isn't it, because he can
feel the heat. In the same way this cool breeze

214
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:55,140
is just to feel this cool breeze but is a
dynamic stuff. You can, when you get this

215
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:07,970
cool breeze established within yourself, you'll
be amazed that under your hand the Kundalini

216
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:21,130
will pulsate, it will rise, and you will feel
the cool breeze of another person. With this

217
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:31,780
cool breeze you can cure diseases like cancer
and many other. With this cool breeze you

218
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,220
can give balances to people. Everything you
can do with this cool breeze, is tremendous.

219
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:46,220
If you have any, say question, any question,
supposing you are a realized soul, you want

220
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:55,770
to know about a guru if he is real or not.
If it's a psychic thing you won't get anything.

221
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:04,549
You won't know why psychic people are all
going to parapsychology, is all wrong, it's

222
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:11,620
a horrible stuff. This parapsychology is one
of the worst things that can happen to a human

223
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:20,710
being, but they don't know what it is. There's
nothing absolute about it. But the cool breeze

224
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:30,200
is the one that gives you complete absolute
idea. Like you want to know is there God?

225
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:37,940
Ask a simple question like that, "Mother is
there God?" You'll get a cool breeze. Now

226
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:45,280
it's so, discrimination is so great and so
precise that supposing you want to know about

227
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:52,309
a guru how he is, supposing he's a devil then
you might get even blisters on your hand.

228
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:52,840
You might even get tremendous heat in your
hand and vibrations will stop completely.

229
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,840
But supposing he's half way then you may not
get such bad effects but there won't be any

230
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,940
breeze at all.

231
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:04,940
But supposing he's a realized soul, for William
Blake for example, I don't have to ask I know,

232
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:12,320
but unless and until you really feel that
cool breeze in your hand in a real way, also

233
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:22,340
it's coming out of your head then you should
not believe that you have got a Realization,

234
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:34,179
you should not believe into it. Now they are
many psychic cases I know who told Me, "We

235
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:47,110
have always felt the cool breeze," because
they cannot accept it, just say, and their

236
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,630
Kundalini just frozen there. Nothing of the
kind, I'm getting terrible heat and just praying

237
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:02,630
if this person goes away for a while will
be good rest for Me. And he says, "No, no

238
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:12,799
but I have felt the cool breeze." All the
time he's telling Me lies. "I have always

239
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:21,940
felt the cool breeze everywhere." But the
Kundalini is down below you can feel it yourself,

240
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
you can see for yourself. If the Kundalini
is not here how are you feeling the cool breeze?

241
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,200
You cannot. Is a phenomena as a result of
something it's not just a phenomena of the

242
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:54,630
cool breeze. But when the Kundalini rises
above the Sahasrara then only you can feel

243
00:30:54,630 --> 00:31:01,630
the cool breeze. I've seen many people like
that. They don't want to accept, oh that I've

244
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,160
got all this.

245
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:19,160
But supposing there are people who are born
realized. There are people, some people who

246
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:26,160
feel the cool breeze. Now you have to differentiate
between them and the unreal people. There

247
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,530
can be some people who are born realized.
But nowadays we have decided not to tell them

248
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:37,530
that they are born realized because, those
who came to us we told them they're born realized,

249
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:58,740
their ego suddenly inflated like this. You
see absolutely gone cases and we lost them.

250
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:11,429
Because you see, if you are a born realized
it's nothing great, nothing great, because

251
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:25,799
so many are realized. Supposing you get Realization
today all right, so you'll be a realized soul,

252
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:41,020
but you're not a Sahaja Yogi. Sahaja Yogi
is a person who not only is a realized soul

253
00:32:53,730 --> 00:33:00,730
but he knows all the technique of this pure
knowledge. He knows all the laws of the Divine

254
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:16,750
happening and also he knows how to handle
the Kundalini. Sahaja Yogi is a knowledgeable

255
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:26,230
person the one who knows all about it. Who
knows all the permutations and combinations,

256
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:33,230
who knows how to maneuver it and everything
about it. So he's you can say a boy who enters

257
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:49,809
into the first class. He just knows one plus
one is two. But say a professor of mathematics,

258
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:18,700
there's a big difference between the two.
So even if somebody's a born realized it's

259
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:29,849
better not to tell him that you are born realized
because he suddenly thinks he has become a

260
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:37,329
professor. Imagine a little boy thinking that
he's become a professor. It is very detrimental

261
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:44,329
to him as well as to others. So best thing
is to get the cool breeze in the right sense,

262
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:49,179
in the right way and understand that it works,
it must work. As you see how do you make out

263
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:56,179
a real note and an unreal note? The real note
it works. So it's not a myth it's a reality,

264
00:34:57,499 --> 00:35:04,499
again I say it's a reality. Supposing this
is an artificial thing it won't work. Anything

265
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:13,019
that is artificial doesn't work, all right?
You go to this Madame Tussaud's place and

266
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:20,239
you'll find so many people sitting looking
exactly like us you see, but they are not

267
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:27,239
living, all right, you understand My point?
So you have to master it, know it fully. You

268
00:35:29,729 --> 00:35:36,729
have to master it and understand it. You see
unless and until you understand it to that

269
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:45,700
extent, you cannot reach any conclusion, all
right, and we have to work it out. May God

270
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:51,489
Bless you.

271
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:58,489
Is not only thing that is cool breeze, where
is your Kundalini, whether it has risen or

272
00:36:02,249 --> 00:36:09,249
not, if the cool breeze is coming out of the
head. Only a Sahaja Yogi can say, nobody can

273
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,059
say that. I've seen many people who get even
the cool breeze coming out of their head they

274
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:38,059
cannot feel it because their hands are not
sensitive. Only a Sahaja Yogi can say, is

275
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:52,519
true. But that doesn't mean that a Sahaja
Yogi is something out of the blue, is just

276
00:37:05,569 --> 00:37:12,569
like you. Only thing is he has grown into
a new awareness, which you are going to grow

277
00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:35,339
yourself.

278
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:40,999
(UNCLEAR- Mother speaks to seeker)

279
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:47,999
In Sahaja Yoga there are so many ways and
methods how we work out all the help from

280
00:37:55,210 --> 00:38:01,849
all the elements, how we work it. For example,
this gentleman say for example, I find his

281
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:08,849
left side is overloaded. You can ask the Mother
Earth to take away the problem. Just put left

282
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:21,529
hand towards Me and right hand on the Mother
Earth, you can get cured, you will feel better.

283
00:38:21,529 --> 00:38:24,200
Feeling better now? Just wait, have patience.
It will work.

284
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,979
Any other question?

285
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:29,940
You must see that the person is transformed.
They may say anything the person must be transformed.

286
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:36,940
He must become a saint. And the saint is not
a person who calls himself a saint, but a

287
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:41,420
saintly person is that one who drops out all
nonsensical things, automatically. Nothing

288
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,430
sticks to it. As they say, "The lotus leaf
you see, if you put water on the lotus leaf

289
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:50,910
the water drops out, nothing sticks to it."
I think in England at least seventy percent

290
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:54,670
or maybe say sixty percent people have been
drug addicts, Sahaja Yogis, you can't believe

291
00:38:54,670 --> 00:39:01,670
they were. If not addicts they were something
like that. I used to call them drugists and

292
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,339
chemists, but they're different today.

293
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:03,910
Any other question please?

294
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:10,910
(Question- Is the artificial raising of the
Kundalini dangerous?)

295
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:18,640
Yes first. You see the trouble is, those who
have written about it have no authority. I

296
00:39:23,499 --> 00:39:28,190
have said about it many a times. Like say
a villager comes to the city and puts his

297
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:35,190
hand in the plug you see, and gets a shock
and says electricity is very dangerous, all

298
00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:51,869
right, is like that. But Kundalini is your
Mother. You have only one Mother and She has

299
00:39:54,589 --> 00:40:01,200
only one son. It's your individual Mother.
You don't share it even with your brother

300
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:07,430
or sister. She's your Mother. She doesn't
trouble you at all. She's your the greatest

301
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:14,430
well wisher who's born again and again with
you waiting for this time, there's no question.

302
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:22,469
But those who are unauthorized harm the Kundalinis
of thousands of people. People have seen that.

303
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:29,460
Because you see that's My nature perhaps that
I can do it. But then people feel very hurt

304
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:36,460
you know they can't understand why should
Mother do it. I said, "You better do it. It's

305
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:47,890
good I should retire, I'm sixty years of age
is better for Me to retire, you should do

306
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:03,680
it." But if you are doing so many things,
you know I don't know how to drive, I don't

307
00:41:08,989 --> 00:41:15,989
know many things that you do. I know one thing,
how to raise Kundalini. So if something is

308
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:34,190
difficult and is done easily means that person
is a master of that. And if that person is

309
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:45,210
a master doesn't matter there are masters
of everything, all right. So far I haven't

310
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:52,210
seen anybody suffering because of Kundalini
and should not. But it's not an easy thing

311
00:41:53,940 --> 00:42:00,940
for many people because I met some saints
this time and they said, "It's only You who

312
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:08,289
can do it Mother we can't." There's a fellow
called Gaugan (Not sure of the name - SG)

313
00:42:10,749 --> 00:42:17,749
Maharaja, a very old man and he lives in a
forest on top of a hill and he's come to Me

314
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:42,190
also. And he has many disciples and one of
them he told him to do this and do that you

315
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:56,119
see, the balancing part of it, and he did
all those things for fourteen years. And suddenly

316
00:42:57,029 --> 00:43:04,029
in a program in Kolhapur he just came to see
Me, and got his Realization. He was shocked

317
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:12,729
that, "Fourteen years I've been doing all
this and I never got it and how is it in a

318
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:24,809
short time I got it?" So he went to see Gaugan
Maharaja so he told him about Me. He said,

319
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:39,420
"She's different." So that's how it is, and
I feel rather embarrassed to talk about it,

320
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:51,630
all right? May God Bless you.

321
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:58,630
(Question by seeker: -: How do you relate
Your experiences or what You are talking to

322
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,869
us about with traditional yogic practices?)

323
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:13,869
Very much so. Very much, it is the most traditional
thing, you see. Because the yogic practices

324
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:25,460
you do here is some sort of a, I don't know
what to call it, but it's like just a wee

325
00:44:30,289 --> 00:44:37,289
bit of it you've have taken are doing that,
that's not yogic practice at all. You see

326
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:51,400
Patanjali Yoga, which was practiced thousands
of years back, when people led a different

327
00:44:54,109 --> 00:45:01,109
type of life. When the children went to school
with the gurus, who was a realized soul. Nobody

328
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:11,599
who was not a realized soul was called a guru.
And the children had to lead a very celibate

329
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:29,700
life because according to your university,
you see, you're called as your gotras. And

330
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:39,559
you could not believe it today, say my gotra
is Shandilya. Shandilya was the muni of My

331
00:45:47,249 --> 00:45:54,249
family. I can't marry a man from the same
gotra even today. Thousands of years have

332
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:12,430
passed since then, Shandilya lived about forty,
fifty thousand years back, but even today

333
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:29,650
I can't marry a man who belongs to 
the same gotra. So the celibacy you can imagine,
that from one university you could not marry.

334
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:57,219
That's how they lived a life and then they
went, after five years of age, they went to

335
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:05,950
those schools, they lived there and they came
out of that in complete celibate living they

336
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:14,200
were. And then they got married and then when
they had children they sent them back, like

337
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:26,089
that the system was. But if you read Patanjali
Yoga the first thing that Patanjali Yoga said

338
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:40,999
that, "Ishwara Pranitana (MAYBE Prathistana
- SG)," means the establishment of God. First

339
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:47,999
you must establish the Spirit. It's like we
have not yet started the car for example,

340
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:55,999
all right, it's very logical. Now I'm coming
to Hampstead, I don't know the way, supposing,

341
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:10,130
and I don't know which way to go. Now supposing
I say that all right now I have to go to Hampstead,

342
00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:25,569
from the very beginning I'll turn to the left
and not to the right, can I do it, no? So

343
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:41,009
when the Kundalini rises then only you will
know which chakra is catching what is your

344
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:55,019
problem.

345
00:48:55,019 --> 00:49:02,019
Beforehand supposing you are doing any, at
random, any exercises. Say example, the way

346
00:49:08,499 --> 00:49:15,499
people are doing these days yoga, so called,
it has nothing to do with yoga. You see these

347
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:28,839
exercises when you do, you are not aware as
to what are your problems. You don't know

348
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:40,809
what you are suffering from and what particular
asana is needed for a particular type of a

349
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:53,690
chakra, which is blocked, all right. So what
you're doing is indiscriminate, taking medicines

350
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,880
without understanding. But the practice of
these things are a very minimum part of the

351
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,459
whole of Patanjali. First is Ishwara Pranitana
(MAYBE Prathistana - SG) means when you establish

352
00:50:12,459 --> 00:50:19,459
the Spirit. Ishwara Pranitana (MAYBE Prathistana
- SG) means the establishment of the God.

353
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:26,859
Once you have established that, then the Kundalini
starts moving and then you know where to stop,

354
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:35,450
where to turn, how to do. This is real tradition,
but the last fifty years, you see, all sorts

355
00:50:41,979 --> 00:50:48,979
of nonsensical people have come up. They've
changed this, changed that and is logical,

356
00:50:54,450 --> 00:51:01,450
is logical you see. Supposing you are suffering
from Agnya chakra all right, and you are doing

357
00:51:01,789 --> 00:51:08,789
the exercise of this chakra you will spoil
this as well as spoil this. There's no logic,

358
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:15,779
there's no understanding, nothing. You see
this is just physical exercises because people

359
00:51:15,779 --> 00:51:18,910
want to become actors and actresses I think.

360
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:25,700
(Seeker speaks to Mother. Mentions the eight
limbs of yoga the whole astanga going through

361
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:31,219
the nearma and the asanas, prameara, pratchara
to try to work toward samadhi)

362
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:38,219
All those things you see, no, no it does not,
it does not, it does not. That's the other

363
00:51:40,609 --> 00:51:47,609
way round you see, this is the problem. You
see what happens that, unless and until you

364
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:54,769
get your Realization you have no entry into
yourself you don't know where you are going.

365
00:51:54,769 --> 00:52:01,769
This will never work out. On the contrary,
all those who have done Hatha Yoga catch on

366
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:09,599
their heart center very much, because the
whole attention is on the body. Because the

367
00:52:11,489 --> 00:52:18,489
attention is on the body the left heart catches.
Just now I have been to one organization where

368
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:24,319
I met three of them.

369
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:31,319
They all had their left side absolutely frozen,
so they said, "Mother what should we do?"

370
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:41,690
I said, "You must sing the praise of God.
Forget, you have become so dry like a bamboo

371
00:52:41,749 --> 00:52:48,749
now, fill it up with the love of God." Forget
it all your asanas and everything, just like,

372
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:54,289
you see, dried fishes. There's no emotions
left. It's such an imbalance, ha and tha both

373
00:52:54,289 --> 00:53:01,289
the things, they've not said only ha, ha is
the surya nadi they said ha and tha. What

374
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:13,249
are you doing about tha, nothing? So you are
doing ha yoga, all right. You have to do Hatha

375
00:53:25,749 --> 00:53:32,749
Yoga but, without Ishwara Pranitana (MAYBE
Prathistana - SG), without Realization we

376
00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:40,549
also do, not that we don't do, whatever is
needed that we do. For example, now when I

377
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:54,039
went there I told them what should be given
to a person who is suffering from mental diseases.

378
00:53:54,039 --> 00:54:01,039
He said, "All this for mental diseases, also
all these for egoistical people, also all

379
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:17,079
these for liver patients, also all these for,
I mean it's horrible."

380
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:28,869
I said, "How can that be, on the contrary
to a mental patient if you make him bend forward

381
00:54:37,249 --> 00:54:44,249
he'll suffer more, he must bend backwards.
A person who is ego oriented should bend forward."

382
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:54,180
They changed of course, I mean they're sensible
people as well as I'm concerned, they believe

383
00:54:57,289 --> 00:55:04,289
in Me, they think in India of course I'm accepted
as some sort of a, something like that. But

384
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:12,499
you see these are little, little things they
don't know.

385
00:55:12,499 --> 00:55:17,789
Supposing a person is ego oriented, right-sided
person as we call it. Right-sided person if

386
00:55:17,789 --> 00:55:24,789
he tries to bend backwards he'll become even
worse. And a person who is a superego person,

387
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:33,140
suffering from mental troubles and all that
has to, not to bend forward at all, he has

388
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:41,739
to bend backwards. Because they're two types
of people, there are actually three types

389
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:50,619
as you know. The people who are, I mean, in
vulgar language we can call it masochist and

390
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:02,839
sadist but they are extreme cases, but I'm
saying that style. We call them tamo gunis

391
00:56:08,269 --> 00:56:15,269
and rajo gunis. So the rajo gunis the sadists,
if they become more like this, God save the

392
00:56:18,029 --> 00:56:25,029
world, see the point? And the emotions are
drained out of such people, there no feelings

393
00:56:28,279 --> 00:56:30,559
left, no emotions, nothing, zero.

394
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:37,559
I met one dentist who came and he said, "Mother
now I have become a sthitapragya."

395
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,130
I said, "How?"

396
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:47,130
"I have no feelings. Nothing happens to me.
You see my child is sick I'm not bothered."

397
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:55,309
What a nice man you are. "I have no feelings.
My mother calls me I have no feelings. I am

398
00:56:57,559 --> 00:56:59,349
living somewhere alone."

399
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:06,349
I said, "All right." I said, "Is that the
way the saints have lived? They have been

400
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:17,339
worried not only about their people but about
everyone." There's no love. There's no love

401
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:28,410
in the modern yoga, no love. Is only the love
of God, can be only felt through Spirit. You

402
00:57:33,229 --> 00:57:40,229
have to have a balance. Is very one sided,
extremely one sided. One side is those who

403
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:54,239
are singing the devotional songs and the other
side are (inaudible). Both are equally mad

404
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:04,839
I tell you. Both can be equally mad. Come
to the balance, again you have to come to

405
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:13,469
the balance, otherwise you cannot enjoy Sahaja
Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is an enjoyment, enjoyment

406
00:58:13,469 --> 00:58:15,420
of your balance, of the beauty of God's love,
and the truth of His work. Everything has

407
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:16,160
to be enjoyed, all right. You just work it
out.

408
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,759
Shri Mataji: Have you done yoga very much?

409
00:58:18,759 --> 00:58:19,749
Seeker: Sorry?

410
00:58:19,749 --> 00:58:23,619
Shri Mataji: Have you done lot of yoga?

411
00:58:23,619 --> 00:58:29,949
Seeker: Reasonable. I do follow the Buddhist
practice which is based upon...

412
00:58:29,949 --> 00:58:36,759
Shri Mataji: Now Buddhist also! Now I'll tell
you about Buddhism, all right? What are Buddhists

413
00:58:36,759 --> 00:58:43,329
doing? Is true about everyone Christians,
Hindus, everybody. Just because you asked

414
00:58:43,329 --> 00:58:50,329
about Buddhist I must tell you. Where is Buddha
placed within us do they know? Where is Buddha?

415
00:58:55,180 --> 00:59:02,180
Buddha is placed within us at a point...
Seeker: Well, yes... Shri Mataji: And what

416
00:59:02,229 --> 00:59:09,229
does He control within us? We have to know
this knowledge of the roots. Unless and until

417
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:20,349
you know the knowledge of the roots how will
you know about the tree? You cannot treat

418
00:59:22,979 --> 00:59:29,979
the tree on its leaves or branches you have
to go to the roots. And first you find out

419
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:37,959
the roots within. Buddhism is so superficial
now, that I Myself amazed and Buddha must

420
00:59:37,959 --> 00:59:44,959
be thinking, oh God from where it has come.
He says "Buddham, Sharanam, Gachami." What

421
00:59:45,959 --> 00:59:52,959
is Buddha? Is an enlightened soul? Buddham
means the one who is enlightened. "Sangham

422
00:59:53,779 --> 01:00:00,779
sharanam gachami" means to the collective
being. Sangham means the collective being.

423
01:00:00,979 --> 01:00:07,979
"Dhamam sharanam gachami." Dhamam is the balance
within you. How many Buddhists know about

424
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:19,099
it? They don't know even where Buddha is sitting
on their heads. And what I find most of the

425
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:26,099
Buddhists that their center of Buddha is finished.
Buddha has disappeared from them once for

426
01:00:29,309 --> 01:00:29,789
all.

427
01:00:29,789 --> 01:00:36,789
He controls our ego, and he's settled down
here on the head on the left hand side. We

428
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:40,849
can prove it on Kundalini. Supposing somebody
is following Buddha immediately people will

429
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:47,849
know that you are a Buddhist because there's
a catch here. And then some methods are there

430
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:58,079
to awaken Him, if you awaken Him your Kundalini
will rise otherwise it won't, all right? So

431
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:09,410
you must know the knowledge of the roots.
We should not just depend on Budhhism or any

432
01:01:10,999 --> 01:01:13,239
"ism." That's what I'm saying.

433
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:20,239
Seeker: Yes, it's just the thing You said
in the beginning, I mean I agree...

434
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:32,380
Shri Mataji: Yes, you see we have to have
the complete integrated knowledge of the roots,

435
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:47,339
which nourishes, isn't it?

436
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:54,339
Seeker ask the question:- Are you advocating
a system or a practice to get closer to these

437
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,299
roots?

438
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:07,299
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no there is no system
about this. There is no system no practice,

439
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:15,900
no courses. Actually it is spontaneous. I'm
talking of your evolution. Your evolution

440
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:20,359
comes through a living force of the living
God. You cannot have a course in that, can

441
01:02:20,359 --> 01:02:27,359
you have? How do you sprout a seed? You have
to just put it in the Mother Earth it sprouts

442
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:37,380
by itself, is built in. In the same way within
you it's built in and it sprouts, that's all.

443
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:47,160
There's no course. Maybe you may not get it
today you'll get it tomorrow, some seeds sprout

444
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:48,410
faster.

445
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:55,410
Seeker makes a comment: I see the Buddhist
tradition as growing out of a yogic insight.

446
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:20,619
No, no, no, you are sadly mistaken about Buddhism.
The trouble is with the western people they're

447
01:03:31,969 --> 01:03:35,609
so fed up with Christianity that they think
Buddhism is going to solve the problem. They

448
01:03:35,609 --> 01:03:37,759
are just like any other Christian church,
take it from Me. All these lamas should be

449
01:03:37,759 --> 01:03:43,279
hanged by the nearest tree, I tell you. Horrible
people they are, horrible. You should see

450
01:03:43,279 --> 01:03:50,279
their vibrations. You know this Dalai Lama
when they're sitting next to Me, I was invited

451
01:03:51,279 --> 01:03:58,279
to the Prime Minister's place, I just couldn't
bear him. And the Prime Minister Lal Bahadur

452
01:03:59,009 --> 01:04:06,009
Shastri himself was a realized soul and he
could feel it and he said, "Is he very hot?"

453
01:04:13,829 --> 01:04:14,479
I said, "Yes."

454
01:04:14,479 --> 01:04:18,769
Is in Hindi he said, "He's an extremely hot
fellow." He said, "All right, you get on the

455
01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:23,789
other side," he made the foreign minister
sit here.

456
01:04:23,789 --> 01:04:30,390
You won't understand, just now you don't understand.
Even a little child who is a realized soul

457
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:33,890
will understand, but you won't because you're
not yet realized, this is the point. The difference

458
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:40,890
is you are mentally understanding. I have
a grand daughter she was hardly five years

459
01:04:50,949 --> 01:04:57,949
of age when My daughter and the son-in-law
went to Ladakh, it's an interesting story.

460
01:05:02,859 --> 01:05:04,839
And there was a lama sitting you see like
this, and everybody was touching his feet.

461
01:05:04,839 --> 01:05:06,390
This little child was a realized soul, she
couldn't bear it any more, when the father

462
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:10,309
went and touched his foot she just stood back
and she said, "What do you mean by shaving

463
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:17,309
your head and wearing this big stuff you think
you are a realized soul? Why are you making

464
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:24,319
everybody touch your feet?" Just she stood
up. And My son-in-law felt quite embarrassed

465
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,749
and he told that he's not even a realized
soul why do you touch his feet. You won't

466
01:05:26,749 --> 01:05:29,009
understand, even a little child will understand,
you won't understand. Realized soul is a person

467
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:29,259
who can feel it.

468
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:33,180
This is what Buddha has said, that's the traditional
thing, he has said, "First of all seek yourself."

469
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:38,829
Buddha didn't talk about God. Why, because
he thought if you talk about God again another

470
01:05:38,829 --> 01:05:44,259
religion will start. He just said first of
all, as I say, "First of all seek yourself,

471
01:05:44,259 --> 01:05:47,219
get your Self-Realization. Nothing else but
get your Realization." All right that's it.

472
01:05:47,219 --> 01:05:49,489
So better have it, better have it. You see
you have Buddhism there's nothing like "ism"

473
01:05:49,489 --> 01:05:50,170
about Buddha these people are mental. To have
it means to get Realization. What tradition

474
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:50,660
are they following, carrying that ring like
this, like that, mad kip (sic) people, horrible.

475
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:50,910
Is that what Buddha did? He sought His Realization.
He didn't do all these nonsensical things

476
01:05:50,759 --> 01:05:51,009
these lamas. And they even beat people and
do all kinds of things, horrible cruel people.

477
01:05:50,859 --> 01:05:51,839
Thank God there out of that Lhasa. You should
see the Tibetans now they're sitting on our

478
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:52,589
heads like parasites in India and we had a
parliament question on them. You see they

479
01:05:52,589 --> 01:05:52,979
look very attractive because you are fed up
with your Christianity, that's what. Don't

480
01:05:52,979 --> 01:05:53,229
believe in all these please whether they're
Hindus, Christians or Muslim, all are just

481
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:53,369
the same. There's no difference. You become
the realized soul first of all. You have to

482
01:05:53,319 --> 01:05:56,689
be the Buddha, all right, that's what I am
saying as a Mother.

483
01:05:56,689 --> 01:05:57,109
And then they started another one Shambhala
business you see. This is another new thing.

484
01:05:57,109 --> 01:05:58,880
Taking everybody to Gobi Desert to get samadhi.
Walk in that Gobi Desert even one mile you'll

485
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,749
get a samadhi permanently. [laughter] You
can't even get a glass of water there to drink,

486
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:02,660
My child. What things they are preaching,
you don't know, all nonsense. In Spain some

487
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:03,579
Spanish people have started this nonsense.
They are recruiting people to go to Gobi Desert.

488
01:06:03,579 --> 01:06:04,069
I mean what is going to happen to them? Think
of the Gobi Desert, is one of the worst deserts

489
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:05,130
of the world. Can you imagine going to a desert,
how will you reach God? You have to seek Him

490
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:05,549
within yourself. He's within, all right?

491
01:06:05,549 --> 01:06:06,969
Question from seeker:- Mother please tell
us about the dangers of mis-using mantras

492
01:06:06,969 --> 01:06:07,239
by religious sects.

493
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:08,699
Shri Mataji: Mantras, all right, dangers of
mantras? You see mantra is a thing by which

494
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:10,259
you awaken the Deity within you. The Deity,
which is on this chakra. Now here the chakras

495
01:06:10,259 --> 01:06:14,609
and we have deities. On these we have to awaken
the Deities. So, a person who is awakened

496
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:16,059
himself can only tell you what mantra to be
said, isn't it, a simple thing as that? The

497
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:18,339
one who has no eyes, what can he tell to another
blind person? So first an enlightened soul,

498
01:06:18,339 --> 01:06:19,839
who knows about chakras can only tell you
what chakras are catching within you. But

499
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:20,089
the Kundalini should solve. Supposing you
are just now caught in your Nabhi chakra and

500
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,969
I tell you that you say the mantra. Not that
you, but the realized soul should say the

501
01:06:22,969 --> 01:06:28,969
mantra and awaken that. Maybe the Kundalini
has gone there, so from there you have to

502
01:06:28,969 --> 01:06:34,400
come here. You have to see the movement of
the Kundalini. Like a car is going now, very

503
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,799
simple, the car is going so we come to a toll
gate, all right. There we have to pay the

504
01:06:39,799 --> 01:06:40,459
toll. But where the car is going, and then
there is a toll gate you pay there to a particular

505
01:06:40,459 --> 01:06:41,199
toll gate, isn't it? Like when you are going
you see -

506
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:43,269
(Shri Mataji speaks aside: I've given up tea.
I have, just given up. Just take it. Sixty

507
01:06:43,269 --> 01:06:45,459
years I thought I have drunk too much of tea.
But that doesn't mean you should give up.

508
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:45,709
[laughter])

509
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:50,299
So you see the thing is the movement of the
Kundalini will only tell you which chakra

510
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:53,299
is catching, all right, otherwise you will
not know. Unless until you move the car, before

511
01:06:53,299 --> 01:06:58,809
that, how will you know where the car is going
to get the toll. Can you pay it before the

512
01:06:58,809 --> 01:06:59,709
car starts?

513
01:06:59,709 --> 01:07:06,309
So what happens, if they give you a mantra
mostly people don't know what they're doing.

514
01:07:06,309 --> 01:07:13,309
You see it is a big enterprise. Giving mantras
is a very big enterprise. Like they have given

515
01:07:14,369 --> 01:07:19,239
mantras, which I was amazed to hear, if you
tell some Indians, they'll be laughing at

516
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:25,269
you. What they say is a great secret, and
the mantras they gave was, one was I heard,

517
01:07:25,269 --> 01:07:26,400
was "tinga" means like this you show to someone
you see this is "tinga", in Hindi language.

518
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,930
There is nothing like "ing" in Sanskrit Language.
Another mantra I heard was "inga". "Inga"

519
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:35,930
means the tail of the, the sting of a scorpion,
can you imagine that could be it. And then,

520
01:07:54,890 --> 01:08:01,890
where is the director of the flying squad,
is he there? He's hiding there at the back.

521
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:11,119
Now what is the mantra for they gave you for
flying? What tubes? Who is there? Come along

522
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:11,369
where is he?

523
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:11,400
Yogi: "Bronchial tubes, Mother."

524
01:08:11,189 --> 01:08:11,439
Shri Mataji: Bronchial tubes. Bronchial tubes,
bronchial tubes, they paid six thousand pounds

525
01:08:11,319 --> 01:08:11,569
for getting that mantra for you. [laughter]
Just imagine this bronchial tube is one of

526
01:08:11,469 --> 01:08:11,719
them. Then they'll give a mantra of Rama.
Take a more sensible thing, they might give

527
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:13,839
a mantra of Rama. But Rama where does He exist?
Supposing I want to give a mantra of Buddha,

528
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:14,089
for example. Where is Buddha? Are you catching
on Buddha or not, is the main point. Where

529
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:14,140
are you catching? Where is Rama? Rama resides
in what part? Is it necessary to give this

530
01:08:13,939 --> 01:08:14,189
mantra or not? They don't know anything, no
knowledge of any kind just at random. At the

531
01:08:13,979 --> 01:08:14,229
age of six years to twenty years give the
mantra what is it, "pinga" then another one

532
01:08:14,029 --> 01:08:14,279
"tinga", another "ringa", according to the
age, not according to the Kundalin where it

533
01:08:14,059 --> 01:08:14,309
is. Now what is the danger of that, that's
the main point is. That supposing they give

534
01:08:14,109 --> 01:08:14,359
you a name of Rama, they are not awakened
people they are not connected with God, they

535
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:14,410
are not authorized. Now you go on saying Rama,
Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama like

536
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:14,449
that, you see. The other way round you say
mara, mara means I'm dead, I'm dead I'm dead.

537
01:08:14,249 --> 01:08:14,499
So you go on saying a mantra Rama, Rama, Rama,
now what happens that you are not connected

538
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:14,549
with Rama at all, because you are not a realized
soul, neither the guru, the one who has taken

539
01:08:14,349 --> 01:08:14,599
three thousand pounds for giving you this
Rama mantra, is a realized soul. So when you

540
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:14,640
are shouting like that Rama, Rama, Rama, who
will come to your help will be somebody dead

541
01:08:14,479 --> 01:08:14,729
as Mr. Rama somewhere. He will come to your
help and he'll possess you. With that you

542
01:08:14,499 --> 01:08:14,749
may start thinking because you get an added
personality and suddenly you feel you see

543
01:08:14,519 --> 01:08:14,769
you get more powers so called.

544
01:08:14,529 --> 01:08:16,259
Like Gauguin if you go on saying Gauguin,
Gauguin, Gauguin he might enter into you.

545
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:19,469
You might start painting something and after
that finished you have no energy left because

546
01:08:19,469 --> 01:08:19,719
one horse is riding two men. But the worse
thing that happens to you by saying mantra

547
01:08:19,589 --> 01:08:19,839
is that you develop a terrible dent in this
very important center called Vishuddhi, specially

548
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:19,920
the left Vishuddhi. And then they are frightened.
If you ask them, "What is your mantra?"

549
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:20,160
"Mother I won't tell you."

550
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,170
"Why?"

551
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:20,180
"No that is not to be told."

552
01:08:19,949 --> 01:08:20,199
All secrets in God's vision, in God's realm
there should be no secret at all, everything

553
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:20,259
should be known, everybody should know what
is what. Why should there be any secrets,

554
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:20,500
I can't understand. For example everybody
will know those who are realized souls, where

555
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:20,750
you are catching, what is your chakra, they'll
tell you. Everybody will say the same. Like

556
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,980
one day one gentleman came he said, "Why are
they all coming and asking me 'How is your

557
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:22,330
father?'" I said, "Because your Rama's chakra
is catching." That's exactly the mantra you

558
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:24,100
will take. So your chakra is caught, that
is the one that the name they give you because

559
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,679
you're insulting the deity and this Vishuddhi
chakra, by which you say also is caught up,

560
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:29,909
and from there it goes as guilt to the left.
If you should try to correct a person it acts

561
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:33,679
as a guilt and he gets a problem on the left
hand side Vishuddhi which is a very, very

562
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:33,929
big problem.

563
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:33,929
Seeker: Japanese religious sect gives Buddhist
mantra called Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. )

564
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:33,929
Shri Mataji: Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, I know.
You see Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a great thing,

565
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:33,929
but not by these Japanese people. Japanese
less said the better. I met the person called,

566
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:33,929
his name I have forgotten. He was the head
of the Zen system. Now see Zen is Sahaja Yoga.

567
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:33,929
To be realized is to be Zen. But this fellow
had a frozen Kundalini just like that there

568
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:33,929
just sitting settled down. So I told him,
"Sir with very humble understanding I would

569
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:33,929
like to say, that are you really a Zen?"

570
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:33,929
He said, "I'm teaching Zen, but I'm not."

571
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:33,929
I said, "Why?"

572
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:33,929
He said, "Altogether from the sixth century
till today, only up to the eight century we

573
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:33,929
had Prashapas [MAYBE Prashapas or Pashyapas
or Kashyapas - SG] means realized souls."

574
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:33,929
Only till the eighth century and after that
what followed was this kind of people who

575
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:33,989
had the Kundalini just settled down there.
But at least he was honest. And he was suffering

576
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:34,000
from a horrible disease for which he came
to Me. So I said, "At least you do not propagate

577
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:34,009
now Zen, because you are not a Zen."

578
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:34,009
You are a Christian, are you? Ask anyone who
is he. This artificial baptism is not Christianity.

579
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:34,020
Is the real baptism, raising of the Kundalini.
Is the Kundalini piercing through? Are you

580
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:34,029
a muslim? You are not because you are not
a pir, you are to be a realized soul first.

581
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:34,040
So imagine all these people who are teaching
all these things are not authorized at all.

582
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:34,040
But they'll come round, I'm sure.

583
01:08:33,799 --> 01:08:34,049
Seeker asks a question: I was interested in
Your comment when You said Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

584
01:08:33,799 --> 01:08:34,049
is fine but not any Japanese...

585
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:34,190
Shri Mataji: You see now I'll tell you. It
is very simple to understand, you understand

586
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:35,290
one point which you are missing all the time.
Is this that supposing there is a constable

587
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:35,630
standing there and he says, "Go this way,"
all right, we have to obey him otherwise you'll

588
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:35,969
end in jail he's authorized, isn't it? But
supposing I go and stand there and say, "Go

589
01:08:35,969 --> 01:08:36,329
this way," they'll put Me in jail. They have
no authority from God to do it because they

590
01:08:36,329 --> 01:08:36,670
are not realized souls. The same mantra becomes
a great mantra when it comes from an authorized

591
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:37,009
person from God. But the same mantra becomes
a sinful thing when it comes from a person

592
01:08:37,009 --> 01:08:37,309
who is not authorized, who's just commercialized
it. [Seeker interrupts] Is it gone into your

593
01:08:37,309 --> 01:08:37,579
head what I told you, that you are to be authorized
by God? That is you should be self-realized.

594
01:08:37,579 --> 01:08:37,829
If you are not self-realized you have no right
to give any mantras or anything, do you follow

595
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:37,980
this point, simple point.

596
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:37,989
Seeker: Sure.

597
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:37,989
Shri Mataji: Now that's all. So you get your
Realization, that's important, which you should.

598
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:37,989
But I don't know how it works out, you see
that is not My guarantee. If it works out

599
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:38,000
well and good, may not work out today. So
better put attention to that, it's important.

600
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,009
May God Bless you.

601
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,009
Is there any other question now?

602
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:38,020
Put attention to that, that is important.
But one thing more, when you follow them you

603
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:38,020
never ask questions. I had one lady from a
lama she came down from Norway, she was horrid,

604
01:08:37,779 --> 01:08:38,029
absolutely horrid. Her vibrations were, what
was her name Gavin?

605
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:38,040
Gavin: Pia

606
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:38,040
Shri Mataji: Pia. She came to My house I said,
"Baba! How to raise her Kundalini, baba, dreadful."

607
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:38,049
And she was thinking no end of herself and
arguing, arguing with Me throughout, and all

608
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:38,049
that. I said, "How did you happen," I mean
she has been to this lama. I said, "What happened?"

609
01:08:37,809 --> 01:08:38,059
She said, "No, he wrote to us that I can't
live in an ordinary house you have to make

610
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:38,069
a marble floor. So first we all starved ourselves,
within one year we collected money made a

611
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:38,079
marble floor for the fellow. So he came and
was sitting on the seventh step and we were

612
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:38,089
first one year we had to just go and bow to
him just like this."

613
01:08:37,849 --> 01:08:38,099
One thousand and one time can you imagine
everyday and "I've done that course." But

614
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:38,109
I said, "Didn't you argue with him?"

615
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:38,109
She said, "No."

616
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:38,109
Then I said, "Why are you arguing with Me?"
Of course I like that you argue because that

617
01:08:37,869 --> 01:08:38,119
shows you are free to argue, I've not mesmerized
you, but must see the sense.

618
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:38,130
How do we accept Buddha, let's see. Have you
seen Buddha? Have you met him? Have you met

619
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:38,130
anybody who is a Buddhist who says he can
give Realization? But then why are we the

620
01:08:37,889 --> 01:08:38,139
pleaders of Buddha whom we have never seen,
who has gone away, we don't know anything

621
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:38,150
about Him. Why? Because I am living He is
not. When He was living there were people

622
01:08:37,909 --> 01:08:38,159
who were asking about other people. So better
be in the present and get it your Realization,

623
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:38,170
all right, that's what it is. That's what
happened with Buddha he couldn't give Realization

624
01:08:37,929 --> 01:08:38,179
to anyone whatsoever. Sariputa, Mogallana,
all were wasted people. Same with Christ.

625
01:08:37,929 --> 01:08:38,179
Because when Krishna came they said, "What
about Rama?" When Rama came they said, "What

626
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:38,190
about Dattatreya?" But where is Dattatreya
now? Rama is standing here why not get it

627
01:08:37,949 --> 01:08:38,199
from Him. So everybody failed. They said,
"They are talking about the past only." What

628
01:08:37,949 --> 01:08:38,199
about the present? You are sitting before
Me, I am sitting before you, have your Realization.

629
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:38,210
Why argue about it? If there's a diamond and
if I say you can have it free will you argue?

630
01:08:37,969 --> 01:08:38,219
You understand diamond better than our Spirit.
Always we did that but this time better not

631
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:38,230
miss it. I'm telling you better have your
Realization, it's important. Of course Buddha

632
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:38,239
plays a very big role within us but first
get your Spirit otherwise it has no authority.

633
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:38,239
The knowledge of Buddha has no authority within
you unless and until you become the Buddha

634
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,250
yourself. All right, now let's have it. At
the end of it I would request you to have

635
01:08:38,009 --> 01:08:38,259
your Realization.

636
01:08:38,009 --> 01:08:38,259
Put your hands like this towards Me just like
this. Better now, relaxed, all right, nice.

637
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:38,270
Put your hands like this. It works, it works
that's the point is, it should work, isn't

638
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:38,279
it? Now close your eyes, please. Just close
your eyes, you have to keep your eyes shut

639
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:38,290
that's important because when the Kundalini
rises above the Agnya chakra if your eyes

640
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:38,290
are not closed it will fall down, so please
close your eyes. There's no mesmerism that's

641
01:08:38,049 --> 01:08:38,299
why you have to close your eyes. Just keep
your eyes shut.

642
01:08:38,059 --> 01:08:38,309
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: Take the baby out,
please.]

643
01:08:38,059 --> 01:08:38,309
Just sit comfortably don't move, don't make
any gestures nothing, nothing outward. You

644
01:08:38,069 --> 01:08:38,319
have to be inside, it will work out inside.
Nothing should work out outside. Just keep

645
01:08:38,069 --> 01:08:38,319
quiet. Just put your hand towards Me. Whatever
has to work out will work out inside, not

646
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:38,329
outside. Don't open your eyes but don't fix
your attention anywhere, keep it loose, just

647
01:08:38,089 --> 01:08:38,339
keep it loose, don't fix it at a point, please.
Don't try to fix it at - some people are fixing

648
01:08:38,099 --> 01:08:38,349
it at the point what we call the Agnya chakra
or anything. At the most you can put your

649
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:38,359
attention on top of your head. But don't try
to fix it anywhere keep it loose, absolutely

650
01:08:38,119 --> 01:08:38,369
loose. Now with your right hand, which is
the hand of your creativity or the action

651
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:38,380
power, you have to use the right hand to express
your action and the left hand is a desire.

652
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:38,380
So you have to put the left hand towards Me
for the desire but don't open your eyes, just

653
01:08:38,139 --> 01:08:38,389
on the lap you can keep it comfortably as
it is and you have to just move your right

654
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:38,400
hand but keep the fingers straight. Straight
fingers toward Me and move the right hand

655
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:38,409
as I tell you.

656
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:38,409
No, on the lap left hand on the lap and the
right hand I'll tell you how to move it. Now

657
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:38,420
put the right hand, no left hand toward Me.
Sahaja Yogis should see left hand towards

658
01:08:38,179 --> 01:08:38,429
Me now move the right hand. Left hand on your
lap comfortably, please put left hand on your

659
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:38,440
lap. Left hand on your lap, yes very comfortably.

660
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:38,440
Now the right hand you have to put it on your
heart. Heart where resides your Spirit. Now

661
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:38,449
in your heart you have to ask a question to
Me, "Mother am I the Spirit?" Just put it

662
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:38,460
on the right hand side. Those who are very
much on the left but actually it is on the

663
01:08:38,219 --> 01:08:38,469
left hand side is the heart. You see those
who are putting it too much toward the left

664
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:38,480
should put it at the proper place of your
heart is on the left hand side. Now press

665
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:38,489
it with your fingers. And just ask a question,
"Mother am I the spirit?" Say it thrice, ask

666
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:38,500
a question with full confidence.
Now please put this right hand, don't open

667
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:38,500
your eyes, on your stomach on the left hand
side again. Lower part of the stomach and

668
01:08:38,259 --> 01:08:38,509
push it and ask the question again to Me,
"Mother am I my own Master, am I my own Guru?"

669
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:38,520
Because you are, and this Spirit is your Guru.
But when you are asking Me a question, "Mother

670
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:38,529
am I the Spirit?" you have to ask the second
question, "Mother am I my own Guru, am I my

671
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:38,540
own Spirit?" Because the Spirit is the Guru,
which is awakened within you, when you get

672
01:08:38,299 --> 01:08:38,549
your Realization. So you have to say, "Mother
am I my own Guru?" Say it ten times. Ask the

673
01:08:38,309 --> 01:08:38,559
question ten times. The times are according
to the chakras.

674
01:08:38,309 --> 01:08:38,559
Keep the left hand the same way and now put
again the right hand on the heart. And now

675
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:38,569
you assert with confidence that, "Mother I
am the Spirit," which you are. This you have

676
01:08:38,329 --> 01:08:38,579
to do it twelve times, twelve times. Ten plus
two, twelve times you have to say, "Mother

677
01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:38,589
I am the Spirit." With confidence, with full
confidence you should say, "Mother I am the

678
01:08:38,349 --> 01:08:38,599
Spirit," full confidence.

679
01:08:38,349 --> 01:08:38,599
Now take this right hand across to the left
side of your neck, left side of your neck.

680
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:38,609
Again was I said left Vishuddhi. Because the
Spirit is immaculate, absolute, it never does

681
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:38,609
any mistakes so there is no question of feeling
guilty. So you have to say sixteen times now

682
01:08:38,369 --> 01:08:38,619
that, "Mother I am not guilty." Say it sixteen
times, again with full confidence, because

683
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:38,630
we're talking about God Almighty who is the
ocean of love, ocean of forgiveness, ocean

684
01:08:38,389 --> 01:08:38,639
of compassion, sixteen times.

685
01:08:38,389 --> 01:08:38,639
Now again raise the left hand without opening
your eyes, to your forehead. Across your forehead,

686
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:38,650
across your forehead, and hold your forehead
in your hand, right hand, left hand being

687
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:38,650
towards Me. At this point is the Agnya chakra
where you have to say that, "Mother I forgive

688
01:08:38,409 --> 01:08:38,659
everyone." Now some of you might say that
I cannot forgive is a very common thing people

689
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:38,670
tell Me. But when you don't forgive what you
are doing is to play into the hands of people

690
01:08:38,429 --> 01:08:38,679
who try to harm you. So you just say, "Mother
I forgive everyone." With full understanding,

691
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:38,690
without any reservation, "I forgive everyone."
Unless and until you forgive everyone how

692
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:38,690
can God forgive you? So let God forgive you
for your mistakes what you have done in your

693
01:08:38,449 --> 01:08:38,699
ignorance but don't feel guilty about it.
Only you just say, "Mother I forgive everyone."

694
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:38,710
Now put this hand on top of your head, right
hand again where the soft bone was there when

695
01:08:38,469 --> 01:08:38,719
you were a child. Press it with your palm
that portion and move it in a clockwise manner.

696
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:38,730
Press that palm and move it in a clockwise
manner. Now at this point I cannot cross your

697
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:38,739
freedom. It's your freedom, which I respect,
you have to say that you want ealization.

698
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:38,739
So, here you have to say, "Mother we want
our realization. Please give us the Realization,"

699
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:38,750
otherwise I cannot cross. So please say this
seven times.

700
01:08:38,509 --> 01:08:38,759
Now you can raise your hand and see if there
is a cool breeze coming. Some people might

701
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:38,770
be getting the heat coming out of their heads.
Raise it higher to see if there is a cool

702
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:38,779
breeze coming out. So many of you are still
feeling guilty, is a wrong thing. I've told

703
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:38,779
you not to feel guilty. Just see if there
is a cool breeze coming out. Now you can take

704
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:38,790
another hand, left hand and see with your
left hand. You can change over and see if

705
01:08:38,549 --> 01:08:38,799
there is a cool breeze coming out. Not very

706
01:08:38,559 --> 01:08:38,809
You can change over another hand.
