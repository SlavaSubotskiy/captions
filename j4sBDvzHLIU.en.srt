1
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:22,058
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

2
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:31,058
As Dr. Warren has told you, that the blossom time has come.

3
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:37,819
You could never have found so many seekers,

4
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:40,058
on this Earth,

5
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:44,179
say even before 50 years.

6
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:48,139
Suddenly so many seekers have been born,

7
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:52,939
who are seeking something beyond.

8
00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:00,139
They are not satisfied with rationality,

9
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:06,539
with materialism, with all the ideologies given

10
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,779
by the people who talk that that we should be satisfied

11
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:14,819
with ourselves

12
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:18,819
as far as matter goes

13
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,139
or as far as mental projection is concerned.

14
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,339
They want to know that there must be something beyond.

15
00:01:29,058 --> 00:01:33,059
And thus we find

16
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,299
there is a great

17
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:42,219
shopping center that has opened especially in your country,

18
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:46,339
of all those people who think they can surprise us.

19
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:50,339
That is one of the signs which were described even by Christ.

20
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,339
Of course in our country,

21
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:55,058
there are books and books written

22
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,179
about those people who will come here

23
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:03,259
as fake people and take full advantage of your seeking.

24
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:10,659
Now the problem with the Western mind is this,

25
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:15,058
that it does not understand the dangers

26
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:18,539
of getting into all kinds of things,

27
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:24,179
and that is why they are really

28
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,299
[led] into things

29
00:02:27,058 --> 00:02:29,339
where they should not have been.

30
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:31,939
And they have no knowledge also,

31
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:36,019
in a way what to expect

32
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:40,299
of themselves.

33
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:44,899
When they are seeking, what should be expected?

34
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:47,259
What should happen to us?

35
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,058
What is the criteria that we are realized souls?

36
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:59,058
Which is the way we can find out that we have got our Realization?

37
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:07,099
As it is, there is so much of book-knowledge, the worst,

38
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:10,899
as Shankaracharya calls as, calls it shabda jaalam,

39
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,819
the net of worse.

40
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:15,899
And people were lost in those words.

41
00:03:16,058 --> 00:03:19,058
The books are there, the words are there,

42
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,219
and the people start thinking that

43
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:27,259
by reading these books or by understanding them mentally,

44
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,299
or some of them think by remembering by heart,

45
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:33,539
they will achieve their Realization.

46
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:40,419
That means Realization is only for people, who are able to read.

47
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:44,058
And what about the people who cannot read?

48
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,339
Are they not going to evolve?

49
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:48,058
Perhaps they are going to evolve much faster

50
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:50,058
than the people who can read.

51
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:52,939
Because they have no complications in their heads.

52
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:55,259
They are simple, straight forward people.

53
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:58,058
I've seen the example of that in India.

54
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:00,779
Not only that, but they are very sensitive.

55
00:04:01,058 --> 00:04:02,779
It's because they live with the Mother Earth

56
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,019
They are extremely sensitive.

57
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:07,939
They know a tug, they know a cheat,

58
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:11,019
they know a hypocrite and they know the reality.

59
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:15,058
While where people live with artificialities,

60
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:16,939
with artificial love,

61
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:19,099
it's impossible for them to judge,

62
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:22,059
what is real and what is artificial.

63
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:26,819
As I told you before, that minimum of minimum,

64
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:31,058
you must cancel all the people who live on your money.

65
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:33,339
They are parasites, in simple words.

66
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,459
Or they may be your servants.

67
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,099
But they cannot be the people who can deliver the goods.

68
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,779
If they are poor, they live like poor people.

69
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:47,058
If they are rich, they live there, but absolutely detached.

70
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:52,219
Now, what should we expect?

71
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:55,099
What should happen to us,

72
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:58,819
when we say that "I have got Realization".

73
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:04,379
This is the point people do not know they are not educated in that.

74
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,379
They are naive about it,

75
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:11,059
and that's why people have taken full advantage of their ignorance.

76
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:13,299
I came ten years back,

77
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:17,939
and told them frankly about all these things, with names and things,

78
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:19,259
But they didn’t like Me.

79
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:21,379
They said, "Why should You stop us from doing all these?"

80
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:22,939
I said, "Go ahead."

81
00:05:23,058 --> 00:05:26,819
But now what I find most of them are lost.

82
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:29,058
They have just became like cabbages.

83
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:33,859
They are so mesmerized, they don’t know what they are doing,

84
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:36,179
where they have to go.

85
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:44,179
Now if the Spirit has to shine within us,

86
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:47,939
what should happen, what is Self Realization?

87
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:51,259
Let’s see if there is a light in this room,

88
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:54,899
if you become the light, you don’t see the light.

89
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:59,179
But through that you can see everyone, the light can see everyone.

90
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:03,499
And what do you see? First you must see yourself.

91
00:06:04,058 --> 00:06:06,219
You have never faced yourself.

92
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,739
People become mad.

93
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:11,939
Till they are mad they don’t know that they are becoming mad.

94
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:16,459
They get cancers, their diseases in the body is crawling up.

95
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,259
They don’t know they got the disease, there’s any problem.

96
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:22,299
They just continue with the life, without understanding.

97
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:25,499
They have no way of finding out,

98
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:28,739
or diagnosis cannot be done by them.

99
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:31,379
But once you become the Spirit,

100
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:35,058
the Spirit when it emits through your fingers,

101
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:39,058
when you start feeling enlightenment of your fingertips,

102
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:44,139
you can feel what’s wrong with your chakras, means your centers.

103
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:46,739
Now somebody can decode it

104
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,939
and tell you, that this fingers means that,

105
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:51,139
this finger means that, this finger means that,

106
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:55,299
the combination and permutations of these seven centers,

107
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:59,019
one two, three four, five, six, seven, as shown here.

108
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:02,419
We have marked with the colors to show you

109
00:07:03,058 --> 00:07:06,019
that how on the finger, hands,

110
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:08,179
feet have different, but hands,

111
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:14,859
you see the effect of those centers when you are enlightened.

112
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:18,058
Before that you cannot. Because you are like a computer.

113
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:19,939
You are really a computer, otherwise

114
00:07:20,058 --> 00:07:22,339
also if you want to see rationally

115
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,299
that you see something and you don’t think about it, but you see.

116
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,179
What a perfect computer you are already.

117
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:32,939
But the computer becomes

118
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:36,058
a part and parcel of your awareness.

119
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:39,859
You sort of become the master of that computer

120
00:07:40,058 --> 00:07:44,019
so that you can understand the decoding,

121
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:49,058
and the maneuvering of all the processes of that computer.

122
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,819
This computer is beautifully made,

123
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:54,058
Is very beautifully made as you can see it.

124
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:55,899
Is not a mix bag,

125
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,939
as most of the psychologists believe

126
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:00,259
that you have to go to the subconscious,

127
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:03,259
to get to the higher super consciousness.

128
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:05,899
Here you can see on the left hand side

129
00:08:06,058 --> 00:08:08,099
is the subconscious and the collective subconscious.

130
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:11,979
On the right hand side you have got this supraconscious

131
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:15,058
that is the future and the collective supraconscious.

132
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:18,339
Down below is what you call the hell,

133
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,058
and on top is the superconsciousness.

134
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:24,179
To rise there is a passage kept very firmly.

135
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,179
You have to pass through these centers

136
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:29,058
and whatever problems are in the centers

137
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:33,899
if you start feeling on your fingertips and know how to cure them,

138
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:40,058
you can make your Kundalini rise very nicely and establish Agnya.

139
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:44,859
All these knowledge can be yours, very easily,

140
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,058
but the first thing is that you have to get your Realization.

141
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,539
Unless and until there is light,

142
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:54,058
and if I tell you, this is not a snake, this is just a cord,

143
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:56,179
you are not going to believe it.

144
00:08:57,058 --> 00:09:01,899
The light has to come to give you the complete idea about yourself,

145
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:03,539
so you know yourself.

146
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:07,019
First of all you must know physically what is wrong.

147
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:11,179
Secondly you must know what's wrong with you mentally.

148
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:14,259
Now people who are ego oriented.

149
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:18,939
They torture others, they aggress others,

150
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:23,859
but they don’t know that they are full of ego.

151
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:25,939
The people who are superego,

152
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:28,539
means those who take tortures upon others,

153
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:30,859
they start indulging into their miseries

154
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:32,939
and start saying, "I must suffer,

155
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:36,058
I must have done something wrong, so I must suffer".

156
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:38,179
They accept that kind of a life.

157
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:41,179
But after Realization you understand

158
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:45,259
that you are not your ego or superego, but you are your Self.

159
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:49,058
And you are not to suffer, nor do you have to aggress anyone.

160
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:51,899
Nor you have to take aggression from anyone,

161
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,539
but you stand in the center, as the light.

162
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:58,899
You have to just have to just

163
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:02,459
have the source of joy flowing into you.

164
00:10:03,058 --> 00:10:06,339
All the time you have to get connected to the whole,

165
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,379
so that you are looked after by the whole.

166
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:13,059
You become part and parcel of the whole. You are part and parcel,

167
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:16,058
but you are not aware. You become aware of it.

168
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:17,939
So the first thing happens to you

169
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:21,299
that you come to know about your physical side and

170
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:24,179
mental side, whether you are emotional

171
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:27,499
or whether you are ego oriented.

172
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:30,979
Then you start in the center.

173
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:32,819
When I’m talking to you

174
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:34,499
maybe you are thinking of your past

175
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:37,459
or maybe you are thinking about of you future at this time.

176
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:40,979
But if I say that pay attention to yourself, you cannot pay.

177
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,899
Your attention is outside.

178
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:44,939
That is why this happening takes place,

179
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:47,379
which attracts your attention inside.

180
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:51,179
And when the attention is attracted inside,

181
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:54,139
then you start seeing yourself clearly,

182
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,219
understanding yourself, "That is the matter with me".

183
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:02,058
What's wrong with the world today is wrong with every individual.

184
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:06,058
If the individuals improve, the whole world is going to improve.

185
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:12,058
So physically and mentally you get perfectly all right.

186
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:15,058
All kinds of diseases can be cured by Sahaja Yoga;

187
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:18,419
you can cure yourself, I don’t have to cure you.

188
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,979
Because you become empowered by that.

189
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:26,058
Secondly, you also know what is wrong with you, Spiritually.

190
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:28,779
Supposing you have been to a wrong guru,

191
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:34,058
supposing you have been mesmerized by a wrong person,

192
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:36,139
now how are you going to know

193
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:38,459
whether he is wrong or a right person?

194
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,419
How will you find out? Supposing Christ comes stands before you,

195
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,099
how will you recognize Christ?

196
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,259
Have you any way of finding out?

197
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,179
Anybody who talks sweetly

198
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:53,179
has all these professional methods of enticing you,

199
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,179
you can fall a pray to that.

200
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:59,899
But after Realization you find from your hand

201
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:03,259
a new kind of a vibratory awareness is going.

202
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,939
Through these vibrations you can find out

203
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,099
whether the person is false, hypocritical or a devil.

204
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:14,859
If he is a devil you might even get blisters on your hand.

205
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:19,819
And that's how you correct your Spiritual

206
00:12:20,058 --> 00:12:22,219
seeking when you have gone wrong.

207
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:24,019
If you know how to correct it,

208
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:28,739
the methods which are very simple, the movement of your hands,

209
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:30,939
you can get out of that.

210
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:34,899
Many people as you must have known, that who have been to cults,

211
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:39,419
had fake gurus, have suffered. They have become like cabbages.

212
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:45,499
But all those people can be saved if they get their Realization

213
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,259
and gradually understand their power of getting out of it.

214
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:55,019
Because Spirit is self-powered, it works on itself.

215
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,779
So first of all you know about yourself.

216
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:03,058
As a result of that, you drop off all your habits.

217
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:07,058
Supposing there is a black spot on my sari,

218
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:11,058
I cannot see and I am identified with it,

219
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:14,058
so anybody tells me there is black spot, I won’t like it.

220
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:20,058
But supposing I can see it, then I clean it myself.

221
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:27,299
When the nectar or ambrosia of God’s love starts flowing in you,

222
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,019
you just don’t need to drink, you just don't need to smoke,

223
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:34,499
you are no more a slave of any habits.

224
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:36,059
You just become a free bird.

225
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:40,058
That’s the real freedom, that nothing can entice you,

226
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:42,019
nothing can enslave you.

227
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:44,819
You become so integrated that if you don’t want it,

228
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:47,499
you just don’t want it. Then your body will support you,

229
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,939
your mind will support you, your Spirit will support you.

230
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:52,499
You are completely integrated at that point.

231
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,299
That is the first thing happens to you,

232
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:58,058
as a person who comes to Sahaja Yoga;

233
00:13:58,219 --> 00:14:01,179
I’ve seen many of them, were alcoholics.

234
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:04,058
We have some artists in India, were great alcoholics.

235
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:08,739
Very great artists. They came to Sahaja Yoga

236
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:11,539
and they dropped their habits.

237
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:14,339
They dropped them completely.

238
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:17,539
They were amazed. Next day they dropped it.

239
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:20,139
Because once you get the test

240
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:27,939
of this great understanding that you are the Spirit,

241
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:32,099
you just become so powerful that nothing can overpower you.

242
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:35,499
It has happened with many.

243
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:38,739
Now only thing is that,

244
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:43,058
what is the use, people ask Me, of becoming.

245
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:49,819
The becoming is actually, is the epitome of your evolution.

246
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,539
You have to do it. You cannot avoid it. If not today, tomorrow.

247
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:57,139
If you don’t accept it,

248
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:00,859
then you'll have to face the consequences.

249
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,979
But you have to become the Spirit.

250
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:07,539
The another very great thing it happens,

251
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:12,058
that the light that you have, gives light to others.

252
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:14,939
You can enlighten their lights.

253
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:17,219
Their candles are not yet ready,

254
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:20,058
then you know how to put them right.

255
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:23,459
You can enlighten their lights with your light,

256
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:27,058
without obliging them.

257
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:29,058
Like the sun shines.

258
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,259
It doesn’t say "I’m shinning, I’m doing all this,

259
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:36,299
I’m creating chlorophyll". It doesn’t. It just shines.

260
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:40,099
But we can say that it doesn’t do any work,

261
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:43,259
or we say he does non-work, a-karma.

262
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:46,699
In the same way it starts flowing through your being,

263
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:48,499
just working out.

264
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:53,339
And anybody says, "Mother, I am thankful", I’m surprised.

265
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:57,058
Because if you are a part and parcel of My being,

266
00:15:57,219 --> 00:16:02,939
if this is my finger, if I try to soothe My finger,

267
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:05,459
is not going to thank Me.

268
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:08,539
In the same way, there is not the other left,

269
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:12,899
you just start feeling another person upon your fingertips.

270
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:17,058
That means you become again collectively conscious,

271
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:22,459
and later on as you grow you become cosmic conscious.

272
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:27,899
That means that you know how to handle even the elements.

273
00:16:28,058 --> 00:16:31,379
But first you have to become collectively conscious.

274
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:33,979
When you become collectively conscious,

275
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:38,058
suddenly a tremendous compassion and love starts growing in you.

276
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,939
You feel so nourished yourself that you want to give.

277
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:45,059
You have so much that the charity just

278
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:47,299
makes you feel that you should give.

279
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:49,939
And when this charity starts flowing,

280
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:53,219
then you are amazed how it works.

281
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:56,819
We invite people to our house to create good relationships.

282
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:00,659
We give them food, we give them this, try to make good relationship.

283
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:03,899
Here the relationship is spontaneous.

284
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,979
You don’t have to say about it, it just exists.

285
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,979
You feel it that is there.

286
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:12,379
I’ll give you an example of a girl who went to Sicily

287
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:14,059
and she was feeling very lonely she said

288
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:16,699
"now what am I to talk to these people, you see,

289
00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:19,259
there is nobody here who is a realized soul".

290
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:21,099
She was feeling very lonely.

291
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,259
Suddenly she felt some vibrations around her.

292
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,259
She turn around and she saw another lady sitting there.

293
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:32,499
She said, “Are you the child of Mother?"

294
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:36,219
She just got up and grasped her, she said “Yes, I am".

295
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,219
"I could feel your vibration, you could feel mine"

296
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,939
And just they understood each other,

297
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:44,819
that they were, they had never met before,

298
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:46,219
their language is very different,

299
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:47,979
they were from two different countries,

300
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:49,939
they had nothing to do with each other.

301
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:52,179
But the love and understanding, that they had,

302
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:54,899
that all these identifications drop off,

303
00:17:55,058 --> 00:17:56,499
that you are an Italian,

304
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:59,099
or you are an Indian, or you are an American

305
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:00,899
you become a human being,

306
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:04,779
and a super human being who can feel others.

307
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:08,139
This knowledge is not new.

308
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:11,099
It was a secret knowledge for some time.

309
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:16,459
In the sixth century in our country, a great incarnation came

310
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:20,339
as Adi Shankaracharya and he talked about it openly.

311
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:24,058
And after that also, we had many poets who talked about it.

312
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:26,779
Hundred years back, William Blake came in.

313
00:18:26,979 --> 00:18:30,939
And he said all about it, so clearly, he's such a seer,

314
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:33,859
that he beats all the sears, everywhere.

315
00:18:34,058 --> 00:18:36,179
The amount of precision he has used,

316
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:37,939
because perhaps he felt

317
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:42,419
that if Western mind has to understand, they need precision.

318
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:47,419
Even My house he has described, exact place he has described.

319
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:49,979
Even what Sahaja Yogis will be doing,

320
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:53,299
where our ashram will be in London, what places I’ll be visiting,

321
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,779
I mean to such a detailed thing.

322
00:18:55,979 --> 00:18:59,019
And surprisingly, we discovered all these

323
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,939
after we have been to that place, after we have done it.

324
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,539
Like in London, we had our ashram,

325
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:07,939
and it was a very dilapidated house, bombed.

326
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:12,859
That he has written down. It will be a house, ruined house,

327
00:19:13,058 --> 00:19:15,539
because people didn’t have so much money.

328
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:19,179
So, and then I laid the foundation.

329
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,058
And he said "the foundation will be laid in Lambert,

330
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:23,219
come to Lambert.

331
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:26,499
Her sinews vibrated. He used the word "Her" all the time.

332
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,779
And the clear cut picture he has given.

333
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:33,139
But people called him crazy, that he is a psychological case.

334
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:37,499
Because they don’t have that super consciousness to understand.

335
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:41,379
But if you ask any Sahaja Yogi, he understands him very well.

336
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:46,058
So even only 100 years back, there was someone who talked about Me.

337
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:49,859
I would say 70 years back, somebody talked about Me, in India.

338
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:54,099
But people at 14 000 years back, have also talked about Sahaja Yoga.

339
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:56,859
So you can imagine that it is not

340
00:19:57,058 --> 00:19:59,939
that today I've just started coming out of the blue,

341
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,059
and some sort of a neo business has started.

342
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:05,539
It`s a traditional growth,

343
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:07,819
in a very traditional way,

344
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:13,058
respecting all the establishments, not to demolish anything.

345
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:17,939
But whatever is not correct, drops out by itself.

346
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:21,899
All that is useless drops out by itself.

347
00:20:22,058 --> 00:20:26,699
In the living process, even a flower has to drop out its [chalis]

348
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:28,539
if it has to become the fruit.

349
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:33,419
In the same way everything works out so naturally, the way it grows,

350
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:40,058
that you are amazed that at the end of it you remain pure Spirit.

351
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:44,499
Your eyes become innocent. There is no lust and greed in it.

352
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:48,379
What Christ has said, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes",

353
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,779
that innocence is awakened within you

354
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:54,019
and you just become, become innocent.

355
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:57,059
Becoming innocent is not possible otherwise,

356
00:20:57,259 --> 00:20:59,179
but you just become innocent.

357
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:01,139
You become really childlike.

358
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:04,339
Your whole attitude towards life becomes childlike.

359
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:07,939
Now some people may say that, "When people become like that, Mother,

360
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,058
then what happens to our business?"

361
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:12,859
There was a girl in San Francisco,

362
00:21:13,058 --> 00:21:16,099
an Indian girl who had married another Indian.

363
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:19,859
And they were having a shop. And she said:"After realization Mother,

364
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:24,779
I forgot about counting this, that, I was very meticulous.

365
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,939
But I never made any profits."

366
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:29,459
But now I’m told that they have made so many profits,

367
00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:33,979
they are no more there, that they have 14 stores all over New York.

368
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:40,058
So how things [help] you and work it out when you leave it to God,

369
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:45,299
because He is thousand fold more efficient.

370
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:49,058
I mean He is absolutely, we cannot compare Him to ourselves,

371
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:51,819
because He is perfect.

372
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:56,339
Everything is perfect, but you must enter into His Kingdom.

373
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:01,179
If i don’t come to America, how will I know how Americans operate?

374
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:04,179
When I have come here, then only I’ve come to know.

375
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:10,939
But if you see God's realm is such, that when you enter it,

376
00:22:11,058 --> 00:22:14,259
you feel you are looked after every moment.

377
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:17,099
How He guides you, how He watches you,

378
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:21,379
in the smallest way and in the biggest way, it's most surprising.

379
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,058
It's not easy to understand His ways.

380
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,659
One of the examples, I don’t know, if Warren has told you.

381
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:31,058
Did you tell them about the Bedford example, Warren? No.

382
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:32,939
I must tell you this one, so that you’ll

383
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:34,859
understand His ways are so great.

384
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:40,099
I was in Bedford one night, and we had about 600 people there.

385
00:22:40,379 --> 00:22:43,459
I was speaking to them, about 7 o’clock I was there,

386
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:45,019
till about 10 o’clock.

387
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:51,939
At 8 o’clock about 10-15 miles away, one boy fell down in a ditch,

388
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:55,219
in a sense that there was a bridge and he fell down very low,

389
00:22:55,419 --> 00:22:57,739
with his motorcycle.

390
00:22:58,259 --> 00:22:59,979
And when they sent for the ambulance,

391
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:01,499
he just walked up and came out,

392
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:04,419
so they were quite surprised that how could he come.

393
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:07,939
So they took him in the ambulance to the hospital,

394
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:09,739
and the police also came.

395
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:13,058
Then he told them, that "A lady, Indian lady

396
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:15,939
came in a white car - I have a white car -

397
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:21,019
and She came down and She healed me completely".

398
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:23,859
But She said that, "At the base of the spine there is still problem,

399
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:25,419
you come and see me at my house."

400
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:28,179
And She went away. But the people who were there, they said,

401
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:31,139
"We saw no car, we saw no lady coming here.

402
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:33,059
What is he talking about?"

403
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,939
So they noted down everything and next day,

404
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,099
because he was completely all right, they were surprised,

405
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:40,899
falling from that distance, nothing had happened.

406
00:23:41,058 --> 00:23:43,979
He saw My photograph in the newspaper,

407
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:46,939
and then he said, "This is the lady".

408
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:50,339
And that was at 8 o’clock when I was speaking to so many people.

409
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:52,939
So they were quite surprised when he went and told the police,

410
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:57,299
and he told the hospital people, that they informed the newspaper.

411
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,939
And newspaper people wrote to us

412
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:04,979
and one of our Sahaja Yogis, answered back,

413
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:07,058
and the whole thing was in the newspaper.

414
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:08,939
And they were quite amazed at it.

415
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:12,779
Now how this has happened. You may say how can this happen, Mother?

416
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:15,859
It can happen, because as you have got television,

417
00:24:16,058 --> 00:24:20,139
God has tremendous organization of television.

418
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:23,739
He has all telecommunication, everything.

419
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:27,179
Don’t think that you can only produce these, these are dead.

420
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:28,979
These are good for nothing.

421
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:33,499
His working is so great that tat-kshane, at that moment.

422
00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:38,058
As soon as you see, as soon as you speak

423
00:24:38,219 --> 00:24:40,939
as soon as you desire, it works out.

424
00:24:41,058 --> 00:24:44,139
Even if somebody just desires,

425
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:49,099
and he is a man looked after God,

426
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:53,819
even he may not be a realized soul. He is helped in such a way.

427
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:56,379
Now then after that they described all such

428
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:59,019
happenings that took place in India, and everywhere.

429
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:00,779
But what I am trying to say,

430
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:04,499
that we are so much proud of what our achievements are.

431
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:10,058
These achievements are nothing, compared to what God has for you.

432
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:12,979
In His realm once you enter,

433
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:15,499
actually you yourself become so beautiful,

434
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:22,459
you yourself become such a dynamic, beautiful, silent flame of love,

435
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:28,019
that you are not bothered at all as to what is happening around,

436
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:31,058
what is going wrong, you don’t get upset with it.

437
00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:35,299
You are silently watching all this joke, all this drama,

438
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:38,299
hoping that one day, the rest of the world

439
00:25:38,499 --> 00:25:42,179
will also become realized,

440
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:46,499
and the rest of the world will also enjoy the blessings of God.

441
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:51,139
This is what is desired by every Sahaja Yogi,

442
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:53,979
and that's why they forced Me to come to America,

443
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:56,979
that I should come and speak to people here.

444
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:00,219
So we must understand what are the barriers within us,

445
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:02,099
not to understand Divinity

446
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:04,179
Why we cannot understand Divinity?

447
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:06,859
First of all we have had no education.

448
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:11,139
Whatever education we have had was about the tree that is outside.

449
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:14,939
But we have no education about the roots, doesn’t matter.

450
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:17,339
To go to the roots, you have to become subtle.

451
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:20,058
When you get Realization you enter into the roots,

452
00:26:20,219 --> 00:26:22,139
and the knowledge becomes yours in no time.

453
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:25,019
You don’t need much time to know about it,

454
00:26:25,139 --> 00:26:28,419
because you become the light and through that light you can see.

455
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:32,179
Like you must have seen these people who work in the mines, you see,

456
00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:33,939
they have a light placed here

457
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:35,459
and through that they can see everything.

458
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:38,499
In the same way you become the light, you don’t see the light,

459
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:43,058
You become the light, and in that light you see everything.

460
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:47,299
Now, when this happens to you,

461
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:51,058
your attention, as I told you, becomes collective.

462
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:56,139
Your attention starts feel another personality,

463
00:26:56,379 --> 00:27:00,939
another person, another person’s, another people,

464
00:27:01,058 --> 00:27:03,899
and you start understanding what the problem is.

465
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:06,899
And you can help them,

466
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:13,499
by just doing some sort of a blessing, as you say,

467
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:15,259
and you can work it out.

468
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:17,939
But there are people who are unwise.

469
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:19,859
In this world, there are people who are stupid.

470
00:27:20,058 --> 00:27:21,299
They need not be educated.

471
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:24,859
Educated people also can be very unwise people.

472
00:27:25,058 --> 00:27:30,259
They need not be very intelligent,

473
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:32,139
or they may be intelligent,

474
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:35,299
but wisdom is an innate quality in a person.

475
00:27:35,499 --> 00:27:37,059
If they are wise enough,

476
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:40,058
they know how to handle the situation, to understand themselves

477
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:42,779
and they settle down in Sahaja Yoga in no time.

478
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:46,139
But those who are not so wise, take time.

479
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:51,099
So one has to understand that we have to have perseverance about it

480
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:54,779
we have to settle down into it, absolutely master it,

481
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:57,339
because you become the master.

482
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,859
That’s the point is, you become the master of yourself

483
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:02,899
you don`t need any guru. You become the master.

484
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:07,019
As I will tell you, the left and the right, is here.

485
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:11,939
We can compare it to the brake and the accelerator of a car.

486
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,539
Left side is the brake

487
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:15,299
- Gregoire later you do it, because you see,

488
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:17,379
people have attention very much confused.

489
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:19,499
If you get up immediately their eyes go there.

490
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,819
We should keep, you see, he is just taking a photograph.

491
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:24,499
We have seen so many people in this world.

492
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:28,058
For a change, keep your attention little concentrated.

493
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:32,139
But it will happen.

494
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:34,779
It will happen, once you get your Realization,

495
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:38,058
your attention will be very, very nicely placed.

496
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:43,819
Now, when you people know that this has happened to you,

497
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:48,339
and when you become the master,

498
00:28:49,058 --> 00:28:53,259
you know the brake and the accelerator in you.

499
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:57,219
But still, actually you are not the master,

500
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,058
you are still the driver.

501
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:02,379
And when you are a driver, you automatically do it driving,

502
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:05,299
but still one should not say that you are a driver.

503
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:07,979
You know the balancing of it, you know how to maneuver it,

504
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:10,058
how to act.

505
00:29:11,058 --> 00:29:16,058
But then, what happens? To become the master, what do you do?

506
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:18,539
This Realization takes place.

507
00:29:18,939 --> 00:29:22,379
Then you become the master, and you see the driver,

508
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:26,419
you see the accelerator, and you see the brake in yourself.

509
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:29,139
And you just enjoy like a master.

510
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:32,979
When you become the master, you cannot be slave of anything.

511
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:35,539
No more slavery, the real freedom lies

512
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:37,979
in becoming the master of yourself.

513
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:40,939
No use mastering others, just master yourself.

514
00:29:41,058 --> 00:29:43,939
But that mastering cannot be done by lecturing

515
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:46,939
or by brainwashing, or by talking to you,

516
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:49,019
but it's a happening that has to take place.

517
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:53,019
The Kundalini has to rise and has to give you Realization.

518
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:59,058
This, unless and until this happens we should not say that we know.

519
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:04,779
Know, knowledge is not, when we are not one with the Divine.

520
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:10,259
It’s like a machine or you can say telephone not connected.

521
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:14,299
We have to get our connection first, establish the connection,

522
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:17,859
and then we become the knower.

523
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:21,819
And the knowledge becomes a part and parcel of you.

524
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:24,659
But this cannot happen to stupid people.

525
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,499
It’s not meant for stupid at all,

526
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:28,819
neither for the cowardly.

527
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:32,058
It is meant for people who are courageous,

528
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:35,058
who are people of wisdom,

529
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:39,939
who are not given to nonsensical things easily.

530
00:30:40,058 --> 00:30:43,259
That`s why in Sahaja Yoga there are two forces working all the time.

531
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:45,539
You may get your Realization today here,

532
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:49,058
but I won’t say that you’ll sustain it. I won’t guarantee that.

533
00:30:49,219 --> 00:30:51,058
The reason is, we have two forces,

534
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:54,058
one is centripetal and another is centrifugal.

535
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,259
By one force you are attracted towards it,

536
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:58,259
by another force you are thrown out.

537
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:00,259
Because you have come out of matter.

538
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,459
And the matter tries to drag you down.

539
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:04,058
You have to master it,

540
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:07,859
in such a way that the Spirit sits on the top of the matter.

541
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:10,058
And the matter doesn’t dominate you anymore.

542
00:31:10,219 --> 00:31:15,139
And for that you have to meditate, and you will be in meditation.

543
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:18,539
It's simple thing to be done, there’s nothing difficult.

544
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:20,939
Sahaja Yoga is the simplest method.

545
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:26,299
Sahaja also means, it means also a simple, easy.

546
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:28,979
But "saha-ja", saha means with,

547
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:30,979
"ja" means born, is born with you.

548
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:34,019
But today this is called in India as Maha Yoga.

549
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:36,939
Because before this, all the Realizations

550
00:31:37,058 --> 00:31:39,099
took place of course through Sahaj only,

551
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,058
by Kundalini awakening. There is no other way.

552
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:45,459
Only Kundalini awakening is the way you get your Realization.

553
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:47,739
Like some people said, there must be some another way.

554
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:51,058
There is none. Because like a seed has to sprout

555
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:54,939
through the primule only, in the same way, in your case,

556
00:31:55,058 --> 00:31:58,379
in human beings, the Kundalini has to rise to give you Realization.

557
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:00,899
There’s no other way, but this.

558
00:32:01,058 --> 00:32:03,939
It is called as Sahaja method, means spontaneous method.

559
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:05,939
But today it is called as Maha Yoga,

560
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:09,379
because you`ll find thousands of people get Realization.

561
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,979
People who have been with Me in the villages of India,

562
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:15,499
have seen 6000, 8000 people gathered.

563
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,939
I mean in New York we have so many people, see how many have come.

564
00:32:19,058 --> 00:32:21,939
But if you go to a village, one village in India,

565
00:32:22,058 --> 00:32:25,179
you’ll be surprised, people will be pouring on their bullock carts,

566
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,699
" There, Mataji has come".

567
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:29,979
Because they know, and in that atmosphere, you see,

568
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:33,379
the fragrance of this good news spreads so fast,

569
00:32:33,979 --> 00:32:37,779
spreads so fast, because that’s the atmosphere for that.

570
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:40,499
But where there is so much of mental activity,

571
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:42,058
nothing can penetrate.

572
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:47,179
They cannot see, they have no sensitivity to visualize

573
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:50,058
what is good for them and what is not.

574
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:53,058
So the last chakra is of the 7-th,

575
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:55,819
all the 7 chakras are in the last chakra.

576
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:58,299
And that's how you get complete integrated.

577
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:00,939
Your emotional being, your mental being,

578
00:33:01,058 --> 00:33:04,499
your physical being, your spiritual being completely integrated.

579
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:07,939
You go beyond time. You are not bothered about time at all.

580
00:33:08,058 --> 00:33:09,939
If you say "Mother, when will get Realization?

581
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:13,058
I say "Just now". That's the point is.

582
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:17,419
But if you don’t get it, all right. If you get it, just now.

583
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:19,979
This Kundalini rises in a split of a second,

584
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:22,099
like a jet it goes out of your head.

585
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:25,139
But with so many people it just struggles [for days].

586
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:28,459
She is there at the base just trying to come up.

587
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:30,058
It's very difficult sometimes.

588
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:32,739
I've seen some Kundalinis in such a bad shape

589
00:33:32,939 --> 00:33:35,939
that it horrifies Me. What we have done to ourselves?

590
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:39,459
By this kind of a tomfoolery, "What is wrong? What is wrong?",

591
00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:41,499
going into this and going into that,

592
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:44,819
we have really ruined our chances of our evolution.

593
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:46,939
And then you say you are seeking.

594
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:50,899
How to help people? You have already weakened yourself so much.

595
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:52,499
It takes time.

596
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:55,139
It’s one of my concerns, that so many saints

597
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:58,219
are born in this country, are born in the West.

598
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:01,899
But where are they lost, what has happened to them?

599
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:05,058
Why do they take so much time to take to reality?

600
00:34:05,219 --> 00:34:07,419
They are driven to any fake guru

601
00:34:07,699 --> 00:34:09,779
to any fake person who is making money,

602
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:12,058
who has got Rolls Royces, this, that.

603
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:15,179
Why should it impress you so much, I can’t understand.

604
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:18,058
Like a newspaper I went to, and they said,

605
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,859
"How many Rolls Royce She has got?"

606
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,139
They said, "She has no Rolls Royces".

607
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:23,859
Then they said, "We are not interested". Imagine!

608
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:29,179
Such a thing happening in your country is absolutely absurd,

609
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:33,219
that such a thing should happen to people who are intelligent,

610
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:35,058
that God cannot be purchased,

611
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:39,739
He cannot be paid in Rolls Royces and all these material things.

612
00:34:39,979 --> 00:34:43,019
They are nothing to Him, they are not equal to the dust of His feet.

613
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,179
And what is there to give up? Some people talk

614
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:47,339
that you must give up this and give up that.

615
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:50,019
When you are not holding to anything, what is there to give up?

616
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,499
All these nonsensical ideas,

617
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:53,659
that you give up this for God, give up that.

618
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:57,299
God doesn't want all these nonsensical things you give to yourself.

619
00:34:57,499 --> 00:35:00,019
But what happens, you get out of it.

620
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:04,339
A thought rises and falls off. Another thought rises and falls off.

621
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:07,859
When you are in the thought, you are materialistic

622
00:35:08,058 --> 00:35:12,819
you are mentally thinking and all those things happening.

623
00:35:13,058 --> 00:35:15,859
But in the center is a little space,

624
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:18,058
which is called in Sanskrit as vilamba.

625
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:20,379
When you rise above that,

626
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:22,779
then neither you are in the future nor in the past.

627
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:24,699
You are above time.

628
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:26,058
You are absolutely detached.

629
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:28,379
You start seeing the whole thing as a joke.

630
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:31,058
And then you become a real dynamic person.

631
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:35,219
And you create things which are superb and eternal.

632
00:35:35,419 --> 00:35:37,859
Like I would say Mozart was a realized soul.

633
00:35:38,058 --> 00:35:40,179
Michelangelo was another realized soul.

634
00:35:40,379 --> 00:35:43,499
They created all those things because they were realized souls.

635
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:47,219
They could go out and see for themselves what’s happening.

636
00:35:47,419 --> 00:35:50,058
All the great geniuses who have lust,

637
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:53,499
all useless, vulgar, cheap type have fallen.

638
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,979
They do not stand, they cannot stand the test of time.

639
00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:00,459
They have all gone out. See, Christ came 2000 years back.

640
00:36:00,979 --> 00:36:05,139
How many artists from 2000 years back, have stood the test of time?

641
00:36:06,058 --> 00:36:08,339
He is still there. He is still there.

642
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:11,099
Why? Because He was genuine.

643
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:13,939
He was real. What He said was the truth.

644
00:36:14,058 --> 00:36:15,939
That's why He is still there.

645
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:18,219
And that's what we have to understand that once you become

646
00:36:18,419 --> 00:36:20,299
that genuine Self, that is you,

647
00:36:20,739 --> 00:36:23,219
the beauty, the glory within you.

648
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:25,699
Then you don’t have to worry, you never perish,

649
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:28,179
you get into the eternal life.

650
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:32,139
Now there is no end to my talking. I’ve been talking

651
00:36:32,379 --> 00:36:36,459
for now, at least one and a half month continuously.

652
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:40,939
Apart from that I was 21 days out in tour in Europe,

653
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:44,219
just 2 days in between, and again I came here.

654
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:47,939
I have given so many lectures, that in London if you go,

655
00:36:48,058 --> 00:36:49,659
you’ll find thousands of them.

656
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:53,058
I have spoken individually about ego, superego,

657
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:56,058
all these things, about chakras, all the details about it,

658
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:59,339
and I’ve gone through all the details.

659
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:03,979
But in these 3 days whatever I could cover, I've tried to tell you,

660
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:06,099
and I also allowed you to ask questions.

661
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:09,419
But yesterday as you know, some stupid people came in

662
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:11,539
and tried to disturb Me. Now look at them.

663
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:13,739
There is, I can’t understand that,

664
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:16,539
because their daughter telephoned to Me, today also,

665
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:19,779
that her father has gone to work, he is not there.

666
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:21,739
So they are cheating their daughter,

667
00:37:21,979 --> 00:37:23,699
coming and disturbing others.

668
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:25,779
Abd why are they doing this?

669
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:27,939
Why don’t they understand their child?

670
00:37:28,058 --> 00:37:30,339
They don’t believe in God, but the child believes in God,

671
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,219
let the child, because that child is free now, in this country.

672
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,859
You should allow the child to know about the God.

673
00:37:37,058 --> 00:37:39,979
Even supposing she does wrong, I say even if it is a cult,

674
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:43,139
how can you stop? But they can’t see the point.

675
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:47,058
That the point is, she is a different category of a person.

676
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:50,339
She’s a person who’s a seeker. She has to seek.

677
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:53,299
Even if she is making mistakes, they cannot stop it,

678
00:37:53,499 --> 00:37:55,058
that is her nature.

679
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:57,699
She will never stop, till she has found it.

680
00:37:57,939 --> 00:37:59,859
Because that is a special category.

681
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:03,058
She is not a mundane type of materialistic personality

682
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:05,058
who can take just to anything.

683
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:07,859
She is a person who is a seeker. I know they have done mistakes,

684
00:38:08,058 --> 00:38:09,659
they have gone to cults, they have ruined themselves,

685
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:10,939
whatever it is.

686
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:13,099
But she’ll be born again and again and will be seeking.

687
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:17,859
Because she is a person who is a seeker,

688
00:38:18,058 --> 00:38:20,058
is a very special category,

689
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:24,219
and that say, special category is at the epitome of evolution.

690
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:27,419
The mundane type of vulgar, loafer type of people,

691
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:29,699
are not meant for God.

692
00:38:29,939 --> 00:38:32,939
He is not bothered about that, just a waste product.

693
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:37,099
The people who are seekers are only under His grace

694
00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:39,499
and He is only worried and concerned about them

695
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:41,139
and not about the people

696
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:44,019
who maybe are occupying very big positions or anything,

697
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:46,539
I mean My husband is in the, you know,

698
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:48,219
he is a secretary general and all that,

699
00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:49,859
but i never went to the UN, at all.

700
00:38:50,058 --> 00:38:52,058
I said, "I have nothing to do with your", It has nothing to do,

701
00:38:52,259 --> 00:38:54,819
because this is a special category of people.

702
00:38:55,058 --> 00:38:58,058
They will meet Me here, that`s what it is.

703
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:04,219
One has to understand that is not what family you come from,

704
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:09,058
what nationality you come from, or what color you have,

705
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:11,058
what education you have had,

706
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:14,739
but what kind of a being, the inner being you have, is important.

707
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:18,219
If that is the seeker, then you get your Realization.

708
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:21,219
May God bless you all.

709
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:26,019
Now can you ask Me some questions?

710
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:30,019
If you want to, but don’t try to dominate Me, that’s not good.

711
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:32,219
Yesterday they misbehaved to such an extent.

712
00:39:32,419 --> 00:39:34,819
What happened? Is all right?

713
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:36,219
SM: She has come?
SY: Yes she is here.

714
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:38,299
She's come, she told the police.

715
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:41,179
SY: She's just sitting there quietly with her mother.

716
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,058
SM: Where?

717
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:47,059
SY: Any questions? Yes.

718
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:52,259
Q: Shri Mataji, when you spoke

719
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:54,299
SM: Yes he is asking it.

720
00:39:54,499 --> 00:39:56,859
Q: all about the people from Your country

721
00:39:57,058 --> 00:39:59,499
who came to our country the United States,

722
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:04,979
as teachers who, who are [unclear] false teachers

723
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:09,059
and not very [unclear] and not realized, not realized.

724
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:14,019
Are there any in Your country or in our country as teachers

725
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:18,019
who do respect and [unclear] are realized people?

726
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:22,058
SY: You’ve spoken of teachers and gurus who come from your country,

727
00:40:22,179 --> 00:40:25,779
who are either false teachers or not realized.

728
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:29,659
Are there [unclear] are realized?

729
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:32,939
SM: There are many, but they don`t want to come. Let`s sit.

730
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:34,539
Q: I mean are there any...

731
00:40:34,819 --> 00:40:36,699
Agree that, I understand.

732
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:39,419
There are many real ones also in India.

733
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:42,059
They know about My work.

734
00:40:49,058 --> 00:40:51,739
There are many who are real gurus in India.

735
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:55,459
And they know about My work. They respect Me very much.

736
00:40:56,058 --> 00:40:58,459
And I asked one of them,

737
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:01,939
who was [real] one, to come to United States,

738
00:41:02,058 --> 00:41:04,819
because I could not come, it's dangerous.

739
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:06,939
He just refused first of all.

740
00:41:07,058 --> 00:41:10,379
But he [unclear] and within 3 days he ran away.

741
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:12,059
He said "They'll never understand me".

742
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:16,058
Mother they want me to wear some horns. He would not stay.

743
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:19,058
So they are. There are many who are real gurus,

744
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:23,979
but they are hiding themselves in the hills and vales.

745
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:27,059
And they are very strict people, I'm afraid they are not [for us].

746
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:30,299
[unclear]

747
00:41:30,899 --> 00:41:33,539
"Because we have worked very hard to become like this

748
00:41:33,819 --> 00:41:37,339
and these people want to take advantage of our achievements

749
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:40,058
[unclear].

750
00:41:40,339 --> 00:41:46,059
There is one called as Narendra Maharaj because [unclear].

751
00:41:46,299 --> 00:41:51,379
They say [unclear] and poor person

752
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:54,139
his legs and hands were broken by other people, you see.

753
00:41:54,339 --> 00:41:56,939
That's what they do [unclear].

754
00:41:57,058 --> 00:41:59,299
Till the person [unclear]

755
00:41:59,499 --> 00:42:03,219
and they always trouble the right people.

756
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:07,379
So I went to see him, because he was telling people,

757
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:09,739
that "Now, Mother has come, so why do you want to [trouble me]?

758
00:42:09,939 --> 00:42:11,459
Go and see Her".

759
00:42:12,058 --> 00:42:14,859
And he told Me that, "If anybody troubles you Mother

760
00:42:15,058 --> 00:42:16,939
send him over to me".

761
00:42:17,299 --> 00:42:19,939
I didn't know he was such a straight man, Myself.

762
00:42:20,058 --> 00:42:22,859
So there was one fellow who was torturing My life,

763
00:42:23,058 --> 00:42:26,058
in the program often he used to come and ask such questions and,

764
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:29,859
very funny type. So I told him, [unclear].

765
00:42:30,058 --> 00:42:33,859
[unclear] to Maharashtra.

766
00:42:34,058 --> 00:42:36,819
He thought, "Oh, Mother [unclear]

767
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:38,459
I went to see him.

768
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:41,219
After one month I saw him, he was sitting like this

769
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:43,939
in the passage, [unclear].

770
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:48,058
And this fellow had put his legs on his neck and was juggling.

771
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:51,379
And people brought him [unclear].

772
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:54,299
The whole thing was horrifing, tears came into My eyes.

773
00:42:54,499 --> 00:42:56,419
I said, "What's the matter?"

774
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:59,699
He said, "Mother, I must tell you what has happened to me,

775
00:42:59,899 --> 00:43:00,939
[unclear]

776
00:43:01,058 --> 00:43:03,139
"What happened?" "I went to that guru".

777
00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:04,779
"Then why? What happened?

778
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:06,459
He said, "I just told [unclear] things against You".

779
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:07,939
I said, "What did you tell him?"

780
00:43:08,058 --> 00:43:10,058
I just said that, "She gives Realization

781
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:12,779
to every Tom, Dick and Harry and She should be careful

782
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:14,859
[unclear] all kinds of things like this.

783
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:16,939
He said, "You are wiser than Mother, are you?"

784
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:19,499
And that's all he said and I slept off.

785
00:43:19,899 --> 00:43:22,379
In the night he [unclear] a tiger

786
00:43:22,779 --> 00:43:24,699
so the tiger pushed me into a ditch

787
00:43:24,899 --> 00:43:27,259
and then I fell down, about 3 feet down.

788
00:43:27,459 --> 00:43:29,339
and I broke my legs.

789
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:33,059
And then he locks up

790
00:43:33,259 --> 00:43:36,058
[unclear]

791
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:39,299
about three inch [unclear]. He said, "Now, eat it".

792
00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:42,059
I was there for 5-6 days like that.

793
00:43:42,259 --> 00:43:44,058
Then he sent somebody to pick me up,

794
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:45,899
they wanted to [unclear], treat me

795
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:50,099
and then they said, "Now see our guru". So they brought him there.

796
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:53,419
He said, "Now you take his legs and put them in your neck

797
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:57,058
and [unclear] to your Mother. She is your guru, not me".

798
00:43:57,779 --> 00:43:59,139
I was a really shocked at it.

799
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:02,099
Another fellow, a doctor used [to think] no end of himself,

800
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:03,739
and he tried to argue much with Me

801
00:44:03,939 --> 00:44:06,699
so I said, "You go and see [unclear]".

802
00:44:06,899 --> 00:44:08,899
So he went to see him.

803
00:44:09,058 --> 00:44:10,699
And when he went to see him, you see,

804
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:14,219
he told him some sort of a thing, I don't know what he told him,

805
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:17,259
but when he came back I saw he was looking thin.

806
00:44:17,459 --> 00:44:20,939
So I said, "Why [unclear]. What has happened?

807
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:23,299
He said, "Every day I had to carry seven miles,

808
00:44:23,499 --> 00:44:28,058
two buckets of water". [unclear]

809
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:29,699
I said, "But for what?"

810
00:44:29,899 --> 00:44:33,019
He said "That's what You said [unclear] do like this.

811
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:35,939
So I asked this man, I said, "Why did you do like that?"

812
00:44:36,058 --> 00:44:39,659
He said, "For a donkey, he must be [brought] this way.

813
00:44:39,859 --> 00:44:41,019
You are too kind.

814
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:43,058
They don't know how much we have [worked].

815
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:45,859
They are extremely strict people, I've seen that.

816
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,099
They beat their disciples sometimes.

817
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:53,019
Another one I've met, was called as [unclear], something like that.

818
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:54,859
And he lived [unclear].

819
00:44:55,058 --> 00:44:58,058
And he came to see Me in another place called Ambarnath,

820
00:44:58,219 --> 00:45:01,499
where his disciple was living [unclear].

821
00:45:03,419 --> 00:45:06,019
And this disciple took Me to see him there,

822
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:08,099
in the ashram that he had.

823
00:45:08,379 --> 00:45:13,819
And he, as soon as we entered, you see

824
00:45:14,058 --> 00:45:15,939
[unclear] his disciple told me,

825
00:45:16,058 --> 00:45:19,099
"Mataji, my guru [unclear], very badly".

826
00:45:19,499 --> 00:45:21,779
So I went there, he touched My Feet and all.

827
00:45:21,979 --> 00:45:23,699
I said, "Why did you beat him?

828
00:45:23,899 --> 00:45:29,379
He said, you know when going [unclear] he was smoking.

829
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:30,939
So I hit him hard".

830
00:45:31,058 --> 00:45:32,939
Then I said, "Really you should not have done it.

831
00:45:33,058 --> 00:45:35,539
If you give him Realization then he won't.

832
00:45:35,939 --> 00:45:37,379
But his Agnya chakra is catching.

833
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:39,979
And the Agnya chakra is catching, so poor fellow, you see,

834
00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:42,379
he does not know to get rid of it, so he's smoking

835
00:45:42,779 --> 00:45:44,499
He said, "Who cleared my Agnya chakra?

836
00:45:44,899 --> 00:45:47,059
I cleared mine for years together, I've worked hard.

837
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:48,739
Why should I [unclear]?

838
00:45:48,939 --> 00:45:50,379
I said, "This is five minutes job".

839
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,058
"For You this is five minutes job".

840
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:54,019
I cleared his Agnya chakra.

841
00:45:54,179 --> 00:45:57,899
Then on My way back, he told Me that he raised him [unclear],

842
00:45:58,058 --> 00:46:00,539
hang him on a well before he [unclear].

843
00:46:00,939 --> 00:46:04,859
[unclear] they take you to tests to much, they do this,

844
00:46:05,058 --> 00:46:07,899
but there are many people like that.

845
00:46:08,058 --> 00:46:10,058
Another one who was here [unclear]

846
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:14,059
[unclear] Realization and started making money and I didn`t know.

847
00:46:14,259 --> 00:46:16,939
He came back and he told me that he's doing very well.

848
00:46:17,058 --> 00:46:18,939
But the vibrations were very bad and we discovered

849
00:46:19,059 --> 00:46:21,939
that he was making money out of his vibrations.

850
00:46:22,058 --> 00:46:25,299
And I scolded him, I said, "Why did you make money like this?"

851
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:26,939
He said, "Should I become poor man?"

852
00:46:27,058 --> 00:46:29,459
I said, "Whatever you were doing, as if you were a teacher...

853
00:46:29,859 --> 00:46:31,219
Why don't you become a teacher?

854
00:46:31,419 --> 00:46:32,899
Why do you want to sell vibrations?

855
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:35,059
Did I give you vibrations for money?"

856
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,419
He said, "No, but I have to do it". He shouted at Me.

857
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:39,939
But then he went away [unclear].

858
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:42,299
And he went to see him [in Calcutta], this fellow.

859
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,099
And the description is like this,

860
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:46,859
because he came back and [unclear].

861
00:46:47,058 --> 00:46:48,939
He said that, "As soon as I went there he started,

862
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:51,859
and the guru started throwing big stones at me.

863
00:46:52,058 --> 00:46:53,499
So [unclear] back to the station

864
00:46:53,899 --> 00:46:58,219
and the people from there came and told Me that

865
00:46:58,499 --> 00:47:00,099
"The guru is very angry with you

866
00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:01,419
because you went to Mother and misbehave,

867
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:03,899
and he`s not going to talk to you.

868
00:47:04,058 --> 00:47:06,219
So he was quite surprised. He said, "All right,

869
00:47:06,419 --> 00:47:07,859
I've never seen this guru, please ask him."

870
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:11,419
Then three times he went there and the guru was beating him,

871
00:47:12,058 --> 00:47:14,179
throwing stones at him.

872
00:47:14,379 --> 00:47:17,939
But this fellow, you see, I think human beings have this habit,

873
00:47:18,058 --> 00:47:21,058
the more you try to discard them, the more they'll stick to you.

874
00:47:21,219 --> 00:47:22,699
Otherwise if you're kind to them,

875
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:24,739
they don't understand kindness perhaps.

876
00:47:24,979 --> 00:47:28,939
Then forth day [unclear]

877
00:47:29,058 --> 00:47:32,979
[unclear]

878
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:36,939
[unclear]

879
00:47:37,058 --> 00:47:40,379
[unclear]

880
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:45,899
But this fellow has been doing such wrong things, even now in a way,

881
00:47:46,058 --> 00:47:48,219
that he cannot come and see Me

882
00:47:48,419 --> 00:47:50,899
because he is making money out of Sahaja Yoga.

883
00:47:51,058 --> 00:47:52,939
He is calling himself as a Sahaja Yogi

884
00:47:53,059 --> 00:47:56,939
and he is curing people and he is trying to befool them.

885
00:47:57,058 --> 00:47:59,339
And surprisingly, he is an Indian but  I can't understand

886
00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:01,779
why he took to such a [gain].

887
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:04,299
In India we have so many Sahaja Yogis, thousands,

888
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:06,299
but nobody does like this.

889
00:48:06,499 --> 00:48:09,058
I don`t know why he is doing like this, really.

890
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:12,979
So this is what it is. There are gurus, many gurus,

891
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:17,899
but they don`t want to have anything to do with others.

892
00:48:18,058 --> 00:48:20,058
They are very [unclear] people.

893
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:24,058
I am [trying], yet I am not given up.

894
00:48:30,058 --> 00:48:36,058
Q: Would excessive fatigue have an effect of your Self Realization,

895
00:48:36,259 --> 00:48:39,459
or impair your powers of discrimination?

896
00:48:41,058 --> 00:48:43,419
Would excessive fatigue

897
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:45,859
impair your discrimination

898
00:48:46,058 --> 00:48:48,299
and have an effect on your Self Realization?

899
00:48:48,499 --> 00:48:51,179
SM: Excessive what? SY: Fatigue, tiredness.

900
00:48:51,379 --> 00:48:52,699
Excessive physical exhaustion.

901
00:48:52,899 --> 00:48:56,179
SM: Excessive fatigue if you have is very simple to get rid of it.

902
00:48:56,379 --> 00:48:59,259
You see what you have to do, when you are having this fatigue,

903
00:48:59,459 --> 00:49:01,859
your right side is exhausted, all right?

904
00:49:02,058 --> 00:49:04,859
When put your left hand towards the photograph,

905
00:49:05,058 --> 00:49:06,899
because in the beginning you have to use My photograph.

906
00:49:07,058 --> 00:49:09,179
Later on you need not, but in the beginning.

907
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:12,779
Even if My photograph is not there, you can put the hand,

908
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:17,058
and raise your left side like this.

909
00:49:17,259 --> 00:49:21,699
Left. Raise the left side to the right. Like this.

910
00:49:21,899 --> 00:49:25,219
And put it here. Even for a heart attack it is very important.

911
00:49:26,058 --> 00:49:29,139
Even if you have heart attacks as hearth is [unclear]

912
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:32,179
you can raise your left side, raise it up

913
00:49:32,379 --> 00:49:34,939
take it out from your head and put it down.

914
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:38,058
The fatigue will go away, you get balanced.

915
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:41,259
But one should not go to extremes in Sahaja Yoga.

916
00:49:41,459 --> 00:49:44,058
You should work to a point then finish off.

917
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:46,979
But once the energy is established,

918
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:50,058
connection is established [unclear].

919
00:49:51,058 --> 00:49:56,299
We are very resistant, quite a lot. Look at Me.

920
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:06,019
Q: I have something that is in away question

921
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:09,299
but it's difficult for me to put it in that form

922
00:50:09,499 --> 00:50:12,179
so I would like just say something that

923
00:50:12,499 --> 00:50:14,819
that might make it so.

924
00:50:16,259 --> 00:50:19,539
I was listening with a friend yesterday,

925
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,979
and listening just some wonderful music,

926
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:27,499
and, and I had, I had some moments

927
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:32,939
of, of real feeling, of real, and some more realization

928
00:50:33,058 --> 00:50:35,939
and sense of the beauty in the world

929
00:50:36,058 --> 00:50:37,459
than I have had in the past.

930
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:40,979
It seems to be something that has been growing and developing

931
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:43,179
with what I hear, what I see,

932
00:50:43,379 --> 00:50:47,819
as I am still quite a beginner on the spiritual path,

933
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:52,259
but I have been on, long enough to feel this.

934
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:57,058
And, and I was about to remark to my friend

935
00:50:57,259 --> 00:51:03,058
that such a beautiful world, and yet it seems that the more

936
00:51:03,219 --> 00:51:08,539
the more that we do in a positive [side] in this world

937
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:13,539
it seems, that there seems to be on the, always on the other extreme

938
00:51:13,939 --> 00:51:20,058
more problems, more, more...

939
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:25,058
things that are threatening, threatening us.

940
00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:30,219
[unclear] and in myself I feel that as I, as I haven't tried

941
00:51:30,419 --> 00:51:34,859
to develop spirituality, I feel that sometimes

942
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:39,379
on one hand I have moments of this type of wonders

943
00:51:39,779 --> 00:51:43,459
and on the other hand more and more feelings of fear.

944
00:51:43,899 --> 00:51:47,139
So in a way, is like an internal fear that I hope

945
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:52,219
that I will survive that exploding

946
00:51:52,419 --> 00:51:56,859
on, on the, without destroying myself in this path,

947
00:51:57,058 --> 00:52:01,459
and in a larger sense I hope that the world will survive,

948
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:06,339
this period of so...SY [unclear]

949
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:14,339
The basic conflict between what we see as a [unclear]

950
00:52:14,539 --> 00:52:16,939
consciousness and the beauty of things,

951
00:52:17,058 --> 00:52:20,179
for example the music he was listening to yesterday

952
00:52:20,379 --> 00:52:23,539
made him closer to [unclear].

953
00:52:23,939 --> 00:52:26,859
But yet on the outside he sees that struggle, that conflict,

954
00:52:27,058 --> 00:52:31,058
that fear and [he things what's the] solution

955
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:32,739
and how the Realization....

956
00:52:32,939 --> 00:52:35,058
SM: You see that is what I say

957
00:52:35,179 --> 00:52:37,659
that unless and until the Realization is established,

958
00:52:37,859 --> 00:52:39,939
you don't become the master of the situation.

959
00:52:40,058 --> 00:52:43,299
Now wone must know that if you see a conflict or anything

960
00:52:43,499 --> 00:52:44,939
you don`t know how to master it.

961
00:52:45,058 --> 00:52:46,259
That is the point is.

962
00:52:46,459 --> 00:52:49,099
But if you somehow get your Realization established,

963
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:51,499
then what happens is that you are out of it.

964
00:52:51,939 --> 00:52:54,339
Because you are out of it you can handle the situation very well.

965
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:56,939
And you are amazed how things work out.

966
00:52:57,339 --> 00:53:00,979
How things work out and how it helps you.

967
00:53:01,099 --> 00:53:04,259
So you don`t have to worry. You become just the master.

968
00:53:04,459 --> 00:53:06,859
Because you are still not the master.

969
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,779
That`s why there is the problem.

970
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:11,419
But once you are the master you handle all the situation.

971
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:14,219
Then what you do is to give others.

972
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,379
You become so confident, you give others.

973
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:21,259
Now for example now, Dr. Warren went to Australia.

974
00:53:21,459 --> 00:53:24,058
SM: Now the amount of centers is?
SY: Eight.

975
00:53:24,219 --> 00:53:28,259
We have eight centers, and at least three to four thousands people

976
00:53:28,459 --> 00:53:30,058
were realized by him.

977
00:53:31,058 --> 00:53:37,819
So once you become the master, then no, nothing can disturb you.

978
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:40,979
You have no fear because you are the master, You know how to handle.

979
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:43,179
You are the master of the ship.

980
00:53:43,379 --> 00:53:46,779
When the ship is seaworthy and the master is an expert,

981
00:53:46,979 --> 00:53:48,539
he knows how to handle the situation.

982
00:53:48,939 --> 00:53:50,539
In the same way you become the master.

983
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:55,059
That's the point is, you have to become the master.

984
00:53:57,819 --> 00:54:01,539
Make a choice. all right? The question is [unclear], please.

985
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:06,058
Yes, yes, you tell. You are the [winner?].

986
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:10,979
P: Teacher, on our spiritual journey, as we are seekers,

987
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:15,058
how we know a true teacher from a false teacher?

988
00:54:16,139 --> 00:54:19,299
SY: On our Spiritual path for Realization

989
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:22,699
how do we know a true teacher from a false teacher?

990
00:54:22,979 --> 00:54:26,139
SM: It's very simple My child, I tell you to find out.

991
00:54:26,339 --> 00:54:28,939
First thing is that a person who is a true teacher

992
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:31,179
he never takes any money from you. He has to give you.

993
00:54:31,379 --> 00:54:36,299
He doesn't take anything. He cannot sell.

994
00:54:37,058 --> 00:54:39,419
Secondly, the life style of that person

995
00:54:39,699 --> 00:54:41,539
is according to his own balance.

996
00:54:41,819 --> 00:54:44,058
Supposing I'm a carpenter,

997
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:47,058
then I live like a carpenter in complete [unclear].

998
00:54:47,259 --> 00:54:49,699
If I am [not], supposing I'm a wife of such and such.

999
00:54:49,899 --> 00:54:51,539
All right, I live with that.

1000
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:54,219
But I am completely detached about it.

1001
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:57,499
Thirdly, a person who doesn't give you

1002
00:54:57,939 --> 00:55:01,859
the experience of the Divine,

1003
00:55:02,259 --> 00:55:03,739
is not true.

1004
00:55:03,979 --> 00:55:06,059
Truth is what? Not such mesmerism.

1005
00:55:06,259 --> 00:55:09,539
Now how to understand what is their experience of the Divine.

1006
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:13,219
Because Divine does things which human being cannot do.

1007
00:55:13,419 --> 00:55:16,019
Like a flower becomes a fruit. All right?

1008
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:20,259
Now supposing somebody makes you jump, or shout, or scream,

1009
00:55:20,459 --> 00:55:24,058
or makes you say some things going through mantras, this, that.

1010
00:55:24,179 --> 00:55:26,659
Anybody can do, what's so special?

1011
00:55:26,859 --> 00:55:29,058
Any human being can do it. You can always jump,

1012
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:31,939
you can always shout, you can do all kinds of things.

1013
00:55:32,058 --> 00:55:35,779
Somebody mesmerizes you, it's very simple.

1014
00:55:36,058 --> 00:55:40,499
But if you get a cool breeze coming out of your head,

1015
00:55:40,779 --> 00:55:43,539
and through your fingers, this cannot be done.

1016
00:55:43,939 --> 00:55:45,939
This is divine.

1017
00:55:46,058 --> 00:55:48,259
Anybody who does that, is a great teacher.

1018
00:55:48,459 --> 00:55:49,539
Otherwise you become the teacher,

1019
00:55:49,939 --> 00:55:51,899
now why you want a teacher to be followed?

1020
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:55,058
You become the teacher. That is why is Mother's job.

1021
00:55:56,899 --> 00:56:00,939
Mother is the best teacher I think because she is born teacher.

1022
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:07,979
She has to be. And the teacher who loves, who is compassion,

1023
00:56:10,219 --> 00:56:13,979
Is very difficult these days. I wish there were some [unclear]

1024
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:17,939
But they are so [unclear], so difficult.

1025
00:56:18,058 --> 00:56:21,939
Anyone of them takes My responsibility, I would be really happy,

1026
00:56:22,058 --> 00:56:26,058
because to travel all over the world, like this, is too much for Me.

1027
00:56:26,179 --> 00:56:28,299
But I couldn't find anybody who will give you

1028
00:56:28,499 --> 00:56:29,939
that love and affection.

1029
00:56:30,058 --> 00:56:33,299
They get so annoyed and so easily disturbed.

1030
00:56:33,499 --> 00:56:35,939
that they want to go back to their places,

1031
00:56:36,058 --> 00:56:38,459
they don't want to face you, what to do?

1032
00:56:38,859 --> 00:56:40,779
I wish you people become experts

1033
00:56:40,979 --> 00:56:44,058
and do the job for Me. You will do it.

1034
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,058
SM: All right?
SY: Yes.

1035
00:56:47,259 --> 00:56:51,179
What's the vibration, always speak [unclear] and feeling vibrations

1036
00:56:51,379 --> 00:56:54,779
but I don't have sensation of cold.

1037
00:56:54,979 --> 00:56:57,179
SY: Good evening.
P: I [can] get vibrations.

1038
00:56:57,379 --> 00:56:59,019
SY: What, what [unclear]?

1039
00:56:59,139 --> 00:57:00,499
SM: Are you feeling the cool breeze?

1040
00:57:00,779 --> 00:57:02,459
No, that's the point. She said she feels

1041
00:57:02,739 --> 00:57:04,819
that she is [frightened] of vibrations, but is not always cool.

1042
00:57:05,019 --> 00:57:08,058
No, no, cool, it should be cool. It should be cool.

1043
00:57:08,219 --> 00:57:10,899
If it is only vibrations then it's not all right.

1044
00:57:11,058 --> 00:57:13,219
That means the cool breeze is trying to come in

1045
00:57:13,419 --> 00:57:16,699
but there is still an obstruction. All right?

1046
00:57:16,899 --> 00:57:19,659
It's all right. There is nothing wrong, it is all [working].

1047
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:21,859
It will not take much time. It's all right, doesn't matter.

1048
00:57:22,058 --> 00:57:25,059
Just started [unclear], the feeling has started.

1049
00:57:25,259 --> 00:57:28,899
But if it is the cool breeze coming in the hands

1050
00:57:29,058 --> 00:57:34,139
and the cool, not very cool, but cooler type, then it is correct.

1051
00:57:37,459 --> 00:57:40,339
I have two simple questions.

1052
00:57:41,419 --> 00:57:46,058
The first is how to evolve [in collectivity as human race]

1053
00:57:46,179 --> 00:57:50,499
from man to superman. Some people think this was suggested

1054
00:57:50,779 --> 00:57:54,339
[unclear] India and Europe, that we have done so far.

1055
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:57,979
One at a time, yes. What is the first question? Let him.

1056
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:01,939
Maybe he wants to connect it with [You].

1057
00:58:02,058 --> 00:58:09,339
And is Shri Mataji, the only manifestation of the Adi Shakti

1058
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:13,299
in a human body, [in these days].

1059
00:58:16,058 --> 00:58:17,539
Man to superman.

1060
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:21,219
How we evolve, how we are evolving at this stage

1061
00:58:21,419 --> 00:58:23,219
from man to superman?

1062
00:58:23,419 --> 00:58:25,939
And is Shri Mataji,

1063
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:29,819
the only one who is Adi Shakti in a human body

1064
00:58:31,699 --> 00:58:33,739
on the Earth today?

1065
00:58:34,058 --> 00:58:39,299
SM: One answer is...
SY: Sorry ,in this century.

1066
00:58:39,499 --> 00:58:43,499
You better ask the question. And get the vibrations as an answer.

1067
00:58:43,779 --> 00:58:45,659
[unclear], "Mother are You an Incarnation?"

1068
00:58:45,859 --> 00:58:48,899
Ask the question, "Mother are You the Adi Shakti?"

1069
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:50,819
P: Mother are you the Adi Shakti?

1070
00:58:51,019 --> 00:58:52,459
SM: Ask three times.

1071
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:55,419
P: Mother are you the Adi Shakti?
SY: Again.

1072
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,219
Mother are you the Adi Shakti?

1073
00:58:57,419 --> 00:59:00,019
SY: Are you feeling the cool vibrations on your hands?

1074
00:59:00,139 --> 00:59:01,459
P: Yes.
SY: That's your answer.

1075
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:03,899
SM: That's the answer. You are comfortable.

1076
00:59:04,058 --> 00:59:07,499
SY: You can ask any question. It will give you cool vibrations.

1077
00:59:07,779 --> 00:59:11,459
SM: And definitely human beings are, have to evolve.

1078
00:59:11,739 --> 00:59:16,979
They cannot [unclear] unless and until they get their Realization.

1079
00:59:19,779 --> 00:59:23,539
This is the way you can find out whether [unclear].

1080
00:59:24,259 --> 00:59:27,019
All absolute questions can be answered.

1081
00:59:29,219 --> 00:59:32,139
SY: Same, people can ask, "Mother are you the Holy Ghost?"

1082
00:59:32,379 --> 00:59:34,058
[unclear]

1083
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:35,379
SY: Put your hands [unclear].

1084
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:40,779
I think the best you put right [unclear] on the left hand side.

1085
00:59:42,699 --> 00:59:45,379
SY: Close your eyes.
SM: Right hand.

1086
00:59:47,699 --> 00:59:49,379
Right hand up [unclear].

1087
00:59:49,539 --> 00:59:53,539
SY: Left towards Shri Mataji, right hand up in the air like this.

1088
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:56,219
No, like this [unclear].

1089
00:59:57,899 --> 01:00:00,979
Ask it, in your heart.

1090
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:08,819
SM: All right?
SY: Ask it three times.

1091
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:11,058
Yes, it's working out [unclear].

1092
01:00:11,659 --> 01:00:13,379
Put the hand at the back side, like this.

1093
01:00:13,659 --> 01:00:16,779
facing like this, not [unclear].

1094
01:00:25,899 --> 01:00:28,459
He looks so [unclear]. I could not understand. How are you?

1095
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:31,058
Feeling all right?

1096
01:00:31,259 --> 01:00:34,699
What a simple thing has worked out, yes?

1097
01:00:35,859 --> 01:00:39,219
You should come and see Me again to see about it.

1098
01:00:39,819 --> 01:00:43,379
[unclear]

1099
01:00:43,819 --> 01:00:46,539
SM: You are coming to the second?
SY: Yes, yes.

1100
01:00:46,979 --> 01:00:51,779
We are having a seminar, at the weekend.

1101
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:55,739
about eighty miles from here. Very nice place.

1102
01:00:55,939 --> 01:00:58,539
And i don't know, whatever it is.

1103
01:00:58,819 --> 01:01:00,179
And those who want to come,

1104
01:01:00,379 --> 01:01:04,019
should give their addresses to Dr. Warren.

1105
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:07,819
And today is the last day.

1106
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:11,019
And I'm afraid I have to say good bye to you.

1107
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:13,058
I hope I'll try to come next year,

1108
01:01:13,219 --> 01:01:15,139
but I can't say that I'll be here.

1109
01:01:15,499 --> 01:01:19,058
But in any case, let's try to get Realization.

1110
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:22,259
So we put our hands again, like this, and sit comfortable.

1111
01:01:22,459 --> 01:01:23,859
SY: [You take your shoes out].

1112
01:01:24,259 --> 01:01:27,539
Today I think all of you have [unclear] on the heart,

1113
01:01:27,819 --> 01:01:30,019
[little while].

1114
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:35,499
On the heart, more on the heart.

1115
01:01:42,339 --> 01:01:47,379
Put your left hand towards Me, and right hand on the heart.

1116
01:01:47,659 --> 01:01:49,099
And close your eyes,

1117
01:01:49,299 --> 01:01:54,179
putting both the feet on the ground, separately.

1118
01:01:54,499 --> 01:01:58,739
Separated from each other. Just put them on the ground.

1119
01:02:12,419 --> 01:02:15,699
Now put your hand on your heart, and just close your eyes.

1120
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,859
Just close your eyes.

1121
01:02:18,058 --> 01:02:22,419
Close your eyes. Heart.

1122
01:02:24,459 --> 01:02:28,059
Now, today, as it is the last day,

1123
01:02:28,259 --> 01:02:31,459
let's jut be [receptive] about it.

1124
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:36,058
And you have to say,

1125
01:02:36,739 --> 01:02:42,779
in your heart, with full confidence, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

1126
01:02:42,979 --> 01:02:46,459
Say it twelve times.

1127
01:04:10,419 --> 01:04:14,939
You can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head, most of you.

1128
01:04:15,979 --> 01:04:20,058
It's working very fast today. Let's see if it is there.

1129
01:04:23,779 --> 01:04:26,499
Put your left hand towards Me.

1130
01:04:27,058 --> 01:04:29,459
You can feel it first, and then with the right hand.

1131
01:04:29,859 --> 01:04:33,139
See if the cool breeze is coming.

1132
01:05:04,058 --> 01:05:06,659
All right? It's there. Most of you [have got].

1133
01:05:06,859 --> 01:05:09,659
I'll tell you how to raise your Kundalini.

1134
01:05:09,899 --> 01:05:11,739
Today it has worked much faster.

1135
01:05:11,939 --> 01:05:15,058
But those who have not felt the cool breeze we'll see them [after].

1136
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:18,899
First of all, put your left hand in front of your Kundalini.

1137
01:05:19,058 --> 01:05:21,339
Don't get upset if you have not felt. You'll feel.

1138
01:05:21,539 --> 01:05:23,259
Because [unclear].

1139
01:05:23,459 --> 01:05:26,058
Now left hand in front of your Kundalini,

1140
01:05:26,179 --> 01:05:28,058
and right hand has to be moved

1141
01:05:28,219 --> 01:05:31,139
here, front, below, front.

1142
01:05:31,339 --> 01:05:34,779
Like that. We have to raise it now, ourselves.

1143
01:05:39,899 --> 01:05:41,058
Watch your hand.

1144
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:45,379
Now, make your shoulders loose, and push back your head,

1145
01:05:45,539 --> 01:05:50,859
and give them twist, and now a knot.

1146
01:05:52,899 --> 01:05:55,459
We have to do it three times.

1147
01:05:57,299 --> 01:06:01,058
Watch your hand with concentration, left hand.

1148
01:06:01,219 --> 01:06:05,058
Now loosen and put the twist.

1149
01:06:06,058 --> 01:06:08,058
And with a knot.

1150
01:06:08,379 --> 01:06:11,059
Third time, 3 knots [have to do].

1151
01:06:20,499 --> 01:06:27,179
One, two and three.

1152
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:30,299
Now see if you are feeling it.

1153
01:06:34,939 --> 01:06:39,219
All right? You can put up your hands, in the air.

1154
01:06:39,459 --> 01:06:41,339
And now put up your head,

1155
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:44,339
and say, "Mother, is this the Holy Ghost?"

1156
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:48,259
or we can say, "Is this the breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

1157
01:06:52,379 --> 01:06:56,058
Is this the chaitanya lahari of the Adi Shakti?

1158
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:04,058
Ask the question thrice.

1159
01:07:06,779 --> 01:07:08,139
[All you feel it?]

1160
01:07:08,379 --> 01:07:10,259
Now let's see if you have cool breeze in the hand.

1161
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,179
All right? Got it?

1162
01:07:12,659 --> 01:07:15,299
Those who are not feeling it?

1163
01:07:16,058 --> 01:07:18,899
All right, you see Me. Let's see them. They are not feeling it.

1164
01:07:19,058 --> 01:07:22,459
One or two. The Sahaja Yogis will come and see you, all right?

1165
01:07:23,058 --> 01:07:26,259
[But you get it out, you get it all right,] there's no problem.

1166
01:07:26,819 --> 01:07:29,939
Must be some problem there. Who is the gentleman there?

1167
01:07:30,058 --> 01:07:32,019
There's one gentleman there. Can you see [unclear]?

1168
01:07:32,139 --> 01:07:34,979
Dan, are you there?

1169
01:07:38,899 --> 01:07:41,339
SM: This gentleman there.
SY: [unclear]
