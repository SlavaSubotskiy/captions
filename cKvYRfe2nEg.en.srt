2
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:22,300
so now the other Center which we have

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,090
here is very important center call as

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,200
the vishuddhi chakra this is the center

5
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,140
we shoot them

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,980
one is shoot them in spoon but we should

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:36,430
the means absolutely pure this has got

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:39,760
60 patterns as we have got the cervical

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:42,790
plexus expressed the gross which has

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,980
also got sixteen sub-plexuses

11
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:50,740
it tallies with medical science

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:53,500
completely now let us see how is

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:57,790
vishuddhi chakra maintains all the

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:04,089
baubles that he used governorship

15
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:06,690
teacher and like in Devanagari language

16
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:09,870
duties ah

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,870
[Music]

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:22,110
aha so as you know that you cannot come

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:29,810
by the word without a moment it's so

20
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:34,110
important the consonant is weak without

21
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:41,700
near but without any stay without the

22
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:43,590
wall so the strength of a person comes

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,940
through the vishuddhi chakra in his

24
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:50,280
speech it's the center what we call here

25
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,520
is the vishuddhi chakra is the center

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,220
where human beings raise their head up

27
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,740
this is the center that has made us a

28
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:02,250
human being and from this Center only

29
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,430
Rises the ego and superego because this

30
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,039
is the center of collectivity because we

31
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,170
speak through the center we talk through

32
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,209
this we have rapport with other people

33
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,410
through this and as a reaction to that

34
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:18,930
ego and superego is built within us when

35
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:23,700
that is built within us we become a

36
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:25,830
personality I am some he is some you are

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:32,519
some at that point

38
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:36,840
we become a person who has the

39
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:40,350
consciousness of ilus like then I say I

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,600
like this I want this say I will say I

41
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,329
am an Indian you will say I'm an

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,120
Englishman all these misidentifications

43
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:51,060
start because you become an individual

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,560
who tries to identify with many things

45
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:59,549
that's how we become separated from that

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:03,209
power this is the freedom we get where

47
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:05,700
we have to ourself learn from our errors

48
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:09,180
and trials what is right and what is

49
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,910
wrong this vishuddhi chakra is has got

50
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,650
sixteen petals and looks after our ear

51
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:18,540
nose eyes throat everything our face

52
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:21,150
everything is looked after by descent

53
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,660
now this Center also has left and right

54
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:27,160
all centers have left and

55
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:29,590
and when you feel guilty the left Center

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,840
gadgets which is a very dangerous thing

57
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,540
because this gives you diseases like

58
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,830
angina or maybe diseases like

59
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,550
spondylitis

60
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,870
and lethargic organs right when a person

61
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,570
is very aggressive talks very

62
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:48,820
aggressively and tries to dominate

63
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:51,610
others and use his power of speech to

64
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,500
show off the right side catches the the

65
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,980
reactions of this can be many that the

66
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,260
hand gets frozen and they also get the

67
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,890
cancer of the throat all kinds of things

68
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,540
can happen with this chakra being in

69
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:09,780
Japan

70
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,780
[Music]

71
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:23,490
now a person who shouts and screams and

72
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:27,210
talks loudly and loses is tempered in a

73
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:31,320
very loud voice or who speaks very

74
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:35,330
loudly all the time they all suffer from

75
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:38,730
the right wishes so one should

76
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,950
understand that even when you have to

77
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,540
score somebody you have to just say what

78
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,290
are you doing why are you doing like

79
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,280
this

80
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:52,860
otherwise why oh it's finished I'd push

81
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:56,790
it over finished now this is the things

82
00:04:52,860 --> 00:05:00,950
on the right side if you are talking

83
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:05,750
loudly if you talk too much

84
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:09,360
if you intimidate people with your

85
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:12,330
talking then you catch on right

86
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,330
vishuddhi so for that best is to take

87
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:18,270
some rest and give some rest - you're

88
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:22,250
right we should be by stopping your talk

89
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:25,350
go into mana they said just don't talk

90
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,060
for some time if you don't have you'll

91
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,000
see that where we should be will be

92
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:34,110
improved your problems will be in - so

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,570
what is the divine diplomacy you don't

94
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:45,390
have to shout but you change the subject

95
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:48,330
if you want to bring somebody to a some

96
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:51,450
conclusion the best thing is first you

97
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,670
change the subject and gradually if you

98
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:57,590
are clever enough then you go on

99
00:05:53,670 --> 00:06:01,650
changing changing and you bring it back

100
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:04,430
to the right thing that's the clever

101
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,430
thing to do

102
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,419
what is the essence of this diplomacy

103
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:27,240
its benevolence you have to achieve the

104
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:30,030
benevolence of the whole humanity this

105
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,280
is the essence of it if you are doing it

106
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,110
you are not doing for yourself for your

107
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,389
game you are not doing for the gain of

108
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:40,169
any particular person but you are doing

109
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:43,290
it for the benefits of the whole

110
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:47,070
humanity so once you know this is the

111
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,600
essence so what is the need to shout by

112
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,780
shouting you are not going to achieve

113
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,660
anything so to play around with it and

114
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:58,620
bring it to that point which is

115
00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:06,260
benevolence so our right we should be we

116
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:10,410
have to have a temperament a culture a

117
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:12,780
style a behavior which has got the

118
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:17,220
quality which is called as midoriya

119
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:20,340
means melodious melodious you should

120
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:24,419
talk in such a manner that it should be

121
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:27,780
melodious the voice of a sahaja yogi

122
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:32,060
should be sweet like that when you talk

123
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:35,580
to someone it should be melodies

124
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,130
it should not be aggressive at all but

125
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:41,340
on the contrary it should be melodious

126
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:44,880
it should not be sarcastic it should not

127
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:48,870
hurt another person any word that hurts

128
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:52,680
others cannot be coming from the proper

129
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:58,320
type of rightfully so in no way one

130
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:01,560
should hurt the another quality which we

131
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:05,700
can express through our right we should

132
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,310
ease diplomacy but there are two types

133
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:12,020
of diplomacy's one is genuine one is

134
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:15,330
artificial in the genuine diplomacy you

135
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:18,599
do not have to take to a certain

136
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,430
standard or you don't have to read some

137
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:23,660
books

138
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:27,230
to know how it is diplomacy is it

139
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:31,640
genuinely it comes to you it the whole

140
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:35,600
thing works very sweetly in such a

141
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:38,720
genuine manner I have used it many a

142
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,360
times myself and you all can use it also

143
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,480
many a time that's only possible if you

144
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,630
don't get angry with not possible if you

145
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,630
are

146
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:57,880
[Music]

147
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,220
relationship between brothers and

148
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,580
sisters have to be established a very

149
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:09,070
pure brothers and sisters relationship

150
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:11,740
is without any lust or greed it's pure

151
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:15,900
relationship where the sister prays for

152
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:22,240
the protection of the brother and

153
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:24,060
brother play pray praise for the

154
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:31,120
self-sufficiency

155
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:33,580
now the Chima will be of the system so

156
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,410
this time you have to think of your

157
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:41,650
other sahaja Yogi's and sahaja Yogi's

158
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:45,220
who are like your brothers and sisters

159
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:49,570
you have to think like that purify your

160
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,980
hearts something funny in this countries

161
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:55,870
you know that there's no such

162
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,440
relationship bases purify your mind

163
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,279
today

164
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:04,980
on that point that everybody else is my

165
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:08,170
brother or sister if you have married

166
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:11,020
but look at everyone try to look at

167
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:19,029
everyone as a brother and a sister when

168
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:24,750
the sister who is your pure relation is

169
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:31,170
not treated as a sister when the

170
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:35,500
attitude of a person towards women is of

171
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:39,370
indulgence and of lust then he develops

172
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:43,180
the left with you when he develops her

173
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:46,990
left we should be very strongly and if

174
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:49,630
he has a bad Agia or affairs eyes which

175
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:53,110
are roving eyes then this left vishuddhi

176
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:56,110
causes a lot of trouble left vishuddhi

177
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,760
cannot be also caused by as you know by

178
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:02,620
feeling guilty about things for nothing

179
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,890
at all all these problems arise from

180
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:08,149
issues

181
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:15,890
the left side Center is what up when a

182
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:21,620
person feels guilty and obstruct the

183
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:24,019
scent of the Kundalini that's why I

184
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:28,399
always request all the Western seekers

185
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:38,149
first to say in their hearts mother I am

186
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:43,940
NOT GUILTY these are the conditionings

187
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:45,640
that have come to us from so-called

188
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:50,300
religions

189
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:52,700
from so-called psychologists and other

190
00:11:50,300 --> 00:12:00,260
people who are responsible for our

191
00:11:52,700 --> 00:12:03,050
development in our childhood when

192
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:10,100
material things very important for the

193
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:11,870
parents they all the time shout at

194
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,240
children or correct them saying that

195
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:17,380
don't spoil the carpet don't spoil that

196
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,380
don't spoil that

197
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:32,410
and that is how we develop a kind of a

198
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:35,050
guilt within us when we grow up in the

199
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:45,340
schools and colleges this can be built

200
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:50,530
up very heavily within us - so how much

201
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:54,400
important it is to understand the value

202
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:57,610
of left which all of us catch on left

203
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,530
which is D and we do not think that it

204
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,120
is such an important thing where is your

205
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,000
left Rashida catching means I am feeling

206
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,470
guilty we do not understand that what

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,790
have I done I have crossed the limits

208
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:13,000
that's why he's showing there I have

209
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:16,060
neglected some kind of a morality I have

210
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,820
gone on a wrong path against mother and

211
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,430
father that's why I left we should be

212
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:25,330
sketching left switch we should be is

213
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:28,780
the indication of the mistakes of the

214
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:30,940
wrongs of the sins we can't afford to

215
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,450
have left to shooting sahaja Yogi's

216
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:37,030
cannot afford to have left now what I

217
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:42,280
have seen that when this negativity

218
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:45,100
starts acting people instead of facing

219
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,840
it facing the mistakes that I am wrong I

220
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,200
should not have done it it's a wrong

221
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,240
thing to do start giving explanations

222
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,670
once you start giving explanation this

223
00:13:52,240 --> 00:14:00,330
left vishudhi starts becoming like a

224
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:03,190
bloated big lump and then there's no

225
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,470
possibility of curing no possibility of

226
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,470
cleansing so people start giving

227
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:11,830
explanation why I did it why I do this

228
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,570
once it is said it's wrong is wrong to

229
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:17,850
be accepted all right next time I'm not

230
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,850
going to do it I'm very sorry
