1
00:00:01,722 --> 00:00:12,426
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

2
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:17,479
I think we have not understood

3
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:23,127
the significance of Bhairavnath

4
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:32,970
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

5
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:09,856
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

6
00:01:15,282 --> 00:01:25,722
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

7
00:01:32,538 --> 00:01:40,416
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

8
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,789
For example, people have a hot temper,

9
00:01:50,949 --> 00:01:55,222
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

10
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:10,709
And if a person is in a big temper,

11
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:16,721
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

12
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:19,477
to cool him down.

13
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:34,826
He organises everything under his own control

14
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:38,320
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

15
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,346
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

16
00:02:55,746 --> 00:02:59,818
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

17
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:05,999
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

18
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,764
then somehow or other,

19
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:12,014
Bhairavnath will organize,

20
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:15,291
also with the help of Hanumana,

21
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:21,691
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

22
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:48,328
So, for example, people who are depressed

23
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:51,123
or who become left-sided,

24
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:57,249
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

25
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:03,609
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

26
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:07,728
very much more to come out of it.

27
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:28,092
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

28
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:36,111
It is very difficult for a person

29
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:39,996
who is very left-sided,

30
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:45,909
who is all the time feeling very sad,

31
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:49,345
unhappy and worried,

32
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:53,550
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

33
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:09,578
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

34
00:05:09,738 --> 00:05:12,015
does not enjoy any collectivity,

35
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:14,668
doesn't allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

36
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:19,896
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

37
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:37,628
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

38
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:39,651
is something superior.

39
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:45,115
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

40
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,831
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

41
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,978
all the time thinks,

42
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:02,735
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

43
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,985
I'm so depressed," this, that,

44
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:08,289
all the time expecting from others something,

45
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:13,742
also cannot enjoy the collective.

46
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,814
Such a left-sided person will find

47
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:40,397
everything is something unhappy.

48
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,270
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

49
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:55,496
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

50
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:59,062
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

51
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:09,477
So, we went to have our food

52
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:14,583
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

53
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,407
but then a car came in and we went there.

54
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:33,509
Then they said that

55
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,797
"You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

56
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,922
you have to take the seats which were more expensive."

57
00:07:50,222 --> 00:07:52,043
So this lady started saying,

58
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:57,326
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

59
00:07:57,486 --> 00:08:00,718
and we can't get a seat."

60
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:12,621
I said, "This is all fun;

61
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:15,210
this is not something a problem."

62
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,939
This 'problema' word should be given up.

63
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:30,409
This is a new word I have learned,

64
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,918
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

65
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:37,342
in our young age.

66
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,359
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

67
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,308
to find everything negative

68
00:08:54,468 --> 00:09:00,789
is the way we really spoil our left side.

69
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:12,436
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

70
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:18,163
and he said, "We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.'

71
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:30,599
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

72
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,169
everything was fine.

73
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:34,593
I said, "See now, you were only counting

74
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:38,985
how many negative things there are,

75
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:50,223
and you were not seeing the fun."

76
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,643
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

77
00:09:57,803 --> 00:10:00,931
"You take Bhairava's name,

78
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,518
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

79
00:10:07,678 --> 00:10:09,405
and right hand on the Mother Earth

80
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:13,610
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away."

81
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:23,439
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

82
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:26,729
always light in His hand.

83
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:35,378
And He runs up and down

84
00:10:35,822 --> 00:10:42,668
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

85
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:54,526
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

86
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:02,456
One of the negativities are that,

87
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:05,933
"This is mine",

88
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:19,299
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my ..."

89
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:26,575
So then, you see, once you get attached

90
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:29,914
in this manner, what you find,

91
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:36,309
that your children also become negative.

92
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:50,047
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

93
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,824
And for that you should see, 'Where is your attention?"

94
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:04,759
Are you only seeing problema

95
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,094
or you are seeing some fun in it?

96
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:23,065
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

97
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:32,491
If it's a sunny day they'll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

98
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:42,006
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

99
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,238
"Oh, what a day!"

100
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:51,163
Nothing can please them.

101
00:12:52,424 --> 00:12:58,626
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

102
00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:02,351
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

103
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:16,202
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

104
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:22,355
Also, it's not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

105
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:25,713
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

106
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:30,029
then how can there be ignorance?

107
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:42,373
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

108
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,810
if you hide, run away,

109
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,197
you will say that there is negativity.

110
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,686
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

111
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:04,251
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

112
00:14:09,211 --> 00:14:13,640
So those people who cannot become collective,

113
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,736
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

114
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:34,322
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

115
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:43,206
They say there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

116
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:52,060
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

117
00:14:55,136 --> 00:15:00,283
They are saying, "See there's so many problem, ecological problem."

118
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:02,582
They are drunkards, all drunk,

119
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:06,588
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

120
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:10,813
When will this end?"

121
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:22,757
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

122
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:28,006
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

123
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:39,444
Then the third one says,

124
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:43,878
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

125
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:53,381
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

126
00:15:57,806 --> 00:16:03,991
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

127
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:13,147
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

128
00:16:14,684 --> 00:16:17,237
They cannot see fun at all,

129
00:16:17,305 --> 00:16:20,590
they cannot enjoy at all,

130
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:26,433
and they become very,

131
00:16:26,537 --> 00:16:29,007
sort of think they are very meditative,

132
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:32,973
they are some higher people, they are something superior

133
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,103
in negativity.

134
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:53,224
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

135
00:16:56,027 --> 00:17:01,785
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

136
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:09,715
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

137
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:15,357
and while going there I met a lady,

138
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:18,225
and she was quite all right, I mean,

139
00:17:18,322 --> 00:17:20,750
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

140
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:24,134
so I started talking to her.

141
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,826
And she started talking very wisely,

142
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,365
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

143
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:39,844
isn't it necessary that he should be helped,

144
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:41,711
and we should not do this, that..."

145
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:45,968
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

146
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:57,099
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

147
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:00,716
and no one loves her.

148
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:10,710
And she said, "I'm very insecure" and this and that.

149
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:18,238
Suddenly the doctor came in

150
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:22,249
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

151
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:25,595
I said, "What's this?"

152
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:35,033
So the doctor sent for people that,

153
00:18:35,193 --> 00:18:36,742
"Catch hold of this woman!"

154
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:41,076
He told Me, "She's the most violent lunatic

155
00:18:47,488 --> 00:18:50,219
and why are You talking to her?"

156
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:56,743
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

157
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,627
Maybe in My presence, as bhoot might have little bit

158
00:19:03,787 --> 00:19:05,845
run away and were playing tricks,

159
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:10,574
but you can see that, clearly.

160
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:19,071
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

161
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:23,121
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

162
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:27,799
you see, "This is my child, this is my this thing,

163
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,635
this is this and this is that,"

164
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,443
and all the time wasting your precious life

165
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:37,734
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

166
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,980
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

167
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,920
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

168
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:03,077
So, one has to know that

169
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:07,424
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

170
00:20:10,788 --> 00:20:14,443
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

171
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:21,743
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

172
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:31,203
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

173
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:37,482
and funny ideas about attachments

174
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:44,254
and also the depressiveness.

175
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:47,464
So, today we are, I am very happy

176
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:51,364
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

177
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:56,892
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

178
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,282
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

179
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:10,551
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

180
00:21:10,711 --> 00:21:14,735
and goes to the right side.

181
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:25,647
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

182
00:21:25,807 --> 00:21:32,500
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

183
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:45,227
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath statue

184
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:49,288
which is really Swayambhu.

185
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:55,566
And people are more left-sided,

186
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:59,292
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

187
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:07,256
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

188
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,123
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

189
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:15,668
and put His light there, make a flame.

190
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:26,500
I mean, the police takes them,

191
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:32,992
and then they ask them, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

192
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:43,381
And they confess what wrong they have done.

193
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:53,233
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

194
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,894
sly things like thieving.

195
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:07,429
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

196
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:11,822
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

197
00:23:18,154 --> 00:23:23,232
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

198
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:31,780
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

199
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:39,701
So, today we are here to worship

200
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:42,303
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

201
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:47,036
who incarnated on this earth later on,

202
00:23:54,995 --> 00:23:58,503
ultimately as Mahavira also.

203
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:04,395
So, He stands on the gate of hell

204
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,441
and stops people from falling into hell.

205
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:18,363
But if you want to go to hell,

206
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,651
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

207
00:24:21,811 --> 00:24:23,358
that I should go to hell,then He says,

208
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:27,407
'All right, you can go.'

209
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:40,118
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people,

210
00:24:43,937 --> 00:24:50,019
so is better that we should try to fight our negativity

211
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:57,083
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

212
00:25:09,532 --> 00:25:13,404
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

213
00:25:13,564 --> 00:25:18,828
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

214
00:25:27,858 --> 00:25:35,310
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

215
00:25:38,343 --> 00:25:45,473
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

216
00:25:54,031 --> 00:25:57,601
May God bless you all.
