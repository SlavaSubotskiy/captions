1
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:08,690
First time when I came to United States, I
came to Los Angeles first.

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,761
Because, it’s a place of angels.

3
00:00:11,786 --> 00:00:17,971
Actually, I thought that it must be a very
holy place to come down.

4
00:00:17,996 --> 00:00:25,189
First of all, in this great land of United
States.

5
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:32,820
Now, as you know that United States or America,
the whole of it, is the Vishuddhi chakra.

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:42,720
Out of which, we have three sides to the Vishuddhi
chakra.

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,979
So, the central part of the Vishuddhi chakra
is United States.

8
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:55,410
The central part of the Vishuddhi chakra is
governed by Shri Krishna.

9
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,426
And His power is Radha.

10
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,213
“ RA - DHA “ .

11
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:07,375
“RA” means energy, “DHA” is the one
who has sustained the energy.

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,454
“RA - DHA”.

13
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:09,898
“dha-re-ti-saa” .

14
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:18,425
So, she’s the one who has sustained the
energy, and so, she’s called as Radha.

15
00:01:18,457 --> 00:01:21,800
She’s the power of Shri Krishna.

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:30,250
The word Krishna comes from the word - krishi,
means - the plowing, or you can say, agriculture

17
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,890
is called as “krishi”.

18
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:41,000
The one who plows and puts the seed in the
soil, is doing the krishi.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,280
And, that’s why he’s called as Krishna.

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:54,808
Now, the seed that he has sown, is the seed
of spirituality.

21
00:01:54,851 --> 00:02:03,528
It is Shri Krishna who said, in sanskrit - “nainam
chindanti shastrani nainam dahati pavakah

22
00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:09,307
na chainam kledayanty apo na sosayati marutah.

23
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:14,170
” meaning - it
cannot be, means, the spiritual life or you

24
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:23,632
can say, the eternal life, or the spirit,
cannot be killed by anything, by any weapon,

25
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:31,800
neither can be blown away by air, nor can
it be sucked in, nor can it be destroyed.

26
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,119
So, to prove that, Christ came on this earth,
and through his resurrection he proved, what

27
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:41,520
Shri Krishna has said.

28
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:47,660
And most of you Sahaj yogis know the relationship
of Christ and Shri Krishna - why he was called

29
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,660
Christ.

30
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,540
Christ word comes from the same - Krishi.

31
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:56,955
And, his first name comes from the word Yashoda.

32
00:02:57,217 --> 00:03:00,590
Yashoda is also called as je-su or ye-su.

33
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:10,110
And that’s why (Krish) Christ was called
as Je-su or Ye-su.

34
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,380
Some people call him Yesu, and some people
call him as Jesu, because of Yashoda (the

35
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,992
mother), the foster mother of Shri Krishna.

36
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:26,939
Also, you know that Radha was the same as
MahaLakshmi, so she was the same as the mother

37
00:03:26,964 --> 00:03:28,410
of Christ, Mary.

38
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:34,812
These, all these things we can prove it in
Sahaj Yoga.

39
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:41,069
Because, when the Kundalini moves up to the
Vishuddhi chakra, and if it stops there, you

40
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:49,020
can ask the question - (“Was Krishna the
son of mother Mary - no) Was Jesus the son

41
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,090
of mother Mary?

42
00:03:51,090 --> 00:04:00,720
Was the son of Ra, was the same as Radha,
and then the Kundalini moves.

43
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,920
So, Sahaja Yoga today is a thing which proves
what has been said so far.

44
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
It proves.

45
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,390
It’s not just a cock and bull story.

46
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,000
Because people do not believe into all these
things.

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,910
They think that it’s all cock and bull story.

48
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,910
Who was Christ?

49
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,910
Who was Krishna?

50
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,910
Who was Radha?

51
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,500
After all, there was no God.

52
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:26,926
But only in Sahaja Yoga, today, we can prove
it, that what we say is the truth.

53
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:33,280
Because, as through realization, you get connected
to the mains.

54
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,450
Your vibrations start flowing.

55
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,320
Like the computer, you start working.

56
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,490
And whatever question you ask, answer comes
to you as tremendous vibrations, or it stops

57
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,400
or you might get heat or you may get blisters.

58
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,000
So, the whole message is communicated to you
through your finger tips.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,120
As Mohammad Sahab has very clearly said, that
“at the time of resurrection, your hands

60
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,970
will speak”.

61
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,510
But the muslims do not want to talk about
resurrection at all.

62
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,380
Because, they want to frighten people with
the doomsday.

63
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,183
They don’t want to talk about the resurrection
time which is going to come, which is the

64
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,532
intermediary time.

65
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:24,600
Because they want to use the time, which will
frighten people by saying that “now your

66
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,710
doomsday is coming”!

67
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,430
Now, your doomsday is coming, so everybody
is frightened about God and they think that

68
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,321
now we should just wait for our doom, nothing
else is in between.

69
00:05:35,346 --> 00:05:39,330
So, this is how the Vishuddhi chakra is a
special one.

70
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:45,000
Now Vishuddhi chakra (is) was created on the
Saturday.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,760
So, it is the Saturn - that’s the important
star of the Vishuddhi chakra.

72
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:58,361
So, whenever the Saturn is at the highest,
America will be in a better place to do things.

73
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,120
But, I don’t think they know much about
themselves.

74
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,150
They don’t know what they are, why they
are on this earth, what is their work, what

75
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:16,060
they are supposed to do, or what is the purpose
of God of creating America.

76
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:23,550
The first job of the Vishuddhi chakra within
us was that, when we became human beings,

77
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,970
we raised our heads up like that.

78
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:32,870
When you raise your head up like that, you
have become a human being, in the sense that

79
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,290
now, there is a new movement in your consciousness.

80
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:44,900
Now the new movement in your consciousness
started about 6000 years back when Shri Krishna

81
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,070
came on this earth.

82
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,880
That the new movement was, that it is the
Father.

83
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,890
The advent of the Father was celebrated, and
that’s how people developed a kind of a

84
00:06:57,915 --> 00:07:04,142
new instrument within themselves, called ego.

85
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:11,640
When the brain was lifted like this you see,
it expanded in a pyramidical - it’s a pyramid

86
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,620
- it became a pyramid.

87
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,520
In an animal, the brain is flat.

88
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,240
And, gradually it rises.

89
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,820
When the head was raised, when the responsibility
was taken of raising the head, the brain started

90
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,979
growing in such a way that it became a pyramid.

91
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:34,290
And when it became a pyramid, the attention
became a different attention from that of

92
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,290
animal.

93
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:43,300
Because, when the waves of your consciousness
fell on the sides of the pyramid, they went

94
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:50,060
into the parallelogram of forces, by which
the resultant force - the resultant force

95
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:58,850
- now, it falls like this, goes like that,
the resultant force is like that - had two

96
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,749
sides - one was this, another was this .

97
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:09,440
So the consciousness, or we can say, the attention
- instead of going inside, started going out!

98
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,150
So, one part of the resultant was going outside
and that’s how, when you became a human

99
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,639
being, your attention went outside.

100
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,780
Is the human beings only, who have their attention
outside.

101
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:29,869
Not that the animals don’t have, but the
attention of human beings are such that they

102
00:08:29,894 --> 00:08:31,861
create reactions.

103
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,060
Like, you see something.

104
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:42,829
Now, I see Doctor’s house for example, then
a reaction starts in my mind - what is this,

105
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:48,209
what does this mean, how much it must have
cost, from where did he buy it!

106
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:51,439
Anything you see, it starts giving you a reaction.

107
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:52,800
Not to the animals.

108
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,690
Animals, at the most they will say - this
I must eat, that I must eat, that I must get!

109
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,870
But, they do not think about it.

110
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,420
It’s only the human beings who reflect.

111
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:11,540
And this reflection comes because of the pyramid-like
structure of the brain.

112
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:21,260
And, this has a special reaction in the brain
itself, that we start developing our own ego,

113
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,990
our own myths, our own mental projections.

114
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:32,250
And when we develop our own mental projections,
this ego starts developing - I know - what’s

115
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,240
wrong, all these nonsensical things come.

116
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,630
And once that starts working out, the balloon
of the ego starts rising.

117
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:45,240
It starts pushing the other balloon which
was within us, is of the superego - as an

118
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
animal.

119
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,600
And then, comes up in the center.

120
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,649
That’s how we now become normal human beings.

121
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:57,360
But then we start increasing our ego.

122
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:07,510
It starts overlapping the superego, and a
calcification takes place, by which we develop

123
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,690
our I-ness.

124
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:16,339
So, it is all the happening that takes place
after we have lifted our head, raised our

125
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:19,790
head, and we are no more like animals.

126
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:27,399
So, Vishuddhi chakra has a very big part to
play in the human evolution, that by developing

127
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:34,838
your Vishuddhi chakra, you have become human
beings, first of all.

128
00:10:34,863 --> 00:10:43,800
Secondly, because it is the chakra of the
father, who becomes again, the primordial

129
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,892
- as you call it, in a (marathi).

130
00:10:54,873 --> 00:10:55,873
macrocosm.

131
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:58,990
You become the macrocosm.

132
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,379
You are the microcosm, and the father is the
macrocosm.

133
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:11,879
So, you become that because of the Vishuddhi
chakra, which is governed by Shri Krishna,

134
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,969
who becomes that macrocosm, called as Virat.

135
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:19,759
In the brain it is expressed in this part

136
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:22,509
In this part of the head.

137
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:31,430
It is here that you start manifesting your
macrocosm qualities - at this point.

138
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:38,179
Now, this Vishuddhi chakra has a speciality
- is that, we always say that the responsibility

139
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:39,179
on my shoulders.

140
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:43,160
Always we say that - the responsibilities
are on my shoulders.

141
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:50,186
The reason is, the Vishuddhi chakra gives
you the sense of responsibility.

142
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:54,817
And that’s why you know, the Americans feel
responsible for the whole world.

143
00:11:54,842 --> 00:11:57,167
Naturally!

144
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:03,259
It’s perfectly understood, that they feel
responsible for the whole world.

145
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:13,910
But how much they are aware of their role
as the responsible people, that’s a different point.

146
00:12:14,248 --> 00:12:22,189
But they feel, they are responsible, but their
role, as responsible people, if they understand

147
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:25,839
that they have to be ideals.

148
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,149
Ideals.

149
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:33,489
Because a person who is a responsible person
in a family, has to be the ideal for others.

150
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:37,463
It started very well, I should say, at the
time of Abraham Lincoln.

151
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:38,875
It started very well.

152
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:45,059
When you started talking about democracy,
is also - democracy is nothing but collectivity.

153
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:50,563
He started talking about the collectivity
of the people, by the people.

154
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:57,929
All that shows that the sense of collectivity
started coming right in this Vishuddhi chakra.

155
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:08,221
But then, people who are in the center, can
only remain normal.

156
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:16,160
But those who bend too much, or who bend backward
too much, both suffer from problems.

157
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,607
The ones who bend forward to others, are the
people who get their superego.

158
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,350
They get over-humble-down, like developing
countries are.

159
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:32,959
And those who bend backward, are the people
who try to dominate others.

160
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,240
Who have ego.

161
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:44,459
So, because of sudden blessings of God, they
discovered so many things.

162
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:48,459
The ego started developing in America too
much.

163
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:51,420
But ego is like a balloon, as I told you.

164
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,480
And, keeps you floating in the air.

165
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,812
And when you are in the air, you become shallow
people.

166
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,949
You have no moorings.

167
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:07,610
But, it has one more advantage, if you knew
you are floating in the air, you can have

168
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,451
a complete comprehensive view.

169
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:20,199
Complete vision of the Whole, if your eyes
are pure and your intentions are clear-cut.

170
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:28,899
Now (the) another thing that happens by their
coming here, was the problem, that they felt

171
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,008
that - we are a very new nation.

172
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:35,999
It has an advantage, as well as, it has a
disadvantage.

173
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:45,059
Advantage is that if you are new, it’s very
good because you can be transformed into something

174
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:49,558
better very easily, because there is no conditioning
in your mind.

175
00:14:49,637 --> 00:14:58,779
You are very clean, absolutely ready, to become
something (?).

176
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:05,600
Or else, can be possibility that, you are
so new that you are awed by everything that

177
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,019
is old, which is very true about Americans,
that they bought all the old bridges from

178
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:15,480
England to bring them down here.

179
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,980
And the cravings about the old is too much
here.

180
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,690
And that, as if whatever is new, is all absurd!

181
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,490
So, maybe even Sahaja Yoga maybe an absurd
thing for them.

182
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:31,879
Because according to them, this is something
new.

183
00:15:31,904 --> 00:15:36,359
Because they are new nations, they have started
discarding all that is new.

184
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:38,839
Is an absurd thing.

185
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:45,100
Now, we must say that Sahaja Yoga, as it is
today, is the most ancient thing.

186
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:54,220
It started with the universe and now the culmination
point has come, because it is a living process.

187
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,680
As you see a flower on the tree, it’s the
first new flower.

188
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:06,480
But the flower has come out of a seed, which
has got the roots and then it became the trunk,

189
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,970
then it became the leaves, and then it has
now become a flower.

190
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:17,199
So, though it looks a new flower, it has a
big heritage.

191
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,949
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is as ancient
as this universe is.

192
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:30,679
But to people, who have such a hankering for
traditionalism, find it difficult to find

193
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,309
out what is real tradition.

194
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:36,889
Only those who are traditional people, can
know what is real tradition.

195
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:44,899
Last time I came here, in America, and I was
shocked that a person came to interview me.

196
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:51,160
And when he was talking, he asked about one
gentleman who was most untraditional from

197
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,339
Indian point of view.

198
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:54,558
His name was Ramakrishna Paramhamsa.

199
00:16:54,605 --> 00:16:57,343
He married a woman and made her a mother.

200
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:58,272
I mean, it’s,

201
00:16:58,336 --> 00:17:00,002
nobody has done it.

202
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:00,914
Rama has not done it.

203
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:02,207
Krishna has not done it.

204
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:04,319
It’s an absurd stuff.

205
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,440
But for them, he was the most traditional
man.

206
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,501
And he told me that , mother your Sahaja Yoga
is not traditional if you don’t believe

207
00:17:10,526 --> 00:17:12,469
in Ramakrishna.

208
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:17,880
Last fifty-sixty years, all such neo-traditional
people came up.

209
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,790
Another one was this Pondicherry fellow.

210
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,740
Another absurd situation.

211
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,940
He called this woman a mother, and his relation
with her is ambiguous.

212
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,210
You don’t know what relationship they had.

213
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,300
I mean that is something, in Indian tradition,
is an impossible situation.

214
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,900
You have to have clear-cut relationship with
everyone.

215
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,120
You cannot have ambiguous.

216
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,650
Neither a friend, nor a wife, nor a mother
or a sister.

217
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,340
That kind of a situation is most untraditional.

218
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,610
Is never thought of.

219
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,530
I mean, you Indians can know this is not possible.

220
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,930
This is an absurd situation.

221
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,814
But, for some people, he is traditional.

222
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:03,420
What happened, about sixty years back, I think
about the time of my birth only, the negativity

223
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:09,150
started taking a new form in understanding
the western confusion.

224
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,990
They are all western in this, if you see them.

225
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:18,162
And the western confusion they took over for
their own advantages.

226
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:20,940
They used it for their own advantages.

227
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,120
And this is where the western people have
failed to make them out.

228
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:36,877
The other day, at the Jungian place, I was
to talk to Jung people with Sahaja Yoga and Jung.

229
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:42,858
Now Jung, I came to know only when he died,
because there was a little article about him.

230
00:18:42,883 --> 00:18:45,112
I never studied psychology.

231
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:47,980
Of course, I tried to learn some vocabulary
to talk to them.

232
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,530
Sometimes I thought, I may have to talk to
them also.

233
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:55,410
But these Jungians, all very intellectuals
and great people sitting before me, you see.

234
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,000
(not clear)[I won’t heard of them?] the
President of American Jungian society.

235
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,082
I’d just gone through a book, just before
starting it, and I saw some diagrams

236
00:19:06,107 --> 00:19:08,824
 which really puzzled me.

237
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:12,740
The first conception they had, of course it’s
all mental conception of Jung.

238
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,050
I don’t blame him because he got realization
but he did not know how the state was created,

239
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:25,140
was what the framework of the state and his
movement was still of a seeker to find out

240
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,870
how he got his realization.

241
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,810
And, all movements were linear.

242
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,560
They were not expanding from one point all
over.

243
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,820
So, it was not so integrated.

244
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,830
Now, the thing they showed was that at the
bottom of it was the unconscious, which is

245
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,450
never going to be conscious.

246
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:46,120
On top of that was the (conscious) unconscious
that can be conscious.

247
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,780
Then, there was subconscious and on top of
that was the ego.

248
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,950
I mean what a mess of a thing it was I tell
you.

249
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,660
I told them, see, now the word unconscious
itself is confusing.

250
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,960
What do you mean by unconscious?

251
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,760
Whatever you don’t feel on your central
nervous system is unconscious - alright?

252
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,370
But, what does that mean?

253
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,160
We don’t feel the subconscious.

254
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,280
Then, subconscious is also unconscious.

255
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,970
Whatever we don’t feel - for example, there
are certain sounds of certain frequencies

256
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,010
we don’t hear at all.

257
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,930
We hear whatever is tolerable to us as human
beings.

258
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,870
That you all scientists know.

259
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,260
We don’t hear everything.

260
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,440
So, all that is unconscious - means it’s
a mixed bag.

261
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,130
All sorts of things mixed up together.

262
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,290
But God is not a hodge podge person you see.

263
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,920
He is a clear-cut gentleman.

264
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,320
He knows what he is doing.

265
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,830
He is the greatest organizer.

266
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:51,570
And, how can he put you into a bag like that
- that the unconscious is below, then on top

267
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:56,580
of it is the unconscious that is going to
be conscious, on top of it is the subconscious,

268
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,490
on top of the consciousness, on top of that
the ego!

269
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,720
So you go down, carrying all this inside you
and where do you go?

270
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,810
Now, how do you go?

271
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:16,337
So the first mistake was that there are layers
one on top of another - it’s not so.

272
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:20,210
They are placed vertically.

273
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:25,400
The ego is on the right hand side and superego
on the left hand side.

274
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,030
The future on the right hand side and the
past on the left hand side.

275
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:35,510
So the subconscious on the left hand side
and the supraconscious on the right hand side.

276
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,360
And the central path is kept clear cut.

277
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:44,312
I mean in any organization, say if you go
to the airport, do you have like this that

278
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:47,770
you have to pass through the walls to go to
the aeroplane.

279
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:54,110
If we human beings don’t commit such horrible
mistakes, how can God commit such a mistake?

280
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,920
So it was absolutely wrong to think that way.

281
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,650
So, the central path is in the center while
the right side is on the right side and the

282
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,750
left side on the left side.

283
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,120
And you don’t have to go to the subconscious
at all.

284
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,780
Because they justified all these people who
are trying to make them hypnosis or they are

285
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:20,150
trying to hypnotize them or to give them a
new type of a - sort of an experience - all

286
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,160
that was unconscious, we should accept that.

287
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,808
Even some people if they start suddenly jumping,
they say - oh that’s great.

288
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:30,577
So the sensations that you get from the subconscious
and the supraconscious

289
00:22:30,602 --> 00:22:32,560
were accepted as something great.

290
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:36,330
It was a confusion of your intellectuals I
should say.

291
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,330
Complete.

292
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,970
But it is not so.

293
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,140
Your path is straightforward.

294
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,050
Absolutely for Kundalini.

295
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:49,480
Only thing, the one who has to raise it had
to come - that’s all.

296
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,270
But otherwise, it’s all very well, there
is no need for you to get into that horrible

297
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,270
subconscious.

298
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,995
When I told them, they were amazed.

299
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,542
They said - Mother it is so simple.

300
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:00,570
I said - it’s very simple.

301
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,200
Your unconscious is divided into four.

302
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,810
One is the collective subconscious, one is
the collective supraconscious, one is - you

303
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:17,520
can say - the collective hell, and on top
is the super collective consciousness.

304
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,430
So where do we have to go?

305
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,275
We should know our destination.

306
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,670
Then, we have to reach.

307
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:31,858
And that is how the problem of all these people
getting entangled with Muktanand.

308
00:23:31,883 --> 00:23:34,600
Yes, they asked me a question - What is wrong
with Muktanand?

309
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,130
Why is he so dangerous?

310
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:40,432
One lady, poor thing, as Sahaj would have
it, she came, she said - oh I went there,

311
00:23:40,457 --> 00:23:42,840
I broke my back and I’m finished once and
for all.

312
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,290
He’s such a dangerous man.

313
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,290
He flattered me.

314
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,610
I went there and I don’t know what has happened
to my back.

315
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,190
I can’t sit for more than ten minutes in
one place, I have to get up.

316
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,370
And I have a vibrator, I have to always put
it like that.

317
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,050
So I said, see the dangers.

318
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:02,590
Then the another theory they started that
we must suffer if we have to go to God.

319
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,590
Why?

320
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,080
I mean that’s not God’s idea by any chance.

321
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,480
Why should you suffer?

322
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,690
He made Christ suffer for you - finished now.

323
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,690
You better not suffer.

324
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,510
There’s no need to suffer at all.

325
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:18,200
So, all these ideas penetrated into these
western people.

326
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,390
And these mental projections - they accepted
without even understanding what is written

327
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,390
in other books.

328
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,450
We should see.

329
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,970
And they could only go as far as the sixty
years where all these horrible people who

330
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,100
went to India, very shallow people.

331
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,110
They saw some of these tantric books, because
they wanted to justify Freud through Indian

332
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,130
culture.

333
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,800
So they got the tantricas, erotic things and
all that and brought these books and some

334
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,720
of them read - I don’t know what books - to
say that Kundalini is in the stomach, somebody

335
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,380
says in the brain.

336
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,630
I mean they don’t know where the Kundalini
is.

337
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,200
They are writing such big big books.

338
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Can you imagine?

339
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,210
Such big big books they have written.

340
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,230
Now, when the books are written, every book
is not a scripture.

341
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,710
But to them, if it is written in the book
you see, it’s a scripture.

342
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,820
And that’s how the whole confusion started
going on.

343
00:25:05,845 --> 00:25:12,247
So these people came down, took full advantage
of it and now they have become great gurus

344
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:15,476
with lot of money.

345
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:16,985
Rich people.

346
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:31,260
But now, as the hand of God is great, one
by one, they are getting out of the heads

347
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,710
of these people.

348
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,550
And now I hope a day will come when people
will see the light.

349
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:43,230
So the task of Sahaja Yoga is to establish
the truth within yourself.

350
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,650
It is not that we can have membership.

351
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,300
We cannot have a person enroll into it.

352
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,800
We cannot call them as branded Sahaja yogis.

353
00:25:53,825 --> 00:25:56,980
It’s the growth of the person - that is
to be seen.

354
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,810
Now there are so many lectures which I have
given about ritambhara pragya and all these

355
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:07,150
things and I think for every sahaja yogi it
is necessary to listen to those lectures,

356
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:13,220
go through it, understand them and to meditate
so that you grow.

357
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,350
Because it is not a plastic thing that we
can create.

358
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:24,250
It’s a living process of the living energy
of the living God.

359
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,080
And so, it has to grow.

360
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:33,160
By thinking you cannot make it grow but by
not thinking, you allow it to grow more and

361
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,160
more.

362
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:39,030
As it starts growing within you, then only
you realize what you are.

363
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:44,210
That’s the only way you have to reach that
state of superconsciousness and establish

364
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,710
yourself there.

365
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,492
Then only you will know what I’m talking
about.

366
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:50,970
Now today’s puja is another thing.

367
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:51,970
Now, what is a Puja.

368
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:54,913
Can you people say what a puja is?

369
00:26:55,064 --> 00:26:59,100
Actually yesterday I had a puja and it’s
not easy for me to bear the pujas to be very

370
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,360
frank you know.

371
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,450
Because the vibrations are so much that I
don’t know.

372
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,870
And then, I went to the airport - two hours
we took out the vibrations and put them for

373
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,280
all the New York airport.

374
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,340
It was necessary.

375
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,740
It worked out.

376
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:21,241
Because vibrations start flowing with tremendous
force and if you people do not absorb it,

377
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:25,800
it takes time for it to ooze out from my body.

378
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,410
Makes me rather heavy with it.

379
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:35,870
But, then it oozes out and I feel better and
only thing that happens by saying the mantras,

380
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:42,809
you awaken the deities within yourself and
start receiving the vibrations.

381
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:48,950
And when your deities are awakened, they are
awakened through the power of the deities

382
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,600
within me - they have to work very hard to
do that, and that’s how they emit too much

383
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,890
vibrations which must be absorbed by you when
your deities are awakened.

384
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,650
That’s how it works.

385
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,710
You cannot describe it in words.

386
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,803
You cannot tell it in words.

387
00:28:04,828 --> 00:28:07,267
It’s a happening that has to take place.

388
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:11,210
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga first,
can go little bit like that

389
00:28:11,235 --> 00:28:12,465
in the beginning.

390
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:18,490
Gradually they settle down, come round, grow
into it, then it becomes alright.

391
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:22,090
Some people just shoot off in one day, and
they are there.

392
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,590
Makes no difference whatsoever.

393
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,690
Because it’s a growing thing and it has
to grow.

394
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:33,240
With some people , the land is so fertile,
or maybe something, that it just works out

395
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
fast.

396
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,430
So, nobody should blame anyone.

397
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,824
And specially, one should not feel guilty
because that’s the vishuddhi on the left

398
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:40,871
hand side.

399
00:28:40,974 --> 00:28:46,500
Specially for America, I’m wearing this
stone which is called as the black sapphire.

400
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,020
Because, this is the stone of Shri Krishna.

401
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,630
It’s the stone of Vishuddhi chakra.

402
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,130
Every chakra has a stone.

403
00:28:55,155 --> 00:28:59,651
And this is the stone of the Vishuddhi chakra,
so I’m wearing this, just for coming to

404
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:00,333
America.

405
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:16,490
And, I hope that today’s worship will bring
out the potential of this country by exciting

406
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:22,490
the deities, Shri Krishna himself, who is
in charge.

407
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,350
By pleasing him.

408
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,830
By making him active.

409
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:32,860
And, he has great qualities, and one of the
greatest qualities he has that he has the

410
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,370
- sanwahra shakti - by which he can kill the
demons.

411
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:40,280
And, all those demons who are settled down
here, are really mistaken.

412
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:46,590
Because, if this is the place of Shri Krishna,
they are very dangerously placed.

413
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:51,420
Because once he is awakened here, they all
will be completely finished through his sudarashan

414
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:56,280
chakra, which he has in his hand and he can
just kill them one by one.

415
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:03,386
But first he’s to be pleased, and he’s
to be awakened, he has to be “prasanna”.

416
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:04,520
That’s the word.

417
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,760
Prasanna means, to be pleased.

418
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,220
And then, it works out.

419
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,680
So today first we will have Ganesha’s puja,
little bit, because Ganesha’s puja is meant

420
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,360
just to establish the innocence.

421
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,790
The innocence of the place.

422
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,940
Once the innocence is established, that’s
the most important.

423
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,940
That’s the essence of everything.

424
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,990
Ganesha is the essence.

425
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:31,170
And, then we will have Shri Krishna puja and
then the puja of the Devi of the Power.

426
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:37,000
So, that’s how we’ll have three pujas
- one after another, but a short time every

427
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
time.

428
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,020
Alright?
