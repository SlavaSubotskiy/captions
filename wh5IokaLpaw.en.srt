1
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:09,525
First time when I came to United States,
I came to Los Angeles first.

2
00:00:09,726 --> 00:00:11,682
Because it’s a place of angels.

3
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:17,804
Actually, I thought that it must be a very
holy place to come down,

4
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:25,910
first of all, in this great land of United
States.

5
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:29,513
Now, as you know that United States
or America,

6
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:34,355
the whole of it, is the Vishuddhi chakra.

7
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:42,025
Out of which, we have three sides
to the Vishuddhi chakra.

8
00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:49,818
So, the central part of the Vishuddhi
chakra is United States.

9
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:56,404
The central part of the Vishuddhi chakra
is governed by Shri Krishna.

10
00:00:56,605 --> 00:01:00,178
And His power is Radha.

11
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:07,210
“RA – DHA”. “RA” means energy, “DHA” is
the one who has sustained the energy.

12
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:10,791
“RA – DHA”. “dha-re-ti-saa”.

13
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:15,824
So, she’s the one who has sustained
the energy,

14
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:21,494
and so, she’s called as Radha. She’s
the power of Shri Krishna.

15
00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:26,579
The word Krishna comes from the word –
Krishi, means –

16
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,594
the ploughing, or you can say, agriculture
is called as “Krishi”.

17
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:40,983
The one who ploughs and puts the seed
in the soil, is doing the krishi.

18
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:45,076
And, that’s why he’s called as Krishna.

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:55,784
Now, the seed that he has sown, is the seed
of spirituality.

20
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:59,567
It is Shri Krishna who said, in Sanskrit –

21
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:03,904
“Nainam chindanti shastrani
nainam dahati pavakah

22
00:02:04,105 --> 00:02:09,481
na chainam kledayanty apo
na shoshayati marutah”

23
00:02:09,682 --> 00:02:13,621
meaning – it cannot be, means,
the spiritual life

24
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:18,193
or you can say, the eternal life, or
the Spirit,

25
00:02:18,394 --> 00:02:23,446
cannot be killed by anything, by any
weapon,

26
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:26,830
neither can be blown away by air,

27
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:32,112
nor can it be sucked in, nor can it be
destroyed.

28
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:35,323
So, to prove that, Christ came on this
earth,

29
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:41,275
and through His resurrection he proved,
what Shri Krishna has said.

30
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:44,341
And most of you sahaj yogis know
the relationship

31
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:47,712
of Christ and Shri Krishna – why he was
called Christ.

32
00:02:47,913 --> 00:02:51,830
Christ word comes from the same – Krishna.

33
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:57,036
And, his first name comes from the word
Yashoda.

34
00:02:57,237 --> 00:03:00,175
Yashoda is also called as Jesu or Yesu.

35
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:09,733
And that’s why (Krish) Christ was called
as Je-su or Ye-su.

36
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:12,849
Some people call him Yesu, and some people
call him as Jesu,

37
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,259
because of Yashoda (the mother), the foster
mother of Shri Krishna.

38
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:23,038
Also, you know that Radha was the same
as Mahalakshmi,

39
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:30,894
so she was the same as the mother
of Christ, Mary.

40
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:34,118
These, all these things we can prove it
in Sahaj Yoga.

41
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,431
Because, when the Kundalini moves up
to the Vishuddhi chakra,

42
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:43,010
and if it stops there, you can ask
the question –

43
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:46,525
“Was Krishna the son of mother Mary?

44
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:51,323
(She corrects Herself) Was Jesus the son
of mother Mary?

45
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:58,864
Who was the son of Ra, was the same
as Radha?”

46
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:00,850
And then the Kundalini moves.

47
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:06,483
So, Sahaja Yoga today is the thing which
proves what has been said so far.

48
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:10,793
It proves. It’s not just a cock and bull
story.

49
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:13,864
Because people do not believe into all
these things.

50
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:16,508
They think that it’s all cock and bull
story. Who was Christ?

51
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,101
Who was Krishna? Who was Radha? After all,
there was no God.

52
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:26,838
But only in Sahaja Yoga, today, we can
prove it, that what we say is the truth.

53
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:32,370
Because, as through realisation, you get
connected to the mains,

54
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:36,783
your vibrations start flowing,

55
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:39,881
like the computer, you start working.

56
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:42,511
And whatever question you ask,

57
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:45,414
answer comes to you as tremendous
vibrations,

58
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:49,296
or it stops or you might get heat or you
may get blisters.

59
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:56,723
So, the whole message is communicated
to you through your fingertips.

60
00:04:56,924 --> 00:04:59,219
As Mohammad Saheb has very clearly said,

61
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:04,581
that “At the time of resurrection, your
hands will speak”.

62
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:08,331
But the Muslims do not want to talk about
resurrection at all.

63
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:11,994
Because, they want to frighten people
with the doomsday.

64
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:15,604
They don’t want to talk about the
resurrection time which is going to come,

65
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:17,365
which is the intermediary time.

66
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:22,648
Because they want to use the time, which
will frighten people

67
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:25,945
by saying that, “Now your doomsday
is coming”.

68
00:05:26,146 --> 00:05:29,237
Now, your doomsday is coming, so everybody
is frightened about God

69
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:31,992
and they think that now we should just
wait for our doom,

70
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:35,138
nothing else is in between.

71
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:39,365
So, this is how the Vishuddhi chakra is
a special one.

72
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:46,053
Now Vishuddhi chakra was created
on the Saturday.

73
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:51,901
So, it is the Saturn – that’s the important
star of the Vishuddhi chakra.

74
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,699
So, whenever the Saturn is at the highest,

75
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,233
America will be in a better place to do
things.

76
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:04,899
But I don’t think they know much about
themselves.

77
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,809
They don’t know what they are, why they
are on this earth,

78
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,650
what is their work, what they are supposed
to do,

79
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:15,800
or what is the purpose of God of creating
America.

80
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:21,880
The first job of the Vishuddhi chakra
within us was that,

81
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,604
when we became human beings, we raised
our heads up like that.

82
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:29,513
When you raised your head up like that,

83
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:33,857
you have become a human being, in the sense
that now,

84
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:37,027
there is a new movement in your
consciousness.

85
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:43,477
Now the new movement in your consciousness
started about 6000 years back

86
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:46,626
when Shri Krishna came on this earth.

87
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:50,757
That the new movement was, that it is
the Father.

88
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:55,924
The advent of the Father was celebrated,
and that’s how

89
00:06:56,125 --> 00:07:04,098
people developed a kind of a new instrument
within themselves, called ego.

90
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,387
When the brain was lifted like this
you see,

91
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:13,400
it expanded in a pyramidical – it’s
a pyramid – it became a pyramid.

92
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:17,905
In an animal, the brain is flat. And,
gradually it rises.

93
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:20,969
When the head was raised, when
the responsibility was taken

94
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:24,078
of raising the head, the brain started
growing

95
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,590
in such a way that it became a pyramid.
And when it became a pyramid,

96
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,024
he attention became a different attention
from that of animal.

97
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:39,548
Because, when the waves of your
consciousness

98
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:46,100
fell on the sides of the pyramid, they went
into the parallelogram of forces,

99
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:51,980
by which the resultant force –
the resultant force…

100
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:57,203
Now, it falls like this, goes like that,
the resultant force is like that –

101
00:07:57,404 --> 00:08:01,944
had two sides – one was this, another
was this.

102
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:05,122
So, the consciousness, or we can say,
the attention –

103
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:09,595
instead of going inside, started going
outward.

104
00:08:09,796 --> 00:08:12,757
So, one part of the resultant was going
outside

105
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:18,356
and that’s how, when you became a human
being, your attention went outside.

106
00:08:18,557 --> 00:08:23,118
Are the human beings only, who have their
attention outside.

107
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,184
Not that the animals don’t have,

108
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:31,817
but the attention of human beings are such
that they create reactions.

109
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:35,734
Like, you see something.

110
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:39,142
Now, I see Doctor’s house say for example,

111
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:44,043
then a reaction starts in my mind – what is
this, what does this mean,

112
00:08:44,244 --> 00:08:47,977
how much it must have cost, from where
did he buy it!

113
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:50,996
Anything you see, it starts giving you
a reaction.

114
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,086
Not to the animals. Animals, at the most
they will say –

115
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:58,178
this I must eat, that I must eat, that
I must get.

116
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:01,260
But, they do not think about it.

117
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:04,391
It’s only the human beings who reflect.

118
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:11,883
And this reflection comes because of the
pyramid-like structure of the brain.

119
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:17,549
And this has a special reaction in
the brain itself,

120
00:09:17,797 --> 00:09:21,798
that we start developing our own ego,

121
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:25,556
our own myths, our own mental projections.

122
00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:29,004
And when we develop our own mental
projections,

123
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:32,595
this ego starts developing, “I know”
“what’s wrong”,

124
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:34,836
all these nonsensical things come.

125
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:39,682
And once that starts working out,
the balloon of the ego starts rising.

126
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:43,297
It starts pushing the other balloon which
was within us,

127
00:09:43,497 --> 00:09:45,499
is of the superego – as an animal.

128
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,157
And then, comes up in the centre.

129
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:52,816
That’s how we now become normal human
beings.

130
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:57,027
But then we start increasing our ego.

131
00:09:57,228 --> 00:10:02,279
It starts overlapping the superego,

132
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,697
and a calcification takes place, by which
we develop our I-ness.

133
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:15,223
So, it is all the happening that takes
place after we have lifted our head,

134
00:10:15,424 --> 00:10:19,820
raised our head, and we are no more
like animals.

135
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:24,374
So, Vishuddhi chakra has a very big part
to play

136
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:29,757
in the human evolution, that by developing
your Vishuddhi chakra,

137
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:34,748
you have become human beings, first of all.

138
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:40,827
 Secondly, because it is the chakra
of the Father,

139
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:49,329
who becomes again, the primordial – as you
call it in…,

140
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:53,785


141
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:58,646
macrocosm. You become the macrocosm.

142
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:04,837
You are the microcosm, and the Father
is the macrocosm.

143
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:09,174
So, you become that because of
the Vishuddhi chakra,

144
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,597
which is governed by Shri Krishna,

145
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:15,872
who becomes that macrocosm, called
as Virat.

146
00:11:16,073 --> 00:11:22,196
In the brain it is expressed in this part.
In this part of the head.

147
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:26,996
It is here that you start manifesting

148
00:11:27,197 --> 00:11:33,190
your macrocosm qualities – at this point.

149
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:36,529
Now, this Vishuddhi chakra has
a speciality – is that,

150
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,117
we always say that the responsibility
on my shoulders.

151
00:11:40,318 --> 00:11:43,852
Always we say that – the responsibilities
are on my shoulders.

152
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:50,034
The reason is, the Vishuddhi chakra gives
you the sense of responsibility.

153
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:54,663
And that’s why you know, the Americans
feel responsible for the whole world.

154
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:57,472
Naturally!

155
00:11:58,323 --> 00:12:03,096
It’s perfectly understood, that they feel
responsible for the whole world.

156
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:10,479
But how much they are aware of their role

157
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,250
as the responsible people, that’s
a different point.

158
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:16,380
But they feel they are responsible,

159
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:22,036
but their role, as responsible people,
if they understand,

160
00:12:22,237 --> 00:12:26,566
then they have to be ideals. Ideals.

161
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:30,427
Because a person who is a responsible
person in a family,

162
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:33,207
has to be the ideal for others.

163
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:35,320
It started very well, I should say,

164
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,911
at the time of Abraham Lincoln. It started
very well.

165
00:12:39,112 --> 00:12:42,066
When you started talking about democracy,
is also –

166
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:45,148
democracy is nothing but collectivity.

167
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:50,512
He started talking about collectivity
of the people, by the people.

168
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:53,437
All that shows that the sense
of collectivity

169
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:58,185
started coming right in this Vishuddhi
chakra.

170
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:08,109
But then, people who are in the centre,
can only remain normal.

171
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,949
But those who bend too much, or who
bend backward too much,

172
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,395
both suffer from problems.

173
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:22,505
The ones who bend forward to others, are
the people who get their superego.

174
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:26,557
They get over-humbled-down, like
developing countries are.

175
00:13:26,758 --> 00:13:30,771
And those who bend backward, are the people

176
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:35,956
who try to dominate others; who have ego.

177
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:44,163
So, because of sudden blessings of God,
they discovered so many things,

178
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:48,073
the ego started developing in America
too much.

179
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:51,457
But ego is like a balloon, as I told you.

180
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:55,015
And, keeps you floating in the air.

181
00:13:55,216 --> 00:13:58,703
And when you are in the air, you become
shallow people.

182
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:02,017
You have no moorings.

183
00:14:02,371 --> 00:14:06,702
But it has one more advantage, if you knew
you are floating in the air,

184
00:14:06,903 --> 00:14:10,308
you can have a complete comprehensive view.

185
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:16,071
Complete vision of the Whole, if your eyes
are pure

186
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,843
and your intentions are clear-cut.

187
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:27,438
Now (the) another thing that happens
by their coming here, was the problem,

188
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,531
that they felt that – we are a very new
nation.

189
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:36,519
It has an advantage, as well as, it has
a disadvantage.

190
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,866
The advantage is that if you are new,
it’s very good

191
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:46,070
because you can be transformed into
something better very easily,

192
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,470
because there is no conditioning in your
mind.

193
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:59,150
You are very clean, absolutely ready,
to become something great.

194
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:03,677
Or else, can be possibility that, you are
so new

195
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:06,462
that you are awed by everything that is
old,

196
00:15:06,663 --> 00:15:09,593
which is very true about Americans, that
they bought

197
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:15,085
all the old bridges from England to bring
them down here.

198
00:15:15,286 --> 00:15:18,525
And the cravings about the old is too much
here.

199
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:21,274
And that, as if whatever is new, is all
absurd.

200
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:24,381
So, maybe even Sahaja Yoga may be
an absurd thing for them.

201
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:28,799
Because according to them, this is
something new.

202
00:15:31,923 --> 00:15:36,655
Because they are new nations, they have
started discarding all that is new.

203
00:15:36,856 --> 00:15:39,125
Is an absurd thing.

204
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:42,606
Now, we must say that Sahaja Yoga,
as it is today,

205
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:47,614
is the most ancient thing. It started
with the universe

206
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:53,752
and now the culmination point has come,
because it is a living process.

207
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:58,318
As you see a flower on the tree, it’s
the first new flower.

208
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:04,371
But the flower has come out of a seed,
which has got the roots,

209
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:09,009
then it became the trunk, then it became
the leaves,

210
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,903
and then it has now become a flower.

211
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:16,782
So, though it looks a new flower, it has
a big heritage.

212
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:22,581
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is as ancient
as this universe is.

213
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:28,884
But to people, who have such a hankering
for traditionalism,

214
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:32,123
find it difficult to find out what is real
tradition.

215
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:37,589
Only those who are traditional people,
can know what is real tradition.

216
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,911
Last time I came here, in America, and
I was shocked

217
00:16:41,112 --> 00:16:44,478
that a person came to interview me.

218
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:48,968
And when he was talking, he asked about
one gentleman

219
00:16:49,169 --> 00:16:52,327
who was most untraditional from Indian
point of view.

220
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:54,908
His name was Ramakrishna Paramhamsa.

221
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:57,468
He married a woman and made her a mother.

222
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:00,480
I mean, [it’s ..] nobody has done it.
Rama has not done it.

223
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:04,204
Krishna has not done it. It’s an absurd
stuff.

224
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:07,048
But for them, he was the most traditional
man.

225
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:09,809
And he told me that, “Mother your Sahaja
Yoga is not traditional

226
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,340
if you don’t believe in Ramakrishna”.

227
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:17,679
Last fifty-sixty years, all such neo-
traditional people came up.

228
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:24,375
Another one was this Pondicherry fellow.
Another absurd situation.

229
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:29,215
He called this woman a mother, and his
relation with her is ambiguous.

230
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,487
You don’t know what relationship they had.

231
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:35,645
I mean that is something, in Indian
tradition, is an impossible situation.

232
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,630
You have to have clear-cut relationship
with everyone.

233
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:40,511
You cannot have ambiguous.

234
00:17:40,712 --> 00:17:44,175
Neither a friend, nor a wife, nor a mother
or a sister.

235
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:48,505
That kind of a situation is most
untraditional. Is never thought of.

236
00:17:48,706 --> 00:17:51,794
I mean, you Indians can know this is
not possible.

237
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:57,673
This is an absurd situation. But, for some
people, he is traditional.

238
00:17:57,874 --> 00:18:02,540
What happened, about sixty years back,
I think about the time of my birth only,

239
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:09,979
the negativity started taking a new form
in understanding the western confusion.

240
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,476
They are all westerners, if you see them.

241
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:17,974
And the western confusion they took over
for their own advantages.

242
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:20,755
They used it for their own advantages.

243
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:27,159
And this is where the western people have
failed to make them out.

244
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:32,664
The other day, at the Jungian place,
I was to talk

245
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:36,961
to Jung people with Sahaja Yoga and Jung.

246
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:40,258
Now Jung, I came to know only when he died,

247
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:44,795
because there was a little article about
him. I never studied psychology.

248
00:18:44,996 --> 00:18:47,903
Of course, I tried to learn some vocabulary
to talk to them.

249
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:50,936
Sometimes I thought, I may have to talk
to them also.

250
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:53,361
But these Jungians, all very intellectuals

251
00:18:53,562 --> 00:18:55,687
and great people sitting before me,
you see.

252
00:18:55,888 --> 00:19:01,486
About hundred of them, the President
of American Jungian society.

253
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:04,094
I’d just gone through a book, just before
starting it,

254
00:19:04,295 --> 00:19:08,654
and I saw some diagrams which really
puzzled me.

255
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:12,563
The first conception they had - of course
it’s all mental conception of Jung.

256
00:19:12,764 --> 00:19:15,400
I don’t blame him because he got
realisation

257
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:17,839
but he did not know how the stage was
created,

258
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,876
was what the framework of the stage
and his movement

259
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:26,825
was still of a seeker to find out how
he got his realization.

260
00:19:27,026 --> 00:19:30,240
And, all movements were linear. They
were not expanding

261
00:19:30,441 --> 00:19:33,950
from one point all over. So, it was not
so integrated.

262
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:37,210
Now, the thing they showed was that
at the bottom of it

263
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:40,265
was the unconscious, which is never going
to be conscious.

264
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:46,036
On top of that was the (conscious)
unconscious that can be conscious.

265
00:19:46,237 --> 00:19:50,524
Then, there was subconscious and on top
of that was the ego.

266
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:54,488
I mean what a mess of a thing it was
I tell you.

267
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:59,192
I told them, see, now the word unconscious
itself is confusing.

268
00:19:59,393 --> 00:20:01,034
What do you mean by unconscious?

269
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:05,881
Whatever you don’t feel on your central
nervous system is unconscious – alright.

270
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:10,791
But, what does that mean? We don’t feel
the subconscious.

271
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:14,540
Then, subconscious is also unconscious.

272
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:18,442
Whatever we don’t feel – for example,
there are certain sounds

273
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:21,763
of certain frequencies we don’t hear
at all.

274
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:25,577
We hear whatever is tolerable to us
as human beings.

275
00:20:25,778 --> 00:20:29,757
That you all scientists know. We don’t
hear everything.

276
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:34,110
So, all that is unconscious – means it’s
a mixed bag.

277
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:36,572
All sorts of things mixed up together.

278
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:42,667
But God is not a hodge podge person, you
see. He is a clear-cut gentleman.

279
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,901
He knows what he is doing. He is
the greatest organiser.

280
00:20:46,102 --> 00:20:50,708
And, how can he put you into a bag like
that – that the unconscious is below,

281
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:54,250
then on top of it is the unconscious that
is going to be conscious,

282
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:57,816
on top of it is the subconscious, on top
of the consciousness,

283
00:20:58,017 --> 00:21:00,168
on top of that the ego!

284
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:04,310
So you go down, carrying all this inside
you

285
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:08,432
and where do you go? And how do you go?

286
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:14,339
So, the first mistake was that there are
layers one on top of another –

287
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:19,709
it’s not so. They are placed vertically.

288
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:25,125
The ego is on the right-hand side and
superego on the left-hand side.

289
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:29,954
The future on the right-hand side and
the past on the left-hand side.

290
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,585
So, the subconscious on the left-hand side

291
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:35,102
and the supraconscious on the right-hand
side.

292
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:40,249
And the central path is kept clear cut.
I mean, in any organisation,

293
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,279
 say if you go to the airport, do you have
like this,

294
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,084
that you have to pass through the walls
to go to the aeroplane?

295
00:21:48,285 --> 00:21:51,827
If we human beings don’t commit such
horrible mistakes,

296
00:21:52,028 --> 00:21:54,479
how can God commit such a mistake?

297
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,762
So, it was absolutely wrong to think that
way.

298
00:21:57,963 --> 00:22:00,956
So, the central path is in the centre,

299
00:22:01,157 --> 00:22:05,547
while the right side is on the right side
and the left side on the left side.

300
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:08,615
And you don’t have to go to
the subconscious at all.

301
00:22:08,816 --> 00:22:13,015
Because they justified all these people
who are trying to make them hypnosis

302
00:22:13,216 --> 00:22:15,615
or they are trying to hypnotise them

303
00:22:15,816 --> 00:22:19,698
or to give them a new type of a – sort
of an experience –

304
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:21,874
all that was unconscious, we should accept.

305
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:25,759
Even some people if they start suddenly
jumping, they say – oh, it’s great.

306
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,970
So, the sensations that you get from
the subconscious

307
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:32,378
and the supraconscious were accepted
as something great.

308
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:36,889
It was a confusion of your intellectuals
I should say. Complete.

309
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,447
But it is not so.

310
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:43,357
Your path is straightforward. Absolutely
for Kundalini.

311
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:48,913
Only thing, the One who has to raise it
had to come – that’s all.

312
00:22:50,056 --> 00:22:51,889
But otherwise, it’s all very well,

313
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:56,577
and there is no need for you to get
into that horrible subconscious.

314
00:22:56,778 --> 00:22:58,970
When I told them, they were amazed.
They said – Mother, it is so simple.

315
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,061
I said – it’s very simple. Your
unconscious is divided into four.

316
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:05,874
One is the collective subconscious,

317
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:09,083
one is the collective supraconscious,

318
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:12,214
one is – you can say – the collective hell,

319
00:23:12,415 --> 00:23:19,823
and on top is the super collective
consciousness.

320
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:23,089
So where do we have to go? We should
know our destination.

321
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,584
Then we have to reach.

322
00:23:25,785 --> 00:23:30,861
And that is how the problem of all these
people getting entangled

323
00:23:31,062 --> 00:23:32,849
with Muktanand. Yesterday they asked
me a question –

324
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,190
“What is wrong with Muktanand? Why is he
so dangerous?”

325
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:39,585
One lady, poor thing, as Sahaj would have
it, she came, she said –

326
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:42,883
“Oh, I went there, I broke my back and
I’m finished once and for all.

327
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:45,663
He’s such a dangerous man. He flattered me.
I went there

328
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:48,298
and I don’t know what has happened
to my back. I can’t sit

329
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:50,866
for more than ten minutes in one place.
I have to get up.

330
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:54,313
And I have a vibrator, I have to always
put it like that”.

331
00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:57,671
So, I said, “See, the dangers”.

332
00:23:57,884 --> 00:24:00,192
Then the another theory they started that
we must suffer

333
00:24:00,393 --> 00:24:02,666
if we have to go to God. Why?

334
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:06,954
I mean that’s not God’s idea by any chance.
Why should you suffer?

335
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,023
 He made Christ suffer for you – finished
now.

336
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:12,298
Now you better not suffer. There’s no need
to suffer at all.

337
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:17,776
So, all these ideas penetrated into these
western people.

338
00:24:17,977 --> 00:24:20,705
And these mental projections they accepted

339
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:24,973
without even understanding what is written
in other books. We should see.

340
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:27,873
And they could only go as far as those
sixty years

341
00:24:28,074 --> 00:24:31,821
when these horrible people who went
to India, very shallow people,

342
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:34,418
they saw some of these tantric books,
because they wanted

343
00:24:34,618 --> 00:24:37,859
to justify Freud through Indian culture.

344
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,696
So, they got the tantrikas, erotic things
and all that,

345
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:44,610
and brought these books and some of them
read, I don’t know what books

346
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:47,730
to say that Kundalini is in the stomach,
somebody says in the brain.

347
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:49,636
I mean they don’t know where the Kundalini
is.

348
00:24:49,837 --> 00:24:52,243
And they are writing such big big books,
can you imagine?

349
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:54,854
Such big big books they have written.

350
00:24:55,055 --> 00:24:58,516
Now, when the books are written, every
book is not a scripture.

351
00:24:58,717 --> 00:25:02,322
But to them, if it is written in the book
you see, it’s a scripture.

352
00:25:02,523 --> 00:25:05,722
And that’s how the whole confusion started
growing on.

353
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:08,622
So, these people came down, took full
advantage of it

354
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:15,664
and now they have become great gurus
with lot of money.

355
00:25:15,865 --> 00:25:17,628
Rich people.

356
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:22,336
But now, as the hand of God is great,

357
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:33,347
one by one, they are getting out of
the heads of these people.

358
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:38,193
And now I hope a day will come when people
will see the light through.

359
00:25:38,394 --> 00:25:43,016
So the task of Sahaja Yoga is to establish
the truth within yourself.

360
00:25:43,217 --> 00:25:45,686
It is not that we can have a membership.

361
00:25:45,887 --> 00:25:48,998
We cannot have a person enrol into it.

362
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:53,853
We cannot call them as branded Sahaja
yogis.

363
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:57,014
It’s the growth of the person that is to be
seen.

364
00:25:57,215 --> 00:25:59,613
Now there are so many lectures which
I have given

365
00:25:59,814 --> 00:26:03,130
about Ritambhara Pragnya and all those
things and I think

366
00:26:03,331 --> 00:26:07,779
for every sahaja yogi it is necessary
to listen to those lectures,

367
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,697
go through it, understand them and
to meditate so that you grow.

368
00:26:12,898 --> 00:26:15,391
Because it is not a plastic thing that we
can create.

369
00:26:15,592 --> 00:26:23,845
It’s a living process of the living energy
of the living God.

370
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:26,784
And so, it has to grow within you.

371
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,429
By thinking you cannot make it grow

372
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,150
but by not thinking, you allow it to grow
more and more.

373
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:36,072
As it starts growing within you,

374
00:26:36,273 --> 00:26:39,059
then only you will realise that what
you are.

375
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,883
That’s the only way you have to reach
a state of that super consciousness

376
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:45,208
and establish yourself there.

377
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:48,307
Then only you will know what I’m talking
about.

378
00:26:48,508 --> 00:26:52,970
Now today’s puja is another thing. Now,
what is a Puja?

379
00:26:53,171 --> 00:26:54,965
Could be people say what a puja is.

380
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:58,416
Actually, yesterday I had a puja and it’s
not easy for me

381
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,763
to bear the pujas to be very frank,
you know.

382
00:27:00,963 --> 00:27:05,238
Because the vibrations are so much that
I don’t know.

383
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:08,720
And then, I went to the airport – two hours
we took out the vibrations

384
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:13,655
and put them for all the New York airport.
It was necessary.

385
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:19,285
It worked out. Because vibrations start
flowing with tremendous force

386
00:27:19,486 --> 00:27:22,495
and if you people do not absorb it,
it takes time

387
00:27:22,696 --> 00:27:28,421
for it to ooze out from my body. Makes
me rather heavy with it.

388
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:32,092
But then it oozes out, I feel better

389
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:36,262
and only thing that happens by saying
the mantras,

390
00:27:36,463 --> 00:27:42,308
you awaken the deities within yourself
and start receiving the vibrations.

391
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:46,471
And when your deities are awakened,
they are awakened

392
00:27:46,672 --> 00:27:49,744
through the power of the deities within me.

393
00:27:49,945 --> 00:27:51,685
They have to work very hard to do that,

394
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:54,550
and that’s how they emit too much
vibrations

395
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:58,524
which must be absorbed by you when your
deities are awakened.

396
00:27:58,725 --> 00:28:03,005
That’s how it works. You cannot describe
it in words.

397
00:28:03,206 --> 00:28:07,104
You cannot tell it in words. It’s a
happening that has to take place.

398
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:09,213
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga first,

399
00:28:09,414 --> 00:28:12,339
can go little bit like that in
the beginning.

400
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,345
Gradually they settle down, come round,

401
00:28:15,546 --> 00:28:18,052
grow into it, then it becomes alright.

402
00:28:18,253 --> 00:28:21,613
Some people just shoot off in one day, and
they are there.

403
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,804
Makes no difference whatsoever.

404
00:28:24,005 --> 00:28:27,691
Because it’s a growing thing and it has
to grow.

405
00:28:27,892 --> 00:28:31,028
With some people, the land is so fertile,

406
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:33,886
or maybe something, that it just works
out fast.

407
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,992
So, nobody should blame anyone.

408
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:38,073
And specially, one should not feel guilty

409
00:28:38,273 --> 00:28:41,013
because that’s the Vishuddhi on the
left-hand side.

410
00:28:41,214 --> 00:28:47,076
Specially for America, I’m wearing this
stone which is called as the black sapphire.

411
00:28:47,284 --> 00:28:52,151
Because, this is the stone of Shri Krishna.
It’s the stone of Vishuddhi chakra.

412
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,742
Every chakra has a stone.

413
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:56,837
And this is the stone of the Vishuddhi
chakra,

414
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,088
so I’m wearing this, just for coming
to America.

415
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:14,394
And, I hope that today’s worship will bring
out the potential of this country

416
00:29:14,595 --> 00:29:21,684
by exciting the deities, Shri Krishna
himself, who is in charge.

417
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:26,593
By pleasing him. By making him active.

418
00:29:26,794 --> 00:29:30,894
And, He has great qualities, and one
of the greatest qualities He has

419
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:35,167
that He has the samhara shakti, by which
He can kill the demons.

420
00:29:35,368 --> 00:29:40,004
And, all those demons who are settled down
here, are really mistaken.

421
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:43,056
Because, if this is the place of
Shri Krishna,

422
00:29:43,257 --> 00:29:46,083
they are very dangerously placed.

423
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:50,478
Because once He is awakened here, they all
will be completely finished

424
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:53,274
through his sudarshan chakra, which He has
in his hand

425
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:56,148
and He can just kill them one by one.

426
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:59,859
But first He’s to be pleased, and He’s
to be awakened,

427
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:04,413
He has to be “prasanna”. That’s the word.

428
00:30:04,614 --> 00:30:07,955
Prasanna means, to be pleased. And then,
it works out.

429
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:10,576
So today first we will have Ganesha’s
puja, little bit,

430
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:16,717
because Ganesha’s puja is meant just
to establish the innocence.

431
00:30:16,918 --> 00:30:19,356
The innocence of the place.

432
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:21,707
Once the innocence is established, that’s
the most important.

433
00:30:21,908 --> 00:30:24,559
That’s the essence of everything. Ganesha
is the essence.

434
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,815
And, then we will have Shri Krishna puja

435
00:30:27,015 --> 00:30:32,318
and then the puja of the Devi,
of the Power.

436
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:35,360
So, that’s how we’ll have three pujas –
one after another,

437
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:39,801
but a short time every time. Alright?
