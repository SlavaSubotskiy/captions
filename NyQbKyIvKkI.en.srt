1
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:07,690
For ascent it’s not a mental procedure,

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:17,260
it’s a procedure of the heart which is thanksgiving.

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,000
Look at the flowers,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,080
they are 
giving thanks to God.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,280
The whole being is nothing but thanksgiving!

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,960
Not worried, they are being plucked, they 
will die tomorrow – not worried.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,540
As long as they live it’s giving thanks.

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:44,100
Look at everything, look at this candle, what 
is it?

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,060
Is thanksgiving.

10
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:55,230
Everything that is created is giving thanks.

11
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,420
What about us human beings?

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:10,980
We say, because we can say it, they cannot 
say.

13
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,820
It doesn’t have words to say.

14
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:21,639
We have language, that’s how we have become 
superficial,

15
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:26,639
we have lost our depth because we have language.

16
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,960
There is no language for the silent expression.
