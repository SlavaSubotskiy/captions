1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:19,410
Today's puja is very important for us.

2
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,900
You all have got your Self Realization.

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:31,910
You have all the knowledge that is necessary 
to give Realizations to others.

4
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:37,770
You have to know what you have already.

5
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:45,730
That's very important, because if you do not 
try your hand and if you do not try to give

6
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:53,360
Realizations to others, firstly you'll have 
no faith in yourself.

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,060
You'll have no self-esteem also.

8
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:09,950
The second part is that you try giving vibrations 
to other persons, but don't get involved with

9
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,450
that person.

10
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,370
I've seen some people get too much involved.

11
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:21,040
If they give Realization to one person, they 
think they have done a great job and they

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,040
start working on that person, his family, 
his relations, this thing.

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,490
So, so far as you must have learned, that 
one may be related, one may be closer to one

14
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:49,810
person, but not necessarily he will have that 
much of chance of Self Realization.

15
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,240
Only way to grow is to be collective.

16
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,159
There's no other way out.

17
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,960
If people think that by staying away from 
ashrams, alone living somewhere they will

18
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,759
achieve much - that's not the way Sahaja Yoga 
is meant.

19
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:16,390
Formerly, people used to go to Himalayas and 
most of them were separated and only one or

20
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,840
two persons were chosen for spiritual growth.

21
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:29,310
Here it is not question of spiritual growth, 
it's a question of your collectivity growing

22
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,650
in you.

23
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:41,680
That is how you become a person who is collective, 
who enjoys collective, who works on collective

24
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,200
and lives with collective.

25
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:51,810
Such a person develops new kind of powers.

26
00:02:51,810 --> 00:03:06,099
And these powers are such that they are very 
subtle, but they penetrate into any molecule,

27
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:11,860
atom or human beings, anywhere.

28
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:19,989
And their penetration is only possible if 
you have a temperament which is collective.

29
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:30,269
Without being fully collective, you cannot 
achieve that height which is very necessary

30
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:32,430
today for Sahaja Yoga.

31
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:40,410
As you know, there are problems and problems 
all over, as if you feel that the world is

32
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,510
going to sink.

33
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:48,300
Specially when I went to America I felt that 
"My goodness, this is a hell that they have

34
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,340
created here."

35
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:56,440
Is just a hell because they have no dharma, 
they don't believe in any dharma, completely

36
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:03,959
they worship adharma and this kind of climate 
is flowing all over.

37
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:11,590
All over the world, you get reaction of American 
adharmic life.

38
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,849
And people think there's nothing wrong in 
it.

39
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:20,650
Whatever you may tell them, they will not 
believe nor they will think that there's any

40
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,650
verdict.

41
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:29,099
But they don't see the destruction from the 
very basis of their life, their families,

42
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:31,490
their societies.

43
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:42,099
The whole country, I feel, is filled with 
such ugly type of adharmic nature, that one

44
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:49,120
cannot even imagine how such ideas came into 
their heads.

45
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,110
And these ideas I need not tell you, you know 
them very well.

46
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:59,600
But if you have to save your children, you 
have to be an ideal guru yourself.

47
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:10,169
If you just talk of Sahaja Yoga and if you 
try to assume that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

48
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:16,740
also you try to propagate Sahaja Yoga without 
all these powers being awakened in you, it

49
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,689
would be a failure.

50
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:29,430
So, how to develop these powers within us 
we should see.

51
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,069
It's rather embarrassing for Me to tell you 
how you have to behave towards your Guru.

52
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,979
I think people have told you.

53
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:44,840
But naturally, spontaneously, as soon as you 
get your Realization and grow in it, naturally

54
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,199
you develop a very humble attitude.

55
00:05:48,199 --> 00:06:02,719
Also an attitude through which you achieve 
lots of

56
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,000
qualities of your Guru.

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,300
Now, supposing the Guru is at a particular 
height and if you try to go on to the same

58
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,909
height, nothing will move towards you.

59
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:24,129
So you must sit at a place which is much lower 
than the Guru's is.

60
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:30,550
Some people take too much advantage of My 
good nature, I should say, and so many people

61
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,732
have pointed out to Me that "You must correct 
these people, they talk to You at equal level

62
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:35,732
and all that."

63
00:06:35,732 --> 00:06:40,189
I said: "They will learn a lesson, they will 
learn a lesson."

64
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:47,029
But sometimes, it doesn't work out and they 
start talking on the same manner as if you

65
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:51,870
are talking to your friend or to your equal.

66
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,780
First is complete humility.

67
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,839
You have to be a humble person, extremely 
humble.

68
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:08,229
Now, you check on that, when you talk to others, 
are you humble?

69
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:12,039
When you think of others, are you humble?

70
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:18,419
When you look after your wife and children, 
are you humble?

71
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:30,680
That's a very important thing for every person 
who thinks he is a Guru.

72
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,979
Humility is the first quality or, I should 
say, the ocean into which you must jump.

73
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:43,479
Some people think that "If you are humble, 
Mother, then people will take advantage of

74
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,400
you."

75
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,119
Nobody can take advantage of you, because 
you have to remember another point, that you

76
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:57,259
are protected all the time, looked after by 
Param Chaitanya.

77
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:04,999
I know you know that, but how many really 
believe that there is Param Chaitanya with

78
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:05,999
us?

79
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:14,849
If you really believe that there is Param 
Chaitanya, then you don't get frightened,

80
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:22,219
you don't get worried, you are not subjected 
to all kinds of nonsensical ideas also.

81
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:27,929
But if you think that you are not protected, 
"What will happen?

82
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:34,839
How will things happen?" then Param Chaitanya 
leaves you alone.

83
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:49,290
You have to see the whole drama, how Param 
Chaitanya works out, how It works out, how

84
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,290
you are behaving.

85
00:08:50,290 --> 00:09:02,860
Supposing you are not in a proper shape and 
you try to show off too much, then what happens?

86
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,660
Then, you get the reward for it.

87
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,110
Not that I do anything, but it is the Param 
Chaitanya which will teach you a lesson that

88
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,389
you will remember, that you should have been 
little different from what you have been.

89
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:23,149
After all, we have to know why have we come 
to Sahaja Yoga.

90
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:25,389
Begin at the root of it.

91
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:32,930
We have come to Sahaja Yoga because we wanted 
to know the absolute truth, and this absolute

92
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:38,779
truth has been now known to you through your 
vibrations.

93
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:47,209
You know it through your vibrations, what 
is the absolute truth, and you should work

94
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:59,269
everything on that line, that absolute truth, 
whatever you feel on your vibrations you have

95
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:00,560
to follow.

96
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,540
Unfortunately, I have seen many people think 
that their vibrations are all right, they

97
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,920
are all right and whatever they are receiving 
on their vibrations is first class.

98
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,310
Now, how to correct that point is very difficult.

99
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,860
It comes from ego.

100
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,720
When you have ego, you can never find anything 
wrong with you.

101
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,170
And even if the vibrations are telling you 
something, it might be somebody else who is

102
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:33,019
telling you something, because you are not 
there, your ego is there and your ego is just

103
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:41,670
spoiling you and teaching you things which 
normally you would see clearly that "I'm doing

104
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,850
something wrong, I should not have done it."

105
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:55,439
In this process of correction and improvement, 
when you indulge you should see: "Are you

106
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:57,819
getting subtler or grosser?"

107
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:59,550
That is the best way to judge.

108
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:11,019
Now, I've seen people who go on judging on 
small things like vibrations - whether this

109
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:18,290
vibration are all right or not in this tree 
or on this flowers or on this land, all kinds

110
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,060
of material things they want to see the vibrations.

111
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,930
But for what are you seeing the vibration?

112
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:31,360
You are seeing vibration because some sort 
of material gain.

113
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,199
You think that if you check the vibrations 
and the vibrations are all right, then you

114
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:41,939
are quite safe, you will not loose this, will 
not loose that.

115
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:44,030
It's not true.

116
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:50,579
Because vibrations are not meant to judge 
all these worldly things and worldly matters.

117
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,730
It's absolutely cheapening the vibrations.

118
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:02,350
You should not cheapen them, because vibrations 
can suggest things which may be detrimental

119
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,190
to your growth very much.

120
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:11,180
Once, I wanted somebody to go somewhere, so 
he said, "I didn't go, Mother."

121
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,180
I said, "Why?"

122
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,620
"Because I saw the vibrations were very bad."

123
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,629
I said, "That's why I asked you to go.

124
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:25,180
If the vibrations were good, what was your 
use going there?

125
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,480
That's the reason I asked you to go there 
so that you could help but before that you

126
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,990
judged yourself, judged your vibrations and 
then you didn't want to go."

127
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:40,129
So, what happens, we want to have a easy, 
cozy life.

128
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:46,730
And all our problems must be solved by Sahaja 
Yoga, otherwise we think Sahaja Yoga is of

129
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,730
no use.

130
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,360
Whatever is our desire must be fulfilled.

131
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,620
So, now the desires are mostly personal.

132
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:01,290
"My child is not well, so the child should 
be all right, my husband is misbehaving, the

133
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:07,249
husband should be all right" or "I have no 
house, I must get a house."

134
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:14,790
See how we are moving our mind, is still on 
a very consumer society, as they call it.

135
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:22,660
We are all the time thinking, "Now I should 
have a son, now, instead of a girl" and you

136
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,509
get a son and then you blame Sahaja Yoga for 
that!

137
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:33,910
Anything that according to your desire doesn't 
work out, then you think it's Sahaja Yoga

138
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,649
which has done the harm and you are suffering 
because of Sahaja Yoga.

139
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:47,180
Or this faith in Sahaja Yoga gets little moving 
or we can say, in a way, it's not that deep.

140
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:56,279
But if you are deeply imbedded in Sahaja Yoga, 
then what happens?

141
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:03,610
"What may come, I will be a Sahaja Yogi."

142
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:10,100
Supposing somebody dies, normally in Sahaja 
Yoga it's difficult for people to die also,

143
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,570
I must tell you.

144
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,600
Even if they want to die, they can't die.

145
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,519
It's the Param Chaitanya which decides for 
you.

146
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:25,790
But supposing you take up a position like 
that, still you must know that that wish may

147
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,790
not be fulfilled.

148
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:39,180
If that is not fulfilled then you feel disturbed 
and you think, "What's wrong?"

149
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:56,699
But your wish is not the wish of God Almighty, 
while Param Chaitanya is the wish of God Almighty.

150
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:00,290
Now for example I went to America, take it 
like this, and America attacked Me.

151
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,959
Negativity and troubled Me.

152
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:13,550
For all these days I'm suffering so-called, 
and I have had pain, I have had all kinds

153
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,550
of things.

154
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:21,149
But that I had to do because now the American 
Sahaja Yogis will realize how much one has

155
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:29,459
to pay to make this dumb head of Americans 
to rise.

156
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:40,019
How stupid they are and how foolish they are 
who are enamored by people who are taking

157
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,079
money!

158
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:49,779
So many people came to Me and told Me, "Mother, 
if You start saying that, this I can give

159
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:56,829
for 300 dollars, You'll get thousands and 
thousands of disciples of Yours."

160
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:00,980
I said, "They'll not be My disciples.

161
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,300
If they come for money, thinking that because 
I'm taking money it is worthy something, that

162
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,250
means they are absolutely stupid!"

163
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:16,500
Sahaja Yoga, you cannot get it by money, this 
is the first principle they don't understand,

164
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,870
most of them!

165
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:27,029
Most of them don't understand that you can 
get Self Realization without paying any money.

166
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:36,510
They were some Gujarati rich people in New 
Jersey and they asked questions to Sahaja

167
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,940
Yogis that "How is it possible to get it so 
easily?

168
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:45,920
It's not possible because it's a very difficult 
thing, all the shastras have said, everybody

169
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,470
has said, it's very difficult to get your 
Realization.

170
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,470
All right!

171
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,480
If so, how is it you are giving it so easily?

172
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,380
Why?"

173
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,170
Nobody knew how to answer to these people.

174
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:06,370
You should have said like this, "All right 
it is difficult, very difficult and you cannot

175
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,949
give mass, true!

176
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:13,949
But if somebody is doing it, then you have 
to think about it, how somebody is doing it?"

177
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:19,610
So, this kind of stupid questions are there 
and still if they go on, you have really to

178
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:25,809
tell them in a very humble way: "Sir, one 
has to be worthy also."

179
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:31,740
So, they will run after people who are just 
making money out of them, making fool out

180
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,740
of them.

181
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,290
And they boast, "We have three gurus."

182
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,880
Somebody says, "We have seven gurus!"

183
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,030
And I wonder what must be their condition.

184
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:46,130
So the people who are extremely stupid, in 
Sanskrit they call "[SOUNDS LIKE MURLE OR

185
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:54,059
MOOHL]" people who are brainless cannot get 
their Realization, so give them up.

186
00:17:54,059 --> 00:18:00,640
If they are arguing with you, you just give 
them up.

187
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,340
It's not their right to argue with you.

188
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:10,120
Their right is to get Realization but not 
a right to argue with you, ask you foolish

189
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,429
questions and stupid questions.

190
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:17,409
But you should always remember that with that 
humility you must have your dignity intact

191
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:18,780
because you are a Guru.

192
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:28,420
Once you know you are a Guru, one thing should 
be there that you will not behave like a joker

193
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,720
all the time.

194
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,679
Your behavior will be dignified.

195
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:40,520
At the same time, it will be very pleasant 
face or a pleasant personality.

196
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,040
It won't be annoying type.

197
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,840
Your personality itself will suggest that 
there's something special about you.

198
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:59,940
Now, how do you develop that kind of a personality?

199
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:07,330
The biggest problem in the West is ego and 
the biggest problem in the East is superego.

200
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:13,830
Now, this ego business, I don't know from 
where it has come.

201
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,029
In all walk of life, they show how egoistical 
they are.

202
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:25,950
For example, I went to America and I was surprised 
that there is a racial problem, and the blacks

203
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,470
are treated in a different manner, and the 
whites in a different manner.

204
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:35,390
I mean, color is given by God and somebody 
has to be black, and white.

205
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,870
If everybody looked the same, it will look 
like a regiment.

206
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:48,280
There should be some variety, there should 
be some change in the face and also in the

207
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
expression.

208
00:19:49,280 --> 00:20:00,940
One has to be a person carrying better or 
different expressions, otherwise you will

209
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,970
be bored with such a world where there is 
everybody looks the same, just the same.

210
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:14,549
But so much of racialism there that I was 
surprised that how it has worked into human

211
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:15,549
mind.

212
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:23,660
So, as a Guru, you must develop a complete 
detest for racialism, complete detest.

213
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:32,690
That's very easy to understand that anybody 
who has fair complexion could be a cruelest

214
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:38,539
man, cruelest woman and could be a cruelest 
mother also.

215
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:43,950
And the one who is black could be very kind, 
generous.

216
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:49,960
It doesn't go with the color, temperament 
doesn't go with the color.

217
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,370
But because the blacks have been ill-treated 
so much that they react.

218
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:03,510
And they react, naturally, in sometimes in 
such a manner that it is very crude and very

219
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,510
cruel.

220
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:17,429
But this kind of attention, this kind of a, 
you can say, a wrong type of attitude towards

221
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:21,769
human beings, even towards animals they won't 
bear it.

222
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:28,580
So towards human beings to have such an attitude 
itself shows that you are not worthy of Sahaja

223
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,390
Yoga at all.

224
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:41,560
So anyone of you who has such a feeling that 
somebody is black and somebody is white cannot

225
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,220
be a guru in Sahaja Yoga.

226
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,500
Then in India we have caste system, equally 
bad and horrible.

227
00:21:52,500 --> 00:22:00,679
It has no sense in it, no basis whatsoever, 
but in India we have people who believe that

228
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,419
some castes are higher and some castes are 
lower.

229
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:12,011
Every caste people can do all the worst possible 
things, there is no demarcation for them and

230
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:16,929
every low caste can be very, very good.

231
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:24,549
We have had many great poets and Sufis in 
the lowest castes in India.

232
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:26,890
This castes are man-made.

233
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:33,190
You know man-made cloth doesn't suit us, and 
all these man-made ideas are not going to

234
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:42,039
suit us and it will lead us into a great - I 
wouldn't know discretion - but I would say

235
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:53,309
to a complete destruction, because hatred 
begets hatred and it goes on increasing and

236
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:54,309
increasing.

237
00:22:54,309 --> 00:23:00,260
If you cannot get rid of your hatred, then, 
I would say you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

238
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,700
These are all conditionings.

239
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:13,299
You were born in a white family, so you are 
white, you were born in a Christian family

240
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:18,801
that's why you are Christian, you were born 
in a Jew family, that's why you are a Jew.

241
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:19,970
All this is just because you were born in 
that.

242
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:25,779
But does that mean that you are higher or 
lower?

243
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:32,779
All the problems of the world today, if you 
see, are because of human attachment to nonsensical

244
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:35,290
ideas of superiority.

245
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:41,510
Only through collective living will change.

246
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:50,630
For example, I would say, in an ashram, we 
should have all colored people living together

247
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:58,029
with the equal rights, with the equal understanding 
and love and affection.

248
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:12,019
If that is not there, no use calling it an 
ashram.

249
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:19,090
Once, they asked Me, "Mother, will You come 
and give a lecture in Harlem?"

250
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,630
I said, "Why not?"

251
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,429
So some Sahaja Yogis said, "Harlem?

252
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:24,779
Mother, do You know what is Harlem?"

253
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:25,899
I said, "I know.

254
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:26,899
There's no harm."

255
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:30,130
They said, "You know the blacks are there 
and..."

256
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,800
I said, "I'm also black."

257
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:42,120
You could call Me black or you can call Me 
white, but the love is such a thing, you see,

258
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:48,940
love is such a thing that cleanses all these 
ridiculous ideas we have about other people.

259
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:56,300
To brand anyone as black and white shows that 
you have no eyes to see.

260
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:09,179
Any person with depth, any person with loving 
heart cannot see these superficial things,

261
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,480
cannot see!

262
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,549
Today is a day where we are celebrating the 
Guru's greatness.

263
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:28,970
Now, look at all the Gurus, how they were, 
how they behaved.

264
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:34,960
We have many in India and many others many 
Sufis in other countries.

265
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:44,200
These Sufis or these saints that we had never 
believed in any caste system, never believed

266
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,070
in black and white.

267
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,120
Christ, He never believed in black and white.

268
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,070
Buddha never believed in black and white.

269
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:03,360
Nobody believed in any kind of man-made ideas.

270
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:12,679
These are all man-made ideas which we have 
accepted and, even after Realization, which

271
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,710
I have to carry all the time.

272
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:23,740
Now, by saying, we do not get rid of it, but 
acting we can.

273
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:35,159
Just see how we work out these stupid ideas 
within us and how we can get rid of them.

274
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:45,690
Very simple is in meditation you should sit 
down and see how many people you love and

275
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:56,120
why do you love, not out of pity, but just 
with love, how much you care for others.

276
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:02,880
I've seen some very beautiful examples of 
that, but still I must say that there are

277
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:10,650
certain fixed ideas which are to be dislodged 
completely, very important for every person

278
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,400
who is a Guru in Sahaja Yoga.

279
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,940
Means he has to be a clean-hearted, open-hearted, 
loving-hearted fellow.

280
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:23,830
His heart should play the tune of Param Chaitanya.

281
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:32,600
If his heart is full of all these man-made 
ideas, I don't know what will happen.

282
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:39,830
Even when they transplant the heart, they 
cannot do it with a man-made, they have to

283
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,850
use a real, natural one.

284
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:54,149
So you can imagine when you try to take to 
all these odd ideas, are just divisive, they

285
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:57,770
will never give you collectivity.

286
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,500
So, introspection has to be made.

287
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:09,500
Are we one, or we are judging each other?

288
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:16,400
Now, the judgment is quite a lot also.

289
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:27,290
Now, all this can be seen only when you live 
together, otherwise how will you know?

290
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:36,330
When you start living together, you discover, 
start discovering what is missing in you,

291
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,679
what is not there, what has to be there.

292
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:49,520
It is so peaceful to have a heart which is 
full of love because every movement of that

293
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,740
heart is so much joy giving, so much joy giving.

294
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:09,850
There's a story of Shri Rama, that He ate 
the bers, a kind of fruit, which were first

295
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:14,260
tasted by an old lady with such love.

296
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,380
Shows what?

297
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:24,480
Shows that a person like Shri Ram Who was 
the King of the highest heritage and this

298
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:33,291
old lady who was just of the lowest caste 
gives Him these fruits with such love, and

299
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:36,940
when He eats that, He starts praising it.

300
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,500
So His wife says, "Give me some!"

301
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:46,080
He says, "All right," but the brother is still 
half way, I think, in Sahaja Yoga, so he doesn't

302
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,659
like, he doesn't like, he gets angry.

303
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:51,389
Then She eats and She says, "Brother-in-law, 
it's wonderful fruit, I must say!"

304
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,019
He says, "All right, give me some."

305
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:57,559
She says, "Why should I give you now?

306
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:05,070
First you were a very much angry, so why should 
I give you these fruits to eat?"

307
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:16,720
The story shows that the level of your personality 
as Guru is judged by your clean heart, by

308
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:26,480
your loving heart, by your highest, remarkable 
personality.

309
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,019
In the personality it is not something that 
is to be built-in artificially.

310
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:38,859
It is not artificial; it is natural, absolutely 
natural.

311
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:43,779
Whatever you do has to be natural.

312
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:52,720
So, this artificiality of certain ways of 
talking or certain ways of living together

313
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,070
creates problem.

314
00:30:54,070 --> 00:31:02,799
For example, we had a ashram in America, in 
New York, and there was a lady who was very

315
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:10,009
strict, everything should be tip-top, it should 
be here, the spoons must be there and the

316
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:14,610
forks should be here, and all sort of things 
and she hurt many people.

317
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,610
Not important.

318
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:25,200
These cultural, what you can call it, the 
taboos are not important in Sahaja Yoga, because

319
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,049
now, you have become a Guru.

320
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:33,549
Guru can stay anywhere, live anywhere, eat 
anything, any time.

321
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:35,090
That should be the case.

322
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:43,720
But also I've seen in Sahaja Yoga, there are 
many who are very anxious to eat food as soon

323
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,090
as it is served.

324
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:50,299
Once it happened, I was there, they had served 
the food and just they started removing the

325
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:51,299
plates.

326
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:52,419
I said, "What's the matter, I have to eat."

327
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:53,419
"Oh!

328
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:54,419
You haven't eaten, Mother?"

329
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,799
"No, I haven't yet touched it even."

330
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:06,909
So, you see, sort of, first it is the very 
lowest type of, we should say, desire, is

331
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:07,909
the hunger.

332
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:10,710
Now, a Guru doesn't bother.

333
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:15,770
Whatever you give, all right, whatever he 
wants not to give, all right.

334
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:23,600
Even if you don't give is all right, but one 
has to develop that by killing your ego.

335
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,970
People feel very hurt if you serve them little 
later than another person.

336
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:35,750
It's all kinds of funny things I've seen in 
Sahaja Yoga.

337
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:43,029
On the contrary it is the lowest type of, 
I should say, a desire.

338
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:49,940
You should not be very much catered to, if 
you want to be a real Guru.

339
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:59,769
Of course, many problems are solved, as I 
have seen so far that they do not take to

340
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:07,330
drugs, they do not take to drinking and all 
such things.

341
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:11,980
You see, it's such a blessing, because if 
I had to start from that level, I don't know

342
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,980
how deep I would have gone, from where I would 
have pulled you out.

343
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,590
But that is of course a very big thing.

344
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:26,490
That is quite a nice thing but still, to make 
a beautiful life out of it which will attract

345
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:33,059
the attention of everyone - how you talk, 
how you behave, how you love.

346
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:44,110
So, again one has to say that Guru Pada comes 
only through the love that you have.

347
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:54,559
Like they'll have, say, ten people for anything, 
for a drama supposing, and they have it only

348
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:03,919
from a particular country or from a particular 
group, then there's no fun!

349
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,900
There's no fun.

350
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:11,610
For example they'll have a music group, so, 
from the particular one caste could be or

351
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:21,320
could be one religion, could be one, you can 
say, one school or anything.

352
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,730
So that shows that you are still not there.

353
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:38,380
As a Guru, you should like every kind of culture, 
every kind of beauty and that has to be brought

354
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,290
in, in our daily life.

355
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:52,670
You should not look down upon anyone for their 
color, for their race, for their status, class

356
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,700
consciousness.

357
00:34:53,700 --> 00:35:02,260
All this has been shown in the lives of all 
these Guru saints who lived.

358
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:08,620
Tukarama says, "Oh God, thank God you have 
made me a Shidhul caste."

359
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:15,200
He was not but he just says so.

360
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:25,690
All of us, all the time should not be conscious 
of what has been our birth, what has been

361
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:32,810
our personality or what has been our beginning.

362
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:40,810
One should not be able to make out even who 
is the saint and who is not.

363
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:46,260
Even people are proud that they are saints.

364
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:53,220
I was surprised in America, also, very much 
that the Russians who have gone there are

365
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,970
a very different quality people.

366
00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:01,530
They wouldn't raise their eyes to Me, wouldn't 
raise their eyes and very deep, very, very

367
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,530
deep.

368
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,170
Vibrations were very deep.

369
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:12,520
The reason is, I think, they have been oppressed 
during communism, perhaps, maybe, and now

370
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:19,470
they have come to America where they have 
seen so-called freedom and what nonsense it

371
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,360
is doing.

372
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:31,500
So knowing these two extremes, I think they 
have gone very deep into their own being,

373
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:40,290
and they have such strength and such unity 
among themselves.

374
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:46,950
I was surprised that I had never met them 
before.

375
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:53,160
They didn't come from Russia, they came, only 
they were there.

376
00:36:53,160 --> 00:37:05,140
So, what is it that has kept them like that 
is, that they had no religion in their heads.

377
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,520
They had no religion.

378
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:13,460
To them, every religion is the same and they 
had no religion to follow.

379
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:23,200
So, a Guru cannot belong to any religion because 
these religions are also man-made.

380
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,010
They have created such a problem all over 
and they are all fighting among themselves,

381
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:30,270
how can they be divine?

382
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:41,710
So, you should not get involved into some 
sort of a religious bias.

383
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:51,760
I've seen it, that a Sahaja Yogi, say if he 
is a Christian, then the bias will be shown

384
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,760
that he is a Christian, you can make it out.

385
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,500
If he is a Jew, you can make it out.

386
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:02,880
So what's the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

387
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:11,640
Their attention, if it goes inside they'll 
find out.

388
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:18,750
You have to dissect yourself to see what's 
wrong with you and why is it that you are

389
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:25,940
not very successful as a Guru.

390
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:36,580
The success of the Guru is: he doesn't bother 
about time.

391
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,170
Every time is the holy time.

392
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:45,690
For he's not bothered if somebody is late 
or has come early.

393
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:49,270
He is not a slave of watches and time.

394
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,750
This is also man-made.

395
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:59,920
There were no watches about, I think, three 
hundred years back and nobody was so particular

396
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,410
about the timing.

397
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:08,600
So, first thing, he is beyond time, kalatit 
as they call it.

398
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,700
Then he is also gunatit.

399
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:19,600
Gunatit means he doesn't belong to the left 
side or to the right side or to the center.

400
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:29,770
He is beyond these three, beyond these gunas 
where he stands and sees everything in the

401
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,390
Divine Light.

402
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,270
Everything!

403
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:38,380
If something good happens to him, he said, 
"The Divine Light has done."

404
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,590
If something bad happens to him, he said, 
"The Divine light wanted this way."

405
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,170
Everything he leaves for the Divine Light.

406
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,540
He is beyond the gunas.

407
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:55,340
Like, supposing there is a person who is on 
the right side - egoistical - then he'll start

408
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,690
saying, "How is it?

409
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:02,230
I wanted this, this didn't work out and how...," 
he'll challenge.

410
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:07,930
Another will start crying, the left sided 
one that "I'm very sorry this has happened

411
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,860
to me, it should not have happened" and all 
that.

412
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:19,290
In the center also, he might think that "How 
far are my vibrations, how could I not know?"

413
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,800
and all that.

414
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:29,920
But a person who is a real Guru, he looks 
at it as a drama, as a, just a witness of

415
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,920
the drama.

416
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,070
"It happened, it was to happen, so it has 
happened."

417
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,870
So, what do we get out of it?

418
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:45,110
You see we get something: the lesson that 
this was not right or this was wrong, that's

419
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,110
all.

420
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:52,540
For that moment, not to go on churning in 
your head, that's all one gets and he is not

421
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,370
bothered about anything else.

422
00:40:54,370 --> 00:41:03,530
So he goes beyond his gunas, beyond gunas 
he lives, he eats anywhere, sleeps anywhere,

423
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:10,670
he is not bothered where he lives, he is not 
bothered whether he goes by car or he goes

424
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:19,300
by bullock cart, he doesn't feel he is being 
not honored if they give him a garland of

425
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,610
few flowers.

426
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,280
It's not that.

427
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:33,770
He is not bothered, because nothing can enhance 
his personality - nothing!

428
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:43,320
You give them something simple it's all right, 
or even if you don't give, it's all right.

429
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:49,420
It's not he judges himself through your eyes, 
but he judges himself through his own eyes

430
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:55,700
and he sees for himself the joy of enjoying 
himself.

431
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:03,060
What is there to be so particular about anything?

432
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:09,250
What is so great to be hankering after anything?

433
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:16,330
It just works out in its own time and if it 
doesn't, it doesn't.

434
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,790
What does it matter?

435
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,880
Just think of it!

436
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:27,250
Also, in Sahaja Yoga, a Guru has to be a binding 
force.

437
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:38,180
There are two types of people, I've seen, 
which go on breaking relations.

438
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,330
It's very easy for them.

439
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,180
They go on complaining.

440
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:53,870
But there are others who have a power to bind 
people together in such a manner, in such

441
00:42:53,870 --> 00:43:01,890
a sweet manner that the people are brought 
closer together.

442
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:07,920
Not that they have to forgive, it automatically 
it works out.

443
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,410
Just works out like that and people go on 
joining such a man.

444
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:19,390
I was surprised that in America they were 
very, very few Sahaja Yogis.

445
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:28,640
"We spend," they said, "Fifty thousand dollars 
and got fifty Sahaja Yogis."

446
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,190
One thousand for one Sahaja Yogi in America!

447
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:42,230
So, very bad shape, but still, you see we 
have to hope for them, because there are lots

448
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:46,590
of seekers and lost in the wilderness of seeking.

449
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:53,060
But I thought that maybe it's a circle.

450
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:59,560
They have to pass through this circle of stupidity 
and then definitely they will see the point

451
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,130
and it has happened.

452
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:10,660
We had about four thousand people for My lecture 
which never has happened there in that country.

453
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:16,400
"Nobody has got such a lot of audience," they 
said.

454
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,280
But still, not many came but they got their 
Realization.

455
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,720
So, I think gradually, even in America it 
may start growing.

456
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:36,510
And the Sahaja Yogis must not only worry about 
their houses and where they live and all that,

457
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:40,540
but go all out to them.

458
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:46,240
I would say some of the Sahaja Yogis who could 
afford to go, should go to America and work

459
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,920
out this outside work.

460
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:57,450
May be if there are outsiders who come and 
talk about Sahaja Yoga, they might be impressed.

461
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:05,230
There are so many false gurus that you can't 
count them.

462
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:06,950
And they have accepted them.

463
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:12,330
It's very surprising, though they have suffered, 
they have lost in money, everything, still

464
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:16,090
they have accepted, "After all he is our guru!"

465
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:21,290
So, there is basically something wrong with 
their brains that they don't understand what

466
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:25,550
is to be expected.

467
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:26,880
I have written one book.

468
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,220
Perhaps it may reach them, but in any case 
you all can write your experiences and things

469
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,640
and can publish it.

470
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,530
Maybe it might help them to open their eyes.

471
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:44,760
While writing anything, you have to remember 
that it should show your quality of Sahaja

472
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,420
Yoga, how you are.

473
00:45:48,420 --> 00:46:02,090
In that, one should not feel that you are 
putting them down or trying to say some things

474
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:09,350
which will hurt them, but say it in such a 
manner that it corrects them and helps them.

475
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:19,330
For a Guru, it is important that he should 
not have any false ideas about himself.

476
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:25,020
He might be from a poor family, might be from 
the rich family.

477
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:28,460
Whatever it is, he should not be conscious 
of that.

478
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:35,440
Because, once you become that ... See, look 
at Kabira, he was just a weaver, look at Tridas,

479
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,250
he was just a... what you call that?

480
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,480
Shoemaker.

481
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:49,880
See, in India these are very low castes, supposed 
to be.

482
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,360
He has written beautiful poetry.

483
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:58,150
Then Namadeva, he was a tailor, just think 
of that.

484
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:06,110
All these people have written the same thing 
with such great beauty of poetry.

485
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:08,040
How have they achieved?

486
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:13,790
Because, now they have entered into that great 
realm of spirituality.

487
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:19,260
You people also write some very good poetry, 
I know.

488
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:25,420
But some of the people who have written good 
poetry turned out to be very obstinate, very

489
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,420
egoistical people.

490
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,120
This is something I couldn't understand.

491
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:33,990
You are writing here a beautiful poetry and 
here you are full of ego.

492
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:39,410
So, from where this poetry is coming, God 
knows.

493
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:47,710
So, first of all is yourself, your personality 
has to be something that people should say,

494
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:52,980
"This is the real Guru we have met."

495
00:47:52,980 --> 00:48:03,340
For that, you know very well, you don't have 
to give up your family, don't have to give

496
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,470
up anything.

497
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:15,690
But ego, if it is still there, I don't know 
what to say, but you must get rid of it completely

498
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:20,650
and collectively also, ego should be driven 
out, collectively.

499
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:27,840
It's a thing that, people are egoistical secretly 
within themselves but sometimes it shows,

500
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:36,690
it's a very subtle nonsensical disease that 
people have and they just indulge into it.

501
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:47,050
On this day of Guru Puja, I have to say now 
that one has to work very hard, very hard.

502
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:57,160
The most important thing is how much you have 
dedicated your life, your time to Sahaja Yoga.

503
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,020
Then only you will achieve that state of Guru.

504
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:10,420
Look at Me, I'm a house wife and I have my 
family's responsibilities, problems, but despite

505
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:20,620
that, I'm all the time thinking about Sahaja 
Yogis, Sahaja Yoga and all that is this emancipation

506
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:25,700
of human beings in the whole world.

507
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:30,890
Not only here or there, in the whole world.

508
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:39,070
So, that should be your widened vision, not 
for only your school, college, or university,

509
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:46,960
your this or that but a very wider vision 
one should have and that you have to develop

510
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:58,710
through your working into every type of circumstances, 
every type of problems you have.

511
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:06,110
Once you develop that kind of a personality, 
then you'll be amazed how you can help so

512
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,110
many people.

513
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:11,190
I know there are so many Sahaja Yogis here 
who are worthy of praise and really I love

514
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:23,980
them very much and they also love Me very 
much, but one should always see that, as you

515
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:33,480
are now going to be the Gurus, you have to 
be careful not to think that you are a Guru.

516
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,080
You should never think you are a guru already.

517
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:43,320
Once you start thinking again Mr. Ego, the 
guru, comes up.

518
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:51,280
So, once you decide that "I'm nothing, I'm 
nothing, I'm just a little ripple in the heart

519
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,590
of my Mother."

520
00:50:52,590 --> 00:51:00,430
If such a humble feeling you get, then, all 
your problems can be solved and things will

521
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:01,430
work out.

522
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:07,780
Because your attention and your behavior is 
going to impress other people, nothing else.

523
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:18,910
Whatever you may try, it is you who is going 
to get Sahaja Yoga further.

524
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:26,100
There is so much to be said about how to become 
a good Guru and all that but I think I'll

525
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,960
keep it for next Guru Puja.

526
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,850
Thank you very much.
