1
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:11,042
Then another thing She does, which is a very beautiful thing She does,

2
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:18,042
I think sometimes, that She creates an illusion

3
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:23,500
to test your intelligence, to test your sensibility.

4
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:28,209
She creates an illusion. Branti rupena samstita.

5
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:33,209
She makes a branti in your head. Illusion.

6
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:36,292
So you become illusive

7
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:41,167
or others become illusive or a situation becomes illusive.

8
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,250
And you are lost in it.

9
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:51,375
Then you really understand that it’s wrong thing I have done.

10
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:56,083
It’s a very nice story about Narada.

11
00:00:56,209 --> 00:01:02,167
Narada was under an impression about himself

12
00:01:02,292 --> 00:01:07,334
and ultimately he became ego-oriented and he started saying,

13
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:11,292
"Oh, look at me. I am never enticed by any woman.

14
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:16,042
Even Shiva was enticed by Cupid. I am never enticed.

15
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:21,083
I am the highest of highest, Brahmachari."

16
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:28,542
So Vishnu sent two gandharvas to entice him.

17
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:32,000
So they met him in a forest and told him,

18
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,125
"Oh, Narada, you are such a handsome man,

19
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,542
such a beautiful man and all your beauty’s wasted.

20
00:01:39,042 --> 00:01:41,500
You must test your beauty. You must see how beautiful you are.

21
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:44,542
You’re so handsome."

22
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:48,083
He said, "Really?" "Yes. There’s a very simple way of testing you."

23
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:52,542
"It’s how?" They said, "There’s a

24
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,500
wedding coming up of a very beautiful woman.

25
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:06,250
She is the princess of the beauty city, is called Roop Nagar,

26
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:11,209
and you should go there and see how she will appreciate you.

27
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:18,209
So he, in his ego, became so stupid that he went there.

28
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:22,334
And he was sitting and lots of people were coming,

29
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:25,375
big big maharajas, rajas, all of them were sitting

30
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:30,292
and he was thinking, "Oh, I’m the
best among all of them. Who are these?

31
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:33,500
The princess will just garland me, no doubt about it."

32
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:40,000
And these two were putting that illusion in his head, branti.

33
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:43,500
With the Agnya, you get branti.

34
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:49,209
This princess came round. She
looked at him and she laughed aloud.

35
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:53,250
She couldn’t control herself and she moved on giggling.

36
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:55,542
He couldn’t understand why she laughed at him.

37
00:02:56,083 --> 00:03:00,292
She didn’t garland him or nothing but she just laughed.

38
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:04,167
So he couldn’t understand, "I’m such a handsome man," this thing.

39
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,417
So these two gandharvas told him, "Oh, it doesn’t matter.

40
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:11,292
You see, she doesn’t understand. She’ll come back," this, that.

41
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,542
Then they went out and near a lake and he sat down

42
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:19,417
to wash his face and looked at in the water his reflection.

43
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,209
He looked like a monkey.

44
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:27,375
He looked at these two and he cursed them.

45
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
He said, "I look like a monkey."

46
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,334
Said, "To us, you look like very handsome."

47
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:38,042
"But I really look like a monkey."

48
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:44,542
So this branti, this illusion was created in his mind by his ego.

49
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,167
But this power, itself, Mahakali’s power,

50
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:55,417
She puts this ego right by creating illusion, branti.

51
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:04,500
And this is responsible for many illusions we run after.

52
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:11,083
It’s a mirage, running after it, running after it.

53
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,334
Once we are satisfied within ourselves,

54
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,292
then we don’t run after mirages.

55
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:25,500
So today we are going to worship that Mahakali power.

56
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,417
May God bless you.
