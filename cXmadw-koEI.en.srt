1
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,920
First I’ll speak in English language

2
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,200
and then in Hindi.

3
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Today, long time back,

4
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,240
Christ was born.

5
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,520
You all know the story of His birth.

6
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,560
And

7
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,880
of all the sufferings He had to go through.

8
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,760
He's the One who has

9
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,640
given us a model of a Sahaja Yoga,

10
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,720
for He didn't live for Himself,

11
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,680
in no way.

12
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,040
But He lived for others,

13
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,200
working out the Agnya chakra.

14
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,640
You may be divine,

15
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,480
you may be very powerful,

16
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,320
but this world is so cruel

17
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,480
that they don't understand spirituality.

18
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,480
They don't understand the spiritual greatness.

19
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,200
Not only that,

20
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,200
but there are many factors which attack spirituality.

21
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,440
They have always done it.

22
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,800
Every saint has suffered a lot.

23
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:12,440
But I think Christ has suffered the most.

24
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:22,120
As you know, He was endowed with all the powers of Shri Ganesh,

25
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,480
as He is the reincarnation of Shri Ganesha.

26
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,320
The first of them was His innocence.

27
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,600
He was the eternal child we should say.

28
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,680
That He couldn't understand the cruelties and the hypocrisy

29
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,280
of this stupid world.

30
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Still, if you understand what can you do about it?

31
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,480
But with great courage He took birth

32
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,640
in the country where people had no idea of

33
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,920
spirituality.

34
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,800
I have read a book about Him

35
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,520
saying that He came to Kashmir

36
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,160
where He met one of My forefathers - Shalivahana.

37
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,760
It’s very interesting because it’s all in Sanskrit

38
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,439
and the writer perhaps did not know Sanskrit,

39
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,800
so he has given

40
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,920
everything in Sanskrit language,

41
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,880
which is not very congenial, I'm sure,

42
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,560
to the Western people.

43
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,920
Thank God he didn't know Sanskrit,

44
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,360
otherwise it would have been very dangerous.

45
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,200
It's written in that

46
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,760
that he asked Christ, “Why have You come to India?”

47
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,240
So He said, “This is My country,

48
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,640
that's why I've come here,

49
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,440
where people respect spirituality.

50
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,720
But I live among people

51
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,840
who do not understand spirituality at all.”

52
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,960
His conversation

53
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,840
with him was very, very interesting.

54
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,240
Because Shalivahana said

55
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,400
that “There is more reason that You should go back to Your country

56
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,560
and teach them Nirmala Tattwam.”

57
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,320
That's the principle of purification.

58
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,480
Went back, after three and a half years,

59
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,200
He was crucified.

60
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,680
I personally think the big difference

61
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,200
between the Western execution and Indian

62
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,960
is that it’s -

63
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,600
in the West,

64
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:31,439
killing is a very great profession.

65
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,960
With the slightest pretext they kill people.

66
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:42,760
Anybody who is a saint was killed

67
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,360
or they called him a madcap.

68
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,160
It's the best way to avoid spirituality.

69
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,120
While in India,

70
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,160
if a saint says anything,

71
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,920
then he is not challenged - never.

72
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,960
But they believe in it.

73
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,920
Because he is a saint, he is a much higher personality than we are.

74
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,800
Though there were very nasty people around and they tortured them.

75
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:27,080
But as a whole the public, the people, respected them.

76
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,360
If there are false gurus, normally they don't stay in this country

77
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,400
because they know they'll be found out.

78
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,360
Also they are so money-oriented that they go to America or

79
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,320
to some foreign countries and settle down there to make money.

80
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,800
This is one of the signs one should see.

81
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,760
This may be one of the reasons why

82
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,200
Christ was born in a very, very ordinary family.

83
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:12,120
He had no proper bed to sleep as a child also.

84
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,400
It's all described,

85
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,240
where He slept,

86
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,600
how His mother and father

87
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:34,360
lived in a place where

88
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,520
there were cows and calves.

89
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,120
It was to show that

90
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:52,040
spirituality doesn't need any luxury,

91
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,880
doesn't need any pomp and show.

92
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,920
It is a power within.

93
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,120
It is a glow and the light within

94
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,000
which shows,

95
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,040
automatically.

96
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,439
You don't have to do anything to show it off.

97
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:32,560
Such a person doesn't have any sense of money

98
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,040
and other things as possessions.

99
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,680
He was bothered about people who were suffering physically,

100
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,240
even the lepers,

101
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,320
and He tried to cure them,

102
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,800
He tried to help so many people who were sick physically,

103
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,600
because at that time,

104
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,439
there were no hospitals, no doctors.

105
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,240
So His attention was drawn to people

106
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:21,760
who were suffering physically.

107
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,360
Also mentally He tried to prepare them.

108
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,360
There are so many beautiful sermons on the mount.

109
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,400
In a way that time, people

110
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,320
were not so materialistic,

111
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,880
so they listened to Him -

112
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,920
you can't say how many understood Him.

113
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,040
It's very important

114
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,160
that if you are not a realized soul,

115
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,320
then it’s difficult

116
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,920
to understand spirituality.

117
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,000
The one who is talking about spirituality

118
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,920
and the one who is listening to it,

119
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,320
both of them have to have minimum of realization.

120
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,880
So from His beautiful life that I've seen,

121
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,680
we have to learn

122
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,720
that unless and until we are realized soul,

123
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,480
we will be torturing the spirit of Christ.

124
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,400
We have seen it’s happening, all those who talk of Christ.

125
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,520
He has said it very clearly,

126
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,360
“You'll be calling Me, ‘Christ, Christ,’ I won't recognize you.”

127
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,720
Very clearly He has said it.

128
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,120
I don't know why they didn't remove it from the Bible.

129
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,280
It means those who will talk

130
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,960
and preach and dress up

131
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,960
to show off that they are spiritual in the name of Christ,

132
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,640
He will not recognize them.

133
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,400
It’s as simple as that.

134
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,680
And this time now when it's the Last Judgment,

135
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:43,600
He is going to judge the whole world on the basis

136
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,200
of spirituality, which means vibrations.

137
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,840
His judgment has already started.

138
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,160
I've seen it.

139
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,160
You can see in so many countries

140
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,840
things are just disappearing.

141
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,440
All their ego,

142
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,240
all their aggressiveness,

143
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,439
all their cruelties are being challenged.

144
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:28,280
And those who did wrong in the war also

145
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,520
are taken to task.

146
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,040
So in the history also,

147
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,640
those who have done wrong to any community,

148
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,120
to any people,

149
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,120
they all will be taken to task.

150
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,680
They had no business to be aggressive on people

151
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,040
and to torture them.

152
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,840
This is what is Shri Ganesha's principle

153
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,920
acting through Sahaja Yoga.

154
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,880
Christ didn't say that,

155
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,280
but He did say,

156
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,800
“There will be Last Judgment.”

157
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,480
On one side He was very kind and compassionate,

158
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,160
on the other side He was really Shri Ganesha,

159
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,439
because

160
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,560
He took a hunter to hit the people

161
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,720
who were selling things in the temple.

162
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,120
You cannot have business in the name of religion.

163
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,480
What a big thing it is to understand.

164
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,400
But the Christians didn't follow that, they did not.

165
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,080
I don't know where have they gone.

166
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,560
As we have Mahatma Gandhi

167
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,400
who talked of spirituality and nothing else,

168
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,600
adhyatma all the time.

169
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,040
But his successors who came

170
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,080
put him somewhere with his spirituality

171
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,040
and started a new world, new ideas

172
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:38,280
and a new style of life.

173
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,400
Those who are supposed to be His followers

174
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,840
are now wanting to have many pubs,

175
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,040
and also all kinds of things, can you imagine?

176
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,560
This Congress was started by Mahatma Gandhi,

177
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,640
and the Congress wallahs are doing all this.

178
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,000
Where are they going to lead?

179
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,560
The beauty of this country is,

180
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,680
the treasure of this country is spirituality.

181
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,320
Instead of taking to spirituality, where are they going?

182
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,760
They may not be Christians, but they respect Christ,

183
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,280
they respect Bible.

184
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,720
I must tell you, is a fact, people don't know.

185
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,800
They are not Christians means in the sense they are not baptized,

186
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,480
but they respect because they understand

187
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,560
that there was so much of spirituality about Christ.

188
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,480
He was the personification of spirituality.

189
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,600
That's the beauty of Indians:

190
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,600
if somebody is a Hindu or a Muslim, makes no difference.

191
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,880
There were many Muslims who were saints and Sufis in India,

192
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,960
they are all respected by everyone whether they are Muslims or Hindus.

193
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,960
So for Christ,

194
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,920
nobody has any objection at all.

195
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,960
On the contrary, you saw yesterday how they were all happy about it

196
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,720
because they are realized souls.

197
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,960
But even if they are not,

198
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:38,600
in this country Christ is very much respected.

199
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,360
They can't understand, how can they scrutinize the life of Christ?

200
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,280
How can they judge Him?

201
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,240
And how can they make vulgar films about Him?

202
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,000
This they can't bear it,

203
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,840
because the respect that they have for spirituality

204
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,120
exists very much more than it exists outside.

205
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,560
Because in the name of Christ people have done such a lot of wrong,

206
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,320
such a lot of killing has been done.

207
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:23,720
All kinds of wrong things have been accepted.

208
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,360
With all this, one doesn't understand

209
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,200
how they have judged Christ.

210
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,600
For example, what I know in England, I saw, I was shocked

211
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,280
that if somebody dies, they drink.

212
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,200
If somebody is born, they drink.

213
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,320
Drinking is the only way they have relationships.

214
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,320
“How can you drink?”

215
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,280
I asked them. They said, “Why? Christ created wine.”

216
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,600
I said, "When?" "In a wedding."

217
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,320
I said, "In a wedding? That was not wine,

218
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,960
that was just the juice of the

219
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,760
grapes that they grew there."

220
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:22,480
We call it drakshas in our language.

221
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,600
How can that be wine?

222
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,760
It has to be first fermented,

223
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,439
it has to be rotten, how can that be?

224
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,200
So this is biggest dharma - to drink.

225
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,200
But in India we know,

226
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,640
though nobody has said anything against drinking,

227
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,280
but we know drinking is a sinful thing.

228
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,720
You see it everyday,

229
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,680
everybody knows that if you drink

230
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,400
you become absolutely out of your mind.

231
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,560
There's nothing to be said

232
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,960
on a religious platform, but everybody knows

233
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,960
that what is drinking is.

234
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,360
Not that people abroad don't know, they also know.

235
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,160
But somehow it has become a fashion.

236
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,360
Even in our country it has now been introduced,

237
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:38,760
I don't know how after Independence, people have started drinking.

238
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,320
Every party they drink,

239
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,880
also in the name of Christ on Christmas day.

240
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:56,200
It's such a insult to His beautiful holy life.

241
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:04,440
So, when They came on this earth, perhaps all Their

242
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,880
powers of holiness were destroyed.

243
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,880
The very good thing about Indians is that at least they respect,

244
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,720
they respect a holy place.

245
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,720
That is something good about them.

246
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,000
And they know what is holiness is.

247
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,840
Now of course they are becoming very modern and Americanized.

248
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,760
But still, they know what is wrong,

249
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,040
what should not be done.

250
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,680
With Sahaja Yoga now I am very happy to say

251
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,280
that the foreign Sahaja Yogis also have become very beautiful.

252
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,440
I'm surprised,

253
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,400
because in their culture there is no spirituality.

254
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,439
But I don't know how they left all that nonsense

255
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,360
and have come out like lotuses, beautifully,

256
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:18,360
with such beautiful fragrance of spirituality.

257
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,200
This is something - a miracle.

258
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,640
Everybody says, “Mother, we can't believe it,

259
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,400
how could have happened ? How did You manage this?”

260
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,320
I would say it's the blessing of Christ.

261
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,680
They saw how people are

262
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,520
working out in the name of Christ in a very degraded manner,

263
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:56,960
and they developed a kind of a awareness

264
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,040
that definitely something wrong with this,

265
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,360
this is not Christ.

266
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:08,600
This is not His holy life they are depicting.

267
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,800
It’s something else.

268
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,920
And that is how I think in the West

269
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,240
there's a greater urge,

270
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,320
greater ascending force.

271
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,520
Yesterday somebody came and told Me,

272
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,520
“Mother, there is no collective meditation.”

273
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,200
I was very happy to hear that.

274
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,880
What is most important is meditation in Sahaja Yoga,

275
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,600
no doubt about it.

276
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,400
But

277
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:49,360
the foreigners do meditation much more than Indians do,very surprising.

278
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:55,439
And foreign men and women are very highly equipped

279
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,280
I must say, as far as spirituality is concerned.

280
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,320
Especially Russians,

281
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,760
I was surprised that in America,

282
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,720
they told Me, “Mother, these Americans are not Sahaja Yogis.”

283
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,840
I said, “Why?” “They don't have that respect for You,

284
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,040
they don't meditate.

285
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,560
Those who do not meditate are not Sahaja Yogis.”

286
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,280
I said. "I agree."

287
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:33,320
And they make all of them, all the Americans to meditate.

288
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,800
I don't know why in these Eastern Bloc people,

289
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:46,280
Bulgarians and Russians and all these Romanians,

290
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,560
how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga so much.

291
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,880
Of course, they had the curse of communism on them.

292
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:03,040
Maybe that they felt that they have missed something in life,

293
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:06,680
and they went deep down into themselves,

294
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,439
and that is how they have achieved it.

295
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,280
But I have to tell Indians

296
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,120
that they have to meditate.

297
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,920
Indians have one or two very bad qualities,

298
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,200
and that is one of them is groupism.

299
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,400
For example, if they're Brahmins, they'll sit together;

300
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,400
if they are Kayasthas, they'll sit together;

301
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,880
if they are Bhaniyas, they'll sit together.

302
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,920
If that is not so, then by another name they'll group together.

303
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,600
This is the worst curse of My country,

304
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,640
because once you start grouping together

305
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,400
you can never see the good of others

306
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,200
and you can never see the bad of yourself.

307
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,120
This grouping together can bring lot of problems in this country.

308
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,000
At the time of Christ

309
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:16,040
they had very different type of people.

310
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,240
Either they were interested in spirituality,

311
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,640
or they were not.

312
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:29,160
Now we have people here who are interested in spirituality,

313
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,880
but still they - one leg is in the water.

314
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,080
Where the age old problems still exist.

315
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,439
And this is the ruin of our country.

316
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,640
We cannot combine together,

317
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,320
we cannot be friends with each other.

318
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,840
Of course not in Sahaja Yoga, I must say,

319
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,520
it has been solved very well.

320
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,400
But if you see even at the time of Christ,

321
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,600
He had problems with His disciples.

322
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,640
Especially something happened with Peter.

323
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,480
And

324
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,080
He is the one who says a Satan will meet you.

325
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,520
Because I think people

326
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,960
fall into the group of satanic forces.

327
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,600
And He said that He removed the satanic

328
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,840
devils

329
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,560
from many people and put them in the pigs.

330
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,200
It's true.

331
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,280
There is a satanic force

332
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,960
which is working very strongly.

333
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,880
The more we develop security of spirituality,

334
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,160
the more they will develop.

335
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,480
The satanic force is in a different form in the West

336
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,960
and a different form in the East.

337
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,400
But I would like to tell for them

338
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,320
to be careful

339
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,439
how to find out the satanic forces in the West.

340
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,480
You may not be affected by that

341
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,120
because you are realized souls,

342
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,640
but you’ll have to fight it.

343
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,480
You will have to fight it,

344
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,000
for example racialism.

345
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,640
Racialism is still very powerful there, very, very powerful.

346
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,520
And you have to fight racialism

347
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,240
through marrying people who belong to other races.

348
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,720
But still I find difficult

349
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,360
to marry a black person to a white person -

350
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,080
is an impossible situation.

351
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,120
If I try that I don't know what happens.

352
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:34,600
Once we had such a marriage, I must tell you.

353
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:42,520
And a white lady, French lady, was married to a black man.

354
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,200
Instead of the French lady dominating, this black man dominated.

355
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,439
So I was quite surprised, you know, how could that be?

356
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,840
So, the reason was,

357
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,320
I think he was taking the revenge maybe, the respite.

358
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,880
So first of all,

359
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:10,000
tremendous love and affection has to grow

360
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,240
between

361
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:16,400
the people.

362
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,240
This color is so skin deep.

363
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,880
It has nothing to do with the love inside, nothing.

364
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,280
It's so skin deep.

365
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,680
Thank God in our country,

366
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,240
you can have a wife

367
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,240
who will be very dark, husband will be very fair

368
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,240
or the vice-versa.

369
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,520
But they never look at that from that angle.

370
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,360
I don't think that exists in this country.

371
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,840
But we have another kind, you see,

372
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,640
just is a typical human problem

373
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:08,920
is that he discriminates. Through ego,

374
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,960
which I must say,

375
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:18,320
Christ has tried to fight your ego.

376
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,760
He was born in a very humble family

377
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,640
and

378
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,160
He was not a white-skinned man, no.

379
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,080
In your language He was brown,

380
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,320
but in Indian language He was black.

381
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,760
But, when it comes to spirituality,

382
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,240
you just see

383
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,440
the enlightened one.

384
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:00,360
You don't see what color they have of the skin.

385
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,360
It's very, very superficial.

386
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,400
But this is one of the enemies of the Western life,

387
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,200
I think, which must be conquered

388
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,400
Materialism is another one.

389
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,320
But the worst of all which is against Christ

390
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,040
is immorality.

391
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,840
Immorality is so much accepted in the West.

392
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,160
All kinds of immoral behavior is accepted.

393
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,439
Like, they say that

394
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,439
all these immoral people say, vote for somebody,

395
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,920
he becomes a president of America.

396
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:58,480
Then it’s all right, doesn't matter, all kinds of immorality is allowed.

397
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,320
But that is absolutely against Christ,

398
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,800
absolutely.

399
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,800
People don't understand

400
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,480
that immorality will lead them

401
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,680
to a kingdom which I don't know what to call because

402
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,680
it's even worse than animal kingdom.

403
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,920
And they are so immoral,

404
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,000
they listen to people like Freud,

405
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,000
as if they have no brains,

406
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,680
they have no spirit,

407
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,440
to take note of such a man.

408
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,320
Only after Sahaja Yoga,

409
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,880
model of Christ's life you can have.

410
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,400
Whatever is past is over and finished.

411
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,040
Today now you are realized souls

412
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,920
and morality is your strength.

413
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,240
Forget about the past,

414
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,760
and I'm sure

415
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,240
you can get many more people

416
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,840
under the banner of Sahaja Yoga

417
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,360
if you lead a very, very moral life.

418
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,680
At the same time,

419
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,120
another very bad

420
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,720
enemy we have is our anger.

421
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,080
So they are very proud, they will say,

422
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,560
"I'll now get angry.

423
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
You know, I'm very angry."

424
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,040
They are not ashamed about it

425
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,400
and they go on saying that "I'm very angry,"

426
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,440
as if it's not wrong to say, "I'm very angry."

427
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,240
Now they say, “I hate you.”

428
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:19,320
I mean, imagine any Indian language, if they use this word

429
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,000
it would be meaning “I'm committing sin.”

430
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,200
So all this aggressiveness comes from anger.

431
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,480
If somebody has to be angry,

432
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,720
he should be angry with himself.

433
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,120
Best is, to get rid of anger,

434
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,920
you can pull your hair, you can bite yourself,

435
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:55,240
you can use your pillow to hit yourself.

436
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:03,080
That may be the best way of taking out your anger.

437
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,560
But see for what are you angry?

438
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,120
Sometimes it’s absolutely useless.

439
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:13,480
Sometimes it has no meaning.

440
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,960
Sometimes

441
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:21,280
it's absolutely maddening, stupid.

442
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:29,640
But as long as you stop saying, "I'm very angry,"

443
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,080
that's it.

444
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,600
That's the time you should know you are falling down completely.

445
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,520
So Christ didn't talk of all the subtle things,

446
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,360
I have been talking to you, because that was left to Me.

447
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,040
Without realization, how can you talk about subtler things?

448
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,760
You cannot.

449
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,600
Last time I told you about the vibrations,

450
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,760
what is it, what does it stand for

451
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:13,360
and how you get the subtle energy which we call as tanmatra,

452
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,800
of our light - tejas,

453
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,520
of water - jala,

454
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,000
and prithvi, agni.

455
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:33,480
But, I didn't tell you of one very special one

456
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,560
which is, in English language you call  it ether.

457
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,160
But ether is the energy

458
00:43:43,439 --> 00:43:49,960
which is managed by another tanmatra, we call it akash.

459
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,160
It's specially today, because it's Christ

460
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,000
who has sacrificed His life to open our Agnya Chakra,

461
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,000
that we have reached that state of akash.

462
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,320
Without Him it would not have been possible.

463
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,600
We can have general communication.

464
00:44:18,439 --> 00:44:22,480
Like we can talk to people, we can say things,

465
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,920
we can also use our fingers to express ourselves,

466
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,920
our hands to communicate.

467
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,280
But,

468
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,640
to communicate vibrations,

469
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,880
you have to have vibrations.

470
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,280
Otherwise you cannot feel another person.

471
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,120
But if you are at the Agnya level, means you are mental,

472
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,800
absolutely mental,

473
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,640
then your vibrations also are dwindling, in the sense

474
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,120
you don't know what really they are saying.

475
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:11,400
You can't judge your vibrations, because these vibrations are mental.

476
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:18,040
They'll say, “Mother, we asked the vibrations.” I said, "Really?"

477
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,960
If you don't have any vibrations, how can you ask the vibrations?

478
00:45:23,439 --> 00:45:24,960
It's very common thing.

479
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,800
“We ask the vibration; we found from the vibrations.”

480
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,680
It's not possible because you are just mental.

481
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:43,800
Now what Christ has done is to put you away from the mental level.

482
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:48,480
That is the most difficult. While I’m surprised,

483
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,480
those who follow Christianity have the worst mental position.

484
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,840
They are mentally absolutely there,  like,

485
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,600
I don't know what to call, like the fog of Delhi

486
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,000
that you can't cross.

487
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,520
That’s what was broken was Christ.

488
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,800
How much we should be obliged to Him,

489
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:22,240
that He removed the greatest hurdle in the human ascent,

490
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,439
and that one was

491
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,000
to break this Agnya,

492
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:34,680
this mental being within us.

493
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,040
We read like mad,

494
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,760
we listen to people like mad,

495
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:50,160
we like those who give us feed for our mental being.

496
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,560
They're so mental, so argumentative,

497
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,400
think no end of their intelligence,

498
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,720
that you have to just say, “All right, namaskar.”

499
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,880
You can't fight their mental attitude.

500
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,200
That's why Christ

501
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,520
is to be worshipped

502
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,560
by people who are so very mental.

503
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,120
And this mental nonsense has given

504
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,600
such a sense of superiority to people.

505
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,000
“Oh, whatever we do, what's wrong? What's wrong?”

506
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,040
They cannot correct themselves

507
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:46,960
because unless and until you cross this limit of mental being,

508
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:52,200
you cannot see yourself.

509
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,760
You cannot introspect . You cannot see yourself.

510
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,160
You'll see others, “These Sahaja Yogis are like this,

511
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,600
Sahaja Yoga is like that,” all kinds of things.

512
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,320
But you can't see yourself,

513
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,400
because the whole thing is mental.

514
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:20,400
This mental attitude should be completely curbed

515
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,280
through the help of our Lord Jesus Christ.

516
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,400
But He's also mental,

517
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,280
in your brains Christ is also mental, now what to do?

518
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,280
The One who broke the mental attitude is also a mental -

519
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:45,720
you have made Him into mental, like a statue

520
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,160
of stone.

521
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,400
So, firstly we have to tell ourselves,

522
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,040
“Now don't think, don't think, don't think, don't think.”

523
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,760
Four times,

524
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,840
and then you can rise above.

525
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,320
And this is very important.

526
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:17,360
In meditation you have to go beyond the mind.

527
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:23,000
And thanks to Christ that He’s sitting at the Agnya

528
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:28,720
to finish off this nonsense of mental being.

529
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,760
I think people should stop reading also perhaps, maybe.

530
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,400
Even My lecture becomes mental, what to do?

531
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,000
I mean everything goes into their head becomes mental, somehow.

532
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,880
And then they ask Me questions, “Mother, did You say it this way,

533
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:54,560
what did You -” I said, “I said it to make you thoughtless.

534
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,080
Just to stun you,

535
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:04,000
I didn’t say this to sit down and analyze and do, no, no.

536
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:11,439
I said this that you become absolutely shocked and stunned.”

537
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,760
So the best thing for all of you is

538
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,920
to become thoughtless.

539
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,400
That’s the blessing of Christ,

540
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,240
that’s what He worked it out for you.

541
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,320
And I am sure,

542
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:40,080
if you work it out that don’t pay attention to others.

543
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,240
Don’t react,

544
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,520
just don’t react.

545
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,040
Everything they will see, they’ll react.

546
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,320
What is the need?

547
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,600
What is the use?

548
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,520
What are you going to do with that reaction?

549
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,760
This reaction creates nothing but ripples of thoughts

550
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,320
in your mind, I’ve told you hundreds of times.

551
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:18,520
And now you have to become

552
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,400
absolutely thoughtless

553
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,720
after this puja.

554
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:31,200
If that happens, I think we have achieved a lot.

555
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,200
That’s the biggest blessing that Christ has given you,

556
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,400
which you should really enjoy.

557
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:47,400
Then only this Akash Tattwa in you will work.

558
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,040
And how it works?

559
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,960
Through your attention,

560
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,439
it works with Me as you know.

561
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,480
With My attention I work out many things.

562
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,440
How?

563
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,960
Just My attention has become thoughtless,

564
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,280
just thoughtless.

565
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,680
It goes wherever it goes, it works.

566
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,840
But if you put your attention for thought all the time

567
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,800
for thinking,

568
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:30,240
then it doesn’t do the work that it has supposed to do.

569
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,480
Attention works marvelously

570
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,080
if you are thoughtless, otherwise it doesn’t.

571
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:49,680
So it has to rise from your own self.

572
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,240
Then from others

573
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,240
to the higher level of humanity,

574
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,320
where you are in communication with the sky,

575
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,360
with, we can call it as the

576
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:11,480
tanmatra, or the essential, or the essence

577
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,680
of ether.

578
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,960
With ether you can have television, you can have telephone.

579
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,280
It's a miracle otherwise.

580
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,520
But with this tanmatra,

581
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,040
sitting down here

582
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,439
you can do the job.

583
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,040
It works,

584
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,520
just attention works. I know that.

585
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,600
You also know very well.

586
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,280
You don't have to ask Me to put the attention,

587
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,000
you just put the attention and it will work out.

588
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:52,320
It’s a very important thing that you have got.

589
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,400
I think that is the first thing -

590
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,040
once you have,

591
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,840
no problem.

592
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:09,080
But we start manifesting from the earth element.

593
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,040
Then from the agni element, then from the jala element,

594
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,840
and then we come to tejas,

595
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,240
where the face starts shining.

596
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,480
But lastly we get this thoughtless awareness

597
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:35,160
by which our attention is absolutely free to do

598
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,640
some special work.

599
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,080
But if you are all the time thinking,

600
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,520
then poor this attention

601
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,760
is so busy, you know, so very busy.

602
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,160
You don't have to ask Me then,

603
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,439
"Mother, please pay attention." You can pay attention,

604
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,280
and you can work it out.

605
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:09,640
In this attention, you don't feel

606
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,040
what you've got, what you are standing,

607
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:19,760
what you are wearing, what others are doing - no, nothing.

608
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,040
You are one with yourself.

609
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And it's a life full of humor.

610
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,880
So much humor.

611
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,440
So much of joy.

612
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,560
So much of happiness

613
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,840
that you don't care for anything

614
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,160
that normally people care for.

615
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,440
So,

616
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:59,120
as it is now Sahaja Yoga has worked in so many countries.

617
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,920
I'm so very proud of you, very proud.

618
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,960
And now it is also going to African countries,

619
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:11,440
is a very great satisfaction for Me.

620
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,040
And you all can do it;

621
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,960
you all can work it out.

622
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:25,080
Only thing, become thoughtlessly aware,

623
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,520
as the blessing of Christ.

624
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,920
If it works,

625
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:36,640
you will be absolutely enjoying yourself.

626
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,640
So may God bless you.
