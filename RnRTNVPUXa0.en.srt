1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Everything in Sahaja Yoga is very scientific,

2
00:00:06,626 --> 00:00:10,626
is all pre-planned I think, and is all significant.

3
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:16,584
For example, today is Wednesday

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and we have never had any Puja on a Wednesday

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,542
because I was born on Wednesday.

6
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:28,375
So I was thinking if the Puja starts before twelve o’clock

7
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:30,459
we’ll be able to manage it

8
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:32,501
because I was born at twelve.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So every child has to sleep after twelve o’clock, you see,

10
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:41,417
and so I couldn’t, I had to sleep. So it’s so significant, you see.

11
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:44,000
It’s the first time we are having a Puja on Wednesday,

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,209
normally I don’t even travel on Wednesdays.

13
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:53,167
So, you can imagine that it’s such a breakthrough and I’m very happy

14
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:55,417
that you all are ready for a Puja

15
00:00:55,459 --> 00:01:01,125
and that we could break this rule also,

16
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:04,501
after such a long time,

17
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:11,000
because it was impossible for me to keep awake after twelve, you see

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,584
I was trying, trying, trying

19
00:01:12,626 --> 00:01:16,042
and I knew that you all, also, were feeling very sleepy.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So it’s so mutual and it’s so simple.Alright.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,417
So today we have gathered, really, remarkably,

22
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:40,334
in the really centre of the Nabhi of the universe,

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and I don’t know how far

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I can go with the description of this great country

25
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,375
which we call as Greece.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,542
Also, in the Puranas it is described as Manipura Dweep.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,375
The Manipur is the Nabhi Chakra – Manipur,

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,459
and a “dweep” is a island.

29
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:15,417
Island of the Manipura stays the Athena,

30
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:20,459
and there is a temple of Athena,

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,334
all been described about Her temple, about Her

32
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,250
jewelry, dress and everything.

33
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:38,083
So it’s already in the Puranas described, this Athena.

34
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,250
As I’ve told you before, ‘Athena’ means the Primordial Mother.

35
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:46,459
So now, one may say that,

36
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,709
“Why the Primordial Mother, Adi Shakti,

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
should be on the Nabhi Chakra of the universe?”

38
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:55,000
One may ask a question like that,

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
that, “Why She’s placed on the Nabhi Chakra?”

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Because in the – I don’t know in English –

41
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:16,417
before the Creation was created in the material form,

42
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,375
where it was planned,

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,584
then there was something of the –

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
what we call is the Vishnuloka,

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,501
is the loka, or the area where Vishnu ruled,

46
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:45,417
and in that Vishnuloka it was decided

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,083
that Adi Shakti should first come in the form as a cow,

48
00:03:55,667 --> 00:04:01,334
and then She should descend in the area called as Gokul,

49
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,375
which is Vishuddhi Chakra,  first

50
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,667
and create vibrations there.

51
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:11,667
Now in the material form the Gokul was

52
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:15,292
where Shri Krishna lived in His childhood.

53
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:24,209
So in the material form, Athena itself lived –

54
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:31,042
in the material form, I’m not saying in the formation before –

55
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:35,709
in this area, to create the vibrations.

56
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,626
So it is not only She was a Goddess

57
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,584
but She lived in this area

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
to create the vibrations for the Nabhi,

59
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:52,584
to create the universal

60
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:58,542
compassion and love and all Her qualities.

61
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:05,584
Now as you know, every aspect of the Goddess has different qualities

62
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:14,459
and as you can see that Mahakali has the aspect of comforting,

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and Mahasaraswati is counselling,

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,626
and the Mahalakshmi has got

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
for the redemption, for the awakening.

66
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:33,250
But the Adi Shakti’s work

67
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,250
is to unite everything, to integrate everything;

68
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:41,709
and to integrate all those qualities,

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
the Adi Shakti Herself was…

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,626
in material form, came on this earth, in this part,

71
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:55,209
and that’s why they knew about Athena.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But as it is,

73
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,250
I don’t know what are the stories they have–

74
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,250
they must be having some mythological stories about Athena

75
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:07,292
that She lived like this or whatever it was.

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,334
And this is the…

77
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,584
where She created the Devaloka.

78
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:18,000
Devaloka is the area where devas existed.

79
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:21,000
Like She created Indra –

80
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,375
you have heard the name of Indra – then Varuna;

81
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:29,375
all these devalokas She created in this area, not in India.

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Devaloka was created on this side,

83
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:38,209
and ganas and all these people were created

84
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:42,667
on the side of Nepal and all those places, on the left-hand side.

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Now unfortunately after Socrates, who came here

86
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:59,417
in such a condition when people were really,

87
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,250
absolutely ignorant, in the complete darkness of ignorance,

88
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,250
they could not understand Him,

89
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,292
they could not understand Socrates at all

90
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:13,459
and so like any other Primordial Master was treated

91
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:17,459
by the people who were surrounding Him,

92
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,250
He was also very much ill-treated and nobody listened to Him.

93
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,501
But of course, as you know, He was Primordial Master

94
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:30,000
and His wisdom is well-known and He created out of Him

95
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:35,584
disciples, but none of them could go anywhere near His wisdom,

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and they started their own theories, own styles,

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and that’s how we find the accent from

98
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
philosophy that was Socrates’ aim,

99
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:51,334
gradually came into political and then into economic side.

100
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:55,334
So the attention was moved from philosophy

101
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,375
to economics today,

102
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:03,626
not towards the philosophy which was established by Socrates.

103
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:08,375
We can say Socrates was the one Primordial Master,

104
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:16,250
after Abraham and Moses, who really made it

105
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:22,292
very clear-cut understanding about spirituality.

106
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:28,334
Of course Moses and Mohammad…

107
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,000
Abraham had different problems.

108
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,083
Like Abraham had problems of talking to people

109
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,584
who were  really very, very ignorant,

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,417
and Moses had problem with people who were very indulgent people,

111
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,209
so He had to pass laws of Shariat.

112
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,000
Moses passed the law of Shariat,

113
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,709
and if you read Bible, in the –

114
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,417
I think – in the first verse only it is written about Shariat

115
00:08:56,626 --> 00:09:04,417
in the Jeremiah (Leviticus?), third book of Bible,

116
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:09,167
that Moses had to pass these laws, different, different laws

117
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:13,292
to make the people follow religion precisely.

118
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,626
So He did not argue, He did not say

119
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:21,375
why you should do it, didn’t give any explanation. “You do it!” Like that.

120
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:24,501
Because He thought that these people are so ignorant

121
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:28,125
that you cannot leave it to their freedom

122
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:34,667
that you understand this or

123
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,626
that you see the point;

124
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,417
He could not do that way.

125
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,626
So He just said, “Alright. These are the laws, these are the things

126
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,209
and you have to follow. If you don’t follow then you will be killed,

127
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:50,209
your hands will be cut, this will happen, that will happen.”

128
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:54,417
Because the people were of that type.

129
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,083
Now then you see how gradually,

130
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:02,083
at the time of Socrates people had evolved,

131
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:04,167
they were a much better people

132
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:08,292
so He could talk to them about something

133
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,250
of wisdom, of honesty, of righteousness, of peace.

134
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,250
Of so many things He talked,

135
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,417
and He could talk because people were worthy of that.

136
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Otherwise He could have said, “Alright.

137
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You do this, you do that, you do that.”

138
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:32,626
But see the difference also in the circumstances how what has happened:

139
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:37,584
in the first circumstances when Abraham had problems

140
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,375
then the people were absolutely good-for-nothing,

141
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,542
absolutely good for nothing, so He didn’t know what to do with them.

142
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:51,667
So only, you can see it, in the time of Abraham that His own lifestyle…

143
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:56,125
I mean, that was just a system when the family was building up

144
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:58,626
and the relationships were building up,

145
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,167
and He tried to work it on that level.

146
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:07,292
Then at the time of Moses people evolved much more.

147
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:12,000
They evolved but still very ignorant.

148
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,459
So they evolved to this point

149
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:18,375
that He did not have to talk the things that Abraham talked.

150
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:23,584
So He talked to them about getting out of Egypt,

151
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,334
taking their freedom, getting out from there

152
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:35,000
and going to a place of more tranquillity.

153
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:38,542
But when they did that,

154
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:41,584
He found these people on the way –

155
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:45,334
when He went to get the Ten Commandments,

156
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,375
when He came back – what He finds…

157
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:16,626
So the people who were at the time of Moses,

158
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:22,334
when He had gone to get the Ten Commandments,

159
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,417
started indulging into very, very immoral character,

160
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:30,417
extremely immoral character.

161
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:36,000
They were very immoral and were doing such horrible things that

162
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,334
that nobody can believe that anybody

163
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:42,167
who tried to escape from the Egyptians

164
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:44,375
were worse than the Egyptians themselves.

165
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:50,626
So He gave this Shariat to them, to change.

166
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:59,209
Now then came the time when people were…

167
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:06,000
I mean, despite all that people were not so good,

168
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,125
we can say at the time of Christ,

169
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,459
but they were not so immoral;

170
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,626
they also could not understand Christ.

171
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:20,417
So you see, despite all the human evolution,

172
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:23,000
the human awareness evolving,

173
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:29,209
the understanding about spirituality was very poor

174
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:32,667
and you could not talk to them.

175
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,417
Now you can also see the circumstances of things.

176
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,626
When the circumstances are such,

177
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:46,000
like at the time of, say Moses,

178
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:49,542
that people are extremely immoral,

179
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:52,542
they are doing all kinds of bad things,

180
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,459
they are not bothered about their own destruction,

181
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:05,125
the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

182
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
because they were so left-sided:

183
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,209
So the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

184
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:17,000
and say that, “If you do like this,

185
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
this We’ll have to do” the violence part.

186
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,375
So they took to violence.

187
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So the circumstances made the reactions of the people,

188
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:35,042
also the awareness of human beings.

189
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:38,167
So many things worked it out.

190
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:43,125
Say, for example, when Athena came on this earth,

191
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:52,167
her job was to create a integrated force

192
00:14:55,501 --> 00:15:03,250
which will have the whole chaitanya spread like an integrated force.

193
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:11,584
So that when it will be all disintegrated later on it can integrate.

194
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:20,042
So the Greeks have a job, special job, is to integrate.

195
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:27,292
You have to integrate people

196
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,125
which are left-sided and right-sided.

197
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:38,000
And that’s what I asked him, “What happened to Hitler?”

198
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:41,000
So they said that when they saw Hitler,

199
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,125
though Hitler respected them, they resisted Hitler.

200
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You can see the significance, how he respected the Greeks

201
00:15:54,042 --> 00:16:00,292
and despite that they resisted him

202
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,292
because they were given this special capacity.

203
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:07,501
Something with Greeks, they went to…

204
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:10,501
I mean, except Alexander, only the one

205
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:16,334
who tried to invade India,

206
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:20,209
and because of the Greek nature he receded back.

207
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,667
You see it’s a Greek nature

208
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,375
that they can go so far and then not,

209
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,375
because they have an integrating force.

210
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:35,626
The same thing as I was asking him about what happened with the Turks.

211
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:41,167
They had gone into Turkey but they receded back.

212
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,459
So this power of receding back

213
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:50,000
is the integrating power,

214
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,125
by you integrate within yourself

215
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:58,125
both the qualities of the left and right and you balance it,

216
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,501
and you see now that’s alright.

217
00:17:01,501 --> 00:17:03,501
If you have to be in the centre

218
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:06,542
we should go up to a point and come back.

219
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:12,417
And this is a very basic quality of Greeks in every respect.

220
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If you take their shipping,

221
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,501
they were very aggressive in shipping to begin with,

222
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:20,709
extremely aggressive people,

223
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,709
and Greek ships were known for not maintaining at all.

224
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
They were not very law-abiding

225
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,584
so they were never used to maintain their ships, you see,

226
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:34,459
and always under trouble – the Greeks –

227
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:40,125
that in the shipping they were known to be, the Greeks have

228
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:45,167
ships which are all falling off and rattling.

229
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:50,501
So perhaps, perhaps,

230
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,501
they were aware that now the shipping is going to go down,

231
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:57,709
so no use maintaining these ships, you see.

232
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:02,083
Then when the shipping went down –

233
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,584
you see this is on economic level I’m saying, how they worked it out

234
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
they sunk their ships

235
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:13,501
and got the money out of insurance.

236
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That is a typical Greek style of behaviour

237
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:29,250
is that they know already. It’s a kind of a wisdom,

238
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,042
they know that how far to go.

239
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:35,667
Like, we can see now, Onassis also married this mad woman,

240
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:39,125
Kennedy’s wife, because  he must have realised

241
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:43,167
that Kennedy never gave her any security so he married her.

242
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:46,626
Alright. He married her up to a point,

243
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,083
but most of his property went to his daughter,

244
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,083
not to Mrs. Kennedy.

245
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:59,584
This balance and this wisdom is a special Greek style of life;

246
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:03,292
that’s why you might say that they are not over-developed

247
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:05,209
like Americans are.

248
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,417
But now Americans have realised that they are idiots,

249
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:10,542
but Greeks can never become idiots,

250
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,584
whatever you may try.

251
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,626
They are very sharp and very intelligent

252
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:20,501
but they know how far to go with everything.

253
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:24,542
And what is the reason for this? The Athena.

254
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:29,459
So Athena is the one, Adi Shakti,

255
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,459
and She created Ganesha here.

256
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:36,584
And the balance of the universe,

257
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:40,417
or all the dharmas, is in the Nabhi Chakra,

258
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:45,042
and so the people over here are very balanced.

259
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:51,209
You can find them very…

260
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:56,209
in their language, in their styles, very deep.

261
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:59,501
One may say because they are traditional people,

262
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:01,542
they have long traditions.

263
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But Egypt had also long traditions.

264
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:08,501
Of course Egyptians are, in a way,

265
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:12,417
wiser than all other Islamic countries,

266
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:17,667
but not like Greeks, not like Greeks.

267
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,250
We have Chinese also who are very wise,

268
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and they are known to be people of deep understanding,

269
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,334
but they are not like Indians.

270
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:38,292
So what is lacking in all these people is

271
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:43,292
the depth of awareness

272
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:50,375
because, though in China also Mother of Mercy came

273
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:57,626
and She really bestowed blessings upon them,

274
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:04,375
and China rose also, afterwards,

275
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:07,501
into her own glory

276
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:13,542
and became quite a good industrial,

277
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,417
I mean developed country, we can say, very powerful;

278
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:24,292
but still, that kind of regimentation could not be borne

279
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:27,042
because, after all, Mother Mercy was there.

280
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,334
Do you know last…

281
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:32,292
you have one Mother Mercy you have given me –

282
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:36,250
Kuan Yin, same thing, Kuan Yin.

283
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:39,083
And She’s the same thing called as Mother of Mercy –

284
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:46,083
and the second one was given by Gregoire recently,

285
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,542
and you see what’s happening in China.

286
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:54,417
So the effects of these

287
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,584
Deities which existed in different countries at different times

288
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:08,292
are felt only in Kali Yuga in the best way.

289
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:11,167
Now you may say that,

290
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:15,209
“Why should Mother come last to Greece?”

291
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:22,042
Because now Athena is in the Sahastrara,

292
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:25,459
so you have to go not in the Nabhi.

293
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:29,209
So I had to bring Sahastrara here, isn’t it?

294
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,375
Sahastrara is the last chakra one has to achieve,

295
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:37,334
so I thought that let Greeks

296
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:42,167
grow up to the Sahastrara point.

297
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,626
So we have to establish Sahastrara in Greece

298
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,042
and thus it’s a very powerful work we have to do in Greece

299
00:22:54,417 --> 00:23:00,209
because actually, at the time

300
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,417
when Athena came here,

301
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:06,584
it was not Sahastrara, it was Nabhi,

302
00:23:07,334 --> 00:23:12,584
because She was actually on the Himalayas, came from Himalayas.

303
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:15,626
So now to bring Himalaya here,

304
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:21,000
or to bring that purity in Greece, is a tremendous task

305
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:24,626
and we have very few sahaja yogis.

306
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:28,584
But you see the reaction of the gentleman who came?

307
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:36,000
And we have formidable job because of these Orthodox…

308
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,209
most unorthodox,

309
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,667
they have no orthodoxy about anything.

310
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:50,000
So we have a problem, big problem,

311
00:23:50,584 --> 00:23:53,584
how we’ll establish here.

312
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,250
The Devaloka was formed here

313
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:04,417
and devas were here; they ruled here, no doubt;

314
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,417
but in the human awareness they're brought down to the human level.

315
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:15,417
Like Zeus was Parashurama, Parashurama –

316
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:22,501
the one who was an Incarnation to announce the advent of Shri Rama,

317
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,167
and He came before Shri Ram, died also very much before Shri Ram;

318
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:37,334
but they painted Zeus as a man who was a womaniser.

319
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,250
So all Gods were brought to the level of human beings,

320
00:24:43,501 --> 00:24:46,501
bestowed with all the weaknesses, you see,

321
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:50,542
actually decorated with all the weaknesses.

322
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:55,083
And that is responsible for the downfall

323
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:59,167
because this part of the country

324
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:06,334
is on the pattern of Devaloka,

325
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:14,501
reflection of that, but this Devaloka is now,

326
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:21,209
we see it has become just the opposite

327
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:29,375
because Deities have been brought down to such a low level,

328
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:32,375
to such degrading things.

329
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:39,459
Even in the mythology also, in India

330
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:45,542
talks about Them like this. Not to such an extent;

331
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:52,209
like Zeus, they don’t talk but about Indra they talk.

332
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:01,125
And like Indra’s description comes like this:

333
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:09,375
that the king Hiranyakashipu’s wife was living…

334
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:15,042
his wife… Hiranyakashipu’s wife was a saintly lady

335
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:20,334
and Hiranyakashipu was ruling in the area of

336
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:25,501
you can say Kandahar and Afghanistan and all these places,

337
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,459
and from here Indra went down

338
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:34,501
and took away the wife.

339
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:39,501
I mean They incarnated, the Gods incarnated here,

340
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:43,459
and Indra went down,

341
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:47,501
He took away the wife of Hiranyakashipu with Him, to save Her,

342
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:51,501
and He went down and stayed in an ashram in Maharashtra

343
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,417
where there’s a river flowing with My name – Nira.

344
00:26:57,584 --> 00:27:01,125
So now the… see how the combinations are,

345
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:08,501
the Shandilya Muni who was the guru of My family –

346
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,501
that’s why My gotra is Shandilya –

347
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:16,042
it was in his ashram He stayed.

348
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:20,709
So the Muni Shandilya told

349
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:25,000
that, “See, this lady is a very pure lady,

350
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,501
don’t disturb her, and out of her will come a very great saint

351
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:38,042
who will, by his own devotion,

352
00:27:38,501 --> 00:27:42,501
make the Incarnation of Narasimha –

353
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:49,626
this is the god Vishnu which comes as the half-cat –

354
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,584
and He will kill this asura.

355
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:59,083
Now, part of the Egypt was also ruled by this Hiranyakashipu,

356
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:03,083
part of the Egypt – see how significant everything is.

357
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:06,626
So this Narasimha came

358
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:12,501
when…  you know about Prahlada’s story, alright, so this

359
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,375
little boy played there around and he made some

360
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:21,459
things and there’s a temple very near – you have seen Narasimha’s temple

361
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:26,584
and that you have seen the statue made out of sand?

362
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,042
That was made by Prahlad,

363
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:32,542
and he came into the dreams of someone and said that,

364
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:36,042
“In your temple you please put the statue I have made”,

365
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,000
and they went around the Nira river and found it and put it there.

366
00:28:40,334 --> 00:28:43,209
So see the relationship, how it is.

367
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:48,459
Now this Hiranyakashipu was killed by Narasimha.

368
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:56,501
Narasimha, as you know, is the Incarnation of Shri Vishnu,

369
00:28:57,209 --> 00:29:04,167
because he had, this Hiranyakashipu had, a blessing of Brahmadeva

370
00:29:04,584 --> 00:29:10,626
that not any animal can kill him,

371
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:13,334
not any human being can kill him,

372
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:17,334
not on the land or in the sky,

373
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:21,000
and not with any weapon –

374
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
all so many blessings he had taken!

375
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,709
He had closed all the lines, you see,

376
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,083
so that nobody should kill him,

377
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,542
but actually he did not know there are ways and matters.

378
00:29:36,626 --> 00:29:40,667
So Shri Vishnu took the form of Narasimha,

379
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:44,667
is that He became the simha,

380
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:50,250
means the ‘lion’, and the lower portion of a man.

381
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:56,667
And it so happened that Hiranyakashipu asked Prahlada,

382
00:29:57,083 --> 00:30:00,209
“Where is your God?” He said, “He’s everywhere.”

383
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:04,209
So he said, “Alright, is He in this pillar?”

384
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,334
He said, “Yes, He’s in this pillar also.”

385
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:11,125
So he hit the pillar – see, the pillar

386
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,417
must have been the same style as you make, Greek style,

387
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:16,417
pillar of stone,

388
00:30:16,584 --> 00:30:20,584
so he knew that in the pillar how can anybody be, it’s a stone –

389
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,459
he hit it and the pillar broke, out of which came out Narasimha

390
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,459
with long hands and claws,

391
00:30:29,584 --> 00:30:32,250
and He took that Hiranyakashipu

392
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:37,667
and put him on His lap, because neither on the sky nor on the ground

393
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:43,000
and with His claws, because they were not weapons,

394
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,375
He opened his stomach and killed him.

395
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:50,501
So, because he was also ruling in Egypt,

396
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:55,167
the people of Egypt made their…

397
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:58,584
they were Assyrians – Assyrians are asuras,

398
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,584
they were the ones who were asuras,

399
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,250
that’s why they were called Assyrians –

400
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
so they made the statue of their god Sphinx

401
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:15,667
the other way round than Narasimha.

402
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:23,626
So the upper part of the Sphinx is that of man,

403
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:30,667
and the lower part of that statue is that of lion.

404
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,292
This is very ancient story I’m telling.

405
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:43,417
So how the Greeks went to India long time back,

406
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:46,459
because all these devas were Greeks –

407
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:50,167
and these devas were, like Indra,

408
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:53,167
what He did, and Varuna and all these things.

409
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:57,334
But I think there… because

410
00:31:57,375 --> 00:32:01,209
the whole idea got perverted, whole thing,

411
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:07,626
they could not see the proper image of their...

412
00:32:09,209 --> 00:32:14,626
of their...faces in their meditation

413
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,042
because they perverted them

414
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:20,042
so they could not see, and they saw perverted faces.

415
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:24,209
They saw them nude and that kind of thing,

416
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:27,000
which was all their own imagination

417
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,125
working, because they were indulging into all kinds of immoral things

418
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:37,209
so they made it absolutely, what you call a ...

419
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:44,584
very immoral type of relationships and things among them.

420
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:47,250
So that was their own ideas and they put it.

421
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:50,584
But also, as a result of that, they could never see

422
00:32:50,626 --> 00:32:55,667
the body or the faces of these devatas properly.

423
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:59,667
So they made them more like…

424
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:04,375
I mean quite ugly-looking faces they made.

425
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:07,292
Like I have some Poseidon they have made here

426
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:10,501
which they gave it to My husband also – it’s not at all

427
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:13,000
like Varuna, I can tell you.

428
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,167
So… and absolutely nude, you know; it’s so embarrassing.

429
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:18,667
They gave it to My husband and he didn’t know where to look,

430
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:24,167
and I just started laughing because he’s a very shy man, My husband.

431
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,209
And he had to put it in his office, you see,

432
00:33:27,209 --> 00:33:30,334
hidden somewhere and it looks very funny.

433
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:36,209
And he was saying, “Why not we use a kind of a...

434
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,042
covering with some silver?” I said, “It’s an antique

435
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:45,626
they have reproduced; you can’t do it to an antique.”

436
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,334
He said, “Alright; where should I put it?”

437
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:51,125
I said, “Put it in some corridor there.”

438
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,250
So with such expense they gave it

439
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:59,125
but My husband was quite upset about it, you see,

440
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:03,125
and every time he sees this gentleman he says,

441
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:09,709
“You know, this gentleman is no good.”

442
00:34:10,334 --> 00:34:18,209
Alright. So then, this part of the history is there.

443
00:34:18,459 --> 00:34:22,709
On that history stands the modern Greek.

444
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:29,501
So, if you see from Socrates to Christ,

445
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,375
people had evolved we think,

446
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
but they also crucified Christ,

447
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,083
so what was their evolution?

448
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:46,125
Though, if you see what Christ preached and what…

449
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:51,459
I’m sorry, what Christ preached and Socrates preached,

450
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,584
there is much difference

451
00:34:55,375 --> 00:35:00,375
because Socrates talked in parables, not openly,

452
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:05,209
while Socrates talked in a very open way,

453
00:35:05,209 --> 00:35:08,334
in an open discussion, in open understanding.

454
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:12,417
That shows only that the people could understand what He was saying.

455
00:35:12,584 --> 00:35:16,000
But still He was also killed;

456
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:20,375
Socrates also was given poison and He was also killed.

457
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:25,042
So that shows that, at that time also, the people in charge,

458
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,250
or at the helm of affairs, didn’t know what was reality.

459
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:35,501
So now, from Christ to Socrates and from Socrates to Me,

460
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:39,626
we can say this way that we are talking about it,

461
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:46,083
though Socrates came in the year – how much B.C. He was?

462
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:50,501
Yogi: About 500 years before Christ

463
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,125
500 before Christ;

464
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:58,334
so might be that Christ must have felt that Socrates,

465
00:35:58,459 --> 00:36:02,167
He talked so openly, so nicely to people

466
00:36:02,501 --> 00:36:05,459
as because He was Primordial Master.

467
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:10,334
He realised it, so He talked in parables.

468
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:15,501
He thought that, “No use talking straight like Socrates”

469
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,709
because… you see they are very straightforward people;

470
00:36:21,584 --> 00:36:25,501
the Primordial Masters have to be very, very…

471
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:29,459
they are by nature extremely straightforward.

472
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:34,375
Even today’s… those who were real gurus,

473
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:38,375
they would not accept any person,

474
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:41,292
they would throw away, they would beat people.

475
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:45,459
Even musicians in India, those who are great masters,

476
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:48,209
they would beat their disciples if they played something wrong;

477
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:50,125
like very harsh people.

478
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,667
So it was alright for Socrates also to tell things very

479
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:58,000
plain and simple and all that, but still He was killed.

480
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,292
And then Christ, who was 500 years later came.

481
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:03,584
See, He saw the point

482
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,626
that no use talking – because He came at Agya –

483
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:10,042
talking in that way.

484
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:13,209
If you tell somebody, “Don’t do like this”,

485
00:37:13,209 --> 00:37:15,542
even reason it out like Socrates did,

486
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,334
He is the master of logic, you can call Him;

487
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:22,459
the whole logic system comes from Him,

488
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:25,292
He’s a master of logic.

489
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:31,000
But despite that, it did not appeal to the logic of the people who were at the helm of affairs.

490
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:35,167
So they have no logic in their heads, you see, they are just rationalist.

491
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:39,667
Rationality is blindness but there’s no logic.

492
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:44,000
So because there is no logic they killed Him.

493
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:47,417
And Christ understood that there is no logic

494
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:50,626
with these people so better talk to them in parables.

495
00:37:51,334 --> 00:37:54,042
So He talked to them in parables,

496
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,667
but still they killed Him.

497
00:37:57,626 --> 00:38:02,459
[ Helm! ] The authorities, they couldn’t bear, they thought

498
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:06,667
He’s becoming very powerful, or whatever it was. The Jews themselves

499
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:10,292
were very funny, and they did it.

500
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:17,584
So in Sahaja Yoga, what I decided that at least

501
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:21,542
I should give Realisation to people first,

502
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:26,709
and then I can talk to them whatever I like.

503
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:30,000
Now, I’m talking to you everything

504
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:33,083
and you are understanding it because you are Realised souls,

505
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:36,083
but I cannot talk this to an ordinary person.

506
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:41,167
So we have two types of people: one who are Sahaja Yogis,

507
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:43,375
and one who are not.

508
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:47,459
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis who are not very worthy of this,

509
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:52,000
I agree, and they may just go back or something,

510
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:58,334
but you can become worthy of understanding all this knowledge

511
00:38:58,334 --> 00:39:02,334
because your Kundalini can make you so capable

512
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:06,334
and your Sahastrara so good that you can absorb what I’m saying,

513
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:10,000
and can logically see what I’m saying is true,

514
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,542
and you can also verify it, whether it is true or not.

515
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,417
So this stage of yours, I think, is the highest stage of awareness

516
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:22,501
where collectively you are understanding Me.

517
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:25,584
The situation is not so bad as that was

518
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:28,417
even at the time of Christ.

519
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:30,542
Before that, at Socrates’ time, I think,

520
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:33,542
He was the only wise man going around.

521
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,501
There was nobody else, seems to Me, had any wisdom.

522
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:39,542
Even His disciples, you see, like Plato –

523
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:43,501
he went off his head, then Aristotle went off his head.

524
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:47,209
Both of them, really,

525
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:51,125
tried to have their own arbitrary additions

526
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:53,292
which were all absolutely.

527
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:56,292
But He talked absolutely…

528
00:39:56,334 --> 00:40:00,501
Socrates talked absolutely about gods and everything,

529
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:02,626
and talked so openly.

530
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:06,417
Then, in the same way, we can say,

531
00:40:06,626 --> 00:40:09,584
the Primordial Master state is that

532
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:13,417
we have Mohammad Sahib. He was also killed;

533
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:18,459
He was also killed because He told the truth.

534
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,584
Then came Nanaka;

535
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
He was not killed but nobody bothered about Him,

536
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:30,292
and the people who really follow Him are just

537
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:33,417
in the opposite direction.

538
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:36,000
Supposing He was saying, “Come this way”;

539
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,167
so they are going in that way.

540
00:40:39,209 --> 00:40:43,125
You find even same thing with Christ;

541
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:47,459
if Christ said, “Come this way” the Christians are going that way.

542
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:51,125
Every religion is just the same.

543
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:54,000
Same with Krishna’s Gita.

544
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:57,542
Those who preach Gita are just…

545
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,209
if Krishna is standing here and saying,

546
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,083
“Come this way” Gita is saying, they are preaching Gita

547
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:05,542
going down, taking people down.

548
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:08,542
So it is common with all religions

549
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:14,292
that they have always used the name of prophets

550
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:21,501
and of all the Incarnations just to make money

551
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:28,501
and to take everybody to hell; straightforward march to hell you see.

552
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:32,000
So, now those who are alert about it,

553
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,042
and those who have seen that this is all nonsense are in Sahaja Yoga

554
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,667
and sahaja yogis can’t do that

555
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:43,667
because they have come quite a long way now on this side,

556
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:48,250
so they are going to pull out many others to that side

557
00:41:49,334 --> 00:41:52,209
instead of going themselves down.

558
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:58,083
So this is the situation today, and that’s why I say Greece

559
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,083
is a very wonderful area where we can work it out.

560
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,709
If Athena could be awakened here,

561
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:09,000
this place could be of very great help to us.

562
00:42:09,584 --> 00:42:15,209
Now there are very balanced Greek people,

563
00:42:15,209 --> 00:42:20,000
they have great sense of art because of Right-side Swadhishthana;

564
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,584
also they have lots of qualities of

565
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:32,125
understanding the worthlessness of

566
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:39,083
too much indulgences and all that. It is so.

567
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,459
But the immorality grew,

568
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:45,083
now, because they started copying Westerners;

569
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,501
otherwise the women here were very moral women.

570
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:53,167
This is only in these twenty years this change has come.

571
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:57,042
Before that the women were very moral,

572
00:42:57,042 --> 00:42:59,501
very good women lived here,

573
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,417
and some of them are now in India as I told you, they came with Alexander,

574
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
and they were very good husbands and wives and very good families.

575
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:11,375
This is only – I don’t know why – about twenty years

576
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:14,000
or twenty-five years at the most, you can say,

577
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
the Kali Yuga is showing its effects here also,

578
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,626
but it’s a very solid country and still they respect,

579
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:25,042
respect a woman who has character; respect her.

580
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:28,417
They may use a woman who has no character

581
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:30,626
but they respect the woman who has character

582
00:43:30,626 --> 00:43:33,000
and also respect the mother.

583
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:36,417
So there are lots of qualities in this country

584
00:43:36,459 --> 00:43:40,083
which are still existing,

585
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:44,626
in some places lingering, and some places effective.

586
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:49,042
So the job of Sahaja Yogis is to, somehow or other,

587
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:55,334
evoke that integrating force in them of the Athena,

588
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:58,667
and I’m sure you can purify this country.

589
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:01,250
May God bless you!

590
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:21,375
Alexander was two hundred before Christ…

591
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,292
a hundred, two hundred before Christ.

592
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:41,250
He was very much respected in India, always,

593
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:45,083
Alexander was very much respected in India,

594
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:48,334
and because he went away

595
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:52,042
and he didn’t take away anything from India.

596
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:57,501
Like any other invaders who came, who just looted us, he did not.

597
00:44:58,542 --> 00:45:00,709
I think he got quite detached

598
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:04,375
after coming to India. Anybody who has

599
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:08,542
come to invade India, and has really gained something

600
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:11,667
out of the spirituality of India, was Alexander;

601
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
otherwise the English lived for three hundred in India,

602
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,167
three hundred years.

603
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:19,125
Nothing went into their heads, nothing.

604
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Three hundred years! Can you believe it?

605
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:27,042
They used to laugh at everything, they used to make fun of everything,

606
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,250
nothing went into their heads.

607
00:45:31,167 --> 00:45:34,709
But so many Greeks stayed on because they liked India very much,

608
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:37,626
so they stayed back, they wouldn’t come back.

609
00:45:37,626 --> 00:45:41,626
So many are there even now living in the forests.

610
00:45:43,042 --> 00:45:47,501
So, this is something, is the sensitivity, the awareness,

611
00:45:47,501 --> 00:45:51,000
which has grown through times in the Greek people.

612
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:54,417
You can see in the character of Alexander, how he was.

613
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:58,125
There’s a poet in India called Chandav Rai,

614
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:02,000
who was at the time of Alexander.

615
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:06,709
Alexander brought him here, honoured him, kept him here,

616
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:10,209
he was here, and he wrote poems about Alexander,

617
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:13,375
about his greatness and things, praised him so well.

618
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:18,626
I mean I can’t think of English people carrying any Indian as a poet

619
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,167
to England;

620
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,167
there’s no question. I mean, they didn’t…

621
00:46:24,167 --> 00:46:27,167
and the sign of awareness is this, that

622
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:30,501
you don’t respect anybody else, you say, “Oh, I am the greatest”.

623
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:35,334
Then you cannot see the goodness of other people.

624
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:40,125
Same with Portuguese. Of course, Vasco de Gama was a simple man

625
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:43,459
and when he came first to India, he saw Indians

626
00:46:43,459 --> 00:46:47,250
and he went to Goa and he saw the temple of the Goddess

627
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:49,000
there, is the Shanta Durga’s,

628
00:46:49,083 --> 00:46:51,042
so he went back and told his king that,

629
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:54,167
“They are all Christians because they follow the Mother.

630
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:56,083
They are not Muslims”.

631
00:46:58,459 --> 00:47:00,042
So simple he was.

632
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:03,250
“There’s no need to make them Christians.

633
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,167
They are already Christians because they follow Mother”.

634
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:08,042
He was a nice man.

635
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:11,167
But Portuguese also never learned anything much,

636
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:13,584
but still certain respect they showed, like

637
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,375
the name of Bombay is Mumbai.

638
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,083
They still call it Mumbai.

639
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:21,125
many words Mumbai

640
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:25,375
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi, Mumbai  is the name.

641
00:47:25,501 --> 00:47:28,167
Means she is the Mother of Mumba.

642
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:29,667
Like ‘ayi’ is the Mother,

643
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:32,125
so they call it Mumbai –

644
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:34,375
is the name of the Goddess.

645
00:47:34,584 --> 00:47:36,584
So they didn’t want to change it.

646
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:40,125
And in Portugal, when I went, they were saying “Mumbai”.

647
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:42,250
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi is the name.

648
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,501
“After all, it’s the name of the Goddess; isn’t it?”

649
00:47:44,584 --> 00:47:46,083
I said, “It is.”

650
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:50,000
But the English came, called it “Bombay”- finished.

651
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:56,501
So you see the… see the awareness,

652
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:59,167
you can see the awareness of people

653
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:04,542
because they were so aware about the serenity,

654
00:48:04,584 --> 00:48:08,167
about the holiness, about the auspiciousness and all that,

655
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:10,042
so they said, “How can we call it Bombay

656
00:48:10,042 --> 00:48:12,584
because it is the name of the Goddess?”

657
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:16,626
Just think- the depth, no? “We cannot call.”

658
00:48:17,042 --> 00:48:19,292
But the English could have gone and found out

659
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:23,167
what is this place called, why is it called Mumbai.

660
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,459
But they did not.

661
00:48:24,459 --> 00:48:27,459
But even if they had found, I don’t think they would have

662
00:48:27,501 --> 00:48:30,167
kept it as Mumbai. They would not have

663
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:33,667
because, you see, that respect

664
00:48:34,209 --> 00:48:36,542
for serenity and all these things,

665
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,334
somehow or other, in these people who ruled us, it was not there.

666
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:45,292
Now the children of Britain

667
00:48:45,501 --> 00:48:49,042
are better, are very different, very different.

668
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:52,667
But those who ruled us had no respect at all.

669
00:48:54,083 --> 00:49:00,209
They would only go to church, and nothing, no respect.

670
00:49:01,209 --> 00:49:05,209
While the Greeks had always respect for Indians,

671
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,375
they came with respect.

672
00:49:08,584 --> 00:49:14,542
Now, the respect, also, is a kind of an awareness within us.

673
00:49:15,501 --> 00:49:17,501
And now, as the time has passed,

674
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:20,083
I find Britishers have respect for others,

675
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:23,667
they’re respecting, many.

676
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:27,125
I mean, I would not say all, but quite a lot, isn’t it.

677
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:31,083
Well, what do you say? He has not met any.

678
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:40,375
Yes, that’s the part lacking- respect.

679
00:49:40,709 --> 00:49:43,209
That is the part lacking in England.

680
00:49:43,334 --> 00:49:46,667
And imagine in the heart, if there is no respect,

681
00:49:47,042 --> 00:49:49,375
then what sort of a heart it must be?

682
00:49:50,209 --> 00:49:53,209
The whole world can get ruined by that heart.

683
00:49:56,417 --> 00:50:03,584
So that’s the thing – one has to create respect:

684
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:10,167
respecting others, respecting their culture,

685
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:14,292
respecting their lifestyle.

686
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:20,042
But, I mean whatever you may say, but theoretically it is there;

687
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:24,000
may not be in practice. Theoretically it is working,

688
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:27,209
because you’re not supposed to insult anybody

689
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:30,584
who is from the ethnic group and all that is there legally,

690
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:33,626
theoretically; but in practice it is not,

691
00:50:33,626 --> 00:50:36,626
I agree; but theoretically it is working.

692
00:50:37,292 --> 00:50:42,125
You can’t insult somebody because he’s a black man or he’s

693
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:45,709
an ethnic group, you cannot, under law, you cannot do it.

694
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:49,125
So that is there but just theory.

695
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:53,042
But still, awareness-wise also, people are aware.

696
00:50:53,209 --> 00:50:58,626
I know of so many of them who were sitting in the sun

697
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
and fasting for South Africa.

698
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:05,709
So between the South African awareness

699
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:09,417
and British awareness, we must say, we should be proud

700
00:51:09,542 --> 00:51:13,542
that in British awareness there is lot of sense,

701
00:51:14,501 --> 00:51:19,334
and that sense, once it comes to the point of respecting others,

702
00:51:19,459 --> 00:51:22,459
I think it can transform the whole world.

703
00:51:23,042 --> 00:51:26,501
But I don’t know how I have to do it, I’ve tried.

704
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,417
It has to be respect.

705
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,375
It is not insulting now,

706
00:51:36,584 --> 00:51:40,042
but it is not positive respect.

707
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:44,125
So one has to learn how to positively respect;

708
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:47,709
at least Sahaja Yogis must be positively respected.

709
00:51:47,709 --> 00:51:50,626
This is what I have been talking about,

710
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:54,417
about Buddha, about truth, about respect.

711
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:59,375
But once you know that they are Sahaja Yogis, one has to respect.

712
00:51:59,709 --> 00:52:02,125
And this one has to learn from the Greeks

713
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:05,125
because still they have a sense of respect.

714
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:12,083
They know how to respect, isn’t it?

715
00:52:13,292 --> 00:52:17,459
That part is there, that one has to learn.

716
00:52:17,459 --> 00:52:21,459
Even the Egyptians are, and also the Chinese,

717
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:28,542
because out of all these years of traditional growth,

718
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:32,375
they have realised one thing: that if you have to really

719
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:36,334
exist in this world you have to learn how to respect others.

720
00:52:41,334 --> 00:52:43,709
And respect is something from your heart.

721
00:52:44,292 --> 00:52:48,125
Like the Japanese have no respect for anyone

722
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,542
but they’ll go and bow ten times,

723
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:55,292
don’t know when to stop if they bow, and if you bow they’ll go on,

724
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:58,459
permanently, so it’s best if you stop.

725
00:52:58,459 --> 00:53:01,709
But it’s artificial; it’s not real.

726
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:08,542
So it should come from your innate being to respect others,

727
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:12,417
and when that works out then

728
00:53:12,417 --> 00:53:16,125
your awareness has definitely reached a very high state,

729
00:53:16,334 --> 00:53:21,250
high state of understanding of Divinity.

730
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:26,501
So then you come to a point of respecting the Adi Shakti

731
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:31,125
and then, when you have respect, it’s not artificial respect,

732
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:34,667
it’s not artificial, it should be from your heart.

733
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:38,667
And once you start doing that your awareness will improve.

734
00:53:39,334 --> 00:53:41,584
And that it’s not what you get,

735
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,167
it’s not what you have,

736
00:53:44,292 --> 00:53:49,292
but what you give to yourself by respecting.

737
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:56,417
And this respect in which transform you completely, I can tell you,

738
00:53:56,501 --> 00:53:58,626
because there’s a big understanding

739
00:53:58,626 --> 00:54:00,709
now between you and the Divine,

740
00:54:01,042 --> 00:54:03,501
and I’m sure everything will work out very well.

741
00:54:03,584 --> 00:54:07,584
The way the Deities respect the Adi Shakti, if you also

742
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:13,042
learn that respect, then things will work out.

743
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,209
And I think Greeks will lead us very well,

744
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:18,709
the whole of Europe, in this respect; I’m sure about it.

745
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,459
May God bless you!
