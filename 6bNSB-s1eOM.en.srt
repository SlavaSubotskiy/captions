1
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:39,937
﻿I bow

2
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:42,859
to all the seekers of Truth

3
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,543
and the Truth

4
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:48,665
that we are seeking

5
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,246
has to be achieved,

6
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:56,511
understood and felt

7
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:00,577
through a very open mind.

8
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:05,588
You cannot conceive the Truth

9
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:07,885
with your mental activity,

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,100
and you cannot form your own ideas and conventions

11
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,700
about it.

12
00:01:17,843 --> 00:01:19,603
Like a scientist,

13
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,233
you have to keep your mind open

14
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:24,434
to achieve it.

15
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:26,694
Moreover

16
00:01:27,568 --> 00:01:30,253
it is an evolutionary process,

17
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:31,753
the process

18
00:01:31,953 --> 00:01:34,635
by which you have become a human being.

19
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,460
And logically, it should follow,

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,940
that you cannot put in any effort

21
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:49,119
to become the higher personality.

22
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:53,511
You have put in no effort

23
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,222
for your evolution so far.

24
00:01:57,104 --> 00:01:58,604
Thirdly,

25
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,387
you have paid no money

26
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,628
to become a human being.

27
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:05,075
God doesn’t understand money.

28
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:07,775
This is created by human beings.

29
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,330
God has no sense of money

30
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:13,701
and He doesn’t know also, perhaps, how maddening it is

31
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:15,269
for human beings.

32
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,414
So you cannot pay for it.

33
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,574
It’s something ridiculous

34
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:24,575
to think that you can pay for your ascent,

35
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:27,993
or to say that you can go into a course

36
00:02:28,193 --> 00:02:29,828
of realization,

37
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:33,544
because it is a living process

38
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,008
of your evolution – a living process.

39
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:40,135
If we understand the living process,

40
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,530
you will understand Sahaja Yoga much better.

41
00:02:45,369 --> 00:02:48,588
If you have to sprout a seed,

42
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,195
you just put it in the Mother Earth

43
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:54,074
and She sprouts it.

44
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,127
How much money do you give Her?

45
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:00,288
She doesn’t understand money.

46
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,495
She only knows

47
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:05,271
how to sprout the seed.

48
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,382
So when you

49
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:09,740
put the seed in the Mother Earth,

50
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,649
it sprouts spontaneously, sahaja.

51
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:15,856
Saha means with,

52
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:17,556
ja means born.

53
00:03:17,817 --> 00:03:21,308
It is born within you the capacity to sprout;

54
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,380
the capacity to awaken your Kundalini is born with you.

55
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,212
But it has to be

56
00:03:28,412 --> 00:03:31,009
the Mother Earth who has to do the job.

57
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:33,538
Like every seed has

58
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,531
all the maps

59
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:39,140
of its past and all its future.

60
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:42,273
You have those maps within yourself

61
00:03:42,843 --> 00:03:45,757
and once you just

62
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:50,107
become

63
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:54,462
capable of getting enlightened,

64
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:56,743
you get your enlightenment.

65
00:03:56,943 --> 00:04:00,305
But we should not put any diffidence into your mind.

66
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:02,034
Many people start thinking

67
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:03,876
that you have to do the cleansing first,

68
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:06,235
and then you get realization.

69
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:09,148
When you are

70
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:13,040
inside the dirt, how can you cleanse?

71
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:18,736
So this Sahaja Yoga today is of this way

72
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:22,068
that first you get out of it,

73
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,060
first have a little light in your lamp,

74
00:04:25,742 --> 00:04:28,253
The light is there and the lamp, if it is dirty,

75
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:31,651
it is easier to clean the lamp which is enlightened

76
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:34,923
than to clean a lamp which has no enlightenment.

77
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:38,492
That’s why first

78
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,723
you get your Self realization.

79
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:45,132
That is very important before

80
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:47,072
we deal with anything else,

81
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:50,516
that you must get your Self realization first.

82
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:53,420
This is what Christ has said that

83
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,728
you are to be born again.

84
00:04:57,148 --> 00:05:00,646
He didn’t mean some sort of an artificial baptism. He never meant that.

85
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:02,078
How could He mean that?

86
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,705
Logically, you must understand, that if He was Truth

87
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,788
he would not tell that you can have a false

88
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:10,849
baptism.

89
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,600
But what He has said is that by this Spirit,

90
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,733
your Spirit will be awakened.

91
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:17,828
It means a person

92
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,518
who has got his Spirit enlightened

93
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,538
can enlighten

94
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,852
a light,

95
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:27,652
Or a candle which is already enlightened

96
00:05:27,852 --> 00:05:29,912
can enlighten another light.

97
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,048
But what has it done? Nothing.

98
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,876
It had the light, the other one was ready,

99
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:37,579
so the light passes from one light to another.

100
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:39,292
There is no obligation,

101
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:43,319
there is no greatness about it, there’s nothing special done.

102
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:46,933
So as far as you are concerned, you are all ready

103
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:49,596
today to have your realization.

104
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:54,020
Many people I have met so far, in the West ‘specially,

105
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:56,841
want to escape the Truth

106
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:59,180
because they say that Mother,

107
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:01,219
we have to cleanse ourselves.

108
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,100
You go ahead with it.

109
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,456
How many years you have been doing that,

110
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,601
how many lives, how many ages?

111
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,202
Now stop it. It’s finished now.

112
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:14,279
Better have your enlightenment and then see how you can

113
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:18,957
very nicely clean yourself and see what’s wrong with you.

114
00:06:19,157 --> 00:06:20,332
Moreover,

115
00:06:20,532 --> 00:06:23,600
it is very difficult to tell anyone,

116
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:25,139
even if you see

117
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,913
the dirt in a person, that this is dirty.

118
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:31,528
It is better that, Supposing
there’s something wrong with this shawl.

119
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:34,740
I’d better take it out, see for myself what’s wrong with it

120
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,353
and I can cleanse it.

121
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:39,625
In the same way you have to get out of yourself,

122
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:42,979
to see for yourself what’s wrong with you

123
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:46,141
and that is how it will be much easier

124
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:49,239
for you to clean if you know how to clean yourself.

125
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,989
So you become the person

126
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:53,692
who is the Spirit.

127
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:55,884
The Spirit sees

128
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:59,391
the defects in you and the Spirit guides you

129
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:01,465
and cleanses you completely.

130
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:03,340
There is no more guide needed

131
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,966
or no gurus needed. You become your own guru.

132
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:16,762
So many kinds of people have come

133
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:20,419
to sell their goods in the market.

134
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,310
You cannot sell God

135
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:27,038
and the one who lives on your earnings is a parasite.

136
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:30,754
He cannot be a holy person or a saintly person.

137
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:34,821
Christ did not take any money from people did He?

138
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,155
He was born as a carpenter’s son

139
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,763
and He worked as a carpenter’s son.

140
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:42,220
But what is the purpose

141
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:45,218
of His advent?

142
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,960
What is the purpose of my coming to Boston is this:

143
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,348
that we all deserve

144
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,566
this higher state.

145
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,191
It is all your own. It is your right.

146
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,379
I should say I’m like a banker

147
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,558
and I have to cash your checks.

148
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:08,528
The purpose of this happening is

149
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:10,484
complete transformation.

150
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:13,308
The transformation has to take place.

151
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,284
What is the problem

152
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:18,973
of the world today is a moral crisis.

153
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,852
People are morally,

154
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:25,168
absolutely fagged out, tired.

155
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:28,028
They have lost all their discretion.

156
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:31,217
They don’t know what to do; they are so confused

157
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:33,961
whether this is true or that is true

158
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:38,019
because we live in relative world. Everything is relative.

159
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,212
This will do, that will do. Everybody’s compromising.

160
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:43,321
They don’t know what is absolute

161
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:47,521
because we have not achieved our absolute within ourselves.

162
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:49,720
Now the most remarkable thing

163
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,610
about the absolute, that is the Spirit is

164
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,095
that the absolute

165
00:08:54,295 --> 00:08:57,118
is the one that is collectively conscious.

166
00:08:58,537 --> 00:09:01,216
That’s the one that can feel

167
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,018
another person.

168
00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:06,196
That’s the one which knows

169
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:08,388
about everybody else.

170
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:12,299
That’s the one which knows also about yourself.

171
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,649
So far as a human being,

172
00:09:14,849 --> 00:09:18,121
the Spirit has not come into your consciousness.

173
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:24,028
It’s not yet enlightened, means

174
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:27,720
your consciousness hasn’t got the light of your Spirit.

175
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,120
The Spirit is in your Heart

176
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:35,727
and this Spirit is just watching you as a witness.

177
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:37,442
It has not entered

178
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:40,671
into your consciousness, into your attention,

179
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,195
and because of that,

180
00:09:42,396 --> 00:09:44,583
you do not know what is absolute,

181
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:46,883
what is collective consciousness.

182
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:50,661
When it happens to you, it happens in your awareness.

183
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:53,852
It doesn’t happen in your mental conceptions like,

184
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,775
I can give you a big book to read
and then you become something great?

185
00:09:58,017 --> 00:10:00,132
Your own consciousness,

186
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:01,937
which is a human consciousness,

187
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:04,638
becomes a higher consciousness,

188
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:08,876
which becomes collectively 
conscious, means it is an actualization.

189
00:10:09,814 --> 00:10:12,957
Like a person who is a human being

190
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:15,985
can feel the dirt and filth,

191
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,543
the colors, the beauty,

192
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,947
but an animal cannot.

193
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,576
So something is happening in our consciousness, actually,

194
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:28,276
that we can feel the filth.

195
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:33,780
In the same way, when you become absolute,

196
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:37,212
everything that is not absolute

197
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:38,890
starts negating itself.

198
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,590
It just disappears,

199
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:44,552
and you become absolute yourself, which is the Truth.

200
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:47,385
You become absolute joy

201
00:10:47,902 --> 00:10:51,096
and you become absolute consciousness.

202
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,096
So far, the consciousness has moved to the human stage

203
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:59,310
in such a way that we have not felt

204
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,510
that we have moved higher

205
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,908
because we were not made like that.

206
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,060
At the human stage only we are made in a special way. If you see,

207
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,936
here as you can see it clearly,

208
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:14,516
that from the left side

209
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,708
there’s a blue balloon-like stuff rising.

210
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:22,096
This blue thing is nothing

211
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:24,600
but all of our conditioning’s

212
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,772
which becomes what we call

213
00:11:26,972 --> 00:11:28,612
in Sanskrit as manasa,

214
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:31,912
but very closely we can call it as super ego

215
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:35,855
where we are conditioned: Don’t do this, don’t do that.

216
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,293
We are born, say, as Americans.

217
00:11:40,642 --> 00:11:43,451
I mean it’s not true. You are a human being.

218
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:46,986
God never created America.
It is we who have created America,

219
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:48,376
England, these things.

220
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:50,987
He just created
one beautiful world.

221
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:52,921
So then you are Americans.

222
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:55,052
Identification starts like that.

223
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:57,991
Then you go ahead and you think we are

224
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:00,322
Christians or Hindus or Muslims.

225
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:01,831
Then you go ahead with that

226
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:05,132
and all these misidentifications start accumulating within us

227
00:12:05,332 --> 00:12:08,369
and all of them form an artificial thing

228
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,857
called as superego in your head.

229
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:13,134
All the conditioning,

230
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:15,551
all the possessions, all the opposition’s,

231
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:18,834
all sorts of things that you gathered

232
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:21,127
in many lives can be there

233
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:23,059
called as superego.

234
00:12:24,456 --> 00:12:27,885
On the other side we have got the ego,

235
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:32,441
the one that we

236
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:35,649
accumulate within ourselves or create within ourselves

237
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:37,758
by our activity

238
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,887
because we think we have done this,

239
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:42,601
is the ego.

240
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:46,067
Actually human beings cannot do anything.

241
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:50,781
What they do is to explore whatever is dead.

242
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,390
They cannot do living work.

243
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,738
They cannot transfer one flower into fruit,

244
00:12:55,938 --> 00:12:57,777
even one flower into fruit.

245
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:00,707
All this living work is done by someone.

246
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:03,441
We do not think how we are created,

247
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:05,768
how this beautiful human being is created.

248
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:07,569
We haven’t got humility

249
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:11,280
to understand that this
something great has happened to us,

250
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,151
that there is some sort of a force,

251
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:16,225
some living force,

252
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:19,667
some very kindly,

253
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:23,125
loving force that has done this.

254
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:25,968
We never even felt how we were created like that.

255
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:29,668
Without any pains we are created as human beings.

256
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:31,952
This great living work

257
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:33,867
that is happening within us,

258
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:35,843
who has done this living work?

259
00:13:36,043 --> 00:13:37,482
How has it come?

260
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:40,960
We have never felt that all-pervading

261
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,838
Power of God

262
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:45,000
that is doing all these things.

263
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,760
Not only that but

264
00:13:48,376 --> 00:13:49,701
it sorts out things;

265
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:52,694
it’s such a beautiful mechanism.

266
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:56,280
Like a mango tree

267
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,827
will give you mangoes.

268
00:13:58,027 --> 00:14:00,604
If it’s an ananas tree it will give you ananas.

269
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:04,599
Like that you have all kinds of different

270
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:08,804
sorting out to such an extent
that your child will look like you.

271
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:11,733
Who does all this sorting out?

272
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:14,948
All this Power that does

273
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:17,142
all the living work.

274
00:14:17,342 --> 00:14:20,112
The scientists also have not done their [unclear].

275
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:24,229
They’re honest but they’re not so educated,

276
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:27,956
they’re not so well informed

277
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:30,500
and their seeking is very limited

278
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,534
because their brains are limited,

279
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:35,654
their mental capacity is limited.

280
00:14:36,117 --> 00:14:37,957
If they have to go further,

281
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:41,645
they have to become higher personalities to be able to see

282
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:43,452
how we are created,

283
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:47,152
how do we exist and how this living force acts.

284
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:52,484
Now, for us,

285
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,098
as we take everything for granted.

286
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,980
We do not even think about it

287
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,258
is a good thing. Otherwise, we might go mad

288
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,660
thinking that we do not know about the Power

289
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,816
that does the living work.

290
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:11,337
So we have an idea that we do this work and that work.

291
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,572
What do we do? Supposing a tree is dead

292
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:15,412
we make this floor,

293
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:18,586
church, this, that – all stones.

294
00:15:19,103 --> 00:15:21,095
It’s dead from the dead.

295
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,423
We have just changed the forms from dead to the dead.

296
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,823
What special thing have you done?

297
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:30,630
When we start thinking that we have done something,

298
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,404
that is how we develop an ego.

299
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:36,956
Like people going in an airplane were told

300
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:39,502
not to take too much luggage in a village.

301
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:43,011
They talked it’s better to reduce the weight

302
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:44,652
of the plane,

303
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:47,412
so they put the weight on their heads,

304
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:48,891
sitting in the plane.

305
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:52,299
In the same way we are putting the weight on our heads,

306
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:55,416
thinking that we have to do this job, that job.

307
00:15:55,616 --> 00:15:58,663
The one who has created you,
the one who has made you a human being,

308
00:15:58,863 --> 00:16:00,858
is going to make you higher.

309
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:03,366
Why do you take the load upon yourself?

310
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:05,620
That’s why Mr. Ego sits on your head

311
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,472
like a heavy weight, “I have to do this. I have to do that,”

312
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:12,648
without understanding the plan of the Divine.

313
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:17,684
That’s all we have, ego and superego sitting on our head,

314
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:19,446
and we start feeling

315
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,948
that we are something great.

316
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,500
Now this happening has taken place within us

317
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,481
because we are human beings.

318
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:30,019
A dog doesn’t have responsibilities as such.

319
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:33,204
Whatever he does he does through his responses

320
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:34,613
through its superego.

321
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:36,824
But human being has developed the ego

322
00:16:37,024 --> 00:16:39,790
and because of that his brain is closed now.

323
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,109
He is like an egg.

324
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:44,406
Now this egg

325
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:47,988
has been ‘specially
made to become the bird

326
00:16:48,816 --> 00:16:51,285
and that transformation has to take place

327
00:16:51,485 --> 00:16:52,980
which is all built in within you.

328
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,160
You have all these powers within you.

329
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,575
It has just to be clicked

330
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:59,100
and the warmth

331
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,578
of the love

332
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:03,046
of the Divine has to work it out

333
00:17:03,246 --> 00:17:05,382
so that you become the bird

334
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:08,086
of complete, absolute freedom.

335
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:10,469
This is what

336
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,968
Christ wanted to inform us

337
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:15,688
by His resurrection

338
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:19,041
and when we have

339
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:21,988
Easter you know that we have eggs.

340
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:23,932
The egg is suggesting

341
00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:26,105
that you are the egg today

342
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:29,886
but on an Easter Christ, as He became the bird,

343
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:33,597
you also become the birds.

344
00:17:33,797 --> 00:17:36,879
And so we should say the time has come for all of you

345
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,358
to become the birds.

346
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,621
But it is impossible for human beings

347
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:44,243
because they’re such made,
I don’t know how, especially in the West,

348
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:46,958
to understand that there could be somebody who is

349
00:17:47,158 --> 00:17:50,419
genuinely interested in the well-being of others.

350
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:53,505
They cannot understand because of their

351
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,564
relative ideas.

352
00:17:55,764 --> 00:17:58,763
They cannot understand that there should be someone

353
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:00,567
who should do this job;

354
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:03,092
who should communicate

355
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,239
with people who are seekers,

356
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,281
to give them their Truth

357
00:18:07,481 --> 00:18:09,732
and to give them their transformation,

358
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:12,052
to put them up on
their consciousness

359
00:18:12,252 --> 00:18:14,293
as realized souls.

360
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:18,156
Now, actually, in the movement of consciousness,

361
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:20,895
when human beings were born, what they started

362
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:24,152
sorting out everything on mental level,

363
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:25,727
everything on mental level.

364
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:27,812
And whatever works on a mental level

365
00:18:28,012 --> 00:18:30,578
works out in a linear manner.

366
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:33,887
Like there is no sustenance in that.

367
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:36,812
If something starts moving in a linear way it falls off,

368
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:38,321
again recoils back.

369
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:40,251
That’s why today we are shocked.

370
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:41,932
We have evolved so much,

371
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:45,260
we have developed so much,
we are supposed to be developed people,

372
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,803
and then how is it we are on the brink of a shock?

373
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:52,720
Why are you so upset? What has gone wrong with us?

374
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,196
Where did we go wrong?

375
00:18:54,396 --> 00:18:58,293
Because we tried to solve all our problems through mental efforts.

376
00:18:58,731 --> 00:19:01,152
Anything – take your politics, take your economics

377
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:03,430
– is nothing but a mental effort.

378
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,680
For example, economics says that wants,

379
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,971
in general, are not satiable.

380
00:19:09,535 --> 00:19:12,909
That means there must be some wants that are satiable

381
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:16,093
and we live in the relative wants which are not satiable.

382
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:18,085
Now what is that want

383
00:19:18,285 --> 00:19:21,873
which is absolute, which will satisfy us?

384
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:24,892
And that want is represented here

385
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:27,763
as this triangular.

386
00:19:29,006 --> 00:19:30,803
In the triangular bone you can see

387
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,541
the Kundalini that is the pure desire within you,

388
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,620
the pure desire to be one with the Divine.

389
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,785
Unless and until that desire manifests,

390
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:43,966
all your wants will be changing from one to another.

391
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,137
Like today, you would like to have a house,

392
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:48,001
tomorrow you would like to have a car

393
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:49,770
and day after tomorrow something else,

394
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,922
then a helicopter, then an
aeroplane – you can go on like that.

395
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:55,278
But actually to have

396
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:57,540
all your wants satisfied

397
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,508
there is one want

398
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:02,196
which is kept sleeping, as they say,

399
00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:06,068
because it has not manifested in the triangular bone

400
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,412
which is to be awakened,

401
00:20:08,612 --> 00:20:10,249
which is to be manifested.

402
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:13,958
Now, just imagine this bone is called as sacrum.

403
00:20:14,158 --> 00:20:17,193
It means Greeks also knew that it is a sacred bone.

404
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:18,996
That is why they call it as sacrum.

405
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:21,613
You can see the rising of the Kundalini,

406
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:25,551
you can see the pulsation of the Kundalini, you can feel the

407
00:20:27,228 --> 00:20:30,563
percussion of the Kundalini like,
“Lub, dub, lub, dub,” as the Heart is.

408
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,418
In some people it is quite a lot

409
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:33,993
and then you can feel the

410
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,443
cool breeze coming out of your head.

411
00:20:36,643 --> 00:20:38,551
Now what is this Kundalini within us?

412
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:40,652
The Spirit is in your Heart

413
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:43,324
but what about the Kundalini? Who is She?

414
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:45,340
She is the Holy Ghost.

415
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,340
She is the representation or the reflection of the Holy Ghost.

416
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,013
But if you ask anybody else

417
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:54,035
they say, “No, we don’t know about Holy Ghost. It’s a mystery.”

418
00:20:54,235 --> 00:20:57,543
In Sahaja Yoga, nothing is a mystery. Everything can be explained.

419
00:20:57,743 --> 00:20:59,839
Now what is the Holy Ghost is?

420
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:02,540
The Holy Ghost is the primordial Mother.

421
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,626
It's the Mother, primordial Mother.

422
00:21:05,826 --> 00:21:09,612
But people never talked about Mother.
They talked of the Father and the Son.

423
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:13,397
Now imagine, a father and a son and no mother.

424
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,850
It is absurd.

425
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:19,646
Have you seen any father and a son without a mother?

426
00:21:20,506 --> 00:21:22,544
Such an absurd situation comes in

427
00:21:22,745 --> 00:21:23,976
that people accepted

428
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:26,696
because it’s all mental. Somebody tells you, “No, it’s a mystery,

429
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:29,101
there’s no Mother,” and people accepted it.

430
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:30,684
But there has to be a Mother

431
00:21:30,884 --> 00:21:32,766
and this is the time of Aquarius

432
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:34,905
what we call in Sanskrit as Kumbha,

433
00:21:35,105 --> 00:21:38,874
meaning the Aquarius is the Kundalini,

434
00:21:39,074 --> 00:21:40,674
where She nourishes,

435
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:43,713
where She cures you, She redeems you,

436
00:21:43,913 --> 00:21:45,466
She guides you, counsels you

437
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,901
– and this is the time of the Mother.

438
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:50,994
We had the time of the Father, then of the Son,

439
00:21:51,194 --> 00:21:53,530
and now this is the time of the Mother

440
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,241
where She has to nourish you,

441
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:56,956
where She has to take you

442
00:21:57,156 --> 00:21:59,862
to your ultimate goal that is the Spirit.

443
00:22:02,225 --> 00:22:03,652
The consciousness itself,

444
00:22:03,852 --> 00:22:06,525
the way we have been moving in other directions, have been

445
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,345
like people think that if

446
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:12,072
a woman starts fighting for her life

447
00:22:13,155 --> 00:22:16,255
and then she’s asserting the femininity.

448
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:17,855
She’s not.

449
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:21,839
What I’m saying is not

450
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:25,080
meant for women or men. It is meant for every one of us,

451
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,394
that we have to become like a mother.

452
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:31,432
Like a Divine Mother,

453
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:34,485
like a person who can nourish people,

454
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,872
who can give them love, affection,

455
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:43,012
attention, perseverance, forebearing.

456
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,836
This is only possible for a mother to do it

457
00:22:47,036 --> 00:22:50,375
and that motherhood should be awakened in every human being.

458
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:52,720
I would say Abraham Lincoln you had

459
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,000
was a great person like that.

460
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,732
After that also we have had so many great people in this world

461
00:22:58,932 --> 00:23:02,469
who have been like that. In our country we had Mahatma Gandhi.

462
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:06,017
We had many people of that temperament

463
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:08,252
who were soothing,

464
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:10,932
nourishing, curing

465
00:23:11,132 --> 00:23:13,080
and helping others

466
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,052
in such a way as a mother

467
00:23:15,252 --> 00:23:17,666
would like to nourish her own children.

468
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:20,358
So the sense of nourishment has to come within us

469
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:22,486
but we have no power of nourishment

470
00:23:22,686 --> 00:23:23,974
and that only comes

471
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:27,028
when your Spirit starts manifesting through you.

472
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:30,172
When this Power rises, She manifests

473
00:23:30,372 --> 00:23:32,473
Her power of nourishment.

474
00:23:32,673 --> 00:23:35,258
She actually nourishes your chakras,

475
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:38,274
She’s the one who nourishes those subtle centers

476
00:23:38,474 --> 00:23:41,580
which look after the gross centers,

477
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,302
She’s the one who cures,

478
00:23:43,502 --> 00:23:45,716
She is the one who guides

479
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:49,160
because She informs you what’s wrong with you

480
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,429
and She’s the one who councils you.

481
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:54,347
Because once you become collectively conscious

482
00:23:54,547 --> 00:23:57,461
then you start feeling the cool breeze in your hand

483
00:23:57,661 --> 00:23:59,720
and this becomes like a computer.

484
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,549
You become a computer of which you become the master.

485
00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:06,033
You are already a computer, if you understand,

486
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:09,369
because in a computer if you put something in it,

487
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,937
it cannot just see and say, it has to think.

488
00:24:13,137 --> 00:24:15,718
But we can just see and say things.

489
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:18,026
As soon as you see, we know what it is.

490
00:24:18,226 --> 00:24:20,093
So we are already a wonderful computer,

491
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,245
which no scientist can produce.

492
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:24,220
But we become even

493
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,820
conscious of that computer

494
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,091
and become master of that computer

495
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:31,179
so that we know everything about

496
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:35,190
whatever is not known to us unknown. All absolute problems

497
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,910
can be asked and we can find out what’s wrong with you.

498
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:42,482
But it is not that the consciousness moves like a pendulum.

499
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:46,400
Like a woman fighting a man

500
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,465
and becoming egoistical and fighting and shouting

501
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:51,650
and then behaving like a man.

502
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,657
Or a man becoming like a woman. It’s a pendulum.

503
00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:57,308
But you move in a spiral way,

504
00:24:57,683 --> 00:25:00,581
in a spiral way to rise higher

505
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:03,530
and that higher point you start seeing the things.

506
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,373
Like a spring has a spiral you have 
seen and it has a sustenance within it.

507
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:08,786
It’s not linear.

508
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:11,806
When the spring loses its sustenance it has become linear.

509
00:25:12,006 --> 00:25:15,214
Like in the peptones in the pancreas

510
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:17,447
are all spiraling…

511
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:21,348
and human beings, though they have created so many peptones

512
00:25:21,548 --> 00:25:24,060
with all kinds of amino acids and all that put into it,

513
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,028
they are not even five percent

514
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:29,623
equal to what natural peptones we have.

515
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:33,404
But we make them linear by our wrong doings

516
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:35,635
and then the peptones become linear

517
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:38,358
and they lose their biological effects

518
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:40,584
because they become lifeless.

519
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:43,631
In the same way our ascent

520
00:25:43,831 --> 00:25:45,890
takes place in a spiral way

521
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,601
and rises higher than ones where it is.

522
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:50,418
It doesn’t move like a pendulum: a man

523
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:52,835
becoming a woman, a woman becoming like a man.

524
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:56,359
But what happens is you develop a higher consciousness

525
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,473
and in that higher consciousness you start

526
00:25:59,673 --> 00:26:02,852
understanding that now you have become the light.

527
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:05,348
Now what is the light?

528
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:08,571
Still you have to make the light, you work hard, you put it right.

529
00:26:08,771 --> 00:26:11,489
But once it has made the light, you put it on top.

530
00:26:11,689 --> 00:26:13,189
So it guides.

531
00:26:13,548 --> 00:26:15,191
Then it becomes the guru,

532
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:17,440
it becomes the guiding factor.

533
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,272
It becomes everything. That’s how you become.

534
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,190
So we have got the left side of desire

535
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,100
and the right side of action.

536
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,878
These left side and right side of action can be compared

537
00:26:31,346 --> 00:26:33,362
with the brake and

538
00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:37,468
the accelerator in a car, to understand it on a very gross

539
00:26:39,104 --> 00:26:40,503
example.

540
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:42,499
What happens that when we start

541
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:44,857
learning how to drive,

542
00:26:45,163 --> 00:26:46,534
we get into the car,

543
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:49,356
we use both these powers,

544
00:26:49,556 --> 00:26:51,319
trying to balance ourselves, first of all.

545
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,397
Balance the car is very important and

546
00:26:54,597 --> 00:26:57,859
when we have learned how to use these two forces,

547
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:00,351
then we think we have become drivers.

548
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:02,842
At that time, we do it automatically.

549
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:04,570
We don’t think about it.

550
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,432
That’s what happens to you that first, when Kundalini rises

551
00:27:08,632 --> 00:27:12,242
above this center, you become thoughtlessly aware.

552
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:14,940
That means there is no thought, but you are

553
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,996
completely aware and alert.

554
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:19,840
And when

555
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:22,734
this rises from here,

556
00:27:23,012 --> 00:27:27,012
here is the seat of the Spirit though 
the seat resides in human beings in the Heart.

557
00:27:27,363 --> 00:27:30,011
When it touches the seat of the Spirit

558
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:34,156
then the master who’s sitting at the back seat

559
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:36,828
watching you,

560
00:27:37,265 --> 00:27:38,730
you become the master

561
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,414
and you start watching these two forces within you,

562
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:46,463
how it is acting and also the driver

563
00:27:46,663 --> 00:27:48,812
within you and you become the master.

564
00:27:49,012 --> 00:27:51,867
This is the second stage into which you arrive.

565
00:27:52,308 --> 00:27:53,760
Now when we

566
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,644
become thoughtlessly aware what happens is

567
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:59,742
that a thought rises and falls off

568
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:03,378
and another thought rises and falls off

569
00:28:03,746 --> 00:28:07,388
and in the center of the two thoughts

570
00:28:07,701 --> 00:28:09,380
is a little area.

571
00:28:09,842 --> 00:28:12,772
Now these thoughts may arise

572
00:28:12,972 --> 00:28:15,341
from the future or from the past

573
00:28:16,123 --> 00:28:18,928
and the central part is the present.

574
00:28:19,128 --> 00:28:23,080
So when the Kundalini rises
what happens is that you’ve become

575
00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:25,589
stationed in the present

576
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,467
where there is no thought.

577
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:30,065
If I say you stand on the present you cannot be

578
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:32,331
because we are on the future or on the past

579
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:33,757
because there were thoughts.

580
00:28:33,957 --> 00:28:37,332
But when the thoughts are removed you stand

581
00:28:37,754 --> 00:28:40,570
in the center of those two thoughts

582
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,746
and you’ve become

583
00:28:42,946 --> 00:28:45,577
thoughtlessly aware.

584
00:28:45,777 --> 00:28:47,102
and this state

585
00:28:47,302 --> 00:28:49,238
is such a wonderful state

586
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:51,524
that at that time whatever you see

587
00:28:51,724 --> 00:28:53,620
becomes a picture memory,

588
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,185
not only as a memory,

589
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:58,237
but the joy of creation starts pouring into you.

590
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,968
You start understanding the joy of creation

591
00:29:01,168 --> 00:29:03,850
and lots of powers you start manifesting

592
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,277
that at this time you can cure people,

593
00:29:07,738 --> 00:29:09,183
you can heal them

594
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:12,105
– physically, maybe mentally also.

595
00:29:12,355 --> 00:29:14,110
But that’s not enough.

596
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,942
In that also you should not get lost.

597
00:29:17,142 --> 00:29:19,572
Some people do it by some other forces

598
00:29:19,772 --> 00:29:20,959
which are spirits.

599
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,805
What they do is to put some spirits
into a person, take out some spirits,

600
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:26,359
transfer some spirits they do.

601
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,015
This is absolutely a different
area into which we don’t have to go.

602
00:29:30,215 --> 00:29:32,375
We have to do everything

603
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:35,000
which is complete Spirit,

604
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,099
ourselves masters, knowing everything

605
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:39,742
about what you are doing.

606
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:42,500
We are never under the blanket, no darkness.

607
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,452
You see everything, what you are doing, what you are getting,

608
00:29:45,652 --> 00:29:48,079
these powers that are flowing through your hand,

609
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:50,484
you know what exactly they mean.

610
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:52,137
They are all recorded for you,

611
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:55,132
you don’t have to research
it and you can only verify it.

612
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:56,732
Like the gentleman

613
00:29:56,932 --> 00:30:00,012
who got his realization

614
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:03,122
from me and then he said,

615
00:30:03,322 --> 00:30:06,390
“Mother, I can’t believe I can be collectively conscious

616
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,958
because you see the brains here are working a bit too much,

617
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:12,153
The Heart is less, the brain is too much.

618
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:15,406
There’s an imbalance between the Heart and the brain.

619
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,632
So I said, “All right, try with your brain.

620
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:20,828
By asking you can verify.”

621
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,841
He said. “I want to know -

622
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:27,918
“Please find out, how is the”

623
00:30:28,832 --> 00:30:31,496
He said. “I want to find out: How is my father?”

624
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,243
I said, “All right, you just put your hands like this

625
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,450
and try to find out how is your father.”

626
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,743
So he says, “Mother, I’m getting a very

627
00:30:39,943 --> 00:30:43,876
great heat here and it's burning, a very funny feeling here.

628
00:30:44,756 --> 00:30:48,756
So I said, “All right, if that 
is so, these are all the centers

629
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:51,187
that are indicating your father

630
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:53,174
and if it is in this

631
00:30:53,374 --> 00:30:55,108
finger you are feeling,

632
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:58,491
then you must know that he must be down

633
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,300
with very bad bronchitis

634
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,971
because this finger denotes this center here.”

635
00:31:04,347 --> 00:31:06,788
So he telephoned his father in my place

636
00:31:06,988 --> 00:31:09,498
and his mother came to the phone and she said

637
00:31:09,698 --> 00:31:12,635
he is down with very bad bronchitis

638
00:31:12,835 --> 00:31:14,834
– The same sentence she used.

639
00:31:15,034 --> 00:31:17,034
So that’s how you can feel it.

640
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,812
You must know that in the realm of God

641
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:21,835
we are really fantastic.

642
00:31:22,035 --> 00:31:24,026
We have to enter into the realm of God,

643
00:31:24,226 --> 00:31:26,170
we have to become the citizen of God’s realm.

644
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:29,240
Then only be amazed that He has

645
00:31:29,444 --> 00:31:31,435
the greatest capacity,

646
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:34,732
that you cannot imagine how dynamically it is,

647
00:31:34,932 --> 00:31:37,212
how it works. There have been so many

648
00:31:37,412 --> 00:31:39,044
incidents in Sahaja Yoga

649
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:40,959
that people can tell you sometimes

650
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:43,613
how miracles after miracles have taken place

651
00:31:43,813 --> 00:31:46,292
which they cannot explain how it has worked out.

652
00:31:46,492 --> 00:31:49,653
Not miracles like getting a diamond and giving it.

653
00:31:49,853 --> 00:31:53,741
One should understand that those people who go after diamonds

654
00:31:54,022 --> 00:31:55,853
are not the people who are seeking God.

655
00:31:56,053 --> 00:31:58,438
They want diamonds they can get it in the market.

656
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:01,556
Some people who start jumping, they think they have become godly.

657
00:32:01,756 --> 00:32:04,516
How can it be? Are you going to become frogs now?

658
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:08,141
We should understand also
logically what is going to happen to us,

659
00:32:08,341 --> 00:32:11,114
that we are going to be empowered by a power

660
00:32:11,314 --> 00:32:13,352
which we should know how to handle.

661
00:32:13,552 --> 00:32:15,343
Otherwise no use

662
00:32:15,543 --> 00:32:17,785
doing all these tricks these days people are doing.

663
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:19,492
Some peoples are just jumping,

664
00:32:19,692 --> 00:32:22,532
some start shouting, screaming, some becoming dogs,

665
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,445
some becoming like a lion.

666
00:32:24,645 --> 00:32:26,572
You are not to go to your subconscious now

667
00:32:26,772 --> 00:32:28,823
because God has placed so beautifully.

668
00:32:29,023 --> 00:32:32,452
Your subconscious is on
the left hand side and your

669
00:32:32,652 --> 00:32:34,644
right side is your future.

670
00:32:35,027 --> 00:32:37,558
So there is a room kept for you in the center,

671
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:39,249
like you have made a home here,

672
00:32:39,449 --> 00:32:41,359
like there was a room there.

673
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:45,535
But the idea of the psychologists here was so confused

674
00:32:45,754 --> 00:32:48,815
that some of the Indians maybe have taken

675
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:50,366
a little clue from that,

676
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:52,573
and they have come here to take you down

677
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:54,900
to subconscious, which is the easiest thing to do

678
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,959
is to take down to your subconscious.

679
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:58,764
That’s what they have done.

680
00:32:58,964 --> 00:33:00,433
They have mesmerized people,

681
00:33:00,633 --> 00:33:03,245
started these cults and these false gurus have come

682
00:33:03,445 --> 00:33:06,372
and they are just doing nothing
but taking you to your subconscious

683
00:33:06,572 --> 00:33:09,778
where you get caught up and
possessed by the collective subconscious,

684
00:33:09,978 --> 00:33:13,126
and you think you are in the best

685
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,484
position but you don’t know where you are moving.

686
00:33:15,684 --> 00:33:17,184
You have no idea.

687
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:23,799
So the best thing for us is to see

688
00:33:25,334 --> 00:33:28,550
what we get ourselves,

689
00:33:28,754 --> 00:33:30,874
what we know ourselves.

690
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:32,822
Some people have given six thousand,

691
00:33:33,022 --> 00:33:35,513
some people have given fifteen thousand.

692
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,997
But for what are you giving money?

693
00:33:38,505 --> 00:33:40,844
It is something I can’t understand.

694
00:33:41,044 --> 00:33:43,012
I came about ten years back

695
00:33:43,212 --> 00:33:45,160
to your great country, America,

696
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,778
and they couldn’t understand me
when I said you cannot pay money for this

697
00:33:48,978 --> 00:33:50,559
and they threw me out, you see.

698
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:52,094
They wouldn’t take me seriously.

699
00:33:52,294 --> 00:33:54,735
They said, “Oh, what are you talking? It’s nonsense.

700
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:58,120
How can you do some things without money?”

701
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,402
So this is what it is. But I think after ten years

702
00:34:01,602 --> 00:34:04,606
of good lashing from these people they have learned a lesson now.

703
00:34:04,806 --> 00:34:08,082
They’re coming around and now they have been kind to me.

704
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:11,345
So you must understand one has to be humble about it.

705
00:34:11,545 --> 00:34:15,271
It’s only the ego that makes you think that you can purchase God,

706
00:34:15,745 --> 00:34:17,151
that you can organize Him,

707
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:20,116
that you can organize God, organize religion,

708
00:34:20,316 --> 00:34:21,870
organize all that is Divine.

709
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,917
You cannot organize, as I told you,

710
00:34:24,117 --> 00:34:26,670
the changing of one flower into a fruit.

711
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:30,552
Then it is, too much to think that you can organize thought.

712
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:34,030
We must humble down within ourselves and that’s how it works out.

713
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,146
It works out, it has worked in thousands

714
00:34:36,346 --> 00:34:37,750
and should work out everywhere.

715
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,605
I’m sure in Boston also it should work out.

716
00:34:40,805 --> 00:34:44,278
But there are categories and categories of people that I must admit.

717
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:47,164
For example, Steve, I must say, is a special category.

718
00:34:47,364 --> 00:34:49,898
He met me only once in Bristol.

719
00:34:50,098 --> 00:34:52,736
One program he had come, just as all you have come,

720
00:34:52,936 --> 00:34:55,122
then he came to see me next day.

721
00:34:55,522 --> 00:34:58,335
Actually person to person, he met me only once

722
00:34:58,535 --> 00:35:00,196
and then he said he has to go to Boston.

723
00:35:00,396 --> 00:35:02,204
I said, “A very good idea. Go to Boston

724
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:04,433
and I hope I meet you there.”

725
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:06,052
When I came to America

726
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:08,442
two years back he just sent me a telegram.

727
00:35:08,642 --> 00:35:11,643
He said, “Mother, I’m in Boston.
Will you come here we’ll have a program.”

728
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,013
He was occupying a small little room

729
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:15,693
and sweetly

730
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:18,371
he invited me there and I said, “All right, I’m going to Boston.”

731
00:35:18,571 --> 00:35:22,110
People said, “Mother, you don’t know
 him very well.” I said, “I know him very well.

732
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,267
I’m going.”

733
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:27,251
I came here and we had a program in Boston and today

734
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:30,229
because of the quality of people who are running it,

735
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,358
we have a nice proper center

736
00:35:32,558 --> 00:35:36,225
where now many people can get their realization and settle down.

737
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,544
But there are categories of very egoistical people also,

738
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:41,014
of very funny people.

739
00:35:41,214 --> 00:35:44,912
Like some people in the church came 
to hit me with the Bible. You can imagine

740
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:48,274
in the church they came to hit me with the Bible, no other place

741
00:35:48,474 --> 00:35:50,071
and all such people are there.

742
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:53,476
But those people who are of that category

743
00:35:53,676 --> 00:35:57,320
are the best who get their realization in no time and settle down.

744
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,449
Some people have physical problems

745
00:35:59,649 --> 00:36:02,052
and that’s why also they cannot get realization.

746
00:36:02,252 --> 00:36:06,051
But the people who have been to false 
gurus and have bent their heads before them

747
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:07,621
also are very difficult.

748
00:36:07,821 --> 00:36:10,317
They have to be a little
bit patient with them,

749
00:36:10,517 --> 00:36:13,599
first of all, to neutralize the effects of this falsehood

750
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:15,300
and then they get realization.

751
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,977
But some of them – I was amazed the other day in Toronto

752
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,356
– I gave realization to some people

753
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:24,494
who have been to those gurus
and they just threw away everything

754
00:36:24,694 --> 00:36:28,243
because they had reached the right
conclusion that they had not found the Truth

755
00:36:28,443 --> 00:36:31,495
They had not found the Truth and
they had just thrown away everything apart

756
00:36:31,695 --> 00:36:33,400
and they got their realization, too.

757
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,259
So we have people and people. We have people

758
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,876
who come into Sahaja Yoga all soft
and then they become very violent,

759
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:42,870
very hot tempered, they are

760
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:46,741
not so well organized and you find

761
00:36:46,941 --> 00:36:49,541
that their temperament doesn’t look like a realized soul.

762
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,795
But all kinds of people come to Sahaja Yoga

763
00:36:51,995 --> 00:36:53,957
and the negative people will always see

764
00:36:54,157 --> 00:36:57,339
the people who are at the lower end and see them and start

765
00:36:57,566 --> 00:36:59,800
criticizing or, “Look at him. He’s a sahaja yogi.”

766
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,904
A sahaja yogi is a person who has achieved a balance in them,

767
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:08,206
a person who has achieved a mastery over Kundalini,

768
00:37:08,406 --> 00:37:11,281
the one who has all the knowledge how to raise the Kundalini

769
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:12,879
and how to give realization.

770
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,393
A sahaja yogi is not every Tom, Dick and Harry.

771
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:16,917
This one, one should understand,

772
00:37:17,117 --> 00:37:20,632
but everybody comes to Sahaja 
Yoga. Everybody is allowed to come.

773
00:37:20,832 --> 00:37:23,596
We have all kinds of people, all types of people.

774
00:37:23,796 --> 00:37:26,553
But the sahaja yogis are a special category

775
00:37:26,753 --> 00:37:28,118
who mature

776
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:31,734
like a seed which is just sprouted, has to be looked after

777
00:37:31,934 --> 00:37:34,621
very tenderly, carefully, respectfully

778
00:37:34,821 --> 00:37:36,675
and then it grows into a big tree

779
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:39,818
and when it becomes the tree nobody has to be told,

780
00:37:40,018 --> 00:37:42,730
you don’t have to tell them by oath that this is a tree.

781
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,898
Everyone knows this is a tree.

782
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:46,914
So this is how it works out:

783
00:37:47,114 --> 00:37:50,332
Those people who are positive about it get it

784
00:37:50,532 --> 00:37:52,110
into their heads, first of all,

785
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,688
and then into their Hearts.

786
00:37:53,888 --> 00:37:56,190
I’m sure it will work out even here

787
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,872
and there are so many people here

788
00:37:58,072 --> 00:37:59,620
it should work out with all of you.

789
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,449
I didn’t know that the program is only for two days. In any case,

790
00:38:03,773 --> 00:38:06,652
two days I’ll be here, that is today and tomorrow.

791
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,761
In the short time whatever is possible I’ve tried to cover.

792
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:12,740
But it's, The knowledge is like an ocean.

793
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,492
But you become the knowledge itself

794
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,523
which I’ll tell you how you’ll become the knowledge

795
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:20,389
and you don’t have to listen to
too many lectures to understand me.

796
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:22,295
But as far as I am concerned

797
00:38:22,495 --> 00:38:25,998
I’ve been lecturing and lecturing for the last ten years

798
00:38:26,198 --> 00:38:29,692
and in London if you see there are thousands of lectures of mine

799
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:32,087
which you can see for yourself.

800
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,713
This happens much better in a place

801
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:38,120
where people are not so complicated. Thousands of

802
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,271
them can get realization. People who are here have seen

803
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:45,068
thousands of Indian villagers get their realization.

804
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:48,330
But maybe people are much more

805
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,600
oppressed by the

806
00:38:51,189 --> 00:38:53,288
modern society, modern ideas.

807
00:38:53,488 --> 00:38:56,538
Maybe that they take a little time to grow, but doesn’t matter.

808
00:38:56,738 --> 00:38:59,695
You are people of great adventure

809
00:38:59,895 --> 00:39:01,664
and people of great qualities.

810
00:39:01,864 --> 00:39:03,302
You are saintly people,

811
00:39:03,502 --> 00:39:06,486
you are men of God who are born in these countries, all over.

812
00:39:06,686 --> 00:39:09,825
Even in England I saw so many people who are men of God

813
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:11,548
and as William Blake has said,

814
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:14,893
that Men of God will become prophets,

815
00:39:15,093 --> 00:39:17,680
and they will have powers
to make others prophets.”

816
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,360
That’s what you have to have.

817
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,965
So many of you are saints, that’s why you are born

818
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:24,203
in such a nice country like America.

819
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,134
It’s such a highly blessed country.

820
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:28,573
Is such a great, beautiful country

821
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:32,593
and then you have to make the best out of it.

822
00:39:32,835 --> 00:39:34,335
May God bless you.

823
00:39:38,659 --> 00:39:41,459
If you have any questions, you can ask me.

824
00:39:57,975 --> 00:39:59,975
Was that audible?

825
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,925
Seeker: I would like to know God

826
00:40:08,353 --> 00:40:11,708
and I do pray to Him

827
00:40:13,576 --> 00:40:16,712
and what you said right there that this is the Christ center here.

828
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:21,239
How long would it take for me to know?

829
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,925
Shri Mataji: Split of a second.

830
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:42,815
Split of a second. And

831
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:47,324
it will happen in a split of a second, no doubt.

832
00:40:47,524 --> 00:40:49,503
But nothing is guaranteed.

833
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,972
You cannot say if all the seeds

834
00:40:52,172 --> 00:40:54,140
will sprout at the same time,

835
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,156
but it is guaranteed that it will

836
00:40:57,356 --> 00:40:59,588
ultimately, alright.

837
00:40:59,788 --> 00:41:01,393
There is no time for God.

838
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,273
God does not know time.

839
00:41:12,565 --> 00:41:14,165
Warren: Any other questions?

840
00:41:18,157 --> 00:41:19,493
Shri Mataji: Please stand up.

841
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:22,548
Seeker: Say you become enlighten

842
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:27,028
and you see things

843
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:33,361
together consciousness and

844
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:36,972
what happens to you after

845
00:41:37,172 --> 00:41:40,588
you physically die? What after that?

846
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,959
Shri Mataji: Yo see that, you should not be futuristic.

847
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:57,284
Why do you want to think of death, I'm talking of life?

848
00:41:57,484 --> 00:41:59,446
I’ve given a big lecture on that.

849
00:41:59,646 --> 00:42:01,372
You can take a tape and hear about it,

850
00:42:01,572 --> 00:42:04,260
but just now we’re talking about life, not about death, all right.

851
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,732
You are a realized soul.

852
00:42:05,932 --> 00:42:10,092
If you want, you can take your birth again, 
do what you like. You are a free bird after your death.

853
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:12,041
There’s nothing like death after that,

854
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:13,907
because you entered into a realm

855
00:42:14,107 --> 00:42:16,384
where there is no death. You know you are dying

856
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:20,311
and changing this body and you can take the body again.

857
00:42:20,545 --> 00:42:23,530
It’s a very different awareness, all right.

858
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:32,070
Seeker: Do you need faith in order to know God?

859
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,224
Shri Mataji: No, not at all.

860
00:42:36,424 --> 00:42:38,759
You see faith, if it means blind faith,

861
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:41,007
on the contrary, it’s very dangerous.

862
00:42:41,207 --> 00:42:43,181
Those people who have blind faith

863
00:42:43,381 --> 00:42:45,256
are very dangerous people because

864
00:42:45,456 --> 00:42:47,764
they are really bound to a certain mental

865
00:42:47,964 --> 00:42:49,416
aspect of it, you see.

866
00:42:49,616 --> 00:42:52,963
And they are bound to some sort of a mental conception,

867
00:42:53,163 --> 00:42:56,192
that this is God, this is God, this is God, is wrong.

868
00:42:56,392 --> 00:42:57,959
But you must have an open mind.

869
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,299
Even if you deny,

870
00:42:59,499 --> 00:43:02,039
then it’s not proper because you keep your mind open.

871
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:03,836
It is like sunshine.

872
00:43:04,036 --> 00:43:05,612
If you are facing the sunshine

873
00:43:05,812 --> 00:43:07,440
you will be affected by sunshine,

874
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,465
but if you hide yourself from sunshine,

875
00:43:09,665 --> 00:43:12,046
the sunshine is not going to run after.

876
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:18,207
Seeker: Who taught you your technique,

877
00:43:18,407 --> 00:43:21,783
you said that you need a light to light another light?

878
00:43:29,284 --> 00:43:30,784
Shri Mataji: Nobody.

879
00:43:31,244 --> 00:43:34,412
You better know me when you are enlightened.

880
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,320
You see the thing is, I don’t want to talk about myself.

881
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,580
The trouble is,

882
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:42,170
Christ just said that He was the Son of God, all right

883
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,885
and they crucified Him.

884
00:43:44,085 --> 00:43:45,844
That’s a fact. He was.

885
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,874
But they crucified him

886
00:43:48,074 --> 00:43:50,941
and I don’t want to talk about
myself till you have your enlightenment.

887
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:52,892
When you have your enlightenment,

888
00:43:53,092 --> 00:43:54,812
then you will know about me, all right.

889
00:43:55,012 --> 00:43:58,108
You better have your light first, and then you’ll know me.

890
00:43:58,372 --> 00:44:00,105
Otherwise, it’s difficult.

891
00:44:00,961 --> 00:44:03,473
I’m tactful in this lifetime.

892
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:08,098
I don’t want to get crucified.

893
00:44:12,497 --> 00:44:14,739
Seeker: If you’ve had an operation on your lower back

894
00:44:14,939 --> 00:44:16,508
where the Kundalini is down there

895
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:19,474
and there is pain all the time can you still have enlightenment?

896
00:44:19,674 --> 00:44:23,201
Shri Mataji: Yes, you can. We can 
work it out, first we'll have to adjust the back.

897
00:44:23,401 --> 00:44:25,553
We’ll have to put it right.

898
00:44:25,753 --> 00:44:28,295
So many people have got it even with their

899
00:44:28,495 --> 00:44:30,649
back broken. Realization.

900
00:44:30,849 --> 00:44:34,167
First, their back is put right and they feel all right

901
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:37,566
and then they get the Kundalini rising. It’s not difficult.

902
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,710
It’s a repairing system, it repairs you.

903
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:44,807
But if something is dead in you, supposing you put some

904
00:44:45,007 --> 00:44:48,408
steel sticks into your legs, we can’t remove it, you see.

905
00:44:49,615 --> 00:44:53,243
If it is a dead stuff inside, we cannot help you, but if it is a living

906
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:55,143
machinery, it repairs.

907
00:44:55,343 --> 00:44:58,943
It just gets repaired. It has to be a living thing inside.

908
00:45:03,907 --> 00:45:05,696
Seeker: When the Kundalini rises up,

909
00:45:05,896 --> 00:45:08,932
does it always maintain a position

910
00:45:09,132 --> 00:45:11,032
or does it ever go back down?

911
00:45:15,768 --> 00:45:18,176
Shri Mataji: That’s true, it goes down also, in many people.

912
00:45:18,376 --> 00:45:21,166
It goes down, it comes up and goes down.

913
00:45:21,366 --> 00:45:25,743
You see, in some people it does.
 I mean, I would say that it, very much there.

914
00:45:25,943 --> 00:45:28,046
But with many people it goes down.

915
00:45:28,246 --> 00:45:29,968
And the reason why it goes down

916
00:45:30,168 --> 00:45:32,455
is because it comes in a flood, you see.

917
00:45:32,655 --> 00:45:36,078
Because it faces me, knows me. It comes up like a flood

918
00:45:36,278 --> 00:45:38,120
and then it goes down because

919
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,761
you need nourishment in different centers.
Supposing you have a problem somewhere.

920
00:45:41,961 --> 00:45:43,132
It goes and nourishes you.

921
00:45:43,332 --> 00:45:46,052
Then again it nourishes. Very sweetly comes up again.

922
00:45:46,252 --> 00:45:47,379
But if you know,

923
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:50,139
once you have touched this and it has come out of it

924
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:53,433
and if you know how to raise it again and again, you can bring it up.

925
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:56,100
That’s what you have to learn after realization

926
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,368
and that is called as shuddha vidya. Means the true knowledge

927
00:45:59,568 --> 00:46:00,975
of divine activity.

928
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:04,136
Once you know that how to
it’s very simple. You have to use only your hands.

929
00:46:04,336 --> 00:46:05,538
Like this you have to move it

930
00:46:05,738 --> 00:46:08,333
and bring it up. You have to give yourself a balance a little bit

931
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:10,196
only because it’s flowing through your hands,

932
00:46:10,396 --> 00:46:12,468
that’s all and you can manage.

933
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:16,132
It’s not difficult. You can establish it.

934
00:46:16,332 --> 00:46:18,092
A little bit in the beginning, about a month,

935
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:20,026
you’ll have to work it out,

936
00:46:20,226 --> 00:46:22,283
but not all. I’m saying just

937
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:25,868
a few people really get it, like you can say,

938
00:46:27,022 --> 00:46:30,122
Steve was like that. He got it, he got it.

939
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:35,428
Seeker: Is all of this really happening?

940
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:39,241
Is this real?

941
00:46:42,006 --> 00:46:43,506
Shri Mataji: Yeah.

942
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:50,982
It is too fantastic to believe.

943
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,697
It is happening. It has to happen sometime.

944
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:57,513
God who has created this creation,

945
00:46:57,713 --> 00:46:59,258
He is worried

946
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:02,533
and He has to look after his creation, isn’t it ?

947
00:47:04,643 --> 00:47:06,959
He’s anxious. It has to happen.

948
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:09,874
After all, we are not responsible for this creation.

949
00:47:10,074 --> 00:47:13,868
He has created it, so He has to jolly well look after it.

950
00:47:15,135 --> 00:47:16,635
It’s happening.

951
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:18,828
You can’t believe it, isn’t it?

952
00:47:19,181 --> 00:47:20,814
It will work out.

953
00:47:21,014 --> 00:47:23,209
Have faith in yourself, that’s all.

954
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:25,960
You must have faith in yourself and nothing else.

955
00:47:30,508 --> 00:47:32,956
Seeker: While doing Sahaja Yoga techniques,

956
00:47:33,156 --> 00:47:34,612
which I have been taught.

957
00:47:34,812 --> 00:47:36,328
Is it okay to -

958
00:47:38,723 --> 00:47:40,996
be like a worshipper of Jesus Christ also

959
00:47:41,196 --> 00:47:43,715
will that interfere in anyway. And also wanna

960
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:47,175
how about like in I'm a musician

961
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:49,929
and the practice of my music, can that be like Bhakti Yoga,

962
00:47:50,129 --> 00:47:53,055
will that, I mean can I use that as a meditation?

963
00:47:53,255 --> 00:47:54,558
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course

964
00:47:54,758 --> 00:47:57,092
but you become discreet you see after that.

965
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:59,965
You start understanding the music which is good for your spirit,

966
00:48:00,165 --> 00:48:01,885
which is not good for you, your spirit.

967
00:48:02,085 --> 00:48:05,120
And you become dynamic, dynamic. I mean,

968
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:07,868
you know about Indian music, something?

969
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,030
Indian music.

970
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:13,339
So many Indian Musicians have got realization

971
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:17,015
and after realization they have become absolutely tremendous.

972
00:48:17,906 --> 00:48:21,532
So you become tremendous but you become discreet there.

973
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,532
You start understanding what music will really give joy of the spirit

974
00:48:25,732 --> 00:48:28,341
and you start playing and the joy of the spirit is the main thing

975
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,492
people are seeking that’s eternal music

976
00:48:30,692 --> 00:48:33,717
because all other types of music comes up and goes down

977
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:36,508
but only the one that gives joy

978
00:48:36,712 --> 00:48:38,307
reminds eternally.

979
00:48:38,507 --> 00:48:40,132
All like those, Mozart.

980
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:42,597
Mozart was a realised soul and his music

981
00:48:42,797 --> 00:48:44,412
gives joy to the spirit

982
00:48:44,612 --> 00:48:47,948
because you start feeling the vibrations when you hear him.

983
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:51,892
Like artists also we can say
Michelangelo was a realised soul.

984
00:48:52,092 --> 00:48:55,972
When you see his paintings in the Sistine Chapel, you see.

985
00:48:56,172 --> 00:48:58,372
You have been to Rome.

986
00:48:58,572 --> 00:49:02,472
You start feeling the vibrations from that.

987
00:49:05,926 --> 00:49:08,877
Warren: He asked another half of the question.

988
00:49:09,612 --> 00:49:12,452
Can he remain worshipping the Lord Jesus Christ,

989
00:49:12,652 --> 00:49:14,174
once he gains his realization?

990
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:17,221
Shri Mataji: Of course Lord Jesus Christ plays a very great importance

991
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,569
but you must understand him in a full way,

992
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:23,526
you should not just take it from the 
Bible because the bible cannot contain Christ,

993
00:49:23,726 --> 00:49:26,932
it's only three and half years of his age is there.

994
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:29,092
There are so many books which have described Him

995
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:31,410
and you have to see what he is really,

996
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,652
what importance he has.

997
00:49:33,852 --> 00:49:37,694
I wish people have gone out of 
Bible and seen what great person he is.

998
00:49:37,894 --> 00:49:39,559
Today, you'll be surprised people

999
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:42,318
like Jews, who believe in

1000
00:49:42,518 --> 00:49:46,572
Christ very much, Muslims believe in Christ
very much, much more than Christians can believe

1001
00:49:46,772 --> 00:49:49,479
because they are realised souls and they know whats his position

1002
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:51,283
in realization.

1003
00:49:55,588 --> 00:49:59,182
Seeker: I would like to know more
about the hands, you were speaking of -

1004
00:49:59,445 --> 00:50:01,787
I guess senses on the hands?

1005
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:08,406
Shri Mataji: That is all written down in the book,

1006
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:09,661
you will understand

1007
00:50:09,861 --> 00:50:13,156
that these are five centers,
six and seven centers in the left hand side

1008
00:50:13,356 --> 00:50:15,152
and the same way on the right hand side

1009
00:50:15,352 --> 00:50:17,726
but what they do not answer in the book is there

1010
00:50:17,926 --> 00:50:19,449
and we give the books after

1011
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,454
you have got realization, not before that.

1012
00:50:21,654 --> 00:50:24,880
Because before that if I give the book
again you will go into mental projections.

1013
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,583
You see, so we are treating you in this way,

1014
00:50:27,783 --> 00:50:29,236
that first you get your realization

1015
00:50:29,436 --> 00:50:31,277
then only the first book is given

1016
00:50:31,477 --> 00:50:34,212
because if you give the last book, it's too much for you to bear.

1017
00:50:34,412 --> 00:50:36,419
So first book you have to read and digested it

1018
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:38,692
like that you have to grow really

1019
00:50:38,892 --> 00:50:41,932
in Sahaja Yoga you have to become, there is no other interest.

1020
00:50:42,132 --> 00:50:44,868
That you have to become so we gradually sort of

1021
00:50:45,068 --> 00:50:48,734
make you understand it so that you can digest it.

1022
00:50:53,795 --> 00:50:56,084
Seeker: If you're a person who

1023
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,978
can't say see things but has visions

1024
00:51:00,178 --> 00:51:01,665
when you come under realization,

1025
00:51:01,865 --> 00:51:04,146
will that go away or will it be stronger

1026
00:51:04,346 --> 00:51:06,217
or will it stay or what?

1027
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:17,231
Shri Mataji: Visions are not all right.

1028
00:51:17,431 --> 00:51:18,756
You should not see visions.

1029
00:51:18,956 --> 00:51:20,659
That means you’re not normal.

1030
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:22,380
You’re on the right hand side.

1031
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,985
If you're on the right hand side you start seeing visions.

1032
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:28,420
The other day we had one boy who used to see auras and visions.

1033
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,756
But he told me his head is heavy all the time, he feels very heavy.

1034
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:33,663
And that he doesn’t feel all right

1035
00:51:33,863 --> 00:51:35,218
and we had to remove that

1036
00:51:35,418 --> 00:51:37,332
because you must see the present,

1037
00:51:37,532 --> 00:51:39,262
the reality as it is.

1038
00:51:39,462 --> 00:51:43,462
At the time of Christ, people started seeing visions of Moses.

1039
00:51:44,027 --> 00:51:47,050
But Christ was there living with them every night

1040
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,459
and they were thinking of Moses,

1041
00:51:49,659 --> 00:51:52,383
they had been visions of Moses and Abraham.

1042
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:53,970
What about Christ who was living.

1043
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:55,965
Now today I am here and now you will

1044
00:51:56,165 --> 00:51:57,876
think you are taking visions of Christ.

1045
00:51:58,076 --> 00:52:00,737
What about me? I am here in the present.

1046
00:52:00,937 --> 00:52:03,473
So you have to be in the present, not in the future

1047
00:52:03,673 --> 00:52:05,554
or in the past. But when you see visions

1048
00:52:05,754 --> 00:52:08,040
it could be from the past or from the future.

1049
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,690
Like in India people see visions.

1050
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:11,900
And they have their

1051
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,856
own visions of the Devis and Goddesses and all that.

1052
00:52:15,056 --> 00:52:16,761
And then they deny everything.

1053
00:52:16,961 --> 00:52:18,939
They say that no, how are we to believe in

1054
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,041
Christ or his Mother or anything?

1055
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:22,801
But when they come to the present

1056
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:26,143
they understand that they were all there. They are there

1057
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:27,556
in the present.

1058
00:52:30,304 --> 00:52:32,219
Because you become one side.

1059
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:37,472
Vision is not a normal thing.

1060
00:52:37,672 --> 00:52:40,401
It’s not very good and those people who see visions

1061
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,401
end up into very bad life

1062
00:52:43,601 --> 00:52:45,620
because it’s not normal.

1063
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:48,100
You will know gradually,
how you see visions also,

1064
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:52,218
what happens to you. But after realization, you just come in the center.

1065
00:52:54,768 --> 00:52:56,492
Seeker: In Sahaja Yoga,

1066
00:52:56,692 --> 00:53:00,416
does the Kundalini go beyond the crown chakra?

1067
00:53:05,941 --> 00:53:07,437
Shri Mataji: Of course,

1068
00:53:07,637 --> 00:53:09,500
it can go beyond, much beyond.

1069
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,320
But it depends on you seeing how you are.

1070
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,360
It has to grow. It is for the complete growth of a person.

1071
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,378
There are three centers above that which you have to cross.

1072
00:53:18,578 --> 00:53:20,690
There are some people who have crossed it, no doubt.

1073
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:23,668
But they are some but you see

1074
00:53:24,694 --> 00:53:27,514
they are a very assiduous, I should say.

1075
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,961
Also they are a category I should say,

1076
00:53:32,161 --> 00:53:34,670
there are so many things about them, the quality itself.

1077
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:37,031
You can ascend much more.

1078
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,765
The seventh chakra is just the beginning.

1079
00:53:41,547 --> 00:53:43,242
It's is just the beginning.

1080
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:53,527
Seeker: I have a couple of books, one by Yogananda

1081
00:53:53,727 --> 00:53:55,360
and one by Sri Ramakrishna.

1082
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,386
I would like to know if was they,

1083
00:53:57,586 --> 00:53:59,260
is they false prophets?

1084
00:54:01,189 --> 00:54:03,255
Shri Mataji: I don’t want to talk about personal things.

1085
00:54:03,455 --> 00:54:05,635
see because I don’t want to shock you about things,

1086
00:54:05,835 --> 00:54:08,075
but you yourself will find out, all right.

1087
00:54:08,275 --> 00:54:12,208
You get your enlightenment, yourself 
you can find out what is false, what is real.

1088
00:54:12,408 --> 00:54:15,505
If they’re real, then you’ll start
getting the cool breeze in the hands.

1089
00:54:15,705 --> 00:54:16,965
If they are false,

1090
00:54:17,184 --> 00:54:19,275
then you’ll get even blisters

1091
00:54:20,494 --> 00:54:21,530
in the hand.

1092
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:24,815
So one has to understand what is real and unreal

1093
00:54:25,015 --> 00:54:27,108
by one’s own understanding.

1094
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,054
When you will discover it in no time.

1095
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:34,593
Hatha Yoga is just a wee bit of real Patanjali’s Hatha Yoga,

1096
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:37,152
and it’s absolutely wrong because

1097
00:54:37,352 --> 00:54:38,993
it makes you very one sided.

1098
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,188
You become physically attentive,

1099
00:54:41,388 --> 00:54:45,119
but you are not only a physical 
being, you are a mental being, you are

1100
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:48,800
emotional being, you are also a spiritual being.

1101
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,891
So this is just such a wee bit.

1102
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:53,520
If you see the book of Patanjali’s it’s so great,

1103
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,751
and in that all Sahaja Yoga is written, Sahaja Yoga written.

1104
00:54:56,951 --> 00:55:00,250
Why they have taken only the – just like jogging it is.

1105
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,982
Just another style of jogging.

1106
00:55:05,656 --> 00:55:07,567
So should we have now the realization?

1107
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:10,775
There’s a lady there? Now, that’s the last, eh?

1108
00:55:11,385 --> 00:55:13,946
Seeker: I was wondering after death,

1109
00:55:14,146 --> 00:55:17,732
whats the quickest that soul turns to return to a body?

1110
00:55:17,932 --> 00:55:19,390
How long?

1111
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:22,612
Warren: She answered the question about death by saying,

1112
00:55:22,812 --> 00:55:25,695
“Put the attention to the future - to the present

1113
00:55:25,895 --> 00:55:27,192
not to the future.”

1114
00:55:27,392 --> 00:55:28,918
Shri Mataji: Just now is not important.

1115
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:31,392
I’ll tell you all about it, it's nothing -

1116
00:55:33,392 --> 00:55:34,730
What she say?

1117
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:37,503
Seeker: I'm just wondering about that one?

1118
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:39,909
Warren: Whats the question again?

1119
00:55:43,862 --> 00:55:45,233
Shri Mataji: Please stand up, please stand up.

1120
00:55:45,511 --> 00:55:48,948
Question: After death how quickly does the soul reincarnate?

1121
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:51,260
Shri Mataji: I mean, you know this is a subject

1122
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,158
which has to be dealt for one year over at least, you see.

1123
00:55:54,358 --> 00:55:55,862
And it's of no use to you,

1124
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:58,780
what is the use of asking a question like this.

1125
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:02,329
Warren: She asking on behalf of somebody else.

1126
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:04,148
Shri Mataji: But where is the friend?

1127
00:56:04,411 --> 00:56:05,879
Warren: Is that person dead?

1128
00:56:06,305 --> 00:56:08,666
Yes, that person who is dead already.

1129
00:56:10,195 --> 00:56:13,503
I think you come and see me and I’ll tell you all about it, all right?

1130
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,539
Because just now, we don’t
want to spoil the minds of people,

1131
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:18,476
all right, with the death and all this nonsense.

1132
00:56:18,676 --> 00:56:20,878
Just now, let us be in the present.

1133
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:25,904
Seeker: Can I ask one last question?

1134
00:56:26,104 --> 00:56:28,104
Shri Mataji: Now, ask.

1135
00:56:29,549 --> 00:56:33,212
Seeker: Beyond the crown chakra
is it still the Kundalini that’s at work?

1136
00:56:33,412 --> 00:56:35,276
Or is it another power too?

1137
00:56:42,404 --> 00:56:45,510
Shri Mataji: Well the Kundalini itself 
because she is the primordial mother,

1138
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,291
shes the primordial,

1139
00:56:47,653 --> 00:56:49,012
shes the primordial.

1140
00:56:49,212 --> 00:56:51,024
You see, must understand shes the Adi Shakti,

1141
00:56:51,224 --> 00:56:52,719
shes the primordial mother

1142
00:56:52,919 --> 00:56:54,977
and she works throughout.

1143
00:56:55,177 --> 00:56:57,565
She is the witness to the last (unclear)

1144
00:56:57,936 --> 00:57:01,412
So she works throughout, I mean
there’s nobody else who works it out

1145
00:57:01,612 --> 00:57:04,479
but because your enlighten you do much faster,

1146
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:06,156
your accelerated.

1147
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,012
At that point you are accelerated

1148
00:57:08,212 --> 00:57:10,126
because of your enlightenment.

1149
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:13,068
That acceleration takes place much faster.

1150
00:57:17,145 --> 00:57:19,350
To look at it, looks like Kundalini

1151
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:21,332
but it is complete Aum.

1152
00:57:21,532 --> 00:57:25,508
It is a complete force, the reflection of the

1153
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:31,412
divine love of God which is the Power of God, complete.

1154
00:57:31,612 --> 00:57:34,138
Because God Himself separates from His Power.

1155
00:57:34,338 --> 00:57:35,846
And becomes the spectator

1156
00:57:36,046 --> 00:57:38,764
and the Power of God divides itself into three.

1157
00:57:38,964 --> 00:57:40,854
And becomes the creation

1158
00:57:41,054 --> 00:57:42,892
and the whole thing is the Kundalini,

1159
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:45,443
is the Kundalini is as they call residual

1160
00:57:45,643 --> 00:57:49,096
because she manifests all that but still shes complete.

1161
00:57:49,439 --> 00:57:51,455
Shes complete and then she reflects this,

1162
00:57:51,655 --> 00:57:54,068
so throughout she works it out.

1163
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,722
Of course in you is the reflection

1164
00:57:59,922 --> 00:58:02,028
of that primordial Kundalini.

1165
00:58:09,841 --> 00:58:11,200
It's a form

1166
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,524
of the primordial mother.

1167
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:15,788
she becomes that form.

1168
00:58:18,177 --> 00:58:20,239
Say now I'm your teacher

1169
00:58:20,439 --> 00:58:22,902
but also I am a wife, I'm grandma.

1170
00:58:23,102 --> 00:58:25,908
In the same way she becomes

1171
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:27,862
the Kundalini.

1172
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,172
Tomorrow again we will meet here

1173
01:33:35,372 --> 01:33:37,799
that's the last day I'll be with you,

1174
01:33:37,999 --> 01:33:40,692
please try to telephone to your friends tomorrow

1175
01:33:40,892 --> 01:33:43,716
and get their friends, as many as possible

1176
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:46,437
because I don't know when will I'll come back again.

1177
01:33:46,637 --> 01:33:49,572
So try to get them, they should all get their realization

1178
01:33:49,772 --> 01:33:52,732
and I hope day after tomorrow we might be able

1179
01:33:52,932 --> 01:33:55,895
to at least a

1180
01:33:56,095 --> 01:33:58,428
workshop and show how

1181
01:33:59,053 --> 01:34:01,508
to make you understand

1182
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:06,859
the Sahaja Yoga, how to work it out and everything.

1183
01:34:07,059 --> 01:34:10,317
Hope to again on Friday.

1184
01:34:10,996 --> 01:34:14,172
So tomorrow please start to call your friends,

1185
01:34:14,372 --> 01:34:16,756
it is their right to have to have it, they should be here.

1186
01:34:16,956 --> 01:34:18,892
If they had come, they would have got it

1187
01:34:19,092 --> 01:34:20,398
and then the growth will start.

1188
01:34:20,598 --> 01:34:23,532
Now go home, don't talk to anyone,

1189
01:34:23,732 --> 01:34:26,216
do not argue, this cannot be argued

1190
01:34:26,416 --> 01:34:29,417
some people haven't got it, supposedly they start arguing.

1191
01:34:29,617 --> 01:34:32,320
Do not argue it out, just go home,

1192
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:33,865
have your food and sleep on,

1193
01:34:34,065 --> 01:34:36,303
enjoy, you feel very much better tomorrow.

1194
01:34:36,503 --> 01:34:39,002
I'm back here and I'll be able to explain to you

1195
01:34:39,202 --> 01:34:42,052
some others things about chakras and things.

1196
01:34:42,252 --> 01:34:44,512
And if you have any questions, I'd ask you.

1197
01:34:44,712 --> 01:34:46,212
May God bless you.
