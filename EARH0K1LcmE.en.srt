1
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:34,950
Today 

2
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:13,530
we have decided to have Krishna Puja because
America is the Krishna bhoomi. It's very surprising

3
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,720
that such a great incarnation of Shri Krishna
came even much later than Rama and has sent

4
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:41,490
His special people to live in America. Of
course, there are many who are seeking in

5
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:52,340
this country, no doubt. But there are many
who are also misleading them. That's how you

6
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:59,870
find, despite all our effort, we have not
been able to expand Sahaja Yoga very much.

7
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:17,640
What one has to learn from His life is very,
very important. The first and foremost thing

8
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:27,140
He taught was collectivity. He used to get
hold of small boys and play with them together.

9
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:46,780
Rama didn't do that. He used to get hold of
ladies who were selling milk and also butter,

10
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:05,640
those who used to go to fill their water in
the pitcher. He is the one who collected all

11
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:19,330
such people in the village of Gokul. He played
all kinds of pranks on His friends and His

12
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:38,750
mother and the mother's friends. Behaved just
like a very naughty child, just to show that

13
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,230
He was just like all of us.

14
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:58,230
As you know, He was the incarnation of Shri
Vishnu. First Shri Rama was born, took incarnation

15
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:12,690
as Shri Rama, which was in the Aryan race,
means that time we had an Aryan race which

16
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,880
was sort of superior, superior race than others.
But when He came as Krishna, He took His birth

17
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:39,170
in Yadav dynasty, you can call it. They were
not superior, they were selling milk, having

18
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:56,130
cowherds and doing work not of any religious
style. But they were innocent simple people

19
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:09,680
living in the villages, and they saw the great
miracles of Shri Krishna's childhood. He killed

20
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,490
demons. He killed Pootna. All these people
were sent by His uncle Kamsa to kill him.

21
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:29,490
It was 
to be, because He had to prove that He was
the incarnation of Shri Vishnu and He did

22
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:43,930
it. As a child, how He killed those people
is remarkable. And how He made them out though

23
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:54,160
they were all camouflaged.

24
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:00,060
In these modern times, difficult for people
to believe that there could have been any

25
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:07,060
incarnation like Shri Krishna. But in Sahaja
Yoga, we have method of absolutely establishing

26
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:21,860
the truth that Shri Krishna was there ruling
on the Vishuddhi chakra. From His childhood,

27
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:30,130
you can see He was fond of collectivity. And
He tried to create collectivity of people

28
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,760
who were very simple, uneducated, good hearted
people. And that is His special quality. And

29
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:50,750
all the people of that village knew Him very
well, all cared for Him. And when He had to

30
00:17:53,070 --> 00:18:00,070
go, they felt very sad and all of them came
running and crying for Him. It was a small

31
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:10,910
boy who was going. After all, what is there?
A little boy from the village is going. The

32
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:23,780
whole village had gathered to cry for Him.

33
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:32,310
That is what we all Sahaja Yogis have to know.
As a child also, He was a very collective

34
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:41,470
personality. He actually emits collectiveness.
The collective consciousness that you enjoy

35
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:48,770
is because of His bliss. I find that Americans
are very collective in the sense, they are

36
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:04,500
more bothered about other countries than about
their own. They want to go all the way to

37
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Vietnam, now to Iraq, now to some other place.
Going all over the world, (Shri Mataji laughing)

38
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:19,640
they try to correct. But their own country
they do not see what's wrong. It's so divided.

39
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:32,590
Mainly divided on race, racial discrimination,
is divided by religions and all of these are

40
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:47,830
just concepts which they have accepted and
are fighting among themselves.

41
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,919
Now after all these, there are people who
believe they are born criminals and they should

42
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:11,919
be criminals. And their criminality is going
very far. They are gangsters. Even small children

43
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:25,970
have become gangsters. But the worst part
is that these little boys also, including

44
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:30,500
others, all these criminals are regarded as
big heroes.

45
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:37,500
I 
have seen once, a young boy wearing a shirt
with another young boy's photograph on it.

46
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:55,690
So he told Me. I said, "Who's this?" "You
don't know? Very famous gangster", he said.

47
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:03,120
At the age of thirteen years he is a very
famous gangster and this boy is very proudly

48
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:10,120
putting up that - like a big hero, or you
can call it like a God there. So see the perversion

49
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:24,010
to what limit Shri Krishna's blessings have
been used. That's why this country is very

50
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:35,030
difficult. One after another there has been
attack of negativity.

51
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:45,010
For example, first thing started by Christians,
who said that Jews killed Christ. It's not

52
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:54,450
true, it's not true. He was never killed by
Jews. "Christ was killed by Jews", is a false

53
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:05,210
statement, absolutely. Christ was not killed
by Jews. How can a multitude kill a man? It's

54
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:16,110
the law there. The Romans, or we can call
the Roman law crucified Him. So the Christians

55
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:28,020
started nicely torturing the Jews, because
Christ was killed. I don't know how to explain

56
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:37,140
this. Such absurd idea. Now somebody was killed
so many years back, and now what's the use

57
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:46,370
of killing some grandchildren of those people
or great grandchildren of those people? But

58
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:53,370
they did not, the Jews did not. Still this
concept was there that the Jews killed. And

59
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:05,669
the Christians felt they have a right to torture
the Jews. So when the Jews came here, they

60
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:16,700
were never given a good position, they were
tortured very much and troubled very much.

61
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:23,700
It happened everywhere but very much more
here. So among Jews now came out some devils,

62
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:32,380
like Freud. And he said, "All right. We must
shatter these Christians absolutely. Their

63
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:48,010
moral roots must be finished." So he started
his own psychology to destroy the Christians.

64
00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:01,100
And Christians stupidly accepted it. They
did whatever he said, experimented whatever

65
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,340
he did.

66
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:17,340
When I was once in Switzerland, two girls
came and they were shaking in the program.

67
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:25,820
I couldn't understand. I called them. I said,
"Why are you shaking?" So they said that,

68
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:33,780
"Actually we are very much degree holders
in Freudian (Shri Mataji laughing) knowledge

69
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:46,120
and we have done all experiments of Freud."
"And then why are you shaking?" "Because we

70
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:53,090
have power to shake!" [inaudible] (Laughter)

71
00:24:53,090 --> 00:25:00,090
So they followed this Freud and this vindictiveness
that was there was not seen by anyone, even

72
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:12,370
by Jews. As a result we had people who were
deadly against each other and ruining each

73
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,630
other, destroying each other.

74
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:30,630
Then this Black and White business started.
All kinds of theories people are putting up

75
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:43,280
to show that the Blacks are bad or the Whites
are bad. The difference is only skin deep.

76
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:55,030
If you want you can cut the skin and see for
yourself. Inside body is the same. But it

77
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:04,210
was so. This divisive method started and it's
still going on. I always say, without Blacks,

78
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Americans will be left high and dry. Look
at the talent they have. Not only music. Atlanta,

79
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:32,390
I saw, all the Blacks were winning and Whites
were not anywhere. (Shri Mataji laughing)

80
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:40,610
Very nicely they used to run, very swiftly
at the end of it, you see. And all the Whites

81
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:47,800
were saying, "Ha, ha, ha." They were nicely
enjoying their [BEAUTY / position ?]. (Laughter)

82
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:54,800
You don't have the stamina of the Blacks also.
So in games also, same thing. With all this

83
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:06,179
what is going to happen to America? It's a
country which has to be collective because

84
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:13,179
of Shri Krishna. All of them are immigrants
here. Who is not an immigrant? Whether they

85
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:20,730
came earlier or later doesn't matter. Thank
God, I have told you many a times that Columbus

86
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:26,100
lost his way and came here and not to India.
Otherwise, there would have been no Indians

87
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:33,100
left and no Sahaja Yoga. (Laughter) I think
it was the trick of Hanumana. (Shri Mataji

88
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:43,429
laughing) He misled him and Columbus came
here. Thank God. (Laughter)

89
00:27:47,129 --> 00:27:54,129
Now you are in a country where you have to
be collective. Krishna won't spare you unless

90
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:03,470
and until you are collective or you give up
this nonsense of skin-deep differences. Then

91
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:12,700
religious differences. He had a friend who
was lame by one leg. He had some friends who

92
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:26,200
were very black. He had some friends who were
quite Indian white, I should say. I shouldn't

93
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:33,220
say white like you people, but Indian white.
He had all kinds of colors. And He took His

94
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:42,030
own birth in the Yadav vansh. They were milk
sellers, milkmen who used to sell milk to

95
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:54,220
people. He didn't take His birth in a very
royal family like Shri Rama. Though He was,

96
00:28:55,369 --> 00:29:02,369
because later on He became the king of Dwarika.
But in His style, in His behavior, in His

97
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:18,590
life, nobody could see that He was a royal
personality. He could sleep under a tree.

98
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:31,210
He could eat anything that He could get. All
kinds of sweet, sweet stories you can read

99
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:40,740
in His life, showing how He was enjoying His
collectivity, never showing off. And His collectivity

100
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:53,919
has to be worked out in this country. Unless
and until it is done from your heart, it's

101
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,940
not going to work out.

102
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,080
We had problems like this always with our
collectivity here. For example, a lady, you

103
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:13,080
know, she is a big lady, I think. She started
correcting people. "Why do you put here? This

104
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:22,200
thing is getting dirty. That thing is this
and that." Such a woman should be sometimes

105
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:29,320
sent to some stable to clean it. Then she
will give up these nonsensical ideas that

106
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:36,560
she has. If you are a Sahaja Yogi you cannot
behave like this. And this kind of a behavior

107
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:47,040
can destroy Sahaja Yoga. Have you ever heard
Me saying that, "This is dirty, this is not

108
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:55,060
good, I don't like this?" Did I say, ever?

109
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,290
First of all, we have to understand, if we
have to be collective, we should give up these

110
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:10,290
stupid ideas about ourselves. Some people
get some position, may be some money, maybe,

111
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:24,639
I would say, have a background. If you are
sticking on to it then you are not a Sahaja

112
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:36,030
Yogi. You are saints. You cannot be demanding.
You have to give, and give, and give. Whatever

113
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:47,280
may be your position in life, if that can
overpower you then you are not a Sahaja Yogi

114
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,409
at all.

115
00:31:55,409 --> 00:32:02,409
Shri Krishna, who is the Virat, who is the
great primordial personality, didn't show

116
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:15,520
any such signs of His greatness. But Americans
have a specialty to show that they are something

117
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:28,020
outstandingly great. But Sahaja Yogis, please
don't learn those things. You have to make

118
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:37,700
others unlearn. If that cannot happen, it's
better to leave Sahaja Yoga for ever. Such

119
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,960
people will make everyone miserable and destroy
Sahaja Yoga in America.

120
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:03,350
Even about protocol, you should become timeless.
Absolutely timeless. Now, if you are particular

121
00:33:10,629 --> 00:33:17,629
about time, Shri Krishna will play His tricks
and your timing will be finished. Happened

122
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,609
yesterday. (Laughter & applause)

123
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:32,609
So one has to know that time is your slave
and you don't have to be the slave of time

124
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,710
- if you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise, you
are not. That means you are guided not by

125
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:53,710
the Divine. The Divine works out everything
very well. But for whom? For Sahaja Yogis.

126
00:33:54,810 --> 00:34:01,810
But if you are not Sahaja Yogis, you'll topple
down.

127
00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:10,879
In every way you should find out what things
we have accumulated among ourselves, which

128
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:19,730
is not Shri Krishna's quality. Now, Shri Krishna
used to steal as a child, the butter from

129
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:31,310
the ladies. Why? Why did He steal the butter?
Because they were selling it to the military

130
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:42,810
of Kamsa, His uncle, who was a devil. They
used to go all the way to sell him in Mathura.

131
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:55,929
So He used to steal it, because children needed
it, and giving it to children. He didn't like

132
00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:02,929
this idea - why should it go to these horrible
rakshasas of Mathura?

133
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,440
Just the opposite in is America. All the false
gurus, all the rakshasas come here and they

134
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:25,450
get all the butter. As if people have no brains
to understand, while Shri Krishna is the brain

135
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:45,560
of the Virat. But here you find that people
have no brains. Anybody comes, says something,

136
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:54,350
"Ah, ha, ha, great." Somebody talks big - all
right. They will give away their money. They

137
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,720
will give away their houses. Their children
they'll remove from the school - for something

138
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:06,720
extremely stupid. While He is the brain in
the body of Virata. So this kind of brainlessness

139
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,790
comes and we really start, even Sahaja Yogis
start behaving in a manner that shows they

140
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:20,700
are really brainless.

141
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:27,700
Apart from that, He is Kubera. He is the God
of wealth. That's why there is wealth in this

142
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:46,100
country. But this wealth is all becoming debts,
you see, because of the special brains of

143
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:56,020
Americans. They are so stupid that whatever
is selling in the market, whether they need

144
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:04,820
it or not, they'll buy. Take loan, again take
loan, take loan till they are absolutely indebted.

145
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:14,619
Now here in the country of Kubera you should
be really rich. Rich doesn't mean just to

146
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,210
have bank balance, but means by temperament.

147
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:29,210
Now it's much better but once upon a time,
Americans were the most miserly Sahaja Yogis.

148
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:42,240
They used to send Me candles as present and
I used to hide that. I said, "Baba why do

149
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,400
you send candles, even? Don't send anything,
because everybody is going to see those candles

150
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:57,400
and what are they going to say about it, that
candles have been sent." Now, this I am talking

151
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,980
for introspection.

152
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:10,980
Are we collective? Are we willing to share
everything that we have? Do we look down upon

153
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:24,590
people who come from other countries? Do we
have racialism in us? Thirty five Sahaja Yogis

154
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:33,450
came from Australia, to America as if this
is some Haj. They went back with very bad

155
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:42,650
vibrations. Out of them half were thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga. Imagine Australia is a country

156
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,970
where they used to send all the criminals.

157
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:56,970
So first and foremost, to judge yourself is
to see your vibrations. That you should meditate

158
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:06,690
and judge your vibrations if you are really
collective or not. Because you are not like

159
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:12,970
that, Sahaja Yoga does not spread.

160
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:19,970
I have seen people from Hare Rama Hare Krishna.
Poor things have found nothing. They get up

161
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:33,950
at four o'clock, start their Hare Rama Hare
Krishna bhajan - four o'clock. Then the whole

162
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:41,480
day they wear a very thin dhoti in which they
are shivering. They shave their heads and

163
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:48,480
put a pig's tail here which is bought in the
market. If you see their dedication you'll

164
00:39:53,940 --> 00:40:00,940
be surprised. How they are so much dedicated,
when they haven't found anything whatsoever?

165
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:11,260
What about the nuns? You see them, you will
be amazed. One fellow came from the Catholic

166
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:19,869
Church to us. He was trying to be a priest.
He said, "Mother, Sahaja Yog - you don't do

167
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:29,650
anything." I said, "What do you want to do?"
"No, there we could not eat any meat on Fridays.

168
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:40,190
On Saturdays, we could not drink anything.
Then on Sundays, the whole day we had to fast

169
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:48,570
and pray to God." "Then - what about the rest
of the time?" "The rest of the time, we had

170
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:55,570
to remember Bible by heart and then recite
it. And if we made even one mistake, the Father

171
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,240
would give us a nice beating."

172
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:12,540
That's another problem with Sahaja Yoga because
it is Shri Krishna's play. It's so simple.

173
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:22,640
You don't have to do anything of the kind.
No disciplining, nothing. Left to you, you

174
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:30,830
are your own master. You are your own guru.
But these things which are lingering in your

175
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:41,190
mind, which was just the opposite of Shri
Krishna's life, which you have acquired in

176
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:48,190
this country, are still there, here and there,
here and there left. Some of the people are

177
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:58,010
really still so much busy with themselves.
They look so pale, thin - I tell you, I can't

178
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,380
believe they are Sahaja Yogis.

179
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:14,380
So when we see Shri Krishna's life, the way
He lived. And then He went to help the Pandavas.

180
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:23,380
He told Arjuna that, "I can be your charioteer.
I can drive your chariot. But I will not fight."

181
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:38,349
Arjuna knew that He was all powerful, if He
is there everything will work out. "And all

182
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:47,770
My army, I'll give to Kauravas, to see the
balance." He said, "All right." He didn't

183
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,400
fight to show off, I am this, I am that. Like
here, "Mother, I am the leader. (Laughter)

184
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:08,109
I am the leader." "Can't hear, I can't hear."
(Laughter) "Mother, I am this."

185
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:18,910
You are a Sahaja Yogi. It's a very great name
that you have achieved. The highest position

186
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:31,400
you have achieved. There's nothing more to
be achieved. Like somebody asked Me, "Mother,

187
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,660
the Indians in India never catch. Why do we
go on catching all the time?" I said, "Because

188
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:45,660
Indians in India know they have achieved it
now. Nothing to be achieved. You want to have

189
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:52,190
God's Realization - I don't know what other
Realization." They don't think like that.

190
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:59,190
They say, "We have achieved now. We are in
the sea. It's for us to swim over."

191
00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:10,369
All these things some of you have crossed
over, some of you have absolutely lost them.

192
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,859
But some of you are still there. They are
the most dangerous thing as Christ has said,

193
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:22,859
"Be careful of the murmuring souls." 
I don't know how to stop this little rat-like
people, who are cutting the nest of Sahaja

194
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:39,900
Yoga. I've been reported about many and I
am really shocked. After so many years of

195
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:50,829
My visit how can people talk ill of each other
and can create these problems?

196
00:44:54,819 --> 00:45:01,819
Shri Krishna's friendship is well known, you
know with Sudama how He behaved. All His beautiful

197
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:15,410
manifestations must show in your character.
Then only this country can be saved. I must

198
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:27,700
say it's nowhere, we have Canada, we have
people also I am told from Austria. From all

199
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:40,020
over, from England. But still, we are not
so many people as we should have been. If

200
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:48,980
you just take Austrians, they must be double
of this. If they could do it, why can't we

201
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:59,359
do it? Because we do not introspect and we
do not grow out of our egos. They will say

202
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:08,339
that, "Why didn't Krishna meditate?" (Shri
Mataji laughing) You have to meditate on Shri

203
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:16,180
Krishna. If He meditates what will happen
to you all?

204
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:27,710
On the whole, I was very happy with the other
day's program, somehow. Despite, as usual,

205
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:36,490
in New York, our inability to really do good
advertising, unsystematic everything. Despite

206
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:49,170
that we had so many people and I put the responsibility
on them. Because that's the thing - it is

207
00:46:53,609 --> 00:47:00,609
Shri Krishna's responsibility. And that is
what is your responsibility now. You are responsible

208
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:08,910
for America and Canada, South America. You
all are responsible and you people should

209
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:21,770
be such that people who see you listen to
you, are with you, should know that these

210
00:47:25,819 --> 00:47:32,819
are the Gopa and Gopis of Shri Krishna. Unless
and until that happens, this America is the

211
00:47:36,779 --> 00:47:43,779
most difficult place. Sometimes I feel it's
not Gokul but Mathura.

212
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So it is for you, and otherwise you cannot
enjoy. If you live with your all old clothes,

213
00:47:53,500 --> 00:48:00,500
you can't enjoy. I must say this time there
were so many people and I have asked them

214
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:09,000
to promise, and put a bandhan on them, and
I'm sure they will try to keep My promise.

215
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:18,579
I am sure. But it is you people who disappoint
them. When they see you, they are disappointed.

216
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:30,309
Actually, here is the first time, Vishwa Nirmala
Dharma has been established as a religion.

217
00:48:35,289 --> 00:48:42,289
It is. But the rest of it is zero. So all
this differences and divisiveness has to finish

218
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:59,230
and we should be one in the collective nature
of Shri Krishna.

219
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:09,980
First, meditation is very important. Introspection
is very important. And also, meeting each

220
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:21,960
other, talking to each other, knowing each
other is very important. It has worked all

221
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:34,240
over. It has worked out in India tremendously,
Russia tremendously, Bulgaria tremendously,

222
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:41,240
so why not here? It's no fashion for brainless
people. It is a living process which has to

223
00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:56,109
take place where you must mature. And what
I find that Americans are not matured. But

224
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:06,900
you are now mature. You are now mature people.
And I hope you will all behave like mature

225
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,430
people henceforth.

226
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:13,619
So may God bless you!

227
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:20,619
There are 

228
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:38,730
Shri Krishna's names they have written down
and I would request leaders to come on the

229
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:52,299
stage. Now try to understand every word, every
name of Shri Krishna.

230
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:55,410
[Hindi ?]

231
00:56:45,779 --> 00:56:52,779
Also, you 

232
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:16,339
say 
the name first and then they 

233
01:00:56,349 --> 01:01:03,349
will repeat it. Name and 

234
01:02:18,529 --> 01:02:25,529
the meaning and they will repeat it.

235
01:03:04,299 --> 01:03:11,299
What about the children? They 

236
01:04:03,769 --> 01:04:10,769
can also come.

237
01:05:29,849 --> 01:05:36,849
Firstly let us do little bit of Ganesha Puja.

238
01:10:55,160 --> 01:11:02,160
If 

239
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:34,470
there 

240
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:27,760
are children.

241
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:15,340
[Hindi ?]

242
01:19:55,820 --> 01:20:02,820
Very few children there are.

243
01:28:56,220 --> 01:29:03,220
Just a minute ??? - Ganesha Mantra.
