00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:08,667
Adi Shakti Puja

2
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:38,709
2004, Cabella Ligure, Ä°talya

3
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:07,875
Today's meeting is very special.

4
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,041
It's a very, very special day also,

5
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:19,542
extremely special and very blissful.

6
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:29,542
The reason is, it talks and sings and says

7
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:42,542
about the born Order

8
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:49,125
born Power,

9
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:57,750
the Original, the Adi, the Primordial.

10
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,041
And this one is responsible

11
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:09,959
for creating this great universe.

12
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:19,083
Why this has started and how it works out is...

13
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,667
already you know;

14
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,291
I need not talk about that.

15
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:29,792
But today we have to talk about this Power,

16
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:35,667
which is hidden in your hearts,

17
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:41,667
by which you can do whatever you like to create

18
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:47,667
a new world, a new family,  a new standards,

19
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:51,291
everything that is not known so far.

20
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:58,375
That is quite possible;

21
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:05,458
that is quite possible and is being done,

22
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:09,542
but what is difficult is

23
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:16,417
how to make people more adaptable, more

24
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:26,250
in tune with each other, absolutely.

25
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:32,250
It seems to be a difficult thing.

26
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,959
They're all right among themselves,

27
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:40,083
if they are own friends, their own styles and things.

28
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:47,166
But to make them absolutely one, one with each other

29
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:53,709
in one tune, in one line is very, very difficult

30
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,625
and it should not be done.

31
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:59,375
That's not supposed to be;

32
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:02,458
they're not supposed to be like that,

33
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:07,458
but it has to work out.

34
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,959
Now the problem is,

35
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:18,291
we have beautiful people, beautiful souls,

36
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,959
but they do not become

37
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:25,583
so one with each other as they should have.

38
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,125
Now, how to solve this problem?

39
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,083
Many people have asked Me,

40
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:37,166
"Mother, how to make that problem";

41
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,834
I just smiled.

42
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:43,792
Because, if you see the original idea

43
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:53,375
why we started this x ray

44
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:56,500
why we started this new kind of a

45
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:08,083
understanding, new kind of penetration -

46
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:15,875
because we wanted to find out the oneness, the newness

47
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,417
in every person.

48
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:24,417
Now you should be very much thankful that

49
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:29,208
you are all one, one inside,

50
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,375
there's nothing second.

51
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:37,333
There's only one and that one when it speaks

52
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:43,250
and when it wants to administer something,

53
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,667
then you'll be amazed that it's all done the same way.

54
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:53,792
It's the same thing and it works out the same way.

55
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:59,750
There is no change, there's no difference between the two.

56
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:08,500
Despite that, despite that, our minds are roving,

57
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:11,875
roving into some sort of a problem,

58
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:16,375
which has no significance in Sahaja Yoga.

59
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:23,083
Now the main problem that we have is that

60
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,875
we don't realize that we have no problem.

61
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,625
We are without any problems.

62
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,667
We think that there are problems and

63
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,583
we should deal with problems,

64
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:37,959
but there are none; none of those problems are there.

65
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,291
I don't see any problem anywhere.

66
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,458
Those who think they have problems,

67
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:45,875
I've asked them to write it down,

68
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,959
and I'll try to answer them

69
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,375
and tell them what sort of a problem it is.

70
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:55,166
But before I could do anything, I would like to say

71
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:01,458
that still our Sahaja Yogis are not come to that level

72
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,792
to understand the oneness, the uniqueness

73
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:12,083
in their hearts of their oneness.

74
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:19,375
All this comes from within, not from without,

75
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,417
so all efforts made outside is of no use.

76
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:30,417
We have to be effortless and become what we are.

77
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,166
There you'll find  there is no... nothing.

78
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:41,333
There is no need to have another... another meeting or

79
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:44,959
any other coding something,

80
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,166
no need; it's all there.

81
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,625
Just you have to be that, to become that.

82
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:54,792
This is rather difficult to understand for people

83
00:17:55,083 --> 00:18:00,166
who have different noses, different faces, different everything,

84
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,083
to become the same.

85
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,709
But you are, you are; because

86
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,041
you don't know that you are that's why you are looking different.

87
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:13,959
So, I have to tell you one thing:  that you are all One.

88
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:21,792
One in the sense that your everything,

89
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,583
impulse, every feeling,

90
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:34,583
every understanding is the same.

91
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:40,834
Only thing is that it arises at a wrong time,

92
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:45,667
at different times and it gives you a wrong impression

93
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:50,166
that it is different, but actually it is not.

94
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:54,375
It is only one, one relationship,

95
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:59,709
and the relationship is with the Adi Shakti

96
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:04,959
- that you are a part and parcel of Adi Shakti;

97
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,959
that whatever one may try,

98
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,291
one cannot get separated from Adi Shakti.

99
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,250
You are born out of Her and you are guided by Her,

100
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,125
you are looked after (by) Her.

101
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:25,083
Everything seems to be one to Me

102
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,875
while you people think there is a different

103
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:32,250
line of a course, line of action, which is wrong.

104
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:37,000
Whatever I may say, it has to be proved,

105
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:44,500
otherwise why should you accept such a ghastly statement?

106
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:52,500
Myself, I am one with you

107
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:57,500
and I am always... will remain the same with all of you.

108
00:19:57,709 --> 00:20:03,166
For Me there is no difference. I don't see anything like that.

109
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:07,917
It's outside; it's only your clothes and your style.

110
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:14,542
Inside, maybe, what temperament you have,

111
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,625
depends on your temperament.

112
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,792
If that temperament changes a little bit,

113
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:24,500
you will see the oneness among all of you

114
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:28,834
and the differences will be lost in no time.

115
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:32,500
Today I saw a very dangerous man.

116
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,375
I thought he can kill Me if he wants.

117
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:42,750
He can do whatever he likes. But no, it didn't happen.

118
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,500
Why? Because I never understood him.

119
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:52,625
He was not like that.  He just wanted to show his respect.

120
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:56,500
He didn't want to kill Me or didn't want to do anything wrong.

121
00:20:56,792 --> 00:21:00,542
It's very surprising how you understand each other.

122
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,625
Unless and until you have proper understanding of each other,

123
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:09,500
you cannot achieve anything that is sober [Not clear],

124
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:16,959
that is essential, that is right, that is the truth.

125
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,709
So, the truth started long time back,

126
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:28,667
much before anybody could think of having a truth here.

127
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:36,750
It's all went off with so many things which were not truthful

128
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,834
and then the truth went away.

129
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:43,291
Like, I would say, that the snake...

130
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:49,500
snake was born out of ignorance

131
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,041
that the other snakes started supporting.

132
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:57,834
Snakes after snakes,  they started growing up

133
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,834
and filling the whole universe with dishonesty and with wrong ideas

134
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:09,166
and believing in it and started fighting,

135
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,667
killing each other. But they were all snakes.

136
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:19,041
So how much one should believe in their nonsense?

137
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,500
How much one should follow their nonsense?

138
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:28,000
How much anybody should accept their nonsense?

139
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,834
It's very difficult.

140
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:34,250
But it is acceptable much more than the truth.

141
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:41,917
The truth is not so very easily accepted as the untruth is.

142
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,583
Why?

143
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:47,333
- Because we are standing in untruth.

144
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:50,417
Our own understanding is untruth

145
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:54,291
and we'll have to change our understanding to truth,

146
00:22:54,667 --> 00:23:00,417
which is not difficult because we are truth. We are the truth.

147
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,041
To become the truth, which we are, why should it be difficult?

148
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,792
Should not, but it happens.

149
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,291
So that means there is something wrong

150
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:13,792
somewhere within us, which we should find out.

151
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,208
And the thing that isnwrong with us,

152
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,709
within, is that we cannot face ourselves.

153
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,875
We cannot face ourselves.

154
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:27,083
We face others, not ourselves.

155
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,166
We never see ourselves.

156
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:37,291
We have no idea as to what our own situation is.

157
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:42,333
And for that is only you needed a Mother - to show you.

158
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,709
And that's how the Mother came here

159
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:52,208
on this earth to tell you what's the problem with you, within.

160
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:58,166
This one is to be accepted. This principle has to be practised.

161
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:01,458
And you'll be amazed at yourself

162
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,959
how much you have already a knowledge

163
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,375
about yourself and about all the surroundings.

164
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:13,125
There's nothing so special, nothing so extraordinary,

165
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:17,625
but only thing is you have to be acceptable to yourself.

166
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:25,583
I think people are becoming Sahaja Yogis,

167
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,667
but they are not.

168
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:31,333
They are not Sahaja Yogis but they are trying to become.

169
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:35,417
On the contrary, they should know that they are Sahaja Yogis

170
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,500
and they don't have to become anything.

171
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,750
Then there's no problem.

172
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:43,125
But when you have accepted that there is

173
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:48,333
Sahaja Yoga different, and Sahaja Yogis are different

174
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:49,917
and you are different,

175
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:52,834
then how can you become Sahaja Yogis?

176
00:24:52,834 --> 00:25:00,083
The thing is the ignorance, is the ignorance that we have,

177
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:04,709
that we are behaving like strangers towards each other.

178
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:09,125
Complete ignorance. We have to know that we are all,

179
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:11,417
all the same, very much.

180
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,542
There's no need to have any ignorance of any kind.

181
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:20,333
And when that happens, the problems of the whole world

182
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:23,125
will be solved without any difficulty.

183
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:26,500
Today's Puja is a special one

184
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:30,125
because you are doing the Puja of something

185
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:32,333
that never went into any transformation,

186
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:39,250
which was not changed at all; it was just the same,

187
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:44,417
remained the same, born with the same and is still with the same.

188
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,875
In such a Puja, what do I have to say?

189
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,166
Why anyone has to say?

190
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:54,917
Nothing. Just be one with yourself.

191
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:57,333
That's the point we come to

192
00:25:57,375 --> 00:26:00,333
- that we have to be one with ourselves,

193
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:04,041
and not to get it lost in the words

194
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:10,917
or in the atmosphere or in the other... our movements of brain.

195
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:14,458
Because, this is the time when the brain starts moving;

196
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:19,000
and when it starts moving, it loses its control over himself.

197
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,041
Like a snake - unless and until it is in its own place,

198
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,959
there's no danger;

199
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:31,417
but as he starts moving, there's a danger to him.

200
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:35,291
In the same way, we have to know that our mind is

201
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,959
very very difficult and should not go into wrong direction.

202
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:46,041
For that, we have to do the Primordial Mother's Puja

203
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,625
because we should try to be on the line of Primordial Mother.

204
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:54,166
We have to keep ourselves Primordial.

205
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,709
We have to work out our Primordial Self,

206
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:02,500
and not to change ourselves for any rhyme or reason.

207
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:06,166
This will be the best thing, if we can achieve it.

208
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,542
I'm sure we can, not such a problem.

209
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:16,709
Only thing is that we are so conscious of being Indians,

210
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:21,875
being English,  being English, European and all that.

211
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,083
But we are not.

212
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:28,667
We are just ourselves and that's what we have to achieve

213
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:34,458
- that Oneness with ourselves.
May God bless you all!
