1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:08,840
Today we have decided to have a Hamsa Puja in Germany.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,940
We have never yet

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,720
paid much attention to this center of Hamsa,

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,400
which is, I think, very important for the Western world,

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,880
rather than for the Indian or the Eastern.

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,280
The reason is, at the Hamsa chakra,

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,860
part of the Ida and Pingala

8
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,840
come out and manifest.

9
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,160
Means, the expression

10
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,260
of Ida and Pingala is given through the Hamsa chakra.

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,420
So this Hamsa chakra is the one

12
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,060
that, as if has not gone

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,840
up to the Agya,

14
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,880
but is holding on certain threads

15
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,580
or certain parts of the Ida and Pingala.

16
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,460
And they start flowing through your nose,

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,300
expressing through your eyes, from your mouth

18
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,580
and from your forehead.

19
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,160
So you know that Vishuddhi chakra

20
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,940
has got sixteen petals,

21
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,540
which look after the eyes,

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,540
nose, throat, tongue, teeth.

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,000
But the expression part

24
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,620
comes through the Hamsa chakra, of all
these. So

25
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,020
it's a very, very important thing

26
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:19,740
in a Western mind

27
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,480
to understand Hamsa chakra.

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,680
There's a beautiful couplet about this in Sanskrit:

29
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,240
"Hansa kshveta ha, baka ha kshveta
ha.

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,720
Ko bhedo hansa bakayo ho.

31
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,880
Neera-ksheera vivek e tu.

32
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,340
Hansa ha hansaksh, baka ha baka
ha."

33
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:53,940
Meaning: "The crane and the swan, both are white.

34
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,960
And what makes the difference between the two?

35
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,020
If you mix the water and the milk together,

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,540
the hansa [swan, ed.] will just suck in the milk.

37
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,840
So it can discriminate between the water and the milk.

38
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,840
While the bakha, means the crane, cannot."

39
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,300
The very significant thing for Sahaja yogis to understand.

40
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,660
Discretion is to be understood

41
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,680
very deeply within ourselves.

42
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,060
And how we develop discretion

43
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,900
is very important in Sahaja yoga.

44
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,720
But before we go to that, let us see,

45
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:52,500
how this discretion plays a part, very much,

46
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,580
in the manifestation of our expressions out.

47
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,480
We are the people, in the West, who always try

48
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,060
to express ourselves outside.

49
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,760
It's very important how you look.

50
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,640
It's very important where you look.

51
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,600
What you look, what you see.

52
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,240
It's very important that

53
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,760
your appearance should be good.

54
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,080
Very particular, they spend lots of time in improving

55
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,980
their appearances. This is the minimum.

56
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:49,180
Then they have a method by which we call "the medias".

57
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,060
The country speaks or manifests through the medias.

58
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,680
And the medias have to have a training.

59
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,880
Every country has it's specialty,

60
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,880
one better than the other. And when you see all of them,

61
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,040
you find that they lack discretion completely.

62
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,600
Also in our speech,

63
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,140
in our expression of literature,

64
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,320
expression of poetry,

65
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,520
expression of our relationships with others,

66
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,180
any kind of expression requires discretion,

67
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,720
which is a deep-seated knowledge or wisdom.

68
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,940
If in the West people were not so much outside,

69
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,260
they would have been much better off, I think.

70
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,840
If, supposing, in England,

71
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,960
people don't become punks,

72
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,380
then others will laugh at them. And they'll think

73
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,620
that, "This man has no money to become a punk."

74
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,700
So kind of a fashion that sets in,

75
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,280
in a society of that kind, which has no discretion

76
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,800
and which is very outward.

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,260
Fashions won't work out in countries, where they are

78
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,040
deeply rooted into traditions

79
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,460
and into proper understanding of life.

80
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,680
Of course, the countries which have been very ancient,

81
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,840
have been traditionally trying to improve themselves

82
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,960
with "error and trial" and "error and trial" methods,

83
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,080
have developed much better discretion.

84
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,780
Much better understanding. But the countries which are

85
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,780
not gone through all that ordeal, have not worked out,

86
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,620
have not gone through that discipline, lack in discretion.

87
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,800
And that's why many of the people,

88
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,380
though they are of very deep seeking,

89
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,560
have gone astray.

90
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,820
If they had discretion, they would not have gone astray,

91
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,980
they would not have gone to wrong places, but the discretion

92
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,080
was missing.

93
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,120
So it comes to the discretion, how to use

94
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,620
your Ida nadi and Pingala nadi.

95
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,120
And discretion to understand what is good and what is bad.

96
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,400
Now let us see the Ida nadi.

97
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,340
Ida nadi is very important,

98
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,360
because the discretion in this can only come

99
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,100
through traditional understanding.

100
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,280
Ida Nadi starts from the Ganesha's point, Mooladhara.

101
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,660
So first we miss the biggest support,

102
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,700
the biggest help, the biggest nourishment

103
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,800
of holiness and auspiciousness at Mooladhara,

104
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,740
if we have no discretion.

105
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,720
We always take to thing, which is detrimental to our growth,

106
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,560
and also which may destroy us,

107
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,360
not only us but the whole country.

108
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,480
We like people who are destructive,

109
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,480
when there is no discretion. Discretion means

110
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,780
that you must choose the things which are good for you,

111
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,700
which are benevolent to you, which are good for the collective,

112
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,620
which are good for your ascent.

113
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,400
On the contrary, the people who have no discretion

114
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,940
fall into the traps of wrong type of people, like Freud.

115
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,380
I mean to an Indian, Freud... nobody can believe that

116
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,180
you can go into such a nonsensical idea.

117
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,220
But people accepted Freud

118
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,820
more than they could accept Christ.

119
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,620
Because the discretion was completely missing.

120
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,560
If they had that traditional discretion in them,

121
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,120
they would have been saved. This [type?] traditional discretion

122
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,420
is the thing that comes through Ida nadi.

123
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,160
Now, that's what they people call it, as "conditioning".

124
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,620
And they say that, "Conditioning is very bad. And people

125
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,720
should not take to conditioning. And one should be free

126
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,620
from conditioning." Which is absolutely
a wrong idea.

127
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,960
In that also, there has to be discretion.

128
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,520
What conditioning is good and what is not good

129
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,760
has to be taken.

130
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,000
Now, because there is no discretion about conditioning also,

131
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,280
outright discarding all traditions, all that is

132
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,300
coming to us through our experiences of our forefathers,

133
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,100
everything is discarded. The history is discarded.

134
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,060
And we say, "Oh, no, we are beyond it. We feel free."

135
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,520
Like I was surprised, yesterday in the plane
somebody told me,

136
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,460
"I feel very free when I have no clothes upon myself."

137
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,440
I mean, if the clothes can imprison you,

138
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,580
then what happens to the real prisons, what will they

139
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,700
be for you?

140
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,880
But that sort of a funny idea

141
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,240
comes into the head of people and they think that,

142
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,460
"We can justify all this stupidity that we follow,

143
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,200
because we lack discretion."

144
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,400
Intelligence cannot give you discretion.

145
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,400
It cannot give you discretion as far as

146
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,120
the conditioning is concerned.

147
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,320
For a Sahaja yogi it is important to understand,

148
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,540
how you develop your discretion.

149
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,740
Yesterday only, I gave a very beautiful talk

150
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,140
to the ladies of Paris or, I should say, ladies of France,

151
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,920
regarding the discretion of women.

152
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,640
The discretion of the Ida nadi is intuition.

153
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,760
If you develop that discretion within you

154
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,500
through your meditative powers,

155
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,500
you develop intuition.

156
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,880
And intuition is nothing but is the help of the Ganas,

157
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,440
which are surrounding you.

158
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,840
If you learn to take help from the Ganas,

159
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,660
you can become very intuitive and

160
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:14,040
without much intelligence of yours, you can say the right thing.

161
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,820
The whole of Sahaja yoga, I would say,

162
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,220
fifty percent at least out of that, is based on intuition.

163
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,900
For that, you have to develop a proper sense of Shri Ganesh.

164
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,460
Shri Ganesh in it's right sense you have to understand.

165
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,040
From there it starts, because he is Ganapati. He is the one,

166
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,900
who is the master, is the chief of all the Ganas.

167
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,540
So the Ganas give you the intuition.

168
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,720
For example,

169
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:56,040
say, I have to go somewhere.

170
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,960
And then I..., what I say is

171
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,120
that, "No, I won't be able to go there tomorrow."

172
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,300
And I won't go, somehow. And people think,

173
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,440
"Mother, how do You know?" I know,

174
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,500
because the Ganas are there, and what they say is the truth.

175
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,080
They know all about it.

176
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:23,740
Or anything I say about someone comes true.

177
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,320
So they start asking me, "How is it Mother,

178
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,760
You have come to know about it?" I live
on intuition.

179
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,580
Like I have to catch a plane, I know by intuition what's going

180
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,980
to happen. This part has to develop by worshiping Shri Ganesh.

181
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,400
So imagine, Shri Ganesha also rules

182
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,800
a part of the Hamsa chakra.

183
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,600
So when we say Ham and Sa, these two are

184
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:00,080
actually the bija mantras of the Agya.

185
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,920
But when the Agya touches the Hamsa, it starts here.

186
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,620
That's why at the base, at the root of it, is the Hamsa.

187
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,280
And here the Ham, Ham means
"I am".

188
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,080
If you are discrete, you will not take to fashions.

189
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,740
You'll not take to stupid ideas. You have your own personality.

190
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,040
You are a Sahaja yogi. You don't listen to people,

191
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,240
who are non-Sahaja yogis.

192
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,320
That is the Ham part:

193
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,080
"I am". Not the ego part.

194
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,780
But the Ham - to understand that, "I'm a Yogi

195
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,000
and I know so many things, which normally people don't know,

196
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,060
and so I have nothing to do with them.

197
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,740
I've not to take any lessons from them.

198
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,820
They are not to teach me anything.

199
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,900
There's nothing that they know, I know much more."

200
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,860
To be aware of your Self is Ham.

201
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,300
So that comes from the right side, I would say.

202
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,200
The discretion of right side is Ham

203
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,160
and the discretion of left side is Sa.

204
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,380
Sa means "You", means:

205
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,480
"You are The One."

206
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,920
In your case you know, who is the "You".

207
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,380
But for every human being "You" is the Divine.

208
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,160
"You are The One." This comes

209
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,640
from the left side - is Sa.

210
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,360
So the word "Hamsa" is made of two types of discretion,

211
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,840
where to see "I am" and where to see "You are".

212
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,720
On these two balances - as they have shown here beautifully -

213
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,700
the Moon and the Sun.

214
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,940
In the center is the cross,

215
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,020
which gives you the balance, which gives you the dharma.

216
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,220
How all these things are connected, one after another,

217
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,340
layers after layers; you can see how

218
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,160
dharma is connected with discretion.

219
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,960
Now there are people who are

220
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,200
suddenly enticed by some sort of a ritual.

221
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,480
For example I've seen some Sahaja yogis,

222
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,980
they come to the Puja and they are giving bandhan to them, like mad.

223
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,760
On the way, they'll go, they'll give bandhan. Anywhere they go,

224
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,160
they'll give bandhan, like mad.

225
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,700
That's just conditioning. That's not discretion,

226
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,700
that's not Sahaja yoga.

227
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,340
It is to be seen - "Is it to be given bandhan or not?"

228
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,700
In the presence of Mother there is bandhan,

229
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,100
what is there to give bandhan to yourself?

230
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,120
The people, when I'm talking, are giving
bandhan,

231
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,840
raising their Kundalini. They're all mad people, I think.

232
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,220
In the same way, there are people;

233
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,360
Yesterday I heard there's one kind of a music record,

234
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,440
is played everywhere in the ashrams,

235
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,340
because they can all jump like on a camel.

236
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,520
It's a music for the camels, you see.

237
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,660
Now, this record everybody appreciates. Why?

238
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,960
Because they can jump like a camel.

239
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,460
Once you start jumping like a camel, human beings can't give up.

240
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,080
They form habits. So they like that particular music.

241
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,220
They'll go on jumping like a camel, because now they have become

242
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,280
camels, they have to behave like camels. Now if there's something,

243
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,540
some music, which is like a horse,

244
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,120
like the trot maybe, maybe gallop, anything.

245
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,280
Now, once they listen to it, suddenly they start following that

246
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,320
rhythm. Now they become the horse, which is galloping.

247
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,240
Now the horse is galloping, they become

248
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,560
horses and they only like that galloping music.

249
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,040
So on and so forth. Could be a donkey, could be anything.

250
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,220
We are not animals, we are human beings and we are.

251
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,480
Hum - "We are".

252
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,860
We are Sahaja yogis, we are not dominated by any

253
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,040
particular type of

254
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:45,800
rhythm or particular type of music.

255
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,200
Every variety we can appreciate and understand,

256
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,840
as long as it is dharmic.

257
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,990
As long as it is balancing.

258
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,460
As long as it is auspicious and holy.

259
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:05,760
So you can see on the Hamsa how many things are judged.

260
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,480
I think, the whole of Sahaja yoga stands

261
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,600
on the balance of Hamsa.

262
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,000
There are people who are very

263
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,280
astute, means very honest.

264
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,980
But this honesty can go into a ridiculous limit.

265
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,580
Or else , there are people,

266
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,180
who are very hard working.

267
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,560
This can also go to the ridiculous limit.

268
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,980
So these qualities, which are supposed to be good,

269
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,160
cannot be righteous.

270
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,960
The righteousness is discretion.

271
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,780
Glorified.

272
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,880
If you have discretion,

273
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:13,000
then you glorify

274
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,220
that discretion into righteousness.

275
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,140
Like, we can say now, Christ. We can take Christ.

276
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,740
Christ was such a discretion.

277
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,480
When Mary Magdalene was stoned,

278
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,800
He had nothing to do with prostitutes, I mean,

279
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,120
it's nothing to do at all, no relationship.

280
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,480
But He could see in discretion that these people had no business

281
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,040
to stone her. He stood up there,

282
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,480
in His own courage, and he said that,

283
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,320
"Those who are not committed any sin can

284
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,260
throw the stone at [My/Me?]."

285
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,380
This is the power of His discretion,

286
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,620
that people just felt that discretion within themselves.

287
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,380
And they felt that, "In discretion

288
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,680
this man is a holy man

289
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,460
and we cannot throw stones at Him".

290
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,600
If you are discrete as Sahaja Yogis,

291
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,940
you will make others discrete also.

292
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,660
Others will have to be discrete and to understand.

293
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,120
And this "Neera-Ksheera Vivek" is the differentiation

294
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,780
between the water [neera, ed.] and the milk [ksheera, ed.].

295
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,240
The bad and the good can come to you if you develop

296
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,400
that discretion part.

297
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,540
In Sahaja yoga, at every stage, you'll find people falter,

298
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,960
also with the right side indiscretion.

299
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,040
And the right side indiscretion comes from the ego

300
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,660
manifestation of people.

301
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,080
This ego is, as I said, is Ham.

302
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,800
This ego doesn't work, when it has to work.

303
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,120
For example, I find some people

304
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,800
went for a marriage in the church.

305
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,860
Of course, that's wrong for Sahaja yogis. We don't believe in any

306
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,900
human religions, you know that. All right,

307
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,640
you went to the church, is all right.

308
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,900
But they sent a lady to London

309
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,440
to buy "Laura Ashley" dresses.

310
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,840
To buy. And I think, also, maybe, some men must be

311
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,220
wearing tailcoats to do the wedding.

312
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,100
Where is that ego lost?

313
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,260
That ego that "you are the Sahaja yogi" was completely lost.

314
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,340
I think, they all went for hairdressing,

315
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,340
all kinds of things they did, and they all wanted to go there

316
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,880
as old Christians,

317
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,480
walking to the church next to the graves

318
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,700
of stupid bishops.

319
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:24,140
It's not only here, India is much worse.

320
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,320
As far as religion is concerned, the left side,

321
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,380
they are very, very conditioned people, and there they

322
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,640
fail to understand, what is discretion.

323
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:38,560
For example, we had Gyanadeva. He was such a great

324
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,060
incarnation and He didn't even have shoes on His Feet!

325
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,960
And these days, they are taking out a big procession of palanquin,

326
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,700
so-called shoes in it - of Shri Gyanadeva -

327
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,580
and thousands and thousands of people singing praise.

328
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,620
Just imagine.

329
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,260
Who can tell them that, "Gyanadeva had no shoes!

330
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,800
What shoes are you carrying in the palanquin?"

331
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,300
And whatever village they go, or whatever city they go,

332
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,260
they are fed with sumptuous food;

333
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,400
everybody falls at their feet, "The saints have come

334
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,080
with a palanquin - " ...and the shoes never belonged

335
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:27,380
to Gyanadeva in it! So this madness goes on.

336
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,560
Now, you see all these things happening around you,

337
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,720
in every country, in every religion, in every

338
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,220
stupid area you see all this happening.

339
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,560
But you just join hands!

340
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,020
You become one with it!

341
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,480
And then it becomes so difficult

342
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,300
to understand, what has happened to you.

343
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,080
Now, this Ego, when used properly,

344
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,540
then it's discretion.

345
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,140
Now also people have another very horrid, horrid conditioning,

346
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,920
apart on the religion - is of the countries:

347
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,460
"I belong to India", "I belong to Germany",

348
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,640
"I belong to England." Everything is wretched.

349
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,940
I mean, to say something like that means

350
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,940
you are not yet grown up to the Sahasrara land.

351
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,520
Those who start becoming

352
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,740
some nationality

353
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,880
do not know that your nationality is transformed.

354
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,580
Actually don't need any passports.

355
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,300
In the area where the Divine reigns,

356
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,020
no passport is needed. It's written large on your faces.

357
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,680
But still inside this deep conditioning is there

358
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,880
that, "I belong to this country, my country is
very great,

359
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,940
your country is not good."

360
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,260
But when it comes to discretion is to think

361
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,260
that, "All right, I was born in Germany

362
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,300
and Germany has made lots of mistakes.

363
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,300
Let me work it out, so that I get back all my German people

364
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,600
into the area where resides peace, joy and happiness."

365
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,740
There is, this conditioning is used in discretion.

366
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,840
In everything you will find there are two sides.

367
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,400
Which way you move is your discretion.

368
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:57,680
For example, there are people who have a conditioning

369
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,540
of a particular, say, a religion.

370
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,800
Supposing they belong to the Jew religion,

371
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,100
and have come to Sahaja yoga. Or they belong to Christianity

372
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,600
and have come to Sahaja yoga.

373
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,180
So now, what is the discretion?

374
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,480
As soon as another Jew person comes, or a Christian person

375
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,540
comes in, they'll just get into a fraternity of bhoots there.

376
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,260
And they all become great friends. Because "She's Jew, I'm Jew,

377
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,660
my father is Jew, my mother is Jew, my this thing...

378
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,080
Same with Christians, same with other communities,

379
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,020
same with any other nationality.

380
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,240
Now, what is the discretion, when you see?

381
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,780
The best thing, discretion at that point, is to see,

382
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,280
what are the faults of these so-called "human religions",

383
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,560
which are formed after the death of

384
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,060
the promoters, or we can say the incarnations,

385
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,940
or the prophets who started them. This is first discretion.

386
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,780
The second discretion is to read

387
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,760
those scriptures and find out, what is so special

388
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,100
that these incarnations have said. For I would say,

389
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,760
if there is a Muslim, he should go to Koran and see,

390
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,560
what's written in Koran as far as Sahaja yoga is concerned.

391
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,580
If it's a Christian, let him go to the Bible and find out

392
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,860
whatever is written there as far as

393
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,940
Sahaja yoga is concerned, because Sahaja yoga is the Truth.

394
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,640
And what Truth is written has to be found.

395
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,320
If such a thing is developed, then you can go

396
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,800
further, if you are brave enough,

397
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,040
and can be courageous, to go and tell the people

398
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,160
that, "See, what is this nonsense you are following?

399
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,120
It's not written, it's not done.

400
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,380
Whatever is written, this is the essence of the whole thing."

401
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:15,640
That's the third stage, where you have to use your discretion

402
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,640
as far as a particular religion, nationality is concerned.

403
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,020
Now when I am, say, in the

404
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,240
West, I have to discuss the West.

405
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,280
When I am in India, you must hear Me!

406
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,240
You don't understand the language - this is good for you.

407
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,400
You would lose all respect for Indians.

408
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,900
I give them left and right!

409
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,620
And tell them what's wrong with them. But here

410
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,840
it is important that much is wrong

411
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,460
with us in the West.

412
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,220
So the discretion is to see, what's gone wrong with us.

413
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,280
Where are we wrong. Have you got any courage or not.

414
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,360
For example, ladies don't have courage to wear a sari outside.

415
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,280
Why? Sometimes - doesn't matter.

416
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,780
When Indians can wear your dresses, you can wear saris also.

417
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,160
Or a man won't wear Indian dresses outside.

418
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,380
Is a little Hum is needed.

419
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,720
They enjoy it, but they won't wear.

420
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:30,060
They'll wear the same funny holey pants.

421
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,660
They can wear the punky stuff, but they can't wear

422
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:41,000
something that is sensible, is good to wear.

423
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,840
It's something that must give you the

424
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,620
idea that we are different people.

425
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,660
Now, this red mark is very important, because

426
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,600
then you don't catch any bhoots. And has to be worn.

427
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:03,040
In the Bible is written that, "There will be a mark on their heads."

428
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,100
But because there are so many other stupid people like Hare Rama

429
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,440
Hare Krishna - I don't think they wear any marks -

430
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,120
we are frightened of the society how to wear a mark.

431
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:18,240
But supposing they say that, "You go about with a dishevelled hair",

432
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,720
we'll do it. Because that's allowed in the society.

433
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,260
We are the people, we are not to be afraid of any society.

434
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,520
We have to come out of it, and we have to teach them.

435
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,820
Whatever is good we are going to do, whether you like it or not.

436
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,540
That's the sign of a saint. If you have seen any saint,

437
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,140
anywhere, they've gone all out

438
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,500
to say whatever is right and whatever is to be done

439
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,780
and whatever is to be followed. That's the sign of a saint.

440
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,080
Otherwise, if a saint sometimes gets dissolved

441
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,960
in the society, sometimes in Sahaja yoga, sometimes here,

442
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,540
then what's the use of such saints? Tell me any saint,

443
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,680
whom you know, who has not fought the society.

444
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,860
Who has not pointed out the mistakes of the society,

445
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:11,280
in a very loud manner, without any fear.

446
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,240
Have you known any saint like that? For Sahaja yogis

447
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,960
it is very important to have that courage within themselves.

448
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:24,620
If you develop your discretion, then it works out.

449
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,480
On the ego side, what kind of

450
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,740
a discretion you develop and how.

451
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,140
On the right side are all the Devas, all the deities

452
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,120
sitting around you.

453
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:44,280
You have to understand these deities.

454
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,040
You have to know what They are going to do. Supposing, now

455
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,560
you are lost on the way.

456
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,440
So, you should not think like all other people,

457
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,540
"Oh, I'm lost in the way, how will I go there,

458
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,540
what will I do?" After all, you are going for some nonsensical work.

459
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,660
Doesn't matter. You must think,

460
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,920
"Why? Hanumana, He must have brought me here for some purpose,

461
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,520
let's be on the lookout." Accept it.

462
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,280
Accept the situation.

463
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,960
When you accept the situation, you are playing into the hands of the

464
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,440
deities and they are guiding you. Your deities are working it out.

465
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,620
Accept it.

466
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,440
And this acceptance will give you

467
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,200
a wonderful discretion over to your ego.

468
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,620
Whatever goes wrong - "It's all right, we accept it."

469
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:50,360
And above all - the vibrations part,

470
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,000
which you have to see. If you do something,

471
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,160
if vibrations are going down,

472
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,200
then of course, "I am a Sahaja yogi.

473
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,480
To me vibrations and my ascent

474
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,240
is the most important thing."

475
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:12,480
So to develop the discretion on the right hand side,

476
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,460
you have to know your goal, your destination.

477
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,200
You must know on what path you are standing and where

478
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,260
you are brought, where are you today.

479
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,780
You are not like other people.

480
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,140
If that kind of a discretion you develop

481
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,320
within yourself, through pure intelligence.

482
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,500
For that you need pure intelligence.

483
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,060
And pure intelligence in a hamsa [swan, ed.] is that

484
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:46,320
it glides on the water.

485
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,520
It shrugs [off] the water.

486
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,720
It doesn't allow anything to overpower it.

487
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:59,380
It's in the water, beautifully beautifying the lakes,

488
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:04,580
also not allowing the lake to

489
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,980
dissolve them, or to overpower them, or to cover them.

490
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,800
This is the part where they are Ham.

491
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,100
If they want, they can dive down. If they don't want,

492
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,500
they will not. They're gliding on the ocean.

493
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,340
Ocean of the Samsara, of this Bhavasagara.

494
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,440
And they are not going to be drowned into it. That is the

495
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,560
Ham part of it, which you should have, the discretion.

496
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,480
On the one side, you should accept

497
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,440
things, when they come to you.

498
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,440
The best among these was Shri Krishna,

499
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:49,500
I would say, who had real discretion.

500
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,320
But, after all, He was Shri Krishna.

501
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,100
But His methods were so interesting of discretion,

502
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,800
that it's enjoyable to know about

503
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,420
how He destroyed so many rakshasas.

504
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,040
Every time He did not use His Sudarshan chakra,

505
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:16,360
He used his discretion. Like there was a rakshasa,

506
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,500
who was trying to overpower the Pandavas,

507
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,900
who was trying to overpower the people, who were good.

508
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,760
Shri Krishna

509
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,360
said, "Now, what to do with this horrible fellow?"

510
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,860
And this fellow had

511
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,380
boons from Brahmadeva and from Mahadeva and everyone.

512
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,560
So Shri Krishna is the center, after all,

513
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,180
so He wanted to organize

514
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,420
a proper destruction of this horrible rakshasa.

515
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,460
So what he did, that

516
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,700
there was a great right-sided saint

517
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:08,420
meditating, and he had taken a boon

518
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,540
that, "Nobody should disturb me.

519
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,020
At least the one who disturbs me for the first time,

520
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,980
I should have power to destroy, if I look at that person."

521
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:25,300
And this one was meditating in a cave.

522
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,140
Shri Krishna very beautifully ran away

523
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,320
from the battlefield. His name is Ranchordas.

524
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,720
It's little... little bit derogatory [PEOPLE?] to say to somebody

525
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,920
that, "The one, who ran out of the battlefield."

526
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,960
So Shri Krishna ran out of the battlefield.

527
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,260
But there was no other way out to kill this horrible fellow.

528
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,320
And he went, and he was covering Himself with a shawl.

529
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,360
He went into that cave and

530
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,000
covered that saint with His shawl.

531
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,340
After Shri Krishna was running [away from] this horrible

532
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,240
rakshasa to kill him,

533
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,920
Shri Krishna went and hid Himself.

534
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,400
When this rakshasa came near the cave,

535
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:22,480
he saw the shawl covering this saint.

536
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,680
He said, "Oh, so now you are tired and sleeping here,

537
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,800
running away from the field! Get up now!"

538
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,460
As soon as he said this, this saint got up and looked at him.

539
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,020
And he was completely burnt away.

540
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,200
So, if Shri Krishna is the Virata at His Feet;

541
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:56,140
or if Shri Krishna is Vitthala on His head,

542
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:01,580
in between the two resides Hamsa chakra.

543
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,360
The discretion is very beautifully described

544
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,300
in the life of Shri Krishna.

545
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,160
We can call Him that he had a naughty way of

546
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,520
using his discretion.

547
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,520
He has done so many things like that.

548
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,160
But they create a drama. They create His Leela.

549
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,320
Because He was Leela. That's why he could

550
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:39,120
use His discretion to create a drama or a play.

551
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,620
So on one side we have the help of Shri Krishna

552
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,320
to give us the discretion, and on the other side we have Christ.

553
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,480
In between is placed this Hamsa.

554
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,440
So we have two great incarnations within us,

555
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:00,720
who are the embodiment of discretion.

556
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,800
So one side is Shri Krishna,

557
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,080
who is the one,

558
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,920
who looks after the conditioning side of it.

559
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,940
And on the other side is Christ, who starts

560
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,100
looking after the ego side of it.

561
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,900
The One who says on the cross, "Oh, God, forgive them,

562
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,420
because they do not know. Oh, Father, forgive them,

563
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,820
for they do not know, what they are doing." Is the same One,

564
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,980
who takes a hunter in his hand and hits people, starts beating them,

565
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,720
because they are making money in the name of God.

566
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,720
See the discretion. That's Jesus.

567
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,240
Same Shri Krishna, who with his Sudarshan chakra

568
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:52,500
can kill thousands and thousands of rakshasas,

569
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,440
becomes the driver of Arjuna.

570
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:02,400
The contrast of Their behavior

571
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:08,120
is the beautiful saga of Their discretion.

572
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,460
Now, for a Sahaja yogi it is important to understand

573
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,680
that they have to work out their discretion

574
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,820
in a manner that they develop their intuition.

575
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,240
I would say the first thought could be the intuition,

576
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,840
could be the intuition. "Could be that this is intuition."

577
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,200
Try, experiment.

578
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,960
But going to the extremes of everything is wrong in Sahaja yoga,

579
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,740
you have to do everything in moderation.

580
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,880
Like, I told them to see everything through vibrations.

581
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:54,400
So they will put their hands, I don't know, to everything.

582
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,520
"Should I buy this sari or not?"

583
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,920
Even go beyond that: "Should I buy this

584
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,100
face powder or not?"

585
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,740
It's so ridiculous.

586
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,840
Is so bad, that ultimately you find you have become a bhoot

587
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,000
and you are telling everybody that your vibrations are bad.

588
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,460
Because your vibrations are bad.

589
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,940
Your attention is bad. Putting your attention

590
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,340
to nonsensical thing

591
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:37,980
makes your vibrations absolutely disappear.

592
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,560
So, with discretion

593
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,280
you must have common sense.

594
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,980
Practical sense.

595
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,560
I've seen people suddenly talking to anybody

596
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,840
about Sahaja yoga. No, it's not practical.

597
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,360
Sahaja yoga is a precious diamond, you cannot give it

598
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,540
to every person. I've seen people at the airport

599
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,020
raising Kundalini of everyone. No, it's not meant.

600
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,980
They have to come to Sahaja yoga. They have to ask for it,

601
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,740
they have to beg for it, then only they can get their Realization.

602
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:27,240
We don't want quantity, we want quality.

603
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,740
All My lectures, if you see in that, I've been insisting

604
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,600
on the quality of Sahaja yogis

605
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,820
and the quality of the seekers.

606
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,680
But when we start thinking of getting a majority

607
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,000
for a vote for Shri Mataji -

608
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,680
I have to say I'm not standing for any election.

609
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,500
Whether you elect me or not, I'm elected.

610
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:09,620
You don't have to do that. I don't need many people for that.

611
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,720
And when you fail in discretion, you find

612
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,340
some problems develop.

613
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,720
Now, it is for you to find out, what indiscrete things

614
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,220
you have done, where have you gone wrong,

615
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,220
in which way have you done a mistake.

616
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,180
It is for you to find out, then rectify it.

617
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:39,240
Otherwise in Sahaja yoga there should be no problems,

618
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,280
there should be no ordeals,

619
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,620
there should be all joy and joy and joy.

620
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,840
But the discretion should be to find out,

621
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,600
what are your weaknesses,

622
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,940
where have you done wrong, what's gone wrong,

623
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:03,720
where, in what part and how we have failed.

624
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,200
Sometimes people think, "Oh, we did a lot at that time,

625
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,420
now we can't do it." Then you have failed.

626
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,620
Like I heard that people are saying, "Now we have come here,

627
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,680
so we'll not go to Guru Puja." It's wrong.

628
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:22,180
Very wrong. You have to come to Guru Puja, no question.

629
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,980
Guru Puja is the one puja you cannot miss.

630
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,900
Even if you miss Sahasrara is alright, but Guru Puja is

631
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,140
very important.

632
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,220
At any cost you have to come for Guru Puja.

633
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,680
I know I chose a place which is Andorra,

634
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,940
but it's not Himalayas!

635
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,980
Now the Sahaja yoga is so comfortable that we want

636
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,440
that there should be no change of flights.

637
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,840
Directly we'll sit on a hansa (swan, ed.) and we can [DO RIGHT?].

638
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:08,120
You will, you'll see that. But if you

639
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,840
develop a habit of thinking, "Oh, it would be difficult..."

640
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,040
then it will be.

641
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,780
But as Mother has said it, "It is going to be the easiest,

642
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,880
everything is going to work out."

643
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,240
Once you think like that, it will work out.

644
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,720
Everything will work out, but first there shoul'd be

645
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,220
pure desire to do it.

646
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,600
Whenever such ideas come into your head, again,

647
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,820
use your discretion.

648
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,420
We go to Guru Puja for our own health.

649
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,680
Every Guru Puja, if you remember,

650
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,340
you have come up very much higher.

651
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,460
Every Guru Puja has helped you.

652
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,860
Of course you say that, "Maharastra tour, that's very good."

653
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,740
I agree, it is - Maharastra tour helps you a lot.

654
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,420
But that's for thirty days, so intensive.

655
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,500
Guru Puja is only one day.

656
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,280
How many pujas you have in Maharashtra? At least eight to nine,

657
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,780
sometimes even ten. That's why.

658
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:29,600
Naturally it has to be much more effective.

659
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:34,000
But Guru Puja itself is extremely effective.

660
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,240
Indians have been asking Me, "Mother, once, at least once more,

661
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,860
give us the Guru Puja.

662
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,340
We'll do anything to have Guru Puja,

663
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,780
please come." This time they wanted to have Guru Puja. Imagine!

664
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,260
You could not have attended Guru Puja in India.

665
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:56,420
But Andorra, I have a special purpose.

666
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,500
I have a special purpose. So please understand.

667
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,620
I am not a purposeless personality.

668
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,920
Gradually you'll learn how I fulfill the purpose.

669
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,620
Yours, Mine and that of Sahaja yoga.

670
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:24,520
Together. How I work it out beautifully

671
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,260
you will understand, and

672
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,240
I hope one day you also develop all those beautiful

673
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,220
ways and methods of discretion, by which

674
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,560
you just do the right thing and never the wrong thing!

675
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,980
Now, for the treatment of Hamsa chakra, which is

676
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,080
more on the physical side - it's outside, that's why it has to be

677
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,300
much more on the physical side also.

678
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,040
So either we have used the ghee, and all that you know very well,

679
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,460
to put the Hamsa chakra alright.

680
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:08,280
Also, for Hamsa chakra it's important

681
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,740
not to kiss people.

682
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,120
I think kissing must be given up.

683
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,260
Because with kissing you do allow

684
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,280
the germs of another person. In Sahaja yoga it's alright.

685
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,520
But once I say that, that doesn't mean you go all crazy

686
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,640
with the kissing. No, not proper. If in India you go and kiss

687
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:33,380
somebody, he'll just be stunned. He'll not know, what is happening.

688
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,000
The more you start expressing your love by all these gestures,

689
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,220
the less it is inside.

690
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,840
The more you give expression, now for example,

691
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:52,560
there's a method of expressing "thank you."

692
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,260
And you go on saying, "Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you."

693
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,200
It's just a lip-service.

694
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:03,120
But many people in many countries don't say "thank you" at all.

695
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,660
But they are very grateful, inside.

696
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:12,600
The gratefulness inside creates the depth that is necessary.

697
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:17,300
So to do it superficially, anything, too much,

698
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,840
has to be avoided in your discretion.

699
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:30,180
But avoiding extremes,

700
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:36,600
avoiding too much outward expression,

701
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,640
again, can create another indiscretion like the English,

702
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:45,260
they don't speak, they just don't speak.

703
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:49,860
You travel with them every day for twenty-five miles,

704
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,320
sitting together; they will not say who you are.

705
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,720
They'll know each and everything about you,

706
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,140
but they'll just keep quiet.

707
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:02,060
They are not supposed to speak

708
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:06,880
- it's artificial. So the second point

709
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,600
we have to come to - we are not to be artificial.

710
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:15,200
It's alright, if somebody feels like, just out of just spontaneity

711
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:20,120
wants to love me, and hug me, I don't mind.

712
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,260
Because it's not artificial, it just comes. Children are most

713
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,820
spontaneous, they not artificial.

714
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,800
They are not at all artificial. In the same way we have to be

715
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,280
very natural about everything. It's alright,

716
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:39,060
while talking to each other, if the men hit the men a little bit,

717
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,940
doesn't matter. They have not insulted, it's a love,

718
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,940
expression of love, is alright. But should be spontaneous,

719
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,860
should not be artificial. We should not take to artificiality

720
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:53,140
in Sahaja yoga. At all, by any chance.

721
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,940
But wearing clothes is not artificiality.

722
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:01,420
To be decent is not artificiality.

723
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:05,220
To be dignified is not artificiality.

724
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,020
Artificiality is that what you don't feel inside,

725
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,140
is to say out.

726
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,380
That is artificiality and for Sahaja yogi, he feels

727
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,620
he has that bashfulness, he has that shyness,

728
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,580
he has that protocol and he respects his body.

729
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,700
Out of respect of the body he doesn't want to do something

730
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,900
that will insult his body.

731
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,680
And that's how if you understand how far to go

732
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,000
and how far to stop.

733
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,900
Then there is another way

734
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,580
of indiscretion in Sahaja yoga, which I have seen. Is that

735
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,720
people start using Me in many purposes, like that.

736
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,780
Like supposing, now, somebody's writing a poem.

737
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,960
So he'll come to Me, he'll say, "Please correct my poem."

738
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,100
I'll correct one poem, two poems, three poems, ten poems.

739
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:09,520
Then he will lose the capacity to produce poems.

740
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:13,460
You should not use Me

741
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:17,340
for your own purpose in that manner.

742
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,860
But in any case you are using Me.

743
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:24,960
But with the understanding that, "Mother is all the time with me

744
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,440
and is helping me," there's no need

745
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,140
to come forward and jump on My time and to take My time

746
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:35,540
and to bother Me so that I should feel, "O God,

747
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,620
when will I get rid of this?" Or others have a thing, "Mother,

748
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,800
You must come to my house, You must take my child,

749
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,560
You must meet my husband, he might be a drunkard."

750
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:51,820
So taking attention to what you call "yours"

751
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,020
is also indiscretion.

752
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,280
Instead of that, you put your attention to Me.

753
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,820
Instead of taking My attention to you.

754
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,120
It's a very delicate line,

755
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,740
as if we are walking on a sword.

756
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:14,060
It's a very, very delicate line of discretion.

757
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,100
But once you know

758
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,680
as a state within yourself, you are discrete.

759
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:25,420
You cannot be indiscrete even if you want to be.

760
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,480
And that is what is the ascent part. So once

761
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,640
you come out of this chakra

762
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:38,420
and pass through your Agya, you enter into Sahasrara,

763
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,060
where you have to be discrete.

764
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,000
Whatever then comes out from there - blessed,

765
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:50,600
whatever expression comes out, blessed, from the Sahasrara,

766
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:54,780
is all discrete and beautiful.

767
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,660
Some people have a habit of dominating Me also.

768
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,500
Like I'm talking, they'll talk in between.

769
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,460
I am saying something, they will come forward.

770
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:11,360
Then I play tricks. I'm good at playing tricks.

771
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,560
But I'm very discrete, it's alright. My discretion

772
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:20,220
plays the tricks. Because if I am direct, you won't like it.

773
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:24,060
So better be discrete and play tricks.

774
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,740
In everything that we do, discretion expresses itself.

775
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,760
And if you are a solid Sahaja yogi or a Sahaja yogini,

776
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,240
your discretion is evident and

777
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:40,400
everybody sees it and knows it, that it is there.

778
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:45,180
So for all of you it is important to develop your discretion today,

779
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:51,480
and to ask me to reside in your Hamsa chakra,

780
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,400
so that you are all the time stationed

781
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:58,360
in the power of discretion.

782
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:02,160
With discretion we have evolved to human state.

783
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:07,500
And to go further, we have to develop our innate discretion,

784
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,760
which I think is the essence of all the religions,

785
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:15,680
of all the adventures we have had,

786
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,020
of all the lives which we have known,

787
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:22,880
is the discretion around which everything moves.

788
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:26,480
May God bless you.
