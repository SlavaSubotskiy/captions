1
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:38,342
Today we are here to celebrate Sahastrar Day.

2
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:55,686
It was not very difficult for Me to open the

3
00:06:55,966 --> 00:07:06,148
Sahastrar because there were so many seekers
in this world: because, of course, I had studied

4
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:21,964
also, the permutations and combinations from
which you all are, in a way, suffering. Also,

5
00:07:22,135 --> 00:07:34,186
the time had come. I felt [that] horrible
gurus, who are really devils, are trying to

6
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:46,167
capture all the seekers. I thought it's high
time that Sahastrara should be opened out.

7
00:07:56,028 --> 00:08:05,820
It was not like Christ’s crucifixion by
any chance. In those days one had to do lot

8
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:12,845
of tapasya and that’s what He went through.

9
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:28,813
But in these modern times, what you know
is much more important than what you do.

10
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:43,326
It is such a universal awareness now because
of maybe, medias, because of communications,

11
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:53,721
because of travelling, that a human mind knows
a lot. It knows so much sometimes that its

12
00:08:53,746 --> 00:09:06,740
brain cannot even bear it. It is so overloaded
with ideas and also the human mind is all

13
00:09:06,765 --> 00:09:18,531
the time anxious to grasp, absorb and retain
whatever he thinks is knowledge. But he lacks

14
00:09:18,556 --> 00:09:27,020
discretion, so all kind of things are accumulated
in his brain in the modern times. Specially

15
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:42,798
with the advent of all this media like television,
computers. Not a media, but it’s quite a

16
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:51,132
complicated brain again...the man had to know
the technique of all these things very much.

17
00:09:51,157 --> 00:10:02,266
And this technique, if he understood, he could
do many things, many more things than your

18
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:16,941
forefathers could do. Thus, materialism started
taking its own development in the minds of

19
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:29,177
people. So the curse of human beings, at that
time, was materialism: when I felt that Sahastrara

20
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:32,344
must be opened out.

21
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:41,280
Before that, people were just simple, innocent:
they all believed in God, they never doubted,

22
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:53,681
and they didn't even seek the Truth. This
materialism created such a competition among

23
00:10:54,025 --> 00:11:07,802
human beings, such hypocrisy, that people
started finding out that: this is not honest,

24
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:20,337
materialism is not joy-giving, you can't get
peace out of materialism. Just it started

25
00:11:20,362 --> 00:11:26,286
developing into their awareness that this
is not the end of our achievement, this is

26
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:35,018
not what we have to know, this is not what
is going to give us joy and peace.

27
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:43,156
Specially after war, this awareness started
growing very much among young people.

28
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:57,069
This is also because, now, the human awareness
had reached the state of the brain.

29
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:04,673
That's how they started knowing better, absorbing
better and retaining better.

30
00:12:07,638 --> 00:12:14,096
You take a little child of today, he knows much better than
you would have known when you were even 25

31
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:21,096
years of age; because he’s supposed to know
about everything.

32
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:31,510
And thus, there was no movement

33
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:37,912
towards knowing what is the Truth.

34
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:46,468
But, as this awareness grew more and more, lots of

35
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,625
seekers were created on this earth.

36
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:54,855
So many people, who never knew they were seekers,

37
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,775
suddenly became seekers. It's a atmospheric
effect, I should say.

38
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:05,813
 And thus, a new category

39
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:14,038
of people were born, became aware, that they
have to find out the Truth.

40
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:24,971
So, it was all simultaneously, according to
the time,

41
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:29,355
 that Sahastrara was to be opened out.

42
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:36,849
And thus, this happened.

43
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,239
For us sahaja yogis, of course, Sahastrara
 is the biggest event.

44
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:51,813
Or we should say - whatever work all
the incarnations have done, all the seers

45
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:58,135
and saints and prophets have done, this is
the culminating point.

46
00:13:59,127 --> 00:14:01,687
They did it for individuals,

47
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:16,670
but to do for masses, that it should go to
every nook and corner of this world, is the

48
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:28,011
ultimate end of all spiritual growth all over,
in every religion, through every great incarnations

49
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:30,046
and prophets.

50
00:14:30,046 --> 00:14:44,755
What They indicated about future, what They
talked about, what you are to know yourself,

51
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:53,782
that you have to find yourself, that you have
to become a realised-soul, that you should

52
00:14:53,807 --> 00:15:00,015
have atmasakshatkar, that you should be a
wali.

53
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:08,320
All these indications....Even the Buddhists

54
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:15,536
know that Matreya has to come. Ma-treya. “Ma”
is Mother. Three times. Trigunatmika.

55
00:15:15,942 --> 00:15:26,691
Even the Greeks had Athena with 3 powers in Her.
So, all of them have been predicting about

56
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:39,375
this time. And that time came and that’s
how I call it the blossom time and the fruits

57
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,178
that are you people.

58
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:55,380
So it is all so much, we can say, in the cosmic
cycle of different seasons - [that] this beautiful

59
00:15:55,405 --> 00:16:05,131
time has come and, like the wheel of time,
has to turn and go further - [that] Sahaja

60
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:12,580
Yoga started. Of course, in a very small way,
but has now grown so big all over the world.

61
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:29,422
Here now, there’s another thing that has
happened, which is rather remarkable, that

62
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:39,200
so far, people used to meditate alone and
maybe one of them might get realisation, but

63
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:46,417
there was no phenomena of en masse realisation,
nor of en masse meditation in those days.

64
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:51,830
They all used to disappear into some nook
and corner of a quiet place where they would

65
00:16:51,855 --> 00:17:05,272
sit down and meditate. But this en masse realisation,
en masse meditation, en masse understanding

66
00:17:05,297 --> 00:17:16,847
and learning about your being was not even
imagined by Me: that it would go to such a

67
00:17:16,872 --> 00:17:26,659
limit, to such an extent, with leaps and bounds.
This year specially, it has taken a very new

68
00:17:26,684 --> 00:17:35,446
dimension, I think, everywhere and all that
is negative is being exposed

69
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,549
in most of the countries.

70
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:49,802
So this is how, when the Sahastrara opened,
the Kundalini started moving towards this

71
00:17:49,827 --> 00:18:03,211
Divine Power, getting connected with It and
was all the time flowing within you, when

72
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:13,954
the nirvikalpa state came. Now when it is
coming through the Sahastrara, one has to

73
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:31,079
know that the Sahastrara has to be clean,
so that the flow of Divine Power is going,

74
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:44,419
penetrating, without any obstacle, without
getting impure, without getting into any kind

75
00:18:44,444 --> 00:18:46,832
of problems.

76
00:18:49,006 --> 00:18:58,458
So, to get tot hat level, to that state, all the sahaja

77
00:18:58,483 --> 00:19:03,272
yogi, I am happy to know, are trying to work

78
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:13,711
it out, their own individual meditations also,
so that this growth should take place.

79
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:27,590
Thus, you get enlightenment in a full way.
But then one must ask why, for what? What’s

80
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:40,227
the purpose? What’s the aim? The aim is:
your aim is lost. You don’t seek for aims

81
00:19:40,252 --> 00:19:54,294
at all anymore. This pendal was built with
such great ability for which we didn't pay

82
00:19:54,319 --> 00:20:02,880
anything. Everybody was working here day and
night, in the rainy season, and I was quite

83
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:09,146
worried about them. I said, “What's the
matter?” they said, “We are enjoying,

84
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:12,826
Mother. We are enjoying!” “What enjoying?”
“We’re enjoying the rain.” All right.

85
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:18,425
“We are enjoying the cold.” All right.
“Enjoying everything, lifting all these

86
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:24,836
heavy things, everything we are enjoying.”
I was quite surprised at them. Nobody had

87
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:34,424
any complaints, but everybody was just on
the warpath, building this tent for you.

88
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:46,201
So what happens? Once your Sahastrara is clean,
this flow of joy doesn't allow you even to

89
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:53,057
think that you are exerting or you are working.
Normally, if you tell somebody that this is

90
00:20:53,082 --> 00:21:01,851
to be erected [they say] “Aaaaaah!” Some
would faint and some would say, “Ah, this

91
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:07,886
will take at least one year.” Then they'll
start giving excuses. “This pole is no good.

92
00:21:07,886 --> 00:21:14,206
That is no good. It won't stand that. There’s
nothing, there's nothing…” Ultimately,

93
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:19,820
you'll find nothing is done. It will lie like
this for years together. “You better get

94
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:26,276
another person. You better buy another one.”
Everything is postponed all the time and nothing

95
00:21:26,276 --> 00:21:27,766
is done.

96
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:34,981
But here, you don't feel you are doing anything.
When you don't feel you are doing anything,

97
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:40,879
how can you say then, “Why?” Because I'm
not doing anything, in any way, so I don't

98
00:21:40,904 --> 00:21:50,441
ask question “Why?” Do I? And in any case,
I'm not doing anything. That is the state

99
00:21:50,466 --> 00:22:06,471
where you are working in the Divine Plan.
You are doing lot of work, but nobody feels

100
00:22:06,496 --> 00:22:13,981
they are doing anything. They all think, we
are absolutely just enjoying ourselves, doing

101
00:22:14,006 --> 00:22:24,487
nothing. This kind of a state is the blessing
of Sahastrara because only in your brain you

102
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:31,692
think all these things; labour-saving devices.
I mean, you tell anybody, “You go and telephone

103
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:37,890
to this person.” Immediately, if it is a
modern man, he'll say, “He may not be there.

104
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:43,285
God knows. What’s the use? Telephone may
not be all right.” “Baba, you see! Why

105
00:22:43,285 --> 00:22:48,226
don't you see if the telephone is all right
or not?” Before that only he will give this

106
00:22:48,226 --> 00:22:55,226
hundred and one explanations that it may not
be all right, it maybe something may be wrong

107
00:22:55,285 --> 00:23:02,285
and just labour-saving, first. That is one
of the tricks of the brain.

108
00:23:02,826 --> 00:23:08,966
Then this intelligence cheats you all the
time. It gives you rationality for everything.

109
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:15,966
Like a person kills his father and you ask
him, “Why did you kill?” “Why not? He

110
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:19,425
was so old. He was suffering and I wanted
to have all the property,

111
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:21,449
 so I thought better kill him”

112
00:23:24,724 --> 00:23:30,066
Like Queen Victoria became very
old, so her son was to think that “I'll

113
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:35,165
never become a king if this lady goes on like
this!”

114
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:47,775
So, the brain starts giving lots of explanation
and cheating – because rationality. It gives

115
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:56,181
rationality and rationality is nothing but
ego or your conditioning. Your ego tells you,

116
00:23:56,206 --> 00:24:02,785
“No, this is no good,” so you stick on
to that point, “This is not good.” Then

117
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:11,162
another can ask you why it is not good. “I
think it is not good, so I think.” Or, like

118
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:19,030
some say, “I believe,” but why? But in
Sahaja Yoga answer is simple, “Why do you

119
00:24:19,055 --> 00:24:26,025
do it?” - “I enjoy it.” What's the next
answer? “Why are you worried?

120
00:24:26,025 --> 00:24:29,014
 I am enjoying it.”

121
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:38,116
Now the people who also say like that, because
of their conditionings, “Oh, I am enjoying

122
00:24:38,326 --> 00:24:43,626
it.” Somebody will say, “I enjoy my drink.”
Somebody can say, “I enjoy my going to the

123
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:49,716
church.” Sometimes I say going – something
else, you see, like that. They are enjoying

124
00:24:49,716 --> 00:24:55,606
something, which, according to Sahaja Yoga,
we too can never enjoy. But that enjoyment

125
00:24:55,606 --> 00:25:04,931
is not collective. That is not supported by
anyone. For example, somebody says, “I enjoy

126
00:25:04,956 --> 00:25:13,231
drinking.” Nobody has erected any temple
or any statue of a man who drinks. Have you

127
00:25:13,256 --> 00:25:23,890
seen anywhere in the whole world? So, though
he may say that, “I enjoy,” it has no

128
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:35,280
sanction from the society. People can say,
“I enjoy stealing,” people can say, “I

129
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:43,673
enjoy killing,” but it is very arbitrary,
it is very individual and never supported

130
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:51,730
by the society, even by the modern society
and there's always reaction to it.

131
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:59,981
But Sahaja Yoga is not like them, when you
say, “I enjoy,” you say it because you

132
00:26:00,006 --> 00:26:08,500
have no ego and you have no conditionings.
It's a different situation because now the

133
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:16,589
Sahastrara is opened out. So, on one side,
your ego has gone down, another side, your

134
00:26:16,856 --> 00:26:26,071
conditioning is finished. You are no more
conditioned. Like you talk to a Catholic...so

135
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:32,437
I started talking about Christ. Immediately
he said, “Mother, now please.” I said,

136
00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:38,436
“I am talking about Christ, not about Catholicism.
Talking of Christ, why are you frightened

137
00:26:38,436 --> 00:26:43,366
about?” “Mother, we shouldn't become Catholic
again, you know. That's why we are worried

138
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:44,090
about.”

139
00:26:44,115 --> 00:26:51,661
Babaa! Christ never started Catholicism. So
much so, they have developed a kind of a de-conditioning

140
00:26:51,686 --> 00:27:01,406
of their minds, that they start seeing that
whatever these people have done so far was

141
00:27:01,431 --> 00:27:08,841
wrong and that "Whatever I have done so far
was absolutely wrong and I'm not going do

142
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:15,186
it." It's a very common thing. I have seen
the people who have worshipped Christ prefer

143
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:20,275
to worship Ganesha and those who have worshipped
Ganesha prefer to worship Christ. [They are]

144
00:27:20,275 --> 00:27:26,466
just the same, the name is different, but
just the same, but they like it: because [to

145
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:38,364
them] Christ means the priest, the confessions,
rosaries and also cemeteries. So they don't

146
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:53,774
want to have. These conditionings, itself,
start showing their own forms, like devils,

147
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:58,390
and sahaja yogis want to avoid it, or have
nothing to do with them.

148
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:04,886
I remember in the beginning, we had about
six, seven hippies from England and they had

149
00:28:04,886 --> 00:28:11,066
come to Rahuri. We were having a program and
there were five, six real hippies. These were

150
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:17,192
hippies [who] became sahaja yogis, real hippies
came to the program. I was just sitting like

151
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:23,706
this and suddenly they said, “Ooooh nooooo!”
I said, “What has happened?” I started

152
00:28:24,226 --> 00:28:32,488
saying; as if some snake has entered or what
has happened? They were hippies, but with

153
00:28:32,513 --> 00:28:39,393
this de-conditioning of the conditions, they
just couldn't bear those same hippies - that

154
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:53,799
they [once] were - coming inside. Because
you start seeing clearly, very clearly, that

155
00:28:53,824 --> 00:29:03,455
all these conditionings had blinded us completely
and misled us into a wilderness.

156
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:13,379
Of course, about ego, in the West people are
extremely conscious. There was a leader’s

157
00:29:13,404 --> 00:29:18,295
wife. I said, “Why don't you help your husband?”
She said, “Mother, I’m worried about my

158
00:29:18,295 --> 00:29:23,236
ego.” I said, “Why?” “If I start doing
some work, this ego might develop again, so

159
00:29:23,236 --> 00:29:31,796
I'm rather worried.” They are so conscious
of it, that this ego should not come back.

160
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:41,543
One fellow who came to Me and I was talking
to him, then he just ran away. I said, “What

161
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:45,686
happened?” So he said, “No, those people
who go close to Mother always develop very

162
00:29:45,686 --> 00:29:52,686
bad ego. So I don't want to be there close
with Her.” So, is a such … (laughing)...

163
00:29:54,266 --> 00:30:04,640
such a mind that sees madness, that sees insanity,
that sees immaturity, it sees vulgarity, it

164
00:30:04,665 --> 00:30:13,484
sees deceit, hypocrisy, everything so clearly:
and in that state, he gets confused and quite

165
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:19,925
upset, wants to run away from everyone.

166
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:28,852
Then we have some sahaja yogis who have such
problems, who come to Sahaja Yoga with problems.

167
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:34,616
Then, these people see them with these problems
they are still continuing. Now the Sahastrara

168
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:41,346
doesn't want to accept it. “It's terrible.
I was like him. No, no, no more. Me, I don't

169
00:30:41,346 --> 00:30:52,870
want to be like that.” So, they abhor the
person who was just like them; they just can't

170
00:30:52,895 --> 00:31:05,007
bear him, they just can't tolerate. Then I
would say still you have to grow. You have

171
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:16,421
to grow, your Sahastrara has to be cleansed
out at such a speed, at such a level and stage

172
00:31:16,446 --> 00:31:23,379
that, like soap cleanses everything, it should
cleanse everything else, should not be afraid

173
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:32,841
of anything, should not have any worry about
the conditionings of others or ego of others:

174
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:35,836
that is the state now we have to reach.

175
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:49,833
Today is the Sahastrara Day, is the 23rd Sahastrara
Day and I shouldn't expect much, I don't want

176
00:31:49,858 --> 00:31:58,381
to say anything much about it: but I wish
and I hope that all the thousand petals of

177
00:31:58,456 --> 00:32:05,608
your Sahastraras will be so cleansed that
you will never catch from anybody; you will

178
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:17,232
never be frightened of anybody. You will be
masters of all kinds of curatives and also

179
00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:29,551
you will be the one who can give solace, peace
to others; you will be the one who’ll be

180
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:39,271
organising programs outside, you will the
one who will be responsible for Sahaja Yoga.

181
00:32:40,296 --> 00:32:50,358
And when that happens, then we can see that
these thousand petals of the Sahastrara have

182
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:52,017
opened out.

183
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:17,000
These thousand petals are not yet awakened.
They signify the different thousand powers

184
00:33:17,025 --> 00:33:31,925
of the Goddess, minimum of minimum. These
thousand ones you can open out yourself by

185
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:40,171
introspection, by looking at yourself, making
fun of yourself.

186
00:33:40,196 --> 00:33:48,870
“Know Thyself” means know yourself with
all the defects you have and also the potential

187
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:56,614
you have and all the good points you have.
So as far as you are concerned, when you are

188
00:33:56,639 --> 00:34:03,243
looking at yourself you should just see to
the defects that you have. “Why do I behave

189
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:15,629
like this? Why do I assert so much? What's
the problem? Why can't I see myself clearly?”

190
00:34:15,766 --> 00:34:27,653
With that transparency of your Sahastrara,
you can see your heart, you can see your mind,

191
00:34:27,678 --> 00:34:37,994
you can see yourself fully, clearly, what's
wrong with you. This transparency can come

192
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:48,438
only if you have really the pure desire,

193
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:53,403
shuddha iccha, to be of that level.

194
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,641
 Now, there is no competition

195
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:09,721
between A and B. We don't say that, “You
got the first prize for coming out of the

196
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:18,779
Sahastrara” (laughing) or we don't say,
“You have the second prize.” There's nothing

197
00:35:18,804 --> 00:35:29,672
like first, second in Sahaja Yoga, because
we are not running the race. There’s no

198
00:35:29,697 --> 00:35:37,297
competition between us. Whatever we are doing
is for our own satisfaction. Now think of

199
00:35:37,322 --> 00:35:43,226
something. There are five people who are running.
Now they have to think, out of these five

200
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:53,644
people, who goes first. Here it is the other
way round: The five people are meditating;

201
00:35:53,886 --> 00:36:03,491
now everyone individually has to see for himself
if he satisfies himself or not, nobody else

202
00:36:03,516 --> 00:36:09,365
is going to give you a certificate. It is
you who has to give certificate to yourself,

203
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:14,296
honestly. It's a very different position.

204
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:24,977
It is you, your Sahastrara and your attention
and you have to see, within yourself, “How

205
00:36:25,002 --> 00:36:40,125
far have I realised my own powers, my own
compassion, my own personality?” You’ll

206
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:50,961
have to test it yourself. It is you are the
one who decides. When you are the one who

207
00:36:50,986 --> 00:37:01,140
is running, it is you are the one who decides
without running, then what is the question

208
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:12,809
of competition? The whole thing disappears
into nothing.

209
00:37:14,022 --> 00:37:23,942
As I told you the other day, an analogy that,
if you are looking at the mirror, then you

210
00:37:24,474 --> 00:37:33,657
are the one who is observing, your reflection
is the one that is observed and there is the

211
00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:44,361
action of seeing, so you are in 3 dimensions.
But supposing you become the mirror yourself,

212
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:57,899
the whole process is reversed: You see yourself.
You don't have to see because you are seeing

213
00:37:57,924 --> 00:38:06,647
it all the time, it's just spontaneous. In
the same manner, when it comes to Sahastrara,

214
00:38:06,886 --> 00:38:14,672
it is your Sahastrara itself gives you the
full idea as to how you are. The diagnosis

215
00:38:14,697 --> 00:38:22,725
comes from your own Sahastrara. Your own Sahastrara
tells you what centres are catching because

216
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:31,778
all the peethas of these seven centres are
in the Sahastrara. As if the Sahastrara is

217
00:38:31,806 --> 00:38:40,060
now watching yourself and reporting to you,
“See, this is wrong with you. This is wrong

218
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:46,316
with you, this is wrong with you.” So, Sahastrara
being the best well-wisher that you have,

219
00:38:46,316 --> 00:38:52,986
gives you the right information about yourself,
so the best is that you correct yourself.

220
00:38:52,986 --> 00:39:02,465
So then, achieve that perfect state: that
is what you have to do. But once you have

221
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:10,157
achieved the perfect state, you have achieved
your aim, you have no aim left. Like the lights

222
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:16,446
now, till you have to make the lights, you
had to work hard, make the lights, put them

223
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:24,681
right, do everything that is necessary. But
once it is made and the light comes into it,

224
00:39:24,706 --> 00:39:37,593
then the job of the light is to give the light.
So the first function is over.

225
00:39:41,217 --> 00:39:48,217
Now the second function is to give it back.

226
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:55,216
You reach your aim, your destination. For
example, I had to come here. Alright? So I

227
00:39:55,216 --> 00:40:03,671
come all the way from My house, come in the
car, walking and come and sit down here. Now

228
00:40:03,696 --> 00:40:11,540
it’s finished that part, over. Now I don'
t have to walk, otherwise I’ll be all the

229
00:40:11,565 --> 00:40:25,074
time running. So, all this mad race of this
brain stops. For what should it be used now?

230
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:38,711
For enjoying the peace, for enjoying the joy,
for enjoying the collectivity. So, the labour

231
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:47,441
or the hard work or you can also say the planning
of the future finishes off. Only thing now

232
00:40:47,466 --> 00:40:51,476
you have got it, so better enjoy it.

233
00:40:51,476 --> 00:41:03,681
It’s like you are coming from outside, you
are running, you are very hungry, you want

234
00:41:03,706 --> 00:41:13,111
to reach home. Once you reach home, then the
food is served to you. Now what's your aim?

235
00:41:13,136 --> 00:41:19,256
Nothing, but to enjoy the food for which you
were running. But after that also, if you

236
00:41:19,256 --> 00:41:30,141
start running, then one should say it is absolute
stupidity! But the capacity of enjoyment only

237
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:41,720
comes when your Sahastrara is absolutely open.
Otherwise the capacity to enjoy is much less

238
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:50,217
and you become like a person who is running
all the time after something which you never

239
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:58,411
achieve. There are many like that. All their
lives they’re like mad, you know. They are

240
00:41:58,436 --> 00:42:06,580
working morning till evening, everyday, achieving
nothing! Next day again get up, again running!

241
00:42:06,605 --> 00:42:13,605
All their lives running like this till their
foot is in the grave, they are still running.

242
00:42:15,845 --> 00:42:25,050
But after getting to Sahaja Yoga, you stop
all these activities and leave it to your

243
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:36,527
Sahaja Yoga to work, to your Sahastrara to
work it out. And it works out. You don't have

244
00:42:36,552 --> 00:42:41,956
to rush. You don't have to be so competent.
You don't have to write down everything. You

245
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:48,620
don't have to think of planning everything.
Just everything works out and it works out

246
00:42:48,645 --> 00:42:54,696
beautifully. The only thing that one has to
do is to accept whatever is happening for

247
00:42:54,696 --> 00:43:08,249
our good. Even in small, small things. For
today's delay in the puja, is the desire of

248
00:43:08,274 --> 00:43:16,491
some people who wanted to give you some sort
of a … I shouldn't say that, but some secret

249
00:43:16,516 --> 00:43:22,436
show was going to be there and they didn't
want any light. So they were thinking, “What

250
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:26,396
will happen – the puja will be over by about
five, then by six o'clock they’ll eat their

251
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:32,626
food, but the sun would be there till nine
o'clock, then how can we show this?” All

252
00:43:32,626 --> 00:43:37,636
right, so have it in the night.

253
00:43:37,636 --> 00:43:44,636
In every small thing you will see. Some people
were coming from India and they had to bring

254
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:51,936
My two boxes from there and they wouldn't
allow these boxes, they said it is overweight,

255
00:43:52,115 --> 00:43:56,386
overweight. So they didn't know what to do.
They thought that they should send them back

256
00:43:56,386 --> 00:44:04,991
and later on it can go till Guru puja or somewhere.
But they thought that there must be some plan,

257
00:44:05,016 --> 00:44:12,016
must be some drama. The plane was late [by]
19 hours, so they thought there must be some

258
00:44:12,376 --> 00:44:24,481
drama; and then they were put into some sort
of a tourist hotel for that night. Next morning

259
00:44:24,506 --> 00:44:39,147
they met two other Indians from, sahaja yogis,
from Poona, two boys. That settled it! My

260
00:44:39,186 --> 00:44:47,050
luggage, they could put it in their name and
that’s how the luggage came in. But they

261
00:44:47,075 --> 00:44:54,075
never felt bored: 19 hours. “We had nice
time, Mother, together. We were enjoying and

262
00:44:54,345 --> 00:45:00,216
talking,” finished! Nobody feels the time
is passing out. Otherwise, anybody else would

263
00:45:00,216 --> 00:45:11,975
have eaten up all the airport personnel and
would have broken all the telephones. Waiting

264
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,526
for 19hours, “My God, what is this!!”
Would have given it in the newspapers. Everybody

265
00:45:15,745 --> 00:45:22,376
… this is the greatest crime! While these
were enjoying life nicely.

266
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:32,945
So, we have lost now the sense of aim. We
don't have any aims. We just want to enjoy.

267
00:45:35,683 --> 00:45:43,851
It’s a very, very big thing that has happened
because, as you know, the joy in the Sahastrara

268
00:45:43,876 --> 00:45:56,941
is nira-ananda, nira-ananda. Of course, Nira
is My name also, but it means pure absolute

269
00:45:56,966 --> 00:46:10,731
joy. Nira-ananda. And that nirananda, that
joy has no other hues. It’s just pure, pure

270
00:46:10,756 --> 00:46:19,951
joy. Without thinking, it just pours into
it. After all, every activity is for what,

271
00:46:19,976 --> 00:46:27,749
for getting some sort of a pleasure, sensation
and also, some people believe, for joy. It’s

272
00:46:27,774 --> 00:46:28,646
not.

273
00:46:28,951 --> 00:46:34,366
Only after the opening of Sahastrara and the
cleansing of it, then you will know what is

274
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:35,241
joy.

275
00:46:35,447 --> 00:46:41,935
You can't explain it, how you can spend hours
together like this. People don't understand.

276
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,716
Like even our mayor was telling Me that, “We
can't sit in the church for more than fifteen

277
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:54,891
minutes. And how people are sitting here for
so many hours. Fifteen minutes we cannot sit,

278
00:46:54,916 --> 00:47:01,706
but how these people are sitting for such
a long time. What are they doing there? What

279
00:47:01,706 --> 00:47:07,556
is their entertainment? How can they sit for
hours together, without saying anything, without

280
00:47:07,556 --> 00:47:14,556
dropping even a pin, they are just all the
time there. So what have you given them? What

281
00:47:14,636 --> 00:47:24,182
is happening to them?” This is very surprising
and remarkable that these people, who are

282
00:47:24,207 --> 00:47:29,916
not even sahaja yogis, can see clearly that
you people are least bothered, you are absolutely

283
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:37,570
enjoying life. Whatever you may be doing is
not important, what is important is that,

284
00:47:37,595 --> 00:47:45,381
whether you are working in the office or outside,
you are full of joy, enjoying everything.

285
00:47:46,006 --> 00:47:53,006
This is the most important thing in life,
which you can have only through Sahaja Yoga,

286
00:47:53,595 --> 00:47:59,466
because your Sahastraras are open, because
they are opened out.

287
00:47:59,466 --> 00:48:07,636
There is now one more thing I have to tell
you, that is very important for all of you

288
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:19,738
to remember: that, while living in this Ocean
of Joy, we have to remember that there are

289
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:26,961
many who have not yet jumped into it, so we
have to bring them in; and it’s such a pleasure,

290
00:48:26,986 --> 00:48:33,986
such a joy to give realisation to someone,
extremely joyful.

291
00:48:34,065 --> 00:48:42,942
So we need people who would come and say that
“We’ll definitely come for this [work].”

292
00:48:46,169 --> 00:48:55,743
I mean, they should really come forward and,
once they come forward, you'll be amazed how

293
00:48:55,768 --> 00:49:04,091
things will work out. There are many, I know,
who are going all over, everywhere and spreading

294
00:49:04,116 --> 00:49:11,611
Sahaja Yoga. So is very important for all
of you to know that you have got the light

295
00:49:11,636 --> 00:49:18,376
to be given to others. Come forward. Don't
have fear of your ego, conditionings, nothing.

296
00:49:18,376 --> 00:49:24,805
Come forward. You have all the strength, you
have everything within yourself and you will

297
00:49:24,805 --> 00:49:31,386
do everything with such happiness and joy.
Everywhere, in every country people are doing

298
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:36,426
that, but some of them are doing, some of
them are not doing. All of you are quite capable

299
00:49:36,426 --> 00:49:45,557
of doing it, so please come forward and see
for yourself what you are capable of.

300
00:49:46,256 --> 00:49:52,946
First of all you should have faith in yourself.
If you have no faith in yourself, you cannot

301
00:49:54,748 --> 00:50:04,929
do anything. Have faith. You should have no
fears of any kind. And also to introspect,

302
00:50:04,954 --> 00:50:15,164
to see within yourself what's going on. To
be very frank, I find My brain absolutely

303
00:50:15,189 --> 00:50:21,526
empty. What I talk from this emptiness, I
don't know. You will also find your brain

304
00:50:21,526 --> 00:50:31,381
absolutely empty, and still with that empty
brain, you will be achieving a lot.

305
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:37,366
It’s very remarkable, as you have seen,
that from the candle you get cool breeze.

306
00:50:37,391 --> 00:50:43,546
How you can get it from the candle, cool breeze?
You do get.

307
00:50:43,855 --> 00:50:57,336
So, is important to recognise yourself as
a Sahaja yogi and to recognise - what have

308
00:50:57,361 --> 00:51:05,848
you done for Sahaja Yoga? Without doing for
Sahaja Yoga, you cannot enjoy life. That was

309
00:51:05,873 --> 00:51:13,196
your aim and that aim you have reached. Now,
if you don't...supposing I have to come and

310
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:17,396
sit on this thing and I don't sit on this
thing, then what's the use of coming here?

311
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:25,694
I came here to tell you something about Sahastrara
and if I don't tell you, then what's the use

312
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:32,105
of My coming here and celebrating Sahastrara
Day? In the same way, when you have reached

313
00:51:32,105 --> 00:51:37,456
that state now, what you have to do is not
to use for your own purpose. You have used

314
00:51:37,456 --> 00:51:43,476
it, quite a lot, for your health, wealth,
everything. Now what are we doing about Sahaja

315
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:51,476
Yoga? What have we done for Sahaja Yoga? After
some time, you will do a lot and you will

316
00:51:51,546 --> 00:51:57,585
never know you have done anything for Sahaja
Yoga. Very surprising, it happens to so many

317
00:51:57,585 --> 00:52:07,111
of you and should happen to all of you. I
hope all of you will realise that your Sahastraras

318
00:52:07,136 --> 00:52:12,636
are cleaned, completely. You are perfectly
alright. You don't have to worry about it

319
00:52:12,636 --> 00:52:19,636
and you can really go ahead with spreading
of Sahaja Yoga.

320
00:52:21,128 --> 00:52:23,128
May God bless you all.
