1
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:06,875
It's a great day today for the whole world

2
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:17,333
that we are celebrating this Diwali Puja in America.

3
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:22,857
It's very important.

4
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:35,904
Here where people have been able to earn money,
to have lots of money sometimes,

5
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:43,937
and are also people who are ruined completely because of money.

6
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:54,127
When we talk of Diwali we should understand

7
00:05:54,185 --> 00:06:00,016
that why on a Diwali day we have all these lights.

8
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:13,754
What is the combination of lights and the
Lakshmi who was born in the water,

9
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:16,522
who stands in the water?

10
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:20,391
Why this combination is there?

11
00:06:21,103 --> 00:06:32,615
She was standing in the water, as we know,
a symbol of prosperity;

12
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:42,339
 that is built in the human awareness that it can, he can prosper.

13
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:44,944
Animals don't prosper.

14
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:54,290
They all have their maryadas, trees have their
maryadas, only the human being can prosper.

15
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:59,942
But if they have no sense of their own maryadas

16
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:06,471
then there's very ruinous, are ruinous for the whole world.

17
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:19,752
So the lights are there that all the people
who have Lakshmi's blessings must enlighten themselves,

18
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,927
 must have lights, and they should enlighten others also.

19
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:35,200
But actually, as soon as they get the Lakshmi
- so-called - they become absolutely blind,

20
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:44,975
and they forget what is behind
the blessings of the Lakshmi.

21
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:53,699
First of all, as we see, how this symbol of Lakshmi represents -
I have told you before also -

22
00:07:54,046 --> 00:08:05,237
 that a person who has Lakshmi should
be very generous.

23
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:13,044
One hand she's giving to others.

24
00:08:13,403 --> 00:08:23,391
A person who is miserly with Lakshmi is absolutely
against the principle of Lakshmi.

25
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:29,141
And such a miserly person never can enjoy the blessings;

26
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:36,413
 and gradually he starts becoming poorer and poorer.

27
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:42,571
When you start giving with the left hand,
that means

28
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:48,169
you have opened the door for your Lakshmi to come in.

29
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:57,424
Then comes the grace of Lakshmi on you.

30
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:11,035
And this grace of Lakshmi also has another
aspect, that you must give protection.

31
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:24,058
Those who are people with money should protect
like this - protect who?

32
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:35,362
Protect the people who are in trouble, people
who are having lots of cruelty on them,

33
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:39,958
orphan children who need your help.

34
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:49,540
All these should be looked into, and the protection
to the people who are dependent on you.

35
00:09:49,787 --> 00:09:53,817
So this has to be done with the right hand.

36
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:58,374
That's the symbol of Lakshmi.

37
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:08,084
And there are two hands up there, which you
have seen, with the pink color lotus.

38
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:15,957
Pink color lotus suggests that you must have
love in your heart.

39
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:20,947
Pink is the symbol of love and compassion.

40
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:30,765
As I've told you before also, a person who
has Lakshmi should have

41
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:37,074
a house where everybody's invited.

42
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:46,451
Like the lotus invites all the insects, even
the beetles who have got lots of thorns,

43
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:55,016
and the beetle comes and sleeps the whole night
very comfortably, and the lotus closes its petals

44
00:10:55,238 --> 00:11:00,499
 so that the beetle has no trouble to
be comfortable.

45
00:11:00,604 --> 00:11:11,955
So these houses must accept guests, any kind
they are, and they should be treated

46
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:22,267
very well, just like as if the Gods have come into your house.

47
00:11:22,387 --> 00:11:30,259
I've seen people who are poor are much more
hospitable than the people who are rich.

48
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:33,037
Same way about the countries.

49
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:41,935
Countries which are poor are much more hospitable
than the countries which are rich.

50
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:47,894
It's very surprising that rich countries have
their immigrations,

51
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:56,206
 they have all problems of avoiding people,
 guests in their own countries.

52
00:11:56,298 --> 00:12:02,238
So they are going really in the wrong way as far as

53
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,273
 the Lakshmi symbols are concerned.

54
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,405
The another very important symbol is that
she stands on a lotus.

55
00:12:11,516 --> 00:12:20,565
It's all glorified, all beautiful lotuses
carrying her: but lotus suggests that she

56
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:32,788
throws no pressures, no imbalances, no power around.

57
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:40,656
But in these countries where people have money,
they try to throw power all around.

58
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:45,427
And one who has money becomes the more powerful person.

59
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:49,165
Everything becomes power.

60
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:53,714
Money is power, love is power.

61
00:12:54,285 --> 00:13:05,955
This power has no divinity in it, but a power
of oppression and aggression and self-importance.

62
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:12,092
All these symbols of the Lakshmi are very

63
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:16,607
convincing, that today when we say that somebody has got money,

64
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:22,322
or some country or nation, they are just
the opposite of what they should have been.

65
00:13:23,447 --> 00:13:27,057
The reason is they are not enlightened.

66
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:35,970
They have to have lights in their heart, as
we see that in Diwali, there has to be the light;

67
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:49,526
 and without enlightenment these rich
people, so-called Lakshmipathis, become nonsensical.

68
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:53,243
That's why there has to be the light.

69
00:13:53,359 --> 00:14:01,288
Because with Lakshmi one can become absolutely
blind - so-called Lakshmi, doesn't give you

70
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:08,568
proper understanding as to what it means that
you have got money, that you are rich.

71
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:10,249
What does that mean?

72
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:13,805
That's why one has to have the lights.

73
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:21,664
Unless and until you have light of divinity
within you, you won't understand

74
00:14:22,082 --> 00:14:25,143
 the great symbol of Lakshmi.

75
00:14:25,336 --> 00:14:33,471
But in Sahaja Yoga we believe that the Lakshmi
must become Mahalakshmi.

76
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,440
Man has to become greater, [SOUNDS LIKE MAHAMANAVA].

77
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,410
What does that mean?

78
00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:47,423
That she has to become the Mahalakshmi.

79
00:14:47,545 --> 00:15:03,515
Mahalakshmi is a Deity which makes you absolutely
satisfied with whatever you have.

80
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:05,952
Complete satisfaction.

81
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:16,616
Not only that, but you start thinking that
"Whatever I have is not sufficient -

82
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:19,416
 I have to have something else!

83
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:26,526
Not money, not more cars, not more televisions
and things,

84
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:33,287
but I have to have something else
that will give me real satisfaction."

85
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:41,104
You know the law of economics is that you
are never satisfied.

86
00:15:41,277 --> 00:15:49,105
Nothing is satiable, so you go on buying from
one to another to another to another, another.

87
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:55,700
But when the Mahalakshmi principle shines in you,

88
00:15:55,806 --> 00:16:00,941
then you do not want any more.

89
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:08,641
You want to give it to others and you want
to enjoy your generosity.

90
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:15,381
That is the first sign that you are moving
now from Lakshmi to Mahalakshmi.

91
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:23,556
Till the Lakshmi principle, you were blind;
and whatever it was,

92
00:16:23,656 --> 00:16:29,921
you were more asking for more things
and more things, and more things.

93
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:39,837
After this is over, then you have the light
enlightenment.

94
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:53,677
When you have done all the four things properly
- that is generosity, protection and hospitality and compassion -

95
00:16:54,287 --> 00:17:04,599
 then you get into another mood of movement

96
00:17:04,677 --> 00:17:12,392
because you know nothing is satisfying, nothing is satiable.

97
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:19,540
Running from one thing to another, then that
to another, that to another.

98
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:30,438
And when such people get collective, they
start ways and methods of attracting people

99
00:17:30,636 --> 00:17:33,524
how they could extract money.

100
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,373
There's so many ways.

101
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,230
Like in our Italy when I was there, I wanted to buy shoes.

102
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:46,731
We went to the shop and they had only one type of shoe.

103
00:17:46,827 --> 00:17:51,151
That kind I don't wear, so said, "No."

104
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:54,686
Now, "Only this year this kind."

105
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:57,737
"Only this kind?"

106
00:17:57,737 --> 00:18:00,127
"Every shop will have this."

107
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:05,564
I said, "People have no sense, they have no life within them.

108
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:09,527
So next year, you'll have another style."

109
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:16,988
Whatever is produced is always new, and these
shoes that were made last year

110
00:18:17,043 --> 00:18:22,638
 or before that are put into some sort of a junk.

111
00:18:23,442 --> 00:18:26,192
It's a very big business.

112
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:36,983
So it is the big business that starts in this
manner, and many people become bankrupt,

113
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:45,562
many people completely lose their dignity, and
fall into the trap of immorality.

114
00:18:46,664 --> 00:18:50,458
So this Lakshmi principle if you forget,

115
00:18:50,513 --> 00:18:55,232
 in a proper way you cannot go to the Mahalakshmi principle.

116
00:18:55,643 --> 00:19:08,124
And in the Mahalakshmi way you can find another
kind of personalities,

117
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:13,040
because if you have the light in your heart,

118
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:20,011
then you start seeing that this money business is of no satisfaction.

119
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:24,663
You go on changing from one to another.

120
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:28,078
So then you think, "What should we do?"

121
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:33,610
With this light in your heart, you find out that you have to follow

122
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:39,832
now the principle of Mahalakshmi otherwise you'll be lost.

123
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:48,075
So when you think of Mahalakshmi you start
seeking, seeking the way by which

124
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:54,253
 you can really have a real satisfaction of life.

125
00:19:56,355 --> 00:20:01,445
I mean a country like America where people
have so much money and everything,

126
00:20:01,596 --> 00:20:08,115
 they have also the maximum number of seekers - maximum.

127
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:16,083
When I first came to America I was shocked
that though there was Mahalakshmi principle,

128
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:22,852
they did not know what to seek and they all
followed all kinds of false gurus.

129
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:30,938
They had become mad, I think, because they
couldn't understand what is to befall be followed.

130
00:20:31,152 --> 00:20:38,562
For that they started following all kinds of false gurus,

131
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:47,251
who were themselves slaves of Lakshmi - Lakshmitattwa - slaves in the
sense 'who were against' Lakshmitattwa.

132
00:20:47,402 --> 00:20:54,313
And that's how they all were lost, so many
of were lost in this country, and I was shocked

133
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:58,678
the way they were following wrong type of
people I just thought that

134
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:03,420
there's something really needed to be done to this country.

135
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:07,535
And for nine years I never came to America.

136
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:14,267
I am sorry for that, because the seekers were
moving in the opposite direction.

137
00:21:14,604 --> 00:21:22,540
They were not in the understanding as to what
the seeking is for.

138
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:25,765
What are you seeking?

139
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:37,323
Somebody came saying that "You are, I am a
sixteen-year-old and I can make you all realized souls."

140
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:46,791
And I'm told that he put some vermilion
kumkum in a gun and blasted it,

141
00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:51,035
and people felt they were all, already have gone to heavens.

142
00:21:51,234 --> 00:21:57,174
Such idiotic behavior; how it came into their heads, I don't know.

143
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:01,008
How did they become so idiotic, I can't understand.

144
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:08,294
So I went back and I said: "I can't help these people much."

145
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:15,521
Then a kind of another fashion started.

146
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:23,085
Like if you went to any party or anything
they would say, "Now see, another guru has come.

147
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:25,585
He's much cheaper.

148
00:22:25,832 --> 00:22:29,205
And But also there's a sale on."

149
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,730
And I would say "Look at these women and men

150
00:22:33,864 --> 00:22:41,740
who are supposed to be the leaders of the world,
 and how can they talk like this?"

151
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:48,899
It was a very common thing among the rich people to talk like that.

152
00:22:50,256 --> 00:22:58,959
This country has been blessed with very, very
great people, as you know, very great.

153
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:03,893
Abraham Lincoln - what sort of a man he was.

154
00:23:03,923 --> 00:23:06,832
Or even say George Washington.

155
00:23:07,007 --> 00:23:12,354
All these people showed the quality of Mahalakshmi.

156
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:22,948
But they didn't much think of them, and they started working out
 a new method of capturing the whole world,

157
00:23:23,097 --> 00:23:31,711
 because, then the idea of power came into their heads;
 that with money we can purchase everything.

158
00:23:32,281 --> 00:23:37,519
We can make everybody dance to our tune if we have money.

159
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:50,036
All this attitude towards money
and human beings was absolutely satanic -

160
00:23:50,183 --> 00:23:56,249
to such an extent that their own country started getting ruined.

161
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:59,558
What happened to the family system?

162
00:23:59,823 --> 00:24:01,471
What has happened?

163
00:24:01,576 --> 00:24:03,231
Why the family got ruined?

164
00:24:03,256 --> 00:24:08,457
Because of the wrong ideas about Lakshmi principle.

165
00:24:08,575 --> 00:24:13,118
The women got lots of money out of divorce.

166
00:24:13,316 --> 00:24:19,548
So I've met one lady, she had divorced
her husband eight times, from this country,

167
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:23,902
now I'm told she has divorced the nintandh one.

168
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,463
And she has become very rich.

169
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:28,757
But she has no shame.

170
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:36,873
And she is telling everybody that "Get a divorce,
 that's the best way, that's the advantage of coming to America."

171
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:44,468
So what is the problem that human beings don't have enlightenment.

172
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:51,996
And if they get money, and if they are hankering after things,

173
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:54,472
they have to go to hell, no doubt about it -

174
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:02,140
and do all kinds of things which was never done
 in the history of this world.

175
00:25:02,443 --> 00:25:06,894
I need not tell you all the absurd nonsensical things they do.

176
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:18,510
Then started a negatives force of drug,
drinking and all kinds of things.

177
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:27,489
I mean such blindness, such stupidity, that you can't understand.

178
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:36,782
As if their brains were completely curtailed
 by the activity of moneymaking.

179
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:45,969
I've seen people choosing their suits
and clothes that when they will die,

180
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:49,310
what they are going to wear.

181
00:25:49,343 --> 00:25:51,667
It sounds funny.

182
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:58,826
Even their dog dies they make such elaborate arrangements.

183
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:08,234
They choose even their coffin -
which one they would like to use for burying.

184
00:26:08,518 --> 00:26:15,064
So with the money a new problem started, was the choice.

185
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,413
What choice you have.

186
00:26:17,572 --> 00:26:22,940
And people played with that choice.

187
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:31,787
They can befool you and tell you what is the best.

188
00:26:31,912 --> 00:26:37,973
I don't know why, but moneyed people are mostly idiotic,

189
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:44,074
 if not very immoral. Idiotic, absolutely idiotic.

190
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,581
Anybody can [INAUDIBLE] befool them.

191
00:26:46,923 --> 00:26:55,662
So, God knows what is the speciality that the people
 who are very rich can be very cunning,

192
00:26:55,785 --> 00:27:04,756
can be very immoral, can be self-destroying;
but mostly they are idiotic people.

193
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:14,704
Because the way they talk, you don't know where to look;
what they say about things you don't understand.

194
00:27:14,963 --> 00:27:20,450
So then it's become the country of idiots and stupid people,

195
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,942
and you don't know how to deal with them

196
00:27:23,004 --> 00:27:30,525
and how to talk to them about, about the higher life.

197
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:38,429
This Lakshmitattwa has to become a much bigger principle,

198
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:56,428
which we call as the 'emancipated personality'.

199
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:03,290
Or we can say 'person endowed with Mahalakshmi principle'.

200
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:12,488
Such a person may be cheated by others, may be troubled by others,

201
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:20,675
but such a person has its own inner power
 to overcome all such hurdles.

202
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:30,188
So this Mahalakshmi principle should be established:
but one would say "Why?

203
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:36,899
What is the advantage of having Mahalakshmi principle?"

204
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:55,025
When the Mahalakshmi principle comes,
 then there are nine Lakshmis which are described,

205
00:28:55,050 --> 00:29:02,921
navadha, nine, which get completely manifested in a human being.

206
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:07,374
One of them as we call as Gruhalakshmi.

207
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:10,846
Gruhalakshmi means the family.

208
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:18,163
The wife becomes a very wonderful person.

209
00:29:18,335 --> 00:29:23,508
She doesn't object to things, she doesn't react,

210
00:29:23,652 --> 00:29:32,271
 but she is very sensible and she builds  up
all her children in a beautiful manner.

211
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:39,276
On the contrary, where she is not a Gruhalakshmi

212
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:46,477
she takes pride in working out something like men.

213
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:55,288
Means to her, her job is important, her bank balance is important.

214
00:29:55,522 --> 00:30:04,845
But the real bank balance of a Gruhalakshmi
is her family and her children.

215
00:30:05,354 --> 00:30:11,109
If she doesn't have that, she will be just

216
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:17,378
thinking that she is very great,
she can complete with this man or that man.

217
00:30:19,605 --> 00:30:25,746
Women don't understand that their greatest capacity is to love.

218
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:34,040
How is it that Lakshmi is a woman and all the Goddesses are women?

219
00:30:34,294 --> 00:30:39,910
And what is the quality of these Goddesses

220
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:48,454
 is to bestow blessings on people of their own nature,
of their own qualities.

221
00:30:50,617 --> 00:30:59,346
So to think that we are better off than men
because we have more money is the greatest idiocity.

222
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:07,362
You may have money, but your children will be ruined,
your family will be ruined.

223
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:17,645
When you make a good family, then you create a beautiful,
very beautiful, universe around;

224
00:31:17,772 --> 00:31:26,513
and universes after universes like this can create
a beautiful universe in the whole world.

225
00:31:27,073 --> 00:31:31,573
There's nothing to sacrifice, but to enjoy everything.

226
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:40,123
As I said, you enjoy your hospitality,

227
00:31:40,388 --> 00:31:51,848
 you enjoy your generosity - which you do not
 feel is a misery or a trouble to you -

228
00:31:52,172 --> 00:31:55,124
but you just enjoy.

229
00:31:55,271 --> 00:31:58,010
At least I enjoy.

230
00:31:58,268 --> 00:32:03,642
If I can give something to someone, that's the greatest blessing.

231
00:32:04,207 --> 00:32:12,295
So the idiotic people, they believe that generosity is stupidity,

232
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:16,306
while they are the real stupidity.

233
00:32:16,455 --> 00:32:26,063
So to create a proper home for your children is a very great work today,

234
00:32:26,189 --> 00:32:28,765
 and it has to be done.

235
00:32:29,652 --> 00:32:34,149
Again there, selfishness comes.

236
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:41,499
Human beings have so many, such hurdles in life because,

237
00:32:41,804 --> 00:32:47,121
I don't know why, he doesn't enjoy everything.

238
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:55,538
So the selfishness comes in and they will only love their own children,

239
00:32:55,652 --> 00:32:58,619
 they will only love their own husbands,

240
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:03,067
 or they will love only their own wives.

241
00:33:03,205 --> 00:33:05,763
This doesn't create a good family.

242
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:09,736
I am talking about the global family.

243
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:19,377
For us everybody is a realized soul
and their family and our family is one.

244
00:33:19,615 --> 00:33:24,439
But then they will create problems, talk ill, gossip.

245
00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:32,150
I am surprised even in Sahaja Yoga
we have many women who just go on gossiping,

246
00:33:32,364 --> 00:33:34,674
 their style was gossiping.

247
00:33:34,737 --> 00:33:42,112
Because I am talking about Lakshmi and Mahalakshmi
I have to warn the women

248
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:53,458
because they are the ones who will create the great principles,
the great symbols of Lakshmi and Mahalakshmi.

249
00:33:53,889 --> 00:34:00,363
So gossiping is a very common disease even today in Sahaja Yoga.

250
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:05,913
I've seen then [SOUNDS LIKE while inside],
 five or six Sahaja Yoginis meet,

251
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:08,353
they go on talking, talking, talking -

252
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:12,424
I don't know what do they talk - never about Sahaja Yoga, never.

253
00:34:12,462 --> 00:34:19,058
What they talk is 'what's wrong with another person',
 'who is a wrong type of a person'

254
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:21,316
- that we call 'gossip'.

255
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:27,354
And this gossip has created big problems for us in the collective.

256
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,990
So best thing I would advise to keep quiet.

257
00:34:31,015 --> 00:34:34,159
Even when they come to my house they talk.

258
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,612
They have no sense that they should keep quiet.

259
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:45,500
Without quietude you cannot enjoy the cool vibrations of the Divine.

260
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:57,304
Just go on gossiping and talking is not a sign
of very developed people in Sahaja Yoga.

261
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:04,771
That's why the first thing is that women
 should become much more compassionate,

262
00:35:04,796 --> 00:35:09,702
much more tolerant and enjoyable.

263
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,771
Because you meet somebody, they will start immediately telling you,

264
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,702
 "That is wrong with this person, this is wrong with that person..."

265
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:19,837
But there's no need.

266
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:23,836
But they will only come and give you bad news - all kinds.

267
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:29,998
But they enjoy, giving the bad news,
that they think they are very important.

268
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:38,651
And when they think they are important,
they can be very dangerous people, very dangerous.

269
00:35:41,115 --> 00:35:48,443
 Because I think it's the women who have to work
 it out much more than men,

270
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:52,527
 to understand the value of Sahaja Yoga.

271
00:35:52,982 --> 00:35:56,825
Because their own children are concerned,

272
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:01,657
their family is one of the units of Sahaja Yoga.

273
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:06,091
I am saying this because now I have been noticing it very common,

274
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:15,843
 that the women in Sahaja Yoga are not up to the point
 as they should have been.

275
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:18,522
They gossip too much.

276
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:24,527
So they should take to mauna I think,
take to complete silence, not talk.

277
00:36:24,908 --> 00:36:35,048
Those who are really very much effective,
who are doing the great work, are always quiet.

278
00:36:35,198 --> 00:36:36,711
They don't talk.

279
00:36:36,756 --> 00:36:41,949
I have seen they don't even come and see me, just recede back,

280
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:50,593
while the women who think they are something special -
 they are the most dangerous.

281
00:36:50,625 --> 00:37:03,431
So the power of Lakshmi that actually first falls
on the shoulder of women should be Mahalakshmi's.

282
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:19,072
And this one is, is a challenge to all the Sahaja Yoginis
to behave themselves,

283
00:37:19,435 --> 00:37:25,738
and to become greater women than all the
 rest of the women of the world.

284
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:31,043
We have some very, very good, very great Sahaja Yoginis, no doubt.

285
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:38,462
But their style is different,
and they are working out things in such a manner

286
00:37:38,487 --> 00:37:41,630
 that it's absolutely adorable.

287
00:37:41,836 --> 00:37:44,860
They are just working for Sahaja Yoga.

288
00:37:44,954 --> 00:37:51,589
They do not bother about their personal relationships,
or their personal eminence,

289
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,580
they just want to help Sahaja Yoga in every way.

290
00:37:57,819 --> 00:38:02,218
Then there is another Lakshmi called as Gajalakshmi.

291
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:05,769
Actually it means Gaja means elephant.

292
00:38:06,145 --> 00:38:12,798
What is the quality of an elephant is that
the elephant walks with a certain gait,

293
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:16,615
which is the movement on both the sides.

294
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:25,882
As I've said you, I've seen people, especially women,
who walk like horses, really -

295
00:38:26,215 --> 00:38:28,298
they just walk like horses.

296
00:38:28,323 --> 00:38:39,142
So once a dance teacher told me,
"Should I start, Mother, a dance school?"

297
00:38:39,378 --> 00:38:42,758
I said, "Better start a dance school, doesn't matter.

298
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:48,720
But are you sure you can teach them to dance
 or they will be just galloping?"

299
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:50,219
"Why?"

300
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:56,164
"Because what I've seen of women here that
they walk like horses, I must say.

301
00:38:56,327 --> 00:39:03,529
How can these women who walk like horses can
[laughs] can do dance, Indian dance specially.

302
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:05,156
It's very difficult."

303
00:39:05,237 --> 00:39:11,493
So, now we have to see what is the gait, how you walk.

304
00:39:12,398 --> 00:39:18,332
Do you walk like an elephant, or you walk like a horse?

305
00:39:18,478 --> 00:39:24,613
Especially for men, men should not walk like elephant
but should walk like horses, all right.

306
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:34,290
But the worst thing that has happened is that men dress up like women

307
00:39:34,315 --> 00:39:36,428
and women dress up like man.

308
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:38,087
Now what to do?

309
00:39:38,112 --> 00:39:45,459
Why this kind of a mad transformation taking place?

310
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,210
Why do they take to such things?

311
00:39:49,252 --> 00:40:02,136
For, what is the advantage of becoming a woman
when he is a man, and a woman becoming a man?

312
00:40:02,172 --> 00:40:08,232
That is the reason, it which shows, that they
want to have some change -

313
00:40:08,257 --> 00:40:10,162
 some change is important.

314
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:14,542
You'd like to change your dress,
you'd like to change your houses,

315
00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:17,377
even your sexes you want to change.

316
00:40:17,402 --> 00:40:26,399
But why not change your complete being through self-realization.

317
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,249
That is very important, to understand that
we are transformed,

318
00:40:32,368 --> 00:40:38,034
and we must have our own dignity of Sahaja Yoga -

319
00:40:38,423 --> 00:40:46,584
 the way we behave, the way we move about and work.

320
00:40:47,818 --> 00:40:55,206
My experience is that once they come to Sahaja Yoga, mostly,

321
00:40:55,231 --> 00:41:02,474
they become very, very beautiful people;

322
00:41:03,036 --> 00:41:12,284
and that gradually start growing like
flowers, fragrant with their compassion and love.

323
00:41:12,646 --> 00:41:19,088
But also there are people who do not understand how to grow.

324
00:41:19,606 --> 00:41:25,563
They have their own small circle into which they move,

325
00:41:25,813 --> 00:41:30,965
and they get just stagnated, they become dwarfed.

326
00:41:31,126 --> 00:41:36,128
And then such Sahaja Yogis have to leave Sahaja
Yoga.

327
00:41:36,588 --> 00:41:46,522
So it is the responsibility of all the Sahaja
Yogis to watch and see how far their mind is working.

328
00:41:47,378 --> 00:41:49,433
Where are they going?

329
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:51,512
What are they doing?

330
00:41:51,553 --> 00:42:00,755
How are they achieving their status as Sahaja Yogis?

331
00:42:01,949 --> 00:42:15,107
So these Lakshmi and, Lakshmis I would say,
and also the Lakshmipatis in Sahaja Yoga have

332
00:42:15,185 --> 00:42:20,992
to be very different than the other people
who have money.

333
00:42:23,306 --> 00:42:34,736
Mahalakshmi principle should give you a very sober,
 balanced, affectionate and loving temperament.

334
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:40,732
If it doesn't give you, then you should know
there's something missing.

335
00:42:40,876 --> 00:42:47,487
After all, you have come to Sahaja Yoga
not for anything else but for your growth.

336
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:58,415
And to keep that growth on, you have to acquire
a sense of understanding what should be your,

337
00:42:58,488 --> 00:43:08,793
your personality - relative to others, relative
to other people who are still seeking,

338
00:43:08,857 --> 00:43:16,911
who are still blind, we have to achieve a global emancipation.

339
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,286
I know that's my vision is, and the other day we were counting

340
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:25,285
 how many projects have started.

341
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:28,042
So, we had to stop at 35.

342
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:37,133
Already 35 projects have started in India, also in other countries,

343
00:43:37,603 --> 00:43:45,022
and they are only for emancipating human beings.

344
00:43:46,508 --> 00:43:54,793
But firstly, as I told you, to do work in
Sahaja Yoga you have to be a detached person.

345
00:43:55,024 --> 00:44:02,292
That is the quality of a Mahalakshmi principle,
that such a person is detached.

346
00:44:03,144 --> 00:44:07,475
He is not attached to things which are worthless.

347
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:13,149
But that doesn't mean that you take a sanyasa
and run away from the family,

348
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:17,233
run away from your household, run away from ...

349
00:44:17,353 --> 00:44:20,836
 that's not detachment, that's running away.

350
00:44:21,128 --> 00:44:28,309
But detachment is that when you have everything,
still you are detached:

351
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:37,163
 in the sense you do not feel concerned
 about your own gain out of this.

352
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:47,438
Such things can happen, very easily, if you really introspect.

353
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:52,806
And introspection is the best way of meditation.

354
00:44:53,049 --> 00:44:59,052
First introspect and then meditate, then you will grow.

355
00:44:59,088 --> 00:45:08,508
And the real joy of yourself, of your Spirit,
will really give you such enjoyment

356
00:45:08,613 --> 00:45:13,936
that you will not take to stupid, insignificant things.

357
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:21,870
But you will become very significant people
in Sahaja Yoga who will do such wonderful work

358
00:45:22,032 --> 00:45:28,509
 that everybody will be amazed that an
ordinary human being,

359
00:45:28,534 --> 00:45:33,612
 how can he achieve such things, how can he work it out?

360
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:39,781
As I've told you before, that after realization
you become extremely creative -

361
00:45:39,912 --> 00:45:45,742
 creative in everything, specially in giving realization
to others,

362
00:45:45,885 --> 00:45:53,965
and also creating creative in your life of art,

363
00:45:53,990 --> 00:46:00,129
 music, poetry, drama, writing - all kinds of things you do.

364
00:46:00,367 --> 00:46:04,153
We have seen now so many cases who have never been

365
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:11,564
 on the stage, even, have given very great, inspiring lectures.

366
00:46:11,716 --> 00:46:16,588
So the creativity comes like an inspiration for others.

367
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:19,180
They see you and they feel inspired.

368
00:46:19,468 --> 00:46:23,759
You are not the one who goes into the shadow and sits back.

369
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:25,901
But openly you come out.

370
00:46:25,926 --> 00:46:35,291
With no pride or no sort of aggression, but
complete humility;

371
00:46:35,397 --> 00:46:39,561
 and you give such beautiful feelings to others,

372
00:46:39,586 --> 00:46:44,591
such understanding about yourself and about the other

373
00:46:44,616 --> 00:46:47,265
through yourcollective consciousness.

374
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:53,766
See about collective consciousness and other
things, so many people have talked.

375
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:58,525
The other day you saw it, there were so many people like Jung

376
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:07,239
and also there were other scientists and also other philosophers who
have talked about it.

377
00:47:07,264 --> 00:47:12,674
But you have got it, you have the experience
of collective consciousness.

378
00:47:12,812 --> 00:47:18,935
Despite that, if you are lagging behind

379
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,711
in your progress of Sahaja Yoga, in Sahaja Yoga,
that means there is something wrong.

380
00:47:23,736 --> 00:47:27,679
Some sort of a load you are carrying on your head.

381
00:47:27,822 --> 00:47:33,013
But through our attachments, there could be loads on your head.

382
00:47:33,246 --> 00:47:39,502
In Sahaja Yoga you are involved with everything and you are detached.

383
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:45,266
And such a miracle happens to you which
you know very well, I don't have to describe it.

384
00:47:45,706 --> 00:47:51,636
So a new personality with a Mahalakshmi principle comes in.

385
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:56,865
Mahalakshmi principle is the one which takes you to your seeking

386
00:47:56,913 --> 00:48:00,553
and when you have found out the reality,  the truth,

387
00:48:00,874 --> 00:48:02,890
 then you progress.

388
00:48:02,915 --> 00:48:08,059
With Mahalakshmi principle only, you get your
realization.

389
00:48:08,084 --> 00:48:13,780
You know that very well, that through the
Mahalakshmi channel only you rise,

390
00:48:13,805 --> 00:48:16,467
and you get your realization.

391
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:27,410
So to become a great Sahaja Yogi,
 you have to look after your Mahalakshmi principle.

392
00:48:27,435 --> 00:48:33,025
Now there are people I have seen who care for cheap popularity.

393
00:48:34,008 --> 00:48:38,014
I have known people who will do everything
for others,

394
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:41,437
do this, do that, but only for popularity.

395
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:49,379
There's no - essentially understood - they
have not essentially understood that

396
00:48:49,404 --> 00:48:53,397
 whatever you are doing, is it for cheap popularity?

397
00:48:53,872 --> 00:48:57,501
You don't have to fight an election in Sahaja Yoga,

398
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,676
you don't have to cast your votes in an election.

399
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:07,668
But what happens daily, the person who has
that dynamism of Sahaja Yoga

400
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:11,058
 just comes up. Everybody knows.

401
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:21,468
Not talking, not impressing, not showing off,
not going after cheap popularity,

402
00:49:21,493 --> 00:49:28,018
 but growing within - for that I cannot say what you have to do.

403
00:49:28,043 --> 00:49:31,210
How does a tree grow? By itself.

404
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:35,022
You are living examples of Sahaja Yoga.

405
00:49:35,198 --> 00:49:38,308
So how will you grow by yourself?

406
00:49:38,492 --> 00:49:44,955
By yourself you'll grow - is a promise that
is given to you by the Divine.

407
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:52,414
But allow it to grow, through introspection and meditation,

408
00:49:52,797 --> 00:49:58,858
 and what we call complete dedication and devotion.

409
00:49:58,924 --> 00:50:07,317
The other day I told you about the word shraddha
- it's not just praying, it's not just having faith,

410
00:50:07,448 --> 00:50:13,285
but shraddha is that you have it in your heart -

411
00:50:13,381 --> 00:50:20,835
the enjoyment of achievement through your devotion and dedication,

412
00:50:20,932 --> 00:50:24,061
 that should be called as shraddha.

413
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,575
With that thing only it will work out.

414
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:32,752
But you have to have faith in yourself and
faith in Sahaja Yoga.

415
00:50:32,884 --> 00:50:38,020
You know you have got it, those people were
talking about it, but you have got it -

416
00:50:38,025 --> 00:50:40,536
 you know what is collective consciousness.

417
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:43,475
You know that you are in the collective consciousness.

418
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:47,698
But how far you have grown into it is to be seen.

419
00:50:47,723 --> 00:50:49,284
It's very important.

420
00:50:49,308 --> 00:50:56,061
For that, I need not in this short time describe
to you all the qualities of the Lakshmi but

421
00:50:56,085 --> 00:51:05,872
try to understand that a person who has Lakshmi
principle has to have all these special qualities

422
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:10,438
otherwise he is not the worshiper of Lakshmi.

423
00:51:11,366 --> 00:51:16,838
And that's how I would today bless you all with the proper wisdom

424
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:20,697
and the proper understanding of the Lakshmi principle

425
00:51:20,764 --> 00:51:24,488
 through the lights which are enlightened within your heart.

426
00:51:24,512 --> 00:51:26,092
May God Bless You.

427
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:37,404
May God Bless You.
