1
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,500
- I bow to all the seekers of Truth.
- [INTERPRETER]

2
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,100
As I told you yesterday that Truth is not a concept

3
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,380
- [INTERPRETER]

4
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:55,360
When people start establishing something as Truth

5
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,340
- [INTERPRETER]

6
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,000
- there arises the problem
- [INTERPRETER]

7
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,640
because Truth cannot be organized,

8
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,860
cannot be ordered, cannot be changed - it is what it is.

9
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:26,720
- [INTERPRETER]

10
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,500
And today the Truth is, that the time has come

11
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,540
for people to get their resurrection,

12
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,880
- [INTERPRETER]

13
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:53,060
that the time has come where people have to ascend to their higher being.

14
00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:00,040
- [INTERPRETER]

15
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,220
As in Koran described very clearly, is Kiama - is the time of resurrection.

16
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,180
- [INTERPRETER]

17
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,000
Said very clearly, that your hands will speak

18
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,740
- [INTERPRETER]

19
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,220
- and they will give witness about.
- [INTERPRETER]

20
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,640
- This is time of Last Judgment.
- [INTERPRETER]

21
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,400
God is not going to weigh people to judge them.

22
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,380
- [INTERPRETER]

23
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,800
It is you only, in your ascent, are going to judge yourself.

24
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,700
- [INTERPRETER]

25
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:06,460
And there are people who are a special category today, who are seeking something higher.

26
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,920
- [INTERPRETER]

27
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:22,400
- Now, yesterday a question was raised about the religion part.
- [INTERPRETER]

28
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,680
All these religions which have come on this earth,

29
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,540
are product of Divine force.

30
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,000
- [INTERPRETER]

31
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,600
All the prophets and Incarnations, all of them came on this earth

32
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,520
to propound a special milestone within us.

33
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:57,340
- [INTERPRETER]

34
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,700
On the tree of life, all of them grew one after another

35
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,100
- [INTERPRETER]
- but people

36
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:22,600
took out or removed them from the tree of life saying, "This is my religion, this is my religion."

37
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,060
- [INTERPRETER]

38
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,360
- So believing into something that is dead.
- [INTERPRETER]

39
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,560
So, what we see today, is a mess

40
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:51,640
- [INTERPRETER]
- and people can't understand
- [INTERPRETER]

41
00:05:52,080 --> 00:06:00,280
- how those who profess a particular religion
- [INTERPRETER]
- act just the opposite of it.

42
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:08,220
- [INTERPRETER]
- I've seen people who live, say, in Riyadh -

43
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:16,100
- [INTERPRETER]
- they don't drink, they don't look at women because  they're frightened - their eyes

44
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,640
will be pierced through or they will be put in the jail, if they do these things.

45
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,740
- [INTERPRETER]

46
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,540
- [INTERPRETER]

47
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,180
- but when they come to London, they drink like nobody's business.

48
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,160
- [INTERPRETER]

49
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,880
They have all kinds of relationships which are very ugly.

50
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,980
- [INTERPRETER]
- What happens to them that under fear

51
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,520
they work this way and under freedom they behave in a different manner.

52
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:07,880
- [INTERPRETER]

53
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,920
- Same we can say about political theories.
- [INTERPRETER]

54
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,660
I went to Russia and Russian people in Russia

55
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,860
are quite alright under fear

56
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:32,660
- [INTERPRETER]
- but when they are given freedom

57
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:40,780
- when they are given freedom they behave like anybody else.
- [INTERPRETER]

58
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,660
And also in America if you go,

59
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,280
the freedom of people is abandonment.

60
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,600
[INTERPRETER]

61
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:03,000
You can't walk on the street of New York with your purse in your hand.

62
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,620
[INTERPRETER]

63
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,780
- They're all crazy people there.
- [INTERPRETER]

64
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:19,660
- Uh... they're so immature,
- [INTERPRETER]
- worse than children even.
- [INTERPRETER]

65
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,580
- Sometimes you can't understand them.
- [INTERPRETER]

66
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,860
About two years back we saw a feature from Hollywood

67
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,520
where they showed, very old -

68
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,440
about eighty - all the actors and actresses coming for a dance.

69
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:48,060
[INTERPRETER]

70
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,700
They were very stupidly dressed with all their bones showing

71
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,280
[INTERPRETER]

72
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,320
- and they had come for a shake dance.
- [INTERPRETER]

73
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,360
Right from the Limousine when they were getting out they were already shaking.

74
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,940
[INTERPRETER]

75
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,900
- So they try to compete with the young.
- [INTERPRETER]

76
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,380
- So there is no maturity in their freedom.
- [INTERPRETER]

77
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:35,660
Is such an abandonment of all the value system, all relationships, such impurities!

78
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,640
[INTERPRETER]

79
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:48,680
I went there in the year 1973 and told them about this AIDS will be coming very soon.

80
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,900
- Well
- [INTERPRETER]

81
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:02,960
- and all the homosexuals were so angry with Me - they were about to beat Me
- [INTERPRETER]

82
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,100
and even today, it's a martyrdom there for them to get this disease.

83
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,740
[INTERPRETER]

84
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,860
- Schizophrenic are so common.
- [INTERPRETER]

85
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,360
- So what's the use of this freedom?
- [INTERPRETER]

86
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,060
- Man has no wisdom to use his freedom
- [INTERPRETER]

87
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,460
nor has he any wisdom to use his money.

88
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,780
[INTERPRETER]

89
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,500
Anybody who gets an extra money, he goes to something which is self-destructive.

90
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,400
[INTERPRETER]

91
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,760
The wisdom is so much lacking; There's no discrimination also

92
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:07,160
- [INTERPRETER]
 - to decide what is right for you and what is wrong for you.

93
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,540
- [INTERPRETER]

94
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:18,200
So, under these circumstances, the religions, so called, also have to take the shape.

95
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,640
- [INTERPRETER]

96
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,680
They are not religions in any way because

97
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,720
there is no enlightenment within.

98
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,140
- [INTERPRETER]

99
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,140
- You do not become anything.
- [INTERPRETER]

100
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,720
In Sahaja yoga, we have Jews, we have Muslims, we have Christians, we have Hindus -

101
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:54,200
- people coming from all sides.
- [INTERPRETER]

102
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,340
- [INTERPRETER]
- but

103
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:06,240
- they do not fight, they do not quarrel,
- [INTERPRETER]

104
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,620
- there is no hankering after positions
- [INTERPRETER]

105
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,200
- because they can see themselves clearly.
- [INTERPRETER]

106
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:26,380
- and they can see others also very clearly
- [INTERPRETER]
- This is wisdom.
- [INTERPRETER]

107
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,480
- In the animal kingdom no animal kills another animal.

108
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,200
- [INTERPRETER]
- Even a tiger doesn't kill another tiger

109
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:45,460
-  [INTERPRETER]
- There are certain qualities of a tiger, will remain with the tiger

110
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,380
[INTERPRETER]

111
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,740
But human-beings are so unpredictable because of their sense of freedom;

112
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,480
They could be a scorpion one day, tomorrow a tiger and third a serpent.

113
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,480
[INTERPRETER]

114
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,820
[INTERPRETER]

115
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,240
What is the reason for this kind of absurd behaviour?

116
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,540
[INTERPRETER]

117
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,420
The reason is that we live with rationality

118
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,800
- [INTERPRETER]
- and not with logic.
- [INTERPRETER]

119
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,280
A, even if somebody murders someone, there's a rationality behind it.

120
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,940
[INTERPRETER]

121
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,800
The logic can only come when you have achieved an Absolute sense.

122
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,600
[INTERPRETER]

123
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,600
As you see here the flowers - everybody sees they're flowers here.

124
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,560
[INTERPRETER]

125
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,980
Nobody is going to quarrel with them, whether it is flower or fruit

126
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,820
[INTERPRETER]

127
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,440
because they see it, absolutely they know it is flowers, everyone knows they are flowers.

128
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,700
[INTERPRETER]

129
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:30,200
In the same way, unless and until you have knowledge of propriety,

130
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,380
of right and wrong, how will you say what is right, what is wrong.

131
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:43,460
[INTERPRETER]

132
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,260
- One goes on compromising
- [INTERPRETER]
- with wrong

133
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:58,840
- [INTERPRETER]
- and thinks they are doing the best things in the world.
- [INTERPRETER]

134
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:05,260
- Everyone thinks they are the chosen ones of God.
- [INTERPRETER]

135
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,560
Jews thinks they are chosen ones, Muslims thinks they are chosen ones, the Christians think they are chosen ones

136
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:20,180
[INTERPRETER]

137
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:26,280
- These brands are not going to help anyone.
- [INTERPRETER]

138
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:31,900
- In the Bible, in the second verse of second chapter of Mathews,

139
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,340
Christ has clearly said, "You'll be calling Me, 'Christ, Christ,' I won't recognize you."

140
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:45,340
[INTERPRETER]

141
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,400
What is written between the lines is that, just by calling yourself that you are a follower of

142
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:59,480
this one and a follower of that and a follower of that, doesn't give you the right

143
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,880
to establish yourself as a religious person.

144
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:11,120
[INTERPRETER]

145
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,860
[INTERPRETER]

146
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:25,580
- A religious person has a religion within himself
- [INTERPRETER]

147
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:34,980
- who has no temptations,
- [INTERPRETER]
- who has no weaknesses,
- [INTERPRETER]

148
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:41,460
- who doesn't consider money that important,
- [INTERPRETER]

149
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:48,900
- who is love and compassion and generosity,
- [INTERPRETER]

150
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,780
- who is peace [UNCLEAR]
- [INTERPRETER]
- Such a person

151
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,440
has the whole personality which is so auspicious.

152
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:09,600
- [INTERPRETER]
- Auspiciousness is a coefficience

153
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:18,240
- [INTERPRETER]
- which emits the rays of Divinity all around

154
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:25,840
- [INTERPRETER]
- and such a person wherever he goes or wherever he moves,

155
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:33,420
- he spreads auspiciousness.
-  [INTERPRETER]

156
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,300
- Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

157
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,000
- [INTERPRETER]

158
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:51,160
- How many Christians we'll find who don't have adulterous eyes?
- [INTERPRETER]

159
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,680
- It's a very subtle thing Christ has said.
- [INTERPRETER]

160
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,740
The eyes of a rich person has to be innocent,

161
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,660
- [INTERPRETER]
- devoid of lust and greed.

162
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,320
- [INTERPRETER]

163
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:21,260
- He doesn't profess any religion whatsoever but He's religious
- [INTERPRETER]

164
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:28,680
and the eyes are so innocent that when such a person even looks at someone,

165
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,280
[INTERPRETER]

166
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:41,280
- he can bestow benevolence of that person.
-  [INTERPRETER]

167
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:49,540
This should happen then we can say that there is a person who has religion

168
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,740
built in his Central Nervous System - in his whole being.

169
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:02,060
[INTERPRETER]

170
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,600
- But everybody can be in religion.
- [INTERPRETER]

171
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:17,520
Everybody can get to that state where he can

172
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,440
judge on an Absolute level.

173
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,700
[INTERPRETER]

174
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,740
- We live in the world of relativity
- [INTERPRETER]

175
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:41,140
- but then we start living in the world of Absolute.
- [INTERPRETER]

176
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:48,540
Now somebody looks a very good person, he knows how to play flute, maybe or he's trying to be

177
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:56,540
- very nice and good outwardly, he can make gestures like a saint - how are you to make out?

178
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:03,380
[INTERPRETER]

179
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,680
[INTERPRETER]

180
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:13,580
- There's a way.
- [INTERPRETER]
- When you're enlightened, then from your hands

181
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,760
- the vibrations of cool breeze flow.

182
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:25,140
[INTERPRETER]

183
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:33,580
- You can feel on these finger-tips
-  [INTERPRETER]
- the centers.
-  [INTERPRETER]

184
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,140
- of another person
- [INTERPRETER]
- and if,

185
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,240
- supposing somebody has cancer
-  [INTERPRETER]

186
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:54,080
- you can feel that person on your finger-tips.
- [INTERPRETER]

187
00:20:54,540 --> 00:21:01,200
If you know how just to put the centers alright, you cure the person.

188
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,080
- [INTERPRETER]

189
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:13,360
- So you jump into a new awareness
-  [INTERPRETER]

190
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,740
- higher than the human awareness - much higher -
- [INTERPRETER]

191
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:26,380
- of collective consciousness.
- [INTERPRETER]
- That you can feel others

192
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,000
- [INTERPRETER]
- and you can feel yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]

193
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,320
- But there are people who are still very limited and stupid.
- [INTERPRETER]

194
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:47,900
They identify themselves with some sort of an idea and get stuck with it

195
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,160
-  [INTERPRETER]

196
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,480
- but if you are an open-minded person,
- [INTERPRETER]

197
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:08,900
- I have to tell you the good news
-  [INTERPRETER]
- that all such people

198
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:15,940
-  [INTERPRETER]
- can become enlightened.
-  [INTERPRETER]

199
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:24,000
- You have to have purity of intelligence.
-  [INTERPRETER]

200
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,840
It's not brilliance that dazzles others or gives big lectures and all that

201
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,320
[INTERPRETER]

202
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:39,300
but pure intelligence means that sees directly the Truth

203
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:45,400
- [INTERPRETER]
- which is not

204
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,640
maligned or spoiled by ideologies

205
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:57,560
-  [INTERPRETER]
- and theories.
-  [INTERPRETER]

206
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:04,540
- The intelligence which is so loud
-  [INTERPRETER]

207
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,060
- or is a slave
-  [INTERPRETER]
- of other's domination
-  [INTERPRETER]

208
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:16,600
- cannot be pure intelligence.
- [INTERPRETER]

209
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,360
But today, as people are getting disillusioned

210
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:28,180
- [INTERPRETER]
- many honest and sincere people

211
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,740
-  [INTERPRETER]
- are there, seeking the Truth.

212
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,060
- [INTERPRETER]
- And if you're honest

213
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,360
in your seeking, you will have to have it.

214
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:51,060
- [INTERPRETER]
- That is your right 
- [INTERPRETER]

215
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,360
- that you have to get.
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Then you'll be surprised

216
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,180
that you'll transcend all limitations of the world.

217
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:07,540
[INTERPRETER]

218
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:16,180
- You won't have all these ideas which make you small;
-  [INTERPRETER]

219
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,480
- Like a drop becomes the ocean,
- [INTERPRETER]

220
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,780
that's how your personality becomes very great.

221
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,080
- [INTERPRETER]

222
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,620
I'm very fortunate that I'm born at a time when this special work has to be done.

223
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,340
- [INTERPRETER]

224
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,720
Is mentioned in one of our old texts that, at the time when there will be

225
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,600
ghor Kaliyuga - means the worst time in the modern times -

226
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,740
-  [INTERPRETER]

227
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:06,860
- those people who are seeking the Truth
-  [INTERPRETER]
- in the jungles
-  [INTERPRETER]

228
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,480
- and in the Himalayas,
- [INTERPRETER]

229
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:19,780
- will find the Truth - their Kundalini will be awakened.
-  [INTERPRETER]

230
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,740
- And today that time has come.
-  [INTERPRETER]

231
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,500
You have been already explained about this - the knowledge of

232
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:41,000
-  the roots, the Spirit.
-  [INTERPRETER]

233
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,660
The Spirit is the Truth.

234
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:56,180
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Truth is the love -
-  [INTERPRETER]
- the pure love,

235
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:04,500
-  [INTERPRETER]
- the All-Pervading love
- [INTERPRETER]
- and that you know through your Central Nervous System -

236
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:12,840
-  [INTERPRETER]
- not just by reading something
-  [INTERPRETER]

237
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:21,260
- but as you see the flowers,
-  [INTERPRETER]
- in the same way you know the Truth.

238
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,820
- [INTERPRETER]
- The another thing is,

239
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,500
in the Nature of Spirit, it is the attention.

240
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:43,520
-  [INTERPRETER]
- That means the, when the Spirit enters into our attention,

241
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:52,080
- [INTERPRETER]
- our attention becomes enlightened.
- [INTERPRETER]

242
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:58,400
Sitting down here we can find out about anyone in the whole world.

243
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:05,920
-  [INTERPRETER]
- She's asking, "Why getting human-beings [UNCLEAR] does it [UNCLEAR] their significance?"

244
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,120
- the meaning why they get it?

245
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,680
I was about to tell you today but he told Me that he's already talked about it, so I'll just now tell you.

246
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:22,020
[INTERPRETER]

247
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,400
- [INTERPRETER]
- but I'll tell you in short.

248
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,460
- Now here you see - just push forward everybody cannot see -

249
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,420
- [UNCLEAR]
- [INTERPRETER]

250
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:45,580
- What's she saying?
- She was asking, why the question is not answered - it will just start
- Annh?

251
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,620
[LAUGHTER]

252
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:58,240
- Now, this is what you are inside - let's see.
-  [INTERPRETER]

253
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:06,680
Now, on the left-hand side you see a blue line which is, what we call, is the

254
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,260
Moon channel or you can say the Left Sympathetic Nervous System.This channel gives

255
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:19,840
- energy to the Left Sympathetic Nervous System.
- [INTERPRETER]

256
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:27,320
- [INTERPRETER]
- and the another one is the right side one, which is

257
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:33,060
- yellow colored, goes up there and like a bile color it is,

258
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:41,660
-  [INTERPRETER]
- is called as the

259
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:49,260
- Sun line or Surya Naadi, which gives rise to the Right Sympathetic System.
- [INTERPRETER]

260
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:55,000
Now, the central one is the one what we call as the

261
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:02,980
Sushumna - is the central path of ascent - which is actually gives, gives,

262
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,500
I mean, nourishes the Para-sympathetic Nervous system.

263
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:16,120
[INTERPRETER]

264
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,040
Now, in a human-being, out of his freedom

265
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,240
he can either go to any extreme of left or right.

266
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,080
[INTERPRETER]

267
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,440
[INTERPRETER]

268
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:42,500
Supposing, he is over-active and futuristic and thinks too much and works too much

269
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:50,160
and physically, all the time, working out like jogging, this, that, all sorts of things,

270
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:57,520
[INTERPRETER]

271
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:03,620
- then he goes to the right side too much
-  [INTERPRETER]
- because he's futuristic,

272
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:10,600
-  [INTERPRETER]
- his feeling
-  [INTERPRETER]

273
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:18,860
- or he may be successful
- [INTERPRETER]
- and but he develops a tremendous thing called ego.

274
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:26,020
- [INTERPRETER]
- Ego is there that, 'I'm doing this and I'm doing that.'

275
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:32,740
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Actually, we're doing nothing.

276
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:38,800
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Whatever is dead we convert it;

277
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,420
Say the wood is dead, we make the roof - we think we make something great.

278
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,520
[INTERPRETER]

279
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,220
[INTERPRETER]

280
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,580
- From dead to another dead
-  [INTERPRETER]

281
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,820
- or from whatever is dead matter, we try to discover something out of that
-  [INTERPRETER]

282
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:10,860
- and you use the energy of that
- [INTERPRETER]

283
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:17,460
but we cannot even create one little atom.

284
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,920
[INTERPRETER]

285
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:30,020
- This is the situation
- [INTERPRETER]
- but we think we're doing this, we're doing that.

286
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:38,100
- [INTERPRETER]
- As we give stories of some Indian villagers going by plane -

287
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:45,140
- were told not to take too much luggage
- [INTERPRETER]

288
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,220
- [INTERPRETER]
- because the plane will feel heavy

289
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:57,300
- [INTERPRETER]
- so they took all the luggage in the plane but put it on their heads.

290
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,820
[LAUGHTER] [INTERPRETER]

291
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,600
They were asked, "Why do you do?" They said, "We're trying to reduce the weight of the plane."

292
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:13,860
[INTERPRETER]

293
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:19,920
- In the same way, we have our ego, we think that way.
- [INTERPRETER]

294
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:27,380
Now this over-activity on the right hand side - ego - harms others -

295
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:35,840
- [INTERPRETER]
- doesn't harm you
- [INTERPRETER]

296
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:43,700
- but physically can give you tremendous effects.
- [INTERPRETER]

297
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,880
First of all, as you see, it starts with that yellow second center, called as Swadhishthana,

298
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:57,940
-  [INTERPRETER]
- which is responsible, which is very much responsible

299
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:04,840
- for all kinds of physical and mental activities;
-  [INTERPRETER]

300
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:11,780
In the sense that it converts the fat cells of the stomach for the use of the brain

301
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,700
[INTERPRETER]

302
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,100
to replace the grey - there are cells - when we think too much.

303
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,960
[INTERPRETER]

304
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:31,740
So when we think too much, this poor chakra cannot look after other functions.

305
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:39,040
[INTERPRETER]

306
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:45,980
Another important work it has got, the liver, the pancreas, the spleen,

307
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,260
the kidney and with your intestines,

308
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:56,320
[INTERPRETER]

309
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:04,520
- [INTERPRETER]
- the large intestine, the descending colon of the large intestine, they say.

310
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,760
[INTERPRETER]

311
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:14,320
Now, when these things are neglected, the first thing you get is tremendous heat in the body.

312
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:21,060
- [INTERPRETER]
- Tremendous heat

313
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:26,080
because the liver is over-active

314
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:33,060
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then we see heat passes

315
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,960
to higher side and one gets uh.. asthma

316
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,720
-  [INTERPRETER]
- because it melts the phlegm

317
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,580
- It melts the phlegm, phlegm. Doctor, what do you say to the phlegm?

318
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:58,680
- Can't get, ment?
- [INTERPRETER]

319
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:05,120
As a result of that, you get hay fever, you get sneezing,

320
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:11,680
- you get running nose and you get asthma.
- [INTERPRETER]

321
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,960
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Of course, in the medicine, they don't say this.

322
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:25,480
-   [INTERPRETER]
- They only treat the symptoms - I'm telling you the root cause.

323
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,620
[INTERPRETER]

324
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:35,200
Now, then on the other side, is the - you have got the pancreas.

325
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:41,160
- [INTERPRETER]
- The pancreas becomes over-active

326
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:47,740
- [INTERPRETER]
- so you develop diabetes.
-  [INTERPRETER]

327
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,340
You'll be amazed, that in India, in a village, people take so much sugar

328
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,280
that they say,  that the spoon must stand in the sugar.

329
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,600
[INTERPRETER]

330
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:10,200
- Nobody gets diabetes
- [INTERPRETER]
- but if you think too much

331
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,520
all the energy is spent in thinking - you get diabetes; Specially

332
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,840
people who sit down and plan, plan, plan.

333
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:27,180
[INTERPRETER]

334
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,900
Then you have the third problem, which is more serious,

335
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,100
-  [INTERPRETER]
- is the spleen

336
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:42,500
which is like a speedometer, which keeps the rhythm of life with us.

337
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:51,800
- Speedome...
-  [INTERPRETER]

338
00:36:52,140 --> 00:37:00,100
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Now, the way we, our life is, what the life is - we invite shocks.

339
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:08,680
- [INTERPRETER]
- Early in the morning, we see the newspaper.

340
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:15,060
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Finished. Horrible news, horrible things.

341
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:23,160
- This one fighting, that one killing that - all horrible things.
-  [INTERPRETER]

342
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:28,580
This poor spleen has to produce more Red blood corpuscles

343
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:37,180
- [INTERPRETER]
- for emergency.
- [INTERPRETER]
- So under shock it starts producing more RBC's

344
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:45,460
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Then you eat your food in a hurry,  your breakfast you push it in the mouth, somehow

345
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:50,780
- [INTERPRETER]
- because all the time you wasted in newspaper reading

346
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,120
-  [INTERPRETER]
- so you have no time to have  your breakfast.

347
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:03,240
- [INTERPRETER]
- You get into the car and then you find a jam - finished.

348
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:10,160
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then you're breaking your head with worrying.

349
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:16,660
- [INTERPRETER]
- Again another shock to poor spleen.
- [INTERPRETER]

350
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:24,320
It goes on producing RBC's without any rhythm in it - it becomes hectic.

351
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:29,880
- [INTERPRETER]
- It is such a hectic life you lead

352
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:38,020
- [INTERPRETER]
- Formerly, in the times of My father, I remember, My father used to come

353
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:45,560
for, get up very early, go for his film and have his breakfast on the table

354
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:50,540
and My mother would be fanning him and he would eat with that rhythm.

355
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,740
[INTERPRETER]

356
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,880
My mother used to give him that rhythm - I used to feel.

357
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:09,260
[INTERPRETER]

358
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:15,400
- [INTERPRETER]
- but nowadays you're so very hectic,

359
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:22,180
- [INTERPRETER]
- slaves of our watch,
- [INTERPRETER]

360
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:28,600
- every time trying to reach in time.
- [INTERPRETER]

361
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,500
I've known people, if you just tell them that, "I have to go to the airport," they go crazy.

362
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:42,360
- [INTERPRETER]
- "I have to go not you," but still they're crazy.

363
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,600
[INTERPRETER]

364
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,160
And they'll go on telling, "Now time go." "I am going but why are you worried, I am going you are not going."

365
00:39:52,540 --> 00:40:00,040
[INTERPRETER]

366
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:06,440
This kind of behaviour spoils the rhythm of our being.

367
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,840
[INTERPRETER]

368
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:20,220
Then is the big problem; The vulnerability is established

369
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:24,800
in the spleen and you get blood cancer.

370
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:33,040
[INTERPRETER]

371
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,460
But the cancer is pathological - it comes from the left side;

372
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,740
[INTERPRETER]

373
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:48,800
In the sense, it is triggered by the left side by some proteins.

374
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,500
[INTERPRETER]

375
00:40:54,020 --> 00:41:02,020
- But the vulnerability can come from the right side or from the left side.
- [INTERPRETER]

376
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,120
Now, if you go too much to the left also, there are problems like that.

377
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:15,240
- [INTERPRETER]
- I must have given, at least, hundred lectures on this.

378
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,780
You can get My tapes and find for yourself

379
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,180
[INTERPRETER]

380
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,560
- in all details.
- [INTERPRETER]

381
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:35,120
But in this short time, I think, I have already told you not to have a futuristic mind.

382
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:41,560
[INTERPRETER]

383
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,640
- Try to be in the present.
- [INTERPRETER]

384
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,540
Not only it is happening in our everyday life

385
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,020
but also in religious life I've seen it happens.

386
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,960
[INTERPRETER]

387
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:07,620
When Shri Rama came on this earth, they said, "We believe only in Parshurama," because he's dead now - finished.

388
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,540
- If he's dead, it's better to believe a person who's dead.
- [INTERPRETER]

389
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,380
[INTERPRETER]

390
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:23,140
Then Shri Krishna came, they said, "We don't believe in you. We believe in Shri Rama," because He's dead.

391
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:30,760
[INTERPRETER]

392
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:36,460
- They never want to believe in something that is living today
- [INTERPRETER]

393
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:44,540
- from where you can gain.
- [INTERPRETER]
- They want to believe in something that is dead and finished

394
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:50,920
- [INTERPRETER]
- because you can keep such a person in the pocket.

395
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,400
- [INTERPRETER]
- Nobody is going to ask you.

396
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,820
If Christ is not living, He's not going to say, "Why did you do this wrong?"

397
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,280
[INTERPRETER]

398
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,140
So, people don't want to take anything in the present but present is the Truth.

399
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:15,700
[INTERPRETER]

400
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,980
The past is finished and the future doesn't exist, so why not get it in the present moment.

401
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:28,080
[INTERPRETER]

402
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,820
Because we cannot live in the present moment with the temperant life, we get into troubles -

403
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:42,460
physical, mental, emotional, uh.. material, economic, political - all kinds.

404
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:50,600
[INTERPRETER]

405
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:59,920
- So, how to come to the center?
- [INTERPRETER]
- The Kundalini

406
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:08,120
goes through your centers and brings you in one line.

407
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:14,520
- [INTERPRETER]

408
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,760
- She integrates you
- [INTERPRETER]
- but this knowledge is difficult to digest.

409
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:27,000
- [INTERPRETER]
- One of the reasons is, I'm living.

410
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:34,240
- [INTERPRETER]
- When I will be dead, then you might build temples for Me.

411
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:41,620
- [INTERPRETER]
- But just now in your time, I'm telling you

412
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,900
- then you won't accept,
- [INTERPRETER]

413
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:54,100
- you won't try to understand and learn.
- [INTERPRETER]

414
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,580
- This is human nature
-  [INTERPRETER]

415
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:07,480
and this is the reason why all the people, who came on this earth, could not give realization to anyone of them.

416
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:13,780
[INTERPRETER]

417
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:19,380
Even the Christ disciples felt the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost when He was dead.

418
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,080
[INTERPRETER]

419
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,440
- Till the end they were doubting Him.
- [INTERPRETER]

420
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:35,940
- They were doubting His Immaculate conception.
-  [INTERPRETER]

421
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:44,220
- God is miraculous.
- [INTERPRETER]

422
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:51,620
- You have to see those miracles after sahaja yoga.
-  [INTERPRETER]

423
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:56,940
- One after another - you'll be amazed.
- [INTERPRETER]

424
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:03,380
- But one has to rise to that awareness.
- [INTERPRETER]

425
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:10,700
Now, one of them I told you one side but the another side is weakened, becomes Schizophrenic man

426
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:17,660
[INTERPRETER]

427
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:24,300
- and all the pathological problems
- [INTERPRETER]
- come from the left side.
- [INTERPRETER]

428
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:34,300
I think, this has taken too much time, this answering so I claim, I cannot answer.

429
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,660
[INTERPRETER]

430
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:51,640
[GERMAN?]

431
00:46:53,760 --> 00:47:01,680
[GERMAN?]

432
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:08,420
[GERMAN?]

433
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,340
[GERMAN?]

434
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,280
[GERMAN?]

435
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:26,180
- [UNCLEAR]
- Shri Krishna, Shree Mataji is the One.
- [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]

436
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:33,760
You should have written them down and I had said that, if you give Me the questions, I will answer them

437
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:41,440
when I have to speak but nobody gave Me any questions - I didn't know what to answer; Yesterday I said so.

438
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,220
- Now there is not so much time, Sir but let's see what is
- There are three questions.

439
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:54,880
[SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] You tell him that yesterday I had said, that if you have any questions,

440
00:47:55,100 --> 00:48:01,240
then you write them down and then hand it over to Me and then in My speech, I will answer them.

441
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:06,780
Now, you see the time is up and again their Nabhi, their

442
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:10,500
spleen will become hectic.

443
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:16,420
[INTERPRETER]

444
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,840
[INTERPRETER]

445
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:27,560
Now, I will be very happy if you could write down those questions for Me and I'll answer them; I promise you.

446
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,540
[INTERPRETER]

447
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,140
But all the people are now anxious to have their realization.

448
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:43,020
[INTERPRETER]

449
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:51,000
[GERMAN]

450
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:59,160
He's saying Shree Mataji, he's saying that You said, "We have time for questions."

451
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,460
But up to a point. I cannot go on the whole night, Sir.

452
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:12,840
Because they never ask any questions, though there's nothing to fight. There isn't so much time. Please be seated. I'll answer all your questions.

453
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,680
Please. I told yesterday that you give all your questions.

454
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:25,180
You should have given Me all your questions when I arrived but no questions till I said, "Alright, let's have one or two questions."

455
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,940
Alright? Please be seated. I agree with you, I should have answered but

456
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:36,200
you have three questions and I'll answer all of them, so now be satisfied, please be seated - thank you.

457
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,780
[INTERPRETER]

458
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:48,420
- [INTERPRETER]
- You should write it down and give it to Me.

459
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:54,660
I promise you, I'll send you a letter of answering your questions.

460
00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:01,240
[INTERPRETER]

461
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:13,660
[APPLAUSE]

462
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:21,300
So now, those who want to have their Self-realization, have to

463
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:25,600
[AUDIENCE]

464
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:33,800
[APPLAUSE]

465
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:43,240
Yes, that is what I think but he doesn't understand that, you see. Doesn't matter but we'll try if we can give him Self-realization.

466
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,540
- If it works out, very good; All his questions will be answered in any case.

467
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:54,880
- [INTERPRETER]

468
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:03,840
It doesn't happen on mental level, you see, it is something, a living process that takes place within. It's not a mental level thing.

469
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:12,640
[INTERPRETER]

470
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:20,440
One can, at the most, take you to that part or tell you but you have to have it yourself.

471
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,840
[INTERPRETER]

472
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:31,780
Now, those people who want to have realization

473
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:36,100
should sit here otherwise, I cannot force it on you.

474
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:43,220
- [INTERPRETER]
- is your sweet will.

475
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,280
[INTERPRETER]

476
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,900
It will take about ten minutes or fifteen minutes - is your sweet will -

477
00:51:53,780 --> 00:52:00,740
- [INTERPRETER]
- and those who do not want to have, should leave the hall.

478
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:09,680
[INTERPRETER]

479
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:13,680
People don't like others to look at them when they are meditating.

480
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:18,280
[INTERPRETER]

481
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:28,960
- Now those people, who are standing, can also sit here - there's room here.
- [INTERPRETER]
- There's some room here

482
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:34,100
Please be seated. Be comfortable. Please be seated - there's room here.

483
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:53,600
- Here, there is some room here.
- [INTERPRETER]

484
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,560
It's very simple, please. You have to do as we did yesterday.

485
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:23,460
But those who got realization yesterday, they will re-establish it properly

486
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:29,960
and the ones who haven't got it, will get it today, I hope.

487
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:37,160
[INTERPRETER]

488
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:43,580
[INTERPRETER]

489
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:48,120
[INTERPRETER]

490
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,560
We also have a workshop for you.

491
00:53:52,500 --> 00:54:00,080
- [INTERPRETER]
- You're not to give any money to anyone,
- [INTERPRETER]

492
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:05,680
- there's no business going on.
- [INTERPRETER]

493
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:12,100
- You can go and ask them what you want to ask
- [INTERPRETER]

494
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:19,540
- and they will work on you and explain to you.
- [INTERPRETER]

495
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:25,680
In such a short time, these Austrians have become so knowledgeable

496
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:31,460
[INTERPRETER]

497
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:38,880
- in the same way, you all could become very knowledgeable.
-  [INTERPRETER]

498
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,900
And all this knowledge is available to you because it is your own.

499
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:48,820
[INTERPRETER]

500
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,940
And the new revolution of a very peaceful type

501
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:58,140
within us, is working out in the whole humanity only.

502
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:03,500
[INTERPRETER]

503
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,260
[INTERPRETER]

504
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:12,200
- which will manifest
- [INTERPRETER]
- all over

505
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,180
- [INTERPRETER]
- and as I told you,

506
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:22,040
that the One who has created this world will not allow this world to be destroyed.

507
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:28,780
- [INTERPRETER]

508
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:38,720
Now, I have to make one humble request, is to take out the shoes, to take the help of the Mother Earth, for a while.

509
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,920
- [INTERPRETER]

510
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:51,200
Apart from that, shoes are different styles, so it's better.

511
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,260
- [INTERPRETER]

512
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,660
- Now, put both the feet on the Mother Earth
-  [INTERPRETER]

513
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:09,380
so the Mother Earth sucks in the left and right side problems within us.

514
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,380
- [INTERPRETER]

515
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:22,460
Automatically she sucks in when we start feeling the All-Pervading [power]

516
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:28,600
- [INTERPRETER]

517
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:37,320
So, the first thing that happens to you, that when the Kundalini crosses this center

518
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:41,100
you become absolutely peaceful, without thoughts.

519
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:48,360
- [INTERPRETER]

520
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,600
- You become thoughtlessly aware.
- [INTERPRETER]

521
00:56:54,620 --> 00:57:00,100
That means, at this center ego and the superego, the conditioning, is sucked in.

522
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:08,040
[INTERPRETER]

523
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:13,740
You can think, if you want to but no thoughts can invade you.

524
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:20,040
[INTERPRETER]

525
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:26,960
Then you feel the cool breeze emitting out of your own head

526
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,920
[INTERPRETER]

527
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:39,120
- which you have to feel yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]
- You have to give yourself a certificate.

528
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:43,980
[INTERPRETER]

529
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:48,940
- You have to be convinced about yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]

530
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:55,600
And then you start feeling the cool breeze, all over, in your hands

531
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,260
[INTERPRETER]

532
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:07,080
but sometimes, this center if it is not alright, you may not feel

533
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:15,420
though you may get your realization but you may not feel on your finger-tips, if this center is catching, the nerves are little dead, then you may not feel.

534
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:20,520
[INTERPRETER]

535
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:26,620
[INTERPRETER]

536
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:32,300
- [INTERPRETER]
- But with little practice, you do.

537
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,840
- [INTERPRETER]

538
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:42,900
Practise means, understanding where is the problem is and how to remove the hurdles, you get it.

539
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:49,720
- [INTERPRETER]

540
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:59,720
Now, as we are going to use our left hand to express our power of desire, like this on your lap

541
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:06,520
comfortably you have to sit but little straight - not like this or like that but straight

542
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:14,760
- [INTERPRETER]

543
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:19,460
- [INTERPRETER]

544
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:27,480
and the, and the, if there's anything tight, the waist or in the  neck or anything, you can loosen it.

545
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:33,560
- [INTERPRETER]

546
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:39,600
- In short, you should be comfortable.
- [INTERPRETER]

547
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:47,080
The right hand should be used for nourishing or

548
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,960
helping the Kundalini, by putting on different chakras.

549
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:59,480
[INTERPRETER]

550
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:03,800
- All of you must do it.
- [INTERPRETER]

551
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,260
- It's very simple.
- [INTERPRETER]

552
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:15,420
Now, I'll show you and then, later on, we can close the eyes and do the meditation.

553
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:23,240
[INTERPRETER]

554
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:29,760
- First we put the right hand on the heart,
- [INTERPRETER]

555
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,620
where is the reflection of the Spirit.

556
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:38,640
- [INTERPRETER]
- You can put it under the coat.
- [INTERPRETER]

557
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:46,420
- [INTERPRETER]
- It's very good; So many people have heart troubles and things -

558
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:51,180
is a very good thing to put your right hand on your heart.

559
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,980
[INTERPRETER]

560
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:02,200
Now, second

561
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:10,020
center we have to attend to, is in the upper part of the abdomen, on the left hand side.

562
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,760
[INTERPRETER]

563
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:21,420
- upper part of the abdomen on the left hand side.
- [INTERPRETER]

564
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:29,560
- This gentleman doesn't want to do it so let him go away.
- [INTERPRETER]

565
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:35,980
Please. You're already looking not well, why don't you do it?

566
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:40,660
[INTERPRETER]

567
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:47,700
- [AUDIENCE]
- He says it's his freedom
- Annh?
- It's his freedom not to do it.

568
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:55,480
- Annh?
- It's his freedom - doesn't want to do
- Yes, but here others have the freedom that they don't want you to see them;

569
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:03,080
- Let them have the freedom.
- [INTERPRETER]
- You should respect their freedom now.

570
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,680
- [INTERPRETER]
- Who likes others to watch them?

571
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:12,640
[INTERPRETER]

572
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:20,080
- [INTERPRETER]
- You have to respect their freedom.
- [INTERPRETER]

573
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:25,640
- Alright?
- Alright.

574
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:32,100
Thank you. When they close eyes, you'll have to close eyes also.

575
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:41,680
- We have no right to disturb other people.
- [INTERPRETER]

576
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:47,820
They have come for their Self-realization and they have their right to have it

577
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:54,080
[INTERPRETER]

578
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:00,060
- and it would be sinful to disturb them.
- [INTERPRETER]

579
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:05,900
- So I would request you not to disturb them.
- [INTERPRETER]

580
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:16,020
[AUDIENCE UNCLEAR]

581
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:26,100
Now, please put this right hand in the lower part of your abdomen.

582
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:31,240
[INTERPRETER]

583
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:42,540
This is the center of your Divine work.

584
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:50,000
- [INTERPRETER]
- so you have to have in your consciousness

585
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:58,660
the knowledge of the technique.

586
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:05,200
- [INTERPRETER]

587
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:10,280
Like, when I have to hold something, I know what to do with My consciousness

588
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:16,280
[INTERPRETER]

589
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:21,260
In the same way, you have to have the Pure Knowledge in your consciousness

590
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:26,100
[INTERPRETER]

591
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:32,840
- and this is the center that works it out.
- [INTERPRETER]

592
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:39,580
Then you go back on your stomach, on the left hand side of the abdomen.

593
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:45,120
[INTERPRETER]

594
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:51,440
- This is the center of your mastery.
- [INTERPRETER]

595
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:57,780
- You have to be the master -
- [INTERPRETER]
- master of yourself.

596
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:05,120
- [INTERPRETER]
- No slave of any stupidity
- [INTERPRETER]

597
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:11,160
or of any habit or any kind of temptation

598
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:18,460
[INTERPRETER]

599
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:25,440
- and you have to be the master of the knowledge.
- [INTERPRETER]

600
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:32,200
- So this is a very important center within us.
- [INTERPRETER]

601
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:41,280
- Now, put this hand back on to your heart
- [INTERPRETER]

602
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,340
- where resides the Spirit.
- [INTERPRETER]

603
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:53,880
Now, this center is very important, about which I was told, you have been informed - is the center, what we call, the Left Vishuddhi,

604
01:05:54,160 --> 01:06:00,540
on the left hand side, here - between the neck and this shoulder - in this corner.

605
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:08,540
To push the hand that side and turn your head to your right and push your hand, as much as you can, on the back side.

606
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:14,940
[INTERPRETER]

607
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:21,140
[INTERPRETER]

608
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:27,360
Now, this center is caught up when you have a guilt or you think, "I'm guilty."

609
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,120
[INTERPRETER]

610
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,700
- Nobody has to feel guilty at all,
- [INTERPRETER]

611
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:40,840
- nobody has to feel diffident also.
- [INTERPRETER]

612
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:47,880
This catch gives you diseases like angina, also spondylitis.

613
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,520
This catch gives you diseases like angina and spondylitis.

614
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:00,760
[INTERPRETER]

615
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:09,300
So it's better that you put your hands here, clearly you put your head this side when we do our meditation later on, when I tell you.

616
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:15,480
[INTERPRETER]

617
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:18,740
Now, please you have to put your hand on your forehead.

618
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:25,240
- [INTERPRETER]
- Right hand, right hand
- [INTERPRETER]
- Left hand is towards Me

619
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:32,060
- [INTERPRETER]
- Right hand - now press it on both the sides
-  [INTERPRETER]

620
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:37,200
- and press it hard
- [INTERPRETER]
- Now

621
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:45,340
you have to put your hand on the back side of your head and put the load of your head slowly on to it.

622
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:53,620
[INTERPRETER]

623
01:07:54,300 --> 01:08:00,980
- Lastly, you have to stretch your hand.
- [INTERPRETER]

624
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:09,540
Stretch your hand and you will have to put your center of your hand on top of your head

625
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:16,020
in the fontanel bone area, where it was a soft bone, for your final baptism.

626
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:23,640
[INTERPRETER]

627
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:31,700
This was a soft bone in your childhood and you stretch your fingers up and press the thing down.

628
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:37,440
- Slowly move your scalp, seven times,
- [INTERPRETER]
- clockwise

629
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:42,700
[INTERPRETER]

630
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:50,240
- [INTERPRETER]
- slowly.
- [INTERPRETER]

631
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:56,000
- That's all.
- [INTERPRETER]
- This is time when we have to look to ourselves, not to others.

632
01:08:56,780 --> 01:09:01,360
[INTERPRETER]

633
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:06,220
[INTERPRETER]

634
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,300
At least keep your eyes shut because the attention has to go inside.

[INTERPRETER]

636
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:23,200
- Till I tell you, please don't open your eyes.
- [INTERPRETER]

637
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:29,280
- You have to gain something - nothing has to be gained by Me
- [INTERPRETER]

638
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:37,220
- so, be kind to yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]
- It's for your benevolence.
- [INTERPRETER]

639
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,160
Alright. So, if you put your left hand towards Me

640
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:52,580
- [INTERPRETER]
- and both the feet on the ground, straight
- [INTERPRETER]
-  and sit little straight

641
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:58,920
- [INTERPRETER]
- and close your eyes.
- [INTERPRETER]

642
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:04,400
First thing we do, is to put our right hand on our heart.

643
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:08,900
[INTERPRETER]

644
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:18,940
Here, is the Spirit so, you please ask Me a very fundamental question -

645
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:23,300
you may call Me Shree Mataji or Mother -

646
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:29,100
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this fundamental question three times.

647
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:36,180
[INTERPRETER]

648
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:41,640
[INTERPRETER]

649
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,480
[Aside - You may turn it little bit, too much]. Now,

650
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,380
Please put your right hand

651
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,940
on the upper part of your abdomen, on the left hand side, please.

652
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:28,940
[INTERPRETER]

653
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:42,200
- Now here, is a very important center
- [INTERPRETER]

654
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:50,020
and you have to ask Me a very fundamental question, which is followed by the first one.

655
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:56,700
[INTERPRETER]

656
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:02,400
If you are your Spirit, you are your master too

657
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:06,720
[INTERPRETER]

658
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:11,680
so, please ask Me a question

659
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:18,260
"Mother, am I my own master," ask this question, three times, please.

660
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:24,120
[INTERPRETER]

661
01:12:52,360 --> 01:13:00,060
Now, please hold your right hand in the lower part of your abdomen,

662
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,840
on the left hand side - keep the left hand towards Me.

663
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:09,780
[INTERPRETER]

664
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:14,040
[INTERPRETER]

665
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:21,980
- This is the center of pure knowledge
- [INTERPRETER]

666
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:28,760
- but I cannot force on you.
- [INTERPRETER]
- In your freedom you have to ask for it

667
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:35,120
- [INTERPRETER]
- so, please ask six times,

668
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,920
"Mother, may I have the pure knowledge?

669
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:45,840
- [INTERPRETER]

670
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:50,880
Six times because this center has got six petals.

671
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:55,040
- [INTERPRETER]

672
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:17,600
By asking this question, the Kundalini has started, uh..She is awakened.

673
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:22,460
- [INTERPRETER]

674
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:30,580
To help Her cross all the centers properly, you put your right hand

675
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:35,300
on the left hand side of your stomach, in the upper part

676
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:42,520
- [INTERPRETER]

677
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:48,480
- [INTERPRETER]
- Here, with full confidence,

678
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:54,820
please say ten times, "Mother, I am my own master,

679
01:14:55,080 --> 01:15:02,480
I am my own guru, I am my guide," say this ten times.

680
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:08,140
[INTERPRETER]

681
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:11,820
[INTERPRETER]

682
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:47,560
Now, raise your hand on your heart

683
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:55,660
- [INTERPRETER]
- and here, we have to see the greatest truth

684
01:15:56,580 --> 01:16:03,060
- [INTERPRETER]
- so now, with full confidence in yourself

685
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:09,280
please say, "Mother, I am the Spirit." Please say twelve times.

686
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:15,920
[INTERPRETER]

687
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:49,880
Now, we have to know that the Divine is the ocean and love,

688
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:53,760
ocean of love and Grace

689
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:59,440
[INTERPRETER]

690
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:04,100
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness

691
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:09,280
[INTERPRETER]

692
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:16,920
and whatever mistakes you commit, is capable of completely neutralizing it.

693
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:23,940
[INTERPRETER]

694
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:28,800
So, have faith in the power of forgiveness of the Divine.

695
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:32,440
[INTERPRETER]

696
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:39,700
So, raise your right hand in the corner

697
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:46,080
of your shoulder and your neck and place your right hand,

698
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:53,140
- head towards the right.
- [INTERPRETER]

699
01:17:54,260 --> 01:18:01,700
- [INTERPRETER]
- Now here, forgive yourself
- [INTERPRETER]
- and say,

700
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:08,200
"Mother, I am not guilty at all," sixteen times.

701
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:13,520
[INTERPRETER]

702
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:20,260
Now, if you still feel guilty, then better punish yourself by saying 108 times.

703
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:28,100
[INTERPRETER]

704
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:33,920
- You should be pleasantly placed towards yourself
- [INTERPRETER]

705
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:40,080
- because you're entering into the kingdom of God.
- [INTERPRETER]

706
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:46,260
So now, say it sixteen times, "I am not at all guilty."

707
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:50,120
[INTERPRETER]

708
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:59,160
Now, raise your right hand to your forehead, across.

709
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,380
- [INTERPRETER]
- Put your left hand towards Me.

710
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:11,240
- [INTERPRETER]
- Now, press on both the sides.

711
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:19,560
- [INTERPRETER]
- On this center you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

712
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:24,520
- [INTERPRETER]

713
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:29,860
- Now, some people think, it's difficult
- [INTERPRETER]

714
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:35,760
- but it is a myth, whether you forgive or don't forgive
- [INTERPRETER]

715
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:40,800
but if you do not forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

716
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:45,840
[INTERPRETER]

717
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:49,580
- So, from your heart you have to say, not how many times,

718
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:54,080
[INTERPRETER]

719
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:59,040
- "I forgive everyone."
- [INTERPRETER]

720
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:05,460
- Now, take your hand on your back side
-  [INTERPRETER]

721
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:12,320
and put your head on that and put the load of your head, slowly,

722
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:17,120
[INTERPRETER]

723
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:24,260
Here, for your own satisfaction, you have to say, "O Divine,

724
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:32,420
if I've done any mistakes, please forgive me," but only for your satisfaction, not to feel guilty or counting your mistakes.

725
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:41,060
[INTERPRETER]

726
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:50,660
- Now, please stretch your hand, right hand
- [INTERPRETER]

727
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:58,940
- left hand towards Me
- [INTERPRETER]
- and both the feet on the Mother Earth.
- [INTERPRETER]

728
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:04,320
Now, put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area.

[INTERPRETER]

730
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:17,900
- Now, press it hard
- [INTERPRETER]
- and you have to move it seven times, slowly, clockwise,

731
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:25,400
-  [INTERPRETER]
- Here also I cannot force you

732
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:32,040
so you have to say seven times, "Mother, please give me my realization."

733
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:39,600
[INTERPRETER]

734
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:47,660
- If you like, you can bend your head a little - it will make it easier
- [INTERPRETER]

735
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:54,540
