1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:17,930
I welcome all of you from abroad, and this
Kolhapur is regarded as one of the deities’

2
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:38,370
temple, which have three-and-a-half deities,
or you can say three-and-a-half coils of the

3
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:54,920
Kundalini, so it is said that, in this triangular
bone of Maharashtra - because it is surrounded

4
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:03,731
by, on all three sides by mountains, and the
plateau is in the center so the all the three

5
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:07,120
sides make a nice triangle - is the Kundalini
of the whole universe, of the whole world,

6
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,479
is expressed by Mother Earth in Maharashtra.

7
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,850
These are three-and-a-half energies, which
are coiled together.

8
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,390
The first one is of Mahakali.

9
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,810
This Mahakali power is expressed in Tuljapur
as Bhavani, and Shivaji Maharaj used to come

10
00:01:18,810 --> 00:02:07,270
on a horse all the way for miles together,
to get the darshan of this Bhavani at Tuljapur:

11
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:22,350
he knew this; and he had a sword which was
called as Bhavani talwar, and people said

12
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:30,790
that the Goddess Herself has given this sword
to him.

13
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:44,910
Now the second one is Mahasaraswati, is at
Mahurgadh.

14
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:59,930
We always sing Mahurgadawari song, that is
the one is Mahasaraswati, which is also called

15
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:06,730
as Renuka Devi, that’s the right-sided Mahasaraswati.

16
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:21,860
Then the third one is Mahalakshmi, that is
at Kolhapur.

17
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:37,260
Here a very bad demon called Kolasur was killed
by the Mother, so this place is specially

18
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:54,070
very holy for all of us; because you got your
Realization as the Kundalini went through

19
00:03:54,070 --> 00:04:02,960
your Sushumna nadi, which is being nourished
by Mahalakshmi principle.

20
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:22,060
So in the Temple they sit down - it’s a
Mahalakshmi’s Temple, but they sing that:

21
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:31,810
“Oh Ambe, please rise, please rise, please
rise.”

22
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:40,990
This comes with the full understanding of
the Sushumna nadi, but ninety-nine-point-nine

23
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:51,199
percent people don’t know, because all the
knowledge about Shakti is being lost due to

24
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,770
the different timings, and people never worried
about it.

25
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:11,710
So, one has to realize that in Indian shastras,
scriptures, Shakti is the most important thing.

26
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:32,039
It is to be understood why: because, say now,
if you have a light or if you have fire, what

27
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,840
is the power of fire?

28
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:51,610
The power of fire can be that it can give
you light, it can burn away things, but supposing

29
00:05:51,610 --> 00:06:01,310
it does not have its power, then who’ll
care for fire?

30
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,310
Nothing.

31
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:15,740
So anybody who hasn’t got the power of being
the Spirit, it is useless.

32
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:29,020
So this power, this Shakti, has to be awakened
within us, because we do not have the power

33
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,280
of the Spirit.

34
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:38,509
We have to have the power of the Spirit.

35
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:46,379
That’s only possible if you get your Self
Realization.

36
00:06:46,379 --> 00:07:02,370
That is the reason it is very important that
we should pay attention to our power.

37
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:23,199
Now this power is made as the power of a Mother.

38
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:38,530
Mother is the most loving relationship, and
through that relationship all the love is

39
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,669
expressed.

40
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:58,479
That is why the Shakti is that of a Mother,
and the affection, the love, the patience

41
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:31,520
that Mother has for Her children, the Shakti
too has the same powers, you see, and that

42
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:40,539
is how this Shakti never can harm you.

43
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:57,470
Out of all these Shaktis, all these powers,
highest of all is what we call as the Kundalini,

44
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:04,519
because without Her you cannot get Realization.

45
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:18,480
But also we can say, higher than that, or
complementary to that, is Mahalakshmi power.

46
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Without the Mahalakshmi you cannot rise.

47
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,519
This is the ladder through which this power
of Kundalini can rise.

48
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:39,490
So both the powers are very important and
very much related to each other.

49
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:49,690
Mahalakshmi principle starts when we have
finished with Lakshmi principle.

50
00:09:49,690 --> 00:10:18,620
Like in the West, people are fed up with affluence,
fed up with all the riches and all that, so

51
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:27,759
they are thinking: “What have we achieved?

52
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:36,720
We have gone into imbalances, so what should
we do?

53
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,000
We have to balance ourselves.”

54
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,730
So how do we balance ourselves?

55
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:49,010
We have to have the knowledge of the Spirit.

56
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:55,390
That is called as aadhyatma.

57
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:09,970
You have to know what is the knowledge of
the Spirit, and to know the knowledge of the

58
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:19,720
Spirit Kundalini has to be awakened, and that
you are to be connected to this all-pervading

59
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Power.

60
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:29,130
Once that happens, you just become one with
that energy and you get transformation within

61
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:43,199
yourself, because there is light and in the
light you can see all your problems, all your

62
00:11:43,199 --> 00:12:03,579
defects; and also if you know how to correct
it, is the easiest thing to do is to get transformation

63
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:05,560
in Sahaja Yoga.

64
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:14,480
All of you have been very much transformed,
and now I find it difficult even to recognize

65
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,600
you, because all your faces are changed, your
attitudes are changed, you look so different,

66
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,620
so beautiful.

67
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:27,180
Today it seems to be a special day for Me,
here in Mahalakshmi Temple, that Mahalakshmi

68
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:35,029
is being awakened, and I’m feeling really
in that state of thoughtless awareness.

69
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:50,370
I don’t know how I’m talking; and I am
merged just in the meditative mood, absolutely

70
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,540
into meditative mood.

71
00:12:53,540 --> 00:13:02,430
Because when you are in the center you don’t
think, you are in meditation.

72
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,089
That is why Mahalakshmi is very important.

73
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:11,860
So when you are fed up, you can feel there’s
something missing, and then you take to Mahalakshmi

74
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,860
principle.

75
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:19,069
But in India because of so many saints, we
feel that we should short-circuit it.

76
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:27,759
First let us develop our own aadhyatma, let
us develop our knowledge of atma and then

77
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:42,150
take to science, so there is no more imbalance
within us; because without the foundation

78
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:55,010
of aadhyatma, knowledge of the Spirit, you
take to any kind of progress, you can topple

79
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,010
down.

80
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,690
That’s why all the Western entrepreneurs,
enterprises and also projections of religion

81
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:10,190
have gone to waste, because there has been
no balance.

82
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:21,480
It is important that we must have the balance
within ourselves.

83
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:41,629
Now in India we have people who have this
idea, at least that you have to rise higher

84
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:58,110
than materialism and that you have to become
one with the Virata, part and parcel of the

85
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,110
whole.

86
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:12,540
This they know, and that’s what, by knowing
that, once they get to Sahaja Yoga, they grow

87
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:27,170
very deeply; the depth, the depth they have
achieved with this faith, that we have to

88
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:32,020
be self-realized, and that we have to feel
the all-pervading Power.

89
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:43,839
This conviction itself gives them the depth
and so when they achieve Realization, they

90
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,279
just go down very deep.

91
00:15:48,279 --> 00:16:01,540
But most surprising, people who have never
heard about Ganesha, who have never heard

92
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:13,880
about Kolhapur, have never heard about Mahalakshmi
are sometimes much, much better, much more

93
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:28,370
deeper than the people who know all these
things by heart.

94
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:42,339
So one can deduct that those who know outwardly,
those who know through their books, or through

95
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:47,520
some gurus who teach them something, are absolutely
outside.

96
00:16:47,520 --> 00:17:03,649
They have nothing in them to tell us because
they have had no experience of the Self, no

97
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:07,780
experience of the Self.

98
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:18,709
That’s only possible when your Kundalini
rises and breaks your Brahmarandra.

99
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:35,240
That is the time the first experience comes
to you of this all-pervading Power.

100
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:47,940
So all those people who have been only just
praying to Mahalakshmi, have been going to

101
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:59,039
Her, doing a lot of penances, fasting, this,
that, have no idea as to what Mahalakshmi

102
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:10,049
wants, and they always complain to Me: “Mother,
we have done this, we have done that.”

103
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:13,830
People are very religious.

104
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:28,630
They are doing all kinds of ritualism, what
we call as karmakanda, but with that you do

105
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:34,910
not reach where you have to reach.

106
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:43,970
So one has to understand that whatever has
been written and told about all these great

107
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:51,740
things in India, people may know in words,
but in experience they do not know.

108
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:58,470
So Sahaja Yoga is very important to give them
this experience, so that they can really verify

109
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:09,360
whatever is said in the science of spirituality
about getting Realization, is absolutely true.

110
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:20,250
Not only that but it’s very practical, and
every person who gets Realization can understand

111
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,880
it very well.

112
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,400
So we are here in a very holy place, full
of unholy people.

113
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:37,659
But still there are some very, very good people
here also, and because of Mahalakshmi, they

114
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:45,710
make very good ornaments because these ornaments
are offered to the Goddess.

115
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:54,990
You can feel there a kind of a subdued feeling
for God, feeling for spirituality, but they

116
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:04,680
do not have the experience that you have got,
so you are much higher than all of them.

117
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,100
And those who have the experience can feel
more, once they go to the Temple, if you can

118
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:17,260
go to the Temple to see the place also; but
give yourself a big bandhan because I have

119
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,730
seen it, next to the deity there are very
funny people sitting.

120
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,020
They’re doing all kinds of commercial activities.

121
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,470
They are selling flowers, they are selling
this, selling everything.

122
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,730
So you have to be careful, with a bandhan
you can go and see for yourself.

123
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:43,370
Now they say that this Temple is made because
it’s a swayambhu – it’s the one that

124
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:51,080
has come out of Mother Earth – you can see
yourself if there are vibrations and moreover,

125
00:20:51,080 --> 00:21:01,870
you must know that this puja of these deities
are done by people who are not at all in any

126
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:09,190
way religious, but are just commercial people.

127
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:21,490
Commercialism can never give you any satisfaction,
can never give you at all any satisfaction.

128
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:30,419
Apart from that it can take you to something
unknown, of dangerous shores.

129
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:37,650
But if your faith is pure, without any greed,
without any demands, then you develop your

130
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:49,860
depth within yourself; which is very helpful
after Sahaja Yoga.

131
00:21:49,860 --> 00:22:01,210
It’s a remarkable thing how this Shri Chakra
is here and how they have made the complete

132
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,020
calculation of Shri Chakra.

133
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:10,590
I met a scientist in Russia, in Moscow, who
has done a research, very much big research

134
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,370
on this Shri Chakra.

135
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:20,549
Now, so we have Shri Chakra on the right side,
on the left-hand side we have Lalita Chakra,

136
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:28,110
so all the things that we do with hands after
Realization are worked through, on the right-hand

137
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:34,870
side Shri Chakra, on the left-hand side Lalita
Chakra.

138
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:54,490
Now how it works is a very complicated thing,
but we don’t have to worry about that.

139
00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:18,529
As soon as you put your hand on somebody,
the chakra knows how to work it out.

140
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:36,490
It works by itself, as if it is a built-in
mechanism within us, which knows what sort

141
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:53,880
of vibrations to be given to a particular
person for a particular cause, or a particular

142
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,580
purpose.

143
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:05,019
If that person has certain defects also, these
chakras know what is to be emitted, how to

144
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:07,260
work it out.

145
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:21,149
So it is not that we have the Kundalini awakening
only, these chakras are awakened, we also

146
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:29,169
have these two chakras awakened within us
because of Kundalini.

147
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:39,010
But if you have Vishuddi problem, then you
can find that your hands are stiff and you

148
00:24:39,010 --> 00:25:03,210
cannot feel guidance, or you can say, the
Divine intentions of Realization; because

149
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:15,580
when you start using your hands you don’t
feel any vibrations, so how will you know

150
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,110
what’s happening?

151
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:27,799
It’s a very complicated thing, and for that
complicated thing these instruments are made

152
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:49,940
already, are prepared already; they are quite
equipped with all the knowledge that is necessary,

153
00:25:49,940 --> 00:26:07,950
like a feedback as you call it, or we can
call it a complete programming is there.

154
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:26,769
So as soon as you put your hand on a person,
the programming starts working it out.

155
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:42,970
Because it is programming is done by God Almighty,
it can never be wrong.

156
00:26:42,970 --> 00:27:02,820
It cannot be two different things, as far
as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

157
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:22,910
I have been thinking about writing about all
these big, big peethas that are in India,

158
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:40,890
so it will be helpful to you as well as to
others in India.

159
00:27:40,890 --> 00:28:00,730
But here the atmosphere is so bad, as if to
think of God, to talk of God is absolutely

160
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,730
wrong, you cannot say.

161
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:12,870
The people are in illusion, and they think
that all these talks has brought us nothing.

162
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:29,700
To them it is the progress of the West is
more effective, more apparent, that they can

163
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:42,280
see how you have progressed in materialism,
and they can’t understand how we could progress

164
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:53,889
with aadhyatma very much in the area of physical
development or mental development.

165
00:28:53,889 --> 00:29:07,899
So now we come to a point where we realize
that it is very important for all the Western

166
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:12,960
people to have the foundation of aadhyatma.

167
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:23,600
For that it is important to give up some of
your conditionings, because this knowledge

168
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,910
is coming definitely from India.

169
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:40,960
I mean the Indians had all the knowledge of
your medical science, this science, that science,

170
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
that science.

171
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:51,260
But God’s science is in India, and for that,
what are you going to do?

172
00:29:51,260 --> 00:30:05,500
When the question of God’s science is concerned,
what are you going to do about it?

173
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:21,460
How are you going to work it out, that this
is the science of God, and the God’s science

174
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:28,770
has to be understood with full dedication
and devotion?

175
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:36,230
Because of the conditioning of the Western
influence, the Western progress, sometimes

176
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:50,630
we just do not know how to grasp this knowledge
within ourselves; very difficult.

177
00:30:50,630 --> 00:31:09,010
But if you can understand that, as for science
we had to accept it fully from the West, you

178
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:27,950
have to accept the knowledge of your Spirit
from the East, East has the knowledge of the

179
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:46,429
Spirit: for 
that you have to be ready to receive it.

180
00:31:46,429 --> 00:32:01,399
But if you are still in your arrogance, if
you are still in your own conditionings, then

181
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:05,399
you cannot do it.

182
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:18,059
Like a boy who comes from a village, who has
never known about science, and you suddenly

183
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:28,710
put him in a science college, he’ll say:
“What is this nonsense, what’s all this

184
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,710
all?

185
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:34,410
I have never known these things.

186
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:44,150
Why should I use a test tube, why should I
go in the laboratory?”

187
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:52,250
All kinds of things he can start saying, and
this conditioning is there.

188
00:32:52,250 --> 00:33:16,130
Then he’ll run away from school within one
year or two year, maybe earlier, and that

189
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:29,059
is what I find is their conditioning, which
turns away many people from Sahaja Yoga after

190
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:30,059
some time.

191
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:38,830
So we must watch our conditionings, what sort
of conditionings we have; while the Indians

192
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:47,179
have conditionings of so-called religious
beliefs and this ritualism, this, that, they

193
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:51,000
are very much conditioned also.

194
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:10,590
But is easy to overcome that when you realize
that whatever your worship: for example, in

195
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:26,579
India everybody has a kuladevata, means the
family’s goddess, everybody has; they must

196
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:31,730
worship that goddess, particular goddess,
everybody has.

197
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:45,000
So they have to, if they just ask: “Mother,
are You that Goddess?” the vibrations start

198
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,830
flowing.

199
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:59,790
So the conditioning gets very easily eradicated,
but the mental acceptance of something is

200
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,760
very difficult to go.

201
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:13,620
And I’ve seen also when they get married
or marriage is arranged, they go mental.

202
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,120
They go mental.

203
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:28,000
If you go mental, then you cannot understand
many things.

204
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:36,100
But if you are spiritual, then you can understand.

205
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:46,330
For example, we see Mother Earth giving us
these flowers and all that, how can we go

206
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,330
mental about it?

207
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,330
It’s a living process.

208
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,609
For any living process we cannot get mental.

209
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:58,390
So now you will say: “All right, this is
because of seed has got this, and the seed

210
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,390
is planted”; but how, why?

211
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,390
That you can’t answer, can never answer.

212
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,390
Then you’ll keep quiet.

213
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,390
But say if there’s a sage, he’ll say:
“All right, this is Mother Earth, She wants

214
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,390
to give to Her children, these flowers, fruits,
these trees, so She’s working it out.”

215
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,630
So one has to jump from one conditioning of
materialism.

216
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:11,030
Now you should see in matter, energy never
moves.

217
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:16,270
Energy is stationary, it never moves.

218
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:21,470
And also energies which are moving, so-called,
like electricity, this, that, are absolutely

219
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,470
blind.

220
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,470
Supposing there is electricity here flowing,
all right, well and good, but supposing somebody

221
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,730
stops it, it will stop.

222
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:34,970
It has no mind, it is a mindless thing.

223
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,380
So in materialism you become mindless.

224
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,800
You start seeing also that within yourself,
that you have become mindless; and becoming

225
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,579
absolutely, absolutely, I should say, like
robots sometimes, which is mindless, which

226
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,589
is fixed, fixed quantity.

227
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:55,990
And I see very much clearly, in the West I’ve
seen, that people have very fixed ideas.

228
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:06,980
It’s difficult for them to get out of it
because they don’t have that movement towards

229
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,790
the spiritual subtlety, where one can use
the mind to do something.

230
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,339
We would say that Mother Earth has got the
mind.

231
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:17,660
Now that nobody can believe in the West, except
for Sahaja Yogis.

232
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:22,080
That the Mother Earth produces these vigrahas,
She produces these deities, nobody will believe.

233
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,260
How can you believe such a thing, that this
Mother Earth thinks, that this Mother Earth

234
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,260
produces these things?

235
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,680
But logically you can see, logically.

236
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,680
Logically.

237
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:38,060
Say a tree has a certain height, the fruits
have a certain shape, certain colors, flowers

238
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:43,034
same: who changes all the seasons, specially
in India is very clear-cut six seasons?

239
00:37:43,034 --> 00:37:44,320
It’s called as Ritambhara pragya in the
Hatha Yoga.

240
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,770
Now that is the One which is a Lady, which
thinks.

241
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:55,890
She has a mind of Her own, She decides and
She works out everything.

242
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,660
This concept was doubly denied in the West,
is first is that they cannot accept a Goddess.

243
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,869
Woman has no part.

244
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:06,910
Right from Socrates onward, nobody has talked
much about a Woman, except of course there

245
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:16,430
is Athena and all that, but it’s very minor
roles they have.

246
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:28,940
Greeks had goddesses who were just like human
beings, so that also gets ruled out, and very

247
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,190
little was accepted; and when Christianity
came, somehow or other Christians saw to it

248
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:34,002
that there should be no mention of the Mother
in any way.

249
00:38:34,002 --> 00:38:35,350
But despite that, people worshipped the Mother.

250
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:42,956
They worshipped the Mother of Christ as, some
like a Goddess; though in the Bible She’s

251
00:38:42,956 --> 00:39:01,609
talked as a “woman”, in a very derogatory
style She’s addressed.

252
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:12,920
So the conditioning of people is about the
power of God who hangs somewhere in the air,

253
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:24,849
that He’s there and that He gives us everything;
but what is the communication?

254
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:41,140
What is the justification or what is the logical
thing, how to explain?

255
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,670
So you have to say: “It is a mystery.

256
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,569
God is a mystery.

257
00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:48,980
He hangs somewhere in the air.

258
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,040
He does everything.”

259
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,450
And how can people believe in it?

260
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:02,880
So the Christian conditioning has been even
worse than, I think, Jew conditioning because

261
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,400
they just took it out, Christ’s Mother,
away; though the painters, artists wouldn’t

262
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:14,230
do that, they wouldn’t accept: they had
the Mother there.

263
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:18,430
But despite all that, the Motherhood has not
been respected that should have been, in the

264
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:26,670
Bible, which is a very wrong thing, while
Mahalakshmi Herself incarnated as Mother Mary

265
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,670
Herself.

266
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,650
And to say about Mahalakshmi as “a woman”,
I think is a great insult.

267
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,620
And where women are insulted like this, where
the Goddesses are insulted, we cannot expect

268
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,190
any spiritual growth unless and until you
accept that it’s the Shakti, is the Motherhood,

269
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,490
who is the only thing that’s the communication
between us and the Divinity.

270
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,579
So this conditioning, Christian conditioning
has to go out, as far as the Motherhood is

271
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:41,579
concerned.

272
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:45,119
It’s very surprising sometimes when I see
how these people have tried to bring down

273
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,119
the level of a Goddess to just a woman.

274
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,119
So this is a very big blessing in India, that
they respect Mother as the Shakti, and that

275
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,119
the whole thing is done by the movement of
the Shakti, by the thinking of the Shakti,

276
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,119
by the coordination and the understanding
and the planning of the Shakti only.

277
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,119
It’s not done by God Almighty, He’s just
a spectator.

278
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:51,119
She does everything.

279
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,119
Once that concept can fit into your heads
properly, then you will see so many conditionings

280
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,450
will drop out; because religion was organized,
and in an organized religion you can put whatever

281
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,770
you like, the way you want to put it, and
it was such a big mistake.

282
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,770
By that people developed a lot of ego, lot
of things against women, and also the first

283
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:59,850
sin they call the “original sin” and all
that is because of a woman, they really ill-treated

284
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:00,850
women and they have no respect for them.

285
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,850
So the women have changed their role, and
instead of becoming mothers and goddesses,

286
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:02,850
they have tried to become something like actresses.

287
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:16,369
But you can understand that without the power
there is no sense in anything, and this is

288
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:18,641
the power of Love and this is the power of
Truth.

289
00:41:18,641 --> 00:41:19,641
And once you get that power we should humble
down, and know that this power is within us,

290
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:20,641
which has given us all this knowledge, which
has given us all this ability to raise the

291
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:21,641
Kundalini.

292
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:22,641
All this is because of energy within us, the
Shakti within us.

293
00:41:22,641 --> 00:41:23,641
Without that we are nothing.

294
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:24,641
And that too is the Mother who has done it.

295
00:41:24,641 --> 00:41:33,480
I do not know how much to press this point,
but it’s important; because I find, specially

296
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,740
in England some newspaper people came: “How
do you feel as a guru, as a woman?”

297
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,869
I mean, it’s a kind of a thing, “a woman”,
as if I am sort of a, that movement where

298
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:40,670
women are starting a fight with the men, sort
of a thing, and now: “This is another guru

299
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:45,309
who is a woman, so She should be supported,”
or some sort of a nonsense like that.

300
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:47,890
It’s the only the Mother who does this job,
so there’s no question of asking such a

301
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:48,890
question.

302
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:49,890
But that’s what it is, that we should first
know that it’s the feminine quality of a

303
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:50,890
woman as a mother, is very powerful.

304
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:51,890
But we should encourage it and try to develop
it, so that spiritually you can communicate,

305
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:52,890
spiritually you can imbibe these qualities
for your own children.

306
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:53,890
The mothers who do not have aadhyatma can
never develop good children with proper emotions,

307
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:54,890
with proper value system of morality.

308
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,890
So it is very important for every mother to
be very proud that they are mothers, and for

309
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:56,890
girls who are going to be mothers to be very
proud that they are going to be mothers, and

310
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,890
that they represent the Shakti.

311
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,688
So now then, what is the part of the men is
to take full advantage of that power, by understanding

312
00:41:59,688 --> 00:42:00,688
it, by complementing, by looking after that
power.

313
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:01,688
I’m not talking only about your wives.

314
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:02,688
I’m talking about your sisters, your daughters,
your mothers, and the whole society, where

315
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:03,688
women are to be respected, and they have to
be respectable.

316
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:07,320
And women should try to be respectable, to
try to know that they are the powers and they

317
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,690
are the ones who will be used by this Divine
power as channels, more than men.

318
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,680
But if they are useless, then of course they
wouldn’t bother about them, they would like

319
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,680
to bother then about men, much more than what
you are.

320
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,680
So it is important to understand what is your
role in Sahaja Yoga.

321
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,680
This is your role in Sahaja Yoga.

322
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,680
And I am sure you can work it out.

323
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,680
You can manage this part.

324
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,140
You can equip yourself for this role, which
is so beautiful and so good.

325
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,780
So much can be said about Mahalakshmi, and
there’s no end to it, but I think later

326
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,190
on we should keep this program on every year,
and you all should come to Mahalakshmi Temple

327
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:30,290
here, to the, I mean the Kolhapur, and then
I’ll again tell you all about the Mother’s

328
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,290
qualities, what She is as Mahalakshmi.

329
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,290
And today we’ll have the Shri Sukta.

330
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,720
Shri Sukta is about Mahalakshmi’s qualities.

331
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,170
I think we’ll have Ganesha Stuthi and then
we’ll have this.

332
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,170
So seriously you must understand what is it…

333
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:41,241
I’m just in meditative mood today, I don’t
know what I’m talking; because this Mahalakshmi

334
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:44,920
is a thing that goes, finishes everything
else.

335
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,630
Left, right is finished now, you are just
in Mahalakshmi state: what to do?

336
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,050
“Mahalakshmi state” means nirvichar, nirvikalp,
beyond that, I don’t know what stages it

337
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,050
is.

338
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,050
It comes down a little bit, then again it
goes back to the same.

339
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:50,056
