1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:10,740
I welcome all of you from abroad, and this
Kolhapur is regarded as one of the deities’

2
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:24,930
temple, which have three-and-a-half deities,
or you can say three-and-a-half coils of the

3
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:45,370
Kundalini, so it is said that, in this triangular
bone of Maharashtra - because it is surrounded

4
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,920
by, on all three sides by mountains, and the
plateau is in the center so the all the three

5
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,110
sides make a nice triangle - is the Kundalini
of the whole universe, of the whole world,

6
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,479
is expressed by Mother Earth in Maharashtra.

7
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,380
These are three-and-a-half energies, which
are coiled together. The first one is of Mahakali.

8
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,810
This Mahakali power is expressed in Tuljapur
as Bhavani, and Shivaji Maharaj used to come

9
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,810
on a horse all the way for miles together,
to get the darshan of this Bhavani at Tuljapur:

10
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:14,270
he knew this; and he had a sword which was
called as Bhavani talwar, and people said

11
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:29,350
that the Goddess Herself has given this sword
to him. Now the second one is Mahasaraswati,

12
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:47,010
is at Mahurgadh. We always sing Mahurgadawari
song, that is the one is Mahasaraswati, which

13
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,720
is also called as Renuka Devi, that’s the
right-sided Mahasaraswati. Then the third

14
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:17,510
one is Mahalakshmi, that is at Kolhapur. Here
a very bad demon called Kolasur was killed

15
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:36,750
by the Mother, so this place is specially
very holy for all of us; because you got your

16
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:57,430
Realization as the Kundalini went through
your Sushumna nadi, which is being nourished

17
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:07,110
by Mahalakshmi principle. So in the Temple
they sit down - it’s a Mahalakshmi’s Temple,

18
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:23,650
but they sing that: “Oh Ambe, please rise,
please rise, please rise.” This comes with

19
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:41,879
the full understanding of the Sushumna nadi,
but ninety-nine-point-nine percent people

20
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:48,879
don’t know, because all the knowledge about
Shakti is being lost due to the different

21
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,770
timings, and people never worried about it.

22
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:03,770
So, one has to realize that in Indian shastras,
scriptures, Shakti is the most important thing.

23
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:18,710
It is to be understood why: because, say now,
if you have a light or if you have fire, what

24
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:39,039
is the power of fire? The power of fire can
be that it can give you light, it can burn

25
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:55,080
away things, but supposing it does not have
its power, then who’ll care for fire? Nothing.

26
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:09,189
So anybody who hasn’t got the power of being
the Spirit, it is useless. So this power,

27
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:27,599
this Shakti, has to be awakened within us,
because we do not have the power of the Spirit.

28
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:37,279
We have to have the power of the Spirit. That’s
only possible if you get your Self Realization.

29
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:53,379
That is the reason it is very important that
we should pay attention to our power. Now

30
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:11,050
this power is made as the power of a Mother.
Mother is the most loving relationship, and

31
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:41,059
through that relationship all the love is
expressed. That is why the Shakti is that

32
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:53,009
of a Mother, and the affection, the love,
the patience that Mother has for Her children,

33
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:15,900
the Shakti too has the same powers, you see,
and that is how this Shakti never can harm

34
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:40,539
you.

35
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:47,539
Out of all these Shaktis, all these powers,
highest of all is what we call as the Kundalini,

36
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:04,470
because without Her you cannot get Realization.
But also we can say, higher than that, or

37
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,470
complementary to that, is Mahalakshmi power.
Without the Mahalakshmi you cannot rise. This

38
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:26,470
is the ladder through which this power of
Kundalini can rise. So both the powers are

39
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:37,310
very important and very much related to each
other. Mahalakshmi principle starts when we

40
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:49,690
have finished with Lakshmi principle.

41
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:56,690
Like in the West, people are fed up with affluence,
fed up with all the riches and all that, so

42
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:25,620
they are thinking: “What have we achieved?
We have gone into imbalances, so what should

43
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:42,810
we do? We have to balance ourselves.” So
how do we balance ourselves? We have to have

44
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:53,019
the knowledge of the Spirit. That is called
as aadhyatma. You have to know what is the

45
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:09,779
knowledge of the Spirit, and to know the knowledge
of the Spirit Kundalini has to be awakened,

46
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:19,639
and that you are to be connected to this all-pervading
Power. Once that happens, you just become

47
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:30,829
one with that energy and you get transformation
within yourself, because there is light and

48
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:40,350
in the light you can see all your problems,
all your defects; and also if you know how

49
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:57,149
to correct it, is the easiest thing to do
is to get transformation in Sahaja Yoga. All

50
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:13,220
of you have been very much transformed, and
now I find it difficult even to recognize

51
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,600
you, because all your faces are changed, your
attitudes are changed, you look so different,

52
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,620
so beautiful.

53
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:27,180
Today it seems to be a special day for Me,
here in Mahalakshmi Temple, that Mahalakshmi

54
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:34,180
is being awakened, and I’m feeling really
in that state of thoughtless awareness. I

55
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:43,019
don’t know how I’m talking; and I am merged
just in the meditative mood, absolutely into

56
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:58,430
meditative mood. Because when you are in the
center you don’t think, you are in meditation.

57
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:08,620
That is why Mahalakshmi is very important.
So when you are fed up, you can feel there’s

58
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:15,620
something missing, and then you take to Mahalakshmi
principle. But in India because of so many

59
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:22,139
saints, we feel that we should short-circuit
it. First let us develop our own aadhyatma,

60
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:29,139
let us develop our knowledge of atma and then
take to science, so there is no more imbalance

61
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:44,060
within us; because without the foundation
of aadhyatma, knowledge of the Spirit, you

62
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:55,500
take to any kind of progress, you can topple
down. That’s why all the Western entrepreneurs,

63
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:05,160
enterprises and also projections of religion
have gone to waste, because there has been

64
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:15,290
no balance. It is important that we must have
the balance within ourselves.

65
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,480
Now in India we have people who have this
idea, at least that you have to rise higher

66
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:48,629
than materialism and that you have to become
one with the Virata, part and parcel of the

67
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:05,110
whole. This they know, and that’s what,
by knowing that, once they get to Sahaja Yoga,

68
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:17,930
they grow very deeply; the depth, the depth
they have achieved with this faith, that we

69
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:32,329
have to be self-realized, and that we have
to feel the all-pervading Power. This conviction

70
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:40,129
itself gives them the depth and so when they
achieve Realization, they just go down very

71
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:54,180
deep. But most surprising, people who have
never heard about Ganesha, who have never

72
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:08,110
heard about Kolhapur, have never heard about
Mahalakshmi are sometimes much, much better,

73
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:18,810
much more deeper than the people who know
all these things by heart.

74
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:35,370
So one can deduct that those who know outwardly,
those who know through their books, or through

75
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:49,339
some gurus who teach them something, are absolutely
outside. They have nothing in them to tell

76
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:56,980
us because they have had no experience of
the Self, no experience of the Self. That’s

77
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:15,770
only possible when your Kundalini rises and
breaks your Brahmarandra. That is the time

78
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:33,970
the first experience comes to you of this
all-pervading Power. So all those people who

79
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:46,210
have been only just praying to Mahalakshmi,
have been going to Her, doing a lot of penances,

80
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:58,720
fasting, this, that, have no idea as to what
Mahalakshmi wants, and they always complain

81
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:09,700
to Me: “Mother, we have done this, we have
done that.” People are very religious. They

82
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:21,770
are doing all kinds of ritualism, what we
call as karmakanda, but with that you do not

83
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:34,900
reach where you have to reach.

84
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:41,900
So one has to understand that whatever has
been written and told about all these great

85
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:50,970
things in India, people may know in words,
but in experience they do not know. So Sahaja

86
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,840
Yoga is very important to give them this experience,
so that they can really verify whatever is

87
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:06,110
said in the science of spirituality about
getting Realization, is absolutely true. Not

88
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:17,340
only that but it’s very practical, and every
person who gets Realization can understand

89
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,880
it very well.

90
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,880
So we are here in a very holy place, full
of unholy people. But still there are some

91
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,919
very, very good people here also, and because
of Mahalakshmi, they make very good ornaments

92
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:47,470
because these ornaments are offered to the
Goddess. You can feel there a kind of a subdued

93
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:58,480
feeling for God, feeling for spirituality,
but they do not have the experience that you

94
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:07,520
have got, so you are much higher than all
of them. And those who have the experience

95
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:14,919
can feel more, once they go to the Temple,
if you can go to the Temple to see the place

96
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,600
also; but give yourself a big bandhan because
I have seen it, next to the deity there are

97
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:26,110
very funny people sitting. They’re doing
all kinds of commercial activities. They are

98
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:33,110
selling flowers, they are selling this, selling
everything. So you have to be careful, with

99
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:34,730
a bandhan you can go and see for yourself.

100
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:41,730
Now they say that this Temple is made because
it’s a swayambhu – it’s the one that

101
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:50,370
has come out of Mother Earth – you can see
yourself if there are vibrations and moreover,

102
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:58,080
you must know that this puja of these deities
are done by people who are not at all in any

103
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:08,870
way religious, but are just commercial people.
Commercialism can never give you any satisfaction,

104
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:21,899
can never give you at all any satisfaction.
Apart from that it can take you to something

105
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:35,190
unknown, of dangerous shores. But if your
faith is pure, without any greed, without

106
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:42,190
any demands, then you develop your depth within
yourself; which is very helpful after Sahaja

107
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,860
Yoga.

108
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:56,860
It’s a remarkable thing how this Shri Chakra
is here and how they have made the complete

109
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:08,210
calculation of Shri Chakra. I met a scientist
in Russia, in Moscow, who has done a research,

110
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:15,799
very much big research on this Shri Chakra.
Now, so we have Shri Chakra on the right side,

111
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:23,710
on the left-hand side we have Lalita Chakra,
so all the things that we do with hands after

112
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:32,350
Realization are worked through, on the right-hand
side Shri Chakra, on the left-hand side Lalita

113
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:40,700
Chakra. Now how it works is a very complicated
thing, but we don’t have to worry about

114
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,880
that. As soon as you put your hand on somebody,
the chakra knows how to work it out. It works

115
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:27,200
by itself, as if it is a built-in mechanism
within us, which knows what sort of vibrations

116
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:44,669
to be given to a particular person for a particular
cause, or a particular purpose. If that person

117
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,880
has certain defects also, these chakras know
what is to be emitted, how to work it out.

118
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:14,260
So it is not that we have the Kundalini awakening
only, these chakras are awakened, we also

119
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:28,149
have these two chakras awakened within us
because of Kundalini. But if you have Vishuddi

120
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:40,539
problem, then you can find that your hands
are stiff and you cannot feel guidance, or

121
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:55,409
you can say, the Divine intentions of Realization;
because when you start using your hands you

122
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,720
don’t feel any vibrations, so how will you
know what’s happening? It’s a very complicated

123
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:27,159
thing, and for that complicated thing these
instruments are made already, are prepared

124
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:37,090
already; they are quite equipped with all
the knowledge that is necessary, like a feedback

125
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:03,750
as you call it, or we can call it a complete
programming is there. So as soon as you put

126
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:19,820
your hand on a person, the programming starts
working it out. Because it is programming

127
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:39,330
is done by God Almighty, it can never be wrong.
It cannot be two different things, as far

128
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:58,899
as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

129
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:09,820
I have been thinking about writing about all
these big, big peethas that are in India,

130
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:29,909
so it will be helpful to you as well as to
others in India. But here the atmosphere is

131
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:52,049
so bad, as if to think of God, to talk of
God is absolutely wrong, you cannot say. The

132
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:08,799
people are in illusion, and they think that
all these talks has brought us nothing. To

133
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:20,549
them it is the progress of the West is more
effective, more apparent, that they can see

134
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:37,279
how you have progressed in materialism, and
they can’t understand how we could progress

135
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:49,279
with aadhyatma very much in the area of physical
development or mental development.

136
00:28:53,889 --> 00:29:00,889
So now we come to a point where we realize
that it is very important for all the Western

137
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:14,899
people to have the foundation of aadhyatma.
For that it is important to give up some of

138
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,570
your conditionings, because this knowledge
is coming definitely from India. I mean the

139
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:32,570
Indians had all the knowledge of your medical
science, this science, that science, that

140
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:48,029
science. But God’s science is in India,
and for that, what are you going to do? When

141
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:59,179
the question of God’s science is concerned,
what are you going to do about it? How are

142
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:14,620
you going to work it out, that this is the
science of God, and the God’s science has

143
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:28,590
to be understood with full dedication and
devotion?

144
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:35,769
Because of the conditioning of the Western
influence, the Western progress, sometimes

145
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:43,230
we just do not know how to grasp this knowledge
within ourselves; very difficult. But if you

146
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:00,720
can understand that, as for science we had
to accept it fully from the West, you have

147
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:16,809
to accept the knowledge of your Spirit from
the East, East has the knowledge of the Spirit:

148
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:35,690
for 
that you have to be ready to receive it. But
if you are still in your arrogance, if you

149
00:31:55,210 --> 00:32:02,210
are still in your own conditionings, then
you cannot do it. Like a boy who comes from

150
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:16,750
a village, who has never known about science,
and you suddenly put him in a science college,

151
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:29,600
he’ll say: “What is this nonsense, what’s
all this all? I have never known these things.

152
00:32:34,409 --> 00:32:41,409
Why should I use a test tube, why should I
go in the laboratory?” All kinds of things

153
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:53,380
he can start saying, and this conditioning
is there. Then he’ll run away from school

154
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:08,950
within one year or two year, maybe earlier,
and that is what I find is their conditioning,

155
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:28,630
which turns away many people from Sahaja Yoga
after some time.

156
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:36,880
So we must watch our conditionings, what sort
of conditionings we have; while the Indians

157
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:45,830
have conditionings of so-called religious
beliefs and this ritualism, this, that, they

158
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:54,179
are very much conditioned also. But is easy
to overcome that when you realize that whatever

159
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:09,610
your worship: for example, in India everybody
has a kuladevata, means the family’s goddess,

160
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:30,639
everybody has; they must worship that goddess,
particular goddess, everybody has. So they

161
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:40,190
have to, if they just ask: “Mother, are
You that Goddess?” the vibrations start

162
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
flowing. So the conditioning gets very easily
eradicated, but the mental acceptance of something

163
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:02,760
is very difficult to go.

164
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:09,760
And I’ve seen also when they get married
or marriage is arranged, they go mental. They

165
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:21,450
go mental. If you go mental, then you cannot
understand many things. But if you are spiritual,

166
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:39,700
then you can understand. For example, we see
Mother Earth giving us these flowers and all

167
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:49,750
that, how can we go mental about it? It’s
a living process. For any living process we

168
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:54,770
cannot get mental. So now you will say: “All
right, this is because of seed has got this,

169
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:58,480
and the seed is planted”; but how, why?
That you can’t answer, can never answer.

170
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,300
Then you’ll keep quiet. But say if there’s
a sage, he’ll say: “All right, this is

171
00:35:59,300 --> 00:35:59,550
Mother Earth, She wants to give to Her children,
these flowers, fruits, these trees, so She’s

172
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:04,630
working it out.” So one has to jump from
one conditioning of materialism.

173
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:11,630
Now you should see in matter, energy never
moves. Energy is stationary, it never moves.

174
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:21,470
And also energies which are moving, so-called,
like electricity, this, that, are absolutely

175
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,339
blind. Supposing there is electricity here
flowing, all right, well and good, but supposing

176
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:31,339
somebody stops it, it will stop. It has no
mind, it is a mindless thing. So in materialism

177
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:42,280
you become mindless. You start seeing also
that within yourself, that you have become

178
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,380
mindless; and becoming absolutely, absolutely,
I should say, like robots sometimes, which

179
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:51,380
is mindless, which is fixed, fixed quantity.
And I see very much clearly, in the West I’ve

180
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:59,200
seen, that people have very fixed ideas. It’s
difficult for them to get out of it because

181
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:10,579
they don’t have that movement towards the
spiritual subtlety, where one can use the

182
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:14,250
mind to do something. We would say that Mother
Earth has got the mind. Now that nobody can

183
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:19,869
believe in the West, except for Sahaja Yogis.
That the Mother Earth produces these vigrahas,

184
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:25,390
She produces these deities, nobody will believe.
How can you believe such a thing, that this

185
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,400
Mother Earth thinks, that this Mother Earth
produces these things? But logically you can

186
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,329
see, logically. Logically.

187
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:36,329
Say a tree has a certain height, the fruits
have a certain shape, certain colors, flowers

188
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:43,030
same: who changes all the seasons, specially
in India is very clear-cut six seasons? It’s

189
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:48,410
called as Ritambhara pragya in the Hatha Yoga.
Now that is the One which is a Lady, which

190
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:55,410
thinks. She has a mind of Her own, She decides
and She works out everything. This concept

191
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:58,930
was doubly denied in the West, is first is
that they cannot accept a Goddess. Woman has

192
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:05,930
no part. Right from Socrates onward, nobody
has talked much about a Woman, except of course

193
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:13,440
there is Athena and all that, but it’s very
minor roles they have. Greeks had goddesses

194
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:26,290
who were just like human beings, so that also
gets ruled out, and very little was accepted;

195
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,550
and when Christianity came, somehow or other
Christians saw to it that there should be

196
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:36,970
no mention of the Mother in any way. But despite
that, people worshipped the Mother. They worshipped

197
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:43,970
the Mother of Christ as, some like a Goddess;
though in the Bible She’s talked as a “woman”,

198
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:55,190
in a very derogatory style She’s addressed.

199
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:08,609
So the conditioning of people is about the
power of God who hangs somewhere in the air,

200
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:19,920
that He’s there and that He gives us everything;
but what is the communication? What is the

201
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:35,609
justification or what is the logical thing,
how to explain? So you have to say: “It

202
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:50,619
is a mystery. God is a mystery. He hangs somewhere
in the air. He does everything.” And how

203
00:39:54,079 --> 00:40:01,079
can people believe in it? So the Christian
conditioning has been even worse than, I think,

204
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,730
Jew conditioning because they just took it
out, Christ’s Mother, away; though the painters,

205
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:12,730
artists wouldn’t do that, they wouldn’t
accept: they had the Mother there. But despite

206
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:20,270
all that, the Motherhood has not been respected
that should have been, in the Bible, which

207
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:27,270
is a very wrong thing, while Mahalakshmi Herself
incarnated as Mother Mary Herself. And to

208
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:33,480
say about Mahalakshmi as “a woman”, I
think is a great insult. And where women are

209
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,930
insulted like this, where the Goddesses are
insulted, we cannot expect any spiritual growth

210
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,710
unless and until you accept that it’s the
Shakti, is the Motherhood, who is the only

211
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,890
thing that’s the communication between us
and the Divinity. So this conditioning, Christian

212
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,720
conditioning has to go out, as far as the
Motherhood is concerned. It’s very surprising

213
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,540
sometimes when I see how these people have
tried to bring down the level of a Goddess

214
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:45,790
to just a woman.

215
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:45,790
So this is a very big blessing in India, that
they respect Mother as the Shakti, and that

216
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:46,550
the whole thing is done by the movement of
the Shakti, by the thinking of the Shakti,

217
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,200
by the coordination and the understanding
and the planning of the Shakti only. It’s

218
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,599
not done by God Almighty, He’s just a spectator.
She does everything. Once that concept can

219
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,339
fit into your heads properly, then you will
see so many conditionings will drop out; because

220
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:55,069
religion was organized, and in an organized
religion you can put whatever you like, the

221
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:58,260
way you want to put it, and it was such a
big mistake. By that people developed a lot

222
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:58,790
of ego, lot of things against women, and also
the first sin they call the “original sin”

223
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,720
and all that is because of a woman, they really
ill-treated women and they have no respect

224
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:00,970
for them.

225
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:00,980
So the women have changed their role, and
instead of becoming mothers and goddesses,

226
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,490
they have tried to become something like actresses.
But you can understand that without the power

227
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:10,490
there is no sense in anything, and this is
the power of Love and this is the power of

228
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:18,890
Truth. And once you get that power we should
humble down, and know that this power is within

229
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:18,920
us, which has given us all this knowledge,
which has given us all this ability to raise

230
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,990
the Kundalini. All this is because of energy
within us, the Shakti within us. Without that

231
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,609
we are nothing. And that too is the Mother
who has done it.

232
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:31,609
I do not know how much to press this point,
but it’s important; because I find, specially

233
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,849
in England some newspaper people came: “How
do you feel as a guru, as a woman?” I mean,

234
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:35,930
it’s a kind of a thing, “a woman”, as
if I am sort of a, that movement where women

235
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:40,670
are starting a fight with the men, sort of
a thing, and now: “This is another guru

236
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:45,450
who is a woman, so She should be supported,”
or some sort of a nonsense like that. It’s

237
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,910
the only the Mother who does this job, so
there’s no question of asking such a question.

238
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:48,680
But that’s what it is, that we should first
know that it’s the feminine quality of a

239
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,660
woman as a mother, is very powerful. But we
should encourage it and try to develop it,

240
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,030
so that spiritually you can communicate, spiritually
you can imbibe these qualities for your own

241
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,680
children. The mothers who do not have aadhyatma
can never develop good children with proper

242
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:51,930
emotions, with proper value system of morality.
So it is very important for every mother to

243
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,280
be very proud that they are mothers, and for
girls who are going to be mothers to be very

244
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,710
proud that they are going to be mothers, and
that they represent the Shakti.

245
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,680
So now then, what is the part of the men is
to take full advantage of that power, by understanding

246
00:41:59,680 --> 00:41:59,930
it, by complementing, by looking after that
power. I’m not talking only about your wives.

247
00:41:59,680 --> 00:41:59,930
I’m talking about your sisters, your daughters,
your mothers, and the whole society, where

248
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,300
women are to be respected, and they have to
be respectable. And women should try to be

249
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:09,000
respectable, to try to know that they are
the powers and they are the ones who will

250
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,700
be used by this Divine power as channels,
more than men. But if they are useless, then

251
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,089
of course they wouldn’t bother about them,
they would like to bother then about men,

252
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:17,550
much more than what you are. So it is important
to understand what is your role in Sahaja

253
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:19,020
Yoga. This is your role in Sahaja Yoga. And
I am sure you can work it out. You can manage

254
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,140
this part. You can equip yourself for this
role, which is so beautiful and so good.

255
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,780
So much can be said about Mahalakshmi, and
there’s no end to it, but I think later

256
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,190
on we should keep this program on every year,
and you all should come to Mahalakshmi Temple

257
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:30,290
here, to the, I mean the Kolhapur, and then
I’ll again tell you all about the Mother’s

258
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,079
qualities, what She is as Mahalakshmi.

259
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,720
And today we’ll have the Shri Sukta. Shri
Sukta is about Mahalakshmi’s qualities.

260
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,420
I think we’ll have Ganesha Stuthi and then
we’ll have this. So seriously you must understand

261
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:37,670
what is it…

262
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:41,240
I’m just in meditative mood today, I don’t
know what I’m talking; because this Mahalakshmi

263
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,410
is a thing that goes, finishes everything
else. Left, right is finished now, you are

264
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,520
just in Mahalakshmi state: what to do? “Mahalakshmi
state” means nirvichar, nirvikalp, beyond

265
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,910
that, I don’t know what stages it is. It
comes down a little bit, then again it goes

266
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:49,220
back to the same.

267
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:49,680
