00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:58,120
First three minutes are without sound.

The Left Side - Problems of the Subconscious

3
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:38,220
May 13th, 1982, Christchurch Hove, Brighton, England

4
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,120
Good conditionings.

5
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,200
In the way, in the same way, you can have good habits

6
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,170
and bad habits.

7
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,140
If habits inhibit or

8
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,010
obstruct your ascent,

9
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:38,020
they also can help to stabilize you.

10
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,040
The conditioning comes to you from the matter

11
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,230
with which we are dealing every day.

12
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:59,020
When a human being sees the matter, he aggressor it and

13
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,010
he wants to use that matter for his own purpose.

14
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,240
He changes the forms of the matter for his own purpose.

15
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,210
He starts getting used to matter

16
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,130
as comfort, or as a help or a guide in life.

17
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,240
The more you start depending on matter,

18
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,100
the more your spontaneity is finished,

19
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,110
because you’re dealing with the dead.

20
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,180
Matter, when it is dead, then only we deal with it.

21
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,180
When it is living we are not so much bothered about it.

22
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:49,000
So the deadness of that matter settles within us when

23
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:54,240
we start using that matter for our purpose.

24
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,170
But how are we to otherwise exist? Is the question

25
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,050
people can ask. If God has given us this material things

26
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,200
and this matter to be used,

27
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,240
are we not supposed to use them?

28
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,160
And are we not supposed to enjoy them?

29
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,220
But we don’t enjoy. We …

30
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,130
before Realization you cannot enjoy any matter.

31
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,140
You can only form a habit and may become

32
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,100
a slave of that matter, before Realization.

33
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,180
It’s a principle of, fundamental principle of economics

34
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,090
that wants in general are never satiable.

35
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,190
Means today you want to buy something like a carpet.

36
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,030
All right, you bought it.

37
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,000
So now that carpet becames a headache, because it’s

38
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,040
your possession, you have to look after it.

39
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,140
You have to insure it, you have to worry about it that it

40
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,040
doesn’t get spoiled, first of all.

41
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,010
And secondly you really get

42
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,020
into another mood of buying something else.

43
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,180
Now you have bought the carpet, finished.

44
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,120
Then you have to have something else, then you have to

45
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,200
have something else,

46
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,040
then you have to have something else.

47
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,110
So it does not satiate you; it does not give you the joy.

48
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,220
Matter can never give you joy.

49
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,210
It’s the Spirit that gives you joy.

50
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,190
And when the ascent takes place,

51
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,130
when you become the Spirit, then matter takes another

52
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,200
value system within ourselves,

53
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,150
the value system of matter is very different.

54
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,130
As I’m sure Jason must have told you that

55
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,180
when you get your Realization,

56
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,030
then you start feeling the Cool Breeze in the hand.

57
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,040
In relationship to matter

58
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,040
it’s very helpful to be a realized soul,

59
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:04,020
because immediately you know

60
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,020
what is good for you and what is bad for you.

61
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,060
For example, you eat something that’s not good for you.

62
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,000
Immediately you’ll lose your vibrations

63
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,150
and will become hot.

64
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,150
Even looking at it, it may happen.

65
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,230
You want to sit on a chair on which somebody who is a

66
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,170
very wrong type of a person has sat,

67
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,230
immediately you’ll feel, “Oh, something wrong

68
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,100
in this place.” With your vibrations,

69
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,130
which is a definite thing, an absolute thing.

70
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,060
And this conditioning can only be over –

71
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,050
these habits can be overcome only if you become the Spirit,

72
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,170
because Spirit is always dominated by the matter.

73
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,000
And the Spirit has to overcome that domination of the matter.

74
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:58,230
Actually, Spirit cannot be dominated by anything.

75
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,240
But what I mean is that it is covered, like the sun can be

76
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,240
covered with clouds.

77
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,230
In the same way all our domination,

78
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:17,110
or we can say all our enslavement of the matter,

79
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,090
makes us dominate our Spirit in the sense that

80
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,040
we cover it up. The clouds are there,

81
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,000
we can’t see the Spirit. We can’t feel It.

82
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,150
The spontaneity which is the beauty of the Spirit

83
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,240
we do not feel, in a person.

84
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,040
So, in judging a person, what do we judge?

85
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,060
How that person looks, what dress he’s wearing,

86
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,050
how he walks. What are his formal ways,

87
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,160
does he know how to say “Thank you”, “Sorry” or not.

88
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,070
You see? All these things impress us very much.

89
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,200
What sort of a car he has, what sort of a house he has.

90
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:56,200
Maybe we may miss, we may miss a saint.

91
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,140
We may miss Christ again

92
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,210
because He was a carpenter’s son.

93
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,030
How are we to know who is Christ?

94
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:11,110
Is there any way of finding out who is Christ?

95
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,210
Many people are now talking “Christ is going to come,

96
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,170
He’s going to come on the television.”

97
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,140
You can put up anyone there as Christ.

98
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,040
How are we going to make it out?

99
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,060
By His dress or by some sort of a thing they have done?

100
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,040
Most of the paintings of Christ and most of His statues

101
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,230
that I’ve seen are no where near Christ,

102
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,020
no where near Christ, you see.

103
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,230
They are horrid things. I don’t know what are they.

104
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,100
So how will you make it out that this is Christ or not?

105
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,080
Or this is some sort of a hokus pokus fellow or some sort

106
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,070
of a person who has come just deliberately to delude us

107
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,210
from reality.

108
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,180
There is no way out, to find out

109
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,140
what is the truth because we are so much used to material

110
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,040
forms that we have.

111
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,200
For example, our idea of art also is in the same way

112
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,110
molded.

113
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,180
We like this kind of art.

114
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,020
If you ask them, “Why?”

115
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,150
“Because, you know, this has this kind of a thing

116
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,060
– harmony” Or maybe,

117
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,170
“this is more proportioned” and all that.

118
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,030
But how do you know?”

119
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,110
You know because you’ve read certain books or maybe

120
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:34,190
that you have understood from somebody else

121
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,150
that this is art, this is beautiful. I mean, you brand

122
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,070
something as beautiful, but is it really?

123
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,030
If it is beauty, it should be Spirit, because

124
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,040
Spirit is beauty and beauty is Spirit.

125
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,220
So is it, is it beauty? How do you make out

126
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,130
that this art is beautiful or not?

127
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,220
For example, according to all normal ideas of

128
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,090
womanhood, I don’t think

129
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,010
Mona Lisa is a beautiful woman.

130
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,090
I mean, these days you see mosquito-like women are

131
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,040
regarded as beautiful.

132
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,150
So how they call Mona Lisa so beautiful?

133
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,000
What’s going on?

134
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,080
Thousands of people would be assembled to see that

135
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,160
painting. Why? What is that?

136
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,020
Only vibrations will tell you that it emits vibrations.

137
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
It appeals to your Spirit without your knowledge.

138
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,140
You’re not aware of it. It appeals to your Spirit.

139
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:34,090
That’s why universally that painting is appreciated.

140
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,180
But when this conditioning becomes collective,

141
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,000
any such conditioning becomes collective and you

142
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:45,010
accept, “This is the form that is beauty; this is the form

143
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:50,120
that is reality; this is the form that is spontaneity”,

144
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,190
then the confusion starts.

145
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,170
The confusion starts at that point,

146
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,130
when it becomes a collective thing.

147
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,050
For example I met some people of some gurus.

148
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,040
And I asked them,

149
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,180
“What makes you think that your guru is truthful,

150
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,030
what has he given you?

151
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,240
He said, “because sitting in my chair I just start jumping

152
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,100
by myself. I don’t do it but it happens, it’s spontaneous.”

153
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,100
And in my presence, the way his body was moving was

154
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,170
so horrifying.

155
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,090
Anybody would have tremendous compassion

156
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,020
and concern for such a person,

157
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,110
that you can’t sit for five minutes straight …

158
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,070
A woman in the audience says: Excuse me, it wasn’t

159
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,080
spontaneous, it was nerve …

160
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,080
Yes, that’s what I’m saying …

161
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,230
Woman: You’re wrong in what You talk.

162
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,060
What?

163
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,220
Woman: About everything

164
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,210
From where do you come?

165
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,130
Woman: Up the road.

166
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,110
That’s it. Better go.

167
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,090
Woman: Don’t worry. I am.

168
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,240
Look at that. She’ll go to the pub now.

169
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,070
Must try to understand the subtleties, you see?

170
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,080
If you are confirmed it what.

171
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,010
Now supposing somebody starts jumping in the thing.

172
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,200
As she says it’s true – nerves.

173
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,030
That means you’re not in control of your nerves, isn’t it?

174
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,240
Don’t you think so? You’re not in control.

175
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,050
You have not controlled.

176
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,160
Spontaneity is a thing which is not the thing that makes

177
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,120
you a slave.

178
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,090
This is the point I’m trying to bring.

179
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,000
It doesn’t; it makes you a master.

180
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,230
Spontaneity must make you a master

181
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,150
and not a slave of anything.

182
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,120
She must have come from TM because TM people

183
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,110
jump like that.

184
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,060
And they end up as epileptic people.

185
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,200
I have cured so many of them.

186
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,140
I don’t know if someone has come from there.

187
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,140
Even the head of their academy in Scotland who –

188
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,120
flying squad academy, as I call it,

189
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,220
where people pay three thousand – now this gentleman

190
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,020
sitting here is one of them who suffered.

191
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,000
When they suffer then they know what it is.

192
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,150
The other day we saw somebody with epilepsy of such

193
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,210
frequency. The poor child, he was hardly twenty-six

194
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,180
years of age, young man, supposed to enjoy his life,

195
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,230
was going into such trauma, you can’t imagine.

196
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,120
And if this is happening to somebody going to a guru,

197
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,040
you paid for it,

198
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,020
how can it be anywhere near Spirit?

199
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,210
This is what I’m trying to tell you, that

200
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,090
Spirit gives you spontaneity in which you are the master.

201
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:43,090
You are the master of yourself, complete master,

202
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,010
no enslavement of any kind, no habits formation coming.

203
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,190
All habits drop out.

204
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,230
You become so, so spontaneous that I don’t have to tell you.

205
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,070
You just drop out all habits and you become a

206
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,010
master of your self.

207
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,160
That should happen to you.

208
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,230
Instead of that, if you indulge into things which enslave

209
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,010
you, you will like it for awhile

210
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,230
because you can’t help it.

211
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,040
But, if you really sit down you will know that it’s not the

212
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,040
thing that you wanted.

213
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,120
You wanted to be the master of your self.

214
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,050
Now here in this map as we show we have two powers,

215
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,010
left and right powers.

216
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,100
The left power is the power that gives us conditioning –

217
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,160
left side, the subconscious, the collective subconscious.

218
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,030
That gives us the conditioning.

219
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,110
Now, if you try to deny all that, then the right side is

220
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,060
even worse.

221
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,070
It gives us action, but with action we can become very

222
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,150
ego oriented.

223
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,110
So both ways it can be troublesome.

224
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,200
Supposing you say that “All right, I’ll have no

225
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,190
conditioning from anytime. What’s wrong in doing this?

226
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,180
What’s wrong in doing that?”

227
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,190
And if you just move with that idea, with that freedom,

228
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,190
it will be abandonment, it may not be freedom.

229
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,030
Because freedom must have wisdom behind it.

230
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,140
So both the sides,

231
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,030
the movements on both the sides are wrong.

232
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,240
So what is all right?

233
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:16,200
In the center is not to get conditioned by anything and

234
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,020
not to be ego oriented.

235
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,050
But how to do it is the problem.

236
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,090
The problem is how to do it.

237
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:31,130
To be spontaneous is to be absolutely free.

238
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,200
Now I would consider these two powers as, say, a brake

239
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,010
and an accelerator in a car.

240
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,220
Now you use both the powers.

241
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,220
You use the brake first, you use the accelerator.

242
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,130
You try to control these two powers.

243
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,140
But, first of all it is difficult to understand

244
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,090
how you can use these powers.

245
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,110
Gradually, with practice you’ll do it.

246
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,060
You know how to drive the car,

247
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,120
you become the good driver.

248
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,010
After becoming the good driver, still

249
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,000
you are not the master of the driving,

250
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,190
but then you become the master.

251
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,180
So, today the master within us, within us is the Spirit.

252
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,190
But before Realization, you are not the master

253
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:20,220
because the master has not come in our conscious mind.

254
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,140
It is not expressing in our conscious mind.

255
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:31,070
In the sense that we are not empowered by Its powers.

256
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,050
The Spirit exists; It has Its own powers.

257
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,000
But we haven’t felt those powers within us.

258
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,230
Once we feel the powers of the Spirit,

259
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,200
we are empowered by our own powers which are there.

260
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,020
The powers are within us.

261
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,050
These are our own powers.

262
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,190
We don’t have to borrow from anyone, ask from anyone,

263
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,050
they are in ourselves.

264
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,030
The Spirit is within us –

265
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,100
only thing that Spirit has to bring light in our,

266
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,170
in our consciousness.

267
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,100
It has to come in our consciousness.

268
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,150
In simple medical terminology we can see, say that the

269
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:19,220
Spirit must manifest Itself in our central nervous system,

270
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,010
in our central nervous system so that we should know

271
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,190
what we are doing.

272
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,090
Not that we start just jumping on the chair, or some

273
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,190
people said, “Oh you, we just start doing it.”

274
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,140
It is hypnosis.

275
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,010
It’s not correct. You’re not in conscious mind.

276
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,090
You are doing it out of hypnosis.

277
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,020
Hypnosis may be coming from outside force.

278
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,230
It’s not your force, your awareness,

279
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,150
your understanding, your power.

280
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,070
It is somebody else’s because you’re not doing it.

281
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,190
As matter has a power to overpower us, in the same way

282
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:03,020
there are some material things, I should say, which are

283
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,200
very dangerous, which are placed.

284
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,110
For example now cancer, take cancer,

285
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,100
cancer overpowers.

286
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,220
It’s a very serious thing.

287
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,160
Cancer overpowers you; you cannot overpower cancer.

288
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,160
Take a very concrete example.

289
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,150
Now how is it caused?

290
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,050
Doctors say this way, that way.

291
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,190
We, Sahaja Yoga can cure cancer, definitely a hundred

292
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,060
percent it can cure, it has cured.

293
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,220
Many Sahaj Yogis have cured cancer.

294
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,160
How? Is very simple.

295
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,040
That you become master of yourself and you master the

296
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,030
disease also,

297
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,170
you master everything.

298
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,220
Because the master is within you,

299
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,040
it has not come in your conscious mind is the only link is

300
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,220
left, and when that happens Yoga takes place,

301
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,080
union takes place.

302
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,060
We should now completely keep ourselves limited to

303
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,150
Self Realization, about God I’ll tell next time.

304
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,180
Self-Realization means to bring your Spirit

305
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,010
into your conscious mind.

306
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,210
Now how cancer is caused? Let’s see here what happens.

307
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,070
It is caused by left-sided activity.

308
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,180
Now left sided activities are emotional traumas,

309
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,010
emotional problems, emotional upheavals,

310
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,070
emotional insecurities – any kind of insecurity can take

311
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,230
you to the left side.

312
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,100
Little more movement can be these horrible gurus

313
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,000
because they hypnotize you.

314
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,070
They put you to the left.

315
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,130
They put some spirit in you or I don’t know what they do,

316
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,170
but they put you to the left.

317
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,130
Any one of these activities which are not authorized by

318
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,170
God, taken to, you go to the left side,

319
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,080
because you cannot ascend in the center.

320
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,140
So either you go to the left or to the right.

321
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,100
When you overdo these things, like black magic - you

322
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,090
have another thing here I’ve heard,

323
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,010
some sort of a organization had, and the fellow you see

324
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,060
he used to, everything he saw moving in the house.

325
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,000
He came to Sahaj Yoga and his water jug was moving

326
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,100
there and this was moving there and he couldn’t explain

327
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,190
what was happening in his room.

328
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,180
He was sitting down and he found something moving

329
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,050
from here to here. It happens.

330
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,120
What is that? What is that doing this kind of a thing

331
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,230
which you cannot control.

332
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,040
Again we come to the same point –

333
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,220
something you cannot control.

334
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,120
So you enter into the realm, into the realm

335
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,120
where you are controlled and you are not under your own

336
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,030
control and that realm, when you enter in,

337
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,090
I have always seen all the cancer patients

338
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:47,050
are the ones affected by this.

339
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:51,060
Most of them. They’re not aware;

340
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,090
they do not know how they get into it.

341
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,160
For a lady, supposing, say she’s suffering from an

342
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,150
insecurity about her husband or maybe something, or

343
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,150
maybe she thinks that her husband may leave her any time.

344
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,140
She loves him. Whatever it is,

345
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:11,000
such a woman might get a breast cancer,

346
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,230
because the insecurities set in, in one of the centers there

347
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,230
which you can see here, the center of the Heart -

348
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,130
Center heart, as we call it.

349
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:25,000
Now if this center goes out of order,

350
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,040
if a woman feels insecure for anything whatsoever,

351
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,090
she’s capable – she’s vulnerable to be attacked and she

352
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,090
can get into cancer.

353
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,150
So we have to understand life in totality,

354
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,050
and not in one way.

355
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,120
The total impact of life, the total effect of life,

356
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:50,160
the total relationship with life must be understood.

357
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,070
Now no doctor knows this.

358
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,230
Will he know, when he treats the patient for, say,

359
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:02,240
breast cancer will he know that this lady is insecure?

360
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,180
There’s another disease – anorexia –

361
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,130
many girls suffer from it.

362
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,000
They don’t just eat. They just give up eating.

363
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,080
Now, you do not know why it happens.

364
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,130
Doctors can’t cure it; nobody can cure it.

365
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,010
What is the reason?

366
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:24,120
The relationship of a girl, of a daughter with the father.

367
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:28,000
Say father dies and the daughter doesn’t see the father,

368
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:33,020
or in heart she loves the father but she doesn’t express it,

369
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,090
or there’s some bad relationship that comes between the

370
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,150
father and the daughter,

371
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,240
you get this trouble – anorexia.

372
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,190
You’ll be amazed but it is impossible for doctors to get –

373
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,230
we have some doctors sitting here –

374
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:54,040
it is impossible for any medical science to go near it.

375
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,040
Because we do not see a human being in its totality.

376
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,190
It’s a very delicate instrument God has created.

377
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,210
The way we are harsh with others,

378
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:11,000
the way we sometimes try to trouble others,

379
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:17,220
try to make others feel insecured or unfair, unjust.

380
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,140
Without our knowledge we really give them

381
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:26,190
a tremendous insecurity, and such insecurities can

382
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:34,030
work out incurable diseases of which we are not aware.

383
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:38,170
So to understand the totality, what should happen to us?

384
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,150
We should achieve that state where we can see

385
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,060
the totality.

386
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,130
Like if I have to see now, for example, the whole of

387
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,090
Brighton, what should I do?

388
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,230
I should go on a plane and see it from that height.

389
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,150
I can see the whole. In the same way in your awareness,

390
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,000
in your understanding, you should rise to that point from

391
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,120
where you can see the whole.

392
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:10,080
If you cannot see the whole, the partial vision, or we can

393
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:16,170
say, a little that you see can create confusion,

394
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,130
can create problems and some of them could be of a

395
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,090
very, very serious nature.

396
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:31,010
Because as human beings, we do not know what are we.

397
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:36,100
This is the greatest problem of human beings,

398
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,020
that they’ll say, “I don’t like it.”

399
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:42,240
Now which one is this “I”? Is that your Spirit, or is that

400
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,110
your ego?

401
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,150
What is the part that is not liking it?

402
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,160
Or is it your conditioning, because you’re brought up in a

403
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,190
particular way so you don’t like this?

404
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,160
Which part of you is not liking it?

405
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,030
And you’d be amazed that it is not your Spirit because if

406
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,100
Spirit likes, how will you know?

407
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,230
It’s only through your vibrations.

408
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,130
When you can feel the vibrations, then only you will say,

409
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,030
“Yes, my Spirit likes it”,

410
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,160
because the vibrations have emitted.

411
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:22,010
So we are still in a transition state as human beings.

412
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:26,050
We have not achieved that state which is called as the

413
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:31,020
state of Self-Realization where you become the Spirit -

414
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
the becoming is the point.

415
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:38,020
Where you become the Spirit you know what you like.

416
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,010
You really know what you really like,

417
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,030
because you are now the reality,

418
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,230
you are not any conditioning,

419
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,150
you are no more an ego, but you are what you are really,

420
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,220
and that is your Spirit.

421
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,100
And, surprisingly this Spirit is a collective being.

422
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,220
Is no artificial collectivity within us.

423
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,130
That also “All right, we belong to all Brighton so we are

424
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,080
one” or “We belong to one street so we are one.”

425
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,210
It’s not like that, but is something that you are,

426
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,190
absolutely you are a collective being,

427
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,190
and you start feeling that collectivity within you

428
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,150
with these different centers working it out.

429
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,010
And you can feel it - others,

430
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,100
you can feel others on your finger tips.

431
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,200
Can you believe?

432
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,150
In the Bible it’s written that your hands will speak.

433
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,160
The description of these days is that your hands will speak.

434
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,200
Why not people go and find out how does it happen?

435
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,160
How can your hands speak?

436
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,220
This is what happens that on your finger tips you start

437
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,140
feeling and understanding what is reality,

438
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,040
what is beauty, what is joy, what is love.

439
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,060
This is the left side

440
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:03,000
which we get, and ultimately with this left side problems

441
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,240
we get physical pain.

442
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,170
It’s very painful to have left sided problems –

443
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,120
it’s very, very painful.

444
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,220
The pain cannot be explained, no one can understand,

445
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,010
nobody can cure it, you can’t tell anyone

446
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,160
and people think that you are fussing, they give you

447
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,170
psychological treatment, you just don’t understand

448
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,020
why this pain is within you.

449
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,200
And this pain comes to you from left side,

450
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,090
the subconscious.

451
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,110
But beyond the subconscious is the collective

452
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,080
subconscious,

453
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:40,030
and this collective subconscious is the one where

454
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:47,030
whatever is created from the beginning up to today

455
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,090
in the creation is within. And once you go to the

456
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,150
subconscious, you just get lost there.

457
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,080
You are so overpowered by this power of subconscious

458
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:03,070
that it is beyond you to understand it,

459
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:08,090
beyond you to get out of it and beyond you to –

460
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,130
not to succumb to it.

461
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,160
And it goes on increasing.

462
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,070
Like I asked some people,

463
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,100
“Why did you go on doing it when you knew that you

464
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,000
were not doing it, somebody else was doing it?

465
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,030
Still why did you continue to do it?”

466
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,080
They said, “Mother, we were under the blanket,

467
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,190
it was darkness, we didn’t know where we were moving

468
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,050
and were just going on and on and on.”

469
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,160
And as I told you last time, feeling guilty is the biggest

470
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,170
blockade.

471
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,130
Is the biggest blockade because once you start feeling

472
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:43,030
guilty that this center on the left gets blocked and the –

473
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,200
it’s very difficult.

474
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,100
And you don’t know why you are feeling guilty.

475
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,140
All the time you’re feeling guilty but you don’t know

476
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,210
why you’re feeling guilty, why these ideas of guilt are

477
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,130
coming to you, that this feeling of guilt keeps you away

478
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:01,010
from joy, from enjoying anything, from being

479
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,100
spontaneous.

480
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:10,000
Why? And this explains why we sometimes are

481
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,050
miserable for nothing at all.

482
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,030
Actually, God has not created us to be miserable.

483
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,140
He has made us so beautifully, so carefully.

484
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,180
He has created us with such love and compassion,

485
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,190
not to make us feel miserable, not for anything.

486
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:31,030
He doesn’t give us any diseases, no problems.

487
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,230
But we have done these things to ourselves by going to

488
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,130
extremes on the left or the right.

489
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,000
As I am today talking about only on the left,

490
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,160
I would say that to feel miserable for nothing at all is

491
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,120
also wrong, is being unjust to yourself.

492
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:52,070
The people who are left sided must know that they are

493
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:57,120
the Spirit, that they are that beauty which has to come,

494
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,100
which has to express itself.

495
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,110
That they are not the people who have to suffer

496
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,090
all the time and to live like miserable people.

497
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,010
They are not.

498
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,010
But because they take so much upon themselves,

499
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,160
bear so much upon themselves, they become like that.

500
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,130
And to avoid that bearing up they may take to some other

501
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,050
habits, you see. Many people take to alcohol

502
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,130
also for reason because they can’t bear the pangs of life,

503
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,110
they can’t bear it. That’s why they take to it …

504
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,030
but once the Spirit is awakened within you,

505
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:36,090
you become so strong. You become so joyous,

506
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,010
so spontaneous that all these things drop out,

507
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:43,180
all those things – so-called diseases, so-called habits -

508
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,110
just drop out

509
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,190
and you become a new, blooming personality.

510
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:57,120
Now the basics of having this center within you –

511
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,070
you can blame God for that, “Why did He give us these

512
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,160
centers on the left hand side, what was the need?

513
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,230
He should not have given these left sided ones, so we

514
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,100
would have been just in the center to go.”

515
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:13,010
But the trouble is the human beings have to know

516
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,210
in their own freedom, how to deal with themselves.

517
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,240
They have to learn little hard way the wisdom.

518
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,040
They have to learn by going to extremes

519
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,120
they have suffered. They have to realize it

520
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,050
because if they have to become truly, absolutely free

521
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,140
they have to rise in their wisdom.

522
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,170
If they’re not wise people, then they cannot enter into the

523
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,050
Kingdom of God, because they’ll be abandoned people.

524
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,240
Say, people who are abandoned, who don’t understand

525
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,210
any laws or regulations, if you get them in England,

526
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,100
we’ll have to put them in jail.

527
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,030
In the same way, human beings who have not got that

528
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,240
wisdom within themselves –

529
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,160
through sufferings only one learns, but we should not ask

530
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,060
for suffering. When we ask for sufferings, we are asking

531
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,190
actually for mistakes to begin with.

532
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
How will you suffer if you do not commit mistakes?

533
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,190
So, when we ask for sufferings we are committing

534
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,080
mistakes.

535
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:19,150
So what we should ask for is nothing but our Spirit,

536
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,240
and if you ask for your Spirit,

537
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,090
it is your own and you have to get it.

538
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,080
It is in your own right that you’re going to get it.

539
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,110
It’s no way that I’m obliging you or doing something

540
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,170
special for you. It’s all there.

541
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,200
You are like a light which is just to be enlightened

542
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,210
because I’m an enlightened light and you become an

543
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,240
enlightened light, you can enlighten other lights also.

544
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,060
It’s very simple.

545
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,190
If you become an enlightened light,

546
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,060
you can enlighten others.

547
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,210
You don’t have to bother about anything else then.

548
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:55,050
You become an enlightened light yourself, that’s the point.

549
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,100
It is all there, it is all your own, you have to just have it.

550
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:05,170
It is as simple as that, there is nothing very complicated

551
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,090
as these people make it or anything that these

552
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:12,020
philosophers have put before you, nothing of the kind.

553
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:16,080
It’s very simple, it is within you, it is spontaneous,

554
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:19,120
it is a living process as in living process you have

555
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,220
become human beings,

556
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,230
you are going to become super human beings.

557
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,060
It’s absolutely spontaneous, you can’t pay for it.

558
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,040
How can you pay? I mean, absurd it is!

559
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:34,170
If it is a living process, how can you pay?

560
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,130
How much do you pay to the tree to grow up?

561
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,210
I mean in anything living, do we pay anything?

562
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,120
How much do we pay our nose to breathe?

563
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,070
Can we pay for it? It’s absurd, it’s ridiculous.

564
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,100
We cannot pay for it, we cannot, it’s a living process,

565
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:54,000
you have to become, an egg has to become a chick.

566
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,210
Now how much do you pay an egg to become a chick, or

567
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:01,060
how much does the egg pay to the mother for becoming a

568
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,170
chicken?

569
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,080
It’s that ridiculous, but we never understand that living

570
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,240
things are so spontaneous.

571
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,170
We never see living things, we live with matter,

572
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,150
we live with the dead, not with the living things.

573
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,090
If you start watching a tree, you start watching a flower,

574
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,060
how it becomes a fruit.

575
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,080
You can’t even watch because it does it so slowly,

576
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,020
you can’t even watch a flower becoming a fruit.

577
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,160
Suddenly you find all coming up.

578
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:37,110
Like when I came to London from India I found all the

579
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,140
trees were bare,

580
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:43,180
absolutely like dry sticks, absolutely like dry sticks.

581
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,030
Within a week, what I find is the green coming up;

582
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,090
and within second week it was all lush,

583
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,060
you can’t believe it.

584
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,060
We never even notice, we take it for granted.

585
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,130
It’s happening. How does it happen?

586
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,180
It’s a miraculous thing.

587
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,070
If you see it, it’s miraculous how these flowers, for

588
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,040
example the particular flowers are only on a particular

589
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,030
tree and others, another, are on another tree.

590
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,050
How does it happen?

591
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,190
Who chooses them? Who puts them in proper shape?

592
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,220
Who organizes all that?

593
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,110
And this is what one has to realize and

594
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,130
that is the All Pervading Power of God that does

595
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,170
all the living work.

596
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,200
And once you become that – the Spirit – then this power

597
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,240
starts flowing through you.

598
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,110
You feel the power through you as Christ was touched

599
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:40,000
and He said some power has gone to someone, like that.

600
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,120
You just become a medium of that power flowing.

601
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:48,180
But you are empowered to maneuver it, to manage it,

602
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,110
to understand it.

603
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,160
You know completely about it, you know how to give it,

604
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:56,000
you know to how to work it out, you know how to cure

605
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,190
others, cure yourself.

606
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:02,050
You know the complete working of your machinery.

607
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,030
Apart from that, you get the powers to overcome all the

608
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:10,090
problems of your own machinery also.

609
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,110
It’s so fantastic.

610
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,150
Whole thing sounds very fantastic because we have

611
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,120
never seen this before.

612
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,030
But to us it doesn’t sound fantastic when we see all these

613
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:25,060
flowers suddenly turning into fruits. It doesn’t sound.

614
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,220
But we see human beings turning into fruits,

615
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,070
then it sounds very fantastic, “How can that be?”

616
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,110
It has never happened before.

617
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,060
Only one person would get Realization and it was such a

618
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,140
difficult thing and nobody got it.

619
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,000
How is it today?

620
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,130
I say it is the blossom time which is been promised

621
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:49,080
which is been already prophesized.

622
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,070
Even a great poet in your country, William Blake,

623
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,050
has prophesized it.

624
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,040
He said these times will come when men of God will

625
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,170
become prophets

626
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,240
and these prophets will have power to make other

627
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,090
prophets. I mean nobody could be more precise

628
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,020
than Blake, I tell you. He was so great

629
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,070
to say this will happen and this is what we have to expect

630
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,140
when we go to anybody for seeking.

631
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Have we become prophets? And what is a prophet?

632
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,230
Prophet is a person who is a collective being and

633
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,020
who knows all about it, who is the master.

634
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,220
We call prophet a master.

635
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,160
And that’s what you have to become, the master.

636
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,100
And that mastery is very simple because

637
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:42,050
it’s all built within you, just it has to be connected.

638
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,080
Like, anything like a television set is to be connected to

639
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,040
the mains, it’s all built in, it’s there, it just starts working.

640
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:53,060
In the same way, you are that, you are that.

641
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,210
Just it is to be connected.

642
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,000
Whatever may be your caste, community, race,

643
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,060
nationality, shapes, heights – anything, whatever you

644
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,060
may be – makes no difference because all of you have

645
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:12,050
got this great thing within you, this power of a rebirth

646
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,090
and you are to be born again, and you will be born again.

647
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,020
Why not today?

648
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,210
There’s nothing to get angry, because people get angry

649
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:27,100
sometimes because they don’t like anybody telling them

650
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,230
about something which of which they themselves are

651
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,000
feeling bad.

652
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,130
They don’t like it.

653
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,240
For example if there’s a drunkard and he drinks too

654
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,180
much, he’s an alcoholic, he doesn’t like it

655
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,060
and he feels bad, and if somebody tells him,

656
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,230
even in the most gentlest way that “You’d better give up

657
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,240
drinking”, he doesn’t like it.

658
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:52,020
But what I am saying is not that you should not do it,

659
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,240
I said it will happen that it just drops out.

660
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,090
I don’t say, “You don’t do this” or “Don’t do that”

661
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,210
but it just happens. And you must first understand what

662
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:06,150
is the problem and how the problem is overcome.

663
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,200
That’s why I have to talk, otherwise there’s no need to

664
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,100
talk about it all, it just works out, it just works out

665
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,090
because you are just ready to have it and you just get it.

666
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,140
I don’t do anything. I’m just a catalyst, I should say that

667
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,090
it works out.

668
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:25,120
I hope you’ll ask Me some questions about it first,

669
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:30,010
before we go in for any Realization.

670
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:35,100
If you have any questions, please ask. You must ask.

671
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,070
Yes?

672
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,000
Man: Is there any difference to what You are saying and

673
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:51,050
what guru Maharaji …

674
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Who?

675
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,110
Man: Guru Maharaji

676
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,220
Now, I’ll tell you one thing.

677
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,150
When you talk about any guru I don’t want to go into

678
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:02,020
any controversies. All right? That’s first thing I’ll tell you

679
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:06,000
but I will tell you to ask yourself or ask anyone,

680
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,180
“What has he done for anyone?”

681
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,130
Has he been able to give you any power,

682
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,050
or anyone the power? All right?

683
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,070
Now, I can tell you all these who are here who are

684
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,170
realized souls who are here.

685
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,080
They are just like you to look at.

686
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,050
Of course from face you can make out that they’re very

687
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,040
relaxed and very happy people.

688
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,200
But they can cure people,

689
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,240
they can give Realization to people, they understand

690
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:35,200
everything that is wrong with you and with themselves also,

691
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,140
So what has he done to your awareness?

692
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,110
Nothing.

693
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:45,220
Now, his disciples, what have they achieved?

694
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,110
You ask them, “Where is the Kundalini of this person?

695
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,200
What is the problem of this lady or what is weighing

696
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,070
upon her mind?” They won’t be able to say.

697
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,120
If you cannot even make out what’s wrong with another

698
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,070
person or with yourself, how are you going to help?

699
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:03,180
All such people, what do they do?

700
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,080
Let us see. Simple thing is that

701
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,230
they can mesmerize you.

702
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,210
You may feel happy for awhile – it’s just like drinking.

703
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,090
You know, if you drink, you feel happy.

704
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,090
But, by drinking, what have we achieved?

705
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,150
Have we become masters?

706
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,070
All of them are like that.

707
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:30,170
You see, a decent women so obviously because he

708
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,030
asked for Rolls Royce.

709
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,050
What is a Rolls Royce for a prophet?

710
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,140
I mean what does it matter?

711
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,190
You see my point?

712
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,110
This is so obvious, I mean this is so logically obvious.

713
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:42,180
First of all, anybody who takes money from you is a

714
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,040
parasite, simple as that.

715
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,170
And to ask for Rolls Royce of all the things, you see.

716
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,160
You have got Christ.

717
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,050
You can see from Christ’s life –

718
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,040
will He care for your Rolls Royces?

719
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,090
To such a person, He’s a King, He doesn’t bother

720
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,180
whether He has a Rolls Royce or not, whether He sleeps

721
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,020
on the ground or not, makes no difference.

722
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,040
Such a person doesn’t care for anything,

723
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,190
because He is in comfort, He’s got His own comfort.

724
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,010
He is a man of self-respect.

725
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,170
Do you think He would ask for anything whatsoever?

726
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,160
I mean it’s so obvious, for you people it is so obvious.

727
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,030
But when I talk to some people of this guru,

728
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,090
the particular one you are telling Me, they said,

729
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,150
“ Mother, we give him the metal and he gives the Spirit.”

730
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,040
Can there be an exchange?

731
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,000
Can you purchase your Spirit?

732
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:36,070
Use your logic, all right?

733
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,160
God has given us brains to understand,

734
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:40,000
logically we can use that.

735
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:45,050
Can you purchase, can you purchase the Spirit?

736
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,010
Isn’t it so simple?

737
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:52,080
We can't pay for it, my child, we cannot.

738
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,130
If you want to give Me a flower, all right.

739
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:59,040
It’s just an expression of your love, and that’s all.

740
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:03,210
But you can’t purchase Me. You can’t.

741
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,200
Your love can purchase Me, all right, that’s different.

742
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,130
But you can’t purchase Me with metal and money,

743
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:13,030
can you? What is a Rolls Royce?

744
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,070
I mean I don’t know what are all these crowns and

745
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,010
things. What are they good for?

746
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,220
They don’t give you joy. Go and ask the people who

747
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,090
wear the crowns.

748
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,120
The other day I was with Mrs. Thatcher.

749
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,030
Poor thing, she was so miserable. Yes, she was!

750
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:33,230
You know I tried to sort of put her down, her vibrations.

751
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,230
She was very miserable. We were just across the table

752
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,160
talking to each other.

753
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,180
And what I was doing was to balance her - poor thing,

754
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:44,040
she was very, she’s very upset.

755
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:47,220
So, you must understand, you are too simple people,

756
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:51,110
you are seekers of ancient times.

757
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,190
You are not seekers of today,

758
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,050
you are seekers of ancient times.

759
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,160
And this time has been promised to you before, also.

760
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,170
And now you have to find it.

761
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:05,190
Now you must keep your logic straight forward.

762
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,020
I mean anybody who asks for Rolls Royce,

763
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:11,230
I mean this is one of the stark examples I would say,

764
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:15,130
cannot be any guru.

765
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:19,000
It’s the starkest one, absolutely one of the …

766
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,080
But there are subtler ones.

767
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,110
He’s not so subtle.

768
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:25,230
You will get out of it in no time, I know, all of you.

769
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:29,080
But the subtler ones are even worse.

770
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:33,100
Some of them may not even ask for money.

771
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,090
May not.

772
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,120
I don’t know of any, but there may be some because

773
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:41,200
I heard about someone who doesn’t now take money,

774
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:42,210
in India.

775
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,080
He has made money here and now he’s gone to India

776
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:49,170
and he doesn’t take money from them.

777
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,060
But the one who has really not taken money,

778
00:45:54,130 --> 00:46:00,050
one person whom I know, has been using women.

779
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,000
He’s not interested in money part,

780
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:09,200
he’s using your women.

781
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,130
You see so this is what it is, you must understand.

782
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:15,190
His interest is not in your Spirit,

783
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,220
but in your purse or in your women. Imagine.

784
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:24,050
How can holiness be combined with these dirty habits of

785
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,110
people?

786
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,000
That means they themselves are under the control of their

787
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:34,180
desires which are anti-God.

788
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,100
These are all anti-God activities.

789
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,080
And you people being so simple hearted, I tell you,

790
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,160
you’re so simple hearted!

791
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,170
If you tell an Indian that a guru takes a Rolls Royce,

792
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,240
he said, “Eh.” Immediately they’ll answer.

793
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,180
They don’t want this kind. How can they?

794
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,070
Nobody will give to any guru in India.

795
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:01,070
Gurus have to pay people sometimes.

796
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:03,080
First to entice them.

797
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:05,080
Westernized Indians, it’s different;

798
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:08,110
but those who are real Indians you see they are.

799
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,090
People live with the mothers and they know what is

800
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:15,010
what. You know? Nobody can befool them,

801
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:17,220
they’re very practical people.

802
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,040
Yes, my Child?

803
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:23,030
Woman: Can you be healed through faith?

804
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:28,000
The faith is two types –

805
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:32,040
what we call in Sanskrit is Shraddha is different from

806
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,090
what you call as faith.

807
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:37,100
In English they use it as “blind faith” and another as

808
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,180
“faith.” All right? We can make it like that.

809
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:45,080
Now, the blind faith is this, that “I have got faith in God

810
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:47,100
and God will heal me.”

811
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,040
This is one faith. All right?

812
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,090
Another is a faith which is enlightened where I say

813
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,240
you are the Spirit when you are connected.

814
00:47:56,110 --> 00:48:01,100
Now, if you say that “I have faith in God”,

815
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,110
you shouldn’t feel hurt when I tell you the truth, all right?

816
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:08,240
Because if it is a blind faith means that you are not yet

817
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,240
connected with the power.

818
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,140
Not connected. See, now

819
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:18,180
supposing I start saying,  “Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ!”

820
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,230
Christ is not in my pocket.

821
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:26,140
I can’t even meet a prime minister or a queen without

822
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:30,010
having a protocol or a connection or some sort of a,

823
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:37,140
you see, position or, we can say, a authority. Isn’t it?

824
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:40,000
Now when we talk of anyone like that,

825
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,020
some people go on saying, “Rama, Rama, Rama.

826
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:45,190
Krishna, Krishna.” You see These are all Incarnations

827
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:48,230
and Christ is the Son of God,

828
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:54,030
He is the Son of a King and you just can’t meet Him.

829
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:55,100
You can’t just call Him.

830
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:59,230
He’s not at your beck and call,

831
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:03,000
He’s not your servant. All right?

832
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:06,240
Now to having faith like that when you are not

833
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:10,230
connected, if you are healed, you are healed by some

834
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:14,020
other agencies, not by Christ.

835
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:17,130
But if you are a realized soul and then you are healed,

836
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,090
then it is done by Christ.

837
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:23,000
I’ll tell you a difference,

838
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,000
a very clear cut difference of healing.

839
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,050
We have in England – we had, I don’t know now if you

840
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:32,090
have that one, it’s an organization called a

841
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:37,140
International Curative Center of Late Dr. Lang.

842
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:43,090
Now this Dr. Lang was dead, I mean he was late

843
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:46,170
but he had a curative center.

844
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,060
You see, and this gentleman died

845
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:59,020
and he possessed a man in Vietnam, a soldier,

846
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,210
not his own son but a soldier.

847
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,180
Now this soldier was told by this fellow – I mean,

848
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,020
they’re very honest people, being English,

849
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,000
they are honest and they tell the truth, you see.

850
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,240
They don’t say that “we do it through God” or anything.

851
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,160
So he told that there are many doctors

852
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,050
(I hope the doctors won’t mind) who have died and who

853
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:24,060
were very ambitious are still wanting to cure people.

854
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:27,050
And he should “Go back to my son and tell him all the

855
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:32,020
story that I’ve come in you and my son will believe.”

856
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,180
So he said, “How will he believe me?”

857
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,170
He said, “No, no. I will tell you some secrets

858
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,110
which only he and me, both of us share.

859
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:41,040
So he’ll definitely believe you.”

860
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,220
So this fellow agreed. He was a very healthy fellow,

861
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:47,080
actually this spirit entered into him when he got into a

862
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,060
sudden shock,

863
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:52,040
something he saw which shocked him in the war and this

864
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,150
spirit entered.

865
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:57,150
And he was carried by that spirit somehow or other to

866
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,100
England where he met his son

867
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,080
and he told the whole story.

868
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,210
And the son had to believe because

869
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,160
he knew so many secrets.

870
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,080
And they started this curative center.

871
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:11,000
Now how do I come to know of late Mr. Lang

872
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,030
is the thing.

873
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:20,000
They cured a lady who was in India – long time back

874
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,070
it was 1970 I’m telling you –

875
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,220
and she came to see Me, and she was all shaking,

876
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:26,090
nervous, she’s like this.

877
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,150
I said, “What’s this?”

878
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,190
She said, “I was sick with a certain disease and

879
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,200
I was afraid of an operation and I came to know about

880
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,110
this organization, I wrote to them

881
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:41,200
and they wrote to me saying that "At this time on this

882
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,130
date we’ll enter into your body."

883
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:47,040
Openly, I mean they don’t say that

884
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,150
“We are God” or anything.

885
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:51,060
“We’ll enter into your body and you’ll feel a little

886
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,230
shaking, doesn’t matter,

887
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:55,180
and you’ll sleep off and we’ll work it out.”

888
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,180
And she said, “I got cured of that disease.”

889
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,030
But after three years or so,

890
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:06,220
the whole body started shaking and she couldn’t bear it

891
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,240
anymore and she came to see Me.

892
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,070
That’s how I came to know about Dr. Lang, you see,

893
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:17,110
that he had – this poor lady was tortured for three years,

894
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,180
she suffered so much and then she came to see Me.

895
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:24,110
So after Mr. Lang entered into her body – Dr. Lang –

896
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,220
it was after six years that she came to see Me because

897
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,160
three years she was all right,

898
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,220
and after three years it started.

899
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:33,100
And that’s how I came to know all the spirits that had

900
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,240
entered into her, the doctors and all that.

901
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,000
It was a horrible case.

902
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:40,100
Of course she got cured later on, no doubt.

903
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,180
Because when you become the Spirit,

904
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:45,200
you are in your fort, nobody can enter into your body.

905
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:50,150
You become something which doesn’t get contaminated,

906
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:56,020
doesn’t get over powered, nobody can dominate.

907
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:58,000
And that’s how she got cured.

908
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:01,030
So with faith, if somebody says,

909
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,130
“Oh, you will be healed” you see

910
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:06,060
and they start shouting and screaming and this and that,

911
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:09,160
and suddenly you might feel, maybe there’s a spirit.

912
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:11,210
They replace also sometimes these spirits,

913
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,060
it’s very surprising.

914
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,200
They can replace a spirit from one to another.

915
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,170
I’ve seen such cases also.

916
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:19,150
All kinds of things I have seen in spirits.

917
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:23,200
The other day, only about eight days back, wasn’t that,

918
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:27,140
Marie, when this charismatic fellow came in?

919
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:32,220
Eight days back in France a gentleman came in.

920
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:38,030
Young fellow, must be about twenty-four or so,

921
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:44,020
he got into such a big agitation and started crying and

922
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,030
funny type of a thing that I’ve never seen a spirit enter

923
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,120
into him.

924
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:52,060
Whole body was shaking. And I mean he fell down,

925
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:56,020
he started crying, weeping, all sorts of things happened.

926
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:58,150
And he said that “I went to charismatic movement where

927
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,110
I got it.” And then they get it

928
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:02,240
and they think Holy Ghost has entered into them.

929
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,060
Now just imagine.

930
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,030
How can Holy Ghost make you miserable?

931
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:10,100
I don’t know from where these ideas come in.

932
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:13,130
And poor child, you know, he suffered so much.

933
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:14,220
Now he’s all right.

934
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:17,070
But he couldn’t believe it that you could be all right

935
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,170
because he thought … and then they say,

936
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:22,070
“These are your sins and you have to get over your sins

937
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:25,050
and this is why you are, what’s happening to you,

938
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:27,180
you still have done bad karmas, and this and that.

939
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,010
But your bad karmas and all those things can be solved

940
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,160
when the Kundalini rises.

941
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:39,170
There is a center for this specially which is really

942
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:46,040
being adorned by Jesus Christ here.

943
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:48,110
Did you tell them, about this center?

944
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,070
All right.

945
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,240
So this is the center and when the Kundalini passes

946
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:55,130
through that – that’s why they say that you have to pass

947
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,040
through it.

948
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:00,070
He gets awakened and when He gets awakened all these

949
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,160
two pouches you see there of ego and superego,

950
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,200
your conditioning and all your left sided problems

951
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,170
and right sided problems are sucked in.

952
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:12,190
That’s why they said that He died for our sins.

953
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,070
He’s described in the ancient Indian scriptures as

954
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,090
Mahavishnu but you see very –

955
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:22,020
the missionaries went to India they gave a very wrong

956
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,100
picture of Christ, absolutely wrong picture,

957
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:28,090
so they were still expecting Mahavishnu to come in.

958
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:30,000
And this is what it is.

959
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:32,000
He’s supposed

960
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,150
to be, according to missionaries, somebody who sort of

961
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:39,130
converts people and all that nonsense. See?

962
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:40,220
It’s not the real thing, that

963
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,180
He is to be awakened within you.

964
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,170
He said that. He said, “I have to be born within you.”

965
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,100
And that is what it is.

966
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:52,080
When Kundalini rises, She awakens that center within us

967
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:56,030
and all our conditionings and egos are sucked in,

968
00:55:56,150 --> 00:56:00,070
a space is created here in the fontanel bone area through

969
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,200
which the Kundalini comes in and you can feel the cool

970
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,140
breeze from your head coming out.

971
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,070
That’s what it is, and you feel it in your hands.

972
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,230
It’s not just that you’re mad after someone, you see?

973
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,040
It isn’t like that.

974
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:16,140
It’s not that way, you see,

975
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,090
nothing of that kind.

976
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:23,070
You become a self-respecting, normal, dignified

977
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:29,100
personality of great spiritual value which you are.

978
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,170
All right?

979
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:35,230
So this is what faith is and what is blind faith is.

980
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:39,110
Yes, my child.

981
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,040
Man: It seems very difficult the concept that Self

982
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,240
Realization doesn’t involve some personal effort.

983
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:53,020
Can it really come to anybody in effect of how

984
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:58,010
materialistic they are? Am I understanding this?

985
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:03,230
Yes, it appears on the face of it very difficult

986
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:08,080
and how people are materialistic is also true no doubt,

987
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:13,020
but Spirit is much stronger than the matter

988
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:14,190
and when It has to express,

989
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:20,240
It completely crushes all that and It comes.

990
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,230
Now we have here, most of you are English people,

991
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:26,240
I should say, westernized, very materialistic people they

992
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,150
are there. I should say I mean living in that world,

993
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,100
they may not have been that materialistic because if they

994
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:35,040
are not seekers, they would not come to Me.

995
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,170
But a new being has been born.

996
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:40,090
If you look at an egg you feel,

997
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,180
“Oh, what a hard stuff is this!”

998
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,090
But if it is broken at the right moment,

999
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,120
with the right understanding, it becomes a bird.

1000
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:54,040
Because a living process is all, only the last breakthrough

1001
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,200
has to take place.

1002
00:57:56,090 --> 00:58:01,050
Apparently it looks difficult, but to Me it is not.

1003
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:04,070
Perhaps I know the job.

1004
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,030
All right?

1005
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,240
Yes, it looks … many people have said all kinds of

1006
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,150
things about Kundalini, also.

1007
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:16,070
I must say some books I have seen have horrified.

1008
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,090
You see if you don’t know the job, everything –

1009
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,180
supposing if somebody else doesn’t know how to drive a

1010
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,220
car, you see, and he gets into the car

1011
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:24,190
the way he’d describe it would be horrifying.

1012
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:28,100
You’d never get near a car, isn’t it? It’s like that.

1013
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:31,040
The one who is not authorized and does not know the job

1014
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,130
should not do it.

1015
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:37,120
But that’s what happens to you, that you become

1016
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,090
the Spirit, you become your own master

1017
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,030
and you become the master of this art –

1018
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,240
the master of this art.

1019
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:47,000
Yes, my child?

1020
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,020
I couldn't hear you?

1021
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:05,240
You mentioned hypnosis earlier and You also said that

1022
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,000
You regarded Yourself as a catalyst and

1023
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:13,150
don’t You think that the hypnotist also regards himself as

1024
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:15,000
a catalyst?

1025
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:18,000
Yes, Yes no doubt.

1026
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,110
Yes, yes that’s true, but the difference is this,

1027
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,140
that the hypnotist brings you under his power,

1028
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:29,010
he doesn’t give you any power or no dimension to your

1029
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,110
awareness - you see?

1030
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:33,110
There’s a tremendous difference between the two.

1031
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:36,110
You see, you have got your own power within you.

1032
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:39,090
Say, for example, all right, your Spirit there.

1033
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:42,190
Now I’m a catalyst, you see, you can use a spoon for

1034
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,240
giving a poison or could use it for giving a nectar,

1035
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,070
all right?

1036
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,040
So if you give the nectar, then it’s a great thing;

1037
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,170
and if you give the poison, it’s horrible. It’s like that.

1038
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:59,160
Now the hypnotist uses hypnosis –

1039
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,140
how does he hypnotize is the point.

1040
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:05,200
What he does is to push you into your subconscious,

1041
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:07,120
into your collective subconscious

1042
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,070
where he overpowers you. You are under his power.

1043
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:14,070
He says, “You become like a child”, you become like a child.

1044
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:16,020
“You suck a little bottle”, you do it.

1045
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,070
What’s all this?

1046
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,190
But here you become the Spirit in the sense that you

1047
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:23,050
become collectively conscious.

1048
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:28,100
It’s no hypnosis because you, yourself, can feel it.

1049
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,020
Now, say example you take ten children

1050
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:32,060
who are realized souls.

1051
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:34,100
There are some children who are realized souls,

1052
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:36,110
even little children.

1053
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:39,030
And you take them near a person who is suffering from

1054
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,030
some trouble, all right?

1055
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,210
Now you tie up their eyes and ask them,

1056
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,200
“What’s the problem of this gentleman?”

1057
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,090
They will raise the same fingers, all of them

1058
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:52,040
will raise the same fingers and say, “This is burning”,

1059
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,170
you see, because the sensation you feel – of burning,

1060
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,030
of numbness or of cool breeze,

1061
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:04,090
a new awareness of a vibratory nature is born within you.

1062
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,090
Not with hypnosis, on the contrary, after hypnosis you

1063
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:10,220
feel so tired and finished as if somebody has been riding

1064
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,160
your horse.

1065
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,160
It’s just the other way around.

1066
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:18,240
And you start growing into you and understanding,

1067
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,230
you can cure people you understand what are the centers

1068
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,070
that are catching,

1069
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:26,110
you understand what are the centers of another person

1070
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,240
that are catching.

1071
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,150
In the beginning sometimes people have confusion, I've seen,

1072
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,040
that they don’t know “whether these are my

1073
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:34,130
centers or your centers.”

1074
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,080
Now we have ways and methods by which you can

1075
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,180
discriminate.

1076
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:39,180
You can see which are your centers catching and which

1077
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:41,210
are the centers the other person catching.

1078
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:45,140
You also know how to get them all right,

1079
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,070
you also know how to give Realization to others,

1080
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,130
and to empower them with their own powers.

1081
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:55,140
It’s just the opposite.

1082
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:58,030
But catalyst could be horrifying,

1083
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:02,240
and catalyst could be just heavenly.

1084
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:11,140
Question: Can some people

1085
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,230
Self Realize themselves with their own effort?

1086
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,130
With their own effort?

1087
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,240
I don’t think it’s possible, you see, because

1088
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,240
like a light which is enlightened can only enlighten

1089
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:26,140
another light.

1090
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:31,110
But what I’m saying, that even supposing like Buddha,

1091
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,200
you see, He got His Realization when He was

1092
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,050
absolutely tired and He had to have it.

1093
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:38,140
Of course the Holy Ghost did that. He could not have

1094
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:39,230
done it on Him,

1095
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:44,180
but He got the Realization there because it was a

1096
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:47,180
different circumstance which He had to live,

1097
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,080
He didn’t have to talk about God,

1098
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:51,190
He didn’t have to talk about the whole thing,

1099
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:56,150
because people were so much engaged in talking of big

1100
01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:01,100
things like God and about all kind of deities, this, that,

1101
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:03,070
there was a big confusion.

1102
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,030
And somebody was to be Realized at that time

1103
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:08,080
who would just localize it and say, “Only Self

1104
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:11,230
Realization – don’t talk of God or anything, forget it.”

1105
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:14,090
That’s why He got Realization like that.

1106
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:17,060
But you cannot get Realization just like that –

1107
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,090
only possession you can get. You cannot.

1108
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:24,100
Somebody who is an enlightened soul,

1109
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:28,130
such an enlightened soul doesn’t take money from you.

1110
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:31,120
Normally, you see, people don’t want to give you Relization -

1111
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,230
ninety-nine percent of those who are really realized,

1112
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:36,030
they’ll throw stones at you,

1113
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,040
they won’t have anything to do because their experiences

1114
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,080
of human beings are horrifying.

1115
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:43,100
If you go and talk to them, they’ll tell Me, they told Me

1116
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:45,040
that “Wait for twelve years.

1117
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,140
See, Mother, they will all finish You off, they’ll kill You,

1118
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,090
they’ll do this.”

1119
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,190
It’s very venturesome to deal with human beings because

1120
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:56,150
they’ll be very egoistical and they will never accept you.

1121
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,240
But if you take like this, like

1122
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:07,060
somebody who knows is a help, isn’t it?

1123
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:12,160
And Realization is not possible, is not possible to be

1124
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:15,090
done by yourself.

1125
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:19,200
It’s not possible, because if a, say, a candle which is not

1126
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:22,070
enlightened wants to get itself enlightened,

1127
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:25,210
the light has to be brought, isn’t it?

1128
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:27,220
It’s so simple like that.

1129
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:30,200
But one should not feel bad about it, actually.

1130
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,160
See, I don’t know how to drive, somebody drove Me down here.

1131
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:37,190
I didn’t feel bad that he had to drive Me down, did I?

1132
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:39,190
And I only know one job.

1133
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,180
I don’t know many.

1134
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,120
Many jobs I don’t know, I don’t know how to operate

1135
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,030
bank, I don’t know how to write a check,

1136
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,200
I’m hopeless in many things.

1137
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:50,010
I don’t know how to open a can, maybe.

1138
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,100
But I know how to open the Kundalini. All right?

1139
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,020
So if I know one job, why should you mind?

1140
01:04:56,020 --> 01:05:00,100
After all, we depend on each other for everything, isn't it?

1141
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,120
So why not, if I know the job, what’s the harm?

1142
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:06,110
And you will know, too.

1143
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:08,040
You will know, too.

1144
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:10,200
But it cannot be done by yourself.

1145
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:15,230
But actually in this you’re not obliged for anything.

1146
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:21,060
I just do it because I love it.

1147
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:23,100
It’s just emits, I don’t do anyway, I’m just flowing,

1148
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,090
I don’t know how it happens, just it’s flowing.

1149
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:37,080
I just love for love’s sake.

1150
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:39,160
You can’t believe such a person can exist,

1151
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:42,210
but I do really, I am like that.

1152
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:45,130
Sometimes you might even, some of the Sahaja Yogis

1153
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:48,220
do feel that I’m too compassionate and that I should be

1154
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:51,090
rather strict with people and things like that, you see.

1155
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:55,180
They come and tell Me some wisdom about it.

1156
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,190
You see they think I’m not so practical,

1157
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,100
but this is the most practical thing.

1158
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:09,010
Yes, I know they make mistakes because they

1159
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,200
don't know they are walking in darkness.

1160
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,160
If you are walking in darkness, you will bang at something.

1161
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,210
Then only thing you can do is to have compassion for

1162
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:20,210
them because they can’t see, they are blind. Isn’t it?

1163
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:25,040
How can you have any anger or temper?

1164
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:37,170
And moreover, I would request you not to have any

1165
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:41,000
misidentification with anyone whatsoever.

1166
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:44,140
You have to get to your Spirit, that’s the main thing.

1167
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,120
If you still think of somebody, you see,

1168
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,140
like the lady – I don’t know, somebody might have sent

1169
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:52,070
her here, maybe. I don’t know why she got angry.

1170
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:54,200
I didn’t say anything to hurt her.

1171
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,230
May be she is possessed.

1172
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:59,000
I don’t know why she has got angry with Me,

1173
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:01,070
and she just got up and just walked off saying that

1174
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:03,020
“You’re telling everything lies.”

1175
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:07,110
Why should I tell you lies?

1176
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,170
I don’t have to get anything out of you.

1177
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:14,000
But why it happens?

1178
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,200
Because she’s not sensitive,

1179
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:19,030
she’s not sensitive to Divinity.

1180
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:22,040
She doesn’t understand who’s Divine, who’s...

1181
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:25,110
I don’t blame her.

1182
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:27,140
She hasn’t got the sensitivity. It’s a caliber.

1183
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:30,060
I have seen Sahaja Yogis now of different varieties

1184
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,170
have come to Me.

1185
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,150
Some of them are of such a caliber you can’t even believe.

1186
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:36,100
They get into Realization, they know what it is,

1187
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:38,090
they have the pattern just like a diamond,

1188
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:40,030
they get it and they get to it.

1189
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:42,130
They’re tremendous people.

1190
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,080
There are some who slog behind.

1191
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:51,010
Some of them who get Realization but still

1192
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,010
they go on doubting. All kinds.

1193
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:58,150
Doesn’t matter. I love all of them.

1194
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:02,020
Yes, my child?

1195
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:21,030
He is a Sahaja yogi?

1196
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:38,150
If before Realization we were such a horrible person that

1197
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,070
we gave cancer to everybody we met or something like

1198
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:47,020
this, after Realization does the effects of that get taken

1199
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,050
away, or what happens?

1200
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:53,030
Yah. I know it, so many things have happened.

1201
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,110
We had somebody in Brighton, you remember –

1202
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:59,010
he’s here right now, I think –

1203
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,070
who was drunk when he came in.

1204
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,140
He was very angry with Me, you see, to begin with.

1205
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:06,150
He said, “How can I get rid of this trouble?

1206
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:08,090
I can’t believe You”, and all that.

1207
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:10,170
And he’s all right, perfectly all right.

1208
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,130
His change is so beautiful, you can’t… is he there?

1209
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:15,080
Yogi: Yes , I am.

1210
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,210
May God bless you.

1211
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:22,180
He’s so sweet now.

1212
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:25,090
The other day he came to see Me.

1213
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:28,230
I said, “Look at that. He’s so sweet.”

1214
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,190
He was a very sweet man, wasn’t he?

1215
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:36,160
But something had put him up, made him upset, you see,

1216
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:39,110
that he became alcoholic, you see.

1217
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,130
He’s all right.

1218
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,140
The compassion can only make you understand that

1219
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:47,160
there’s a reason for this –

1220
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:52,040
He is a very sweet person, very sweet person no doubt.

1221
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,020
But something had gone wrong with him.

1222
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,120
It’s all right.

1223
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:01,180
So this happens, it’s true.

1224
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:05,040
Sahaja Yogis realize this.

1225
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:09,030
Some, of course, I must say, go little bit.

1226
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:12,140
Doesn’t matter. They’ll come up, all of them will come,

1227
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:15,160
I’m sure of it.

1228
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:21,240
Everyone is made for it.

1229
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:25,040
Actually, the Divine is anxious to give you Realization –

1230
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:29,110
much more, much more anxious than you are.

1231
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,080
If there were thousand people today,

1232
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,240
I would have given them Realization better.

1233
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:36,180
But very few people take to reality, you see now.

1234
01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:39,150
That guru maharaji, thousands are like mad after him,

1235
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,110
isn’t it?

1236
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:46,120
He’s given nothing to the poor people.

1237
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:51,020
But for reality, there are very few.

1238
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,150
Like other day somebody asked Me a question,

1239
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,190
“Mother, why don’t You do it to everyone?”

1240
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:00,050
I said, “Where are they, everyone?

1241
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:03,070
They are busy. Where are they?

1242
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:06,200
In this Brighton, how many there are?

1243
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,200
How many are here?

1244
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,140
All right? That’s the problem.

1245
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:18,100
It takes time for people to love reality. Time.

1246
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,220
It’s such a beautiful thing.

1247
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:25,060
And even they get realized, then they drop out, you see.

1248
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,030
They say, “Oh, I’m all right now. I’m all right.”

1249
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:30,020
After one year they’ll appear.

1250
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:31,140
That’s not the way.

1251
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,160
You have to master this art, absolutely master it.

1252
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,150
It is all free, absolutely free.

1253
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:42,070
Now they are all sitting down here, they can say that.

1254
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:46,130
Would You talk a bit more about Self Realization and

1255
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:49,150
what’s necessary to enhance that.

1256
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:54,230
Yes, Yes, I will be in my next lecture, one by one.

1257
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,180
Now I’m talking the left side, the right side,

1258
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,130
and then the center, and then also, of course,

1259
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:01,190
about the Spirit.

1260
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,110
Definitely, hundred times, that’s what I have to do.

1261
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:07,100
But gradually I have to build you up. All right?

1262
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:09,020
I will definitely. You won’t believe,

1263
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:14,090
I think I have given five hundred lectures already

1264
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:17,190
in London, at least. And it doesn’t end.

1265
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:19,180
Every time, they say last time I spoke they said,

1266
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:21,210
“Mother it was absolutely a new dimension

1267
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:23,200
You talked about”, you see.

1268
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:26,000
I don’t know, Kerry told Me first time he touched his

1269
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:27,230
vibrations so much with my lecture

1270
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:31,160
I don’t know what I touched him so much.

1271
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,120
Yes, it’s surprising.

1272
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:35,150
He’s from Australia.

1273
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:40,070
Australians do well. Very fast work.

1274
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:44,080
So, all the questions are over now? Should we have it?

1275
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:48,040
What are karmas?

1276
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:55,070
Karmas are when you do any work or anything with your

1277
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:58,240
right side action then

1278
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:04,020
the effects of that accumulate within you as an ego

1279
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:05,200
because you think you are doing it.

1280
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,210
Actually, we don’t do anything substantial.

1281
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,190
What we do is a dead work like as I said we make a chair

1282
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:14,090
out of a dead, a tree.

1283
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:16,230
That’s all we do. What work we do is an idea we have

1284
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:18,060
we are doing work.

1285
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,140
What work are you doing?

1286
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:21,230
Can you convert this into a fruit?

1287
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:25,030
We can’t even put fragrance into it.

1288
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:28,210
So this myth, you see, works as ego within us as shown

1289
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,210
here, which I will be speaking tomorrow about, all right?

1290
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:34,200
And this is what is that we think we are doing this work,

1291
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:39,030
that work, and this ego thinks that if you have done bad

1292
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,240
work or good work we have to suffer.

1293
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:45,170
You see, a tiger doesn’t feel that way.

1294
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:48,200
If tiger has to eat, it must kill.

1295
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,220
It kills the animal, eats it, finished.

1296
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,180
It doesn’t sit down and sulk, “Oh, God, I shouldn’t have

1297
01:13:55,020 --> 01:14:00,120
done it. I should become vegetarian.”

1298
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:05,040
It doesn’t accumulate any, any, any karmas in it,

1299
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,180
all right? But we human beings do. Why?

1300
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:10,030
Because we are closed.

1301
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,170
We are closed. See here, we are closed.

1302
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,050
They are open.

1303
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:16,060
Whatever they do, they are not bothered.

1304
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,070
But we are bothered about what we do

1305
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:20,140
because we think we do.

1306
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,080
And when, as I said, this center is opened out

1307
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:30,070
He sucks our karmas, and the so-called karmas are

1308
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:33,000
nothing but sins, you see –

1309
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:36,140
in a biblical language we can call it as sin, you see.

1310
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:39,110
And they’re all sucked in

1311
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:45,240
by this powerful Deity of Christ awakened within us.

1312
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,130
And you get beyond it because

1313
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:49,180
it is the ego that does the karma.

1314
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:53,090
When your ego is finished, where are the karmas?

1315
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:56,020
They are finished, too.

1316
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,220
Then you don’t say, “I did it.”

1317
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:06,050
What you will say, “Mother, it’s not working out.

1318
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:08,130
It’s not going up.” Now what is this “it” –

1319
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:11,200
it becomes a third person. “It’s flowing.

1320
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,100
The vibrations not coming.”

1321
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:16,190
You see, you don’t say, “I, I am doing this Realization.

1322
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:19,180
I am raising the kunda ..”, they don’t say so.

1323
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:25,110
They say, “It’s not rising.” You become a third person.

1324
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,220
That third person is the Spirit.

1325
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:31,050
Where you do not say that “I should do it.”

1326
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,030
Even if it’s your son, you say,

1327
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,050
“Mother, it’s better he gets Realization.”

1328
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:39,020
All right. You’ll see. Try it. It didn’t work out?

1329
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,220
All right, then should I give a certificate?

1330
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:43,110
He said, “How can You give certificate,

1331
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:46,080
Mother, how can anybody, Kundalini has not risen.”

1332
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,120
Everyone knows, you see, whether it’s your father,

1333
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,040
mother, sister - anyone –

1334
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:52,090
if they’re not realized, they know they’re not realized,

1335
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:56,190
so what. They just know.

1336
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:00,000
This granddaughter of Mine, who was …

1337
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:03,120
she’s here now, she is a born realized,

1338
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,100
and she was hardly about five years of age, I think,

1339
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:06,240
when they went to Ladakh.

1340
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,160
There was one lama sitting with a shaved head and all

1341
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:11,100
that, wearing and all that.

1342
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:14,000
Everybody was touching his feet, and the parents also

1343
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:16,230
not realized, my daughter is not realized, so she also

1344
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:18,000
touched his feet.

1345
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:19,140
She couldn’t bear it anymore now,

1346
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:20,180
it was too much for her.

1347
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:23,070
She was sitting in a higher block, she went,

1348
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:26,030
put her hands back and looked at him, you see, told him.

1349
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:29,010
She says, “What do you mean by asking everybody to

1350
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:33,030
touch your feet? You’re not a even a realized soul.

1351
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:36,020
By wearing this dress of yours and shaving your head

1352
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:39,060
you think you can ask people to touch your feet?”

1353
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:44,060
Little child of five years, yet she understands.

1354
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:47,120
We had once a program in India when they invited Me

1355
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,070
as a chief guest and for this Ramanmash?,

1356
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:54,020
she was a realized soul; and one gentleman from

1357
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,020
Ramkrishna ashram from the head of that was sitting

1358
01:16:56,140 --> 01:17:01,070
with his big orange robe, you see, sitting there.

1359
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:03,040
And my, another granddaughter,

1360
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:05,010
she was sitting in the front row.

1361
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,130
She couldn’t bear him anymore

1362
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:08,030
so she shouted from there,

1363
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:12,050
“Mother, the one whose wearing a maxi dress,

1364
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,000
Grandmother, please ask him to get out,

1365
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,240
he’s giving heat to all of us.”

1366
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:17,180
So you see, there were many Sahaj Yogis who were

1367
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,150
feeling the heat from this fellow and he thinks he’s a

1368
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:20,240
very spiritual man.

1369
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:24,020
She said, “Ask him to go, he’s wearing a maxi.”

1370
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,200
She didn’t understand it was a robe or thing.

1371
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:29,080
Even children know

1372
01:17:29,170 --> 01:17:31,220
who are realized souls and who are not,

1373
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:33,100
if they are born realized.

1374
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,130
There are many children who are born realized these days.

1375
01:17:35,190 --> 01:17:40,000
The time of judgment, this is the time of judgment.

1376
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,240
Of course about this I’ll tell you later.

1377
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,090
Do You mind if I ask You a few questions?

1378
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:52,140
It’s all right, I don’t mind.

1379
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:54,100
But what happens, if you ask too many questions

1380
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:58,090
sometimes it becomes mental activity and may delay

1381
01:17:58,190 --> 01:18:00,140
further Realization sometimes,

1382
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:03,150
so I would advice you, if it is not so important, better

1383
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:06,100
keep it out because, you see, answering the question is

1384
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:08,020
only on mental level.

1385
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:10,040
I’m talking something much beyond, you see.

1386
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:14,010
So, it is something logically if you have understood Me -

1387
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,210
all right, let’s have it.

1388
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,240
If it will work out, work out. If it will not work out,

1389
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,020
doesn’t matter.

1390
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:22,180
I’m here for three-four days, and we are going to work it

1391
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:24,100
out. All right?

1392
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,160
So it’s better to keep your mind at rest. Tell the mind,

1393
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:28,210
“You have asked many questions before,

1394
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:32,200
you have thought of many things, now the time for you

1395
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:39,050
to receive the blessings of your own being.” All right?

1396
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:41,000
If you tell your mind, it will rest.

1397
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:44,170
It’s a, it’s a wonderful thing mind is.

1398
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:50,030
If the mind knows what you want, and if it is the reality,

1399
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:53,060
it supports you and helps you very much.

1400
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:56,080
The same mind which can go astray, you see,

1401
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,170
it’s like sometimes I say it’s like a donkey,

1402
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:04,130
like Christ used donkey just to suggest the mind

1403
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:10,140
that if you allow it to go astray it will take you to all

1404
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:14,050
kinds of things, but if you control it, it takes you there

1405
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:17,040
where you have to go.

1406
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:20,020
You just make him keep quiet.

1407
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:23,100
It’s better to keep quiet at mind level.

1408
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:26,050
And that’s why I answered your questions because later

1409
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,090
on when the Kundalini’s rising, at that time,

1410
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:31,160
the mind should not stand up, isn’t it, to say that

1411
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:34,050
“I haven’t asked this question.” That’s why.

1412
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:36,090
Just to soothe it – there’s no need –

1413
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:39,230
but, just to soothe it down, I do it. All right?

1414
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:42,090
So best thing is to get your Realization is the best thing,

1415
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:45,030
otherwise this mind is quite a disturbing stuff.

1416
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:47,160
It can come at the right time when you are going to

1417
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:52,100
achieve your last breakthrough, it may stop. All right?

1418
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:55,170
So if you have any immediate question by which you are

1419
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,170
really oppressed then you must ask Me.

1420
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,050
But if it is not so important, just give up.

1421
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,230
Is it very important?

1422
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:04,030
Then it’s all right. He has realized.
