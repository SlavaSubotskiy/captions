1
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,510
So many questions, you see... Now, most of
the questions are coming from people who doubt.

2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:19,510
Can you translate it? In Sahaja Yoga best
thing is to practice what is said and then

3
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,730
see for yourself, but if they're coming I
would like to tell them about it.

4
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:47,219
Now the first one is about vegetarianism,
somebody's asked. Who has asked about vegetarianism?

5
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:03,149
Raise your hand. Ah, you, all right. Now,
I said that there should be, there is no question

6
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:13,350
of vegetarianism; whether you are a vegetarian
or not makes no difference to your meditation.

7
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:21,610
But for people, you see, the food is only
important because supposing you're Chinese,

8
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,280
you eat too much of fish and all that. So
to give it a balance, if you become a vegetarian

9
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,700
more you'd be better.

10
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,700
It's a question of balancing, but those people
who eat too much of, say, vegetarians, like

11
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:43,509
in India, they should take more to non-veg,
or to proteins; it's a question of carbohydrates

12
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:49,479
and proteins, it's not question of vegetarianism.
Now to say that Buddha was vegetarian is not

13
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:56,479
true; it's false. Because how Buddha died,
you know? Buddha died when he went to a disciple

14
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,520
who had killed a wild boar, and the wild boar
is allowed to leave for some time and then

15
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:14,189
you should eat the meat. But he was in a hurry,
so they didn't do that and he ate it and he

16
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,640
died.

17
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:20,669
Now the problem with all of you is one, always,
like whether you're Christians or Buddhists

18
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:25,540
or anything, you're all conditioned background.
To you Buddha is everything. What did Buddha

19
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:32,540
do for you? Where is he? What is he doing?
What did he do for the Buddhists? Did he give

20
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,389
you Realization? But you all are like that,
even the Christians are like that. They're

21
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:43,389
so much conditioned by Christ. You see, they
are either Christ or Mohammad Sahib or someone

22
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,250
like that, but I'm sitting before you. They're
not here. Who has given you Realization? Try

23
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,470
to understand.

24
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:58,010
So why be so much conditioned by Buddha? Buddha
was never, never was a vegetarian; he died

25
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:04,709
because of that. He ate that meat and he died;
so it's a wrong idea that Buddha was a vegetarian.

26
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:11,570
It's all myths they're going about and there
is no need to be vegetarian; if you are suffering

27
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:17,760
from too much of protein intake you should
take to vegetarianism. It's good for you if

28
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,130
you have that problem, and in China eat so
much of, say, fish. So they should take more

29
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:30,190
vegetables with it, not only the fish because
with fish you have phosphorous.

30
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,199
Now do you know about your genes, we have
a database of the genes. There are three things,

31
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:42,199
carbohydrates, there is phosphorous and there
is nitrogen. Nitrogen is good for your health,

32
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:49,440
for your ascent, for everything. But what
happens? People eat too much of proteins and

33
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,630
fish and all that; then they create more phosphorous,
they become very right-sided, their eyes are

34
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:04,630
spoilt and the whole balance is lost. Do you
follow the point? The balance is lost; so

35
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:12,090
what you have to do... So the people who are
eating too much of phosphorous must take to

36
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:24,259
carbohydrates. So it will suit some people
who are eating too much of proteins or too

37
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:31,240
much of phosphorous should take to more vegetarian
food, will help; but it's not the way we should

38
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,240
judge it we start by taking vegetarianism
will become a realized soul, you cannot.

39
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,890
Some people it will improve the meditation,
with some people it will not. For example

40
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,540
Me, I can't take vegetarian food for more
than two days, I get diarrhea, <inaudible

41
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,390
> sympathetic. I just get diarrhea, I cannot
eat. I cannot also eat all the time fish,

42
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:04,390
I have to eat a very much of protein food.
You see for the Goddess they offered a lamb

43
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:12,560
or sometimes a goat, this is the reason She
has to take proteins. This is what it is that

44
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:20,480
She has to take proteins, and somebody has
to take, say, more of carbohydrates, they

45
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:27,480
should take. But it doesn't suit everyone.

46
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:38,790
"We learn that several gurus in Hong Kong..."
Who is this Sarah Lee? All right. "We learn

47
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,680
that several gurus in Hong Kong promote their
exegeses free of charge and promise the followers

48
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,390
that they can get rid of their karma once
they give their faiths to their guru as they

49
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:05,390
are also promoting internal peace and transcendence
and they do not charge for anything. What

50
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:13,040
are they aiming at?" They're just aiming at
controlling you. Just they want to control

51
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,120
some people, that's all; it's a power game,
and that's what they want to do, it's a power

52
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,450
game. And I'm sure at certain point they must
be taking money also. Now the thing is if

53
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,970
they were giving peace and they're talking
about karma.

54
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:32,180
I'm not talking of karma. I'm saying you've
to go beyond your mind and it has to be connected

55
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,810
with scientific ideas, that you have to go
beyond your mind. They never say like this,

56
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,400
"We'll get rid of your karmas." How can you?
Who does the karma? Ask them. Ask them five

57
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,630
questions, they'll be all right. They don't
know about ego, they don't know about conditioning,

58
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:53,440
they don't know about chakras, nothing they
know. They might be cheating you just, I mean

59
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,600
it's just anybody can start something like
that but what is the validity. Validity is

60
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,770
that do they talk relevantly, do they talk
about the inner side, do they talk about the

61
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,830
chakras, do they talk about the Kundalini?
Now you have got your Kundalini awakened;

62
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:15,419
that should give you faith not in Me but in
yourself. You have no faith in yourself, that's

63
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:19,669
why you start thinking like this. If you have
faith in your achievements, what you have

64
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:26,669
achieved through Sahaja Yoga, you won't ask
such questions. All right, so this is over...

65
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:37,200
There's somebody, a new yogini, she said she
cannot believe in her own feelings. Who's

66
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:51,710
this one, from Japan? Now see, there's nothing
to believe in your own feelings, no question.

67
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:07,180
You have to believe in your vibrations. You
should see what sort of vibrations you get.

68
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:14,949
Supposing you are very much inclined for something.
So try to find out of someone, try to find

69
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,120
out on your vibrations, you can find out whether
it is true or not. Because now you have jumped

70
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:29,120
into an awareness where you know the absolute
but it's not necessary that you have reached

71
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:35,500
that state. But I'll tell you how to reach
that state, it's different but just now as

72
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:41,200
it is, you have to go beyond your mind. And
that is what one has to achieve, all right?

73
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:48,200
So how to go beyond your mind, that I'll tell
you.

74
00:08:53,970 --> 00:09:00,970
Now who's Pamela Ng? All right, well, she
says that when she came first to meditation

75
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:20,390
she was sleeping very well, it was effective
after, and all that and then later on she

76
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:26,050
started... Now see, look, if you are just
thinking about yourself, vibrations will go

77
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:32,650
away. It's not given only for your benefit,
it's given for the benefit of everyone. If

78
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:38,550
you're just worried about yourself the vibrations
will disappear. Because vibrations are there

79
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,550
to give it to others, to work for others.
If you're not collective enough, you cannot

80
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:50,550
grow. If you do not dissolve into Sahaja Yoga
you cannot grow. And then when you don't grow

81
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,950
you go on falling down; you go on falling
down, then you'll lose all these things. So

82
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:03,950
how many people have you given Realization?
That's it. First you start giving Realizations

83
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:12,320
to others then you will understand that how
joyous it is to give Realization. It's not

84
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,320
meant for you alone, it's meant for everyone,
all right?

85
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:26,350
"I believe that there are real gurus and false
gurus in this world. If someone follows a

86
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:33,950
real guru but not Sahaja Yoga does this still
do any good for him?" Who's this Christine?

87
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:42,490
Now see, I haven't met anybody who's a real
guru and who is giving Realization to others,

88
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:49,100
who may be real but he cannot give Realization.
That's the point. So what will they do? You

89
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:56,100
see, they're very hot-tempered people mostly
and they take you to task; they make you work

90
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:03,360
very hard. I haven't seen anybody giving Realization
so far; if you meet anyone, let Me know <laughter>.

91
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:15,930
I'll be very happy, pass on.

92
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:23,490
Mr. Ling, who's he? Now, this is interesting,
the way you're seeing visions. Have you been

93
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:35,770
to some other master before? No one? No? Now,
you see, for this, best thing is to know about

94
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:44,410
Tao which is your speciality, it's Chinese
in which he describes, you see, Tao; Lao Tzu

95
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:52,890
describes the journey through the river Yangtze.
I've been Myself to see that. So he says on

96
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:59,890
the side or the banks there are beautiful,
very beautiful mountains and beautiful trees

97
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:08,279
and it's so beautiful that you feel like jumping
out of the boat and going to the, these gardens

98
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:16,230
and these mountains. But what your aim is
to go through this, Tao, means the Yangtze

99
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,820
river, towards the river. In the beginning,
maybe there are some currents flowing, maybe

100
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:30,510
you might lose faith in yourself. But by the
time you reach near the sea, it becomes very

101
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:37,510
silent and you have to go to the sea, that's
the point is. So, you see, all these are there;

102
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,990
these are just enticing... It's all right
you see but it's nothing important because

103
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,540
all these will keep you on a mental level.
You'll be always thinking, "What is this vision?

104
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:53,540
What is that?" There's nothing to be on the
mental level, you have to beyond, all right?

105
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,160
If you don't see, you don't bother about it,
they'll disappear.

106
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,800
These questions are nice. The first one is
about confidence, you see and I'm going to

107
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,230
tell you about meditation. If you do that
kind of meditation you'll get back your confidence,

108
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:10,230
all right? That's one point. And then he says
if there's anything like destiny. In Sahaja

109
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:17,610
Yoga you decide your destiny, you don't have
to depend on any destiny. Then it's true that

110
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:24,610
in Hong Kong is highly polluted and lot of
people get allergies and things like that.

111
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:30,029
But Sahaja Yogis should take bandhans so they
won't suffer with any allergies or anything.

112
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:35,990
And also you can use something to cover your
nose or something. I know people are smoking

113
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:42,519
so much I Myself, I absorb so much of this
within Myself, but this will all go away as

114
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:49,519
far as you are concerned because you're protected,
all right? But the first one I'll tell you

115
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,040
later.

116
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Werner, where's Werner? Now your eyes are
suffering. So very simple is that... All right

117
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:37,230
now what you have to do... What is your digestion
problem? You get diarrhea? Constipation. What

118
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:03,500
is your digestion problem? Digestion, what
is it? He's already right-sided. You're very

119
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:11,810
right-sided person, you see and your eye trouble
also come from the same. For the eye trouble

120
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:17,610
that you are doing you have to put ice here,
on the left hand side from here to here, and

121
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:24,610
also on your liver, all right? And your right-sidedness
has to go, that I'll tell you how to do it,

122
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,910
all right?

123
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:46,910
This is a nice idea, that they come to your
program and then they come to puja and then

124
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:52,779
they disappear. It's all right, now what can
you do about it? There's no choice, if they

125
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:59,779
want to disappear let them go away. We cannot
force them, but maybe, maybe some of the people

126
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:07,750
do not have proper behavior towards them,
maybe. So you have to be careful how you talk

127
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:14,750
to them and how you approach them. You should
not be aggressive with them and all that.

128
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:20,559
Maybe some of the reasons could be that. So
that's very common, you see, they come and

129
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,659
they go away. Because this is the time of
Last Judgment. If they want to go to false

130
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:32,659
guru let them go because this is their choice.
You don't have to worry on that point. But

131
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:41,149
I think sometimes, sometimes they leave because
they do not do meditation properly, and I'll

132
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:49,379
tell you what is to be done properly.

133
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:59,879
All right, now we have to go beyond the mind,
as I said it that mind is a myth and we live

134
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:17,190
on a mental level all the time. And that's
why so many questions and so many things they

135
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,730
come from your mind. If you reach a state
where you are beyond the mind you won't have

136
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:28,159
any questions because you will be there. Because
you're not there you're asking these questions.

137
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:33,289
You are there for a short time and then you
come down. So how to be more on that level,

138
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:39,859
I'll tell you. I don't have that problem.
I can be all the time beyond the mind but

139
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:46,859
for you people I've tried to find out why,
how to make it, to keep you beyond the mind.

140
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:54,359
Now the best way I told people and it has
worked wonders that when you are, wherever

141
00:18:54,359 --> 00:19:00,539
you are free, whether you are meditating or
not, wherever you are freely standing or doing,

142
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:05,330
try to see what is your mind is thinking.
You separate, now because you're realized

143
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:10,230
souls, you have to be, first of all, connected;
if you're not connected you can't do this

144
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:17,230
practice. But if you're connected to the mains
then what you should do is to see that your

145
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:24,720
mind is thinking. Now watch your mind. Ask
the mind, "Now what are you thinking? Let's

146
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,379
see, what are we to think?" And you will be
surprised you'll go on watching and suddenly

147
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:32,690
you'll reach a point that you have become
thoughtless.

148
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:39,340
So always watch the mind. What is it doing?
What is it thinking? What is it working out?

149
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:46,340
And the mind will just not think because it
cannot answer. It cannot answer a realized

150
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:55,460
soul, you see. But for that, you have to be
beyond the mind; to begin with you should

151
00:19:56,149 --> 00:20:03,149
separate yourself from your mind. You ask
questions to your mind. "Now let's see what

152
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:09,359
are you thinking, sir. Where are you?" In
the mirror also you can see, you shouldn't

153
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:16,359
suffer from narcissism, of course not, but
what you have to do is to ask.

154
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:52,070
You see, if you try to understand how to become
thoughtless, the best way is to look at something,

155
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:11,999
now you look at something, say, look at the
flowers. Now immediately it will react, your

156
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:16,149
mind will react. Now you try to see what is
your mind is saying. "I don't want to hear,

157
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:23,149
no, I don't want to hear." Just say, "I don't
want to hear anything. I don't want to know

158
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:29,729
anything." You just want to watch, that's
all. Gradually you'll grow. You see, this

159
00:21:29,729 --> 00:21:35,850
is the system Zen. Try to do it, but it was
such a thing, you know, that time, they were

160
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,529
no such nice people like you, perhaps. So
he had to use other methods to make people

161
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:42,340
go beyond the thought.

162
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:49,070
For example, I was telling just now about
the tea ceremony. For tea ceremony, he would

163
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:56,070
take a bowl of, say, freak, like a freak.
Freak, you understand the freak? Freak is

164
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:10,220
a thing which comes out by nature naturally
in the cooking. When it is fried it becomes

165
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:18,450
very funny type; that is the freak. It's not
regular. It's only one piece or something.

166
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:30,070
Somebody who's Japanese here, who's come from
Japan? You? You people, they like, that's

167
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:37,070
why freak very much, you see. So, what he
said that it is... , you take the bowl in

168
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:46,200
your hand for tea ceremony, that's the best.
So first of all, you sit in a garden, with

169
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:54,249
natural trees and natural fibers of the wood
and all that, sitting down. Now you start

170
00:22:54,249 --> 00:23:00,259
watching that thing, three times sitting like
this and three times like that. And don't

171
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:07,259
think, that's the point, don't think. And
then you take that tea; the tea is so sour,

172
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:14,970
so bitter, take quinine raised to the power
of hundred and eight. Once you take that,

173
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:22,649
you become absolutely thoughtless; that's
one.

174
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:28,909
Then they give you a sweet; this sweet is
also sweetness, sugar raised to the power

175
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:35,619
of hundred and eight. You just can't eat it,
so you went from one extreme to another extreme;

176
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:40,940
again you become like that, you see, it's
like standing. They put this side and that

177
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:47,940
side and suddenly it works out. But it's meant
for people who already have got Realization,

178
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:53,580
not for people who have not got. That's why
still they're studying Zen, you know, this

179
00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:00,580
tea ceremony. When we went to Japan, you see,
in one hotel, they had arranged this tea ceremony

180
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,200
and some Americans, they said one couple has
to come, they were fighting, "I'll go, I'll

181
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,639
go." We have had the experience, so we were
keeping quiet, to see what's going to happen.

182
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:15,460
And one couple came forward and knew they
were very jealous of them. They sat on the

183
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,960
stage and then they brought the tea; they
make it with a very care and all that and

184
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,960
gave it to the wife. She drank it and she
was stunned, and then they gave it to the

185
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:33,590
husband. Her husband, you know, American after
all, he got so angry he threw the bowl. He

186
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:38,979
said, "Damn it! You took so much money from
us and what are you giving us?" He gave all

187
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:43,349
kinds of American abuses to them and they
came away and everybody started beating the

188
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:46,399
people who had put up the show.

189
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:53,399
So this is meant for people who really want
to go very deep. In Zen we also made a big

190
00:24:55,179 --> 00:25:01,759
courtyard filled with sand, with some sort
of designs in the sand and they put some stones

191
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:08,759
in it. You are supposed to sit on the edge
of that and to look at it without thinking.

192
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,889
But normally people start comparing, "It looks
like ships, it looks like this, it looks like..."

193
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:20,549
No, you have to just look at it without thinking.
There're many such things he did but nothing

194
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:27,549
worked out with them. There were only twenty-six
people who got Realization in the Zen system

195
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:34,070
in the Sixth Century. From the Sixth Century
to the Twelfth Century and after that nobody

196
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:39,609
got Realization. But there were very few and
that's why they don't understand Zen at all.

197
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:45,070
You see, people write Zen because it's very
deep and they don't understand; so that's

198
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:51,190
what it is. Now Sahaja Yoga is understood,
can be understood by normally educated person,

199
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:58,190
by even uneducated people. And this happens
because actualization takes place. Your Kundalini

200
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:06,419
takes an actual ascent.

201
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:34,379
Now in Sahaja Yoga when people come in, there're
different categories of people also. Some

202
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:41,379
of them come because they think they can get
good health; once they get good health they

203
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:48,619
disappear. Then they again get some trouble,
they come back, just for good health. So you

204
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:55,619
can't help, they have very limited desires.
Then some people come in Sahaja Yoga for throwing

205
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,599
their weight around, you see, showing off
their ego, that, "I'm this," you see, trying

206
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:07,009
to make another group, another this thing.
You see, like that also some people come,

207
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:11,769
it's very common, like a politics, you see.
And they try to do it against the leader,

208
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:16,859
against this, "This is wrong with him, that
is wrong with him," and all kinds of things.

209
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:23,159
Thirdly people come but they don't come regularly
to Sahaja Yoga, they do not come regularly

210
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:29,349
to the center. They just keep aloof and after
some time they're lost. They again get some

211
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:32,029
diseases or trouble, then they come back.

212
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:38,299
So it's a religious duty of all of you to
come to the collective, one thing. The second

213
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:45,299
one is to meditate everyday in the night before
sleeping on your mind. Everywhere you go you

214
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:51,989
should be in a meditative condition, in the
sense, you should ask your mind what is it

215
00:28:51,989 --> 00:28:58,989
thinking. All should come to collective every
time they have a program wherever it is. In

216
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:08,239
Delhi you have seen people are really wonderful.
There are so many people, at least about,

217
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:15,159
I think two hundred people, of course we have
a good center there; two hundred people, every

218
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:21,299
morning they come for meditation, every morning,
look at these people. So the quality, we call

219
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:28,190
the pindah, so the quality of a person depends
on how much you want Sahaja Yoga. You just

220
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,950
want to have all the advantages, you want
to do everything.

221
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:37,549
Like this lady, Sushmita Sen, she got the
first prize, she's a Sahaja Yogini. She's

222
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:43,749
a Sahaja Yogini and she meditates everyday,
everyday she meditates and everyday she used

223
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:49,759
to come in the morning to our ashram in Delhi.
She's a great Sahaja Yogini, I must say, but

224
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:56,659
now she's in Calcutta and there also she does
the same. So the children also, some who are...;

225
00:29:56,659 --> 00:30:03,659
this girl child is very highly developed child,
this one is. I saw her yesterday, she's a

226
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:09,440
born realized, and she is the one, she must
be meditating, I'm sure. She is a very highly

227
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,099
developed person; she's got it from her last
life so she... This kind of children, there

228
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:21,279
are many who are meditating or when they go
to school also they become like that. So you

229
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:28,279
have to first of all worry about correcting
yourself.

230
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:12,219
Now, you see, also another kind of people
come in Sahaja Yoga they came, they made lots

231
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:06,039
of money, this thing, that thing, see, the
greed is on. So if you still suffer from too

232
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:15,139
much greed or hatred or you can call it pride
and aloofness and all that, then you must

233
00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:24,589
know that still you have to work out. Or if
you are very angry type or attached, some

234
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:45,049
people are very attached to their children.
So in Sahaja Yoga they learn a lesson also

235
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:52,779
from their children. So one has to be introspective
to see, "Are you just, are you satisfied?"

236
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:05,779
Then you can certify yourself that you're
all right.

237
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:13,349
There're so many types of people you'll meet
but what you have to see about your own ascent.

238
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:32,539
So I've talked about God Realization in My
last speech in this thing, so you better listen

239
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:39,539
to that lecture of Mine, for this puja, for
the Shiv Puja. So one should not even have

240
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:55,419
ambitions, when you have become a part and
parcel of the whole, when you have become

241
00:33:55,419 --> 00:34:02,419
the ocean, what is there to be ambitious?
It's all individuality. You have 
to be a satisfied soul and I would say about

242
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:23,210
Myself that I have to buy for My children,
for My husband, this thing, that thing, but

243
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:30,210
I never buy anything for Myself, very difficult,
very difficult to buy something for Myself.

244
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:49,929
And somebody says that, "Mother please what
will you have?" I don't know what to say,

245
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:58,399
what should I have. I asked My daughter, "You
make all kinds of things for your father,

246
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:08,900
what about Me?" So she said, "You don't like
something in particular, what to make for

247
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:17,050
you, you tell us."

248
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:25,130
All these attachments some people have, got
attachments to clothes, you see, "What I'll

249
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:32,130
wear tomorrow, I'll wear day after tomorrow,"
like that. But so spontaneously whatever 
is available you can wear. And some worried

250
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:47,130
about their past, you see, "I'd a bad childhood,"
this, that, and they write about their parents;

251
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:54,130
it's all nonsense, forget it, you be in the
present. Now you are no more a seed, you have

252
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:13,680
to grow. That is something one has to understand
in life; that if you have to grow ourselves

253
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:22,310
then what we have to see within ourself what
lies, whether that is doing wrong. That is

254
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:31,340
something missing.

255
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:42,870
Best is to see the good points of others,
not the bad points. By that you will gradually

256
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:54,670
develop more good points within yourself.
Competition should be in good points. So on

257
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:11,250
one side you have to achieve your self-Realization
in a way that you put yourself beyond the

258
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:18,250
mind, one way, through meditation. And the
second way is to give Realizations to others.

259
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:39,530
And must attend collective meditation, very
important. You have to be active in it. If

260
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:50,370
you are not active in Sahaja Yoga then you
lose your vibrations gradually because Divine

261
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:57,370
thinks, "What's the use of giving to this
hopeless case any vibrations." So you have

262
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,480
to work it out, understanding that now you
are chosen as the instrument of the Divine.

263
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:21,320
It is not only for your health or for the
health of your family or for anything like

264
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:32,090
that. But it is for the good of the others.
That's how you'll all go very well.

265
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:48,370
Now diffidence comes through your mind only;
mind only gives you diffidence. So to overpower

266
00:38:53,650 --> 00:39:00,650
this mind, you must watch and tell him to
shut up. Must tell him to shut up. Then you

267
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:13,940
will rise. The proof is that you feel the
vibrations. Now, if you ask Me I find the

268
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:31,920
people in Hong Kong are rather right-sided,
most of them. So you 
have to do right-sided treatment for yourself.

269
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:47,650
Every night, about ten minutes, at the most,
you have to sit with your right hand towards

270
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:54,650
the photograph and right foot in the water,
with a little salt. Normally use cold water,

271
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:09,140
ice also is good but cold water normally but
if it is very cold outside, you can use warm

272
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:16,770
water. In this hand (left hand) you must take
ice and put it on your liver, right hand towards

273
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:37,620
the photograph. Now, then after that you can
put the ice over here, put your hand there.

274
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:59,880
If you do it everyday your stress will go
down, everything will be perfect, just sit

275
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:06,880
like this, just now. Heat is going down; no,
no, no, put right hand towards Me and the

276
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:17,370
left hand there. You're left sided, you're
not right-sided; you have to use the candle

277
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:34,910
treatment, all right?

278
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Now some people have both problems. Then you
have to put a candle in front of the photograph,

279
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:54,610
put both the feet in the water and sit like
this and in 
both the cases don't close your eyes. You

280
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:13,320
should put your attention on My Agnya, it'll
be very good for you, for your ascent into

281
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:22,700
the realm of thoughtless awareness. As I love
you try to love Me, that's the best thing.

282
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:45,090
Lastly, you see, in Sahaja Yoga people come
in, they think it's a sort of a contract with

283
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:52,800
us that we should look after them, their health,
their jobs, their everything. This is absurd.

284
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:13,340
The contract is between yourself, with yourself.
You have to work it out, all right? This is

285
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:27,970
what it is. So if the mind is asking questions
ask it to shut up now. Mind is the worst thing,

286
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:57,210
it is standing between you and reality. (Shri
Mataji speaks in Hindi here.)

287
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:07,560
Now whatever it is, like yours, you see, you
give a bandhan to your husband; ask everybody

288
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:19,560
to give a bandhan to him just now, you can
give bandhan to him, her husband, Atul is

289
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:03,380
his name. Just give him a bandhan. See, it
will work out, you can help, all of you can

290
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:17,220
help. You can help the whole world but you
have to be strong, you have to have the energy

291
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:24,220
within yourself. Ha! Good, very good. This
is Sahaja Yog, it's cool. So try to remember

292
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:48,010
what is your real problem; you're right-sided,
all right so just try to cut it off.

293
00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:02,670
I'll be happy if you could learn some English
because I can't learn so many languages. Deities

294
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:15,850
only understood so far only Sanskrit but now
they understand English, thank God! <laughter>

295
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:28,190
It's a great credit for the English people.
But still English language very limited, very

296
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:51,620
limited. For example "spirit" word they will
use for the Atma, they will use it for alcohol,

297
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:02,040
also they will use it for the dead spirits.
Such a language, what can you say, what can

298
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:18,660
you explain. And the French is the worst,
French is the worst because first of 
all if 

299
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:27,140
you speak French you catch on Vishuddhi. And

300
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:47,770
also 
in French there are many words missing, of
course "spirit" is missing though, no doubt,

301
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:58,790
but 
also 

302
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:22,940
the word "awareness" is 
not there.

303
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:43,480
So now I think everybody is happy. Let's have
some music.
