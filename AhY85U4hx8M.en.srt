1
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:22,980
Today we are here to celebrate the resurrection
of Christ.

2
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:29,780
Resurrection of Christ has the greatest significance
for all the Sahaj Yogis.

3
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:38,230
And we have to understand that He resurrected
Himself so that we could resurrect ourselves.

4
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:44,230
The message of His life is His resurrection
and not His cross.

5
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:50,140
He bore the cross for us and we don’t have
to bear anymore.

6
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:57,480
I see lots of people having this drama going
on: they are carrying the cross across to

7
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,660
show as if we are going to do the job for
Christ!

8
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,720
As if He has left some work to be done by
these people who play a drama.

9
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
But all this drama is to deceive yourself
and to deceive others.

10
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:20,799
There’s no sense in playing such useless
things to show how Christ suffered.

11
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,250
To make you weep and to make you cry, Christ
did not suffer.

12
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:31,170
He suffered that you should enjoy, that you
should be happy, that you should lead a life

13
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:38,459
of complete bliss and gratitude to the Almighty
who has created you.

14
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,470
He would never like you to be unhappy.

15
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,159
Which father would like his son to be unhappy?

16
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:54,540
So we have to understand that His message
of His life, why He came on this Earth to

17
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,780
do the greatest job is that of resurrection.

18
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,099
If He had not resurrected Himself, I could
not have worked out Sahaj Yoga.

19
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:10,819
So we have to be eternally thankful to His
life and to Him, the way He did all these

20
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:14,430
difficult tasks, taking upon Himself.

21
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,250
That, we cannot do, we human beings, cannot
do it.

22
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:26,260
It’s only He being the Divine, He being
the Om, He being the Logos, He being the Brahma

23
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,750
could do it.

24
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,900
But now you all have ascended.

25
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,200
I can see on your faces: Christ writ large
on your faces.

26
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,720
It’s beautifully shining in your eyes and
twinkling.

27
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:51,650
He’s there within us, in our hearts, in
our eyes, and He has resurrected Himself and

28
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,030
He has resurrected you, too.

29
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,190
But now it is for you to resurrect other people.

30
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:04,090
You can resurrect other people, this is the
power you have got through Him, maybe, or

31
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,120
through your Kundalini.

32
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,031
But you have this power to resurrect other
people, but first and foremost thing [is]

33
00:05:11,031 --> 00:05:18,250
you have to be strong like Christ: how He
obeyed His Mother and how He obeyed all the

34
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,250
demands of His life.

35
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:28,080
How He was committed and how He dedicated
Himself to this single task.

36
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,300
He didn’t bother as to develop His monetary
side or to become some sort of a big officer

37
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:41,710
or to become another great rider, or a swimmer,
or climb on the Alps, some sort of a thing

38
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,900
like that.

39
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:50,030
(laughter) He didn’t try all these tricks,
and didn’t try to hanker after all these

40
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:56,480
things that sometimes make us quite mad.

41
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:10,260
What He did was to establish His identity
as the Brahma itself, as the Divine vibrations

42
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,050
itself, which He established.

43
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:22,500
And what you have to do is to establish yourself
as the resurrected people, as the realised-souls,

44
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,580
as the Sahaj Yogis.

45
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,699
And this is going to be very easy.

46
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:36,289
Now everything is made easy for you: your
realisation, then your powers, everything

47
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:40,050
has beautifully settled within you.

48
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,560
It has worked out so beautifully, slowly and
steadily.

49
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:59,389
I don’t think I have ever tried to force
you to do something or have compelled you

50
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:00,389
to do something.

51
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:06,050
But through your own ascent you can see what’s
wrong with you or with the people about whom

52
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,490
we are talking.

53
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:17,390
And then you can also know through all these
powers whatever is to be known.

54
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,600
All that is unknown can be your own, everything.

55
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,350
But the attention should be towards your ascent,
towards the state.

56
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:31,510
Now ascent is not some sort of a physical
process.

57
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,910
It is not that you ascend some staircases.

58
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,470
It is a state.

59
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,980
It’s a state of your personality.

60
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,169
And there where I always say…

61
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:43,830
Excuse me, I think I’ll [remove my sweater].

62
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,860
The sun is showing its results.

63
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,530
See how the sun listens to me!

64
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,340
Can you help me, a little bit, to take out
things, thanks.

65
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,800
It’s very hot for me, I don’t know what
about you people.

66
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:13,449
He’s just telling me off (the Sun).

67
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:22,789
I forgot to tell you about the Sun so he’s
just troubling me, so I better tell! (laughter

68
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:28,390
and clapping).

69
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:48,170
They have been telling for the last one year,
you see, we’ve been thinking of coming here

70
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,680
for this puja.

71
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,710
And I was very anxious that we should have
the Easter Puja here, but the dates were not

72
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,390
very suitable, because those days the moon
would be waning.

73
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,130
So I thought, “How will I do it without
the moon?

74
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,970
We have to have the moon there.

75
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,470
It’s important."

76
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,690
So I thought, “We’ll have it sometime
later."

77
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,570
And suddenly it happened that I have to come
here: luckily I was here.

78
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,710
And then on the television for the last one
week, they have been telling it’s going

79
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:29,030
to rain heavily, it’s going to be very clouded
(laughter) and the temperature is going to

80
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:37,340
be very bad and it’s going to be very, very
heavy rains.

81
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:43,730
(laughter and clapping).

82
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:56,210
And again and again, every night, every time
they announced about the weather it was looking

83
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,010
even worse, every time.

84
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:06,260
So I thought, “Now what to do?”

85
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:13,660
(laughter) If you ask the clouds to move out
you have to have a tremendous breeze and that

86
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,780
may spoil your tent.

87
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:27,160
So somehow or other I just told the clouds
that, “You’d better move on to Newfoundland,

88
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,570
slowly, steadily, not with great speed."

89
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:35,090
And they did it.

90
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,060
And then the Sun which was very bright came
out.

91
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,500
Early in the morning I saw Him, red like my
sari.

92
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,800
So beautiful it was.

93
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,430
And you were all asleep but I was awake, very
early (laughter).

94
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:54,410
And I was watching the way it came up: just
like my bindi it came up.

95
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:01,500
I saw it, and I said, “Look at the sun!

96
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,170
How obedient, how dedicated, how beautiful!”

97
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:11,210
Whatever it is: today is Mother’s Puja,
you have to have proper light, you have to

98
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,040
have proper temperature.

99
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,700
So look at the sky!

100
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,760
Look at everything!

101
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,100
And then gradually it became pink like your
faces.

102
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,380
It’s beautiful!

103
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,810
It became pink, beautifully pink, and then
now it’s shining.

104
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:33,070
I’m sorry I should have given full tribute
to the Sun, the way He has acted.

105
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:43,630
So that’s why He is troubling me a little
bit, you see, to remind me!

106
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:52,510
So, as you know the Sun is the Agnya chakra.

107
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:57,740
Christ resides in the Sun.

108
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:05,480
And in the body, in the being, He is the Spirit.

109
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,020
When He’s the Spirit, He’s the moon.

110
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,530
And when He acts on the Agnya He’s the Sun.

111
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:24,680
Now we have seen in His life that He was absolutely
spotlessly immaculate.

112
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,370
He had no defects in Him.

113
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,360
He was a perfect personality.

114
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,310
“Then why did He want to resurrect?” one
can ask.

115
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,890
What is in His time, is the resurrection.

116
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:51,600
His resurrection is like making the way through
the Agnya chakra for all of you to pass through

117
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,370
it.

118
00:12:53,370 --> 00:13:01,960
He was like the gate, or we should say He
was the One who opened the gate for all of

119
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
you.

120
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:11,600
Because He was so perfect, He had no problems
as we have of our chakras, our Kundalini.

121
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,200
He had no problems.

122
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:26,460
But He was the complete compassion in the
nature of vibrations: the vibrations became

123
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,180
complete compassion.

124
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:37,960
So much so that even when He was resurrected
and even before that when He was crucified

125
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:47,290
He said, “Oh, God, the Father, please forgive
those people because they do not know what

126
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,320
they are doing."

127
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,890
Such forgiveness, such compassion!

128
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:59,040
And the Mother had to watch all that, keeping
quiet, because that was the game, that was

129
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,140
the thing one had to do.

130
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,100
He had to play His game and He played it so
well.

131
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:13,110
So now when we talk about Christ, we have
to remember one thing: that He has done all

132
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,360
this for us, now what are we going to do for
Him?

133
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,390
He is the pattern we have to follow.

134
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:25,160
Supposing if that is the pattern we have to
follow, then it’s not that we carry the

135
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,650
cross on our shoulder.

136
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:30,880
That’s not the pattern you have to follow.

137
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,190
Many people think [that] because He carried
the cross, we can carry the cross.

138
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,440
Anybody can carry the cross!

139
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:44,200
In India, if you give about five rupees to
a loader, he can carry a cross across!

140
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,280
What is so great about it?

141
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,200
What is so great in carrying a cross on your
shoulder?

142
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,000
It’s nothing great.

143
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,230
Any wrestler can do it, anybody can do it.

144
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,560
That’s not the point!

145
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,190
The point is we have to carry the work of
Christ, of resurrection.

146
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,440
That is what we have to realise.

147
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:14,550
We have to understand the importance of our
being, of our lives, like Christ understood

148
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,850
that He has come for this great job here.

149
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:24,120
And though He came as a human being, though
He came as an ordinary son of an ordinary

150
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
carpenter.

151
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:32,830
Though on this Earth He had a body and He
lived like other human beings, still He knew

152
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:38,060
what He had to do, He knew what He had to
achieve and He achieved it.

153
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:44,330
I think His was the most difficult task, which
He achieved and which He furnished it, so

154
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,640
well, that today we are having all the benefits
of that.

155
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,070
Now let us see if we have done something for
Sahaj Yoga or not.

156
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,220
We all should examine ourselves: what have
we done for Sahaj Yoga?

157
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,290
Not carrying the cross, I mean to say.

158
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:05,350
Some people think when they travel in India
and if they carry the luggage of people downward

159
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,790
they are carrying the cross of Christ.

160
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,060
That’s not the way!

161
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,750
It’s something very, very serious one has
to think about.

162
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:22,440
And that seriousness is: how far we have achieved
that state, for that what have we done?

163
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:29,820
And a simple thing I have been asking all
of you: you have to meditate every day!

164
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,410
All of you have to meditate everyday.

165
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,350
But somehow nobody has time to meditate.

166
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:45,900
We are having these watches just to know that
we have to meditate, not for anything else.

167
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,180
Our lives are for meditation.

168
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,220
You need not spend all your twenty-four hours,
but you have to meditate!

169
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,100
Everyday you must meditate.

170
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,010
If you meditate your children will meditate.

171
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:05,520
And meditation is such a simple thing for
you, made so easy that all the elements you

172
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,799
can see work it out.

173
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:14,539
All your chakras are made of different elements
and when you clear out with the different

174
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:19,260
styles — I mean, you know all the methods
and the techniques of Sahaj Yoga — with

175
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:27,670
that when you clear out the chakras, when
you clear them out you are absolutely free,

176
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:32,100
absolutely at that stage where you have to
be.

177
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:38,020
But if you do not do this much even — is
to meditate — it’s going to be very, very

178
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:44,650
difficult for me and for you to achieve, for
which you have come on this Earth.

179
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:51,350
It’s a tremendous task that I have taken
over, I know that, but I know how to do it,

180
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,490
and you also know how to do it.

181
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:58,100
But the trouble is you get entangled into
your different conditionings.

182
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:05,320
Now, by now you must have realised, all these
so-called religions in anybody’s name: whether

183
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,680
it is in the name of Islam, in the name of
Christianity, in the name of Hinduism, in

184
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,330
the name of Sikhism — all this is falsehood.

185
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,950
It has no truth in it.

186
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,910
They have all tried to use it for their own
purposes.

187
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:31,870
There’s only one truth and that is: all
these great prophets and all these great incarnations

188
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:38,430
came on this Earth for your ascent and not
for establishing those religions who are just

189
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,920
interested in money.

190
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:47,100
In these religions also you will find there
are people who are either left-sided or right-sided.

191
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,280
There are some religions which preach you
should be very, very strict: you should not

192
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,180
do this, you should not do that, you should
not drink, you should not smoke.

193
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,560
There are some who say you should not marry,
you should not look at women, you should not

194
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,070
look at men — all kinds of restrictions.

195
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,940
Even in Hinduism you will be surprised, there
are so many restrictions.

196
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:20,370
If you see the amount of superstitions that
exist and that are created by brahmins in

197
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,690
India you will be shocked.

198
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,550
For everything there’s a superstition: if
you walk with the left hand ahead, that means

199
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:31,450
this, if you walk with the right hand, then
that means this; if you sit like this, that

200
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,450
means that.

201
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,450
Everything!

202
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:38,540
They have made a human being into a machine
and there’s no spontaneity about it.

203
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,770
All kinds of absurdities there are in Islam,
too.

204
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:47,990
But when we find them in a free place like
England, where there’s complete left-sidedness,

205
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,420
where you can do what you like but still you
are a Christian: if you drink, it’s all

206
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:58,300
right; if you have ten wives, it’s all right;
if you have fifteen keeps, it’s all right.

207
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:04,430
Anything you do is all right as long as you
go to church and pay money!

208
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:09,720
So there’s nothing [forbidden], especially
for the Protestants – that’s the religion

209
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,000
I was born in, where everything is allowed.

210
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,650
Now when we come to this kind of a thing,
what is the Christian religion is, then, comes

211
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:23,030
to, that, if you ask them the road, they’ll
tell you which way to go — that’s Christianity.

212
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,640
It’s coming to that end.

213
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:32,890
Now, all these religions either are indulging
into the Right Side or onto the Left Side.

214
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,490
Some people like the Left Side and some people
like the Right Side.

215
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:41,160
I will tell you the story of a priest, I went
to see him in Russia.

216
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,890
I think I have told it to some people before.

217
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:49,620
I went to Russia and the Russian people asked
me, “What would you like to see?”

218
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,530
So I told them I would like to go and see
some churches.

219
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,170
So they said, “All right, very good, we’ll
take you to a church."

220
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:02,610
So they took me to church and it was that
Greek Orthodox Church, and a Black Order,

221
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,680
which is supposed to be the highest.

222
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,980
I don’t know how they call it.

223
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:12,530
So we went inside and the priest said, “All
right, today I’m sorry, we cannot offer

224
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,050
you meat because our fasting is there.

225
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,930
But we’ll have lunch."

226
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,900
So we had a very sumptuous lunch and all that.

227
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,790
But the priest was only busy drinking, because
it was a fasting, so drinking is allowed,

228
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,790
according to them!

229
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,610
So he was drinking and drinking and drinking.

230
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,700
He drank so much that he forgot we were there!

231
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,870
We were supposed to be VIPs: just lost himself
into drinking!

232
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,250
So we thought better now have an honourable
retreat.

233
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:44,570
So we got up and walked out of that place
and this fellow didn’t even come to wish

234
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,570
us.

235
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,880
And these officers, the Russian officers,
didn’t drink, and didn’t do anything,

236
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,560
and they were laughing and laughing.

237
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,110
He said, “See now, this is Christianity!

238
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,360
That’s why we didn’t want to take to Christianity."

239
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,480
So I said, “But see, that’s not Christ."

240
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,030
They said, “That’s true, but what these
people are saying, is it Christianity?”

241
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,530
I said, “It’s not."

242
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:14,400
Now this gentleman, was supposed to be the
highest person in spirituality living in Russia!

243
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,070
So they have told me a story about the tzars.

244
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,970
You see, tzars wanted to have some religion
because they thought, “Everybody’s having

245
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,710
a religion, we have no religion.

246
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,800
Must have some religion."

247
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:33,580
So they sent for some people and the people
who came forward were Catholics to begin with.

248
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:38,630
So the Catholics said, “All right, you can
drink in Catholic religion."

249
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,870
I don’t know how they got this idea, but
it’s all right.

250
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:48,020
“Catholic religion you can drink but you
cannot have more than one wife."

251
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,120
The tzar said, “No, that’s not possible!

252
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,170
We have to have many tsarinas, you see, for
different purposes.

253
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,080
So we can’t have that religion!”

254
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,740
So they cancelled it.

255
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,170
So then the Islam: you see that time I think
they were no hindus available, thank God!

256
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:10,300
They had the Islam, Islam people went, and
the Islamic people said, “No, all right,

257
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:16,440
you can have five wives, it’s all right,
but you cannot drink."

258
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,930
They said, “That’s impossible!

259
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,200
How can we follow Islam?

260
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,570
That’s not possible!”

261
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,960
So, cancel it!

262
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,790
So these orthodox people — orthodox, you
see, the word orthodox remember that — they

263
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,790
came.

264
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,440
They said, “No, we are just in the centre,
you see.

265
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:40,120
We don’t mind if you drink, we don’t mind
if you have many wives, we don’t mind.

266
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,130
Only thing is, you have to pay us well!”

267
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,240
Tzars said, “All right, that’s good, let’s
have this religion!”

268
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,960
And that’s how they had this religion there.

269
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,580
So this is the situation of the religion today.

270
00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:03,360
All these religions have become sort of deformed
statues, good for nothing.

271
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:10,820
So now the inner religion within us is the
Sahaja dharma, which has to be fully followed.

272
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:16,460
Now, I told, in India, that now you are all
become Sahajas.

273
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:23,990
The story is like this, that there was a villager
who became a Christian.

274
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,770
So he came down to Allahabad to become Christian.

275
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:33,000
So he told them that, “You have to give
me a big name because now I am Saheb, I have

276
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,200
become an English man.

277
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,280
So you better give me a big name."

278
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,360
They said, “What name you want?”

279
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,650
He said “Give me the name of Alexander the
Great!”

280
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,380
So they called him Alexander.

281
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,740
But his name was Blondie, you see.

282
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:49,780
His real Indian name was Bhoora, so they called
him Alexander Bhoora.

283
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,780
So Mr.

284
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:56,190
Alexander Bhoora came to Allahabad and went
to the River Ganges for having his bath.

285
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,020
So the priest said, the pastor, he said, “You
can’t do that!”

286
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,150
He said, “Why?

287
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,030
Why can’t I do that?”

288
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:06,340
He said, “No, you can’t go and have bath
in the River Ganges because the Christianity

289
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,340
will drop out, you see!”

290
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,420
If he goes and has a bath in the River Ganges.

291
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,680
He said, “This you can’t do!”

292
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:18,840
So Alexander Bhoora said, “If I have become
saheb, I have become Englishman, that doesn’t

293
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,800
mean I have given up my religion!”

294
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
You see!

295
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:30,520
This is exactly what is happening to us when
we try to follow any religion whatsoever.

296
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,690
Now we are all identified with our so-called
religions in which we were born.

297
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:40,180
For example, if I told Indians, “Now, you
don’t go to temples!

298
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:45,960
You are not to go to any temple, even if it
is a swayambhu temple, unless and until you

299
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,560
have told me, don’t go to a swayambhu temple
at any cost."

300
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:58,070
There are many churches also where there are
very good statues, we can say, or have got

301
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,440
something which are really swayambhus, but
they are very few.

302
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,430
So you tell me and then go.

303
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:10,170
But they wouldn’t listen to me, they won’t
listen, and when they go there they catch

304
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,390
on their Agnyas.

305
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:17,950
Once I went to see one temple which was of
course a swayambhu temple, no doubt, so some

306
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,350
Sahaj Yogis decided to go there.

307
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,580
But I didn’t ask them, they didn’t tell
me.

308
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,480
When they came back, as soon as they saw me,
they all fainted.

309
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
I said, “What happened?

310
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,510
Where did you go?”

311
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,570
“Oh, we went to this temple."

312
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,570
I said, “Why?

313
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,690
You never told me.

314
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,994
And what do you have here [on your forehead]?”

315
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:37,830
You see, the Brahmin put the teeka (bindi)
and it’s finished!

316
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,750
Then it took them one month to clear out!

317
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:46,490
Now they don’t go, they’ve had enough
of it.

318
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:53,370
Same with the Christians: now the other day
I heard about the Paris episode where people

319
00:26:53,370 --> 00:27:00,370
wanted to have weddings in the church, in
Paris.

320
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,059
So they must have special dresses!

321
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:07,140
So somebody came here to buy some special
dresses from…what shop is that?

322
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,340
I forgot the name, some big name.

323
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:16,940
So the special dresses must be worn because
they have to go to the church!

324
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:22,650
And when they came out of the church with
those dresses, they had become bhoots.

325
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:26,560
I was surprised, what has happened to these
twenty-five of them?

326
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,180
What has happened is that in the church there
are many dead bodies buried, and they are

327
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,460
all caught up.

328
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:40,250
So when you go also to see the beautiful architecture,
go with a detached mind.

329
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,390
Don’t think that you belong to that church.

330
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,510
You don’t belong to any church.

331
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,610
You don’t belong to any temple.

332
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:52,370
Don’t belong to any one of these forms,
then only you will ascend.

333
00:27:52,370 --> 00:28:01,390
And I have to tell you today that Christ did
not belong to any religion.

334
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,610
He didn’t follow any religion.

335
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,840
He followed His own spiritual religion.

336
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,870
When He went to one church where there were
people who were discussing, I mean they were

337
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,490
Jews, He went there and He was talking to
them.

338
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:22,390
The other day I saw a beautiful painting they
had given on the newspaper, a very beautiful

339
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:28,150
famous painting where Christ is talking to
the doctors and He is holding His, rubbing

340
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:38,450
His Left Swadhishthana, very nicely, and all
the doctors, one of them is listening to Him,

341
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:43,190
one of them is looking at Him, sneering at
Him, another one is little bit paying attention

342
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,190
to Him.

343
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,530
He’s just rubbing His Left Swadhishthan.

344
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,380
It’s clearly [shown].

345
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,100
You can see it so clearly!

346
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,612
And so now, with these new achievements, you
must rise above all these things and you must

347
00:28:56,612 --> 00:29:02,190
understand that we have to be very independently
looking at ourselves.

348
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,920
We are no more belonging to any religion.

349
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:12,150
We belong to the religion of God which is
Sahaj.

350
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:19,100
And Sahaj is the religion, it will spread
only when you really become nothing but Sahaj.

351
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,490
But that’s something I don’t understand
— it doesn’t work out.

352
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:30,540
I met somebody from, I forget that, there
was, say, called ‘Hamaty’ or something

353
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:36,350
who was supposed to be an incarnation or something.

354
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:41,660
His disciples absolutely, I should say that
they behave in such a manner that you can’t

355
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,540
believe it: how ardently they believe in this
man.

356
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:52,340
Whatever he says, whatever he does, how they
believe in him.

357
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,850
It’s very surprising.

358
00:29:53,850 --> 00:30:01,580
You meet anyone who is following any guru,
anyone, you’ll be surprised the way they

359
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,270
are fanatic about this fellow and they will
not hear anything against.

360
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:12,690
Leave alone that, but if he says, “You stand
on your head for the whole night,” they

361
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,721
will do it!

362
00:30:13,721 --> 00:30:18,860
I don’t know what happens: when it comes
to falsehood, we try to follow it, and when

363
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:26,910
we know the truth, this is the truth, then
we take advantage and we try to compromise.

364
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:34,460
We think the truth will not do anything about
it.

365
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,730
Not that truth will punish you, it will not,
because you are realised-souls.

366
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,890
It will not.

367
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,650
It will not punish you up to a point.

368
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:51,790
But remember that Ekadasha is absolutely working
at the same time.

369
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:58,730
If we do anything wrong, like these people
went to the church, they were all caught up.

370
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,300
Now they may say that, “Mother, why should
we be caught up?

371
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,570
We are Sahaj Yogis."

372
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:10,150
Because you are vulnerable, you are vulnerable.

373
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,160
Yet you have not reached that stage.

374
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,960
If you reach that stage, then when you go
there, all the church people will come out

375
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,730
of the church and run away.

376
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,150
They’ll start shaking before you.

377
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,750
They will not know what has happened.

378
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:31,870
I have seen when I enter into any church all
the candles start going chuk, chuk, chuk,

379
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,520
chuk, chuk, chuk, and people start wondering
what has happened.

380
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,710
Even when they are having a dinner or something
and there is a candlelight dinner I am surprised

381
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,940
the way every candle starts flickering and
people start looking.

382
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:51,970
Because the bhoots are sitting before them,
you see, so the candles immediately show that

383
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,770
these are the bhoots sitting here.

384
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:59,370
With all this knowledge that you have, the
light you have within yourself, by which you

385
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:03,990
are enlightened, still if you are going to
these left and right-sided things, it’s

386
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,799
very, very dangerous.

387
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:13,520
We see that also, today, I must tell you about
the part that is politics.

388
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,860
In politics also these people have developed
two types of theories: one is left-sided,

389
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,309
one right-sided.

390
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:25,270
The left-sided theories are democratic, where
you can indulge into anything you like.

391
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,870
It’s the individual that is important.

392
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:32,910
The individual indulges into everything and
you should not stop him from doing whatever

393
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,910
he likes, he’s an individual: so he has
a right to cut his nose, he has a right to

394
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:40,820
cut his eyes, to do what he likes.

395
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:48,360
An individual is allowed to do what he likes
to do, and then what happens [is] that we

396
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,320
find this democracy becomes a demonocracy:
everybody is a demon.

397
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:02,990
Everybody is busy cutting throats, cutting
all the basis and the roots of life because

398
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:08,800
everybody is Brahma, becomes a great personality,
because the individual is so great and the

399
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,600
collective is lost, completely lost.

400
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:21,280
But on the other side, where it is more discipline,
more aggressiveness, more controls and everything

401
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,410
[with] the Right Side, which we can call as
communism, where people are controlled all

402
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,730
the time.

403
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,730
Now why?

404
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:32,710
Because for the collective the individual
must sacrifice.

405
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:38,070
In that case, the individuals become weak
and if the individuals are weak, then the

406
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,490
collective cannot be strong: it cannot be
strong.

407
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,360
The individuals have to be strong.

408
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:50,100
For example, you will see that the people
who come from communist countries, they drink

409
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,340
more than people who can drink here.

410
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:58,799
Or those who come, say from Islamic countries,
where they don’t touch anything, can drink

411
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,070
more than even sardarjees.

412
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:07,200
So you can imagine what is the situation of
human beings is that, out of fear if you try

413
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,520
to control him, he goes to the Right Side.

414
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:19,409
But he is in no way perfected, he’s not
transformed, he doesn’t accept the situation,

415
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:25,830
he doesn’t become that, he doesn’t have
that power to control himself.

416
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:30,690
He doesn’t get over his sinning aptitudes.

417
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,030
He’s still there.

418
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,980
As soon as he gets a chance he falls into
it.

419
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,560
So that fails.

420
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,310
So the individuals are weak in that case.

421
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:47,320
And where there is complete abandonment, do
what you like, live the way you like, indulgences,

422
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,869
all kinds of things, so you find [decadence].

423
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:55,540
I mean, everyday you see and you say, “Oh
God, this is a decadent society, this is happening!”

424
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:02,450
Decadence is because an individual [to] whom
you have given all these powers, has no power

425
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,540
to bear them.

426
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,100
An individual cannot bear money.

427
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,310
He cannot bear power of any kind.

428
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,230
He cannot bear love.

429
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,550
He cannot bear kindness.

430
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:22,960
He cannot understand peace because he’s
still an individual.

431
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:30,220
But when an individual becomes the collective
— this is the ascent through the central

432
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:40,370
path — when he becomes the collective, in
his strength he strengthens the collective.

433
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:46,520
And also the collective looks after, protects,
and guides the individual.

434
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,430
This is what Sahaj Yoga is.

435
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:54,710
So the politics of Sahaj Yoga is that you
have to become the collective personality.

436
00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:05,250
And there where we feel that still we are
something great, we are different, we are

437
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:13,200
Indians or we are from England or from France,
still if you are identified then you are not

438
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,840
collective.

439
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:20,930
In collective sense we are all one, part and
parcel of one being.

440
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:26,520
Then you are really acting as collective being
and you are one with the Divine.

441
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,869
Where the Sun is looking after you, the Moon
is looking after you, the winds are looking

442
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:38,520
after you; all the Mother Earth and all these
elements are working.

443
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:47,250
Ether, everything is working for you and you
are so well-protected and blessed by the special

444
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:51,080
quality to enjoy the joy.

445
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:57,520
Then you really become sensitive to that joy,
when you are one with the whole.

446
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:04,340
Like if supposing this finger or this finger
is not one with the whole, is numbed out…as

447
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:09,350
it happens in leprosy, what happens that this
finger becomes numbed out.

448
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:18,390
Even if a rat eats it off we don’t know
because there is no connection, no nerves

449
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,460
acting, it’s insensitive.

450
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:28,000
In the same way if you are not collective
and not bothered about collective you are

451
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,770
going to be dropped out.

452
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:40,080
You are not going to be there to enjoy the
beauties of your own glory and that of the

453
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,640
collective.

454
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,580
So one has to understand that we have to be
strong ourselves, we have to ascend and we

455
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,000
have to be collective.

456
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,240
It’s very easy to find out faults with others.

457
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,700
Very easy to find faults with the leaders.

458
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:01,000
Very easy also to find faults also with Sahaj
Yoga, sometimes with me.

459
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,730
Better find faults with yourself.

460
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,440
The rest I’ll look after.

461
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:13,340
First you just find faults with yourself and
try to understand others and love others and

462
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,220
enjoy the company of others.

463
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:24,550
This, once you decide that we have to enjoy,
I tell you, it’s so spontaneous.

464
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:31,520
Just this decision, this faith, within you
that, “I’m going to enjoy now my Spirit.

465
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,430
I’m going to enjoy the collective within
me,” that’s the Spirit.

466
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:41,420
Just this decision itself will give you the
power to enjoy.

467
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:49,380
But the decision should be firm, no hypocrisy,
no playing games, no ego, no conditioning,

468
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:55,970
nothing, just pure desire within us that we
have to be the Spirit.

469
00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:00,300
And the Spirit which is the collective being
within us.

470
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:09,910
I hope today on this day of resurrection,
we have to be thankful to Christ very much

471
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:23,050
for showing us the way and also we have to
be very much concerned and alerted about ourselves:

472
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,450
Where are we?

473
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,310
Where do we stand?

474
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,970
What are we up to?

475
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,070
What are we doing?

476
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,080
What is our responsibility?

477
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,990
What is expected of us?

478
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,830
Why all these blessings are given to us?

479
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:41,240
There’s no sacrifice in Sahaj Yoga, no sacrifice.

480
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:49,630
Nobody wants you anything to commit or to
do or membership or anything like that.

481
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,350
I think it’s my commitment.

482
00:39:51,350 --> 00:40:00,850
As I said, that God has the commitment but
you also have one commitment that your desire

483
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,850
should be pure.

484
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:06,450
That’s the only thing, that, “Let my desire
be pure!

485
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,990
No impurities of any kind, should work it
out."

486
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,740
As Christ had His desire, so pure, and that’s
what He achieved.

487
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,820
I am sure you can all achieve a lot in your
life.

488
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,869
Today is my sixty-fifth birthday.

489
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:27,590
Now imagine, I’m sixty-five years of age
and at this age most of the ladies, you see,

490
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:33,480
just, I don’t know what they do.

491
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
(laughter)

492
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:46,030
So now you must come up and work out everything
as far as possible, thinking that we all have

493
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,030
to stand up.

494
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,810
Now the children are coming up.

495
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,870
They are also going to stand up.

496
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,740
You are all looking younger to me and younger
to me.

497
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,750
Every day I see you, you look younger.

498
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:59,700
Sometimes I don’t even recognise you, the
way you look younger and I think, is he the

499
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:07,840
son or is he the father?

500
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:16,420
The situation is such that you are all blessed:
you’ve got jobs, you’ve got everything.

501
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,830
And everybody tells me, “Mother, this is
what has happened, that has happened!” everything.

502
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,230
Now, so what?

503
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:25,080
These are temptations, be careful.

504
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,849
This is not what you wanted.

505
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:35,460
What you wanted is the state of that complete
faith within yourself where you don’t have

506
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:41,670
to ask, nothing — everything will work out.

507
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,670
It works!

508
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,790
That’s [what] the point is.

509
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:54,230
So, I hope next time when we meet I’ll see
even younger people than what I see today

510
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:57,360
and I’ll be able to recognise you.

511
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,800
Christ died at a very, very young age, very
young age.

512
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,340
He was very young, I must say.

513
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:08,660
But how much He has done for humanity.

514
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,530
Nobody could have achieved that much in that
small age as He has done it.

515
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,670
It’s remarkable!

516
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,380
It’s really remarkable!

517
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:20,590
That’s what I expect you to follow, His
footsteps in doing remarkable things.

518
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:25,710
And let me see all of you, every one of you
have to do something great.

519
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,500
And today is the day of certain promises.

520
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,870
May God bless you for that.

521
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:33,130
And I thank you very much for this birthday
of mine.
