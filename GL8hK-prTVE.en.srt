1
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:39,361
Today is the great day,

2
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:44,892
when a great son of the Goddess was born,

3
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:48,894
at least it is celebrated today.

4
00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:53,787
And you are all assembled here

5
00:01:53,988 --> 00:02:01,822
to celebrate the birthday of Christ.

6
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:11,568
You already know how He came on this earth,

7
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:15,973
and what was His great work.

8
00:02:16,174 --> 00:02:20,966
But we must see to the subtle side
of Christ.

9
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:24,552
What was His power?

10
00:02:25,871 --> 00:02:30,743
Christ’s power was, of course, Omkara.

11
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:35,674
His power was Pranava.

12
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:41,074
But the essence of Christ

13
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:51,154
was tapasya, tapasvita.

14
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,110
He is the incarnation of tapasya,

15
00:02:59,892 --> 00:03:10,266
and in that incarnation is a sinless
personality.

16
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,913
He's sinless.

17
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:26,530
Of course incarnations never commit sins.

18
00:03:27,372 --> 00:03:34,750
But apparently things that look like sins

19
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,745
are also not in His life story.

20
00:03:38,946 --> 00:03:44,687
Like one can say that Shri Rama gave up
His wife, so it is a sinful thing.

21
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:47,673
Of course those who understand
the subtleties of Shri Rama's life

22
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:50,297
will know that it's stupid to say such
a thing.

23
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:54,952
Or Shri Krishna's life, they might say
He married so many women.

24
00:03:55,153 --> 00:04:01,734
But in Christ's life you do not find
anything

25
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:04,993
that could be pointed out as a mistake,

26
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:09,665
even a slightest mistake.

27
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:16,440
It's a very straightforward life,
absolutely pure life

28
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:26,937
and doing no commitments of ambiguous
nature.

29
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:34,515
But it's very surprising that Christianity

30
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:39,484
is just the opposite of what Christ
wanted it to be.

31
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:42,456
They painted Him so differently,

32
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,594
brought Him out so differently
and made a mess of His life.

33
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:51,568
Terrible mess I must say,

34
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:59,358
because He was the person who tried to keep

35
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:05,180
to the maryadas of the dharma
to the maximum.

36
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:14,274
And while the Christians stretched their
imagination to such an extent

37
00:05:14,504 --> 00:05:21,862
that their sinful life is shocking,

38
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:28,104
the kind of sins they commit is extremely
shocking.

39
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:33,625
For example, He said in a very subtle way,

40
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:38,418
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

41
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:43,236
Even in Sahaja Yoga I find people still
have this problem.

42
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:46,994
What a sinful thing to do to Christ.

43
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:55,596
For Christians to have such eyes which
are adulterous,

44
00:05:55,797 --> 00:06:02,385
and they are the people who have
the maximum number of this sin.

45
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:07,601
Not only that, but they generate it, they
give it to others.

46
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:12,949
Those who go to them, they develop it.

47
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:19,915
Those who meet them, they take it up
as something very great and elite.

48
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:24,180
It's such an infectious horrible stuff,

49
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:32,023
and even after coming to Sahaja Yoga
if you do not understand,

50
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:37,562
I cannot say what one can achieve in life.

51
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:42,315
Because He's the gate. You may cross
over all your chakras,

52
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:46,936
but if you are closed at that chakra
you cannot get out.

53
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:52,695
The kind of sinful life people are leading
in the western country

54
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:59,624
has to be absolutely condemned and has
to be thrown out of it,

55
00:06:59,825 --> 00:07:03,477
and nobody should explain it.

56
00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:08,116
Nobody should say that it is something,
is just a sin,

57
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:14,646
and all right, Mother will forgive, all
this kind of a nonsense.

58
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:21,415
Is the greatest wrong you are doing
to yourself and to Christ.

59
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:28,464
The abandonment of your character,

60
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:35,397
which was just the opposite of the golden
character of Christ.

61
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:43,589
He burnt Himself like chandan, sandalwood.

62
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:51,234
Like gold He came out of that fire of hell

63
00:07:51,435 --> 00:07:56,023
to burn away all that is sinful.

64
00:07:56,345 --> 00:08:01,086
So the first attention of anybody who
wants to cross the Agnya

65
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:07,364
has to be a sinless life,

66
00:08:07,565 --> 00:08:11,409
and that is what one has to realize

67
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:17,729
that how, in the West, they have become
all anti-Christ.

68
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:25,725
On this day of His birth, one has to say

69
00:08:25,926 --> 00:08:34,125
 that a great life, a great personality,

70
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:39,602
was not only wasted, but perverted,
misused.

71
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,559
Just can't believe, how can you use
the life of Christ

72
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,604
for doing all kinds of nonsensical things?

73
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:02,276
We have one instance where Christ
converted water into wine.

74
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:09,687
I can do it also - very easy. The wine
is not the alcohol.

75
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:17,028
Alcohol is the rotten wine. You have
to rot it for days together

76
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:20,942
and the more rotten it is, the more
old it is,

77
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:25,100
then it is regarded as something
very expensive.

78
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:29,156
The whole idea is so ridiculous,
I tell you,

79
00:09:29,357 --> 00:09:36,043
so repulsive, absolutely below

80
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:40,010
the dignity of human level to bring down
Christ

81
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:45,924
into all these social lives that you are
leading there.

82
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:52,307
For you it is important now, all the Sahaja
Yogis from the West,

83
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:58,717
to stand up and make your life pure,

84
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:04,252
make yourself pure, and hate all

85
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:08,299
that is created in the name
of Christianity.

86
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,197
Actually, thank God, they have found out
now

87
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:16,701
the book written by Thomas who has
described

88
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:19,819
the Gnostic way of life, where "gna"
means "to know".

89
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,571
In Sanskrit language, "gn" means "to know",
"gnya".

90
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:28,265
So he has described very nicely
the gnostic light.

91
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:35,702
This Gnostic Bible, or whatever you may
call it,

92
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:43,145
says about a personal experience
of achieving

93
00:10:44,123 --> 00:10:47,364
God realization, Self-realization.

94
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:50,932
It talks about Sahaj Yog out and out.

95
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:56,962
Thomas on his way to India, went to Egypt

96
00:10:57,163 --> 00:11:05,024
and there he has put this in a big vessel
of some metal.

97
00:11:06,122 --> 00:11:09,450
Thank God it was done in Egypt,

98
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:12,730
otherwise in any other place

99
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:17,981
they would have used it for some other
purpose,

100
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:22,285
and already it would have been a perverted
thing.

101
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:27,484
It's important, and very important for all
of us

102
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:33,052
to understand that the first and foremost
thing for us

103
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:36,166
is to purify our attention.

104
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:38,824
And for that Tukarama has said,

105
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:46,751
"Thank God, if I become blind is better."

106
00:11:55,223 --> 00:11:58,114
He was born in a very humble place

107
00:11:58,315 --> 00:12:02,049
because He was a tapasvi.

108
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,297
For a tapasvi it doesn't matter where
you are,

109
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:13,637
whether you are in a humble place or
you are in an elaborate place.

110
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:19,505
It doesn't matter where you are born
in a very humble way.

111
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:30,425
And this humility of His is never, never
expressed in the western lives.

112
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:43,374
On the contrary, I find they despise people
who are humble,

113
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:46,961
the humble abodes are despised.

114
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:56,104
Now it is for you people to bring back
the glory of Christ,

115
00:12:56,305 --> 00:13:01,576
to bring back the dharma of Christ,

116
00:13:01,777 --> 00:13:06,472
to reflect the great image of Christ.

117
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:11,310
When people say that you had no ideals,
I'm amazed.

118
00:13:11,511 --> 00:13:19,795
Who could be a better ideal than Jesus
Christ?

119
00:13:19,996 --> 00:13:22,955
Can't think of anybody better,

120
00:13:23,156 --> 00:13:30,742
but nobody tries to follow Him, only try
to use Him for wrong purposes.

121
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:35,789
Christmas means they are all must be drunk
already everywhere,

122
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:43,161
already drunk, and maybe they might have
had all kinds of programs

123
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:48,992
to show that they are absolutely insulting
Christ.

124
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:51,292
So today we have to pray for them,

125
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:55,039
that may God give them some sense,

126
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:57,396
not to do these things in the name
of Christ.

127
00:13:57,597 --> 00:13:59,968
They can do in the name of Satan
is all right,

128
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:06,143
but in the name of Christ to do all these
things is extremely wrong.

129
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:13,010
So coming to His Mother,

130
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:18,143
She was the power behind it.

131
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:22,534
And in India still all those people who
believe in Christ

132
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:27,398
do respect Her as something like a Goddess.

133
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:31,560
But other Indians, who are not Christians,

134
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:39,291
really think Her to be Goddess, and they
visit Her temples all over.

135
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,175
She was Mahalakshmi. And She was
Mahalakshmi,

136
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:49,816
which shows that people who follow
the Mahalakshmi principle

137
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:56,345
are beyond the material understanding
of life,

138
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:58,710
beyond the Lakshmi principle.

139
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:01,949
On the contrary, what we find,

140
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:09,224
they are extremely conscious about
the material wealth.

141
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:12,309
You should see how it shows so clearly.

142
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:16,954
Anything that they will buy, they would
like to buy something that can sell.

143
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:20,094
It must have a guarantee.

144
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:24,657
Even if they want to have anything

145
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:31,059
like a small little spoon, they would like
to see a brand behind it.

146
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:35,643
All the time they are thinking what can
they sell

147
00:15:35,844 --> 00:15:40,393
and what can they buy to sell it.

148
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:45,649
The attention doesn't go beyond that.
Moreover,

149
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:55,395
they are very much impressed by people who
wear something rather expensive or unique.

150
00:15:55,596 --> 00:16:00,378
One day I was wearing a ring, I think,
it's an old ring of mine.

151
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:02,497
For me it was nothing, I mean I just
thought

152
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:06,249
it's an old ring and was matching with
the sari, so I wore it.

153
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,733
Everybody started saying Me, "Madam,
Madam, Madam."

154
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,637
I said, "What has happened?"

155
00:16:10,838 --> 00:16:14,419
Started looking, I'm wearing a simple sari,
what is it?

156
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,362
Then one lady asked Me, "Is that
a real ring?"

157
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:22,729
I said, "Yes, yes, yes, so?"
"Oh Madam, Madam, Madam!"

158
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,128
I was amazed. Otherwise, I had no value,

159
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:29,572
except for that ring, for which I had
no value at all.

160
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:33,498
I just wore it by chance. It's an old ring
from My family.

161
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:37,040
All right, it might be real. So what?

162
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:41,990
Immediately you become "madam" if you
wear a ring.

163
00:16:42,872 --> 00:16:47,194
It's very surprising. But in this country

164
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:52,469
if you are going in a big car, people
don't like you much.

165
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,680
If you are going in a big car, and you
want to buy some vegetables,

166
00:16:55,881 --> 00:17:00,365
they will say, "Oh, how much black-market
money have you got?"

167
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:05,173
Not much respect for people who have money.

168
00:17:05,382 --> 00:17:07,911
Of course, you are expected to dress up

169
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:11,823
according to your status in life. But
that's all.

170
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:14,135
Those who wear do not have
the consciousness,

171
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:18,654
and those who see them do not have
the consciousness.

172
00:17:20,278 --> 00:17:24,628
It is something very surprising, that where
you are supposed

173
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,994
to be worshipping the Mahalakshmi
principle,

174
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:33,869
people just get absolutely blown off

175
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,294
if they see something extraordinary.

176
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:45,285
I have seen people, I mean very, supposed
to be,

177
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:49,563
you can say high class ambassadors
and all that.

178
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:53,015
If they come to My house. they would
like to turn

179
00:17:53,216 --> 00:18:00,417
the plate to see from where it comes,

180
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:05,213
or they would like to, even to see
the spoon from where it comes.

181
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:07,406
It's very surprising.

182
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:12,808
Actually, we do not know in this country
what comes from where, what is the mark.

183
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,558
We don't have any marks, nothing
of the kind.

184
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,586
And we are existing alright, nothing
wrong with us.

185
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:27,044
This kind of mental attitude towards life

186
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:32,389
and the mental projections towards life

187
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,578
makes you absolutely gross,

188
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:41,060
while Christ was the subtle, complete
subtle.

189
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:46,129
It was nothing but subtlety itself
personified.

190
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:53,311
He was so subtle, He was such a sukshma
that He walked on the water.

191
00:18:54,273 --> 00:19:01,112
He was nothing but pranava, just
vibrations.

192
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:04,064
He walked on the water.

193
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:06,374
There was no jada tattwa in Him.

194
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:09,844
There was no gross principle in Him,

195
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:19,667
and while the people who follow Him are
following nothing but the jada tattwa.

196
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,800
I have to now request you all today

197
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:28,131
to understand that when we are celebrating
the birthday of Christ,

198
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:34,370
we have to imbibe His qualities, His
subtleties, His greatness.

199
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:39,138
Also, I would request Indians, because they
are also becoming westernized now,

200
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:42,689
thinking that western people are
the wisest.

201
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,376
They have to understand

202
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:51,181
also that we should try to be subtler and
subtler, and not gross,

203
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:56,253
and this is what is important in Sahaja
Yoga culture.

204
00:19:56,454 --> 00:20:02,012
In Sahaja Yoga culture, our attention is
on the subtle things.

205
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:05,921
On the beautiful varieties of subtleties.

206
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:12,236
To see all the sweetness and the goodness,

207
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:25,651
all the artistic, aesthetic projections
of human mind.

208
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:29,610
Not the gross, not the grotesque.

209
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:33,328
It's going to be a new culture for us.

210
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:35,548
We have started the dharma, all right.

211
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:38,154
But every dharma has to have a culture

212
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:47,505
and we are the culture of sukshma,
of the subtler life.

213
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:51,278
That doesn't mean we should be untidy

214
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:55,276
or any way funny type, funny looking
people.

215
00:20:55,477 --> 00:21:02,203
Subtler people are the most beautiful,
are the most congenial,

216
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:12,809
are the most idealistic, and are the most
honorable like Christ.

217
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:16,368
So for us the ideal is Christ.

218
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:20,348
Of course, I don't expect you to crucify
yourself.

219
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:25,781
But always willing to sacrifice,

220
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:32,937
coping with all the discomforts and
problems

221
00:21:33,138 --> 00:21:39,470
and not talking about yourself, not
worrying about yourself,

222
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:44,897
not discussing other and judging others,

223
00:21:45,098 --> 00:21:50,250
but giving assurances to people,

224
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:58,210
that now we are at this level, we'll be
at a higher level,

225
00:21:58,411 --> 00:22:02,553
and all the world has to come up
to that level.

226
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:07,065
Very positive talking, very positive
thinking

227
00:22:07,266 --> 00:22:12,285
and very positive doing is the way you
can really follow Christ.

228
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:22,111
Whatever He had to do, He did it with
such grace and beauty.

229
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:28,174
That is what it is. So we have to be born
like Christ today.

230
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:35,226
You are all born like Christ because you
are born without the Father,

231
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:40,545
by the Holy Ghost, just like Christ was
born.

232
00:22:40,746 --> 00:22:44,872
But look at Him and look at yourself,

233
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:49,096
born the same way as He was born.

234
00:22:49,297 --> 00:22:56,176
So you must respect yourself as He
respected Himself.

235
00:22:56,377 --> 00:23:02,444
And the way He worked out His resurrection.

236
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:06,114
In the same way, you all have to work out
your resurrection,

237
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:08,673
and that is very important.

238
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,150
Today you have to just ask just one thing
from Me, that

239
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:15,394
"Oh, Mother, today we ask you to give us

240
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:22,933
that power of penance, of tapasya
of Christ."

241
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:28,112
I wish this would be granted today and
you will become tapasvis.
