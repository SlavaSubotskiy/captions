1
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:31,769
  Today is the great day, when a great
son of the Goddess was born, at least it is

2
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:53,819
celebrated today. And you all are assembled
here to celebrate the birthday of Christ.

3
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,880
You already know how He came on this earth,
and what was His great work. But we must see

4
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:23,390
to the subtle side of Christ. What was His
power? Christ's power was, of course, omkara.

5
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:37,860
His power was pranava.  But the essence
of Christ was tapasya, tapaswita [CORRECT

6
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:58,670
SPELLING?]. He is the incarnation of tapasya,
and in that incarnation is a sinless personality.

7
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:22,250
He's sinless. Of course incarnations never
commit sins. But apparently things that look

8
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:38,880
like sins are also not in His life story.
Like one can say that Shri Rama gave up His

9
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,380
wife, so it is a sinful thing. Of course those
who understand the subtleties of Shri Rama's

10
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,150
life will know that it's stupid to say such
a thing. Or Shri Krishna's life, they might

11
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:59,150
say He married so many women. But in Christ's
life you do not find anything that could be

12
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,400
pointed out as a mistake, even a slightest
mistake. It's a very straightforward life,

13
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:19,710
absolutely pure life and doing no commitments
of ambiguous nature.  But it's very surprising

14
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,680
that Christianity is just the opposite of
what Christ wanted it to be. They painted

15
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:48,139
Him so differently, brought Him out so differently
and made a mess of His life. Terrible mess

16
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:56,729
I must say, because He was the person who
tried to keep to the maryadas of the dharma

17
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:05,889
to the maximum. And while the Christians stretched
their imagination to such an extent that their

18
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:24,349
sinful life is shocking, the kind of sins
they commit is extremely shocking. For example,

19
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,080
He said in a very subtle way, "Thou shalt
not have adulterous eyes." Even in Sahaja

20
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:46,650
Yoga I find people still have this problem.
What a sinful thing to do to Christ. For Christians

21
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:55,039
to have such eyes which are adulterous, and
they are the people who have the maximum number

22
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:08,199
of this. Not only that, but they generate
it, they give it to others. Those who [WENT…del]

23
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:17,169
go to them, they develop it. Those who meet
them, they take it up as something very great

24
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:25,559
and elite. It's such an infectious horrible
stuff, and even after coming to Sahaja Yoga

25
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:35,319
if you do not understand, I cannot say what
one can achieve in life. Because he's the

26
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:45,139
gate. You may cross over all the chakras,
but if you are closed at that chakra you cannot

27
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:52,139
get out.  The kind of sinful life people
are leading in the western country has to

28
00:06:53,409 --> 00:07:00,409
be absolutely condemned and has to be thrown
out, and nobody should explain it. Nobody

29
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:11,159
should say that it is something, is just a
sin, and all right, Mother will forgive, all

30
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:19,490
this kind of a nonsense. Is the greatest wrong
you are doing to yourself and to Christ. The

31
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:32,969
abandonment of your character, which was just
the opposite of the golden character of Christ.

32
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:42,639
He burnt Himself like chandan, sandalwood.
Like gold He came out of that fire of hell

33
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:56,469
to burn away all that is sinful.  So the
first attention of anybody who wants to cross

34
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:07,449
the Agnya has to be a sinless life, and that
is what one has to realize that how, in the

35
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:19,789
West, they have become all anti-Christ. On
this day of His birth, one has to say that

36
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:34,770
a great life, a great personality, was not
only wasted, but perverted, misused. Just

37
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:47,550
can't believe, how can you use the life of
Christ for doing all kinds of nonsensical

38
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
things?  We have one instance where Christ
converted water into wine. I can do it also

39
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:12,190
- very easy. Wine is not the alcohol. Alcohol
is the rotten wine. You have to rot it for

40
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,930
days together and the more rotten it is, the
more old it is, then it is regarded as something

41
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:29,930
very expensive. The whole idea is so ridiculous,
I tell you, so repulsive, absolutely below

42
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:43,260
the dignity of human level to bring down Christ
into all these social lives that you are leading

43
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:50,260
there. For you it is important now, all the
Sahaja Yogis from the West, to stand up and

44
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:02,080
make your life pure. Make yourself pure, and
hate all that is created in the name of Christianity.  Actually,

45
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,760
thank God they have found out now the book
written by Thomas who has described the Gnostic

46
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,980
way of life, where “gne” means “to know”.
In Sanskrit language, “gne” means “to

47
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:30,980
know”, “gne”. So he has described very
nicely the gnostic life. This Gnostic Bible,

48
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:38,500
or whatever we may call it, says about a personal
experience of achieving God realization, self

49
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:51,810
realization. It talks about Sahaja Yoga out
and out. Thomas on his way to India, went

50
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:02,880
to Egypt and there he has put this in a big
vessel of some metal. Thank God it was done

51
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:15,380
in Egypt, otherwise in any other place they
would have used it for some other purpose.

52
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,020
And already it would have been a perverted
thing.

53
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:28,020
 It's important, very important for all
of us to understand that the first and foremost

54
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:38,940
thing for us is to purify our attention. And
for that Tukarama has said, “Thank God,

55
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:48,090
if I become blind is better.” He was born
in a very humble place because He was a tapaswi[CORRECT

56
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:08,140
SPELLING?. For a tapaswi it doesn't matter
where you are, whether you are in a humble

57
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,880
place or you are in an elaborate place. Doesn't
matter where you are born in a very humble

58
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:25,290
way. And this humility of His is never, never
expressed in the western lives. On the contrary,

59
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:42,700
I find they despise people who are humble,
the humble abodes are despised.  Now,

60
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:54,480
it is for you people to bring back the glory
of Christ, to bring back the dharma of Christ,

61
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:08,200
to reflect the great image of Christ. When
people say that you have no ideals, I'm amazed.

62
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:18,670
Who could be a better ideal than Jesus Christ?
Can't think of anybody better, but nobody

63
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,760
tries to follow Him, only try to use Him for
wrong purposes. Christmas means they’re

64
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:39,150
all must be drunk already everywhere, all
very drunk, and maybe they might have had

65
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:46,890
all kinds of programs to show that they are
absolutely insulting Christ. So today we have

66
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:56,990
to pray for them, that may God give them some
sense, not to do these things in the name

67
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,890
of Christ. They can do in the name of Satan
is all right, but in the name of Christ to

68
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:09,890
do all these things is extremely wrong.  So
coming to His Mother, She was the power behind

69
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Him. And in India still all those people who
believe in Christ do respect Her as something

70
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:32,120
like a Goddess. But other Indians, who are
not Christians, really think Her to be Goddess,

71
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:41,310
and they visit Her temples all over. She was
Mahalakshmi. And She was Mahalakshmi, which

72
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:52,800
shows that people who follow the Mahalakshmi
principle are beyond the material understanding

73
00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:01,690
of life, beyond the Lakshmi principle. On
the contrary, what we find, they are extremely

74
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:11,040
conscious about the material wealth.   See
how it shows so clearly. Anything that they

75
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:20,070
will buy, they would like to buy something
that can sell. It must have a guarantee. Even

76
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:27,070
if they want to have anything like a small
little spoon, they would like to see a brand

77
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:36,670
behind it. All the time they are thinking
what can they sell and what can they buy to

78
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:43,670
sell. The attention doesn't go beyond it.
Moreover, they are very much impressed by

79
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:54,090
people who wear something rather expensive
or unique. One day I was wearing a ring. It’s

80
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,550
an old ring of mine. For me it was nothing,
I mean I just thought it's an old ring and

81
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:08,690
was matching with the sari, so I wore it.
Everybody started saying me, "Madam, Madam,

82
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:14,410
Madam." I said, "What has happened?" Started
looking, I’m wearing a simple sari, what

83
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:21,410
is it? Then one lady asked me, "Is that a
real ring?" I said, "Yes, yes, yes, so?" "Oh

84
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:27,840
Madam, Madam, Madam!" I was amazed. Otherwise,
I had no value. Except for that ring, for

85
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:34,650
which I had no value at all. I just wore it
by chance. It's an old ring from my family.

86
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:41,650
All right, it might be real. So what? Immediately
you become "madam" if you wear a ring.  It's

87
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:50,040
very surprising. But in this country if you
are going in a big car, people don't like

88
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,970
it much. If you are going in a big car, and
you want to buy some vegetables, they will

89
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:02,970
say, "Oh, how much black market money have
you got?" Not much respect for people who

90
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,429
have money. Of course you are expected to
dress up according to your status in life.

91
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:15,400
But that's all. Those who wear do not have
the consciousness, and those who see them

92
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:22,400
do not have the consciousness.  It is
something very surprising, that where they

93
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:30,809
are supposed to be worshipping the Mahalakshmi
principle, people just get absolutely blown

94
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:37,809
off if they see something extraordinary. I
am seeing people, I mean very, supposed to

95
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:48,910
be, you can say high class ambassadors and
all that. If they come to my house they would

96
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:58,290
like to turn the plate to see from where it
comes, or they would like to even to see the

97
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:09,070
spoon from where it comes. It's very surprising.
Actually, we do not know in this country what

98
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:15,910
comes from where, what is the mark. We don't
have any marks, nothing of the kind. And we

99
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:22,910
are existing alright, nothing wrong with us.
This kind of mental attitude towards life

100
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:33,190
and the mental projections towards life makes
you absolutely gross, while Christ was the

101
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,790
subtle, complete subtle. [IT…could Sri Mataji
have meant ‘He’] was nothing but subtlety

102
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:50,790
itself personified. He was so subtle, He was
such a sukshma that He walked on the water.

103
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:59,610
He was nothing but pranava, just vibrations.
He walked on the water.  There was no

104
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:11,920
jada tattwa in Him. There was no gross principle
in Him, and while the people who follow Him

105
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:22,480
are following nothing but the jada tattwa.
I have to now request you all to today to

106
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:31,030
understand that when we are celebrating the
birthday of Christ we have to imbibe his qualities,

107
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:36,990
his subtleties, his greatness.  Also,
I would request Indians, because they are

108
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:43,690
also becoming westernized now, thinking that
western people are the wisest. They have to

109
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:50,690
understand also that we should try to be subtler
and subtler, and not gross, and this is what

110
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,960
is important in Sahaja Yoga culture. In Sahaja
Yoga culture, our attention is on the subtle

111
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:08,380
things. On the beautiful varieties of subtleties.
To see all the sweetness and the goodness,

112
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:23,050
all the artistic, aesthetic projections of
human mind. Not the gross, not the grotesque.

113
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:36,290
It's going to be a new culture for us. We
have started the dharma all right. But every

114
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:43,290
dharma has to have a culture and we are the
culture of sukshma, of the subtler life. That

115
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:55,090
doesn't mean we should be untidy or any way
funny type, very funny looking people. Subtler

116
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,200
people are the most beautiful, are the most
congenial, are the most idealistic, and are

117
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:09,650
the most honorable like Christ.  So for
us the ideal is Christ. Of course, I don't

118
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:24,809
expect you to crucify yourself. But always
willing to sacrifice, coping with all the

119
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:35,030
discomforts and problems and not talking about
yourself, not worrying about yourself, not

120
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:46,950
discussing other and judging others, but giving
assurances to people that now we are at this

121
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:03,100
level, we'll be at a higher level, and all
the world has to come up to that level. Very

122
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:10,100
positive talking, very positive thinking and
very positive doing is the way you can really

123
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,880
follow Christ. Whatever He had to do, He did
it with such grace and beauty. That is what

124
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:30,160
it is. So we have to be born like Christ today.
We are all born like Christ because we are

125
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:38,920
born without a father, by the Holy Ghost,
just like Christ was born. But look at Him

126
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:48,860
and look at yourself, born the same way as
He was born. So you must respect yourself

127
00:22:53,270 --> 00:23:00,270
as He respected Himself and the way He worked
out His resurrection. In the same way, you

128
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,580
all have to work out your resurrection, and
that is very important.  Today you have

129
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:15,580
to just ask just one thing from Me, that “Oh,
Mother, today we ask you to give us that power

130
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:20,470
of penance, of tapasya of Christ.” I wish
this would be granted today and you will become

131
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,140
tapasvis[CORRECT SPELLING?. May God bless
you.    [Note: After the puja, Shri

132
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,210
Mataji commented that this was one of the
two most powerful pujas we have ever had.

133
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,360
She also said that it's easy to be Christ,
but it's most difficult to become the Mahalakshmi,

134
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,680
and at this puja, that was accomplished.]
