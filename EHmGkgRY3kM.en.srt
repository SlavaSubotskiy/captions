Sahasrara Puja Cabella Ligure, Italy
6th May 6, 2001

2
00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:06,542
Today I bow to all the Sahaja yogis

3
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:09,125
who have found the truth.

4
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:19,667
There has been from ages

5
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:23,250
the seeking for the truth.

6
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:28,250
And when people discovered

7
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:34,709
that there’s no other way but to surrender

8
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:40,709
to the Divine that you can find the truth,

9
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:46,417
they did not know how to do it,  how to work it out.

10
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:53,250
There have been seekers all over the world.

11
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:59,375
I went to Turkey and I was amazed  there have been lots of Sufis,

12
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:03,125
but their disciples were not realized souls,

13
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:07,709
because the Sufis also did not know how they got their realization.

14
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,375
Such darkness existed around

15
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,125
people who were seeking.

16
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,041
All over the world I find,

17
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:23,458
when I was a little girl,

18
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:29,709
that they are completely ignorant about

19
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:33,166
how to find the truth.

20
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:40,083
So many were lost in all kinds of so-called

21
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:43,709
religions and rituals.

22
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:47,291
All kinds of rituals they used to do;

23
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:52,000
morning till evening, some sort of a ritual they would do.

24
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:56,667
Whether they were Hindus, Christians, Muslims,

25
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,333
they all believed that by doing all  these rituals

26
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:05,000
you’ll achieve something, that you will know the truth,

27
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,125
that you will get your Self-realization.

28
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:15,083
All such seekers went to wrong people

29
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:19,375
and to wrong directions,

30
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,458
because they were really seeking from their heart.

31
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:27,250
So they were very misleading,

32
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:32,458
misleading and they were misled

33
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:40,625
into such horrible black areas

34
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,083
that they did not know what they were seeking,

35
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,417
what they are supposed to seek, what they have to have.

36
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,625
It has been prophesized

37
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,291
that when Kali Yuga will come,

38
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:02,709
people will find themselves.

39
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:09,083
There’s a story about Nala and Kali,

40
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:18,583
who had taken away the wife,

41
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,291
Damayanti, of Nala.

42
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:29,542
So once Nala caught hold of him,

43
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,583
and he said that “Now I’m going to kill you,

44
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:37,041
because you are a very mischievous man

45
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,500
and you have done such a harm to me.”

46
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:45,250
So the Kali said,

47
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,291
“You can kill me,

48
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:50,250
but before that you should know what is my importance,

49
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:55,417
what is my mahatva. And the my importance is

50
00:03:55,542 --> 00:04:00,041
that when my time will come”

51
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,208
–when Kali Yuga will come –

52
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:07,625
“then all those people who are seeking the truth

53
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:15,667
in the jungles, in the hills and dales,

54
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:23,166
in the Himalayas will become ordinary householders,

55
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:29,125
they’ll be householders. They won’t be sanyasis going about,

56
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:34,500
they’ll be householders, and they will find the truth.”

57
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,041
This has been prophesized long time back,

58
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:42,250
and also there’s a book about it, a book;

59
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:47,417
as you must have read in the book which says

60
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:52,375
that the time has come for people  to know themselves.

61
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,417
Every religion has said one thing,

62
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,166
that you must know yourself.

63
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:05,709
Islam says the same, Buddha says the same,

64
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:11,250
Christians say the same, Hindus say the same.

65
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:20,458
So till then they go on doing all kinds of acrobats,

66
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,041
but they realize that “we haven’t found the truth.”

67
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:34,375
So it came to My lot;

68
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,333
from My childhood I knew I had to do it.

69
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:42,333
But when I saw the human beings,

70
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,500
how much in darkness they were about themselves,

71
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:53,542
how aggressive and how sinful they were,

72
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:59,417
all their style was so cruel

73
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,625
that it was unbelievable.

74
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,417
That was the time also I saw Hitler coming up,

75
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:15,125
and our country also was in complete bondage.

76
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:23,500
So the first thing was to make our country free,

77
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:31,291
was very important. And that’s why I took a very, very active role

78
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:37,291
in the movement that was for the freedom of our country;

79
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:41,208
same with My father and mother.

80
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:50,417
But when we got the freedom somehow, after some time we got lost.

81
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:56,375
People started taking to all kinds of modern things

82
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:01,208
which were wrong, which were so-called entertaining.

83
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:08,458
With all that, I found all over the world

84
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:13,583
there was a big seeking force,

85
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,125
and some false people took full advantage of it.

86
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:23,291
They went out, made lots and lots of money,

87
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,667
and with their falsehood they cursed them,

88
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,709
I don’t know what they did to them.

89
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,709
So many seekers were lost like that.

90
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:37,250
Despite that I went to America, and I was shocked

91
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:40,041
how the things were going on there.

92
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:44,625
But I couldn’t help it because they were so

93
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:49,417
mentally  ill-equipped,

94
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:54,125
they could not understand what they have to have,

95
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,500
and you can't pay for the truth.

96
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:06,125
Then it happened that I had started it after

97
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:12,083
the Sahasrara was broken. And you know the story

98
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,667
how I broke the Sahasrara,

99
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:23,166
and how from one person I started giving realization.

100
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,709
But from America I got very disappointed.

101
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,375
I was thinking, “How will it grow? How will it work out?”

102
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:38,583
We had about twenty-five people who were realized souls by then

103
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:46,250
in India,  but they realized what they have got by realization.

104
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:51,709
They realized that they have become very good people,

105
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,625
they have given up all bad habits;

106
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,291
and they were wanting to worship Me.

107
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,250
I said, “No, no, don’t worship Me

108
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:08,667
because people will not understand.”

109
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,458
But they one day forced Me.

110
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,083
So on our terrace of the house they came

111
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,250
and worshipped Me,  because

112
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,542
somebody had told them, “This is the Goddess.”

113
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:27,583
So what had happened was after the program

114
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:31,625
one maidservant came up who was possessed.

115
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:35,500
And she came and she started calling Me

116
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,542
by the name of “Goddess.”

117
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,000
So people said, “What are you saying?”

118
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:45,208
She was a woman, but talking like a man.

119
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,542
So she said, “I’m telling you the truth.

120
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,333
She is the Goddess who has come to save us.”

121
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:57,709
Her language was not that of a maidservant

122
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:04,083
but of a very well-educated brahmin,

123
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:08,500
who would say all Adi Shankaracharya’s stotras.

124
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:13,458
It was very surprising. So they asked her several questions

125
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,625
and then she just fainted.

126
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,500
So I told them, “Just don’t listen to her, it’s no use.”

127
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,417
But they would not agree,

128
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:23,667
and they said, “Mother, we have to worship You.”

129
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:27,542
So somehow I agreed to that,

130
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:33,375
and they got hold of seven brahmins to do that.

131
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:41,041
They were afraid because to do that puja it’s very dangerous

132
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:45,041
and it could harm you, if it is not the truth.

133
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,291
But on the contrary when they were doing  the puja

134
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,709
they got their realization.

135
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:53,417
And they just said, “Now, this is the truth.

136
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,000
” They felt the cool breeze in their hand,

137
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:01,125
all the symptoms told about a realized soul started.

138
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:08,041
But I didn’t want to say everything at that time,

139
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,208
because

140
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,583
there were many others who were saying, “I am this, I am that,”

141
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:19,333
so I didn’t want to sort of expose it altogether.

142
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,250
But gradually I found that

143
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:26,500
people got attracted and they used to come to My program,

144
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,500
and then the Sahaja Yoga started spreading

145
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:36,375
allover in a very interesting manner.

146
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,625
So this Sahasrara

147
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,333
Day, or we can call the day when the Sahasrara was opened out,

148
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,208
is a very important.

149
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:54,125
It’s very subtle. We just know about the kundalini,

150
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,375
that she’s coiled up in three-and-a-half

151
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:01,083
and she’s lying in the triangular bone

152
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:03,500
known as sacrum.

153
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:07,500
But we don’t know what she works, how she works,

154
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,625
or what happens to us.

155
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:15,500
She rises in six centers

156
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:21,375
and breaks the seventh center, I should say breaks the sixth center

157
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,542
because Ganesha’s center doesn’t play any role

158
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:33,208
so when she breaks the sixth center which is the Sahasrara,

159
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:39,667
then she connects you to the all-pervading Power of divine love.

160
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:50,083
But what is this divine love?

161
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,125
What does this do?

162
00:12:54,125 --> 00:13:01,208
It is the energy of the Mother,

163
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:06,208
we can say it is the energy of Adi Shakti

164
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:13,417
which is all over, works through vibrations.

165
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,625
But what are these vibrations?

166
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:22,500
It’s a very subtle energy that

167
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:26,041
starts flowing through your Sahasrara.

168
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,625
All the thousand petals of the Sahasrara

169
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,667
get slowly enlightened

170
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,125
and it starts flowing throughout your body,

171
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:43,667
throughout your hands, feet, throughout your body.

172
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:48,125
And the more you are,

173
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:53,125
I mean your attention is on the Sahasrara,

174
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,709
the more it works faster.

175
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,542
Now in the science I’ve read

176
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:04,333
that they have discovered an energy called, they call it …

177
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:12,291
I don’t know how it – ask the scientists that!

178
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:19,333
What energy?

179
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,500
quantum hah,  quantum energy.

180
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,041
Quantum, I don’t know why they call it quantum,

181
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,500
because “quantum” means four.

182
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:34,542
” So it might be meaning the energy of Ganesha maybe,

183
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:38,041
I don’t know. Because scientists are blind people,

184
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,041
I don’t know what they call what!

185
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,208
So they are saying there’s a quantum energy.

186
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:45,709
Now this quantum energy

187
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:51,041
according to them flows in a very subtle manner,

188
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:56,667
and it is normally not visible but it has light.

189
00:14:57,542 --> 00:15:02,709
You have seen that in so many of photographs of Mine

190
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,041
there’s light of all kind.

191
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,083
This energy moves in a light,

192
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:13,583
so this is the quantum energy, I think – again I am not very sure,

193
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,250
because scientists are, I’ve always found them

194
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,041
just a little bit vague.

195
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,166
But this quantum energy they’re talking about

196
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,208
is something like  the spiritual energy

197
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,417
or the energy of love,

198
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:31,291
which flows around. And this quantum energy,

199
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:37,667
they do not know what it does but they have seen it has got light.

200
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,000
They call it “quantum” because according to them

201
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,542
it flows in bundles,

202
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:47,125
and every bundle is a “quanta” according to them.

203
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:53,709
Now this energy when it flows, as you have seen yourself, it works.

204
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,083
It works in every direction, in every dimension.

205
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,709
For example it works physically.

206
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:04,542
Supposing you have some physical ailment,

207
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:08,333
you have seen many people get cured in My presence,

208
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,125
just in My presence – I need not do anything to them.

209
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,250
Or also as soon as I see somebody, I know what he’s suffering from.

210
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:22,709
That’s also, I must say, My connection with the Divine;

211
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,583
and that tells Me what’s wrong with what person

212
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:32,208
and what should be done, and it can be cured in no time.

213
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,083
Because that also comes to Me just like that. I mean,

214
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,417
I don’t ask any questions,  I don’t try to find out,

215
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,125
I do not analyze, but it just says, “Do like this”

216
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,709
or it also doesn’t say, it just does.

217
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,166
It just works automatically.

218
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:55,583
It is very difficult to explain how this energy works.

219
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,667
But all of you who have got realization

220
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,166
can also work out your own energies.

221
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:08,291
How? By releasing it, by feeling it,

222
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,709
by giving it to others, by experimenting.

223
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:21,667
Of course, Sahaja Yoga has spread because of you only.

224
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,417
You are the people who have brought people to Sahaja Yoga.

225
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:30,667
But that’s not the end of it. We have to save this world.

226
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:35,041
For that at least I feel forty percent

227
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,166
of people should get their realization.

228
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,208
Whatever may be their nationality,

229
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,542
whatever may be their education, anything,

230
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:52,417
they are to be given Self-realization. In our Indian

231
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:59,125
scriptures it’s clearly written, “Without Atmasakshatkar

232
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:03,291
your life is useless.” But what is Atmasakshatkar,

233
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:07,625
is the knowledge about yourself. How can you have that knowledge

234
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:13,000
unless and until you become one with this all-pervading Power?

235
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:18,542
So it was a very great thing, I felt, that this Sahasrara

236
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:23,125
I could open in 1970.

237
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:28,208
I realized I was overwhelmed

238
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,125
because I knew this is the only trouble,

239
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,333
it is the only obstacle human beings are having:

240
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:40,208
because their Sahasraras are not open, that’s why they are

241
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:45,500
going in the darkness, that’s why they are having wars,

242
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,500
that’s why they are having all kinds of problems.

243
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:52,375
But if their Sahasrara opens

244
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:55,417
and if they become one with the divine Power,

245
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,041
all their problems would be solved,

246
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,166
every type of problem will be solved

247
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,333
and they’ll be very happy people.

248
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:08,709
I realized it and I was very happy, I was over-joyous.

249
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:12,458
But nobody understood Me.

250
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:17,125
I don’t know, they thought I must be talking something nonsensical.

251
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,667
Nobody understood it what it is,

252
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:24,375
because even in the shastras it’s not written

253
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:29,375
about kundalini so clearly.

254
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:33,542
Only one great saint called Gyaneshwara

255
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:38,417
wrote it in his book in the sixth chapter, about the kundalini.

256
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:43,083
It’s not so clear, only he said that with the kundalini

257
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,625
you can get your awakening.

258
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,667
Also you sing that song always I’ve heard,

259
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:53,375
which says that “Oh Kundalini Mother, please be awakened!”

260
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:58,166
But nobody knows that what this kundalini is

261
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,709
and why are you singing that song.

262
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:05,083
It was all in our country people used to sing in the village

263
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:10,667
so clearly, but nobody understood the meaning of it.

264
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:15,417
Just they used to sing as a, some sort of a bhajan or could be

265
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,333
some sort of a music concert.

266
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:21,375
But nobody knew what it was talking about.

267
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,333
It was such a misunderstanding about everything.

268
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:29,583
And all these poets also who have written

269
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:35,417
clearly about awakening, about realization,

270
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,125
everything was just in the books.

271
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,000
They would read one line of the book, then stop there.

272
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,458
Another person would start the another line,

273
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:48,083
then he stops at another line, point;

274
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,166
like that they were just reading.

275
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:54,125
Same thing about all the scriptures.

276
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:58,375
There was big misunderstanding created

277
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:04,208
and was used for the purpose of their own self-interest.

278
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,375
That is how we couldn’t get people

279
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:11,208
who understood what was Self-realization.

280
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,041
It was just for some money

281
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:18,375
or for some certain type of a position to get,

282
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:25,375
people started big, big organizations,

283
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:30,625
very big religious organizations

284
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,542
I don’t know what to call them –

285
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,583
but none of them were realized souls.

286
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:40,709
For example, there was a great saint called Viditama

287
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:48,458
who went to China, and he started a religion called Zen.

288
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,375
Zen means dhyana.

289
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:56,500
And he wanted to put Zen

290
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:01,000
in such a manner  that people become thoughtless

291
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,333
He made a big tank

292
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:11,083
full of sand with patterns and put some stones,

293
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:17,208
and he had said that “You sit on the edge of this pond

294
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:22,333
and just see, but don’t think.”

295
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,709
People didn’t understand what it was.

296
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,458
Normally anybody would go there and say,

297
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:32,583
“Oh, this looks like some ships in the sea,” or all kinds of things.

298
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,583
But nobody tried for thoughtless awareness.

299
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:41,333
And I told some of them that this is for thoughtless awareness,

300
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,083
but they couldn’t understand.

301
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:49,583
Then we have also in Japan, Tao.

302
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:54,709
He talked about the all-pervading Power which was Tao,

303
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,709
and Lao-Tze was the one who did.

304
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:03,375
He had described saints: how the saints are,

305
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:06,709
how they behave, how they talk,

306
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:11,166
what is their mannerism, everything.

307
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,667
But how you become a saint, nobody said.

308
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:19,208
I think throughout there has been no description

309
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:25,041
how to make a person into a saintly personality.

310
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:49,333
So also in the twelfth century

311
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:55,417
Gyaneshwara was in the twelfth century

312
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:59,667
he talked about it and he said about it in his book, everything.

313
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:03,375
Because it was a kind of a

314
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:07,709
style that a guru should have only one disciple,

315
00:24:08,542 --> 00:24:12,583
who should give to one disciple realization, not to many.

316
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:17,166
I don’t know why, what made them such a law or a rule.

317
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:22,166
And then it started in the twelfth century, there were many saints

318
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:29,000
who sang the praise of realization.

319
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:33,500
And all of them thought that these rituals are no good,

320
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:36,458
so they discarded rituals and this.

321
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:40,583
But what was the thing that had to happen, nobody knew.

322
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:45,542
I have read all their lives,

323
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:50,083
I’ve read afterwards also many saints who were there,

324
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:56,166
but it seems nobody knew how to raise the kundalini.

325
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:59,250
This was the basic problem,

326
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:01,709
they didn’t know how to raise the kundalini;

327
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,458
while I think they didn’t have that power,

328
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:08,417
or maybe they had no knowledge.

329
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:11,125
They talked about kundalini, all right,

330
00:25:11,417 --> 00:25:14,709
but they did not know how to raise the kundalini.

331
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:21,000
This is a very special power of spirituality.

332
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:24,250
None of them have been able

333
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:27,542
to say or tell you how to raise the kundalini.

334
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:31,000
Now you all have got this power,

335
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,333
which is such a rare thing.

336
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:35,458
All of you have got it,

337
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:39,125
I don’t see anybody who doesn’t have that power

338
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:42,291
to raise the kundalini. You may not;

339
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:45,166
you may be contented with yourself,

340
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,333
but that’s not a very good thing.

341
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:52,166
If you have got your Sahasrara opened out

342
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:55,291
and if you know how to raise the kundalini,

343
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,500
you must go all out to give realization to people.

344
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:05,375
Nothing is going to benefit people more than Self-realization.

345
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:10,166
No use doing other charities, giving money, giving this

346
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:14,667
is of no use. Best thing is to go all out

347
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,667
to see people who want their realization,

348
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,250
and to give them realization.

349
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:22,291
I was very happy to see

350
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:26,709
that they have started working it out on the gypsies.

351
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:29,542
I’ve a special feeling for gypsies.

352
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:34,125
For no fault of theirs, they are leading a very miserable life.

353
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,709
And how the gypsies got the realization!

354
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:43,250
You can see that you can give it to anyone

355
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:48,417
who wants to have it. One thing is there you cannot force on anyone.

356
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:52,333
If they have a desire,

357
00:26:52,542 --> 00:26:55,125
they can get Self-realization.

358
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:59,375
So this day, I have to just say now so many years have passed,

359
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:03,166
I have worked quite hard, day and night,

360
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:06,542
and My only desire was

361
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:12,083
that you people should take  it seriously and work it out.

362
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,542
Don’t keep your realization to yourself.

363
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:18,250
As many as people you can give realization,

364
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:22,417
the greatest obligation will be on Me

365
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:27,125
and on God Almighty. Only thing is you should try

366
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,625
to give realizations to others.

367
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:32,375
You will never make a mistake,

368
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:35,667
you can never make a mistake because the kundalini knows.

369
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:39,291
She knows you, she knows you are realized soul.

370
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,000
She’llrespect you.

371
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:44,333
Even if you make mistakes she’ll correct it

372
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:47,625
and she’ll help you, in every way.

373
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,291
I’m just a, I should say a housewife

374
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:58,417
who had no support from anyone.

375
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,375
But I was sure that it’s My job to find out

376
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:06,166
how to break the Sahasrara.

377
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:10,083
Whatever way it is – outside doesn’t matter –

378
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:16,375
My job it was to find out the breaking of Sahasrara, which I did.

379
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:21,041
Now you also know that, so this is your job.

380
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:23,208
And the scientists now will be coming around

381
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:25,041
you to ask you questions,

382
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:28,417
because they don’t know what they are talking about is

383
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,709
what we are already doing.

384
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:36,291
So you are so powerful, all of you. But how many of you are really

385
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:38,709
doing this work, is the point.

386
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:42,542
Today is a very important day. I want to tell you

387
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:47,667
that you have to strengthen My hands.

388
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:52,041
They say the Goddess has one thousand hands,

389
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:56,458
but even the one thousand hands are now asking

390
00:28:56,583 --> 00:29:00,375
that you come along with your two hands and work it out.

391
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,166
It’s very important what you have to do.

392
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:09,625
All kinds of problems in this world, they come because of ignorance

393
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:13,500
take it politics, take it any, any problem.

394
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,291
And how it is solved is also,

395
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,667
is your power with the Divine.

396
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,041
I’ll give you one simple example.

397
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:28,375
That day the Turkish people came

398
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,208
and were begging of Me, “Mother,

399
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:33,208
You must come. You should not postpone,”

400
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:36,500
and this passport, My passport was a problem.  I said,

401
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,625
“The passport is not ready, how will I come?”

402
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:43,583
But then I thought, “Why not? We’ll have the passport also done.”

403
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,709
So passport was ready.

404
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:49,542
And they wanted Me to go to Turkey because they said,

405
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:51,583
“The financial condition has gone down very much,

406
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:54,625
the economy has gone down absolutely, we are ruined.”

407
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:59,041
I went there, I didn’t do anything about it;

408
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:03,333
within two days they announced

409
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,709
ten billion dollar help from the World Bank.

410
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:11,458
Now I didn’t talk to World Bank, I had nothing to do with them,

411
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,583
I don’t know.

412
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:17,458
Then I said, “No, maybe you see, they are helping because

413
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:19,417
you people are in such trouble.

414
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:21,333
” They said, “But so many countries are,

415
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:23,625
why have they helped us only?”

416
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:26,250
I said, “That’s the point!”

417
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:29,458
So now I was surprised, in Turkey

418
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:33,208
there are only ladies mostly who are leaders, mostly,

419
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,250
and they have done such a big job.

420
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:40,542
Now I want to see what you people are doing in your country.

421
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:45,208
You may say that “In my country the people are hopelessly bad.”

422
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:47,542
Maybe, I don’t say no.

423
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,667
But still there are places, there are pockets

424
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:55,500
where you can go and talk to them, tell them,

425
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:58,291
specially the media you must handle.

426
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:05,417
It is something you have to do, and find out why you can’t do it.

427
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,208
Like Me: I was not supported by anybody,

428
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:11,709
not helped by anybody,

429
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:15,583
and how I have managed to break the Sahasrara –

430
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,583
you can also break the Sahasraras of others.

431
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:22,709
It’s not difficult, because My vision is

432
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:25,583
that this world

433
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:29,709
at least should have forty percent people who are realized souls

434
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:34,625
and who are practicing Sahaja Yoga,

435
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:38,500
who are giving realization to people

436
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,125
and trying to change the people.

437
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:46,041
Anybody who can go and tell, anybody.

438
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:48,667
There’s no need to discriminate

439
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:51,166
or to find out, or sit down with their

440
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:54,417
I mean people take sometimes the

441
00:31:54,709 --> 00:32:00,208
copy of their education and this; that's not needed.

442
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,583
Whosoever it is.

443
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:07,500
I’m not saying give it to dogs or to animals,

444
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:12,709
but to human beings. They may be anything;

445
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:17,208
they may be English or they could be Germans,

446
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:24,041
they could be Italians anywhere.

447
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,583
I am told also some people

448
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:29,500
are doing lots of seminars and working very hard

449
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,125
on all levels, and it is working out.

450
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,333
Among Muslims also we have started working,

451
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:39,166
and even in India it has worked.

452
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:42,625
You don’t know, people have not lost all their heads,

453
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:44,625
so it can work out.

454
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:48,667
Don’t be very much disappointed and upset about it;

455
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:53,291
gradually it will improve. I think the greatest enemy

456
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:58,250
of our Self-realization is the drinking.

457
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:03,083
Drinking, if people take to drinking they become such slaves,

458
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:06,417
they don’t – their brains are not all right.

459
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:11,625
So I think the Sahasrara also must be spoilt with drinking.

460
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,667
So drinking I think is the worst enemy.

461
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:18,250
And if you could find anybody drinking,

462
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:21,375
if you could help that man to give up drinking itself,

463
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:25,667
it will work out.  Of course we have other enemies also,

464
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:30,542
like false gurus are there. Also we have other enemies

465
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:37,625
who are having some sort of religious manipulations,

466
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:40,041
but that’s not so important.

467
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:43,458
If you can get hold of people who are drinking,

468
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:49,125
I tell you it will change. And they will now understand

469
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,250
that what they have been doing so far, drinking,

470
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:55,166
running away – now they’ll come

471
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:58,041
to the fields and they’ll work out Sahaja Yoga.

472
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:03,333
So you are like very gentle soldiers of love,

473
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
and that’s what you have to spread

474
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,208
and talk to others, give them that joy that you have.

475
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:16,625
Not be satisfied if you have got it only, or few of you have it.

476
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:20,166
You have to spread it very fast, and you can do it.

477
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:24,417
Because it doesn’t require money, it doesn’t require any show;

478
00:34:24,709 --> 00:34:28,166
it is just inside, it works, it’s already there.

479
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,041
It’s present there, everybody has it. I knew all that,

480
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:35,458
of course I knew it; but now you also know it.

481
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:39,250
So you should work it out, and work it out in the manner

482
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:44,709
that I am sure one day this world will be a changed place.

483
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,417
Thank you very much.
