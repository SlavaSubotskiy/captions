1
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:40,270
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Ganesha
puja.

2
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:58,170
The first Deity that was created by the Adi
Shakti was Shri Ganesh because it was necessary

3
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:12,300
first to create the Deity of principles.

4
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:31,910
The deity of principle in the sense that whatever
is created, whatever is there as called ‘bhava’

5
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:38,760
– whatever has been so far created – up
to human level.

6
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:58,530
Everything had to be through the implanted
mechanism of energy otherwise nothing could

7
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:05,190
have been created.

8
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:15,640
If you go into the matter, say sulphur dioxide,
then sulphur and oxide — go on deep into

9
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:25,579
it till you reach the state when it is a molecule
— then you see these atoms of sulphur and

10
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:30,280
oxygen, they oscillate.

11
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,750
They oscillate with a frequency.

12
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:41,040
There are three types of frequencies they
use.

13
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:52,420
Now imagine in the molecule – think of it
– in the molecule of a substance there is

14
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,510
an energy which is acting.

15
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,810
Now one may say that, “Why should be in
matter there is energy?”

16
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:16,630
One can ask a question, why there should be
energy in matter.

17
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:27,669
If there was no energy in the matter, how
can you have all chemical compounds?

18
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,760
Who pushes them?

19
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:37,840
Say you have sodium chloride – sodium and
chloride are attached to each other.

20
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:46,180
But if the chloride has to go to some other
atom then who does that?

21
00:04:46,180 --> 00:05:03,180
There has to be some energy which is absolutely
inbuilt into matter.

22
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:17,740
Now, we may say that, “What about water?”

23
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,750
You know water has energy, that’s how we
have hydrostatics.

24
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:36,389
Even coal, even stones, all of them have got
energy within themselves.

25
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:43,660
And it is all controlled by the principle
of Shri Ganesh.

26
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:53,710
So, though He’s such a small, little, tiny,
little child, how great is His work and how

27
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,389
much He has to work out.

28
00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:04,590
Now from matter, you move, say, to living
plants, then to animals, then to human beings

29
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,910
and everywhere His energy works.

30
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:16,669
At the level of matter, they might call it
‘electromagnetic’ but potentially it is

31
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:22,680
the energy of Shri Ganesh, which is electromagnetic
at that point.

32
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,270
Then it starts evolving, growing.

33
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:40,080
That’s how we have different stratas of
energies that we see in different growth of

34
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,220
the evolution.

35
00:06:46,220 --> 00:07:05,740
In the human being it exists, as you know,
as auspiciousness, as purity, mainly the innocence.

36
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:13,639
So the power of innocence is such a guiding
factor.

37
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:21,770
There’s a difference between ignorance and
innocence.

38
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:37,819
If you are innocent then, to you, nothing
is important except for love.

39
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:48,240
For an innocent person – who is not conditioned,
who is not egoistical, who is not so-called

40
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:56,960
matured – it is the love that it understands.

41
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:14,870
It doesn’t care for any wealth, any power,
anything but the love that it can feel, the

42
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,389
pure love of a person.

43
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:33,409
Innocent person has no understanding of gaining
anything out of the love he receives or he

44
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:38,210
gives; no sense at all.

45
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:44,540
Innocence is the basis of all the dharmas.

46
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:58,230
If you have no innocence you cannot follow
dharma because if you are dharmic it is maybe

47
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:07,010
your mental attitude, maybe egoistical, maybe
because you are born in a religion or because

48
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,470
somebody has told you about it.

49
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,810
It’s going to be very superficial.

50
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:24,680
Unless and until it is embedded in the quality
of innocence dharma has no meaning.

51
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,790
In that state you are dharmic.

52
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:37,280
You are beyond any thinking about it, of any
deductions about it.

53
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
But you are dharmic.

54
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,680
You cannot be adharmic.

55
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,530
You cannot be.

56
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:52,069
As if the manifestation of innocence is morality.

57
00:09:52,069 --> 00:10:01,730
Once Shri Ganesha is awakened — I hope He
has been awakened in all of you — and if

58
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:11,870
you respect Him, just respect Him, then automatically
you develop a sense of morality.

59
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,510
I don’t have to tell you.

60
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,580
I don’t have to explain to you.

61
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:24,040
You just become moral.

62
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:31,030
People who have seen you are quite amazed
and said that, “How is it that their eyes

63
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:37,300
are fixed, so innocent, without any lust and
greed?”

64
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:49,400
It’s the light of Shri Ganesha from the
Back Agnya, Front Agnya; the Jesus Christ,

65
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:58,030
who is the manifestation of Shri Ganesha.

66
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:03,640
It is impossible for [the] Western mind to
understand that Jesus Christ was purity.

67
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,690
They can’t understand.

68
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,740
And they have criticised Him and said horrible
things against Him.

69
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,069
But somehow He’s forgiving them.

70
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:27,820
But one thing about Shri Ganesh is that He
worships His Mother.

71
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:44,320
Motherhood is very important: motherhood in
the women, motherhood in the father and also

72
00:11:44,320 --> 00:12:01,030
in the children has to be accepted as the
mainstay of family life and society.

73
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:16,700
The ordinary life of a human being, [of] very
simple, innocent, simple people, revolves

74
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,590
around the mother.

75
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,189
It revolves.

76
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:26,190
But the mothers have to be mothers.

77
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:42,390
As Shri Ganesha is so much surrendered to
His Mother and who is His Mother?

78
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,179
Is Adi Shakti.

79
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:46,809
He does not know anybody else.

80
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:52,459
He just knows His Mother.

81
00:12:52,459 --> 00:13:03,910
This is extremely important in Sahaj Yog.

82
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:20,770
As we say, there are immoral human beings
and they are doing immoral things because

83
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:31,560
they are committing sin against the Adi Shakti.

84
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:44,270
Committing sin against Ganesha they may be
forgiven but committing sin against the Adi

85
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:59,190
Shakti…It encompasses a very big area where
we start seeing how we are committing the

86
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:09,280
sin against the Adi Shakti which, ultimately,
Shri Ganesha punishes, ultimately.

87
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:23,250
Actually, the Adi Shakti doesn’t punish
anyone, the Deities only punish them.

88
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:38,670
First and foremost thing that is to be understood
[is] that innocence should be respected, looked

89
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:44,130
after, nourished and protected.

90
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:50,980
That’s why I am very particular about the
children.

91
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:57,290
Children should not be exposed to the public.

92
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:04,610
We should not try to make photographs out
of our children and expose them in the newspaper

93
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,760
or give them for advertisement or anything
there.

94
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:25,910
It’s a very wrong idea to expose your children
to gain some money out of them: in any way,

95
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,690
in the smallest way also.

96
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:34,959
Because we are selling the innocence, the
innocence which is invaluable, writ large

97
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,220
on the children.

98
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:49,680
Many children I know, who have been advertised
and all that, specially in India have died.

99
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:57,440
Also we have to look after our children with
great care.

100
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,160
But we go to two extremes, I have seen.

101
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,689
Some people are only worried about their own
children – if anything happens to them [they]

102
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:10,890
just get upset.

103
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,289
That means you are respecting your child because
he’s your child.

104
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:22,299
But if you are respecting him because he carries
innocence with him, then you have to respect

105
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:31,200
every child and understand every child: what
they talk, what they say, how they behave.

106
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,689
Luckily, you all have got children now who
are born-realised.

107
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:37,339
It’s such a great thing!

108
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:39,980
It’s such a blessing!

109
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,069
So on one side, we have to see how innocent
they are and how they talk.

110
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:48,290
I’ll give you an example.

111
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:57,630
Wolfgang was very serious and his wife told
me that we were taking him to the hospital,

112
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,730
so his daughter says, “Why are you taking
him to the hospital?

113
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,089
There are no Sahaja Yogis there!

114
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:08,249
How will they correct his chakras?”

115
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:09,919
Innocently said the correct thing.

116
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:10,919
And they couldn’t do.

117
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:12,530
Doctors didn’t do anything.

118
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,870
I had to cure him!

119
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,699
“Take him to Mother!

120
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:19,420
Why are you taking him to the hospital?”

121
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:27,329
They see the right point and say the right
thing because they are innocent and innocence

122
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,850
means they have pure attention.

123
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:39,200
Pure attention, for anything, you need: say
[for] music, for art.

124
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:47,330
For anything you have to have pure attention
and that comes through your innocence.

125
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:54,380
Say a person who is an artist and who is very
money-oriented, for example, a person who

126
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:00,620
is doing some paintings and all that: his
art cannot become eternal art.

127
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,620
Cannot.

128
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,390
That’s why we see in modern times [that],
whatever art is created, it just comes and

129
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,390
goes.

130
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,030
It has no eternal value.

131
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,630
Same with the modern music that they are having.

132
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,180
The same thing is happening.

133
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:24,059
It comes and goes and no one knows where it
has disappeared.

134
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:37,519
Behind it is money orientation and that money
orientation results into a kind of a creation

135
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:42,830
which is not perfect.

136
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:51,799
All creations which were dedicated to God
in the olden times are being today very much

137
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,580
respected and people pay a lot of money for
that.

138
00:18:54,580 --> 00:19:00,860
Maybe, at that time, the artist must have
suffered, but they understood, innocent artists

139
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:12,240
understood very much, that if we have to express,
we must truthfully do it.

140
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,710
Not to please the people, not to please anyone,
but to please God.

141
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:23,860
As you know that Michelangelo had a big fight
with this pope here because he couldn’t

142
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,909
tolerate nonsense that was coming from the
pope.

143
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:33,130
All the artists always have been fighting
— real artists.

144
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:37,730
So this innocence also gives you a power of
self-understanding.

145
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:44,250
You know where you stand.

146
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:53,909
A person who is innocent knows very well that
he is standing on the pedestal of virtues.

147
00:19:53,909 --> 00:20:01,530
He should not give in to all kinds of nonsensical
things which are very popular, may be fashionable,

148
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,530
may be accepted.

149
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,730
For what?

150
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:11,370
For what are we going to sacrifice our innocence?

151
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,980
What is our gain?

152
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:21,840
Maybe some people are too brilliant and they
may try to show off with their brilliance

153
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,509
for a short time but they don’t remain in
the eternal history.

154
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:38,250
They go as egoistical people or as very dishonest
people.

155
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,810
Nobody respects them.

156
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:55,860
So there is a big attack on the innocence
of people, a big attack.

157
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,330
First it comes on children.

158
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:03,730
As you see, this nonsense that is going on
which we hear about — I mean, I can’t

159
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,450
even understand why they do it.

160
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:13,370
They do it on children, these funny attacks
of abuses.

161
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:19,640
It’s just because they want to kill the
innocence.

162
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:26,580
Perhaps those who do it have no innocence
in them and they don’t want the children

163
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,140
to have any innocence left in them.

164
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,809
Otherwise, in India it’s something we can’t
understand.

165
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:36,110
Really, we can’t understand.

166
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:43,690
But it is becoming much more prevalent, much
more fashionable now because there is definitely

167
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:56,230
an attack on innocence; not only on children
but even on people who are innocent.

168
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:07,740
Because those who have deliberations in criminality,
in all kinds of sinful acts will never, never

169
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,049
try to protect innocence, never!

170
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:15,320
Because the juxtaposition is there.

171
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,830
They are doing something which they think
is the best.

172
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,070
I don’t know if they think that way.

173
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:27,919
But I don’t know what justifies their behaviour
like this – is to attack the innocence of

174
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,960
children.

175
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,600
In so many ways, you will find [that] this
innocence is being attacked.

176
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:45,179
If your children are doing well, if they are
studying well, somebody might try to catch

177
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,730
hold of them.

178
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:57,610
If some person they find is an innocent person,
they will try to put him into trouble.

179
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:10,149
The innocence itself is such a power that
it challenges the hatred, the abusive nature

180
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:11,740
of people.

181
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:24,190
First of all, we should see how our conditioning
takes over our innocence.

182
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,210
It makes you extremely ritualistic.

183
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:49,700
Even in Sahaja Yoga, I have seen – I have
heard also – that people are extremely ritualistic.

184
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:56,820
Now the ritualism is like this: that you have
to say something three times, you say it three

185
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:01,919
times, seven times like tied up people.

186
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,399
I have seen some some Sahaja Yogis like that.

187
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:13,429
And some Sahaj Yogis, I think they must be
bhootish, get frightened with me.

188
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:15,259
What is there to be frightened of me?

189
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:21,379
Because they are bhootish, they are getting
frightened.

190
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:23,389
Otherwise why should you?

191
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:31,860
I love you all and you won’t find a greater
mild guru than myself.

192
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,340
I don’t think so!

193
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,009
But they are afraid.

194
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,509
Even if you look at them they’ll not smile,
they’ll be afraid.

195
00:24:41,509 --> 00:24:42,690
What wrong have you done?

196
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,400
You have become Sahaja Yogis!

197
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,529
They are so ritualistic in everything!

198
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:56,340
So one should understand a difference between
a protocol and ritualism.

199
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:01,179
An innocent child knows the protocol.

200
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:09,740
I remember there was a child who came to see
me in Oxted and I said, “Let’s go upstairs!”

201
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,980
So it was a small, little staircase of wood.

202
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,110
He said, “What?

203
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:21,130
Is She going to go up without a red carpet?”

204
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:25,580
This came into his head!

205
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:33,869
So for children, innocent children, the worship,
everything is not ritualistic, it is heartfelt.

206
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:46,559
You feel it from the heart: how to do the
worship, how to show your love.

207
00:25:46,559 --> 00:26:00,620
It’s very sweet [the] way an innocent person
does it, while a person who is very ritualistic,

208
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:06,460
he may even beat another person because, “Why
did you do this?

209
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,730
You should not have put camphor in it?

210
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,019
Why did you put the camphor?

211
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:12,529
So, it’s very wrong."

212
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,409
There’s nothing wrong.

213
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:24,769
If you do it with your heart, with your open
heart, innocently – anything is all right.

214
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:32,759
It is the open heart which is necessary, not
the closed heart – “Why did you do it?

215
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,519
Why didn’t you do it.

216
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,460
Where did you sit?

217
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,460
What happened?”

218
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,460
Nothing!

219
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:45,320
Now you are in the kingdom of God and here
there are no such rules and regulations that

220
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,419
you should be ritualistic.

221
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:50,990
But everything has a double style.

222
00:26:50,990 --> 00:27:00,040
Now I say, you need not be ritualistic so:
once I went into an ashram.

223
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,330
I found everything was just like a pigsty.

224
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,980
I said, “What’s this?

225
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,020
Is this an ashram or what is it?”

226
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:17,259
So they said, “Mother, you told us that
you have to be innocent and you don’t have

227
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:20,080
to be ritualistic.

228
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,549
So we thought, ‘Throw all the things wherever
you feel like.

229
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,320
What is there to be ritualistic?’

230
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,650
” It’s a very common thing.

231
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:36,320
All the ashram leaders tell me that Sahaja
Yogis have no sense at all of looking after

232
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,360
the cleanliness of the ashram.

233
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,629
They are least bothered.

234
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:46,720
If it is their house, they look after, but
if it is an ashram they do not.

235
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,090
It’s very surprising!

236
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:55,019
And I have seen, or I have heard, that the
ashrams all of bhootish and false gurus are

237
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:56,769
absolutely spick-and-span!

238
00:27:56,769 --> 00:27:58,929
Really!

239
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:05,429
It’s very surprising.

240
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:15,610
And, even here in Cabella, people were telling
me that they are living like animals.

241
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:20,590
I said, “Animals are innocent, you know!”

242
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,120
You go into a jungle, now — I don’t know,
we are going to take you this time (on India

243
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:31,119
Tour to Kanha National Park) into a jungle
— you will have no smell, no horrid things

244
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,299
to see, nothing.

245
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:35,120
It’s very clean, spick-and-span, all the
time.

246
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:42,639
But [if] you put one human being, you will
immediately know there has been a human being.

247
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:46,279
They have their own systems of keeping things
clean.

248
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:53,610
Even the tiger, who is an innocent thing — up
to animal stage you are innocent — he has

249
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,870
his own styles.

250
00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:02,320
I don’t know if you know about a tiger or
not, but a tiger will kill an animal because

251
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,120
he has to eat, after all.

252
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,379
He supposed to only eat animals, he doesn’t
eat grass.

253
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:07,379
What to do?

254
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,799
He’s not a vegetarian!

255
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:15,049
God has made him like that so he accepts.

256
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:24,129
Now he goes and kills the cow or anything
then he leaves his kill there for the blood

257
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,159
to ooze out.

258
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:30,480
Nobody will touch that, nobody, because he’s
really the king.

259
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,489
Not out of fear but a protocol.

260
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:39,629
Then next day he goes [back], he eats, then
his family eats and all that; then finished

261
00:29:39,629 --> 00:29:43,700
for the whole month; they come out.

262
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,710
Then the lower animals start going there.

263
00:29:48,710 --> 00:30:03,029
Like you have 

264
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:07,630
leopards and all these animals come out and
they start eating.

265
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,629
And then even lower and lower till the birds.

266
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:15,570
Still the crow, they stay back.

267
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,110
Last are crows.

268
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,659
Can you imagine?

269
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:25,890
Such a system they have!

270
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:36,010
They go all the way from Siberia to Australia.

271
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,340
How do they manage?

272
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,169
Think of it.

273
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:43,039
What gives them direction is innocence.

274
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,529
And the innocence is a magnet.

275
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:48,419
It’s a magnet.

276
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,929
Actually it’s a magnet.

277
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:57,490
In a human being you do not find a magnet
because it has now evolved so much, but it

278
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,909
starts just like a magnet.

279
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:04,730
So they know which is north, which is south,
east and west.

280
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,899
Even a little bee, you find and put a mark
on it.

281
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:15,919
It goes to the place from where it has come.

282
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,100
How does it find its own way?

283
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:27,960
Is the innocence [which] is like a magnet,
acts like a magnet.

284
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,080
Even in the fishes.

285
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,360
Just imagine how fishes have direction!

286
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,390
We don’t have — I mean, human beings can
be lost.

287
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:47,480
Many times I am lost with so many drivers
I have had! (laughter) So many times I have

288
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:55,549
been lost but animals never.

289
00:31:55,549 --> 00:32:07,429
You know, if you take a dog and you don’t
want the dog, you leave him about fifty miles

290
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:10,850
away, he’ll come back.

291
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:15,279
How does he find the way?

292
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:25,950
So their qualities, which are built-in within
them through their innocence, are actually

293
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:34,869
the qualities of the electromagnetic force
and also pranava: that is when electromagnetic

294
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:39,869
force is charged with Ganesha’s Principle.

295
00:32:39,869 --> 00:32:50,340
That’s why they are so systematic, they
are so clean, they are so sensible.

296
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:56,640
But they are not ritualistic.

297
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,330
They are not ritualistic.

298
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,909
Whatever God has given them, they have accepted.

299
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:07,519
They are bound by that.

300
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:13,470
They are bound and they live with that boundary.

301
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:21,279
Even if you go up to the stage of animals
which live with human beings, they too, are

302
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,840
very affectionate.

303
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,460
They just want love, nothing else.

304
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:33,049
One day if you do not care for your dog, he
will just not eat his food, not eat his food,

305
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:36,720
he wouldn’t care for the food.

306
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:45,150
It is so remarkable, even I have seen among
children how they just want love.

307
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,559
They don’t accept anything else but love.

308
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:56,299
But as soon as they start growing up, specially
in a materialistic world, then the whole materialism

309
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:58,690
comes in.

310
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:07,150
So the second way we kill our children’s
innocence is putting materialistic ideas into

311
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,010
their heads.

312
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:15,679
Of course, the media is there which is selling,
nowadays, a teddy bear which has a birthday.

313
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,000
Teddy bear has a birthday!

314
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,149
Can you imagine?

315
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:23,690
So everybody is buying teddy bear with a birthday.

316
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:29,740
Because the parents don’t want to be in
the company of children so they get some sort

317
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:35,190
of a toys — this, that, one or two is alright
— and put them with the toys, with the television

318
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,310
on.

319
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:39,670
“Now, sit down!”

320
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:43,669
Children start becoming naturally materialistic.

321
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:59,300
They start asking for things and for demands
of such kind that sometimes one is surprised.

322
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:05,570
You take a Western child to the market and
you’ve had it!

323
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:09,350
But you take Indian children, they’ll never
take anything.

324
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,350
Really!

325
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,609
It’s so difficult to make them.

326
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,260
At least, I have seen my own grandchildren
and other.

327
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,940
You take them: it’s a headache to buy even
another pair of shoes for them.

328
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,290
“No, but we have one.

329
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,460
Why do you want to buy another?”

330
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,460
“Oh baba!

331
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,460
That will give way!”

332
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,710
“No, we can come here."

333
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,710
“How?”

334
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,850
“We can come in the car or else we can walk."

335
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,340
“But you will have no shoes [to walk]!”

336
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,340
“Nothing!

337
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,340
One is alright.

338
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
Why to have two?”

339
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:40,890
You give them money, they’ll buy one small
little thing and come home.

340
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:52,330
You see, it is the whole tradition of materialism
which has brought this innocence to a stop.

341
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:56,890
Then a child starts growing in the same materialistic
way.

342
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:04,450
He starts judging people like, “How many
cars you have?”

343
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,450
You see?

344
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:12,200
They are so stupidly materialistic that I
went to Boston and the television people asked

345
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,310
me, “How many Rolls Royces you have?”

346
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,320
I said, “I don’t have any."

347
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,870
They said, “We are not interested.

348
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:21,650
You are not in the business!”

349
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:29,520
This is what is now the mind of people in
the West who have grown up.

350
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,810
But even the children!

351
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,030
Today they want this, tomorrow they want that.

352
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:45,810
All the time there’s a competition for materialistic
things: asking for this, asking for that.

353
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:54,770
Just imagine what a race will be there, after
some years, when they will be just people

354
00:36:54,770 --> 00:37:02,280
who will be only worried about collecting
things and buying things: buyers and sellers,

355
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,930
nothing else.

356
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:15,200
So you have to be very careful with your children
that you do not pamper them, do not get too

357
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,640
much worried about them, do not keep them
on materialistic level.

358
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,730
Find out: if they are going on a materialistic
level, bring them down.

359
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:32,780
It’s very simple to do that and one has
to work it out because we have to save our

360
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,790
children and their innocence.

361
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:46,160
Now for the other Sahaja Yogis who are grown
up and who are very mature: they are very

362
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,430
innocent, I must say, I must admit that.

363
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:53,800
They are very innocent compared to the society
that is around, no doubt.

364
00:37:53,800 --> 00:38:01,430
One has to really admire the way they have
become so innocent, the way they are understanding

365
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:07,390
this divine music and all – it’s really
creditable.

366
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:17,460
But still, this innocence, if it is not spread,
if this innocence doesn’t work out, then

367
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,670
it will rust, will not grow.

368
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:25,420
Your IQ will be less than the others, I can
tell you this much.

369
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,530
They are growing in materialism all right.

370
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:38,370
Their IQ is growing in materialisms, but your
IQ will not grow unless and until you spread

371
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,400
this innocence around.

372
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,980
Now you know how to do it.

373
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:50,020
It is the power of Kundalini with the help
of Shri Ganesh.

374
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,480
He helps you at every chakra.

375
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,900
I have written that He is the Vice-Chancellor
of every university, where He has to stamp.

376
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,300
He’s at every point.

377
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:07,090
But you have to understand that this has to
spread.

378
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,510
It has to become collective.

379
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:13,630
It has to flow.

380
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:22,080
So to become that, what should we do ourselves?

381
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:30,360
That we should try to organise programmes.

382
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,970
While people will be enamoured by your innocence,
no doubt.

383
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:38,760
They’ll be surprised – how are you so
innocent?

384
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,690
How can you be so nice in these modern times?

385
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,000
No doubt about it.

386
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,890
But, in that doing that, try to be innocent
yourself.

387
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,870
You should not be cunning.

388
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,450
You should not be smart.

389
00:39:54,450 --> 00:40:00,850
You should not try to show that you are very
brilliant or anything because the ego might

390
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:05,900
come in between and try to put ideas into
your head.

391
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:13,080
It’s better to show that you are innocent
and to be innocent inside.

392
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:22,970
The whole inner being can be really charged
with the energy of Shri Ganesh, no doubt.

393
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:29,040
And the outer life becomes innocent; becomes
innocent.

394
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,050
I mean, I don’t know banking.

395
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,080
I don’t know money.

396
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,530
I am quite bad at everything, at worldly things.

397
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:46,970
But I am not cunning, I am not ‘smart’,
you can say.

398
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:54,900
But still things are working out because of
the inner power that one has.

399
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,770
So depend on your inner power and manifest
it outside.

400
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:08,240
Inner being, which is Ganesha, is the same
in all of us.

401
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,740
The whole system is the same in all of us.

402
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,310
Chakras are the same in all of us.

403
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:26,670
Only thing, we have to keep our innocence
absolutely free of all this worldly nonsense,

404
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:31,500
like fashion, this, that.

405
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:38,460
Immediately you will find that your being
will manifest; being will manifest.

406
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,520
Now just think of simple thing like that.

407
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:52,080
I am an Indian and nobody knows me but whenever
I have my lecture, I have at least five to

408
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,260
six thousand people.

409
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,260
How?

410
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,460
How do they come to my lecture like that?

411
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,630
Anywhere in the whole world.

412
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,630
Minimum.

413
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,430
Sometimes even much more.

414
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:09,370
What’s so special?

415
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:16,800
So when handling the people – we are Sahaja
Yogis, we are saints – we have to talk to

416
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:24,690
them like saints, we have to behave like saints.

417
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:30,780
And they should in no way feel that we are
cunning or we are interested in something

418
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,440
else.

419
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:43,250
So, once you start doing that, flowing your
innocence all the Gods and Goddesses will

420
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,250
help you.

421
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:55,530
Your creativity will be thousand times more
than normal.

422
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:57,980
Everybody has to think how we are going to
spread it.

423
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:03,030
Like I was happy to know that in America,
of all the places, they have got hold of these

424
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,030
senators.

425
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,710
Very good idea.

426
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:10,390
Let us see if it works out.

427
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:21,420
So we have to find out all the ways and methods
and all the styles which will behove a saint,

428
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,420
not a politician.

429
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,020
These days, of course, all the sports people
are heroes.

430
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:33,210
If you want to become a hero, you become a
sportsman.

431
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,470
Not like that, but like a saint.

432
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:45,090
And saintliness is respected, whatever may
be the situation, whatever may be the situation,

433
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,210
whosoever may be facing you.

434
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:53,900
Recently when I was in Kiev, the leaders wife
told me that, “Mother, we had that old car

435
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:59,380
of yours, which we sold and we got so much
money that we could buy a new car.

436
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,210
Then we went to the factory to buy the new
car."

437
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,220
And they bought it.

438
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,670
So outside the factory there’s a mafia.

439
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:14,300
Nowadays I think the Sicilians have reached
there!

440
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:20,610
So the mafia was standing outside and they
said, “You have to pay so much money to

441
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:21,610
us."

442
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:22,690
In thousands!

443
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,830
So they said, “We have no money."

444
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:25,960
“Why?

445
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,810
What do you do?”

446
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:28,880
This was his wife.

447
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,620
She said, “We meditate."

448
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,620
“Really?

449
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,620
So you have no money."

450
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,620
“No."

451
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,620
“What about those children?”

452
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,620
“They also meditate."

453
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:42,460
So innocently she was talking to them, they
said that, “We saw their faces melting down."

454
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,750
They said, “All right.

455
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,750
Go!”

456
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:51,450
They forgot that they were supposed to get
money out of them!

457
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,390
Or they take the car, they confiscate the
car or take the money.

458
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,050
They said, “All right.

459
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,050
Go!”

460
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,050
They told me this story.

461
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,640
So your simplicity always helps you.

462
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,960
Your innocence always helps you.

463
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,600
And it has such an impact, such an impact.

464
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:19,680
I tell you that a personality, what we call
in Sanskrit is a ‘vigraha’.

465
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,630
‘Vigraha’ means a personality which has
a coefficience.

466
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:36,530
The person who is innocent has such a great
coefficience that he can charm anybody.

467
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:44,550
But, first and foremost thing [is] that we
have to be innocent: not to so much worry

468
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:55,920
about money, not to count everything, not
to worry about food.

469
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,500
But this is not to be done with deliberations
but innocence.

470
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:06,300
Where you sleep, what you do is not important
to a saint.

471
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:13,420
It lives the way one has to live because his
nourishing point is innocence.

472
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:20,200
And he doesn’t get angry, he doesn’t shout
at people.

473
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,200
Nothing!

474
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:27,880
Of course, at bhoots it may be that he has
to shout like Christ did, but otherwise, he

475
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,830
is a very peaceful, joyous, happy, humorous
person.

476
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:41,921
So today, at this puja, I would bless you
with all the qualities of Shri Ganesha – except

477
00:46:41,921 --> 00:46:42,921
for His anger!

478
00:46:42,921 --> 00:46:44,740
May God bless you.
