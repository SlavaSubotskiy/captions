1
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:07,167
Birthday Puja 1984-0322, Bombay (India)

2
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:59,683
I have just told them (Indian Sahaja Yogis)
that you should not try to copy

3
00:32:59,892 --> 00:33:04,902
the western style of ego-oriented society
where people use harsh words,

4
00:33:05,103 --> 00:33:07,855
because then we think that we have
modernized ourselves, you see.

5
00:33:08,056 --> 00:33:13,123
To say harsh words to somebody,
“What do I care! I hate you!”

6
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:17,424
All these sentences we have never used,
you see, which is unknown to us.

7
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:20,116
I mean, anybody to say like that is
unmannerliness.

8
00:33:20,317 --> 00:33:22,582
How can you say such a thing:
“I hate you!”?

9
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:25,713
But now I have heard people talking like
this in our country.

10
00:33:25,914 --> 00:33:32,190
"I hate you." “What's wrong with us?”
“Who are you to say that?”

11
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:36,073
Like that we don't talk. You see, this is
not the way to talk at all.

12
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:38,968
Any person who comes from a good family

13
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:42,311
would not talk like this because it
reflects on the family.

14
00:33:42,512 --> 00:33:45,985
But the language is more copied here
than there.

15
00:33:46,186 --> 00:33:48,934
I am surprised sometimes when I hear
the people [how] they talk

16
00:33:49,135 --> 00:33:52,341
in the buses, in the taxies, in the things;

17
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:55,669
the way they use language is, you see,
is something I can’t understand.

18
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:58,696
So I have asked them that the language
should be full of love

19
00:33:58,897 --> 00:34:01,491
and with our own traditional style,
the way...

20
00:34:01,692 --> 00:34:04,068
You see, we wouldn’t even scold
our children.

21
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:08,204
If you have to scold the children, we use
a language

22
00:34:08,405 --> 00:34:13,209
which makes them over honourable
(Bahumanarthi):

23
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,258
[(Marathi)

24
00:34:16,459 --> 00:34:22,446
Damle Sahab has put on a kurta pyjama,
so, “You are looking like Shivaji Maharaj.

25
00:34:22,647 --> 00:34:24,399
Welcome Shivaji Maharaj”.

26
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,267
We should speak in such respectful language
so that they would not get scared.

27
00:34:28,468 --> 00:34:31,591
Correction if it is to be done], we used
to do it this way;

28
00:34:31,792 --> 00:34:37,379
but the correction of the other side is not
proper because that never it corrects.

29
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,861
You see, that’s why you cannot control
your children.

30
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:44,127
You are all the time insulting them,
insulting others, insulting methods,

31
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:47,901
you see, and this emotional blackmail
and all this nonsense

32
00:34:48,102 --> 00:34:51,248
is not at all traditional in this country.

33
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:53,262
And those who'll try to do it will be
thrown out.

34
00:34:53,463 --> 00:34:56,017
I can tell you, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot
work out.

35
00:34:56,218 --> 00:35:00,093
You should not have all these ideas
of insulting people,

36
00:35:00,294 --> 00:35:04,338
of bringing them into situations where they
can be insulted. This is all modern style.

37
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:07,676
So we should not do like that
in Sahaja Yoga.

38
00:35:07,877 --> 00:35:12,498
We should behave in such a way that
we should be dignified people.

39
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:17,445
Behoving our style is our tradition,
is Sahaja Yogis' tradition is this

40
00:35:17,646 --> 00:35:20,920
that we talk to people in the most
sophisticated manner,

41
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:27,035
in the sweetest manner, in the most
affectionate manner and inviting manner.

42
00:35:27,236 --> 00:35:30,341
And that is how we all should speak.
So, this is [the] first thing I ask

43
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:32,772
that in your expression of your love

44
00:35:32,957 --> 00:35:35,648
there should not be a thing that you
should shout.

45
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:38,651
Now, I do shout at some people who have
bhoots in them,

46
00:35:38,852 --> 00:35:44,294
but by that the bhoots run away. But if
you shout, you get the bhoots.

47
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:48,218
The bhoots don't run away, they get
at you; so better not do it.

48
00:35:48,419 --> 00:35:50,673
If you have My powers you can do that;
but you don’t have.

49
00:35:50,874 --> 00:35:55,092
If you shout at the person who has bhoots,
you get the bhoots.

50
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:59,934
So be careful, don’t try My tricks. You
see, I am a different type of a person

51
00:36:00,135 --> 00:36:03,221
and I do everything so understandingly,
which you do not.

52
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:07,311
So, when you follow Me, you should
follow Me the way I am,

53
00:36:07,512 --> 00:36:09,856
on the side where I forgive,

54
00:36:10,057 --> 00:36:13,873
the way I am loving, I am affectionate;
not where I am terrible.

55
00:36:14,074 --> 00:36:18,123
You shouldn't do that because My terrible
nature has got the undercurrent

56
00:36:18,324 --> 00:36:21,139
of My Love, which you don’t have,
and you don’t have these powers.

57
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:23,805
So don’t try those tricks with anybody
else.

58
00:36:24,006 --> 00:36:27,061
You have no right to shout at anyone
or to get angry,

59
00:36:27,262 --> 00:36:30,619
because if you shout, you get back
all these bhoots into you.

60
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,647
They want, they provoke you. They provoke
you so that you get caught up into it

61
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:38,535
and you get absolutely ruined, the more
you try to do it.

62
00:36:38,736 --> 00:36:45,807
So, the best thing is to stand in
the centre and have affection and love -

63
00:36:46,023 --> 00:36:49,956
the power that I have given you. That you
have [to] develop - that power of love.

64
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:53,657
First you develop that power of love.
Then you don’t have to worry,

65
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:56,525
you don’t have to shout, you don't have
to say anything.

66
00:36:56,726 --> 00:37:01,237
Your power will become the Krita (active),
it will work out itself

67
00:37:01,438 --> 00:37:04,711
and create that beautiful atmosphere
that we want to do.

68
00:37:04,912 --> 00:37:06,769
We don't want anybody to be ruined.

69
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,808
But if you start shouting at people,
they’ll all run away.

70
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:14,020
Specially in the ego-oriented society,
you should not shout at all!

71
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:16,032
That will not appeal to anyone.

72
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:19,535
If you shout at anyone in the ego-oriented
society,

73
00:37:19,736 --> 00:37:22,189
you will always distract them and they'll
run away.

74
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:26,194
So I have to tell you, that you might be
the highest of highest,

75
00:37:26,395 --> 00:37:30,675
first thing [that] you have to give Me
today is that in your talk,

76
00:37:30,876 --> 00:37:37,385
in your behaviour, in your heart, you will
reside one with Love.

77
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:42,002
And the second thing I want to ask is that
you should be peaceful people.

78
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:45,734
Try to have peace with yourself.
Don’t fight with yourself.

79
00:37:45,935 --> 00:37:50,214
Now, the western people have one problem
[that] they fight with themselves.

80
00:37:50,415 --> 00:37:53,652
“How is it this is happening to me?
I am so bad. I am no good.

81
00:37:53,853 --> 00:37:55,383
I have done this. I am so bad.”

82
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,044
If you go on fighting with yourself,
then you will become week.

83
00:37:59,245 --> 00:38:01,922
On the contrary, you must say, “I am
so good. What’s wrong with me?

84
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,651
I’ve got realization. What’s wrong with me?

85
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:07,294
Have that confidence in oneself, and then
it will work out.

86
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:10,810
And as result of that only you start
shouting at others.

87
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:13,220
But supposing you understand

88
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:16,397
that there is nothing wrong with you,
you have to be peaceful.

89
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:19,582
We all have to be very peaceful people
and you have seen,

90
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:23,737
My peaceful nature has solved so many
problems just like that.

91
00:38:23,938 --> 00:38:29,530
So try to achieve that peace within you.
That peace should not be lost at any cost,

92
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:34,048
and should not be also expressed outside
in a way, like I sometimes.

93
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:38,069
My peace itself becomes terrible.

94
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:41,859
But you don’t have that kind of
a possibility, so you just don’t do it.

95
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,713
You just don’t do it, never do it that way.

96
00:38:44,914 --> 00:38:50,574
Try to be extremely peaceful, try to make
your forehead relaxed.

97
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:53,341
Many people come to Me with [face]
like this, you see,

98
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:56,607
then I just know that there is a big bhoot
on the head sitting;

99
00:38:56,808 --> 00:38:58,788
then I shout at them.

100
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:01,778
Keep your forehead relaxed, relaxed.

101
00:39:01,979 --> 00:39:05,646
“I am not doing anything, Mother is doing
everything. Relax, relax, relax.”

102
00:39:05,847 --> 00:39:11,384
If you relax, you’ll find that your heart
will open.

103
00:39:11,585 --> 00:39:14,952
“My heart cannot open.” Why, why can’t
you open your heart?

104
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:18,567
Because you have no trust in yourself.

105
00:39:18,768 --> 00:39:23,199
Try to trust yourself, open your Agnya,
open your Ekadasha

106
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,154
and your Sahasrara, and your heart will
open. Once your Sahasrara is open,

107
00:39:29,355 --> 00:39:33,416
your heart will open automatically, so
you will have a peaceful life.

108
00:39:33,617 --> 00:39:36,341
So today I am asking for two things
from you.

109
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:39,778
It's a funny thing that a Mother has to ask
for a gift.

110
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:44,317
And the gift you have to give - first one -
is that you should be peaceful people.

111
00:39:44,518 --> 00:39:49,520
You should express peacefulness through
your own character, talking.

112
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:54,183
But it doesn't mean that you should be
people who are bleak,

113
00:39:54,384 --> 00:40:00,915
or who are - we can say that - are
morbid people

114
00:40:01,116 --> 00:40:05,577
or people who tolerate nonsense.
No, there is a way of resistance.

115
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:09,576
But a resistance, of a peaceful resistance,
that you are not afraid of anything;

116
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:13,078
you are not frightened of anything; you are
not going to bow down to anything;

117
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:17,048
you are not going to compromise with
anything, but you are peaceful.

118
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:20,833
That sort of a temperament you must
develop

119
00:40:21,034 --> 00:40:23,523
and also express outside, is very
important.

120
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:33,426
And [the] second one is the..., this peace
and all this

121
00:40:33,627 --> 00:40:38,492
should express your love to others,
love to others.

122
00:40:38,693 --> 00:40:42,554
Like now, everywhere, within next one
or two years we'll have ashrams,

123
00:40:42,755 --> 00:40:46,169
I am sure of that. And in the ashram,
I would like to see

124
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:52,564
people having loving, caring, affectionate,
patronising,

125
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:56,028
beautiful attitude towards the people who
come there.

126
00:40:56,238 --> 00:41:00,160
On the contrary, if you do not have, your
ashrams will be all reduced to zero.

127
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:03,118
It has happened in many places; it will
happen everywhere.

128
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:06,241
So, you don’t blame Me, “Why our ashrams
don’t run good?”

129
00:41:06,442 --> 00:41:10,642
It will be your responsibility to see that
it is your Mother’s House

130
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:16,986
and people are coming to the Mother’s
House. And how a Mother would treat

131
00:41:17,187 --> 00:41:20,404
these people with love, affection,
with whatever you have.

132
00:41:20,605 --> 00:41:23,687
You can starve, but give to others,
look after them.

133
00:41:23,911 --> 00:41:28,667
Give them all the kindness and sweetness,
so the impression of people...

134
00:41:28,868 --> 00:41:31,908
Even if you are slightest not like that,
people will think,

135
00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:34,919
"This is a very arrogant personality.
And how can it be?"

136
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,408
So you have to be a top class person to be
in charge of an ashram.

137
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:42,361
If a person who is a mediocre, he should
not appoint.

138
00:41:42,562 --> 00:41:46,380
By God’s grace, I'm sure, by next year
you'll have all the lands in your hand,

139
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:51,226
and all your ashrams will start by next
year in every country.

140
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:54,079
May God bless you.

141
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,124
This is what I give you on My birthday
today

142
00:41:57,325 --> 00:42:02,619
that you all will have your ashrams properly
established by the end of next year.

143
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,197
But first two things you must...,
the conditions are there.

144
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:09,659
First two conditions should be there.
If you are not good for that,

145
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,982
God will never give you an ashram,

146
00:42:12,183 --> 00:42:15,939
because He doesn’t want to give ashram
to some funny people.

147
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,552
It's become sort of a recluse for people
who have no place anywhere

148
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:22,354
[to] come and sit in the ashram.

149
00:42:22,555 --> 00:42:24,900
So unless and until you have people
of that level,

150
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:29,617
who will remain peaceful and loving,
you will not establish.

151
00:42:29,818 --> 00:42:33,545
But if you do, I’m sure, by next year
you should be able

152
00:42:33,746 --> 00:42:36,624
to have ashrams in every place.

153
00:42:36,848 --> 00:42:39,546
May God Bless you.
