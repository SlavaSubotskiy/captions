1
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:55,629
Who is going to find out?

2
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:59,139
[UNCLEAR]

3
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:02,769
Australia or to say your

4
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,179
country

5
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:07,079
which is very good at

6
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:09,697
getting all the black money.

7
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:13,019
to Switzerland.

8
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,679
[UNCLEAR] stupid things are done.

9
00:27:18,524 --> 00:27:19,524


10
00:27:20,644 --> 00:27:23,624
What is the need to allow the money to

11
00:27:23,624 --> 00:27:26,064
go out of [UNCLEAR] I don't understand

12
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,930
cash money, you see

13
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,599


14
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,479
that only has black market.

15
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:40,209


16
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:44,889
[UNCLEAR] maybe taxation binds

17
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:46,639
military things.

18
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:49,119
You tax someone

19
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,759
all right, you tax for something sensible, nobody minds

20
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:55,629
but for buying military things and then seeking [UNCLEAR]

21
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:58,279
What's the use?

22
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:01,024
While your hard-earned money

23
00:28:01,424 --> 00:28:03,944
the tax payer is going in the

24
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:06,364
see of [UNCLEAR]

25
00:28:11,484 --> 00:28:12,604
[UNCLEAR] Where are you two going?

26
00:28:14,604 --> 00:28:16,824
She is buying all these materials,

27
00:28:17,124 --> 00:28:19,324
more materials, [UNCLEAR] finished.

28
00:28:22,104 --> 00:28:25,524
Then, its also, you see, a double solver

29
00:28:26,244 --> 00:28:28,584
also these horrible Argentinians

30
00:28:29,024 --> 00:28:31,044
people who killed their own people

31
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:33,519
are being punished now.

32
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:43,949
All these dictators are [UNCLEAR] punished.

33
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:45,209
That's a very good thing.

34
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,879
They needed some punishment.

35
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:53,469
Why is she the person who is harmed because she was collecting

36
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:57,744
She started this, and another is America.

37
00:28:57,744 --> 00:29:00,924
[UNCLEAR] be in trouble. [I will see that UNCLEAR]

38
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:01,924
very soon.

39
00:29:06,464 --> 00:29:07,464


40
00:29:11,844 --> 00:29:12,844


41
00:29:14,144 --> 00:29:15,924
Russia is in trouble too.

42
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:22,224
It will work out, you will see that.

43
00:29:23,524 --> 00:29:25,804
You don't realize how [UNCLEAR]

44
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:32,999


45
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,039


46
00:29:40,624 --> 00:29:41,624


47
00:29:44,684 --> 00:29:47,184
She [UNCLEAR] for ten people [UNCLEAR]

48
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:51,124
finished.

49
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:54,409


50
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:56,524
I will get you small plates for biscuits and cheese Mother.

51
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:59,889


52
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:01,869


53
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:04,909


54
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:07,519


55
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,684


56
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:18,664
May I keep this as prasad?

57
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:23,124


58
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,229


59
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:32,619


60
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:42,459


61
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:51,564


62
00:30:59,644 --> 00:31:01,784
I think now there will be a revolution.

63
00:31:02,124 --> 00:31:04,384
in Argentina and

64
00:31:04,784 --> 00:31:05,804
[Chile ? UNCLEAR]

65
00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:10,004
In Argentina and

66
00:31:12,144 --> 00:31:13,184
Chile.

67
00:31:13,584 --> 00:31:15,024
[UNCLEAR]

68
00:31:18,124 --> 00:31:19,124
Did you follow?

69
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:23,299
She just doesn't follow. What's the matter?

70
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:24,709


71
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:27,989
I said there will be a revolution now.

72
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:31,619
I don't know. [UNCLEAR]

73
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:33,719
[UNCLEAR]

74
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,289
It's too good.

75
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:39,609
You see

76
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:45,609


77
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:52,539
But no communism. You see the trouble was

78
00:31:53,149 --> 00:31:55,389
these people were going to communism.

79
00:31:56,939 --> 00:32:00,059
If they had gone for democracy, [UNCLEAR]

80
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:03,409
Because communism is no solution at all.

81
00:32:04,584 --> 00:32:06,744
It's much worse than dictatorship.

82
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:11,604
[UNCLEAR]

83
00:32:12,304 --> 00:32:15,224
Yogi: The communist not believe in God. Mataji: Not at all.

84
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:17,919
[UNCLEAR] What's the use of having communism?

85
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,359


86
00:32:20,324 --> 00:32:21,324


87
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:25,724
Yogi: They are very materialistic even.

88
00:32:25,924 --> 00:32:26,924
Mataji: Very materialistic.

89
00:32:28,524 --> 00:32:32,684
And this was the mistake of Chile people and Argentina people to ask for communism.

90
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:35,584


91
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:38,849
Communist wouldn't even know what has happened.

92
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:44,864
Nice to see communism from far.

93
00:32:45,984 --> 00:32:47,124
How communism?

94
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:50,824
That was a mistake.

95
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,819
Chile people are slo stupid.

96
00:33:14,824 --> 00:33:17,104
They don't understand what communism is.

97
00:33:18,424 --> 00:33:20,684
Russia will just come and sit on their head.

98
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,584
Whatever happened to Poland see.

99
00:33:24,464 --> 00:33:27,104
Czechoslovakia finished, Poland finished.

100
00:33:27,624 --> 00:33:29,184
It could finish too.

101
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:34,859
Afghanistan tried to [UNCLEAR] something.

102
00:33:34,864 --> 00:33:35,864
They are sitting on their heads now.

103
00:33:37,344 --> 00:33:38,344


104
00:33:38,904 --> 00:33:41,084
Only the Indians are saved.

105
00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:54,269
Yogi: Now the church.

106
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:57,559
Yogi: The Church in Chile, they are very political Mother.

107
00:33:59,149 --> 00:34:01,589
Mataji: Church? Yogi:Yes.

108
00:34:01,589 --> 00:34:03,364
[UNCLEAR] What about your Pope?

109
00:34:04,164 --> 00:34:06,184
[UNCLEAR] a political stunt.

110
00:34:08,764 --> 00:34:11,799
He said,"I don't want any war."

111
00:34:11,804 --> 00:34:12,884
I mean, who wants war?

112
00:34:14,224 --> 00:34:17,924
What is the need to say, "I don't want any war"? But give some solution.

113
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:20,724
What is the solution?

114
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:24,859
I don't want to be involved, everything is to be done peacefully.

115
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:27,999
For that you don't need a Pope to say that.

116
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,179


117
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:46,439
Church is for teaching them Capitalism.

118
00:34:48,029 --> 00:34:49,029


119
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:54,409
Yogi: Catholic ..

120
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:57,364
How they? from the left people..

121
00:34:57,724 --> 00:35:00,544


122
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:03,424
Yogi: Communist people Mother.

123
00:35:03,424 --> 00:35:04,764
They [help?] the Communist.

124
00:35:05,244 --> 00:35:07,204
The communist people they [killed?]

125
00:35:08,264 --> 00:35:10,504
They killed this and they killed this, that's all.

126
00:35:13,764 --> 00:35:15,264
So, they are just the same.

127
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,884
What was your Mother's [UNCLEAR] Communism?

128
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:28,939


129
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:31,609
That's [UNCLEAR] stupidity.

130
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:36,119
[UNCLEAR believe in communism.

131
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:39,199
[UNCLEAR]

132
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,159
[UNCLEAR]

133
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,559


134
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,249


135
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:47,989
Yogi: In 1970

136
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:51,309
until 1970, I was [UNCLEAR] this [UNCLEAR]

137
00:35:52,179 --> 00:35:55,259
I was very active in Politics.

138
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,889
Because my

139
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,259


140
00:36:00,649 --> 00:36:02,939
mother [UNCLEAR]  and myself

141
00:36:02,939 --> 00:36:06,249
to do politics since.

142
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:09,609
So [UNCLEAR]  and myself you were communist?

143
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:13,659
I was [UNCLEAR]   You worked for communist that time? I was socialist.

144
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:15,879
Yes communist.

145
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:19,209
See, now you see the stupidity of communism is there.

146
00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:20,439
Complete.

147
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:22,929
That was the mistake.

148
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:26,009
[UNCLEAR]

149
00:36:27,689 --> 00:36:29,509
They don't understand God at all.

150
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,139
They are absurd people.

151
00:36:34,624 --> 00:36:35,539


152
00:36:35,544 --> 00:36:38,584
Sahajayoga would have never reached to [UNCLEAR]  were a communist.

153
00:36:44,404 --> 00:36:46,444
Of course, now, you have given up all your political.

154
00:36:46,889 --> 00:36:48,409
[UNCLEAR]

155
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:51,589
He too was.

156
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:53,539


157
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:55,049
I was never

158
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:58,139
very much into. Mataji: But your brothers and sisters, were [UNCLEAR]  ?

159
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:00,269
He is married.

160
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:03,759
Wendy is

161
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:12,189
Geraldo's sister. Wendy is married with my brother, so the relation is, he is my

162
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:15,004
My brother is married with Geraldo's sister.

163
00:37:15,009 --> 00:37:17,799


164
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:20,769
Mataji: Rodrigo is your brother?

165
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:22,829
Mataji: So Rodrigo's wife is Wendy? Yogi: Yes.

166
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:25,759
[Yogis and Mataji talk about relations]

167
00:37:26,049 --> 00:37:27,049


168
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:29,384


169
00:37:30,644 --> 00:37:33,184
[UNCLEAR]

170
00:37:33,944 --> 00:37:37,224


171
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,259


172
00:37:48,764 --> 00:37:49,764


173
00:37:54,904 --> 00:37:57,789
All these things should be understood in the light of the spirit.

174
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:58,784


175
00:38:01,669 --> 00:38:02,799
It's difficult to understand.

176
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:08,369


177
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,609
Without democracy you cannot have realization.

178
00:38:10,029 --> 00:38:11,029
Cannot work out.

179
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:14,419
I cannot go to any country which is communist.

180
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:16,549
And do sahajayoga.

181
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:20,119
Nor can I go to any country where there is [UNCLEAR]  rule

182
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:21,664


183
00:38:21,984 --> 00:38:25,444
So both are useless. Only democratic countries we can work out.

184
00:38:28,564 --> 00:38:31,339
We have thought we have done, you see,

185
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:34,069
We have gone to France, Portugal, all these people are democratic.

186
00:38:35,459 --> 00:38:37,739
[UNCLEAR]  communism had [UNCLEAR]

187
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,359


188
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:07,049


189
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:08,499


190
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,639


191
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,439


192
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:12,749


193
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,519


194
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:17,349


195
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:18,659


196
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:19,659


197
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:20,989


198
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:22,019


199
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,239


200
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:28,289


201
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:29,549


202
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:31,549
This is what it is.

203
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:34,629
Very wrong misleading

204
00:39:34,629 --> 00:39:36,849
things these are.

205
00:39:37,299 --> 00:39:38,299


206
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:39,579


207
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:40,589


208
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:42,249


209
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:43,979


210
00:39:43,979 --> 00:39:44,979


211
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:50,139


212
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:53,439


213
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,209


214
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,739


215
00:40:10,504 --> 00:40:11,504


216
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,684
The car fellow was just changing everything

217
00:40:23,684 --> 00:40:26,164
he was cheating.

218
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:31,409
First he said something, and he changed everything horrible people.

219
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:32,869


220
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:34,169


221
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,759
They are always trying to get your money.

222
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:39,149
Spanish, you see, have worse

223
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:42,499
worst are these [UNCLEAR].

224
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:43,889


225
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:45,439
what you call Italians.

226
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:48,419
They are the worst, terrible.

227
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:51,859
Portuguese are very good people compared to Spanish actually.

228
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:55,459
They are very good people, they don't cheat you, they trust you.

229
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:57,689
They are very good people.

230
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:01,069
We went to

231
00:41:02,979 --> 00:41:04,909
[UNCLEAR]   place

232
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:06,299
[UNCLEAR]

233
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:08,199
We wanted to buy some marbles

234
00:41:11,024 --> 00:41:13,744
[UNCLEAR]   small small pieces, small of marbles

235
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,244
First, they said [UNCLEAR]

236
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,379
[UNCLEAR]  I mean really went on.

237
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:22,329
All increasing decreasing, ever expanding,

238
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:25,339
every sort of thing, you know. I got so fed up.

239
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:28,219
I went to 2 or 3 shops, [UNCLEAR]   these people, horrible.

240
00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:31,179
Such a waste of time, you see. Then I  just thought

241
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:34,109
I said, "If the Italians" [UNCLEAR]

242
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:37,269
[UNCLEAR]  she [UNCLEAR] in 5 minutes.

243
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,199
Got the whole thing very cheap.

244
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:46,119
Such liars actually, terrible liars.

245
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:53,459
I said this, I said that, unnecessary.

246
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:03,399
Where have we parked the car?

247
00:42:05,244 --> 00:42:06,884


248
00:42:07,724 --> 00:42:09,424
It's convenient.

249
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:24,424


250
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:35,479


251
00:42:35,949 --> 00:42:36,949


252
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:46,629
Yogi: I have just received

253
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:48,799
[UNCLEAR]

254
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:52,399
from England.

255
00:42:52,399 --> 00:42:54,679
I have just received a call from England.

256
00:42:55,479 --> 00:42:56,649
My wife,

257
00:42:57,499 --> 00:42:59,089
she has been bleeding

258
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,179
and

259
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:04,399
they don't know what is ...?

260
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:08,529
Mataji: She has been bleeding? Yogi:Yes Mother. Mother: How many months it is?

261
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:10,369
Yogi:It's been 5 months Mother.

262
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:15,669
Mataji: That's very [UNCLEAR]

263
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:18,709
is such a common trouble.

264
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:23,729
Mataji: Many reasons are there for that.

265
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:27,189
Some of them is that, they use those pills, you see.

266
00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:32,949
She maybe alright.

267
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:37,079
anyway its common  [UNCLEAR]

268
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:38,459
bleeding

269
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:43,609
Who else? I mean everybody had this trouble.

270
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:46,529
She is  [getting too much UNCLEAR]

271
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:50,189
She said it was quite a lot.

272
00:43:50,189 --> 00:43:51,939
She said it was quite a lot and

273
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:55,299
if it carried on tonight, they would take her to hospital.

274
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,139
It's an ordinary case.

275
00:43:58,264 --> 00:44:00,464
Nothing so extra ordinary.

276
00:44:02,524 --> 00:44:05,224
Is it too much or less?

277
00:44:05,224 --> 00:44:06,744
Yogi: She said it was a lot.

278
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:09,039
Yogi: She said it was a lot.

279
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:10,489
Mataji: It was a lot?

280
00:44:11,169 --> 00:44:14,169
Mataji: She talked to you? Yogi: Yes Mother,  she called me.

281
00:44:14,689 --> 00:44:16,099


282
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:18,299
Mataji: Now what did she  [UNCLEAR]  what do you  [UNCLEAR]

283
00:44:29,004 --> 00:44:30,004


284
00:44:30,444 --> 00:44:32,024
Mataji: You should have told her that

285
00:44:32,784 --> 00:44:34,204
you have done sahaja yoga.

286
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:35,809
Should have been better.

287
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:39,949
Did you say that? Pray to Mother?

288
00:44:41,169 --> 00:44:42,209
Yogi: I did say Mother.

289
00:44:43,399 --> 00:44:46,559
She was having all these troubles because

290
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,559
she doesn't do sahaja yoga.

291
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:53,329
How did you get the [UNCLEAR] ?

292
00:44:53,879 --> 00:44:56,929
Yogi: When I was, told to call

293
00:44:56,929 --> 00:44:58,369
urgently to England.

294
00:44:59,189 --> 00:45:00,189


295
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:01,849


296
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:11,539


297
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:15,379
Also she might have lifted something, or something like that.

298
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,379
You see.

299
00:45:20,499 --> 00:45:23,809
[UNCLEAR] I can't understand too much.

300
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:28,849
Because they start little bit little bit like that you see.

301
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:32,689
It's suddenly too much then there must be something she has done.

302
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:34,409
with careless [UNCLEAR]

303
00:45:56,839 --> 00:45:58,919
Mataji: What about your father?

304
00:45:59,449 --> 00:46:00,849
Yogi: He is in Chile now.

305
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:03,509
Yogi: He is [UNCLEAR] with my mother.

306
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:05,759
He is divorced.

307
00:46:06,449 --> 00:46:09,139
He separated from my mother.

308
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:11,979
He live in Chile Mother.

309
00:46:11,979 --> 00:46:12,979
Mataji: With another woman? Yogi:Yes Mother.

310
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:17,959


311
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:21,749
You remember him ?

312
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:24,819
He left when you were young or ?

313
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:28,249
Yogi: Actually, my mother left him because

314
00:46:28,249 --> 00:46:30,909
he was horrible. In 1970

315
00:46:30,909 --> 00:46:33,919
[UNCLEAR]

316
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:40,389
better for children to separate, And she separate, otherwise we

317
00:46:40,389 --> 00:46:42,259
would be crazy.

318
00:46:42,709 --> 00:46:46,059
[UNCLEAR]

319
00:46:46,379 --> 00:46:49,159


320
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:50,919


321
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:54,119

322
00:46:54,129 --> 00:46:56,069
last two years.

323
00:46:56,449 --> 00:46:59,139


324
00:46:59,139 --> 00:47:01,519
I write him and I tell him

325
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:03,499
sahaja yoga

326
00:47:03,499 --> 00:47:05,969
[UNCLEAR]

00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:08,679
[UNCLEAR]

328
00:47:12,939 --> 00:47:15,409
Mataji: When did she join politics? Your mother?

329
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:18,669
Mataji: When did she join politics? Your mother?

330
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:21,699
Yogi: My mother was [UNCLEAR] in politics.

331
00:47:21,699 --> 00:47:23,649


332
00:47:23,649 --> 00:47:26,729
Yogi: My mother is very political, so that's why they are in trouble.

333
00:47:27,459 --> 00:47:30,519


334
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,229
he doesn't [UNCLEAR] in political.

335
00:47:34,299 --> 00:47:36,369
[UNCLEAR]

336
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:39,599
Mataji: She [UNCLEAR] communist?

337
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:43,169


338
00:47:43,169 --> 00:47:45,859
Yogi: from when my mother was 25.

339
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:48,809
something like that.

340
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:52,869
[UNCLEAR]

341
00:47:56,149 --> 00:47:57,149

343
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,264
Mataji: Can you [UNCLEAR]?

344
00:48:02,884 --> 00:48:03,884
[UNCLEAR]

345
00:50:29,544 --> 00:50:31,244
[Visuddhi?] is on this joint,

347
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:35,904
Put some balm there.

348
00:50:39,064 --> 00:50:40,064

If you have got Lalita Sahashranama, you don't have to do anything.

[UNCLEAR] they don't know anything, do they talk? They don't talk of kundalini.

They don't know anything. I mean they don't even have the knowledge.

Leave alone anything.

01:01:28,021 --> 01:01:30,791
Mataji: This is the side of [Buddha UNCLEAR] These are Ekadasha.

514
01:01:31,111 --> 01:01:33,841
11, one of them is Mahavira.

515
01:01:49,326 --> 01:01:50,326
[UNCLEAR] is the back agya?

516
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:14,706
See the Spirit.

517
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:16,746
that's how his eyes are.

518
01:02:19,651 --> 01:02:21,731
This is [UNCLEAR], this is spirit you see.

519
01:02:22,446 --> 01:02:24,846
You seek all the questions.

520
01:02:25,226 --> 01:02:27,861
[UNCLEAR]

521
01:02:27,861 --> 01:02:31,111
You see there is a, they become you see.

522
01:02:32,946 --> 01:02:36,166
Like a prism, they start giving you many many

523
01:02:36,806 --> 01:02:38,006
images, this that.

524
01:02:41,286 --> 01:02:42,666
This is spirit inside you.

525
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:51,261
Yogi: 7 [UNCLEAR]?

526
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:53,391
5 or 7? Mataji:5.

527
01:02:56,221 --> 01:02:57,301
[UNCLEAR]

528
01:03:00,411 --> 01:03:01,411
Mataji: He has read a lot.

529
01:03:04,551 --> 01:03:07,381
What he is doing is [UNCLEAR] isn't it? Yogi: Thank you very much.

530
01:03:07,706 --> 01:03:09,726
Mataji: He is realizing it's different

531
01:03:11,206 --> 01:03:14,006
Yogi: Thank you. Mataji: Yes.

532
01:03:15,726 --> 01:03:21,706
There's a book we have got, I will give you one. All right? You go through that. [UNCLEAR] give him that book.

533
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:26,326
But now, you establish sahaja yoga here, all right?

534
01:03:32,486 --> 01:03:35,266
You have got a house or some work? Have you got a

535
01:03:35,526 --> 01:03:38,646
room or somewhere to stay? Yogi: I live alone [UNCLEAR] Mataji: Where?

536
01:03:39,146 --> 01:03:41,266
Yogi: In here in Madrid.

537
01:03:42,946 --> 01:03:46,606
I live in a flat by myself. Mataji: Yourself? Yogi: Because I am a brahmachari.

538
01:03:47,501 --> 01:03:48,501


539
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,181
Mataji: All right, we will see your brahmacharya.

540
01:03:54,881 --> 01:03:55,881
Mataji: With the Mother

541
01:03:56,101 --> 01:03:58,961
when you try the brahmacharya, I will put you to trouble.

542
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:04,186
Yogi: With [UNCLEAR], who is the [UNCLEAR] ?

543
01:04:04,806 --> 01:04:05,806
Mataji: No no, what I am saying

544
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:07,471
if you try any

545
01:04:08,966 --> 01:04:10,746
brahmacharya, you see

546
01:04:11,106 --> 01:04:14,246
Mother is a playful thing, she plays, see,

547
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:15,931
isn't it?

548
01:04:18,346 --> 01:04:19,346
She is Kalawati.

549
01:04:19,906 --> 01:04:23,246
kala, very artistic, kundalini.

550
01:04:23,406 --> 01:04:25,026
She plays art with you.

551
01:04:25,226 --> 01:04:28,241
And she tries to bring you round, you see.

552
01:04:28,241 --> 01:04:30,771
All these ideas of brahmacharya will vanish soon.

553
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:35,691
Yogi: I see, I need to raise my kundalini sooner.

554
01:04:35,826 --> 01:04:38,666
Mataji: No, no no. You are [UNCLEAR] there on top of your head. Just see.

555
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:42,866
It's already risen, when are you going to rise? See yourself now.

556
01:04:44,086 --> 01:04:46,426
Feel it in your head, just come on

557
01:04:48,466 --> 01:04:51,126
All right? You don't have to rise anymore.

558
01:04:53,026 --> 01:04:54,106
But

559
01:04:55,246 --> 01:05:00,826
Now, if you get married, then realized souls are to be born, you know many realized souls are to be born.

560
01:05:01,206 --> 01:05:02,206
All right?

561
01:05:02,241 --> 01:05:03,981
Souls are to be born.

562
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:18,651
Yogi: I have to find my Vairabhi.

563
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:22,086
Mataji: Vairab, all right.

564
01:05:25,606 --> 01:05:28,046
You will find in a sahaja yogini, a good one, all right?

565
01:05:28,406 --> 01:05:31,426
Don't worry. Now, you will, you will definitely.

566
01:05:32,246 --> 01:05:33,246
Now, see

567
01:05:36,286 --> 01:05:37,286
this is the book.

568
01:05:41,906 --> 01:05:45,886
Yogi: Oh heaven, thank you Mother. Mataji: I will write it down your name.

569
01:05:53,931 --> 01:05:55,311
Are you peaceful? Ask him.

570
01:05:57,101 --> 01:05:58,101


571
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:01,791
Is there still thoughts?

572
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:03,791


573
01:06:05,001 --> 01:06:06,001


574
01:06:06,401 --> 01:06:07,691
He is not thinking?

575
01:06:12,766 --> 01:06:15,546
Ekadasha very strong. It will work out.

576
01:06:17,706 --> 01:06:18,706
You are all right.

577
01:06:19,151 --> 01:06:21,451
[UNCLEAR] thing would want to take it out.

578
01:06:25,831 --> 01:06:26,861
Now, rejoin your self.

579
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:30,031


580
01:06:30,771 --> 01:06:31,771

584
01:06:52,546 --> 01:06:54,846
You should make it a point to come to England.

585
01:06:55,501 --> 01:06:58,001
Yogi: I lived two years in England but Ieft.

586
01:06:59,351 --> 01:07:02,441
I would like to go back and see. Mataji: Oh yes, you must come.

587
01:07:02,441 --> 01:07:05,441
Mataji: And let me know first, you take my address from these people.

588
01:07:05,441 --> 01:07:07,391
in the Ashram, we have a very beautiful Ashram.

589
