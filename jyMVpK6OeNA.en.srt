1
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:24,240
but first and foremost thing is to

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,310
meditate and to raise your meditation is

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,040
the only way you can grow there's no

4
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,130
other way out because when you meditate

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,120
you are in silence you are in

6
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,250
thoughtless awareness then the growth of

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,800
awareness takes place then it opens on

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,629
but if you are thinking supposing

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,290
there's a lake and the lake is

10
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:49,769
completely in a turmoil nothing can grow

11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:51,629
but supposing it is silent then lotuses

12
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:53,750
can grow and if you can grow in it in

13
00:00:51,629 --> 00:01:00,229
the same way if your mind is agitated

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:04,610
and your growth is not yet fully

15
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:08,940
expressing itself then it's such a

16
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:11,490
vicious circle that you are agitated and

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,250
your growth is hindered again you are

18
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,030
agitated your growth is inter so the

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,990
best way is to take to meditation when

20
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,509
you take to meditation this turmoil will

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,060
settle down and ready to settle down

22
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,490
your growth will take place after

23
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,810
meditation will feel definitely that you

24
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,939
have come out very well

25
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,850
you have grown wherever but for that

26
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,619
what has to be very honest you cannot

27
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,600
force people to be honest that's one

28
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,450
thing you can't do you have to be honest

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,039
yourself you are not to be hypocrite you

30
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,920
have to see for yourself that whatever

31
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:48,990
you are doing is for your benevolence

32
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,840
it's for your good and that you have to

33
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,539
do it because it is good for you to

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,789
begin and then for the good of the

35
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:59,429
humanity we are doing for the good of

36
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:00,840
the humanity now some people who come

37
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:03,659
for the first time will have lots of

38
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,850
doubts because of ego they have lots of

39
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,300
doubts because of ego how can that be

40
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:13,020
how can this be how I mean all kinds of

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:17,160
things they ask now you have to say that

42
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,830
first of all you develop your inside you

43
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,110
develop your enlightenment your light is

44
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:26,099
not sufficient in the light only there

45
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,460
are no doubts supposing in darkness you

46
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,760
think that

47
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,350
this table has no cover it's alright you

48
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,940
can think whatever you like but when

49
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,590
there's like to see for yourself there

50
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:40,090
is a beautiful cover on top of this

51
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:43,960
table in the same way it happens to us

52
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:47,800
that we have to achieve a state and as

53
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,540
we achieve that state then there's no

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,570
question there's no doubt there's

55
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:55,720
nothing and you become so empowered it

56
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:58,480
is such a simultaneous thing it works as

57
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,960
soon as you achieve something it works

58
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,500
when it works then you are convinced

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:08,500
it's so I'd say it was a very beautiful

60
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:12,550
new chain starts within yourself and

61
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:16,660
then you really starts enjoying your joy

62
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:21,610
of yourself in the most chaotic

63
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:27,970
conditions this world is today so at

64
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:31,300
that time a kind of a silence will come

65
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:34,180
within you when there will be any such

66
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,790
crisis immediately become extremely

67
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:42,430
silent but this is again estate

68
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:47,980
attempted so now if there is something

69
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:53,350
that makes you upset or makes you

70
00:03:47,980 --> 00:04:00,340
unhappy try to reach that point that

71
00:03:53,350 --> 00:04:02,950
axis which is just silence and this

72
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:07,230
silence will make you really powerful

73
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:10,240
because this silence is not only yours

74
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:14,980
when you are in that silence you are in

75
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:20,460
the silence of the cosmos silence of the

76
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,460
cosmos and the silence of the cosmos

77
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,840
works for you you are in connection with

78
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:36,310
that cosmic power we can call it it's

79
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:40,330
more than that is divine power I should

80
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:53,350
say divine power which is working all

81
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:57,099
the cosmos also so if you just become

82
00:04:53,350 --> 00:05:04,960
silent within yourself know that you are

83
00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:07,199
sitting in the kingdom of God is like

84
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,199
this

85
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:24,939
when say you get the great honor of

86
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:31,860
becoming a king then you walk up to your

87
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:41,620
throne and you sit down and look around

88
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:47,699
and you feel the silence of the state

89
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:51,389
that now you are the king this silence

90
00:05:47,699 --> 00:06:01,240
is the sign that you are definitely

91
00:05:51,389 --> 00:06:05,349
definitely you are now in contact with

92
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:09,029
the divine you're silent because the

93
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:09,029
divine is going to look after everything

94
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:16,750
you don't have to do anything just keep

95
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:22,629
silent but not forcibly it's again a

96
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:25,479
state see if any turmoil takes place any

97
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:27,909
problem takes place suddenly your

98
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:34,629
attention will jump on to that silence

99
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:36,729
and once you jump on to that silence you

100
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:39,460
being in contact with this whole

101
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:42,250
all-pervading power and when I talk

102
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:46,930
about all-pervading power we still don't

103
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:49,419
understand what it is what it means this

104
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:53,349
all-pervading power of love is it some

105
00:06:49,419 --> 00:07:00,069
sort of an energy floating around or is

106
00:06:53,349 --> 00:07:03,960
it some sort of a river or some sort of

107
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:03,960
a ether

108
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:18,610
it is the complete the totality of

109
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,610
reality

110
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,870
you
