00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,667
REPORTER: This is Phil Malone for the County Show

2
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,917
at the Victoria Centre in Palk Road in Wellingborough.

3
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,542
With me is Mataji, who teaches Sahaja Yoga.

4
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,375
Now, Mataji, what exactly does this yoga involve?

5
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:42,667
SHRI MATAJI: Sahaja means: “saha” means with, “ja” is born.

6
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,125
So whatever is born with you means spontaneous.

7
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:51,375
It is a living process of the living force, which is surrounding us,

8
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,959
which is everywhere, which pulsates in everything.

9
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,291
And this happening is the breakthrough,

10
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,834
the ultimate breakthrough into our unconscious;

11
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,709
can be described psychologically.

12
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:04,999
REPORTER: So some people call this self-realization.

13
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,250
SHRI MATAJI: Same.

14
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,041
REPORTER: Now, Your background is from a Christian family in India.

15
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,083
Yes.

16
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,542
REPORTER: Is Your teaching involved with Christianity or not?

17
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,333
SHRI MATAJI: It is, of course,

18
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:18,417
because Christ is very important for Sahaja Yoga, no doubt.

19
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,999
But the way we understand Christ

20
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,041
out of the text of Bible is very limited.

21
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,667
We have to see to other texts about Him, and expand,

22
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,000
and explain Him, what He meant,

23
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,583
because Bible is not sufficient to explain Him.

24
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,250
REPORTER: So, is Your message one of peace and that’s, in that case,

25
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,458
peace in the rest of the world or peace within people?

26
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:38,999
SHRI MATAJI: Absolutely.

27
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,792
Peace within will only bring the peace outside.

28
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,667
Whatever we are inside is expressed outside.

29
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,917
REPORTER: Now, You have had some successes

30
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:51,208
in curing people or healing people in the past.

31
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:55,625
Is this because You work from the inside out or how do You do it?

32
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,250
SHRI MATAJI: It’s just very simple because

33
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:02,542
you have the vitality, that Force is vitality itself.

34
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,917
And once you have that flowing through you,

35
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,417
if you give that vitality to someone, that person is revitalized.

36
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,458
In simple words you can say like that.

37
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:14,709
But actually it is a happening within you which takes place.

38
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:17,917
There is a residual force, the germinating force you can call it,

39
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,667
or the ascending force within you,

40
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:25,583
which rises and gives you the experience of your Spirit.

41
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,083
Means your Spirit comes into your attention,

42
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,458
means you can feel it on your central nervous system.

43
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:34,166
So you receive the information

44
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,291
or, we can say, you become enlightened by the Spirit,

45
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,792
which is the Absolute.

46
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:42,333
Once you receive the Absolute, as a by-product of that

47
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,875
all these things drop out, all your maladjustments and everything.

48
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,041
REPORTER: Now, tonight You’re appearing in Northampton

49
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,583
at the Guildhall.  SHRI MATAJI: Yes.

50
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:52,000
REPORTER: If people went along,

51
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,625
what would You have to say to them tonight?

52
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:57,834
SHRI MATAJI: I’ll have to explain to them what actually they are.

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,750
Actually they are the Spirit,

54
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,417
and this body, mind

55
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,458
and all these things are just the covering.

56
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:07,500
Now our attention is at our body level,

57
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,500
at the level of our mind, or emotions.

58
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:14,041
But you have to go beyond, and with this happening it happens.

59
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,125
When it happens, you become the twice-born, as they call it,

60
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:21,208
like an egg becoming a bird the transformation takes place.

61
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,834
REPORTER: So this second birth coming, some people

62
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,333
perhaps they believe this would happen when they die.

63
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,625
SHRI MATAJI: It’s not possible. How can that be?

64
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:32,208
That’s a misunderstanding. There are lots of misunderstandings

65
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,834
we have about these things, which can be removed.

66
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:39,125
First logically we have to reach certain conclusions, logically.

67
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:43,291
So that we don’t put our brain a complete stop,

68
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,667
we see through our logical understanding

69
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:49,125
that what we have to achieve, if it’s a living force.

70
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,291
Then we achieve it.

71
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,625
Once we achieve it, then we have to verify it

72
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:58,000
if it is so or not. It’s all absolutely open.

73
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,458
REPORTER: So, are Your followers then…

74
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,417
how do they practice this form of yoga?

75
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,792
I mean, do they do it in conjunction with other religions, for example?

76
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:08,917
SHRI MATAJI: You see, these religions that you see,

77
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,750
outside they look like different religions

78
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,041
but actually they are one.

79
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:18,667
All these are flowers out of one tree of life.

80
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:21,417
They are different flowers to look at, but they are not.

81
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,917
They are living on the same truth,

82
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,834
there’s no difference at all between them.

83
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,542
But when you pluck them and call them “this is mine, this is mine,”

84
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,625
they become dead, ugly, and funny.

85
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:36,583
That’s how fanaticism has come. All religions are born out of truth

86
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:41,333
and here you find the integration of them, complete integration.

87
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,792
REPORTER: Well, You’ll be meeting with people from Northampton

88
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:46,125
and from the rest of the county in the Guildhall tonight

89
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,417
and thank You very much for speaking with us.

90
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,041
SHRI MATAJI: The address is:

91
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,291
Guildhall, St. Giles’ Square, Northampton.

92
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,083
REPORTER: And it starts at about half past seven.

93
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,959
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, half past seven it will start. I hope to see-

94
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,417
REPORTER: Thank You very much. This is Phil Malone for the County Show

95
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:03,417
at the Victoria Centre, Palk Road, in Wellingborough.

96
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,625
SHRI MATAJI: Was that good? REPORTER: That’s great, that’s fine, yes, thanks very much.

97
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:09,417
...take these flowers with You, all right.

98
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:10,917
SHRI MATAJI: You should have asked about gurus,

99
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,625
I think that’s important. REPORTER: [unclear].

100
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:13,959
SHRI MATAJI: That’s very important, you know,

101
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,875
because all the people are misled by gurus

102
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,750
and all this hypnotic stuff, and black magic.

103
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,792
You must save all these people. That’s very important.

104
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
R: Yes, they get confused, do they?

105
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,917
SHRI MATAJI: Very much confused, you see, the confusion is so much.

106
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,250
That’s the sign of modern times also.

107
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,166
You must know what to expect. REPORTER: Mm, yes. Anyway all the best,

108
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,583
Thanks very much indeed.

109
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:34,959
REPORTER: Thank You, OK, [unclear]. SHRI MATAJI: Thank you very much.

110
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,959
REPORTER: OK, Thank You, [UNCLEAR]. SHRI MATAJI: Sorry I was late,

111
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,750
but yesterday was such a funny experience.

112
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:39,875
We came down

113
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,750
running out forty miles, and nothing happened.

114
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:46,000
Thank you very much, thank you. Good-bye.
