1
00:09:33,202 --> 00:09:48,371
It is such a honor for all of us to pay this
homage to the great poet, printer and a prophet

2
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:50,591
that was William Blake.

3
00:09:50,591 --> 00:10:04,281
When I first came to England, they have been
telling Me that England is a place of scholarship

4
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:15,031
and you can see lots of museums and exhibitions
and suddenly I told the Sahaja yogis that

5
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:22,701
I would like to go and see Tate Gallery for
William Blake's paintings.

6
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:28,851
They were surprised because I seldom go to
any one of them, specially the libraries and

7
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:36,411
the books.

8
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:49,521
And when I went there, I saw this great poet,
this great personality, pouring out His heart

9
00:10:49,521 --> 00:10:57,440
with such concern, with such honesty, with
such understanding and perception of the Divine

10
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:06,801
to the people of England, to understand the
great powers of Divinity.

11
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:17,080
But to My surprise there were some funny people;
they had brought some magnifying glasses and

12
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:23,421
they were looking at the drawings and were
watching the private parts of people.

13
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:32,001
I said, " Look at these wretched, absolutely
baser people, who cannot see the sublime,

14
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:40,380
the highest, which He wanted to paint," and
they were taking photographs.

15
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:50,211
I was surprised the way people reacted and
then I realized how tormented He must have

16
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:58,670
been in His lifetime to live with such people,
who have no sense of Divine.

17
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:05,091
He must have cried in the wilderness; He must
have wept; He could not have been accepted,

18
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,371
it's impossible.

19
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:14,041
Such low level minds cannot accept something
that's sublime and great and My heart bled

20
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,371
with pain.

21
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:16,700
Oh God!

22
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:24,921
Why did He take His birth in a place like
this?

23
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:30,230
To torment Himself, to torture Himself, saying
something which cannot be accepted.

24
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,250
But it's not so.

25
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:44,740
I knew who He was, what He is doing, why He
was here.

26
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:51,100
We do not know about Him much, because from
the books you can't understand who He could

27
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,630
have been.

28
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:58,920
He was an Incarnation., of Bhairavanath.

29
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:09,050
That's whom you call the St. Michael, or St.
George, who is as you know the Saint - Angel

30
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,651
of England.

31
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:23,620
That's why He had to incarnate and for Him,
this was His role, to talk about Divine in

32
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,550
a open, fearless manner.

33
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:35,461
He had to use symbolic language, He had to
use.

34
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:45,111
It's not difficult to understand Him at all;
if you are a realized soul, you'll read through

35
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:52,111
it, sometimes laughing, sometimes weeping,
enjoying the whole drama, what He has tried

36
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:53,111
to explain.

37
00:13:53,111 --> 00:14:04,771
When I read Him I am amazed at His sense of
humor; how He openly comes out with such remarks.

38
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:17,301
I feel He is like Markandeya in India, or
Kabir Dass in India, who slashed the whole

39
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:25,450
society with their sword all the time to see
that they are brought to the proper shape,

40
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,031
without fear.

41
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:40,841
But so gentle, if you read the Song of the
Thel, it's so gentle; and all of them who

42
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:55,681
were Him perhaps or of the same style, extremely
open, straightforward, you can say even blatant

43
00:14:55,681 --> 00:15:01,931
and extremely gentle.

44
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:10,801
The vision of Christ, that He has described,
is the one which He sees through His own enlightened

45
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:23,001
eyes and He sees that the vision is completely
distorted, is the opposite of what Christ

46
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:24,241
was.

47
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:26,801
I also felt the same way.

48
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:33,121
I took My birth in a Protestant, Christian
family and I was shocked the way the Christians

49
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:34,121
were.

50
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:36,690
I said " Are these the Christians?"

51
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:42,581
Now the point He brings forth is very clear
cut, you can understand, that in the mannerism

52
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:48,961
if you are gentle, " I'm sorry" , "I'm afraid"
, " I doubt."

53
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:50,980
Just look at that.

54
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,901
It's very commonly we use this language.

55
00:15:54,901 --> 00:16:00,420
He says that Christ was not a gentleman of
that kind.

56
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:10,070
I also say I'm not seeking election, I'm not
here to please you, but I am here to make

57
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:23,970
you please yourself; to enjoy yourself, to
have your all wealth, enjoyed, manifested.

58
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:31,431
That is how He also put the vision of Christ
before you, that He was not a gentle man,

59
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:40,850
who would go around and be extremely gentle
to people and nice to them, superficially,

60
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:52,961
only the mannerism of it, but He would be
so gentle with the people who are lowly.

61
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:59,111
He created Divinity out of fishermen, who
were ordinary people, uneducated, absolutely

62
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:06,500
we can say, people who were one of the lowest
in the strata of society.

63
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,040
He picked them up and made them Divine.

64
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,151
He didn't go to the ministers and the prime
ministers and the governors.

65
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:21,090
He did not.

66
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:28,991
When you see all the great people who are
supposed to be looking after the religion

67
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:34,590
part of it, they are busy only with governors
and they are only busy with the kings and

68
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,480
the queens; who must go and bow to them.

69
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,600
They are politically activated people.

70
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,461
How can a Divine person get into this mess
of politics which human beings have created?

71
00:17:48,461 --> 00:17:53,070
But we don't understand it, because we try
to rationalize everything and thank God He's

72
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:59,891
the one who talked against rationality; and
against all the intellectual ideas of putting

73
00:17:59,891 --> 00:18:07,171
down Christ to the mere level of a human being,
because He was Himself Divine and He could

74
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:11,441
understand Christ.

75
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:21,221
He was so much pestered and actually persecuted
that He used to get depression sometimes and

76
00:18:21,221 --> 00:18:29,610
He had problems of money, problems of convincing
His brother and sister, everybody trying to

77
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,391
make Him feel uneasy.

78
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:40,490
Such a fine soul came on this earth to talk
of Jerusalem.

79
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:44,141
What did He mean by Jerusalem?

80
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:45,141
What is Jerusalem?

81
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:49,731
We go to Jerusalem for pilgrimage.

82
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:50,731
Why?

83
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:52,661
Because Christ was born there.

84
00:18:52,661 --> 00:18:57,351
England will become Jerusalem when Christ
will be born here.

85
00:18:57,351 --> 00:19:02,911
But how many of English people today care
for the spirit?

86
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:09,341
English language itself is such a funny one,
that we use the word spirit for drinking,

87
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:18,810
the spirit that you call alcohol; spirit for
the dead souls, which hang around, many more

88
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:28,371
here, and spirit for the atma, the spirit.

89
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:35,931
When He came on this earth, the industrial
revolution had not taken its respite.

90
00:19:35,931 --> 00:19:42,571
People were still entering into those 'mills'
as he calls them and He saw the scribes how

91
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:46,601
they were behaving and He saw the whole myth
of religion.

92
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:52,441
He does not know that all the religions were
doing the same nonsense everywhere, not only

93
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,441
Christianity.

94
00:19:53,441 --> 00:20:00,831
You go to any other country and see every
religion is the same style of a nonsense,

95
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:06,771
which is opposite of what the prophets told
them, of what the incarnations told them,

96
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:11,411
of what all the great sages told them.

97
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:19,441
This is not only about Christianity, but still
nobody can forgive it, because Christianity

98
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:26,711
has a special fervor, has a special role,
has a special meaning, that's what He's tried

99
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:35,711
to also say, that Moses came on this earth
to lay down the code of conduct, morality,

100
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:45,170
the moral thing, and also He describes Milton
as a person who describes a Deity who is above

101
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,601
everything, a puritanical Deity.

102
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:54,581
But He describes the Divine humanity.

103
00:20:54,581 --> 00:21:02,120
Also He describes the Christ who came on this
earth for the emancipation of human beings;

104
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,491
not to tell them, "Don't do this and don't
do that."

105
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:09,502
That was all right at the time of Moses in
the beginning of it, the code of it, and He

106
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:17,791
calls it a 'moral' Christianity, meaning 'immoral'
must be, because if you force someone, into

107
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:23,490
something and pass such laws and regulations
at this time, modern times, it's going to

108
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:28,531
be impossible for human beings to follow and
they'll fall into some other traps.

109
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:37,161
Strict rules of anything, imposed on people
who are not realized souls, can push them

110
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:42,870
into some sort of problems, they can become
criminals, they can become violent as a reaction

111
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:50,021
and we see the reaction today acting, that
the hypocrisy of the whole thing is exposed.

112
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:54,461
Like in India or anywhere else, they will
say, "You should not be attached to money,

113
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:59,041
give the money to the church, to the temple,
to the mosque, to all the people to enjoy

114
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,550
it."

115
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:12,430
The kind of life people led in those days
in the name of God, was no model for anyone

116
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:16,001
and that's how poets like Him were born again
and again.

117
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:22,170
I would say that in Lebanon a great poet,
like Kahlil Gibran, was born, and then in

118
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:30,481
India we had so many such poets, who just
lashed the society and lashed all these ideas

119
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:36,480
of the intellectuals, the ideas of the religions,
the ones who were trying to curb them.

120
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,651
Because there was no genuineness, there was
no sincerity.

121
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:47,850
If we are honest people, we really mean it,
then let us face it and see for ourselves

122
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,691
what we have to achieve.

123
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:58,581
So that is how He came as a poet, a remarkable
poet, the way He rhymes it and the sense of

124
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:06,671
humor He has and the way He unfolds the beauty
of words as any poet should do.

125
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:15,531
In Sanskrit it is said, vakyam rasatmakam
kavyam - poetry is full of rasats; rasats

126
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:22,170
means the essences, the explosion of essences
through words.

127
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:29,761
If it could be done, then the magic of it
is called as poetry and that's what you find

128
00:23:29,761 --> 00:23:31,180
in Blake.

129
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:37,641
Such a great poet; poetry is only great when
it talks of the Divine and when it talks of

130
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:40,441
the baser things, takes you to the baser things.

131
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:47,391
The other day I heard one Australian poet
and I was amazed at his bathroom singing,

132
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:54,610
it was horrible; how can you call it a poetry
which sings of baser things of life, which

133
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,691
takes you to the baser things and pleasures?

134
00:23:57,691 --> 00:24:04,001
But He has very clearly, if you can understand
Him, has said, "What are these books for?

135
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:07,921
This is to collect money out of them."

136
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:10,161
Now how do you collect money?

137
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:19,881
By playing on the weaknesses of the people,
pampering their ego, pampering their greed.

138
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:24,990
All these things, if you can do, you can very
nicely befool them and they feel very happy

139
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,860
and nice, that oh what a book it is.

140
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,230
As we have had great writers also in this
country.

141
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:35,800
I would say Shakespeare was a great evolved
soul, but the deterioration you see later

142
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,110
on, like people like Hemingway and all those
coming up.

143
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:43,701
I don't know how, after Somerset Maugham and
all that, suddenly these horrible Hemingway

144
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:47,261
people coming up and people buying their books
like hot cakes.

145
00:24:47,261 --> 00:24:53,781
We've lost all our moorings, we have lost
all our roots, but one thing good has happened

146
00:24:53,781 --> 00:25:03,160
out of this, leading the way of Freud, making
him Christ; all that has led to problems and

147
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:11,920
people now realize, now realize, that's why
the prophecy was there, that's why He was

148
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,920
a Prophet.

149
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,401
He warned people of what is going to happen,
but who is bothered?

150
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:21,050
He was treated as an insane personality.

151
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:28,281
If you go to the lunatic asylum, everybody
will think you are insane, that's the way

152
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:31,560
lunatics look at a sane personality.

153
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,730
His wisdom was condemned.

154
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:42,241
People thought that He is getting all these
hallucinations, He's talking out of His hat,

155
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:48,230
because they have no brains to understand,
they have no enlightenment, they have no perception,

156
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,211
that's why they treated Him that way.

157
00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:56,011
Now He is dead, of course they're selling
His books, making big money; selling His plates,

158
00:25:56,011 --> 00:26:01,050
what He painted, but when He lived, nobody
bothered.

159
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:05,831
And now they can use Him the way they like.

160
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:12,461
I've met some very funny people here, in this
respect, the way they have shown great interest

161
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:17,641
in Blake in saying that, "He says that a naked
woman is the best."

162
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:18,641
I said, "Where?

163
00:26:18,641 --> 00:26:22,191
How could He say such a thing?

164
00:26:22,191 --> 00:26:23,191
He was innocent."

165
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:26,751
Now we do not understand what His is innocence
also.

166
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:33,501
Just like Markandeya describing His mother,
her breast and everything, like a little child.

167
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:41,311
A child doesn't see, sex in a naked body,
he does not see.

168
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:43,971
And the beauty of a woman He describes.

169
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:47,031
That means all women are walking nude, everywhere,
now.

170
00:26:47,031 --> 00:26:53,811
Are you exciting the innocence of people,
or are you exciting the baser self of the

171
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:54,811
people?

172
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:59,451
We have to be natural, are you natural?

173
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:09,011
All these perversions and all these diversifications
has come because man does not have a simple

174
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:11,631
mind, he's a crooked person.

175
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:14,791
This 'crookery' has to go from the mind.

176
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:21,561
That is important; but if I say that , I'm
not doing My job here, I know that.

177
00:27:21,561 --> 00:27:27,451
I know for definite that is not the way it
is going to work out.

178
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:33,181
That's why Christ, the One who said, "Forgive,
forgive them."

179
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:41,731
Otherwise how can God meet man, with this
'crookery', with all this kind of cunning,

180
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:46,041
how can God reach man without forgiveness?

181
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:49,541
He cannot reach man if he listens to Moses,
can He?

182
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:50,831
He cannot.

183
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:58,901
If He has to come to human beings, He has
to forgive and that's what is in Sahaja Yoga

184
00:27:58,901 --> 00:28:00,501
in the beginning.

185
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:06,901
We tell, you must forgive everyone, you forgive
yourself, don't feel guilty.

186
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:12,551
Now in Christianity just the opposite has
been done, let us face it and know for yourself

187
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:15,421
that you have to go and confess to the priest.

188
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:21,561
The priest also gets mad with your confession,
you are already mad.

189
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:24,371
What is there to confess in the ocean of forgiveness?

190
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,601
It just dissolves.

191
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:31,711
What a message Christ gave us that the greatest
weapon we have got is to forgive others and

192
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:39,331
forgive ourselves because God forgives us
and this is the message we have to know, that

193
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:41,321
we have to forgive ourselves.

194
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:48,671
Instead of that, for all that we do wrong,
all that we try to do against our spirit,

195
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:54,171
we feel guilty and moreover if the teachings
are such, that "you better feel guilty", all

196
00:28:54,171 --> 00:28:59,931
the time what we are doing is to feel guilty
and catch on this chakra on the Left Vishuddhi,

197
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:08,081
to such an extent, that in the West wherever
I go I tell them, first of all, you just say

198
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:15,161
one mantra, "Mother, I am not guilty."

199
00:29:15,161 --> 00:29:17,741
Take it out of you, who are you to feel guilty?

200
00:29:17,741 --> 00:29:24,951
When God loves you so much, He has made you
the epitome of evolution, you are at the highest

201
00:29:24,951 --> 00:29:28,253
point, why should you judge yourself and feel
guilty?

202
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:32,461
Is He not capable of forgiving you?

203
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:37,871
Have you no faith in His ocean of love?

204
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:46,051
But this is the basics of the mistakes that
are committed in the name of Christ.

205
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:52,951
I'm telling to the priests, now who is a priest
here, coming from theological college, can

206
00:29:52,951 --> 00:29:56,181
you learn about Divinity in the theological
college?

207
00:29:56,181 --> 00:29:59,781
Did Christ go to any theological college?

208
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:05,641
How did He get it, how did He get the knowledge
- through enlightenment, enlightenment has

209
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:06,641
to be there.

210
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:14,461
The way He has clearly stated everything,
nobody liked it, because of vested interest.

211
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:16,501
Everybody has vested interest.

212
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:21,221
Nobody is sincere, honest, and they want to
exploit others to make money.

213
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:24,341
You cannot make money in the name of God.

214
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:27,001
Is sin.

215
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:29,961
Such people can never enter into the kingdom
of God.

216
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:35,531
That's why Christ has said, "You'll be calling
Me, Christ, Christ, I won't recognize you."

217
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:38,021
That's a fact.

218
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:45,141
So if you have to be a truthful person, just
a truthful person, do not feel guilty about

219
00:30:45,141 --> 00:30:46,141
it.

220
00:30:46,141 --> 00:30:48,611
Do not feel you have committed sin.

221
00:30:48,611 --> 00:30:53,291
There's a little story in India that one missionary
came to a village in India.

222
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:59,931
Indian people are in the villages very simple,
you know, they are not so sophisticated.

223
00:30:59,931 --> 00:31:05,371
So when he was going, they praised him a lot,
"Sir, we are thankful to you that you have

224
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:08,981
told us what is sin and that we are sinners."

225
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:15,041
They didn't know they were sinning.

226
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:23,041
And this is one of the things that Blake brought
forth for us to show that Christ was a person

227
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:26,541
who brought a new message over Moses.

228
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:31,351
Of course Moses was needed at the time when
Jews had to come up, that was the time they

229
00:31:31,351 --> 00:31:36,731
needed it and He brought these shariat laws;
it was Moses who started but Muslims are following

230
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:38,441
them.

231
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:49,001
Now when today we are in this twentieth century,
sitting down here, we have to see what is

232
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:52,821
the prophecy of this great man, William Blake.

233
00:31:52,821 --> 00:31:59,221
Can you imagine, His birthday was in this
month, Guru Nanaka's birthday in this month,

234
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:10,091
Mohammed Sahib's birthday on this month, all
these great people were born on this month.

235
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:17,181
Now, this month also we celebrated the Diwali.

236
00:32:17,181 --> 00:32:28,381
Such a great month is this one and in this
month those who are born have to be great

237
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:32,481
people.

238
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:47,971
In the whole understanding of Blake, I find
a single lonely man, plowing this land with

239
00:32:47,971 --> 00:32:52,741
the seeds of wisdom.

240
00:32:52,741 --> 00:33:02,191
I'm here just to reap it; He's the one who
planted, watered, made ready by Shakespeare,

241
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:09,031
you can say; you have had many great poets
here, Wordsworth another one who really is

242
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:11,681
enchanting and beautiful.

243
00:33:11,681 --> 00:33:18,511
I think Wordsworth must have seen the fate
of William Blake and he said better describe

244
00:33:18,511 --> 00:33:23,811
the nature, forget about human beings; he
must have thought of it, thinking it to be

245
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:29,461
an incorrigible land where He cannot sow anything.

246
00:33:29,461 --> 00:33:47,181
But whatever it is, what Blake has done is
to give you a new vision and a new idea, because

247
00:33:47,181 --> 00:34:02,161
in the West, Christ has been shrunk to a position
of someone who was just a human being and

248
00:34:02,161 --> 00:34:06,911
now, when you hear the way people describe
Him, I'm amazed.

249
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:12,401
From where did they get this vision?

250
00:34:12,401 --> 00:34:15,831
Have they got eyes or are they blind to talk
like this about Him?

251
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:21,151
I hear the bishops talking like that, all
your archbishops talking like that.

252
00:34:21,151 --> 00:34:25,891
Have they no fear of God?

253
00:34:25,891 --> 00:34:29,611
What's going to happen to this country if
you talk about Christ like that?

254
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:37,311
And you are going to have now pictures and
films showing Him to be a unrighteous personality,

255
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:42,001
showing His Mother naked.

256
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:43,361
No respect.

257
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:49,201
Even Blake, I don't know if you have noticed
it, He paints human beings naked all right,

258
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:51,011
but not gods.

259
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:58,281
Christ He never painted, He never paints them
that way, the respect.

260
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:06,141
While we, the great intellectuals of modern
times are trying all these tricks, just to

261
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:09,951
bring forth the wrath of God upon ourselves.

262
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:12,931
The second point about Him was that He was
a printer.

263
00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:15,021
We should think why did He become a printer?

264
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:16,721
Why Blake took to printing?

265
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:25,291
He has described Himself the hell where the
books were created and how He has described,

266
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:30,941
how at every chakra we created a devil and
put them in the libraries.

267
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:35,591
I'm ... that's why against the books very
much, Myself.

268
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,051
But why did He become a printer?

269
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:41,251
It's very important to know and why He wrote
so much about printing.

270
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:45,191
We see the media today.

271
00:35:45,191 --> 00:35:49,291
The media, that's the devil He described.

272
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:55,411
The media is the one has ruined you completely
believe Me - just to make money out of you,

273
00:35:55,411 --> 00:36:01,281
playing upon your weaknesses, making your
children and you weaker and weaker, the society

274
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:06,321
completely being destroyed, systematically.

275
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:13,501
This is the media He wanted to hit, that's
why He took His birth and became a printer.

276
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:15,011
He could have been anything else.

277
00:36:15,011 --> 00:36:19,141
No poet was a printer in England or anywhere
else.

278
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:22,031
It was Blake, who became that.

279
00:36:22,031 --> 00:36:29,771
The reason was He wanted to show that this
media is the one and let Him cut it at its

280
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:30,771
root.

281
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:37,521
But as you know, evil grows, whether you like
it or not and today's media we cannot understand

282
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:48,661
to what extent it has destroyed us, our roots,
our faiths, all our sublime and righteous

283
00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:50,531
visions.

284
00:36:50,531 --> 00:36:59,351
I know that I Myself was asked by your television
people and all that, to come down and talk

285
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:00,351
to them.

286
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:07,611
But amazed at the way the people told Me that
an Anglo Saxon brain, God knows who made that

287
00:37:07,611 --> 00:37:17,771
brain, cannot understand anything that can
be done without money.

288
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:23,911
I said you first get your realization, otherwise
I'm not coming to your programs, or to your

289
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:25,741
televisions.

290
00:37:25,741 --> 00:37:30,591
That's the triumphant pride of Christ you
can see in His crucifixion.

291
00:37:30,591 --> 00:37:35,541
He didn't care, He could have gone fallen
at the feet, you see, as our politicians do,

292
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:38,771
morning 'til evening, moving from one place
to another.

293
00:37:38,771 --> 00:37:42,881
He would have gone to the scribes and the
Pharisees and said, "Oh, please forgive, I

294
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:46,341
will serve you all My life, I'll sell everything."

295
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:48,021
He would not accept that bribe.

296
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:58,441
He went with that triumphant pride on the
cross.

297
00:37:58,441 --> 00:37:59,701
But what does it show?

298
00:37:59,701 --> 00:38:02,391
What does it show?

299
00:38:02,391 --> 00:38:08,124
That we, the stupid, crucified that great
Personality and today are we not again crucifying

300
00:38:08,149 --> 00:38:09,769
Him?

301
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:19,471
That's why I'll say that He was a great Prophet,
because He makes prophecies that, if you do

302
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:28,592
not take to the right path, if you do not
take to the higher seeking, all these things

303
00:38:28,617 --> 00:38:29,617
will show.

304
00:38:29,846 --> 00:38:34,621
Now we have to understand, because it concerns
us.

305
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:39,923
This is what is happening to us, to us, to
our children, to our families, to our society,

306
00:38:39,948 --> 00:38:40,978
to our country.

307
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:53,438
Let us face it and understand that compassion
of God can fail in such horrible, blazing

308
00:38:53,470 --> 00:39:00,216
hearts, which doesn't have any understanding
of the spirit.

309
00:39:00,264 --> 00:39:08,389
Sahaja Yoga came on this earth long time back,
much before I came on this earth, and today

310
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,828
it has come to England.

311
00:39:09,853 --> 00:39:13,769
We should say I came here twelve years back.

312
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:22,229
It took fourteen years for Blake to write
Jerusalem and I think after fourteen years

313
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:29,609
also if I could really feel satisfied that
I've been able to do some justice to Him in

314
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:37,059
this Jerusalem that He wanted to build, I'll
be very much grateful to you all.

315
00:39:37,059 --> 00:39:42,289
But it's not so, it's a very disappointing
thing.

316
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:47,809
People don't want to listen anything, they
want to listen to something that they like,

317
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:53,879
that you have to play on their weaknesses;
all the time tell them that whatever wrong

318
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:58,629
you are doing is a good thing; go ahead with
it.

319
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:05,599
Now the compassion and love of Christ can
work out miracles, no doubt.

320
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,999
It can work out, because He came for us.

321
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:12,989
The whole universe was created for us.

322
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:16,379
It is for us to receive all the blessings
of the Divine.

323
00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:21,159
It is we who are going to become the spirit.

324
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:23,899
As He said, "You are to be born again".

325
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:32,239
But the conditioning, of the subtle conditionings
of these ... surroundings and the atmosphere,

326
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:41,709
the history and all that, is so much embedded
in us, but we don't realize and are not aware,

327
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:48,859
that we have to look upward.

328
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:56,929
Blake's life was another crucifixion, I feel.

329
00:40:56,929 --> 00:41:05,009
When I read Him, tears fall continuously sometimes.

330
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:16,469
What a Son of a great Father, who said Christ
was not bothered about His parents.

331
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:19,529
He ran away from the house at the age of twelve
years.

332
00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:24,509
That means all the boys are now running from
their houses at twelve years taking to drugs;

333
00:41:24,509 --> 00:41:30,349
that's the best way we can pay homage to Him,
by running away from the houses taking to

334
00:41:30,349 --> 00:41:36,429
drugs, because Christ ran away from the house
at the age of twelve years.

335
00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:41,819
And He said, "This is My Father's business,"
that's what He writes, "What do I care for

336
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:43,939
the parents?"

337
00:41:43,939 --> 00:41:49,709
That does not mean that you should not respect
your parents, but it means that, "I am at

338
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:56,669
a higher seeking, I have a higher seeking,
I have to move in another direction.

339
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:03,379
You have lived in this direction, whatever
it is you have balanced your life, but I have

340
00:42:03,379 --> 00:42:05,819
to ascend."

341
00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:11,559
And this is the message He has tried to put
forward before you, very clearly.

342
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:16,374
That is so obvious, so clear cut.

343
00:42:16,565 --> 00:42:23,629
Wherever He's so fiery, wherever He's so compassionate,
wherever He's so gentle, wherever He's so

344
00:42:23,629 --> 00:42:31,750
modest, the inner line is one that, "Achieve
your ascent; achieve your higher being; become

345
00:42:31,775 --> 00:42:32,750
that."

346
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:36,629
He has prepared grounds for us here in England.

347
00:42:36,629 --> 00:42:42,679
As I have told you many a times, England is
a very important part of the universe, which

348
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:45,939
I don't know how many Englishmen realize.

349
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:51,899
It is the heart of the universe; it is small,
but so important.

350
00:42:51,899 --> 00:42:54,589
But what do we get from the heart?

351
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:59,832
What do we have in the heart?

352
00:42:59,932 --> 00:43:01,444
Racialism.

353
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,209
If Christ comes here, you'll throw Him out
because He's not English, or do you believe

354
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:12,258
that He was English?

355
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:19,709
What do we get ? We can't love our children,
we kill our children, we ill-treat them.

356
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:22,838
You are sitting in the heart of the universe.

357
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:31,618
This is the heart of the universe and what
do you have to give to the world?

358
00:43:31,618 --> 00:43:32,618
The spirit.

359
00:43:32,618 --> 00:43:41,409
The spirit resides in your heart and that's
why Blake said that England has to become

360
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:43,866
Jerusalem, because it is the heart.

361
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:53,394
That means Spirit has to come in the attention
of the universe, otherwise things won't work

362
00:43:53,419 --> 00:44:03,159
out, but from where is it going to come, this
Spirit, where is going to be awakened?

363
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:09,258
It is going to be awakened in the human beings,
and where are those human beings - in the

364
00:44:09,258 --> 00:44:11,409
heart?

365
00:44:11,544 --> 00:44:13,083
Where are they living?

366
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:18,238
Even those who have come here, immigrants
and all that, they are gone cases, useless,

367
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,599
good for nothing.

368
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:25,669
And those who are living here are already
lethargic; the heart is lethargic, it cannot

369
00:44:25,669 --> 00:44:28,509
pump anything out of it.

370
00:44:28,509 --> 00:44:35,308
First it was over pumping, tried to impress
the whole world, and now after the impression,

371
00:44:35,308 --> 00:44:39,698
it is in depression.

372
00:44:39,698 --> 00:44:47,339
This heart has to awaken, to make the whole
world a spiritual being.

373
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:50,269
Do we realize our responsibility?

374
00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:57,998
Do we understand this - what is the role we
have to play as a spiritual being?

375
00:44:57,998 --> 00:45:05,008
You have to play a role as a spiritual being
now; but we are not, we are busy with all

376
00:45:05,008 --> 00:45:10,899
other nonsensical things, but with theSpirit.

377
00:45:10,899 --> 00:45:14,569
I have labored for twelve years, as I said,
and I think I'll have to stay here for two

378
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:23,738
years more, fourteen years, and then only
maybe, I hope so, Jerusalem will start showing

379
00:45:23,738 --> 00:45:26,149
its results in this country.

380
00:45:26,149 --> 00:45:31,008
You can do it, you are the only ones who can
do it, nobody else.

381
00:45:31,008 --> 00:45:33,389
You are entitled to that.

382
00:45:33,389 --> 00:45:38,459
God has chosen you to be born here, with a
purpose.

383
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:43,359
But you can't talk to any one about religion,
they don't discuss religion.

384
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,488
But what religion?

385
00:45:46,488 --> 00:45:50,389
Religion which contains all the religions
of the world.

386
00:45:50,389 --> 00:45:57,119
Religion which is the inner balance, the tranquility
within you, which gives you the ascent and

387
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,399
we don't discuss it.

388
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:03,929
This is out of etiquette, we can discuss all
the drunkards and all the pubs of the world,

389
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:09,144
but we cannot discuss such a horrible thing
like religion, which is so innate and within

390
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:10,759
ourselves.

391
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:16,119
You cannot have anything in the newspaper
about it.

392
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:23,339
But, He has described all the fake gurus and
all the satanic people with such a strong

393
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:28,988
description of all these and you see them
and thousands follow these nonsensical people,

394
00:46:28,988 --> 00:46:34,698
pay them money, become beggars, but they don't
want to come to reality.

395
00:46:34,698 --> 00:46:42,829
Why, I ask Myself, why it's happening like
this?

396
00:46:42,829 --> 00:46:47,219
No use going to any excuses.

397
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:54,718
Here is someone who has given you such a lot
of explanation.

398
00:46:54,718 --> 00:46:59,792
Holy Ghost, He says, and Holy Ghost ... a
vacuum.

399
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:07,103
You ask anyone, I was surprised, when it was
asked to some very big bishop, "What do you

400
00:47:07,128 --> 00:47:07,800
think of Holy Ghost?"

401
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:13,197
He says, "I'm agnostic, agnostic."

402
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:17,199
Then ... from India ... asks him, "Then what
are you doing here?"

403
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,219
He said, "I am doing my job, as you are doing
your job."

404
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:22,789
[unknown name and word] it's all quiet.

405
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:27,649
He's agnostic, he doesn't know anything about
Holy Ghost.

406
00:47:27,649 --> 00:47:29,229
What is Holy Ghost?

407
00:47:29,229 --> 00:47:33,788
William Blake has said, "It resides within
you."

408
00:47:33,788 --> 00:47:36,249
Why don't we find out where does it reside?

409
00:47:36,249 --> 00:47:39,058
... Why not we go out of the way to find out?

410
00:47:39,058 --> 00:47:42,458
Bible cannot contain Christ, the whole universe
cannot contain Christ.

411
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:46,238
Let us go out and find out what others have
to say about it.

412
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:51,978
But we are very insular self-opinionated,
great people sitting here in complete lethargy.

413
00:47:51,978 --> 00:47:59,146
We have no time, we don't think anybody to
be considered about it, let us go out and

414
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:00,314
see.

415
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:07,058
What is Holy Ghost is very simple; Holy Ghost
is the Kundalini.

416
00:48:07,058 --> 00:48:10,779
See, you use logic, not rationality but logic,
is different.

417
00:48:10,779 --> 00:48:17,298
If you use your logic, you will see that we
have a Trinity, Holy Trinity.

418
00:48:17,298 --> 00:48:24,929
We have God Almighty, all right, and we have
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

419
00:48:24,929 --> 00:48:30,699
Have you heard of any father having a son
without the mother?

420
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:35,458
Then who is the Holy Ghost is the Primordial
Mother.

421
00:48:35,458 --> 00:48:41,308
Automatically you come to that conclusion,
but Mother should not be mentioned.

422
00:48:41,308 --> 00:48:49,729
That's why Blake has said about the daughters
of Albion, because He knew the way the women

423
00:48:49,729 --> 00:48:51,389
were suppressed in this life.

424
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:53,545
Very sophisticated ways.

425
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:59,788
In Sanskrit it is said, yatra narya pujyante
tatra ramente devata "Where the women are

426
00:48:59,788 --> 00:49:03,433
worshipped, there remains the domain of the
deities."

427
00:49:03,616 --> 00:49:09,528
Where they are worshipped, and they have to
be worshipful, not the harlots, in the brothels

428
00:49:09,528 --> 00:49:19,659
and the women who walk nude and show off their
nudity to excite the baser self, but the ones

429
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:26,569
who are worshipful, where they reside, reside
the gods.

430
00:49:26,569 --> 00:49:31,899
So these women were suppressed and suppressed
to such an extent that they did not want to

431
00:49:31,899 --> 00:49:35,219
talk about God as a Woman, anywhere.

432
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:38,978
So Holy Ghost is something abstract, a dove.

433
00:49:38,978 --> 00:49:44,605
All right, it's a dove, then what.

434
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:47,649
What does it do the dove?

435
00:49:47,649 --> 00:49:51,409
Why is it so important that we should have
blessings from the dove?

436
00:49:51,409 --> 00:49:53,169
Nobody explains, it's a mystery.

437
00:49:53,169 --> 00:49:58,319
We have to live with a mystery; everything
is a mystery, the banking is a mystery here,

438
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,694
the where does the money go is also a mystery.

439
00:50:01,813 --> 00:50:06,198
It has something to do with the mafia, that's
also a mystery, then the Masonic people are

440
00:50:06,198 --> 00:50:10,099
organizing the Switzerland bank is also a
mystery.

441
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:14,518
Everything mysterious and hidden and kept
aside, "Oh, that is not to be said, this is

442
00:50:14,518 --> 00:50:19,718
just 'overseas banking' Oh good, very good
name."

443
00:50:19,718 --> 00:50:25,929
It's 'overseas banking', it is this, it is
that, and we carry on with this hypocrisy,

444
00:50:25,929 --> 00:50:31,119
we carry on with all these false notions,
"Oh that's all right, that's all right, that

445
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,119
part is all right."

446
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:35,349
This is not forgiveness.

447
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:39,379
What is the forgiveness for the cunning?

448
00:50:39,379 --> 00:50:42,689
What is the forgiveness for the crooked?

449
00:50:42,689 --> 00:50:47,899
What is the forgiveness for satan?

450
00:50:47,899 --> 00:50:53,373
Discrimination is needed when we talk of forgiveness.

451
00:50:53,398 --> 00:50:57,238
Forgiveness is for the people who think they
have committed sins.

452
00:50:57,238 --> 00:51:03,698
It's only in thinking you commit sins, otherwise
you do not.

453
00:51:03,698 --> 00:51:09,869
Look at a dog, look at a tiger, look at all
these people, if tiger has to eat the cow,

454
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:11,538
it eats; does it commit any sin?

455
00:51:11,538 --> 00:51:12,859
It does not know about a sin.

456
00:51:12,859 --> 00:51:18,839
"Now I didn't know what is sin is," he will
say that, "I didn't know it was a sin, you

457
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:25,181
see I just ate it, but what is the sin?"

458
00:51:25,546 --> 00:51:32,849
Just to condemn someone all the time, "You
are the sinners, you did this sin, you did

459
00:51:32,849 --> 00:51:34,218
that sin."

460
00:51:34,218 --> 00:51:38,548
Human beings, they are the temple of God.

461
00:51:38,548 --> 00:51:47,399
With what care, with love, affection, delicacy
they are created.

462
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:48,528
For what?

463
00:51:48,528 --> 00:51:56,449
This lotus has been brought out of the mire
of illusion for what?

464
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:57,508
To be condemned?

465
00:51:57,508 --> 00:51:59,919
To be trampled?

466
00:51:59,919 --> 00:52:06,379
To be ill-treated in this way, that too in
the name of God?

467
00:52:06,379 --> 00:52:19,459
Lotuses are created to be offered to the Gods,
with their fragrance, to illuminate the whole

468
00:52:19,459 --> 00:52:20,459
world.

469
00:52:20,459 --> 00:52:26,558
They are the poetic genius of the Lord, as
He has described.

470
00:52:26,558 --> 00:52:40,149
While we look at human beings as something
to be exploited, to be suppressed, to be oppressed

471
00:52:40,149 --> 00:52:46,889
and so, as He says, there are two types of
people, and He has given horrible names to

472
00:52:46,889 --> 00:52:54,839
them, who try to oppress the people, who try
to devour the people and He calls that the

473
00:52:54,839 --> 00:53:00,429
religion now has become the compromise between
the two.

474
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:07,629
While the innocent suffer, while the simple
suffer, while the seekers suffer, while the

475
00:53:07,629 --> 00:53:10,569
good suffer, that's the fact.

476
00:53:10,569 --> 00:53:16,808
Let us all of us join together now and get
our realization.

477
00:53:16,808 --> 00:53:18,379
Become the spirit.

478
00:53:18,379 --> 00:53:23,558
Is the easiest thing to do for you, because
the Holy Ghost, which is the Kundalini, is

479
00:53:23,558 --> 00:53:24,699
within you.

480
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:29,978
In the triangular bone She resides and She
can be awakened.

481
00:53:29,978 --> 00:53:35,988
Now one may say that, "Why didn't He talk
about Kundalini?

482
00:53:35,988 --> 00:53:39,669
Whatever He talked, who listened to him?

483
00:53:39,669 --> 00:53:43,659
Whatever He said, who tried to understand;
till today I don't find many people have understood

484
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:45,469
Him.

485
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:51,319
Whatever He manifested, who bothered to know
about it?

486
00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:55,968
And if He had talked of something more, it
would have been obscure.

487
00:53:55,968 --> 00:54:03,468
But He says, "I don't care for the idiots
for whom My sayings are obscure."

488
00:54:03,468 --> 00:54:04,468
He says clearly.

489
00:54:04,468 --> 00:54:12,359
He has used only thrice the word 'idiot' I
think, many times 'stupid' and so many times

490
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:13,679
'the fools'.

491
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:21,159
Above all that, to Me, all of them are God's
own children.

492
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:23,599
I know how He was angry.

493
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:32,438
I know why He was angry and I also understand
Him that He thought that, before Sahaja Yoga

494
00:54:32,438 --> 00:54:41,139
coming here, let Me scold them, let Me give
them a thump, let Me open them with a big

495
00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:43,438
blow, so they are ready.

496
00:54:43,438 --> 00:54:50,419
But in His criticism, I read, they said He
was not acceptable because He went too far.

497
00:54:50,419 --> 00:54:52,429
Same with Me.

498
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:54,438
People don't accept Me because I go too far.

499
00:54:54,438 --> 00:54:55,719
I must try to please them.

500
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:58,859
Am I seeking your votes that I should try
to please you?

501
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:03,989
I have to tell you the truth, whether you
like it or not.

502
00:55:03,989 --> 00:55:08,569
I want you to accept it because that's what
I am here for.

503
00:55:08,569 --> 00:55:12,268
I'm here for that, that you accept the truth
and get it.

504
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:13,548
I'll do my level best.

505
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:18,489
I can make food for you, I can give you good
food to you, I can give you presents, I can

506
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:21,458
do whatever a Mother can do for Her children.

507
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:29,788
But when it doesn't work out, She has to shout
sometimes.

508
00:55:29,788 --> 00:55:35,609
She has to say things clearly, because you
have to get it.

509
00:55:35,609 --> 00:55:39,899
Now you cannot force it on people, this is
the biggest problem is.

510
00:55:39,899 --> 00:55:46,929
You cannot force Self-realization on to people,
you cannot do it by force.

511
00:55:46,929 --> 00:55:50,778
Say if the ... supposing Russians tell Me
they are very much interested to know about

512
00:55:50,778 --> 00:55:51,778
Sahaja Yoga.

513
00:55:51,778 --> 00:55:52,778
No doubt.

514
00:55:52,778 --> 00:55:59,528
But if they tell Me that, "You come to our
government and give them realization", I cannot,

515
00:55:59,528 --> 00:56:01,619
I cannot do it.

516
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:02,919
You have to be free people.

517
00:56:02,919 --> 00:56:10,988
When you are free, then you are abandoned,
see, the wages of freedom we are paying.

518
00:56:10,988 --> 00:56:15,778
Nobody is free, in New York if you go, I have
to take out all these ornaments, which I am

519
00:56:15,778 --> 00:56:18,288
supposed to wear because of My family.

520
00:56:18,288 --> 00:56:24,829
I have to go there without a purse, I have
to tie up my purse inside here see something,

521
00:56:24,829 --> 00:56:28,429
otherwise they'll rob it.

522
00:56:28,429 --> 00:56:31,129
Nothing is safe.

523
00:56:31,129 --> 00:56:36,829
So this kind of a freedom which leads to violence,
to butchery; actually the way we have butchered

524
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:43,339
our children, butchered our elders, the way
insulted every one of them, all that goes

525
00:56:43,339 --> 00:56:45,069
hand in hand with freedom.

526
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:51,349
This is no freedom, this is absolutely unleashed
abandonment of the brutal self within us.

527
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:59,699
So whether you go to Russia or to here Sahaja
Yoga is in a problem, whether you go to the

528
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:09,159
left or to the right, I just don't understand,
where will it prosper, where freedom is used

529
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:12,718
with wisdom, with respect.

530
00:57:12,718 --> 00:57:19,788
If you cannot respect the freedom of others
you do not have the freedom at all, you have

531
00:57:19,788 --> 00:57:23,629
never known the freedom, you have never enjoyed
the freedom.

532
00:57:23,629 --> 00:57:32,968
So the freedom of human beings has to be respected
and when this freedom is respected, then only

533
00:57:32,968 --> 00:57:40,069
you can get your realization and then only
you can enter into higher freedom, into complete

534
00:57:40,069 --> 00:57:44,669
liberty that Blake has described.

535
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:54,548
There are seekers, so many seekers in this
country, and so many are lost, so many are

536
00:57:54,548 --> 00:57:55,859
lost.

537
00:57:55,859 --> 00:58:03,659
There have been people who are saved by Sahaja
Yoga, who have been taking drugs, overnight

538
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:05,359
they gave up, overnight.

539
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:06,359
How?

540
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:12,169
It's a mechanism within you, God has built
that, that power of the spirit when it enlightens

541
00:58:12,169 --> 00:58:15,339
you, you just become so powerful, you give
up.

542
00:58:15,339 --> 00:58:19,708
But beforehand if I say, "Don't have this
and don't have that", you cannot do it.

543
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:23,438
You do not have that power of the spirit.

544
00:58:23,438 --> 00:58:29,489
Most of the incarnations who came before Christ
didn't realize this point, that human beings

545
00:58:29,489 --> 00:58:33,508
are not enlightened, they don't have the power
of the spirit within them.

546
00:58:33,508 --> 00:58:37,758
Christ realized it and He said it openly,
"You are to be born again."

547
00:58:37,758 --> 00:58:44,548
Not only that, but He said, "First of all
forgive, talk of forgiveness."

548
00:58:44,548 --> 00:58:50,329
So that they settle down, that they are not
paranoid, that they are not upset.

549
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:56,639
Let them be settled down in peace and in compassion
and then awaken their kundalini and then give

550
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,718
them realization.

551
00:58:57,718 --> 00:59:02,819
So then you have the power, then there is
no temptation, nothing like that.

552
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:05,449
Will you tempt Christ with anything?

553
00:59:05,449 --> 00:59:06,708
You cannot.

554
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:10,909
In the same way you do not get enslaved to
any temptations.

555
00:59:10,909 --> 00:59:17,139
You rise in your own beauty and glory, and
your own strength and power.

556
00:59:17,139 --> 00:59:21,258
You don't have to get subdued to anything.

557
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:24,958
This is what is Self-realization.

558
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:29,169
Sahaja Yoga came to London about twelve years
back when I came.

559
00:59:29,169 --> 00:59:33,109
Now I am not an immigrant for your information,
at all.

560
00:59:33,109 --> 00:59:40,349
I just came by chance, I should say, or by
God's ordained programming.

561
00:59:40,349 --> 00:59:46,349
My husband got elected to this job out of
hundred and thirty-four nations, you see.

562
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:51,278
He was elected , we came here, just because
he was elected, not even appointed, but elected,

563
00:59:51,278 --> 00:59:53,028
and elected four times unanimously.

564
00:59:53,028 --> 00:59:56,989
He is the senior most senior secretary-general.

565
00:59:56,989 --> 01:00:04,448
So we had to come here, and that's how I'm
here, otherwise I may not have ever come to

566
01:00:04,448 --> 01:00:08,579
England to teach Sahaja Yoga.

567
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:18,308
With Blake, One feels compelled to try and
try and try to establish Jerusalem, whatever

568
01:00:18,308 --> 01:00:27,349
may be the case, whatever may be the disappointment,
whatever may be the disgust, doesn't matter.

569
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:29,909
One has to do it.

570
01:00:29,909 --> 01:00:37,709
He had such faith in the England's soil that
we have to build the Jerusalem.

571
01:00:37,709 --> 01:00:46,548
But first, everyone of you who are here must
get your realization and humble down before

572
01:00:46,548 --> 01:00:47,548
your realization.

573
01:00:47,548 --> 01:00:51,319
You are not to be arrogant with it.

574
01:00:51,319 --> 01:00:58,663
He said Christ was not humble before human
beings, but before God He was.

575
01:00:58,663 --> 01:00:59,939
Before His Father He was.

576
01:00:59,939 --> 01:01:06,458
In the same way, you have to be humble before
your spirit and before your Self-realization

577
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:12,988
and you have to get to the higher state.

578
01:01:12,988 --> 01:01:16,949
It's surprising that in India, we had all
this knowledge all these years, but we were

579
01:01:16,949 --> 01:01:20,478
supposed to be heathens, I don't know what
else they called us.

580
01:01:20,478 --> 01:01:22,978
We were supposed to be slaves.

581
01:01:22,978 --> 01:01:28,079
Nobody wanted to know anything about it, the
knowledge of the roots existed and our intellectuals

582
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:33,399
also never bothered, they always followed
Oxford and Cambridge traditions.

583
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:42,718
With this Oxbridge business, we never got
through people to tell them about this great

584
01:01:42,718 --> 01:01:46,819
knowledge we had in that country and everything
subsided.

585
01:01:46,819 --> 01:01:51,599
This knowledge is not meant for India, is
not meant for any particular place, is meant

586
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:56,619
for the whole world, as your knowledge of
science, all the knowledge of the tree is

587
01:01:56,619 --> 01:02:00,698
meant for the whole world, which you gave
it to us, or to give it to all the eastern

588
01:02:00,698 --> 01:02:02,469
countries and people accept it.

589
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:08,359
What's the harm in accepting the knowledge
which comes to you for your benevolence; only

590
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:14,379
because it is from the eastern side you feel
so insecure about it?

591
01:02:14,379 --> 01:02:17,879
From where did Christ come?

592
01:02:17,879 --> 01:02:20,678
He came from America?

593
01:02:20,678 --> 01:02:23,268
I think He must have run away.

594
01:02:23,268 --> 01:02:34,879
Despite that I must say among all of them,
British are the most matured.

595
01:02:34,879 --> 01:02:40,459
But we run after Americans, we run after French,
we run after everyone, not being aware of

596
01:02:40,459 --> 01:02:46,808
ourselves, what we are, we are wisdom.

597
01:02:46,808 --> 01:02:56,278
We are the people who represent the heart
of the universe and time has taken, from Him

598
01:02:56,278 --> 01:02:58,599
to this time, that we have matured now.

599
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:06,729
I hope we have matured enough to understand
that there has to be a breakthrough.

600
01:03:06,729 --> 01:03:14,819
When they published My handbills, you see,
somehow it so happened that My face has come

601
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:16,079
out quite black in that.

602
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:22,739
I said, "Forget it, nobody will come to our
program, if you show such a black face they'll

603
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:29,758
say, 'oh, somebody coming from Africa is trying
to teach us what is Jerusalem'."

604
01:03:29,758 --> 01:03:34,058
So they had to re-do it, to show that I am
not that black.

605
01:03:34,058 --> 01:03:43,409
What difference does it make, the skin deep
color?

606
01:03:43,409 --> 01:03:51,028
The color comes from the heart, the beauty
comes from the heart, the exuberance of the

607
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:59,579
heart expresses that beauty on your being
and the beauty of the truth is that, that

608
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:02,119
it acts, it works.

609
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:07,448
It just doesn't decorate itself, it doesn't
try to take to ways and methods of luring

610
01:04:07,448 --> 01:04:12,899
people but it acts, whether you like it or
not it acts.

611
01:04:12,899 --> 01:04:16,458
Let us work it out.

612
01:04:16,458 --> 01:04:18,579
Is simple.

613
01:04:18,579 --> 01:04:26,409
Instead of going into intellectual feats and
going into the direction of finite understanding

614
01:04:26,409 --> 01:04:32,958
through your brains, let us go to the infinite;
that's only possible when you get to your

615
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:37,198
spirit, which is infinite, which creates the
collective consciousness within.

616
01:04:37,198 --> 01:04:43,298
Which creates, I say, which means knowledge,
but knowledge does not mean what you know

617
01:04:43,298 --> 01:04:48,968
through your brain, but what you know through
your central nervous system; that you can

618
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:53,958
feel it, that you can feel the chakras of
everyone on your fingertips.

619
01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:58,879
Mohammed Sahib has said, "At the time of resurrection
your hands will speak".

620
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:04,268
But look at the Muslims, they never, never
talk of the resurrection, when most of Koran

621
01:05:04,268 --> 01:05:05,659
is nothing but resurrection.

622
01:05:05,659 --> 01:05:09,248
They talk of the doomsday because they have
to make money by frightening people.

623
01:05:09,248 --> 01:05:13,728
Beware of the doomsday, you give the money,
we'll save you, we'll give a certificate;

624
01:05:13,728 --> 01:05:16,558
at the doomsday you stand with the certificate,
you'll be saved.

625
01:05:16,558 --> 01:05:19,458
First they will go down in the doomsday.

626
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:33,978
This is for every religion, people have used
it for very baser things, making money, creating

627
01:05:33,978 --> 01:05:37,149
political ideas.

628
01:05:37,149 --> 01:05:46,058
I can't understand how can diamonds be thrown
into dirt like this, and covered with that,

629
01:05:46,058 --> 01:05:49,758
and the fragrance turned into filth.

630
01:05:49,758 --> 01:05:52,518
It is beyond Me.

631
01:05:52,518 --> 01:05:59,079
The powers of human beings sometimes supercede
that of God, you can see the way they can

632
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:04,659
change the forms, they change the beauty,
change everything that is reality, into something

633
01:06:04,659 --> 01:06:06,798
nonsensical and stupid.

634
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:11,558
And they live with it, they don't want to
know about it; they enjoy it.

635
01:06:11,558 --> 01:06:15,119
"We are very happy people, what's wrong."

636
01:06:15,144 --> 01:06:19,425
What a waste, one feels, of this creation.

637
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:29,439
One feels with what aspirations and visions
these human beings were created on this earth.

638
01:06:29,439 --> 01:06:39,509
And then what should we do to make them understand
what they are, to make them aware with that

639
01:06:39,509 --> 01:06:45,949
perception, with that vision of the Divine
that they are?

640
01:06:45,998 --> 01:06:55,008
Sometimes, I also cry in the wilderness and
share some of the pathos of all these poets

641
01:06:55,008 --> 01:07:03,359
who came on this earth and suffered, and suffered,
and suffered.

642
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:11,478
I hope today, with all this anguish, whatever
I am telling you, you will try to see that

643
01:07:11,478 --> 01:07:15,859
sincerity is the only way you can understand
yourself.

644
01:07:15,859 --> 01:07:24,069
No books , nothing, no conditioning, no denial,
nothing can convince you but the sincerity

645
01:07:24,069 --> 01:07:33,728
to know the spirit, which is within you and
this sincerity I call it as the pure desire.

646
01:07:33,728 --> 01:07:39,728
If you have that pure desire, which is the
power of your kundalini, you will get your

647
01:07:39,728 --> 01:07:41,068
realization.

648
01:07:41,093 --> 01:07:44,537
Now, just now, the shoot.

649
01:07:45,092 --> 01:07:50,558
That's all is needed, the pure desire to be
the Spirit, nothing more than that.

650
01:07:50,558 --> 01:07:58,649
But when it is awakened, then it is to be
looked after, that's very important; it has

651
01:07:58,649 --> 01:08:06,798
to be looked after, it has to be kept burning,
it has to be maneuvered and kept at a point

652
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:10,538
that you start growing more and more.

653
01:08:10,538 --> 01:08:15,188
I need not tell you all about Sahaja Yoga,
it's going to be too much for you, but how

654
01:08:15,188 --> 01:08:19,359
Blake has worked for us.

655
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:28,129
So many poets have done this job and now the
new great poets are coming to finish us off,

656
01:08:28,129 --> 01:08:41,808
to please the media, to make money, befool
us, using flowery words, pleasing sentences,

657
01:08:41,808 --> 01:08:45,064
taking us to hell directly.

658
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:50,899
Beware of them, beware, save your children
from them, save the whole community.

659
01:08:50,899 --> 01:08:56,680
The whole of England has to be saved because
if the heart dies, the whole universe will

660
01:08:56,705 --> 01:08:58,006
die.

661
01:08:58,839 --> 01:09:05,538
May God bless you.

662
01:09:27,849 --> 01:09:43,704
The Sahaja yogis didn't want Me to allow you
to ask Me questions but I think better ask

663
01:09:43,737 --> 01:09:45,177
Me some questions.

664
01:09:45,177 --> 01:09:48,276
Q.....about the chakras....

665
01:09:48,276 --> 01:09:52,417
Shri Mataji: Yes sir.

666
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:57,286
That's what I said, that I didn't talk about
them because it would be too long a lecture

667
01:09:57,286 --> 01:10:04,068
but we have got a book on this, a little book
and there it is all written though I say that

668
01:10:04,068 --> 01:10:11,306
before realization don't even read that book,
can create problems.

669
01:10:11,306 --> 01:10:18,213
You can know all about the subtle side, the
chakras and everything without paying anything,

670
01:10:18,242 --> 01:10:19,732
without any effort.

671
01:10:20,348 --> 01:10:25,887
There are people now in England, you will
be surprised, so many of them are excellent

672
01:10:25,887 --> 01:10:30,717
Sahaja yogis who are experts and they will
tell you all about it very clearly.

673
01:10:30,717 --> 01:10:32,556
We have got books to explain.

674
01:10:32,556 --> 01:10:34,976
As you see there are seven chakras are shown
here.

675
01:10:34,976 --> 01:10:40,870
The lowermost is the Mooladhara Chakra, is
the innocence.

676
01:10:41,497 --> 01:10:46,627
Q:...can you see it with your eyes, outside
the body, can you see it?

677
01:10:46,627 --> 01:10:52,476
Shri Mataji: If you see something then you
are not that.

678
01:10:52,476 --> 01:10:57,506
And people have seen it because they were
not that, because they moved on the sides,

679
01:10:57,506 --> 01:11:01,197
on the sympathetic nervous system, what we
call the Ida and Pingala.

680
01:11:01,197 --> 01:11:05,687
When you go on sympathetic nervous system
you can see it from outside.

681
01:11:05,687 --> 01:11:10,267
Like this building you can see it from outside,
but when you are in it you don't see it, you

682
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:11,776
see only the inside.

683
01:11:11,776 --> 01:11:18,076
So that's what it is, when you ascend, you
need not see anything, you become, you get

684
01:11:18,076 --> 01:11:23,467
the powers.

685
01:11:23,467 --> 01:11:29,596
People have seen it no doubt, but that one
should not ask for.

686
01:11:29,596 --> 01:11:40,796
I can see the glass - better to drink the
water.

687
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,006
Now what else?

688
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:51,716
Q:....what do You do with all Your wealth,
all your money?

689
01:11:51,716 --> 01:11:54,616
Shri Mataji: My money?

690
01:11:54,616 --> 01:12:01,627
Are you from the bank?

691
01:12:01,627 --> 01:12:06,957
What I do with My money - what do you want
Me to do?

692
01:12:06,957 --> 01:12:09,076
What sort of a question is this?

693
01:12:09,076 --> 01:12:17,167
Ask a simple straightforward question madam
I don't understand what do I do with My money,

694
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:19,197
I don't do anything with it.

695
01:12:19,197 --> 01:12:24,407
Actually My husband manages his money, I ask
him whatever I like.

696
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:28,207
Of course he earns a lot no doubt, he earns
very much.

697
01:12:28,207 --> 01:12:32,316
I sometimes tell him, "I'm ashamed the way
they give you money," because he doesn't even

698
01:12:32,316 --> 01:12:33,816
pay any tax you know.

699
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:38,207
Of course I do spend some money on Sahaja
Yoga, I must confess I have to sometimes,

700
01:12:38,207 --> 01:12:39,276
what to do?

701
01:12:39,276 --> 01:12:47,336
One has to and these people have their own
ashrams, where they stay, and look after it.

702
01:12:47,336 --> 01:12:50,937
For this hall they must have collected some
money I don't know, I don't know what do they

703
01:12:50,937 --> 01:12:53,957
do with their money, I don't know, I have
no idea, I've never seen that.

704
01:12:53,957 --> 01:12:56,846
They are honest people, they all know all
about it.

705
01:12:56,846 --> 01:13:02,596
I don't know anything, I have nothing to do
with it.

706
01:13:02,596 --> 01:13:09,086
This is the aggressiveness, "What do I do
with My money" Just look at this.

707
01:13:09,086 --> 01:13:11,147
Yes sir?

708
01:13:11,147 --> 01:13:25,296
Q....a man has mental illness, he wants to
know whether he'll have it after he dies....

709
01:13:39,434 --> 01:13:45,577
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, just now you can
cure it.

710
01:13:45,602 --> 01:13:47,441
Why to think of death?

711
01:13:47,466 --> 01:13:53,479
You can be cured of your mental illness at
least, minimum, that could be done.

712
01:13:53,504 --> 01:14:04,036
Q....How can you tell that it's Self-realization?

713
01:14:04,036 --> 01:14:06,296
You feel a breeze but how does it become...

714
01:14:20,452 --> 01:14:24,692
Shri Mataji: You see, when you feel the cool
breeze is the beginning of it, all right?

715
01:14:24,717 --> 01:14:28,382
Now you have to see what this cool breeze
is, all right?

716
01:14:28,407 --> 01:14:34,407
Now if you go to a college of science or a
college of medicine what you have to do is

717
01:14:34,432 --> 01:14:41,893
to see what it is, isn't it; and to see whatever
it says does it prove.

718
01:14:41,893 --> 01:14:49,412
Now, when you see the cool breeze in your
hand, what happens that it is, as I said,

719
01:14:49,412 --> 01:14:53,976
is the compassion of God say for example,
you just believe in the hypothesis just now.

720
01:14:54,001 --> 01:14:58,567
Now what is this compassion doing, is made
you a computer.

721
01:14:58,592 --> 01:15:05,052
On the fingertips you can tell what centers
are catching, of yours and of others, so you

722
01:15:05,077 --> 01:15:07,306
become the diagnosis.

723
01:15:07,331 --> 01:15:14,982
Now if you know a little few gestures by which
you can handle this power, you can cure them.

724
01:15:15,007 --> 01:15:17,513
That's the minimum, all right?

725
01:15:17,538 --> 01:15:22,169
You can know from this whether you have mental
problem or you have emotional problem, or

726
01:15:22,194 --> 01:15:25,623
you have physical problem and of what nature.

727
01:15:26,071 --> 01:15:30,605
This is how is the self-knowledge starts,
from the very basics.

728
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:35,229
What's your problem with you, first let us
see the problem on the centers, all right?

729
01:15:35,254 --> 01:15:40,405
Then you move forward when you go with it,
then you understand what's the problem with

730
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:45,559
others; then what's the problem in the collective;
then what's the problem of this country; and

731
01:15:45,736 --> 01:15:52,766
if you know how to solve them, sitting down
here, you can do it, you can solve it.

732
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:57,872
But this is the breeze which has to be felt
first because this is the breeze which we

733
01:15:57,897 --> 01:16:01,806
call as the all-pervading power of God.

734
01:16:01,882 --> 01:16:07,943
Now, just because I say you should not believe
Me, because blind faith is of no use, but

735
01:16:07,943 --> 01:16:11,483
you can experiment and see for yourself.

736
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:13,283
Even little children know.

737
01:16:13,283 --> 01:16:16,862
They can tell you what is catching in you,
what chakras are catching.

738
01:16:16,862 --> 01:16:22,243
You can have ten children, 'fold' their eyes,
put them before a gentleman, immediately they'll

739
01:16:22,243 --> 01:16:24,683
raise this finger or this finger.

740
01:16:24,683 --> 01:16:29,592
Supposing they raise this finger, means this
person feels terribly guilty.

741
01:16:29,592 --> 01:16:34,703
He must be a Catholic that he feels so guilty.

742
01:16:34,703 --> 01:16:38,843
That the children won't say but you will know
that this is the chakra is caught up here

743
01:16:38,843 --> 01:16:41,933
because he's feeling guilty.

744
01:16:41,933 --> 01:16:47,922
Like that you can go on finding on your own
being like a laboratory the whole thing becomes

745
01:16:47,922 --> 01:16:55,003
like a computer because it is knowledge, knowledge
through your central nervous system, through

746
01:16:55,003 --> 01:16:57,922
your evolutionary process.

747
01:16:57,922 --> 01:17:02,142
But you have to practice and understand what
it is.

748
01:17:02,142 --> 01:17:07,062
If I give you a car, how will you know it
moves unless and until you get into it and

749
01:17:07,062 --> 01:17:09,783
know how to drive it, isn't it.

750
01:17:09,783 --> 01:17:17,062
You have to give some time, not much, but
you enjoy, best part of it you enjoy doing

751
01:17:17,062 --> 01:17:18,062
the whole thing.

752
01:17:18,062 --> 01:17:25,092
It just flows automatically, you don't have
to do anything about it.

753
01:17:25,092 --> 01:17:31,943
But one has to learn, little bit, what it
is.

754
01:17:31,943 --> 01:17:38,533
Before realization you don't have to do anything,
it just forms spontaneously as the seed is

755
01:17:38,533 --> 01:17:40,683
sown in the Mother Earth, all right?

756
01:17:40,683 --> 01:17:45,772
Then when it comes out, then you have to look
after it; the same way you have to look after

757
01:17:45,772 --> 01:17:47,802
your realization, respect it.

758
01:17:47,802 --> 01:17:49,642
Then you become the masters.

759
01:17:49,642 --> 01:17:55,152
We have one master standing here and we have
so many.

760
01:17:55,152 --> 01:18:04,415
They are just like you to look at, but they
know so much and they are so humble.

761
01:18:04,415 --> 01:18:09,852
They don't go about with a big plate on their
heads "I am the master of this and master

762
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:10,852
of that" nothing.

763
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:16,713
They are doing all their jobs, they are doing
very well, they are blessed and also they

764
01:18:16,713 --> 01:18:21,253
are helping people to get their realization.

765
01:18:21,253 --> 01:18:26,373
You'll be surprised in Sahaja Yoga very difficult
to get an unemployed person.

766
01:18:26,373 --> 01:18:28,083
All of them are employed.

767
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:32,073
If they are unemployed they get employment
with God also.

768
01:18:34,653 --> 01:18:37,043
Basically they are employed by God.

769
01:18:38,035 --> 01:18:39,035
All right?

770
01:18:39,567 --> 01:18:47,210
Q... is this the only way to get realization?

771
01:18:47,235 --> 01:18:51,221
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course; there cannot
be another, God could not make thousand and

772
01:18:51,246 --> 01:18:52,945
one, could He?

773
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:58,211
That would be too much of a headache , like
as you sprout the seed, how do you do it?

774
01:18:58,236 --> 01:18:59,236
Spontaneously.

775
01:18:59,261 --> 01:19:04,531
Sahaja Yoga means spontaneous, living process
is always spontaneous.

776
01:19:04,715 --> 01:19:09,945
Now supposing we want to sprout a seed and
we take out the primule, push it out and push

777
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:13,430
it inside the Mother Earth, will it sprout
- no.

778
01:19:13,455 --> 01:19:17,886
You have to take advantage of the powers of
the Mother Earth, to sprout a seed, isn't

779
01:19:17,911 --> 01:19:20,091
it?

780
01:19:25,723 --> 01:19:36,252
Q. ...saying she has not come across Sahaja
Yoga in the religions, that there are many

781
01:19:36,277 --> 01:19:36,874
religions.

782
01:19:37,181 --> 01:19:40,508
Shri Mataji: In the religions there's no ... religions
are no religions, that's the trouble is.

783
01:19:40,545 --> 01:19:44,965
I have told you all this just now that there
is nothing, they will never mention that is

784
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:46,630
sensible, but it's not so.

785
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:52,437
I would say Sikhism, we can say is the latest
religion.

786
01:19:52,437 --> 01:19:59,417
I mean there are so many verses about, much
later than Islam, Sikhism came on this earth

787
01:19:59,417 --> 01:20:04,417
and they have said that, complete description,
I mean you don't understand Hindi otherwise

788
01:20:04,417 --> 01:20:09,497
I would have told you - Ida, Pingala, Sushumna
- everything they have described - Kabira

789
01:20:09,497 --> 01:20:15,467
has described at such length that we have
in India a great poet Gyaneshwara and He has

790
01:20:15,467 --> 01:20:17,487
described all about kundalini.

791
01:20:17,487 --> 01:20:21,107
If you go in Maharashtra and tell them that
somebody is going to awaken the kundalini,

792
01:20:21,107 --> 01:20:26,647
they'll all rush, they know all about it.

793
01:20:26,647 --> 01:20:29,107
How many years did Christ live?

794
01:20:29,107 --> 01:20:33,997
How many times He could talk to people?

795
01:20:33,997 --> 01:20:38,997
How many of them accepted Him and how many
of them understood Him?

796
01:20:38,997 --> 01:20:49,212
He went to a wrong place, I tell you; all
were deaf, dumb and brainless.

797
01:20:49,848 --> 01:20:52,878
How will they understand?

798
01:20:52,903 --> 01:20:57,513
How could He talk about Kundalini when everybody
was after His life?

799
01:20:57,513 --> 01:21:02,741
But He did talk of Holy Ghost, He talked of
the Comforter He was going to send.

800
01:21:02,766 --> 01:21:05,806
He talked of so many things in that short
time.

801
01:21:05,831 --> 01:21:11,871
Do you know for four years I was struggling
with seven hippies in London; for four years.

802
01:21:11,896 --> 01:21:19,196
I must say, it's very creditable for Him in
three and a half years to talk so much.

803
01:21:19,221 --> 01:21:23,591
How many years Blake had to work hard to talk
to you?

804
01:21:23,616 --> 01:21:25,856
Is it easy to talk to people about truth?

805
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:30,951
Very difficult; everybody is extremely intelligent
and wise, nobody want to listen to anything,

806
01:21:30,976 --> 01:21:31,976
do they?

807
01:21:32,829 --> 01:21:38,930
But in India we have a tradition; we know
it; that you have to ascend.

808
01:21:38,955 --> 01:21:41,197
The whole thing works out that way.

809
01:21:41,222 --> 01:21:46,162
If they talk of kundalini, not in the North
so much, but in Maharashtra, if you go, if

810
01:21:46,187 --> 01:21:49,551
you go in the South, you'll be amazed six
thousand people, seven thousand people come

811
01:21:49,576 --> 01:21:50,576
in a village.

812
01:21:50,601 --> 01:21:54,231
They have seen it, these people have seen
it, they come in bullock carts, they come

813
01:21:54,256 --> 01:22:03,066
in, any way that is possible for them, buses,
and trains, and they walk miles together when

814
01:22:03,091 --> 01:22:05,721
they hear I'm there.

815
01:22:05,746 --> 01:22:12,812
Once I was coming from a program in the night
and suddenly I found lots of people lying

816
01:22:12,837 --> 01:22:13,837
on the road.

817
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,684
I said, "Who are these people?"

818
01:22:15,709 --> 01:22:18,278
They said, "Mother we couldn't reach Your
program, we were late, You give us realization

819
01:22:18,303 --> 01:22:19,770
here."

820
01:22:19,795 --> 01:22:20,770
I said: "All right, have it."

821
01:22:21,522 --> 01:22:26,726
They had it, they are the ones who'll get
much faster than anyone else, I know, that's

822
01:22:26,751 --> 01:22:28,921
why I don't mind spending some time here.

823
01:22:28,946 --> 01:22:34,366
Once I go there, you will see the whole country
would be ablaze, I'm not telling you lies,

824
01:22:34,391 --> 01:22:36,314
you ask the people who have been there.

825
01:22:36,339 --> 01:22:41,439
They are very different type of people, to
them most important is their spirit.

826
01:22:41,464 --> 01:22:48,944
If you tell them what, the way we talk about
Christ here, so disrespectfully, without understanding,

827
01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:50,678
they are shocked.

828
01:22:50,737 --> 01:22:56,316
Any Indian who is a Christian or a Muslim
or a Hindu, doesn't treat the way you treat

829
01:22:56,341 --> 01:22:57,341
Bible.

830
01:22:58,855 --> 01:23:02,959
The respect they have has come to them traditionally.

831
01:23:03,134 --> 01:23:06,224
Of course you don't judge Indians by the Indians
who have come here.

832
01:23:06,224 --> 01:23:13,034
They like your company, they are this type,
they are materialistic, they want to have

833
01:23:13,034 --> 01:23:20,824
money, they have come here to earn money,
but the people who are in India in the villages,

834
01:23:20,824 --> 01:23:29,064
not in the cities, are still seeking, seeking
God, they're very simple people, humble people.

835
01:23:29,064 --> 01:23:31,514
Traditionally we have known for thousands
of years.

836
01:23:31,514 --> 01:23:40,265
I talk of Markandeya who was there twelve
thousand years back, who incarnated here as

837
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:42,075
William Blake.

838
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:47,314
Twelve thousand years back He said the same
thing which is said in England after twelve

839
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:51,042
thousand years, because that time I don't
know what was here, may be only jungles, I

840
01:23:51,067 --> 01:23:52,217
think.

841
01:23:54,684 --> 01:24:01,944
And that is also waste, isn't it, tell Me,
isn't it?

842
01:24:01,944 --> 01:24:04,584
How much could Christ talk about kundalini?

843
01:24:04,584 --> 01:24:07,734
He talked of Holy Ghost.

844
01:24:07,734 --> 01:24:14,237
But why stick on to that, now I have come
to talk to you.

845
01:24:14,237 --> 01:24:19,645
Better take your realization; when He came,
they talked of Moses, when Moses came they

846
01:24:19,645 --> 01:24:20,645
talked of Abraham.

847
01:24:20,645 --> 01:24:29,574
What about the present, I am with you, why
not have your realization?

848
01:24:29,574 --> 01:24:34,814
All religions were built for this day, that
you get your realization, to give you the

849
01:24:34,814 --> 01:24:40,704
balance, to give you that property by which
you ascend.

850
01:24:40,704 --> 01:24:45,064
Like when we have an aeroplane, we fix it
up properly; in the same way they wanted to

851
01:24:45,064 --> 01:24:51,574
fix you up, but the religions went astray,
they made people crooked, the things they

852
01:24:51,574 --> 01:24:56,274
fixed, wrong bolts into wrong places, the
whole aeroplane is in a tattered condition

853
01:24:56,274 --> 01:24:59,574
if it flies, it will all fall down.

854
01:24:59,574 --> 01:25:03,124
Better give up all those ideas.

855
01:25:03,124 --> 01:25:10,284
But kundalini is such a great force, it's
such a great force; it comforts you, it cures

856
01:25:10,284 --> 01:25:16,874
you, it builds up all your centers and slowly
moves upward and when if you get realization,

857
01:25:16,874 --> 01:25:20,378
also it goes back, attends to all these problems
that

858
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:21,385
you have.

859
01:25:21,385 --> 01:25:26,485
It's such a mother she is.

860
01:25:26,485 --> 01:25:29,885
Any other question, please?

861
01:25:29,885 --> 01:25:34,235
Q. Why are you to be known as Mataji, Mother?

862
01:25:34,235 --> 01:25:37,445
Shri Mataji: I didn't follow.

863
01:25:37,445 --> 01:25:41,525
Yogi: Nor did I.

864
01:25:41,525 --> 01:25:44,955
Why are You to be known as Mataji?

865
01:25:44,955 --> 01:25:47,355
Shri Mataji: As Shri Mataji?

866
01:25:58,036 --> 01:26:01,846
That's the title they gave Me, what can I
do?

867
01:26:01,846 --> 01:26:08,596
In India.

868
01:26:08,596 --> 01:26:11,476
You have to be an Indian to understand that.

869
01:26:11,476 --> 01:26:18,956
There are certain things described, about
Shri Mataji.

870
01:26:18,956 --> 01:26:31,846
If you have read any books, of Adi Shankaracharya,
or of Markandeya Himself, then you will know

871
01:26:31,846 --> 01:26:40,746
and the qualities described there of such
a person, if they find it in someone, they

872
01:26:40,746 --> 01:26:45,236
call that person by that name, isn't it?

873
01:26:45,236 --> 01:26:49,796
Like Gandhiji was called as Mahatma Gandhi.

874
01:26:49,796 --> 01:26:57,086
Mahatma means a bigger spirit than others,
because he had that.

875
01:26:57,086 --> 01:27:02,816
He didn't care for himself or his own family,
everything for his own, but he thought of

876
01:27:02,816 --> 01:27:07,946
the whole country; that's why he was called
Mahatma.

877
01:27:07,946 --> 01:27:18,076
Now, but I didn't call Myself; if others want
to call I think is all right, I have no objection.

878
01:27:18,076 --> 01:27:23,736
You can call anything, whatever you see, you
can call that.

879
01:27:23,736 --> 01:27:29,016
By calling that, what is your objection?

880
01:27:29,016 --> 01:27:31,306
Can I ask you this question?

881
01:27:31,306 --> 01:27:32,746
Beg pardon?

882
01:27:32,746 --> 01:27:35,636
[No objection] No objection.

883
01:27:35,636 --> 01:27:39,256
All right, that's all right.

884
01:27:39,256 --> 01:27:48,506
See, then it's all right, if you understand
that it is must be some reason also.

885
01:27:48,506 --> 01:27:52,106
(Further question from same person)

886
01:27:52,106 --> 01:27:54,816
Q. Do you have some divine power?

887
01:27:54,816 --> 01:28:00,976
Shri Mataji: That you better find out; I am
not going to be tactless on that.

888
01:28:00,976 --> 01:28:09,236
Christ said what was the truth, that He was
the Son of God, all right, but they crucified

889
01:28:09,236 --> 01:28:10,886
Him.

890
01:28:10,886 --> 01:28:20,556
I don't want to get crucified so soon.

891
01:28:20,556 --> 01:28:30,956
[INAUDIBLE Q:] But the one who is an Indian,
who is an Indian and Englishman.

892
01:28:30,956 --> 01:28:33,816
[Hindi].

893
01:28:33,816 --> 01:28:55,316
You see
it is for an ... Indians understand it better.

894
01:28:55,316 --> 01:29:10,376
[Hindi]
I'm sorry I'm speaking in Hindi because I

895
01:29:10,376 --> 01:29:26,446
have to little bit chastise the Indians here,
I hope you don't mind.

896
01:29:26,446 --> 01:29:27,746
[Hindi]

897
01:30:30,415 --> 01:30:33,415
Now, what is another question please?

898
01:30:34,431 --> 01:30:35,700
Yes please?

899
01:30:35,977 --> 01:30:37,124
Q. Yogi: Mother, she is

900
01:32:18,283 --> 01:30:49,310
asking if you can cure physical ailment, I
mean the answer's yes, that comes from Self-realization,

901
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:51,003
no question.

902
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:57,064
Shri Mataji with your permission, the majority
of people have come for the experience and

903
01:30:57,170 --> 01:31:04,222
are anxious to have, I may be mistaken, but
I think most people would like to stop questions

904
01:31:04,247 --> 01:31:04,833
and ...

905
01:31:04,858 --> 01:31:07,389
Shri Mataji: But sometimes you know those
who want to ask, let them ask, otherwise the

906
01:31:07,414 --> 01:31:09,225
brain will again put out a question.

907
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:13,510
Now madam, what is it..?

908
01:31:16,115 --> 01:31:17,115
(SY.

909
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:19,855
She's asking You, Mother, what life was like
for You as a child)?

910
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,593
Shri Mataji: As a child?

911
01:31:21,618 --> 01:31:26,548
I mean that's another story; you come and
see Me, I'll tell you all about it.

912
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:35,800
Why do you want to know about My past and
future?

913
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:42,560
Let us at the present time to get your realization;
makes no difference what I was as a child,

914
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,850
or what I was as an old woman.

915
01:31:45,850 --> 01:32:00,080
Yogi: ... She's asking whether you have an
opinion about the growth of interest in spirituality

916
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,080
in England...

917
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,920
Shri Mataji: What spirituality?

918
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:05,750
Yogi asks questioner: spiritualism or spirituality?

919
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:07,170
Questioner answers: spiritualism.

920
01:32:07,170 --> 01:32:11,600
Shri Mataji: That's the witchcraft, revived;
very, very dangerous.

921
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:19,930
Ah, is very dangerous, never go near that,
all this parapsychology and all those things.

922
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:23,060
We have described all these things in our
book; you can have a look at it.

923
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:25,380
Is a very comprehensive thing, Sahaja Yoga
is.

924
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:30,570
Is the witchcraft, you may call it spirituality,
because a spirit can be also a dead soul as

925
01:32:30,570 --> 01:32:32,320
I told you, in English language.

926
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:35,045
There is no 'ism' about God.

927
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:37,589
It's infinite.

928
01:32:38,775 --> 01:32:49,690
'Isms' are all finite things.

929
01:32:49,690 --> 01:33:19,470
Q. SY: she's praising Your lecture, Mother,
and saying now that....she'll go back to read

930
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:20,470
Blake again.

931
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:23,310
Shri Mataji: I'm very happy, I'm very happy
that you say that, madam, it's really such

932
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:27,860
a great poet, but you'll be surprised in India,
none of them brought Blake.

933
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:33,370
We never read Blake there, never; you see
we studied English language, we studied Shakespeare,

934
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:38,220
we studied so many things, but never they
mentioned Blake, you know.

935
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:39,220
I don't know why.

936
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:44,410
In the whole education system of India, they
never mentioned Blake.

937
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:52,760
[another inaudible question ...]
Shri Mataji: That's very nice, such books

938
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:53,820
you must read.

939
01:33:53,820 --> 01:34:00,070
Such books you must read.

940
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:23,550
[Here someone disclaims in Sanskrit]
You see there's a Sanskrit scholar here, but

941
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:27,250
the greatest Guru is the Mother, don't you
think so?

942
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:31,921
The Mother is the Guru of the gurus.

943
01:34:31,946 --> 01:34:37,450
But it's very difficult, because guru is a
hard stuff, you see.

944
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:44,410
A mother has to be very soft, kind, gentle
to manage the show, but the guru can be very

945
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:56,523
hard and they are very hard people, but Mother
as a guru is a difficult task, it's very enjoyable.

946
01:34:56,548 --> 01:35:03,050
Now I have given at least eleven lectures
on Guru tattwa, all right?

947
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:07,612
So you can take tapes from them, you can read
it and you will enjoy it very well.

948
01:35:07,834 --> 01:35:15,280
Here the Guru tattwa is expressed in the Void,
there, where the ten Gurus actually incarnated

949
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,830
basically and they reincarnated.

950
01:35:17,830 --> 01:35:27,480
Say we can start from Adi Nath, then we can
come to other ones like Nanaka, Janaka.

951
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:32,660
Janaka was much earlier, then we can say Abraham,
Moses.

952
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:41,010
All these were Guru tattwa, Socrates, all
these were Guru tattwa people, the people

953
01:35:41,010 --> 01:35:47,104
who came as Prophets; the ones who came on
this earth to teach us balance, to teach us

954
01:35:47,129 --> 01:35:48,485
the code of life.

955
01:35:48,510 --> 01:35:52,070
That was also important part, but that was
forgot.

956
01:35:52,226 --> 01:35:53,226
Why?

957
01:35:53,251 --> 01:35:55,671
Why the code, why the religion?

958
01:35:55,696 --> 01:36:00,340
Religion is for the ascent, to build you up.

959
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:06,140
Q. ?Tattwa
Shri Mataji: Tattwam assi, that's what is

960
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:14,022
the tattwa there; tattwa is there; tattwa
is nothing but your kundalini is your tattwa,

961
01:36:14,047 --> 01:36:17,287
is the principle....

962
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:30,550
Q: [INAUDIBLE] Parvati, Shiva; She's also
called as Kundalini.

963
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:33,990
Shri Mataji: Of course.

964
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:37,980
Yes, yes, it is all over, same thing.

965
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:40,220
I'm just giving you the gist of it.

966
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:51,880
SY: She's asking, Mother, who was Mother Durga,
she's asking about who was Mother Durga?

967
01:36:51,880 --> 01:37:00,030
Shri Mataji: A very direct question; I told
you, I'm very tactful, I'm not going to confess

968
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:01,660
anything.

969
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:05,320
You better find out, it's better to find out.

970
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,850
It's nice, isn't it?

971
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:10,700
To find out yourself.

972
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:20,050
Yogi: ...I'll explain, Mother, the program
is that tonight will be the experience of

973
01:37:20,050 --> 01:37:26,190
realization and we have another program on
Saturday evening, here in the same place,

974
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:31,070
which will be for this knowledge part; after
realization, the knowledge makes more sense,

975
01:37:31,070 --> 01:37:34,040
so it's better to get the experience...

976
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:39,211
Shri Mataji: But our experience is very funny,
I must tell you that for My program, even

977
01:37:39,211 --> 01:37:47,103
if there may be one thousand people, for getting
realization, after that they just get lost,

978
01:37:47,128 --> 01:37:48,268
never grow.

979
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:57,410
That's only more in England, they just don't
... they'll get lost, I think they must be

980
01:37:57,410 --> 01:37:59,110
going to the pub after that.

981
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:04,890
I can't explain why it happens but they just
get lost, they don't want to know anything

982
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:05,890
anymore.

983
01:38:05,890 --> 01:38:10,400
I don't know why, I cannot explain, I mean,
is something I cannot explain.

984
01:38:10,425 --> 01:38:13,425
All right, let's have it now.

985
01:38:13,551 --> 01:38:22,621
So now, if we are all settled down, it's very
simple, Sahaj also means simple, Sahaj; saha

986
01:38:22,621 --> 01:38:29,351
means 'with' ja means 'born'; is born with
you, this right to get this union, this yoga,

987
01:38:29,351 --> 01:38:33,891
is born with you, is within you and is the
living process of the living God so it is

988
01:38:33,891 --> 01:38:34,931
spontaneous.

989
01:38:34,931 --> 01:38:41,141
Everything that is living is spontaneous and
should happen to all of you, no doubt about

990
01:38:41,141 --> 01:38:43,121
it.

991
01:38:43,121 --> 01:38:48,311
You don't have to do anything as I said but
you have to receive the power within yourself,

992
01:38:48,311 --> 01:38:52,451
to invite the kundalini to rise.

993
01:38:52,451 --> 01:38:57,161
Now first thing I have to request, I hope
it is not too much of it, that we have to

994
01:38:57,161 --> 01:38:59,071
take out our shoes to touch the Mother Earth.

995
01:38:59,071 --> 01:39:04,741
Is very important because the Mother Earth
is the one which sucks in, for a while.

996
01:39:04,741 --> 01:39:10,051
I don't know, is there a carpet there?

997
01:39:10,051 --> 01:39:27,741
Be in a mood of reception, and also of well-being,
in a happy mood, because this is the greatest

998
01:39:27,741 --> 01:39:41,001
moment of our lives.

999
01:39:41,001 --> 01:39:48,151
Now as I said that these fingers, here five,
six and seven, on the same way this way, represent

1000
01:39:48,151 --> 01:39:56,231
the two sides of the chakras within us, the
sympathetic sides, so we have to put our hands

1001
01:39:56,231 --> 01:40:03,761
like this, just like this, simple as that.

1002
01:40:03,761 --> 01:40:09,511
And sit, not crossed legged but putting both
the feet with respect, towards the Mother

1003
01:40:09,511 --> 01:40:15,371
Earth, in parallel to each other.

1004
01:40:15,371 --> 01:40:20,221
Now maybe some of you must have started feeling
the cool breeze, I don't know, might have,

1005
01:40:20,221 --> 01:40:24,371
because today's lecture was rather too terrific
and William Blake must have worked it out

1006
01:40:24,371 --> 01:40:28,161
I'm sure.

1007
01:40:28,161 --> 01:40:31,051
But otherwise is very simple.

1008
01:40:31,051 --> 01:40:36,691
Now we have to do is to ourselves awaken our
own kundalini, which is very simple, which

1009
01:40:36,691 --> 01:40:38,021
I will tell you.

1010
01:40:38,021 --> 01:40:43,651
In the heart resides the spirit so first we'll
have to put our hand to our heart.

1011
01:40:43,651 --> 01:40:46,451
I will tell you one by one.

1012
01:40:46,451 --> 01:40:51,282
And then in the upper part of your stomach
where the guru tattwa is here, the principle

1013
01:40:51,282 --> 01:40:53,471
of guru is there.

1014
01:40:53,471 --> 01:41:11,051
Then in the lower part of the abdomen, where
it is the divine, or we can say the pure knowledge

1015
01:41:11,051 --> 01:41:13,801
that exists and which works.

1016
01:41:13,801 --> 01:41:21,491
This is the center through which the pure
knowledge, the pure technique, works.

1017
01:41:21,491 --> 01:41:36,401
Then we take this hand again back, same way,
up to this point where, it is here, when we

1018
01:41:36,401 --> 01:41:40,901
are guilty we catch this chakra.

1019
01:41:40,901 --> 01:41:48,111
Now here works our self-confidence, our faith
in God that He forgives us.

1020
01:41:48,111 --> 01:41:56,461
Then we put our hand on top of our head - this
is the Agnya Chakra, which is very important.

1021
01:41:56,461 --> 01:42:03,161
Here we forgive everyone; then at the back
of the Agnya Chakra again, where we have to

1022
01:42:03,161 --> 01:42:06,971
say that, "If we done any mistake, oh God
forgive us".

1023
01:42:06,971 --> 01:42:10,031
These are the two sides of the Agnya Chakra.

1024
01:42:10,031 --> 01:42:17,331
And then you put your hand, stretch it, put
this part on the fontanel bone area, the soft

1025
01:42:17,331 --> 01:42:25,971
bone which was on top of our head and press
it hard and move it hard, for a while.

1026
01:42:25,971 --> 01:42:27,071
That's all one has to do.

1027
01:42:27,071 --> 01:42:28,981
I'll tell you one by one.

1028
01:42:28,981 --> 01:42:35,061
First and foremost thing is, we have to close
our eyes, because eyes take out our attention;

1029
01:42:35,061 --> 01:42:42,051
but attention will be sucked inside our body
in the sense it will go through the - just

1030
01:42:42,051 --> 01:42:47,661
like this cloth - it is spread out, but as
kundalini rises, She sucks it in and then

1031
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:55,071
pierces through this attention, enlight[en]ing
all of that.

1032
01:42:55,071 --> 01:42:59,721
It's a happening that takes place without
any trouble whatsoever.

1033
01:42:59,721 --> 01:43:08,011
As a result of that, what you get is the cool
breeze coming out of your head; you can also

1034
01:43:08,011 --> 01:43:17,751
feel the cool breeze in your fingertips; then
later on in your hands and you get that shine

1035
01:43:17,751 --> 01:43:19,801
on your skin.

1036
01:43:19,801 --> 01:43:26,841
Christ has said, "The face that does not shine
cannot become the star."

1037
01:43:26,841 --> 01:43:32,921
And then you get that glint of shine of the
spirit in your eyes.

1038
01:43:32,921 --> 01:43:43,031
That's all, is not the point, is much, much,
much, much more but just a wee bit that we

1039
01:43:43,031 --> 01:43:49,691
have to today testify and later on to find
out have we got realization all right, then

1040
01:43:49,691 --> 01:43:56,541
can we work it out, can we do this, because
later on we have to play our role now as a

1041
01:43:56,541 --> 01:44:00,771
spiritual being, that's the point one has
to understand.

1042
01:44:00,771 --> 01:44:09,211
So now, have respect for yourself first of
all; and not to feel guilty at all.

1043
01:44:09,211 --> 01:44:16,871
You are the temple of God, really believe
Me you are made that way, only the light is

1044
01:44:16,871 --> 01:44:20,391
to be kindled and that is in your heart.

1045
01:44:20,391 --> 01:44:25,751
When the kundalini rises, she's something
like an energy that does that because when

1046
01:44:25,751 --> 01:44:33,371
she pierces through, this is the place where
the God Almighty resides, who is reflected

1047
01:44:33,371 --> 01:44:45,101
in our heart as the spirit and the all-pervading
power, which is the Primordial Mother, the

1048
01:44:45,101 --> 01:44:53,062
Holy Ghost, this vibrations that you feel,
the power of God, the love of God which is

1049
01:44:53,062 --> 01:45:03,231
represented within us as the kundalini, rises
and unites us, our attention to the Divine.

1050
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:12,371
The spirit enlightens the attention and by
that enlightenment you know, on your fingertips,

1051
01:45:12,371 --> 01:45:18,511
on your central nervous system, through your
new collective consciousness about yourself

1052
01:45:18,511 --> 01:45:19,781
and about others.

1053
01:45:19,781 --> 01:45:28,611
Through Sahaja Yoga you know how to cure,
improve, and through this happening, through

1054
01:45:28,611 --> 01:45:36,701
the spirit you enjoy because spirit - the
nature of spirit is satchidanand, means it

1055
01:45:36,701 --> 01:45:44,061
is the truth, it becomes the attention and
it is the source of joy.

1056
01:45:44,061 --> 01:45:51,261
Without getting realization you can be happy
and unhappy but you cannot be joy, which has

1057
01:45:51,261 --> 01:45:52,951
no dualism.

1058
01:45:52,951 --> 01:45:55,341
You become the source of joy.

1059
01:45:55,341 --> 01:46:03,531
Such a person, when he meets someone; he sees
someone, he looks at someone, just a kataksh

1060
01:46:03,531 --> 01:46:11,241
is sufficient to raise the kundalini - just
a glance is sufficient to cure that person;

1061
01:46:11,241 --> 01:46:16,391
just a thought, can give comfort to the other
person.

1062
01:46:16,391 --> 01:46:21,651
Miracles after miracles, so many miracles
that as Sahaja yogis say, "miracle' has lost

1063
01:46:21,651 --> 01:46:25,391
its meaning Mother, in Sahaja Yoga," that's
true.

1064
01:46:25,391 --> 01:46:32,421
So miracles of miracles and every moment you
feel that God is looking after you.

1065
01:46:32,421 --> 01:46:45,801
When this great volcano burst, exploded in
Mexico, a miracle happened they say, that

1066
01:46:45,801 --> 01:46:48,291
the children were saved.

1067
01:46:48,291 --> 01:46:57,191
The wrath - no this was not in Mexico but
later on more in Colombia, because Colombia

1068
01:46:57,191 --> 01:47:04,151
is sending all kinds of these horrible things
all over the world, making money out of it.

1069
01:47:04,151 --> 01:47:13,381
The wrath of the Mother Earth poured that
mud and the people were drowned but the children

1070
01:47:13,381 --> 01:47:14,381
survived.

1071
01:47:14,381 --> 01:47:18,431
Their heads were above the mud, the body inside
the mud.

1072
01:47:18,431 --> 01:47:24,161
The same Mother Earth looked after them because
they should not be burned so She covered them

1073
01:47:24,161 --> 01:47:26,671
with the mud, why?

1074
01:47:26,671 --> 01:47:29,931
Because of the innocence in them.

1075
01:47:29,931 --> 01:47:36,081
Those who have even the slightest innocence
in them will become realized souls, no doubt

1076
01:47:36,081 --> 01:47:41,151
about it - slightest, a very wee bit.

1077
01:47:41,151 --> 01:47:46,931
All the seekers are a special category of
people and they have to become realized souls.

1078
01:47:46,931 --> 01:47:51,361
So forget about the past, forget whatever
you have done in your seeking, whatever you

1079
01:47:51,361 --> 01:47:59,081
are told, whatever you are branded with, just
forget it and forgive yourself, once for all.

1080
01:47:59,081 --> 01:48:03,701
This is I am telling you this because this
is one of the biggest problems of the West

1081
01:48:03,701 --> 01:48:09,771
that everybody sits down with a bad, horrible
trouble here and sometimes I feel it so much

1082
01:48:09,771 --> 01:48:12,821
that I can't even hear people.

1083
01:48:12,821 --> 01:48:13,821
Is terrible.

1084
01:48:13,821 --> 01:48:20,851
This portion is so bad here so I have to request
you that please forgive yourself.

1085
01:48:20,851 --> 01:48:27,681
You are the glory of God, without you God
has no meaning also.

1086
01:48:27,681 --> 01:48:32,231
It is He who is anxious, much more then you
are, to give you realization.

1087
01:48:32,231 --> 01:48:33,981
Just help Him out a little.

1088
01:48:33,981 --> 01:48:34,981
All right.

1089
01:48:34,981 --> 01:48:35,981
Let us see.

1090
01:48:35,981 --> 01:48:41,631
So we put our both the hands like this, close
our eyes.

1091
01:48:41,631 --> 01:48:47,921
Now you have to keep the left hand all the
time towards Me, because is the desire, is

1092
01:48:47,921 --> 01:48:52,391
expressed through it is the power of desire
in the left hand which expresses that you

1093
01:48:52,391 --> 01:48:53,521
want to have realization.

1094
01:48:53,521 --> 01:48:58,941
The right hand is the power of action so you
move your right hand but don't open your eyes.

1095
01:48:58,941 --> 01:49:06,371
You have to keep your eyes all the time shut,
just the opposite of mesmerism as you can

1096
01:49:06,371 --> 01:49:07,491
see.

1097
01:49:07,491 --> 01:49:26,431
Now please close your eyes; now put your right
hand on your heart.

1098
01:49:26,431 --> 01:49:37,941
Now here you have to say, or ask Me a question,
"Mother am I the spirit?"

1099
01:49:37,941 --> 01:49:41,451
You may call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever
suits you.

1100
01:49:41,451 --> 01:49:46,271
"Mother am I the spirit?" is a fundamental
question and if you are a computer it will

1101
01:49:46,271 --> 01:49:47,271
answer.

1102
01:49:47,271 --> 01:49:49,241
"Mother am I the spirit?"

1103
01:49:49,241 --> 01:49:51,511
Ask the question three times please.

1104
01:49:51,511 --> 01:50:01,971
Put your left hand properly, please close
your eyes; everybody should do it, please.

1105
01:50:01,971 --> 01:50:09,831
It's uncivil not to close your eyes; please
close your eyes because others may feel self-conscious

1106
01:50:09,831 --> 01:50:20,381
so please close your eyes, to be courteous.

1107
01:50:20,381 --> 01:50:27,181
Now you have to take down your right hand
on the upper part of your stomach, on the

1108
01:50:27,181 --> 01:50:31,231
left hand side, we are working only on the
left hand side.

1109
01:50:31,231 --> 01:50:37,451
Here is the principle of the master.

1110
01:50:37,451 --> 01:50:42,291
If you are the spirit, automatically you have
to ask the second question, "Mother am I my

1111
01:50:42,291 --> 01:50:44,511
own master?

1112
01:50:44,511 --> 01:50:46,641
Mother am I my own guru?"

1113
01:50:46,641 --> 01:50:53,861
Please ask this question, you have to ask
this question three times again, without fear,

1114
01:50:53,861 --> 01:51:09,091
with all confidence you ask this question,
you are the spirit, you are your master.

1115
01:51:09,091 --> 01:51:18,591
Now move your right hand on the lower part
of your abdomen on the left hand side, lower

1116
01:51:18,591 --> 01:51:20,931
part of your abdomen on the left hand side.

1117
01:51:20,931 --> 01:51:30,731
This is the center of the divine work, of
the divine knowledge or the pure knowledge,

1118
01:51:30,731 --> 01:51:35,481
of the technique of divine manifestation.

1119
01:51:35,481 --> 01:51:45,282
At this point I cannot force you to do anything,
as I told you, you have to be free, I can

1120
01:51:45,282 --> 01:51:52,121
only request you and here I say that you have
to ask for the divine knowledge, you have

1121
01:51:52,121 --> 01:52:00,201
to ask for the pure knowledge and when you
ask for it the kundalini will start moving.

1122
01:52:00,201 --> 01:52:08,881
Here with sincere heart, in a humble way you
have to say, "Mother may I have the pure knowledge,

1123
01:52:08,881 --> 01:52:13,941
Mother may I have the divine technique?"

1124
01:52:13,941 --> 01:52:38,141
Ask this question six times because this center
has got six petals.

1125
01:52:38,141 --> 01:53:04,851
Now to make the way easy for kundalini, we
go along the same centers upwards so you put

1126
01:53:04,851 --> 01:53:12,601
your right hand on the upper part of your
abdomen, to make it easy for the kundalini

1127
01:53:12,601 --> 01:53:26,681
to rise you have to open this center by asserting,
by saying "Mother I am my own master", by

1128
01:53:26,681 --> 01:53:52,151
saying "Mother I am my own master", ten times
because there are ten petals, ten Sat gurus

1129
01:53:52,151 --> 01:54:24,391
basically who incarnate ten times, of Prophets,
the Masters.

1130
01:54:24,391 --> 01:54:30,391
Now raise your right hand on your heart, press
it.

1131
01:54:30,391 --> 01:54:44,051
With the same confidence you have to say twelve
times "Mother I am the spirit, I am the spirit,

1132
01:54:44,051 --> 01:54:47,601
I am the spirit".

1133
01:54:47,601 --> 01:55:04,081
Just assert, that's a fact, that's the truth.

1134
01:55:04,081 --> 01:55:14,771
Press it with your fingers.

1135
01:55:14,771 --> 01:55:26,411
Now, twelve times, have full confidence in
you, believe Me you are the spirit, you have

1136
01:55:26,411 --> 01:55:32,301
to just become in the sense it has to come
in your attention on to your central nervous

1137
01:55:32,301 --> 01:55:58,761
system.

1138
01:55:58,761 --> 01:56:10,971
Now raise the right hand on the left hand
side of your neck, in the corner where the

1139
01:56:10,971 --> 01:56:15,841
neck and the shoulder meet, press it hard,
take it backwards, press it hard.

1140
01:56:15,841 --> 01:56:21,271
This is the most difficult center in the West,
as I told you, that we feel guilty all the

1141
01:56:21,271 --> 01:56:32,231
time but as I have told you, God is the ocean
of love, ocean of compassion, but above all

1142
01:56:32,231 --> 01:56:34,371
He is the ocean of forgiveness.

1143
01:56:34,371 --> 01:56:38,031
He's the ocean of forgiveness.

1144
01:56:38,031 --> 01:56:46,951
When He's the ocean of forgiveness, what guilt
can we have that He cannot wash away or dissolve

1145
01:56:46,951 --> 01:56:47,951
it?

1146
01:56:47,951 --> 01:56:55,051
So just you have to say sixteen times because
there are sixteen petals, to say sixteen times

1147
01:56:55,051 --> 01:57:00,161
with full belief in yourself, "Mother I'm
not guilty, Mother, I'm not guilty, Mother,

1148
01:57:00,161 --> 01:57:48,541
I'm not guilty" sixteen times will you please
say that "Shri Mataji I'm not guilty".

1149
01:57:48,541 --> 01:57:53,381
If you still feel you are guilty and you can't
forgive yourself, better say it to punish

1150
01:57:53,381 --> 01:58:09,771
yourself hundred and eight times, if that
pleases you.

1151
01:58:09,771 --> 01:58:31,231
When you forgive yourself you have to forgive
others and so the greatest message of Christ,

1152
01:58:31,231 --> 01:58:39,081
that we have to forgive others you have to
put your hand to the center which is the adornment

1153
01:58:39,081 --> 01:58:46,721
or we should say which adorns Christ, on the
Agnya Chakra on your forehead, please put

1154
01:58:46,721 --> 01:58:49,141
your right hand across,.

1155
01:58:49,141 --> 01:59:05,491
Press it hard and here you have to say with
full belief in yourself and in your powers

1156
01:59:05,491 --> 01:59:11,811
that, "Shri Mataji I forgive everyone".

1157
01:59:11,811 --> 01:59:16,891
Some may say that's very difficult but what
do we do when we forgive or not forgive - no

1158
01:59:16,891 --> 01:59:18,051
logic in it.

1159
01:59:18,051 --> 01:59:28,081
But when we say that, then we are out of the
clutches of other people, so please say, "Shri

1160
01:59:28,081 --> 01:59:30,931
Mataji I forgive everyone.

1161
01:59:30,931 --> 01:59:50,701
Now say it with your whole heart, how many
times is not the point, please say it with

1162
01:59:50,701 --> 01:59:51,701
your whole heart.

1163
01:59:51,701 --> 01:59:56,701
Now you move your hand backwards onto the
back side of the same center - Agnya - press

1164
01:59:56,701 --> 01:59:58,541
it hard.

1165
01:59:58,541 --> 02:00:09,661
Now here, you have to say once only without
feeling guilty at all, without feeling no

1166
02:00:09,661 --> 02:00:17,491
remorse, no condemnation, to God, one for
your satisfaction, "Oh Lord, if I have done

1167
02:00:17,491 --> 02:00:26,081
anything wrong, please forgive me" but don't
feel guilty, that's very important.

1168
02:00:26,081 --> 02:00:36,811
Even without saying He has forgiven you.

1169
02:00:36,811 --> 02:00:39,021
Better.

1170
02:00:39,021 --> 02:00:46,632
Now raise your right hand on top of your head,
stretch your ... stretch your palm, press

1171
02:00:46,632 --> 02:00:55,741
it hard on the fontanel bone area, which was
the soft bone in your childhood, press it

1172
02:00:55,741 --> 02:00:57,891
hard, move it seven times.

1173
02:00:57,891 --> 02:01:02,451
Again here I cannot force anything on you.

1174
02:01:02,451 --> 02:01:09,721
You have to say that you want your Self-realization
that, "Mother, please give us our realization.

1175
02:01:09,721 --> 02:01:11,971
We want our Self-realization.

1176
02:01:11,971 --> 02:01:20,361
Please give me my Self-realization" and press
it hard and move it seven times and say that.

1177
02:01:20,361 --> 02:01:34,721
I'm sure it will work out.

1178
02:01:34,721 --> 02:02:15,411
Now bring down your hand, slowly, and bend
your head a little bit and feel with your

1179
02:02:15,411 --> 02:02:38,811
left hand if there's a cool breeze coming
out of your fontanel bone area.

1180
02:02:38,811 --> 02:02:43,681
Try to bend your head a little, little bit
and about four inches above the head, bend

1181
02:02:43,681 --> 02:02:48,101
it a little, that works out better sometimes.

1182
02:02:48,101 --> 02:03:01,641
With your left hand, right hand towards Me
and with the left hand you see the breeze.

1183
02:03:01,641 --> 02:03:06,331
Right hand towards Me and then with the left
hand you see, you can feel it better, with

1184
02:03:06,331 --> 02:03:11,201
the left hand on top of your head; first with
the left hand.

1185
02:03:11,201 --> 02:03:12,621
Aah.

1186
02:03:12,621 --> 02:03:19,971
Now put the left hand towards Me and with
the right hand just see if it is blowing because

1187
02:03:19,971 --> 02:03:22,071
it should come in both the hands.

1188
02:03:22,071 --> 02:03:30,831
Open your eyes, open slowly and watch Me without
thinking.

1189
02:03:30,831 --> 02:03:42,161
Let us see if you can do it - just without
thinking, just watch Me, without thinking.

1190
02:03:42,161 --> 02:03:52,641
There's no thought in your mind, no thought.

1191
02:03:52,641 --> 02:04:03,471
Now just put your hands like this, are you
feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

1192
02:04:03,471 --> 02:04:09,461
Now put your hands up in the air, like this,
and in your heart ask a question, "Is this

1193
02:04:09,461 --> 02:04:11,611
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

1194
02:04:11,611 --> 02:04:17,361
Ask the question, put it up nicely, ask the
question three times: "Is this the cool breeze

1195
02:04:17,361 --> 02:04:19,051
of the Holy Ghost?

1196
02:04:19,051 --> 02:04:21,961
Is this the brahma shakti?

1197
02:04:21,961 --> 02:04:26,361
Is this the all-pervading power of God?

1198
02:04:26,361 --> 02:04:31,101
Ask the question.

1199
02:04:31,101 --> 02:04:39,691
Now put down your hands and see for yourself
if you feel the cool breeze.

1200
02:04:39,691 --> 02:04:50,201
All those who have felt the cool breeze on
the head, coming out of the head, or on their

1201
02:04:50,201 --> 02:05:00,911
fingertips or in the hands please raise your
hands, both the hands.

1202
02:05:00,911 --> 02:05:01,911
That's Blake.

1203
02:05:01,911 --> 02:05:03,391
You all have become Blake.

1204
02:05:03,391 --> 02:05:07,221
May God bless you.

1205
02:05:07,221 --> 02:05:08,541
So many.

1206
02:05:08,541 --> 02:05:09,701
May God bless you.

1207
02:05:09,701 --> 02:05:15,611
But I must warn you, after this don't talk
about it because it is beyond reasoning.

1208
02:05:15,611 --> 02:05:22,061
Secondly you must come back, must all of you
come back and work it out.

1209
02:05:22,061 --> 02:05:27,351
Those who haven't got realization will also
receive it.

1210
02:05:27,351 --> 02:05:30,571
Those who have got it, will establish it.

1211
02:05:30,571 --> 02:05:31,961
Please come back.

1212
02:05:31,961 --> 02:05:40,161
You will enjoy the silence, the stillness
within.

1213
02:05:40,161 --> 02:05:42,961
But that's just the beginning of it.

1214
02:05:42,961 --> 02:05:45,221
We have to go further.

1215
02:05:45,221 --> 02:05:50,221
Otherwise you won't be able to manifest it
properly.

1216
02:05:50,221 --> 02:05:51,801
It has to be looked after.

1217
02:05:51,801 --> 02:06:01,458
It's just a shoot that has come out, a little
shoot we have to look after it.

1218
02:06:01,483 --> 02:06:04,483
May God bless you all.

1219
02:06:04,588 --> 02:06:09,818
Thank-you very much.

1220
02:06:09,818 --> 02:06:29,250
Why not sing Jerusalem to them ... will be
good idea.

1221
02:06:29,275 --> 02:06:36,422
Yogi: Mother with Your permission the music
group would like to sing one song for You

1222
02:06:36,463 --> 02:06:41,541
but before that we have a little memento of
this evening which we would like to present.

1223
02:06:41,761 --> 02:06:44,144
Shri Mataji: You want to sing, all right?

1224
02:06:44,169 --> 02:06:47,246
You have all the arrangements here.

1225
02:06:47,271 --> 02:06:48,271
All right.

1226
02:06:48,271 --> 02:06:51,206
If you don't mind, just sit down for five
minutes.

1227
02:06:52,041 --> 02:06:57,366
Yogi: So Garuda take wing.

1228
02:07:37,244 --> 02:07:43,097
While we were preparing the program of Blake's
Birthday Festival Mother, we found out there

1229
02:07:43,097 --> 02:07:50,862
was an Exhibition of Blake's work in London
in one of the galleries and we very much wanted

1230
02:07:50,887 --> 02:07:59,574
to give You something that was made by His
own Hands and with the good wishes of all

1231
02:07:59,599 --> 02:08:04,689
the Sahaja yogis of England we've been able
to do it for You.

1232
02:08:04,714 --> 02:08:07,942
Shri Mataji: Oh that's too much, that's too
much Gavin, that's too much.

1233
02:08:07,967 --> 02:08:14,221
Yogi: No it's something special Mother, we
hope that it'll be our pledge to try to do

1234
02:08:14,246 --> 02:08:19,141
some justice to You as You've tried to do
some justice to Blake.

1235
02:08:19,166 --> 02:08:21,061
Shri Mataji: I'm so proud of Him, really.

1236
02:08:21,086 --> 02:08:24,843
Can you - I am not good at opening.

1237
02:08:33,652 --> 02:08:34,856
Done so well.

1238
02:09:10,304 --> 02:09:10,877
Ohh.

1239
02:09:10,941 --> 02:09:13,164
What a beautiful one.

1240
02:09:14,130 --> 02:09:15,507
Trigunatmika.

1241
02:09:15,532 --> 02:09:19,390
Do you see the trigunatmika is there?

1242
02:09:19,773 --> 02:09:20,773
What a vision.

1243
02:09:20,798 --> 02:09:24,963
I mean how can you understand Him without
Sahaja Yoga ... picture, you cannot ... May

1244
02:09:25,257 --> 02:09:26,257
God bless you.

1245
02:09:26,257 --> 02:09:27,257
Thank-you very much

1246
02:09:41,593 --> 02:09:51,113
Yogi: This is the engraving of the Daughters
of Job from the illustrations to Book of Job.

1247
02:09:51,113 --> 02:09:52,113
Shri Mataji: What is?

1248
02:09:52,113 --> 02:09:53,113
Yogi: Daughters of Job.

1249
02:09:53,113 --> 02:09:54,570
Shri Mataji: Trigunatmika.

1250
02:09:54,595 --> 02:10:06,875
Three Powers - the Comforter, and the Counselor
and the Redeemer, three Powers, which you

1251
02:10:06,900 --> 02:10:08,081
will know, later on.

1252
02:10:08,106 --> 02:10:10,463
We have those three Powers within ourselves.

1253
02:10:12,328 --> 02:10:13,328
Go ahead.

1254
02:10:31,261 --> 02:10:32,261
Yogi: [INAUDIBLE]
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

1255
02:10:35,447 --> 02:10:37,253
[The mike is not all right.

1256
02:10:37,423 --> 02:10:38,882
Loudly.]

1257
02:10:44,892 --> 02:10:45,892
Song: 'Seek and You Will Find'.

1258
02:10:45,892 --> 02:10:46,892
Song: 'Jerusalem.'

1259
02:17:59,482 --> 02:18:02,215
Yogi: We'd like everyone to stand up to sing
Jerusalem.

1260
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:52,725
Shri Mataji: May God bless you all and bless
this country.

1261
02:20:54,943 --> 02:20:57,943
May God bless you.
