1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:11,710
I went to your radio broadcasting
and people told Me

2
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:23,249
that, "It is very difficult to believe, that
we can get Self-realization so easily."

3
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:36,335
Also that, "The whole thing sounds so 
fantastic, so great and how can

4
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:40,898
we human-beings get our realization
so fast."

5
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:50,852
We must know that we have not created
ourselves

6
00:00:54,423 --> 00:01:01,693
and we cannot create ourselves either; We
can destroy but we have not created ourselves.

7
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:09,906
Some energy, some force - call it God, 
call it anything - has created us

8
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:20,392
and the way we have become human-beings,
one can see very clearly,

9
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:34,983
there has to be some purpose. If so,
then we have to find out that purpose.

10
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:48,893
Logically, we reach a conclusion, that
whatever we know today about ourselves

11
00:01:48,893 --> 00:02:04,138
and our being and our purpose, is not 
sufficient to convince us of

12
00:02:05,498 --> 00:02:12,217
our importance, of our glory and the
need for this force to create us.

13
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:28,957
To understand what it is, why are we
here, why are we made human-beings

14
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:39,055
- are we able to find out with this
human instrument we have got?

15
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:43,928
With our human awareness can we
find out why are we here,

16
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:55,698
why are we made or is there anything
else provided within us that can give us

17
00:03:01,243 --> 00:03:13,663
the ideas, the knowledge about ourselves.
One thing is definite, we must understand

18
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:22,144
that in these modern times, there are many
people born, who do not accept life as it is.

19
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:31,669
They perhaps do not know for what purpose
but they want to deny and defy a revolt against

20
00:03:34,387 --> 00:03:38,787
the mundane type of life they think
there's something missing in it.

21
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,660
They have not been able to find why they
are here. Perhaps, they think

22
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:51,622
the joy is missing in life and what
is the purpose of our life.

23
00:03:56,627 --> 00:04:06,147
But when we start our search in this 
direction to find why we are restless,

24
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:12,227
why we are dissatisfied, then we get lost.

25
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:25,920
It's like, we have come now to Brighton by
train and there is no train to go to a

26
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,594
particular point any more. Now, if you 
give up the train, there is no bridge

27
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:37,794
and how to reach there. Everything seems
to be unknown also we do not know

28
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:43,384
what are we seeking, though we feel that we 
are seeking the Truth behind everything else.

29
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:56,429
Then, with our reasoning, we have to
understand what are we seeking

30
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:01,480
first of all. Then how are we to seek?

31
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:14,526
The normal way of seeking anything,
for example, your power, your money

32
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:22,898
your wealth, has to be changed. There
has to be some other method by which

33
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:29,554
you have to seek that which is
innately missing in you

34
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:39,924
and that cannot be anything that
you have known so far.

35
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:46,742
If you had known that so far, you 
would not have been seeking.

36
00:05:48,652 --> 00:06:00,922
You go to Science, you go to Arts, you go 
to any field of knowledge, you will find

37
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:13,782
there is no way by which you can be guided
to this new awareness that you are seeking

38
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:21,200
Naturally, you are mislaid - anybody can
mislead you because you are going to an

39
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:31,230
unknown realm and anybody can mislead
you. Moreover, there are so many books

40
00:06:31,987 --> 00:06:41,327
about the unknown that it is not easy for us
to discriminate. We have got person like Hume,

41
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:51,580
who doesn't have much support in U.K.,
who was a realized soul and what he talked

42
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:59,493
about the Truth, according to Me, is perfect.
Then, we have another one, called Mr. Freud,

43
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:07,917
whom I call a very half-baked gentleman,
while many would not agree with Me there

44
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:17,360
and there could be so many like that, 
where we do not know how to discriminate.

45
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,980
So many books have appeared, so many
things have been placed before you,

46
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:32,330
so many ideologies, so many fake gurus
- I could be one of them same time,

47
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:39,826
maybe trying to deceive you to get something
out of you - possible. All these things are

48
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:49,788
so much, that I can understand you all are
so much confused. But if I were a seeker,

49
00:07:51,277 --> 00:08:01,277
in a simple way, obviously, what would
I do? First of all, supposing, you are

50
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:06,723
going into a market-place to buy
something, what do you do?

51
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:18,380
You go and find out from others, those
who have purchased things from the place,

52
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:24,930
how it is. Is it good, is it doing good
to you, is it working alright?

53
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:31,295
You just don't buy anything
because it is advertised;

54
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:46,426
At least a shallow person may do such a
thing but not a person, who has earned

55
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:51,340
his money with great difficulties and who
understands the value of his money.

56
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,490
He won't just go by and buy something
because it is advertised in a big way.

57
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:04,549
So, what are the things that one has to do,
is to find out, those who have been going

58
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:11,900
to all these different alternatives, what
have they achieved and what am I going

59
00:09:11,902 --> 00:09:19,952
to achieve it? Now the first thing we say
that, you get something in your awareness

60
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:27,266
if it is a living evolutionary process. In
your awareness you have a sense of color

61
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:35,679
you have a sense of beauty, you have a 
sense of cleanliness. In your awareness,

62
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:46,435
means in your Central Nervous System,
whatever you have achieved, you can feel it

63
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:55,279
and understand it. If some thing is hot,
you know it is hot, if something is tasty,

64
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,933
you know it is tasty; In the same way, the
Central Nervous System that is built-in

65
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:11,919
within you, which is your own, you
should feel whatever you have achieved.

66
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:18,869
It's not just a, sort of a, brainwash
people can give you. Like if I say,

67
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:23,285
alright, this is not red - this is green.
You say,

68
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:28,316
"No, I see it red and it is red - that's
the truth - I can see it with my eyes."

69
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:35,167
Supposing I say, "No, this is not wood, 
this is foam," you can feel it, "No,

70
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:44,573
this is definitely wood not foam," you can
feel it and as a seeker you must know that

71
00:10:44,573 --> 00:10:52,654
you have to feel it yourself, not your 
emotional methods, not your mental method.

72
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:58,533
To a person emotionally a flower may be
very important because it's given to

73
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:08,456
her or him by somebody whom he loved
very much but to everyone that feeling

74
00:11:08,456 --> 00:11:14,124
should be the same. Wood should be the
same for everyone of you. God should be

75
00:11:14,124 --> 00:11:22,791
the same for all of you by all it's tests
- then you have found something.

76
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:30,711
It cannot be the whim of one person, "O, I've
found God. Now I'm great, I've done this, I'm,"

77
00:11:31,678 --> 00:11:42,878
but, what is the criteria? It has to be a
criteria which is supported by everyone

78
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:49,669
but here also they can beat you, I can
tell you. Supposing, I have a power

79
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:55,785
by which I mesmerize all of you. You'll all say
that, "Our Mother is this, Mother is that."

80
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:06,278
Here, we should go further to understand
that you may say anything about Me

81
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:13,478
or say, "I'm above everything and
I'm this and I'm that,"

82
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:19,128
and anybody can say like that
and advertise about Me

83
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:27,668
but to you, who is a seeker, that's
not important. You are not going to be

84
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:33,312
a hero worshipper. Just to worship
somebody because you think that

85
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:38,137
such a big hero is there - now those days
are gone. The days have come when you

86
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:44,782
have to become the hero, where you
have to become something.

87
00:12:48,512 --> 00:12:53,422
A time was there where there were
very few horse-riders,

88
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:59,162
so we used to be enamored by them,
"Oh, such a one is there."

89
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:05,012
Even today, the footballers. We appreciate
them, they are our heroes,

90
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:11,175
watch them, the globe-trotters, we watch
them but today you have to become that,

91
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:18,498
you have to become your master, you have
to know everything; That is the time today

92
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:26,312
otherwise no use seeking. Are you seeking
another hero for yourself? Is that hero

93
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:33,769
going to take you somewhere or he's just
going to use you for his own hero worship?

94
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:41,412
So, the second point is that what
have you become out of it.

95
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:46,244
When you see somebody,
whom you want to judge -

96
00:13:48,391 --> 00:13:56,511
a disciple of anyone - you should know 
what have you got, what did you gain

97
00:13:56,821 --> 00:14:06,011
because you have to gain something out of
it. That's how, you will start neutralizing

98
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:20,001
many people and the last of all, if the
seeking has to be fulfilled, it cannot be

99
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:23,987
done the way you have been doing all
other things like paying money.

100
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:36,260
If you pay money, you might even get a
seat in the Parliament, maybe or maybe that,

101
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:43,345
if you do some social service or something,
you might might gain popular votes

102
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:52,063
but you have to change that - that is not
the way you are going to achieve.

103
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:59,937
In this new realm of seeking, it has to
be a living process of evolution.

104
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:12,564
Under these circumstances, when it is going to
be a new method, it has to be a living method.

105
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:18,205
Please come, here there's a room here.
Yes, there's room here. It's alright.

106
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:24,493
Now, the living method we, human-beings
don't know. We know and we don't know.

107
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:32,960
For example, as I told you yesterday, if
you have to sprout the seed, then

108
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:39,855
you know that you have to put it in the
Mother Earth and it will sprout but

109
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:45,920
you don't know how it works; You don't 
know that. Anything living you do not know

110
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:52,703
but you know how it happens. You do not
know how to convert a flower into a fruit

111
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:59,998
- you do not know, despite all your Science,
everything put together but the living process

112
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:05,921
produces all these results, this you know 
but how it works, that you don't know.

113
00:16:07,888 --> 00:16:15,808
So, if it is the living process, it's a
very different method, which is not so far

114
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:25,686
known to human-beings. So, logically you 
reach a point, where you try to understand

115
00:16:25,686 --> 00:16:34,273
the living processes, how they work. Firstly,
all living processes are spontaneous -

116
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:40,653
they are not deliberations. For example, our
breathing itself, is a living process within us

117
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:46,532
worked out by Autonomous Nervous System.
Now, to understand our breathing, if you

118
00:16:46,532 --> 00:16:51,298
have to go to a library or to a University
or to a guru, how many will survive?

119
00:16:54,691 --> 00:17:07,971
So, it has to be the easiest, simplest, 
spontaneous and intelligible to everyone of us.

120
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:11,936
You need not be a graduate [ASIDE - You
come this side please, if you don't mind.

121
00:17:11,936 --> 00:17:22,082
You can come - there's a room
there also.] You can not maneuvre

122
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:31,138
or work out a living process.
It works by itself - sahaja.

123
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:38,297
Sahaja - 'Saha' means with, 'ja' 
means born. It is born with you.

124
00:17:39,072 --> 00:17:47,222
Yoga means union with the Divine. Now many
people think standing on your head is yoga;

125
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:57,308
I think, it's a misnomer there. 
Yoga means yukti, means the joining.

126
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,250
If standing on the head means yoga, means
you are joining your head with the Mother

127
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:15,589
Earth or something like that, it might
be. Joining of your attention with

128
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:23,642
yourself, is yoga to begin with because
unless and until you know yourself,

129
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:33,300
how are you going to know the rest of it.
So yoga means union with yourselves,

130
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:45,293
which enables you to get united with the Divine,
with the All-Pervading Power of Divinity.

131
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:53,200
To an intelligent man, it's all Greek and Latin,
I understand because you have never heard,

132
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:02,044
perhaps, in your books about Divine.
Whatever is done, that is living,

133
00:19:02,044 --> 00:19:10,054
is done by this Divine Power and because
we are not yet Divine, we cannot do it,

134
00:19:10,054 --> 00:19:19,345
we cannot maneuver it but once we become
Divine, we can manoevre it, so now we have to

135
00:19:19,345 --> 00:19:32,175
become Divine through Sahaja yoga, means 
Sahaja is not, sort of a, custody of few people,

136
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:41,074
it's for everyone because it is the right
of every human-being to become united with

137
00:19:41,074 --> 00:19:49,142
the Divine, to become Divine. Every human
being has this right to get this unity;

138
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:58,097
That's what sahaja yoga means, that is
spontaneously works within every human being

139
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:07,678
and you have to get to Divine. Now the 
problem may come later on with the word

140
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:22,154
yoga is, that when you become Divine how
will you know about. Then the second

141
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:30,589
meaning of yoga means deftness - kaushalam
- deftness, is the nearest word for that

142
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:38,474
is deftness. Deftness, how to handle the
Divine power. So far you have not handled it,

143
00:20:38,474 --> 00:20:44,777
you have not felt it, the All-Pervading Divine
Power but then when you have felt it,

144
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:53,882
the second stage will be, how to maneuver
that Divine Power. So, Sahaja yoga goes

145
00:20:53,882 --> 00:21:01,830
into two stages. First is the spontaneous
awakening of your Kundalini, which is the

146
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,882
triangular, which is settled in the 
triangular bone, as I told you yesterday

147
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:11,044
and I told you the names of the different
centers, which are subtle centers within us

148
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:21,317
and secondly, to know how to handle this
power that now you start feeling as cool

149
00:21:21,317 --> 00:21:32,578
breeze of the Holy Ghost. This Kundalini
is a force, which is residual within us -

150
00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:38,917
meaning, when the whole being is created
and now as we are human-beings, this is still

151
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:47,225
fully existing there. Our impure desires, 
that's why we do not get satisfied with them;

152
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:52,855
We jump from one to another but this is
the purest desire that is within us

153
00:21:53,713 --> 00:22:01,823
and this desire has to be awakened within
us so that we become one with the Divine Power.

154
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:09,137
As the Divine Power starts flowing within 
us, actually, we get connected with that

155
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:16,908
source of Divine Power within us or as if 
we get connected as this instrument is

156
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:25,781
connected to the mains. It is inexhaustible.
It flows, fills you up completely.

157
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:32,499
As a result of that, you get rid of all 
your physical, mental, emotional problems

158
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:43,488
most of them. All repairs take place. Cancer,
all diseases which are supposed to be incurable,

159
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:49,349
all kinds of incurable diseases can be
cured by Sahaja yog; You can cure them

160
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:57,972
once you become Divine. We have cured, no
doubt. If you want to know, you can find out.

161
00:23:00,387 --> 00:23:10,797
So many people have been cured and once 
you get that light of Truth within you,

162
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:17,266
you drop out all that is false, automatically
you drop out. I don't have to tell you,

163
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:21,926
"Don't do that, don't do that," nothing -
no Ten Commandments before realization

164
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:30,785
but after realization, you become a master
of yourself, just a master. All that is

165
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:38,905
falsehood falls off and that's what you
have to be. Once you are the Spirit,

166
00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:45,435
your Spirit is your master and the Spirit
starts guiding you. It sounds fantastic

167
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:51,503
but if you look at a amoeba, he was thinking
what a fantastic thing the human beings are!

168
00:23:53,443 --> 00:23:59,983
And why this fantastic human being is
created after all, is to be known that

169
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:09,203
fantastic thing that he is. But whatever is
unknown is not Divine that we must know.

170
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:15,627
Many things are unknown to us because if 
they come into awareness, they cause problems.

171
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:25,870
Our ears can hear only a particular type of
sounds but birds may hear something more

172
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:31,400
than us, which we have lost because for 
this human body it was not necessary

173
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,990
for us to know those things. So
many things we have lost

174
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:43,126
and so many we have gained just
to suit our this human being

175
00:24:43,346 --> 00:24:52,778
as it is and whatever we have to achieve, that
also we achieve in such a beautiful manner

176
00:24:54,117 --> 00:25:02,747
that all the problems that are existing within
us because of our ignorance, just vanish

177
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:10,917
like thin air. It's really magical but
whatever is unknown, is not Divine.

178
00:25:11,434 --> 00:25:19,084
Today I'm going to tell you about that part,
which is unknown to us and which part is Divine.

179
00:25:21,991 --> 00:25:28,911
Yesterday I told you, in short, about the
chakras, today I will tell you about the

180
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:36,127
channels that we have within us. The channel
we have on the left side, as you see,

181
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:43,898
is the channel, which is a subtle channel.
In the Sanskrit language it is called as the

182
00:25:43,898 --> 00:25:51,539
Ida Nadi or the Chandra Nadi or the, or the
channel of the moon. This manifests outside

183
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:56,561
the Left Sympathetic Nervous System. Now
in the Medical Science, they do not differentiate

184
00:25:56,561 --> 00:26:02,158
between the left and the right. I mean, they
haven't reached that state of subtle understanding

185
00:26:02,158 --> 00:26:07,681
so they are confused between the two. For
them left and right both are just the same

186
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:17,504
So the left side, which is the Ida Nadi,
is unknown to us, means, which is not in

187
00:26:17,504 --> 00:26:26,503
our awareness - we don't feel it - is the
past that we have, is the present past,

188
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:35,660
is the past past and is the past from where
we have come. All that is Collective past,

189
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:46,807
is beyond us, is unknown to us. Quite
recently I saw about a year back, a

190
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:57,365
very good broadcast about the cause of Cancer.
Of course, they reach somewhere near there.

191
00:26:57,675 --> 00:27:08,325
They said that the vulnerability of cancer
exists in everyone and everybody builds in

192
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:16,325
a cancer and dissolves it. We say that the
Sympathetic activity builds in cancer

193
00:27:16,573 --> 00:27:23,053
and the Parasympathetic neutralizes us,
according to Sahaja yog. But they also said

194
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:35,733
one thing very notable that, the cancer is
caused by triggering, by, they called them

195
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:41,187
Protein 58, Protein 52 - giving them some
names. You see, they don't know what to call it.

196
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:50,332
By those entities, which can be called as Protein
52, Protein 58 - they enter into our being

197
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:58,755
and trigger the cancer. Also they said, very
remarkably, that, "This attack comes to us

198
00:28:00,086 --> 00:28:08,446
from the area which is built within us 
since our creation." We call it as

199
00:28:08,446 --> 00:28:20,106
Collective Subconscious. They are very,
very near us. So, cancer is always caused

200
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:31,135
by an attack which triggers this disease and
this attack comes to us from the left side

201
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:42,184
called as the Collective Subconscious. So 
when we move too much to the left side,

202
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:51,040
we might get cancer but before that we
get experiences which we do not know.

203
00:28:52,752 --> 00:29:00,002
They are unknown but very dangerous.
Now what are the experience we get on the

204
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:10,921
left hand side is, that first people start
seeing their past. They find their bodies

205
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:20,289
are removed and they are flying somewhere
and they are left somewhere. Sometimes

206
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:25,061
they start seeing things which they
have never seen before.

207
00:29:27,175 --> 00:29:33,805
They can gradually start feeling a
kind of numbness in their brain

208
00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:41,937
by which they cannot understand
many things. Their memory

209
00:29:41,937 --> 00:29:47,885
is very good but they find they are very
lethargic, they cannot get up to do work.

210
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:55,139
They feel hopeless in life. The more they go
towards left - with so many things you can do it

211
00:29:55,139 --> 00:30:00,665
with certain types of drugs, you can
do it if you attend to some gurus,

212
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:06,525
by following certain methods which
are left-sided. All the methods of

213
00:30:06,525 --> 00:30:12,346
mesmerism can take you down there,
all the Spiritualists and all that,

214
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:18,977
even people who go to churches or into
temples, where people are mesmerized -

215
00:30:19,305 --> 00:30:24,925
even the temple people can mesmerize you.
In the church, if you are sitting on top

216
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:31,380
of the dead bodies, you might be mesmerized
- anything that is dead can cause it.

217
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:38,059
Say, you are living near a cemetry, in the 
night if you are going about after 12 0'clock

218
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:44,204
somewhere, maybe in the night you can be
possessed and the result of that, ultimately

219
00:30:44,204 --> 00:30:49,764
becomes very obvious that people just get
possessed in the beginning. Once they are

220
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:54,738
possessed, they start accepting that
possession and behave in a very strange

221
00:30:54,758 --> 00:31:00,798
manner for other people but they themselves
feel quite happy about it. It goes on moving

222
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:07,549
towards the left more and more - people 
can get epilepsy, people can get diseases,

223
00:31:08,004 --> 00:31:13,904
which can be called as Schizophrenic or
any psychological problems which doctors

224
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:21,304
cannot cure and the psychologists are also
trying to fumble at it because left side

225
00:31:21,304 --> 00:31:26,400
is the psyche, that's why I said, that Freud
was absolutely half-baked; He only knew about

226
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:35,392
the left side not about the right side. So, all
left-sided problems start coming to you.

227
00:31:35,392 --> 00:31:42,830
Recently I heard, about a disease called AIDS,
which has now gripping many people in America

228
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:49,121
and may grip people here - is also
another left-sided attack. Promiscuousness,

229
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:54,551
all these things are left-sided, are emotional
things. You run after emotional things

230
00:31:54,551 --> 00:32:00,634
and you go into the unknown and you're hit
there in your ignorance and then you don't realize,

231
00:32:00,634 --> 00:32:10,672
why, we were seekers? Yes, you have been
seekers for ages, no doubt but you did not

232
00:32:11,032 --> 00:32:20,292
use your common sense, your wisdom, what
you were doing. All those gurus who teach you

233
00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:24,731
that sex can take you to God and all this
nonsense, can take you to the left.

234
00:32:27,631 --> 00:32:33,331
All these funny ideas that they
give you, can take you to left.

235
00:32:33,906 --> 00:32:39,426
Then the right-sided are also there, so
many people who can do that kind of a thing

236
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:46,926
So, this is one unknown area, I've described
to you, is the Collective Subconscious.

237
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:53,721
On the right side is another channel,
called as the Pingla Nadi, is the Surya Nadi,

238
00:32:53,721 --> 00:33:01,976
is the channel of the Sun.

239
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:10,214
This is the channel of your action, of 
your creativity, of your future. Now those

240
00:33:10,214 --> 00:33:15,829
who are futuristic people, those who live
in the future, plan in the future because

241
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:24,574
future doesn't exist; What exists is the
present. The central path is of the present

242
00:33:25,281 --> 00:33:34,031
and the right sided one is that of the
future. So those who are futuristic people

243
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:42,062
they can be very austere, they can be
without any emotions, you see, specially,

244
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:48,322
say people nowadays, I find, are doing lot
of exercise, [UNCLEAR] even doing exercise

245
00:33:48,758 --> 00:33:56,748
They can just become like dried fish [UNCLEAR]
- not even a grain of emotion inside.

246
00:33:56,748 --> 00:34:01,877
So the one on left side, talk of love, "We
must have love and all that," the others,

247
00:34:01,877 --> 00:34:10,089
they say, "Disciplined, come along now like
military, wars, this, that," no compassion,

248
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:17,099
no love - talk of love is nonsense -
there's nothing like emotions, forget it.

249
00:34:18,445 --> 00:34:25,755
So, the right-sided people become
extremely strong-headed, very futuristic.

250
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:31,205
When they become futuristic, they can
even forget their names

251
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:34,390
- to that extent they can go; Their
past miss even their names.

252
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:37,948
I've known one gentleman, who forgot
even the name of his wife and she was

253
00:34:37,948 --> 00:34:42,620
crying and crying, "Just see, he forgets
my name. Every time I tell him, he forgets

254
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:46,971
I've been married with him for
30 years and now, just imagine, he's

255
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:50,949
forgetting my name. What a mess he's in!
He doesn't remember my name." He forgot

256
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:55,222
the name of his father, everyone but she
was very upset. She said, "The father is gone,

257
00:34:55,222 --> 00:35:00,009
he's now no more there to weep but I'm there to
face this thing that he doesn't even remember

258
00:35:00,009 --> 00:35:06,869
my name - he was that furturistic." He must
be remembering the name of his future wife

259
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:12,395
perhaps, the way he forgot. It is so
absurd a thing to be that futuristic

260
00:35:12,395 --> 00:35:19,359
because future doesn't exist but in the
presence if you, in the present you live

261
00:35:22,002 --> 00:35:29,202
then, you are with reality. Future
doesn't exist, the past is finished

262
00:35:29,678 --> 00:35:35,358
but if I tell you be in the present now,
to be, you cannot be - it's not possible.

263
00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:41,305
Either we are in the past or the future
and beyond the future is there is another

264
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:47,065
horrible realm that exists, which is 
called as the Collective Supraconscious.

265
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:59,004
This Collective Supra Conscious was used
by Hitler and many leaders can use this.

266
00:35:59,004 --> 00:36:03,684
You see, they'll frighten you, they'll tell
you that, "This is going to happen," or maybe

267
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:09,614
they might say that, "We are the highest
race," like Hitler said. And everything,

268
00:36:09,896 --> 00:36:16,416
you see, looks like that to people. So, 
the left-sided people are the people,

269
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:22,134
we call as the ones, which are having a
big superego or the Pineal body acting

270
00:36:22,134 --> 00:36:29,994
and the right-sided are the people, who
have too much of ego with the Pitutary acting.

271
00:36:31,342 --> 00:36:36,202
Both are equally just the same. The one,
who are left-sided, torture themselves.

272
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:42,799
They will starve, they'll put knives into 
their bodies, they'll put nails into their

273
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:53,291
nose or pierce pins into their faces, color
their heads. It's very dangerous to color

274
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:58,972
your head like that. I've known people
coming from that kind of thing - they're

275
00:36:58,972 --> 00:37:04,806
about to be blind; These pigments and
all that - one has to be very careful

276
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:11,696
but when it happens to them, then they come
- doesn't matter, still one can work it out

277
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:17,798
but the right-sided people are the ones,
who torture others, who overpower others.

278
00:37:18,858 --> 00:37:23,458
They think they are the right. They'll
convince you that they're right and you

279
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:32,826
will just be with them. They have a sharper
intelligence in a way which is not wisdom.

280
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:40,821
Because to have one person carrying the
whole load upon himself and taking all of

281
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:48,578
them into Hell or into a situation that
Hitler created for the Germans today.

282
00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:55,691
No one trusts Germans and the Germans are
so apologetic, you see, all the time, if you

283
00:37:55,691 --> 00:38:01,067
have been to Germany, specially to East
Berlin, you'll be surprised. They're so

284
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:05,566
apologetic. Oh, they say, "It was a 
political mistake, it was this mistake,"

285
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:15,819
all the time they're so apologetic. So, a
person who is right-sided, can also create

286
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:22,548
an aura, a kind of a big thing and people
can jump into that because it is unknown.

287
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:28,721
It was not known to Germans, what it was
to feel, that they were a special race

288
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:36,321
but do you know that Hitler used these
horrible Lamas to give him this power

289
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:41,650
to absolutely entice these people.

290
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,230
He tried all these tricks on them because
he learnt how to entice them;

291
00:38:53,938 --> 00:39:01,398
It's an established fact. So a person, if
he gets possessed by power, he can get

292
00:39:01,398 --> 00:39:09,856
you also possessed by it and you lose
complete control over your own understanding

293
00:39:11,627 --> 00:39:16,497
and no connection is there now with the
Whole - you don't think of the Whole.

294
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:26,470
A man, who is ego-oriented, acts on his
own and starts destroying others and

295
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:33,880
making others also the same way as he is.
Now, this realm of ego is not known to you

296
00:39:35,307 --> 00:39:44,167
and that realm, if it comes on you, you will
not recognize it. It gives you another type

297
00:39:44,678 --> 00:39:52,928
of physical diseases also like, heart
disease. If a person has a heart trouble -

298
00:39:54,688 --> 00:40:00,028
there are two types of heart troubles, according
to Sahaja yoga - one is a lethargic heart

299
00:40:00,028 --> 00:40:04,376
another is an over-active heart and
the treatment is just the opposite,

300
00:40:04,422 --> 00:40:09,432
while in the Medical Science, it's only
heart trouble, whether it is angina or

301
00:40:09,432 --> 00:40:14,338
whether it's coarctation of aorta and
pulmonary vein or anything it is, just the

302
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:20,040
same treatment they give to a patient.
There are two types of people - one who are

303
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,682
left-sided, one who are right-sided and
the third type of people, are the people

304
00:40:25,682 --> 00:40:33,971
who are in the center, who live in moderation
but in seeking you do move to the left and the right.

305
00:40:33,971 --> 00:40:40,671
In seeking you do move. If you are wise,
you keep in moderation in the center.

306
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:49,231
Tradition helps a lot, if you respect the
traditions. Not all the traditions are good

307
00:40:49,231 --> 00:40:56,551
but some traditions do come from the
Unconscious and the more you are prone

308
00:40:56,551 --> 00:41:00,346
to the Unconscious, the more
you are guided by it.

309
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:05,368
Simple-hearted people, village
folk, who are not so complicated,

310
00:41:05,368 --> 00:41:11,519
who don't use their mental projections
so much, are very much near it,

311
00:41:12,327 --> 00:41:18,807
very much near. They know who is an
Incarnation, they know who is a Divine person,

312
00:41:18,807 --> 00:41:30,575
they know who is fake but people
who are complicated,

313
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,819
find it difficult - there is a barrier

314
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:44,314
because they have lost that sensitivity,
because they have lost that feeling.

315

she's saying, so that's why she can't sit longer.

324
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:22,439
We can have some people tomorrow morning,
if you want. I can see them, if they're sick

325
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:28,005
or in London, if they can come, I can see
them but just now, I'm just trying to

326
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:33,763
create doctors out of you. You all become
doctors, so that you can treat yourself

327
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:43,580
and you can treat others - that's the best,
isn't it? So, My job is less. Now, with this

328
00:42:47,103 --> 00:42:56,493
that there is another awareness, which is here 
on top of our head, where we have to rise.

329
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:05,684
While, we can call it the Super Consciousness -
I mean, there are no words in modern language

330
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:14,605
but we can use super; Cambridge people would
say Supa - we can say Supa Consciousness here

331
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:24,455
and that consciousness, if the consciousness
we have to achieve and that's possible not

332
00:43:24,455 --> 00:43:30,664
through your mental projections or through
your education by anything but by the

333
00:43:30,664 --> 00:43:37,272
living process of Kundalini awakening,
which pierces through your fontanel bone.

334
00:43:39,828 --> 00:43:45,988
It removes all your, so called, artificial
identification, sophistication and all

335
00:43:45,988 --> 00:43:59,273
this nonsense and you become that pure
thing, your Spirit and that's what is this

336
00:43:59,273 --> 00:44:05,951
Super Consciousness, you have to achieve.
Then you become, again I will say, it is not

337
00:44:05,951 --> 00:44:12,971
just a brainwash - you become that and by
becoming, you get completely cured

338
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:26,077
of all these misidentifications, of all these 
wrong ideas because you become the Absolute.

339
00:44:26,077 --> 00:44:34,281
There is no more relative world left for
you; You know this is the Truth because

340
00:44:34,281 --> 00:44:42,588
once that becomes, becomes your own,
becoming becomes your own. You start

341
00:44:42,588 --> 00:44:50,422
feeling a new sensation of cool vibrations,
of cool breeze in your hand. First time

342
00:44:50,422 --> 00:44:55,966
you feel that Divine Power flowing through
you and you feel the cool breeze coming

343
00:44:55,966 --> 00:45:01,233
out of your head. This nobody can do;
Can any human-being do like that

344
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:07,159
to take out cool breeze? It starts coming
out of your head, you can see and it starts

345
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:14,699
coming out of your hands. Then, the second
stage has to be achieved in which you have to know

346
00:45:16,027 --> 00:45:22,767
the kaushalam, the deftness how to handle
this Divine Power which you have achieved.

347
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:42,270
This is a very vast subject because, so
far, whatever you have done, you have done

348
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:49,430
through your human awareness. Whether
you have accepted the knowledge of this tree

349
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:57,858
or the culture that we see or anything, also
that you have done through human awareness

350
00:45:58,529 --> 00:46:05,209
and whatever seeking you have done,
is also through your human awareness.

351
00:46:06,624 --> 00:46:12,884
You have to have the awareness of your
Spirit to go to the roots to understand

352
00:46:14,211 --> 00:46:19,111
the knowledge of the roots, the roots
that are nourishing this tree.

353
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:27,309
Whole economics, politics, everything that you
have outside, has deep roots within yourself.

354
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:31,910
Unless and until you understand those
deep roots, you will not understand the

355
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:36,549
oneness of the whole thing. An example 
I'll give you about politics now; There's

356
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:43,362
a big problem between Communism and 
Capitalism; They're all one, perhaps,

357
00:46:43,362 --> 00:46:49,528
you do not know. I would say, I'm one of
the greatest Capitalist because I have

358
00:46:49,528 --> 00:46:56,447
so many powers within Myself but I'm the
greatest Communist because I must share them.

359
00:46:56,678 --> 00:47:04,668
I can't live without sharing it. Both 
things meet when you have real power

360
00:47:04,668 --> 00:47:08,988
then only you can have real sharing.
This is all artificial sharing.

361
00:47:13,394 --> 00:47:19,044
That's why we have to achieve our real
power and learn the joy of sharing.

362
00:47:19,618 --> 00:47:26,158
You automatically become a Communist, if
you are a real Capitalist

363
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:35,573
and there is no problem and 
quarrel on that point.

364
00:47:36,612 --> 00:47:42,182
All knowledge of Economics is
superficial - why?

365
00:47:42,182 --> 00:47:54,834
because you talk about human-beings who
have desires or wants, as they call it;

366
00:47:54,834 --> 00:48:03,140
Want is the word. Wants which are satiable
in particular but not satiable in general.

367
00:48:05,224 --> 00:48:11,924
We talk of the want, which is satiable in
particular also in general.

368
00:48:14,376 --> 00:48:18,876
So the knowledge of Economics that you
have, is still on a shallow level.

369
00:48:18,928 --> 00:48:21,948
In the deeper level once you have this,

370
00:48:23,104 --> 00:48:27,334
then the satisfaction itself becomes
part and parcel of you.

371
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:40,111
There is nothing to be desired anymore.
First, you are facing a person or someone

372
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:46,490
to desire something from that person or
from that position from that chair or maybe

373
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:54,871
from that food or maybe from that house.
Now, it's the other way round - you give it back.

374
00:48:56,657 --> 00:49:00,947
You take from the Nature morning till
evening - you're exhausting the Nature;

375
00:49:01,127 --> 00:49:10,609
Now you give it to the Nature. How? If
you now give these vibrations to a tree

376
00:49:10,609 --> 00:49:18,758
which is dying, it will survive. We have
experimented, in India, in an agricultural

377
00:49:18,758 --> 00:49:27,758
college, with many professors there, that
if you give vibrated water to the land

378
00:49:28,891 --> 00:49:36,501
or which is irrigated by vibrated water,
you get ten times more the yield and

379
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:45,081
it's not like hybrid to taste - it's very 
nice to taste; The food is very nourishing

380
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:52,117
They have tried with Indian cows. If you give
them vibrations, the vibrated water to drink,

381
00:49:52,129 --> 00:50:00,059
they produce milk. Supposing, they were
producing, say, 4 litres or say 5 litres,

382
00:50:01,658 --> 00:50:09,628
they start producing something like 20 litres.
Maybe, an Australian cow may produce 25 litres

383
00:50:10,254 --> 00:50:16,374
but they'll produce in between, say 20
litres but the milk of an Australian cow

384
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:22,955
will make an Indian a vagabond. He'll be
very rude, he'll not respect anyone,

385
00:50:22,955 --> 00:50:28,592
he'll have no sense of respect - it's all
funny for us when the children start

386
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:34,234
taking that milk, you see. They hit you
back, they become boxers - all sorts of,

387
00:50:34,234 --> 00:50:40,368
you see, traits from Australia just crawl into
India, which are now we are not used to

388
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:46,000
but if you give this milk to an Australian
he becomes a sober person,

389
00:50:47,436 --> 00:50:51,646
he becomes a sweet person because
he comes in the center.

390
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:59,762
And Indians, who are all the time
frightened, worried, upset about money,

391
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:08,911
come in the center. So, it affects everyone.
To bringing left to the right, is not the way

392
00:51:08,911 --> 00:51:16,338
to improve but bringing left to the center
and right to the center and that's how,

393
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:24,431
you give back to the Nature whatever you
have achieved from the Nature you have got

394
00:51:24,431 --> 00:51:33,378
from the Nature, you give it back and 
that's only possible, if you become the

395
00:51:33,378 --> 00:51:41,705
real Capitalist to give back. The whole thing
becomes [UNCLEAR], the whole priorities change.

396
00:51:41,705 --> 00:51:48,406
As I told you yesterday, that an egg becomes
a bird. Now imagine, the similarity left

397
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:58,772
between an egg and a bird - just free to fly.
The first stage is, that you become a bird

398
00:51:58,772 --> 00:52:03,847
and the second stage is, you learn
how to fly and make others fly too.

399
00:52:06,404 --> 00:52:15,434
It is fantastic. To you it may appear to be
something very unusual but to Indians it is not.

400
00:52:15,434 --> 00:52:19,334
Those who are Indians; I mean, they are
Anglicized, Westernized, then I can't say,

401
00:52:19,334 --> 00:52:29,934
but those who know about this that we had 
since thousands of years this method of

402
00:52:29,934 --> 00:52:36,986
giving realization, was adopted. People were
given realization but very few, one or two.

403
00:52:37,816 --> 00:52:45,546
But today the time has come that thousands
of seekers are born and they have to be

404
00:52:45,546 --> 00:52:51,599
given realization and it has to work out 
enmasse; The time has come, that's why

405
00:52:51,599 --> 00:53:02,202
it is going to work out. So, I would
request you, that you should today ask

406
00:53:02,202 --> 00:53:09,000
for your realization and work it out and get
your realization. I'm here only for today,

407
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:18,260
I'm sorry to say, in Brighton but I'm not
very far. These days I'm in London.

408
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:26,337
Somehow, it was all organized that I had to
come to London and My husband got re-elected

409
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:36,181
three times unanimously and I hope this
time he won't ask for another election

410
00:53:36,181 --> 00:53:43,624
because it's time for Me to go back to India
and work there but two and a half years

411
00:53:43,624 --> 00:53:47,697
are still there for this term, so I'm 
there for two and a half years and you

412
00:53:47,697 --> 00:53:54,253
need only, I think at the most, two and a half days to be an expert, if you want to.

413
00:53:55,472 --> 00:54:00,312
Some people got realization in Louis and
today they are giving realizations to others.

414
00:54:00,935 --> 00:54:08,575
Only day before yesterday they got their
realization, so you don't need too much time.

415
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:17,964
Have you any questions, please?
I'll answer.

416
00:54:21,813 --> 00:54:24,773
If you have any questions, please ask.

417
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:33,339
Thank you!

418
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:49,553
Seeker - They have been [UNCLEAR] when You
tell this to put our hand on our hearts

419
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:54,162
and then here, we had to do this
sixteen times and say

420
00:54:54,162 --> 00:54:59,181
- Yeah, yeah
- "I'm not guilty," and You said You will explain, alright

421
00:54:59,181 --> 00:55:01,325
- Yeah. Why sixteen times
- You didn't say, You didn't explain

422
00:55:01,325 --> 00:55:08,053
Yes, I'll tell you. It's very simple. In our book
you will know that all these centers have got

423
00:55:08,355 --> 00:55:14,995
a number of petals - we call them petals
and this is a very important center

424
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:21,423
because by raising our head we have become
human beings. It has got sixteen petals

425
00:55:21,423 --> 00:55:30,653
and you'll be amazed that when in the
gross we see the cervical plexus, which is

426
00:55:30,653 --> 00:55:37,734
the gross manifestation of the subtle center,
that also had got sixteen sub-plexuses,

427
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:45,308
so we say it sixteen times that all the
petals could be treated. Actually,

428
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:50,111
eight times is sufficient for, if you are only 
suffering from the left side but I don't want

429
00:55:50,111 --> 00:55:55,125
to leave things to chances because the
way you people feel guilty, it is better

430
00:55:55,125 --> 00:56:00,329
you say it sixteen times - it's better - 
because it's a fashion these days to feel

431
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:04,736
guilty. For what people feel guilty, I just
don't understand; Is only the Western people -

432
00:56:04,746 --> 00:56:09,156
I've never heard Indian feeling guilty. I've
never heard. If they are not Westernized,

433
00:56:09,156 --> 00:56:13,546
they don't know also why to feel guilty
- for what? We have not murdered anyone.

434
00:56:20,569 --> 00:56:27,579
And if you are guilty, then the courts will
find it out. Why should we criticize ourselves

435
00:56:27,596 --> 00:56:32,286
to be guilty or anything and you are not
in the presence, so why should you feel guilty -

436
00:56:32,286 --> 00:56:37,229
for what? If you had done anything wrong,
you would have been arrested long time back.

437
00:56:41,163 --> 00:56:50,263
But in the law of God there is something
called as forgiveness and as He is the

438
00:56:50,263 --> 00:56:54,938
Ocean of forgiveness, He dissolves all 
these little, little things that you have done

439
00:56:54,938 --> 00:56:59,638
- you are children. Human-beings have to
make mistakes - after all they are not God

440
00:57:02,076 --> 00:57:07,456
So what is there to curse yourself or to feel
bad about it? That's why I said sixteen times

441
00:57:07,456 --> 00:57:11,954
otherwise eight times punishment is 
alright but I said sixteen times because

442
00:57:11,954 --> 00:57:15,005
here the people do it in a very
big way, that's why.

443
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:27,318
These are all different number of petals,
as you can see. The four for the first one

444
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:35,519
six for the second, then ten for the central
one, then twelve for that one - the heart,

445
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:43,371
the this one sixteen, this is two and then
thousand, thousand but we make it simple.

446
00:57:43,371 --> 00:57:47,982
There are seven centers in the Limbic area.
The seats of these seven centers is in the

447
00:57:47,982 --> 00:57:52,174
limbic area, so we just say seven times
for this.

448
00:58:03,392 --> 00:58:04,912
We should..... yes?

449
00:58:04,912 --> 00:58:10,219
Seeker - We have to get realization. I've
come here for realization [UNCLEAR]

450
00:58:11,225 --> 00:58:16,485
What does he say? Please repeat it.

451
00:58:16,485 --> 00:58:19,852
Seeker - I've come to get realization,
I haven't yet.

452
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:23,790
- He says coming here realization, Mother.
- Annh?

453
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:29,425
- May he have realization, please.
- That's the best. That's the best thing

454
00:58:29,425 --> 00:58:34,193
- that you've asked for. Yes!
- How do I get it?

455
00:58:34,193 --> 00:58:41,502
Yes, that's what I am just waiting to see.
That's great! That's a very good thing to say.

456
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:51,686
Yes, you'll have it. Alright? It's very simple now.
Must believe that it has to be simple - one thing.

457
00:58:51,876 --> 00:58:55,963
That I've told you at length that it
has to be simple thing.

458
00:58:57,718 --> 00:59:04,138
Only thing, that All-Pervading Power is
here, everywhere but we cannot feel it.

459
00:59:04,138 --> 00:59:08,991
You see, like a radio can only catch the
ether in the same way it is.

460
00:59:08,991 --> 00:59:13,791
It's very simple. Now what you
have to do, is to put your feet

461
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:18,743
on the Mother Earth. Why? Because
She helps us. She helps us a lot.

462
00:59:18,743 --> 00:59:22,305
Take out your shoes, will be better to
give you some connection with all these

463
00:59:22,305 --> 00:59:26,670
artificial things, I don't know, but still
let's start. So, better take out your shoes

464
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:30,305
it will help and also, when you take
out your shoes, there's a little

465
00:59:30,305 --> 00:59:34,475
relaxation to your feet, you see. Just
take out your shoes like that

466
00:59:34,475 --> 00:59:41,354
and put your both the feet straight like
that and your hands like this.

467
00:59:41,354 --> 00:59:48,095
Why don't you do it? It's very simple.
Yes, it's very simple. It helps

468
01:00:02,427 --> 01:00:08,437
Now, as I told you yesterday and
today again I tell you that these hands,

469
01:00:08,437 --> 01:00:13,842
here shown in a bigger way you can see,
these from the color you can see that

470
01:00:13,842 --> 01:00:21,582
these fingers are the manifestation of
the centers which are sleeping here.

471
01:00:23,131 --> 01:00:30,201
Now these are five, six and seven on the left
hand side and these are five, six and seven

472
01:00:30,201 --> 01:00:34,538
on the right hand side, so these centers
when joined like this, say, now this is

473
01:00:34,538 --> 01:00:39,929
the spinal cord. In the center you can
see here, is the spinal cord.

474
01:00:41,651 --> 01:00:46,091
So the left and right join and that's
how a center is formed.

475
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:53,170
Now these centers are represented
on your fingers.

476
01:00:53,321 --> 01:00:56,771
As I told you yesterday, Muhammad
Sahab has clearly said that,

477
01:00:56,771 --> 01:01:04,133
"At the time of resurrection your hands
will speak." He has talked more about the

478
01:01:04,133 --> 01:01:11,287
time of resurrection than the time of 
doomsday - really! But those who read

479
01:01:11,287 --> 01:01:15,932
Koran, never talk of resurrection - they
think they're already resurrected

480
01:01:18,189 --> 01:01:21,709
but they talk of the doomsday because
everybody should be frightened of the

481
01:01:21,709 --> 01:01:28,147
doomsday, you see, so they all cling to
these mullahs or to the priests or to the

482
01:01:28,286 --> 01:01:34,496
pundits and all these people but they don't
talk of the resurrection day, which is

483
01:01:34,496 --> 01:01:41,913
at length is so much vividly, clearly described.
Now, so these hands that you have,

484
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:47,373
you don't think much of them, perhaps but
they are very great. You have to just

485
01:01:47,373 --> 01:01:52,617
spread your hands, like this, in a very
simple way, put them on your lap and

486
01:01:52,617 --> 01:01:56,670
be comfortable - that's important. There
should be no nothing uncomfortable

487
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:02,270
about it. Just put your hands, place
like this. Just place like this

488
01:02:05,229 --> 01:02:10,109
and close your eyes. Before closing your
eyes you can take out your spectacles

489
01:02:10,109 --> 01:02:18,833
because spectacles will little bit be
disturbing as the eyes also gets cured.

490
01:02:19,115 --> 01:02:25,785
Eyes also get vibrations so better to give
a greater chance to your eyes it's better

491
01:02:25,785 --> 01:02:30,253
to remove your spectacles and close your
eyes; You don't have to open your eyes

492
01:02:30,253 --> 01:02:34,725
because when the Kundalini is rising like
that and She comes up to this center,

493
01:02:34,725 --> 01:02:42,292
that time if your eyes are not closed, She
may fall down and some of it may not even

494
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:46,875
rise at all. So some of you may not have
the awakening, so better is to take out

495
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:52,981
the spectacles also. If there's anything
tight here, you can little bit loosen.

496
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:57,111
I mean, if it is very tight but if it's
not very tight, it's alright, as long as

497
01:02:57,111 --> 01:03:04,296
you are comfortable. Here also sometimes
we have little tightness also you can loosen it.

498
01:03:04,742 --> 01:03:10,532
Now, you have come here to gain the
maximum advantage and so you have to

499
01:03:10,532 --> 01:03:15,065
co-operate a little bit with us. So just,
you take out your shoes, take out your

500
01:03:15,065 --> 01:03:21,826
spectacles, take out your, I mean, I 
also take out your tooths and nails

501
01:03:21,826 --> 01:03:27,372
and keep your eyes shut but if you don't
want to do it, no use being here, you see,

502
01:03:27,372 --> 01:03:30,676
just why to be here. Like, the other day,
two people came, they said,

503
01:03:30,676 --> 01:03:34,621
"We are observers, you see." I said,
"Are you international observers here?"

504
01:03:34,621 --> 01:03:40,300
Here you have come to be, so better get
something. What are you going to observe?

505
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:44,052
You are not even a realized soul,
what are you going to observe?

506
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:50,557
Do you think, [UNCLEAR], I think, that you 
have come to observe here? What will you observe?

507
01:03:50,795 --> 01:03:55,335
Everything is going to work out within
yourself. Why don't you guide yourself

508
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:01,230
with this greatness? So please, try to
put your hands straight, close your eyes.

509
01:04:02,787 --> 01:04:08,597
Any observers, please, I will request you
to go away because it's a waste of time

510
01:04:08,597 --> 01:04:14,561
for us and for all. So why? If you have some free
time, you can go to some beautiful garden

511
01:04:14,561 --> 01:04:20,133
and enjoy yourself. Please close your eyes.
Just put your hands straight, just like that

512
01:04:21,146 --> 01:04:30,856
and nothing more to be done for the time
being. Don't fix your attention anywhere

513
01:04:30,856 --> 01:04:36,982
and don't worry if there are thoughts coming
in you. Just make your attention very loose,

514
01:04:36,982 --> 01:04:41,412
in the sense that you just don't worry about
what thoughts are coming; You just watch

515
01:04:41,412 --> 01:04:45,284
your thoughts, that's all and don't pay 
any attention to them. They're coming and

516
01:04:45,284 --> 01:04:54,740
going - that's all. Put your hands 
straight towards Me, on your lap with your

517
01:04:54,740 --> 01:05:00,089
fingers open towards Me - just like that,
straight - that's all, with your fingers

518
01:05:00,089 --> 01:05:02,840
little bent towards Me, that's all.

519
01:05:14,562 --> 01:05:19,002
Why don't you close your eyes?
Please close your eyes.

520
01:05:21,294 --> 01:05:23,924
There's no harm in closing your eyes.

521
01:05:24,732 --> 01:05:27,452
If you don't want to do it, it's
better you go away.

522
01:05:31,239 --> 01:05:38,469
Now as the left side is the desire power,
we have to keep it fixed - the desire;

523
01:05:38,645 --> 01:05:42,725
Desire to be one with the Divine
- left side.

524
01:05:42,725 --> 01:05:48,955
That is, the left hand is to be fixed as it
is, on your lap - as is as simple as that

525
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:59,480
and with the right hand we have to do
the action. Is very simple action is,

526
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:05,655
that you put your right hand on 
your heart, just on the heart.

527
01:06:07,339 --> 01:06:23,229
Now, in the heart resides the Spirit. At 
this stage, in your heart, you have to

528
01:06:24,417 --> 01:06:32,437
ask a question to Me, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" 
You are that but you better ask the question

529
01:06:32,437 --> 01:06:37,731
because still you are not sure, so you just
ask the question, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

530
01:06:37,731 --> 01:06:41,564
As an answer to that, the Spirit may be
awakened within.

531
01:06:42,683 --> 01:06:46,083
"Am I the Spirit? Am I the Atma?"
