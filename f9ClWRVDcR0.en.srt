1
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,367
It would be better if you are

2
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:58,048
All right

3
00:05:22,747 --> 00:05:29,997
We are here we all understand English do you all the people who are reporters English?

4
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:35,817
We are here

5
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:38,997
To inform you about

6
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:42,987
a power

7
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:46,168
Which is within us?

8
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:48,987
and the power that

9
00:05:50,737 --> 00:05:57,987
Can give you what is promised by all the same scriptures and all the incarnations

10
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:06,087
Today when you see the young people in every country specially in the West

11
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:13,527
You'll find they are not satisfied

12
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:18,027
With their own atmosphere

13
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,778
Their lives

14
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,597
And they think there is something missing

15
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,367
And they are extremely confused

16
00:06:41,778 --> 00:06:43,807
Now when they are confused

17
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:47,947
They are seeking for something beyond

18
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:51,788
Something unknown to them

19
00:06:55,098 --> 00:07:00,967
In that seeking they may take to anything extreme

20
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:12,847
Drugs could be alcoholism

21
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:25,658
Or some other perversions, which cause horrible diseases incurable diseases

22
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,928
Instead of condemning them

23
00:07:45,618 --> 00:07:48,067
We have to see why they are doing all these things

24
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:52,148
What is the purpose

25
00:08:00,217 --> 00:08:03,417
Also some of them went to some gurus

26
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:10,227
Which are in the market

27
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,737
Especially when they see the religious people and the religions

28
00:08:26,097 --> 00:08:32,777
They cannot believe that religion can give such horrid experiences

29
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:47,298
And some of them are anti-god anti-religion also

30
00:08:58,358 --> 00:09:05,307
But if you deal with the problem sympathetically you cannot blame them because they are intelligent

31
00:09:06,907 --> 00:09:08,907
Aware people

32
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:28,388
So now we have to category of people one the ones who are not seeking at all

33
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:39,567
And another are the once

34
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:45,958
Who want to find out solutions of the problems

35
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:58,967
In every generation

36
00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:03,117
We had people who revolutionized

37
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:11,787
Because they did not like a particular system or did not like a particular style of life, whatever it was

38
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,207
But now the revolution has to come from within

39
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:23,727
We have to evolve from within

40
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:40,738
Because the destruction is also coming from within

41
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:45,717
We are destroying ourselves more from within

42
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:51,208
Because we are so unhappy so confused

43
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:58,287
Absolutely quite a percentage is schizophrenic

44
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:06,898
So then we start seeking this solution

45
00:11:08,498 --> 00:11:12,447
And in that seeking we make mistakes

46
00:11:22,337 --> 00:11:28,037
And we make mistakes because we do not know what to seek

47
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:37,437
And how to find

48
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:44,897
Also how to evolve to that state

49
00:11:55,518 --> 00:11:57,637
So logically we have to reach

50
00:11:59,028 --> 00:12:01,028
some conclusions logically

51
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:04,927
That it has to be some

52
00:12:05,928 --> 00:12:07,308
evolutionary

53
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:09,018
happening

54
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:11,018
This is logical to

55
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:13,037
transform ourselves

56
00:12:13,037 --> 00:12:15,577
There has to be some evolution

57
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:24,948
You was not an Austrian magic

58
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:34,798
Freud was invited

59
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:39,478
All right, so like you have said that

60
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:42,808
You have to become

61
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:48,447
Collectively conscious you have to become it's an actualization. It is not just a certificate

62
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:52,617
It has to be come from within it's an honest thing

63
00:12:53,318 --> 00:12:55,177
It's an innate thing

64
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:57,177
It is not just a preaching

65
00:12:57,367 --> 00:13:01,917
Or sort of a giving a certificate it is not or taking a name

66
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:07,347
It is actualization within yourself so

67
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:14,367
That something has to happen to us

68
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:24,718
Now as we have evolved from monkey stage to this stage for example

69
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,518
You've done nothing it is a living process

70
00:13:37,297 --> 00:13:39,297
Which has taken place spontaneously

71
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:56,078
There's a big resistance

72
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:01,418
To any

73
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:04,938
Oriental ideas

74
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:06,938
being accepted in the West

75
00:14:07,518 --> 00:14:09,518
wick resistance I

76
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:13,777
Find there's a very big resistance for any oriental ideas

77
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:21,908
Coming to the West

78
00:14:30,657 --> 00:14:34,276
Now these oriental ideas which are coming

79
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,277
Are to be seen with a scientific open mind

80
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:57,207
Because the Western life has grown like a tree outside

81
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,827
But the roots may be in the East

82
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:12,598
Maybe we can keep ourselves open to see we're at the roots

83
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:29,868
Now if the roots are in the East supposing it's an hypothesis

84
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:35,778
So let us have a look at it. If there is any solution in those

85
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,757
So you go to oriental, I guess

86
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:45,287
But there also, it's very dangerous

87
00:15:46,768 --> 00:15:53,507
Because you are going in the unknown you might go to false guru. You might go to wrong people

88
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,688
And get completely destroyed

89
00:16:01,558 --> 00:16:02,728
So

90
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,678
What do we do?

91
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:09,347
First thing we should know we cannot pay for our evolution

92
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:12,617
We cannot pay money is not there

93
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:31,197
Nor can we pay for any living process any living process we cannot be

94
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:41,067
Like if the seat has to sprout the mother earth is sprouted we don't pay the mother earth

95
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:50,038
All right so first thing they should have known that anybody who asks for money

96
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:56,787
Is not a truthful person no money should be known

97
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:06,867
Then the second point comes in that we got to this stage of human awareness

98
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,708
Spontaneously

99
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:14,938
Without any effort effortlessly

100
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:22,868
In the same way it should happen

101
00:17:31,838 --> 00:17:35,998
But first of all in every evolution there has been one leader

102
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:52,718
We can call them as archetypes as they say or whatever you may say want to say

103
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,617
So you was not very clear on that point

104
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:04,147
So now such a person can decode

105
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,417
the information

106
00:18:08,117 --> 00:18:09,498
Of

107
00:18:09,498 --> 00:18:12,068
symbols and everything and

108
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:18,218
Can help others without taking any money without taking any gratification?

109
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:24,367
Can do it and here it is

110
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,287
That people fumble in the West

111
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:32,648
They don't mind a pope

112
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:35,437
They don't mind an RPF of canterbury

113
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:41,527
But they do mind a person who is doing everything free just out of love

114
00:18:49,237 --> 00:18:56,877
You'd be amazed in England the television people told me that we cannot accept anything which does not take money

115
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:01,737
Can you believe it he's a fact

116
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:11,607
In I think in Boston or somewhere they asked me a question how many Rolls Royces you have got

117
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,778
This is

118
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:23,067
And in San Francisco, they would not even publish my advertisement

119
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:27,387
Because by mistakes we had said that it can cure AIDS

120
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:34,677
They said no we don't want AIDS to be cured. We don't want anything to deal with our homosexuality

121
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:38,967
They said that horrible things that

122
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:42,058
65 percent people are

123
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,098
homosexuals in San Francisco and

124
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,977
the editor if he's a homosexual

125
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,628
and the

126
00:19:49,628 --> 00:19:52,018
Chairman is even the Mary's

127
00:19:53,018 --> 00:19:55,018
so I didn't know what to do I

128
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:59,098
Thought it better not to advertise because we will be useless for them

129
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,208
This is the problem is

130
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:09,778
Then the most important thing which is not realized by modern mind

131
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:16,017
That they believe anything new is to be tried

132
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:19,558
Is a very dangerous thing

133
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:41,837
If we are dealing with the living process of evolution we have to know

134
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,107
That

135
00:20:46,107 --> 00:20:47,398
in

136
00:20:47,398 --> 00:20:49,078
spiritual life

137
00:20:49,078 --> 00:20:51,078
Whatever is going to happen

138
00:20:51,357 --> 00:20:56,297
Must relate to scriptures to all the Scriptures must relate

139
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:20,887
Not to one scripture say for Holy Bible or Holy Quran or any but to all of them

140
00:21:25,638 --> 00:21:27,638
Because it is like a seed that

141
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,378
sprouts

142
00:21:30,378 --> 00:21:32,378
Then it becomes

143
00:21:32,628 --> 00:21:34,578
the stem

144
00:21:34,578 --> 00:21:36,578
then the branches

145
00:21:36,978 --> 00:21:38,978
then the leaves

146
00:21:39,168 --> 00:21:45,818
Then the flower and then the fruit living process it is based on something

147
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:54,788
Evolves through something, but whatever is dead like we can create a fruit plastic fruit from nowhere. Just like that is you

148
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:58,058
So which has no basis?

149
00:22:04,688 --> 00:22:12,208
Has no meaning it must have a basis from where it has come its origin must be seen

150
00:22:29,188 --> 00:22:31,188
As in the growth of the

151
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:32,488
tree

152
00:22:32,488 --> 00:22:38,807
all that is useless drops out in the same way in evolution also all that is useless drops are

153
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:43,157
Even useless tradition drop out everything drops out but ultimately

154
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:45,767
You reach to the epitome

155
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:48,078
Where you become the fruit?

156
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:59,858
So the time has come for human beings to become the spirit

157
00:23:15,338 --> 00:23:17,338
What's the white cotton

158
00:23:23,257 --> 00:23:25,257
Fabric

159
00:23:25,418 --> 00:23:30,537
So every seed has memory alright and

160
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:36,327
In the same way within us is our Camry is the Kundalini

161
00:23:51,968 --> 00:23:56,108
And this is to be actually awakened actually awakened

162
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:13,337
Of course the superficial people who are not worried about the world will not bother about

163
00:24:13,948 --> 00:24:18,198
Their out of question superficial people, but there are another kind

164
00:24:19,138 --> 00:24:21,467
Who is making money in the name of?

165
00:24:22,648 --> 00:24:24,648
spirit

166
00:24:24,658 --> 00:24:28,967
Or living on that money and organizing

167
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:39,778
We'll definitely oppose us

168
00:24:41,377 --> 00:24:45,177
Naturally we become controversial for them because the basically we'll use them

169
00:24:46,688 --> 00:24:51,297
For no fault of ours we don't mean too much it just happens along

170
00:24:53,528 --> 00:24:55,528
But a person who has

171
00:24:57,188 --> 00:24:59,188
Pure intelligence

172
00:24:59,588 --> 00:25:06,598
You need not be a very well-educated person nothing but pure intelligence can see through the game

173
00:25:08,737 --> 00:25:10,797
Should be able to see through the game

174
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:27,388
Now in sahaja yoga, we have

175
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:30,058
thousands of people all over the world

176
00:25:30,848 --> 00:25:34,768
There are people who are we can call them the highest in the society?

177
00:25:35,138 --> 00:25:39,327
There are people who are the lowest in the so-called society?

178
00:25:40,508 --> 00:25:42,508
all of them are

179
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:50,997
At par with each and every person there is no higher lower feeling

180
00:25:53,348 --> 00:25:59,067
Everyone belongs to that society and so it belongs to that society

181
00:26:04,748 --> 00:26:06,458
Moreover

182
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,458
when this happens

183
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:11,008
Because we understand

184
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:14,337
What these incarnations where?

185
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:18,388
The conflict of

186
00:26:18,518 --> 00:26:20,518
All religions drops out like that

187
00:26:20,948 --> 00:26:24,898
We understand it on central nervous system the conflict drops out

188
00:26:25,568 --> 00:26:29,638
There is no question of not worshiping Christ

189
00:26:30,638 --> 00:26:32,757
Muslims Jews Hindus

190
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:35,398
all worship Christ

191
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:40,887
They all worship Muhammad SAW, and they all worship Rama, Krishna

192
00:26:42,638 --> 00:26:43,958
Because

193
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:45,958
Actually, they see that

194
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:50,878
when the Kundalini Rises she passes through certain centers and

195
00:26:51,638 --> 00:26:55,557
There you have to take the name of those great

196
00:26:56,288 --> 00:26:57,848
incarnations

197
00:26:57,848 --> 00:27:00,238
so this is the knowledge of the roots and

198
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:04,287
one must know that you have to become a subtler being

199
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:07,048
to understand that knowledge

200
00:27:07,778 --> 00:27:10,347
But unless and until we have that knowledge

201
00:27:13,418 --> 00:27:19,557
We are in for a catastrophic there's a big shock awaiting us

202
00:27:21,698 --> 00:27:24,248
And how are we going to avert it?

203
00:27:28,908 --> 00:27:32,168
Just by talking about peace you don't bring peace

204
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:37,958
Those who talk about peace they don't have peace within themselves

205
00:27:57,348 --> 00:28:01,057
So we are at that point we try

206
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:06,337
To talk about tell about it persuade people

207
00:28:07,668 --> 00:28:12,037
And media can help us it has helped us a lot in Italy

208
00:28:14,298 --> 00:28:19,688
And also in India of course because in India people know they have the knowledge of the route

209
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:22,958
So it's very easy in the villages of India

210
00:28:23,628 --> 00:28:26,198
Even in the cities of India's we are

211
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:30,458
Doing very well not only that but

212
00:28:31,368 --> 00:28:36,337
say for example Delhi University has accepted sahaja yoga for research and

213
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:43,718
The degree you get is a Doctor of Medicine higher than post graduation after post graduation

214
00:28:44,118 --> 00:28:47,107
You get this degree is very rare Doctor of Medicine

215
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:54,517
For sahaja yoga, they have accepted even Cambridge University has accepted this for a result

216
00:28:55,308 --> 00:28:58,088
So once you try to see the sense in it

217
00:29:02,688 --> 00:29:05,917
Not they have not done it to criticize him, but with respect

218
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:12,397
Not to criticize it but with respect with acceptance that there is something about

219
00:29:16,227 --> 00:29:21,316
So I would request the media to give the facts

220
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:27,017
By understanding it you have nothing to gain

221
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:30,567
But

222
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:33,557
Austrian people should be benefited. That's all

223
00:29:34,497 --> 00:29:39,437
As a result of Kundalini awakening it can claim many things

224
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,946
But that can be seen that

225
00:29:45,178 --> 00:29:49,127
Cancer can be cured so many incurable physical diseases can be cured

226
00:29:50,487 --> 00:29:52,487
mental diseases can be cured

227
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:55,457
Drug addiction can be cured

228
00:29:57,117 --> 00:29:59,117
The problems created

229
00:30:01,377 --> 00:30:03,377
By these gurus can be cured

230
00:30:07,048 --> 00:30:11,027
All these things can be done when you become the spirit

231
00:30:11,668 --> 00:30:14,477
But this should be just at a level

232
00:30:15,507 --> 00:30:17,507
of a hypothesis

233
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:21,946
When we do it, and it's proof, then you should accept not blindly

234
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,587
There is no blind faith in sahaja, yoga

235
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:31,637
We have no priest roots nobody is paid

236
00:30:34,408 --> 00:30:36,408
It's a free society

237
00:30:46,938 --> 00:30:49,748
And everyone becomes very knowledgeable

238
00:31:00,718 --> 00:31:04,468
A sahaja yogi, may not be a doctor, but he can cure people

239
00:31:05,978 --> 00:31:09,297
He may not be a sec artist, but he can keep your mad people

240
00:31:11,318 --> 00:31:13,318
He becomes equipped

241
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:16,167
With the power by which he does it

242
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,958
like Christ was not a

243
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,008
doctor

244
00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:23,008
Sure people in

245
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:26,638
The same way in the same fashion

246
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:35,907
Now I would like you to ask me questions because it's a very wide subject and one can go on talking about it

247
00:31:35,908 --> 00:31:42,688
I wanted these people to explain to you for 15 minutes all other things so that you will have your questions ready for me

248
00:32:10,647 --> 00:32:15,016
Any other you've said in the literature any unauthorized tampering

249
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,306
Can harm in some way your yoga?

250
00:32:20,337 --> 00:32:22,337
How do you explain this unauthorized?

251
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:26,627
Anthony tampering interference written by sahaja Yogi's you see the language is

252
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:35,446
Probably people who try to awaken the Kundalini of course of course you

253
00:32:36,658 --> 00:32:39,918
See the Kundalini can only be awakened

254
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:42,798
by a person who has the authority

255
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,357
divine authority

256
00:32:45,357 --> 00:32:52,306
You cannot elect a person you see like we can elect a priest. It's not like that. You must have the power

257
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:55,168
to raise the Kundalini

258
00:32:55,168 --> 00:32:57,287
Now those people who are leading already

259
00:32:58,497 --> 00:33:02,836
But you can say every in one word dirty life. You can see

260
00:33:05,427 --> 00:33:07,427
Cannot raise the Kundalini

261
00:33:08,158 --> 00:33:12,677
you have to belong to this pure religion inner pure religion and

262
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,158
You have to have these powers

263
00:33:27,568 --> 00:33:33,767
Otherwise those people who try other tricks what they do they disturb your sympathetic nervous system

264
00:33:34,647 --> 00:33:36,178
activated

265
00:33:36,178 --> 00:33:38,098
Kundalini doesn't rise

266
00:33:38,098 --> 00:33:40,098
Kundalini will only rise

267
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:42,088
by a

268
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:44,088
proper sahaja yogi

269
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,608
For example I'll tell you

270
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,948
Supposing there is a seed

271
00:33:56,938 --> 00:34:00,047
And you want to plant it

272
00:34:06,188 --> 00:34:09,208
So you have to put it in the mother art

273
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:12,208
Supposing you put it on this table it won't

274
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:15,867
But supposing you put it in the fire it will burn

275
00:34:18,998 --> 00:34:21,477
Only the mother earth has the power to sprout

276
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:30,208
That's what it is all right. I mean when you give communique Muslim is clear-cut all stuff. It's but I wouldn't understand myself

277
00:34:31,118 --> 00:34:33,118
I'm sorry for that

278
00:34:37,478 --> 00:34:40,197
What else these a lot of homework, I must say

279
00:34:41,618 --> 00:34:43,618
It's great

280
00:34:43,778 --> 00:34:45,098
and

281
00:34:45,098 --> 00:34:47,098
That's why you must have read

282
00:34:47,408 --> 00:34:51,717
There were some books in German also about Kundalini horrible books

283
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:56,997
That it harms you will burn chewed nothing of the kind it does not

284
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:03,478
It is the sympathetic when activated by wrong type of things like sex

285
00:35:04,778 --> 00:35:07,257
activations another the activation some people

286
00:35:07,628 --> 00:35:13,617
Try to turn this out and all that and you start seeing the light and all that thing. This is not short-circuiting

287
00:35:15,038 --> 00:35:17,038
Actually you suffer a lot with that

288
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:21,807
It's a spontaneous it just happens to be spontaneously

289
00:35:35,908 --> 00:35:39,748
Are you feeling relaxed yourself you got it

290
00:35:41,468 --> 00:35:43,468
You've got your realization

291
00:35:45,158 --> 00:35:47,458
Only thing you have to little bit know about it. That's all

292
00:35:48,788 --> 00:35:50,788
absolutely relax this or thought

293
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,978
You got it

294
00:35:56,978 --> 00:35:58,478
You got it

295
00:35:58,478 --> 00:36:04,677
just while talking to me you got it because you are a positive person want to know about if you come with a

296
00:36:05,858 --> 00:36:09,027
Determined effort just to criticize then nothing can work out is it

297
00:36:09,757 --> 00:36:11,757
It's nothing's got it

298
00:36:12,158 --> 00:36:14,158
You got it

299
00:36:14,978 --> 00:36:16,978
May God bless you

300
00:36:18,998 --> 00:36:22,287
It's your own I've done nothing I was just talking to you

301
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:28,047
Kundalini knows that you are sitting before me she just rolls by herself. That's your mother

302
00:36:29,408 --> 00:36:32,668
That's your mother your own indeed your mother

303
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:37,498
That's the Holy Ghost that's the primordial mother

304
00:36:38,978 --> 00:36:43,797
Which Christians don't talk about and then they don't want you to know anything else?

305
00:36:44,198 --> 00:36:47,157
whatever they will teach you should learn nothing more I

306
00:36:48,128 --> 00:36:50,547
Was myself born in a Christian family?

307
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:58,107
So you have to have you see blinkers on both the sides you're not supposed to see this fight work that side

308
00:36:58,838 --> 00:37:02,517
And this is why young people fell a trap

309
00:37:03,158 --> 00:37:06,478
To these horrible gurus who came to make money here I?

310
00:37:07,598 --> 00:37:09,687
know of somebody who came from jail

311
00:37:10,748 --> 00:37:12,748
Who came to Germany?

312
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:16,378
wearing those saffron clothes sat on one of the

313
00:37:17,678 --> 00:37:22,678
Centers there somewhere and a relief rock to him he came from jail

314
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:30,038
Because you don't know

315
00:37:30,038 --> 00:37:32,128
how to make out a good

316
00:37:33,158 --> 00:37:38,758
Guru the sub guru and the a guru is there are books and books on that come India

317
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:41,368
but they don't know four things and

318
00:37:42,158 --> 00:37:48,538
I don't blame them because they were seeking seeking so honestly that they got into trouble

319
00:37:49,238 --> 00:37:51,297
But I have been talking about them from

320
00:37:52,028 --> 00:37:54,028
1974

321
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:57,958
But the underworld

322
00:37:58,388 --> 00:38:04,018
Another problem was with young people from the West was that they hated Christianity

323
00:38:04,118 --> 00:38:08,818
That's one problem so when I talked about Christ they just under went back

324
00:38:09,728 --> 00:38:11,728
You can talk to them

325
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:15,718
They said don't talk of Christ they went out

326
00:38:17,738 --> 00:38:23,818
So this Christianity has done nothing but a harm to them that they just don't want to hear about Christ

327
00:38:24,308 --> 00:38:27,357
Which Christ is a living God no doubt?

328
00:38:29,108 --> 00:38:31,258
And I have to talk about him very much

329
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:36,838
But they didn't like it. It's such a problem of

330
00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:40,688
Conceptions

331
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:45,328
Conceptions see reality is what reality is is not a concept

332
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:51,328
This is what it is see Christ is the son of God. He is the real

333
00:38:52,148 --> 00:38:54,098
personality whatever

334
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:58,828
Church may do to eat or anyway do to it makes no difference he is what he is

335
00:38:59,348 --> 00:39:01,438
And this is the problem is the concept?

336
00:39:02,528 --> 00:39:04,528
Concept is not reality

337
00:39:04,628 --> 00:39:06,628
that's just a mental prediction just

338
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:10,318
a mental projection

339
00:39:11,698 --> 00:39:13,698
You have to rise beyond that

340
00:39:14,128 --> 00:39:16,128
to be the spirit

341
00:39:16,258 --> 00:39:17,728
All right

342
00:39:17,728 --> 00:39:19,937
We got this nano your name, please

343
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:23,358
your name, please

344
00:39:25,288 --> 00:39:27,288
George

345
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:31,578
Is the name of an angel

346
00:39:33,508 --> 00:39:35,508
Yes st. George and st

347
00:39:36,868 --> 00:39:44,327
George we call him as Bhairava in our Indian language. He's called as head of a st. George

348
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:48,318
Very great God

349
00:39:48,628 --> 00:39:50,628
accordion

350
00:39:57,788 --> 00:40:01,977
So we have nobody else now here Steve you have any questions

351
00:40:03,788 --> 00:40:07,558
Now must be because you see you're a two-faced journalist, what about you?

352
00:40:28,078 --> 00:40:32,747
Where has this message can spread in the world - which country

353
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,468
It's now 16 countries

354
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:47,717
There are thousands of people in about six of those countries

355
00:40:55,498 --> 00:40:57,768
Of course of course we

356
00:40:58,618 --> 00:41:01,517
Have here actual RCZ was in the Islam religion

357
00:41:02,248 --> 00:41:04,248
from, Algeria

358
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:09,348
Then of course you know him very well, and here only you'll find people from different

359
00:41:10,078 --> 00:41:12,078
religions sitting here

360
00:41:13,648 --> 00:41:18,017
There's a lady from a Hindu religion there sitting and

361
00:41:19,348 --> 00:41:22,638
What was your religion? Maybe she?

362
00:41:25,078 --> 00:41:27,078
Born again

363
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:35,118
You self-certified God again, I thought no, that's same thing guys

364
00:41:35,968 --> 00:41:37,588
All right

365
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:43,848
So of course no doubt we have an all religions all caste or creed like Sierra

366
00:41:44,398 --> 00:41:46,607
Leone now we have got the Africans there

367
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:49,427
There we have got

368
00:41:49,947 --> 00:41:56,597
Spain we have gotten even into Bolivia. Will you be eyes what is that religion therefore?

369
00:41:59,638 --> 00:42:04,127
Only we have a kind Bolivia and also in

370
00:42:06,058 --> 00:42:08,058
Now in Peru everywhere

371
00:42:08,998 --> 00:42:10,468
so

372
00:42:10,468 --> 00:42:17,238
It is infinite it goes to everyone it cannot be see even God is one how can you have?

373
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:20,308
anybody barred

374
00:42:20,308 --> 00:42:22,308
we have Chinese and

375
00:42:22,408 --> 00:42:28,577
We have Japanese all types of people we have from all races from everywhere, so there's no question

376
00:42:29,348 --> 00:42:31,348
what is

377
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:36,477
But actually I cannot give the list of all the nations, but practically all except for Scandinavian

378
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:44,097
Nations we have not approved, but we have Scandinavian people in sahaja yoga, but we have not yet established centers

379
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:09,868
So many people were there

380
00:43:14,738 --> 00:43:21,358
See I think Italians are great sensitive people

381
00:43:22,687 --> 00:43:24,687
Italians are very sensitive and

382
00:43:25,418 --> 00:43:33,087
You will be surprised in Italy there are no gurus except in the north of Italy. They are very sensitive very emotional and sensitive and

383
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,558
they respect love and they have respect for mother all and

384
00:43:38,197 --> 00:43:43,737
When they saw my photograph they did feel something about it. I don't know what they felt about my photograph

385
00:43:43,738 --> 00:43:47,398
I don't know what photograph. It was but they felt peace maybe

386
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:50,008
Whatever it is

387
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:55,378
But I was amazed the whole hall was filled with me absolutely and

388
00:43:56,558 --> 00:44:00,418
Italians even as far as the government is concerned

389
00:44:01,868 --> 00:44:04,257
All of them are very open to sahaja, yoga

390
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:11,787
Surprising they're very sensitive people, and they must have found out about me that I have done all good

391
00:44:13,207 --> 00:44:20,907
There's no objection to anything and now they have invited me to a press conference which we do. I will tell you what it is

392
00:44:21,427 --> 00:44:29,427
It is a press conference of all the people of Italy it's a very big thing called as the press conference

393
00:44:30,308 --> 00:44:32,308
guest of the Year mother most of the

394
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:49,958
Talking to all of them

395
00:44:51,378 --> 00:44:56,107
Will be nice be nice really nice meeting them all yes

396
00:44:56,958 --> 00:45:01,958
But I feel Austria is one country which is very much in the center somehow

397
00:45:03,288 --> 00:45:06,757
It's very much in the center Austrians are neither East nor West

398
00:45:07,518 --> 00:45:12,278
Centipede and they are very good for sahaja yoga, very sensible people in Austria

399
00:45:13,818 --> 00:45:21,277
And we have found very sensible people in Austria no doubt about it another thing is Austria has never given us any

400
00:45:21,558 --> 00:45:23,298
problem

401
00:45:23,298 --> 00:45:25,298
We never got people who were

402
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:30,998
schizophrenic or nonsensical or fighting types nothing very nice people did want

403
00:45:31,638 --> 00:45:33,638
surprising

404
00:45:33,678 --> 00:45:37,188
So Austria has a special place. I think in Europe

405
00:45:58,638 --> 00:46:05,257
It's very you know they are very heavy, and you're put very small means there so what happens

406
00:46:12,288 --> 00:46:14,288
If they don't get it

407
00:46:15,138 --> 00:46:17,138
What if they get it

408
00:46:18,648 --> 00:46:24,097
Some people get the Kundalini raise some don't what happens to people after death if they don't

409
00:46:39,768 --> 00:46:45,038
Religions work on a concept that you do it our way, or you end up in a horrible place

410
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:49,808
No, it's not like that

411
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:52,208
You see I think

412
00:46:52,338 --> 00:46:54,338
most of the people should get it

413
00:46:55,248 --> 00:46:57,248
to get a very generous

414
00:46:57,528 --> 00:47:00,128
We work the whole thing as the world is today

415
00:47:00,888 --> 00:47:05,917
It will be taken by people they have take to realization. I'm sure

416
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:12,847
Most of them will get it supposing if they don't get and die then there will be born again, and they'll get it

417
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:20,408
But those work to go to hell will go to hell in any way

418
00:47:21,288 --> 00:47:22,698
in any way

419
00:47:22,698 --> 00:47:25,748
You see there there. There are people as used

420
00:47:25,748 --> 00:47:32,648
I would say who would never take to anything good would be there could be people I have not known

421
00:47:32,648 --> 00:47:35,467
But maybe we should give all the benefit of doubt

422
00:47:43,298 --> 00:47:45,328
Yes because you see

423
00:47:46,448 --> 00:47:52,047
Yes, that is it now. I'll tell you what happens that your spirit is absolutely. It's absolute

424
00:47:52,988 --> 00:47:55,017
Spirit is an absolute thing

425
00:47:55,598 --> 00:47:56,128
supposing now

426
00:47:56,128 --> 00:47:58,888
You want to know whether I'm good or not?

427
00:47:58,888 --> 00:48:00,278
Or he's good or not

428
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:05,608
The good is not the way we look at things like you see we see the dress in the face

429
00:48:05,608 --> 00:48:10,708
This is not looking superficially, but when we have to see person is good or not we see

430
00:48:11,528 --> 00:48:13,528
We feel his chakras

431
00:48:13,988 --> 00:48:20,637
What chakras he's catching you can feel them on your fingertips you see like Muhammad Sawa said that your hands will be speaking

432
00:48:20,918 --> 00:48:24,178
So you feed on your centers than other person?

433
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:30,688
So we don't certify them as good or bad that category doesn't exist in sahaja yoga, what we say

434
00:48:30,688 --> 00:48:32,907
What are the centers catching in a person?

435
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:40,888
Now what is catching in a person? What centers are wrong? We try to correct it?

436
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:47,037
We like it. We can say a patient comes to a hospital the doctors

437
00:48:47,038 --> 00:48:51,328
Don't say you have good or bad. They don't categorize like that what they seem

438
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:56,458
What is the disease let us treat that it's like so the good and bad?

439
00:48:57,338 --> 00:49:03,958
Is not described in sahaja yoga, what is described at the centers which are out of place?

440
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:11,158
But some people have ruined their centers completely have no Kundalini at all with them

441
00:49:11,158 --> 00:49:16,198
They are like devil some of them must have been I don't want to name them, but could have been

442
00:49:16,808 --> 00:49:24,537
So this is such people then what to do. They must have designer. I mean you cannot force anyone. That's the big problem

443
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:31,287
If they desire it well and put if they don't desire it you cannot just make them do it no you cannot

444
00:49:31,748 --> 00:49:34,227
They have to desire it in their own freedom

445
00:49:35,948 --> 00:49:37,948
Then they get it the joy

446
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:45,197
Nothing can be forced. This is the handicapped

447
00:49:53,387 --> 00:50:00,667
So we have don't know category we don't condemn anyone as bad, or we do not elevate somebody as excellent, but

448
00:50:01,308 --> 00:50:05,828
We tell them what are the center sketching and when you get your realization

449
00:50:05,828 --> 00:50:09,397
You will know what sketching in you and you will also know. What is catching in him

450
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:12,277
And then if I tell you supposing I if I tell him

451
00:50:13,008 --> 00:50:19,808
Dr. Warren your other sketching means your ego is coming up. He won't feel bad because he'll get a headache there

452
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,808
They said better correct it mother

453
00:50:22,788 --> 00:50:26,197
Which is ego will get a headache a little bit Surratt corrected?

454
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:28,867
so nobody feels bad about

455
00:50:29,657 --> 00:50:35,467
It so there is nothing like good and bad are words used very vague. They are very weak terminologies

456
00:50:35,627 --> 00:50:40,087
This is not procedure about it because fear it is absolute so

457
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:43,477
Everything related to spirit is the absolute knowledge?

458
00:50:45,197 --> 00:50:47,197
You may say a person is very good

459
00:50:47,718 --> 00:50:52,147
This is an excellent person that we don't accept what we accept is

460
00:50:52,147 --> 00:50:55,927
What are the condition of his chakras are and how much we can help?

461
00:51:00,468 --> 00:51:05,887
That's not we not bothered about who's good who's bad that category doesn't exist that

462
00:51:06,528 --> 00:51:10,568
Type of a category, but of course the condition of the chakras are varying

463
00:51:23,408 --> 00:51:27,208
Any other question Steve. You better ask me. He's an American I

464
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:35,068
Describe it

465
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:41,397
I never had it so how much

466
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:45,568
I'm born like this but

467
00:51:47,258 --> 00:51:52,798
I would say the experience of self-realization that I have seen that happens to people first of all

468
00:51:53,618 --> 00:51:59,128
When the kundalini rises you see of course the mechanism goes into complete force?

469
00:52:00,098 --> 00:52:02,098
and

470
00:52:02,558 --> 00:52:05,577
When she pierces through the fontanel bone area

471
00:52:06,518 --> 00:52:08,518
first thing you feel is the

472
00:52:09,068 --> 00:52:10,478
cool breeze in the hands

473
00:52:10,478 --> 00:52:17,548
But not necessarily some people feel it on top of their heads coming out a cool breeze from their head own head

474
00:52:17,948 --> 00:52:25,498
So the self-certification is there you see the cool breeze, but could be some people have too much heat coming out see supposing

475
00:52:25,498 --> 00:52:27,498
It's a cancer patient especially

476
00:52:27,968 --> 00:52:33,778
Or anybody like that to see this patient you find that a heat comes out

477
00:52:35,198 --> 00:52:38,127
Supposing it's a person. Who is very much possessed and

478
00:52:39,158 --> 00:52:41,218
extremely unhappy type of person maybe

479
00:52:41,888 --> 00:52:47,638
Or an open person whatever it is the Kundalini you can see clearly with your own eyes

480
00:52:47,888 --> 00:52:52,678
It's pulsating at different centers, but especially at the base of

481
00:52:53,408 --> 00:52:56,248
the spine will be called as the

482
00:52:57,728 --> 00:52:59,408
sacrum

483
00:52:59,408 --> 00:53:00,698
sacrum

484
00:53:00,698 --> 00:53:06,748
Sacrum is sacred both and the sacred book so you can see it very clearly we have got photographs of that absolute

485
00:53:06,968 --> 00:53:08,968
Pulsation you can see like a heart

486
00:53:10,118 --> 00:53:13,258
Then they experience moves with some people it does

487
00:53:13,258 --> 00:53:19,377
I must say they do feel the rising if it is slow rise, but if it shoots off

488
00:53:19,378 --> 00:53:22,528
You don't feel anything you just feel the cool breeze coming out of your head

489
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:26,668
Then you start feeling out of your fingertips

490
00:53:27,868 --> 00:53:30,587
But the feeling you get first of all

491
00:53:31,498 --> 00:53:34,848
When heat rises about this Center you feel?

492
00:53:36,178 --> 00:53:40,157
You're beyond, thought. You are in the present. We are not

493
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:44,778
Just enjoying the peace peace of your being

494
00:53:45,508 --> 00:53:47,538
enjoying yourself in the way and

495
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:52,007
Then when it pierces through a kind of a

496
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:57,737
Joy that trickles it out in different different people have different

497
00:53:58,378 --> 00:54:03,407
But say for Indians you see they don't think so much as you think you people think think think think too much

498
00:54:03,778 --> 00:54:07,128
So they don't think so they get there first of all they get the joy

499
00:54:08,668 --> 00:54:10,728
But in the West I think the people who get

500
00:54:11,398 --> 00:54:16,608
More the awareness about it. They start feeling his chakras is chakras

501
00:54:16,608 --> 00:54:21,767
They practice these that ultimately they get the gist, but Indians first get the joy they said

502
00:54:25,318 --> 00:54:30,947
It depends on the condition of a person what the experience would be but on the whole

503
00:54:31,228 --> 00:54:38,358
This one thing happens to all of you that your eyes start listening. They said listen. There's a twinkle in the eye

504
00:54:40,078 --> 00:54:42,078
That's one

505
00:54:43,498 --> 00:54:46,217
And their face becomes to see relaxed

506
00:54:46,858 --> 00:54:50,207
The wrinkles drop out you drop out sometimes ten years

507
00:54:50,878 --> 00:54:54,618
like see my aged 64 years of age -

508
00:54:55,888 --> 00:55:02,868
But people can't believe it because you see I don't feel my age at all. I'm we all have forgotten what our ages are and

509
00:55:04,138 --> 00:55:08,958
This is what happens to you because you go in a state of existence only

510
00:55:09,688 --> 00:55:11,688
But takes little time

511
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:18,437
Gradually to grow into it, but it starts with the sprouting of this seed that is the Kundalini

512
00:55:20,098 --> 00:55:24,497
But experiences people have different like in your case. It was very deep I know

513
00:55:26,638 --> 00:55:32,988
Because he was a great seeker, and he has started a band without knowing the word surge on his own Siraj bad

514
00:55:32,988 --> 00:55:36,887
I don't know how he started. He must have got it from the unconscious really

515
00:55:40,748 --> 00:55:42,748
And he had such a strong

516
00:55:44,438 --> 00:55:51,237
Experience because after that I met him for about five minutes, and then he went away to master and from Boston

517
00:55:51,238 --> 00:55:54,748
He sent me a telegram that mother we are waiting for you in Boston

518
00:55:55,388 --> 00:55:59,757
They said mother who is this one. I said he Steve I know him very well. I'm going down

519
00:56:00,488 --> 00:56:03,957
And they were surprised they said how will you recognize you've seen him only for five minutes?

520
00:56:03,957 --> 00:56:07,227
I said I recognize him don't you worry I'm going down there

521
00:56:08,558 --> 00:56:14,368
So you see all I can feel that also myself it in myself the person who's got it like I told you that

522
00:56:16,268 --> 00:56:20,128
It's in a part of the collective is the collectively part

523
00:56:23,258 --> 00:56:27,778
Because of collective consciousness you can feel another person and you can feel yourself

524
00:56:29,348 --> 00:56:33,267
But he's an experienced on your central nervous system is the thing

525
00:56:34,508 --> 00:56:41,217
But when you get joy, and when you get your awareness, it's a thing depending on the condition of yourself

526
00:56:42,788 --> 00:56:47,697
Mostly the West people first become aware you're aware they start seeing things better

527
00:56:48,457 --> 00:56:55,137
Those who have never noticed say for example a very nice curtain is lying here, but people will come see superficially go away

528
00:56:55,328 --> 00:57:01,828
But the sahaja yogi will see what a nice curtain what a nice pattern? What nice flowers what nice you see

529
00:57:02,738 --> 00:57:05,278
Penetration into everything it starts feeling everything

530
00:57:06,278 --> 00:57:09,058
Penetration is but experiences are different and different

531
00:57:09,788 --> 00:57:12,148
like I think everybody must write about

532
00:57:16,178 --> 00:57:18,657
Other a question that many people ask

533
00:57:19,568 --> 00:57:24,297
At such conferences is this is why in the past was it so easy?

534
00:57:25,088 --> 00:57:28,047
And so difficult, sorry, and why today, it's so easy

535
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:34,408
That's not embarrassing to ask me

536
00:57:38,168 --> 00:57:41,367
But one should reach a conclusion there must be something about me

537
00:57:41,648 --> 00:57:45,688
That I do it that easily all right one point our second point could be

538
00:57:46,238 --> 00:57:48,238
explained with an analogy

539
00:57:48,338 --> 00:57:52,348
That in the beginning there are very few flower flowers on a tree

540
00:57:54,038 --> 00:57:56,038
Very few one or two

541
00:57:57,128 --> 00:58:03,928
Then when tree comes up in age and plus sometime starts as thousands so the time has come

542
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:08,487
The time has come and I have come maybe that two things put together

543
00:58:10,298 --> 00:58:14,037
But maybe I know the trick of the trade better perhaps

544
00:58:18,068 --> 00:58:23,097
This is what I have discovered is our mas realization not individual, but

545
00:58:23,858 --> 00:58:25,178
Alma's

546
00:58:25,178 --> 00:58:29,188
That's what I have discovered if you want me to proclaim. I will proclaim that

547
00:58:30,128 --> 00:58:31,358
but

548
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:33,038
There's nothing

549
00:58:33,038 --> 00:58:35,038
Great about it I think

550
00:58:36,428 --> 00:58:39,357
Because if you have something what is so great I?

551
00:58:41,978 --> 00:58:43,978
Am achieved nothing you have achieved

552
00:58:46,088 --> 00:58:51,898
That's the point is you have a dyad this with me you have achieved a

553
00:58:55,478 --> 00:58:58,318
Channel you must ask me some questions he say he's a barrister

554
00:59:36,128 --> 00:59:38,128
Miss lane miss lane

555
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:45,208
How they form different different, that's a good point now you see inside why you get into the essence of everything?

556
00:59:45,908 --> 00:59:48,117
Say if you get to the essence of the three

557
00:59:49,268 --> 00:59:53,788
The easels or the SAP of the tree goes to every flower

558
00:59:56,558 --> 00:59:58,558
It doesn't discriminate

559
00:59:59,348 --> 01:00:01,348
But flowers are different

560
01:00:02,588 --> 01:00:10,438
Now what these people have done, they have plucked these flowers like somebody says this is my religion. This is pluck the flower

561
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:16,708
Then the flowers are dead now, so they are carrying on with dead flowers the religions are dead now

562
01:00:19,088 --> 01:00:21,718
But they are flowering on the same tree and

563
01:00:22,568 --> 01:00:29,698
You get inside the SAP through the root, so you see that everything is the same. It's just a manifestation of the same

564
01:00:30,398 --> 01:00:34,978
Now electricity is flowing it is giving you there. It is giving you a air conditioning

565
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:39,117
It is working out there, but electricity is the same because you become the essence

566
01:00:41,348 --> 01:00:43,797
But when you see from outside they look different

567
01:00:47,438 --> 01:00:54,747
Especially when deliberately they have plucked out these flowers and established, this is mine Christ is mine how?

568
01:00:58,778 --> 01:01:00,778
Islam is mine how?

569
01:01:03,498 --> 01:01:10,808
It is not you cannot have them as properties they cannot be your property

570
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:16,308
So this is what you realize

571
01:01:16,308 --> 01:01:22,688
And that's why you see that everything has the same you see because now you have become aneesa's new eyes have opened out you see

572
01:01:22,688 --> 01:01:25,747
That everything is the same you cannot become a fanatic now you cannot

573
01:01:27,918 --> 01:01:29,918
Even if you try to be

574
01:01:32,328 --> 01:01:36,787
It just cannot become fanatic anymore because you see the essence is the same I

575
01:01:38,478 --> 01:01:43,298
Mean shoe got put into this you got put into that sugar put into that if you become the sugar you are

576
01:01:43,428 --> 01:01:45,428
Everything isn't it I?

577
01:01:46,008 --> 01:01:51,788
Mean religion had to be little different in its form because of the times that were there

578
01:01:52,368 --> 01:01:56,557
Times where this way that way you see every time they had to change the outward

579
01:01:56,658 --> 01:02:01,957
Form and things like that on social level and political level this that but he says was the same

580
01:02:16,368 --> 01:02:19,478
Of course you can't have it anymore

581
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:28,117
That's very true because you see the essence is the same how can you see fanaticism comes from what finite we should say

582
01:02:29,478 --> 01:02:32,288
When you go into infinity how can you have fanaticism?

583
01:02:34,848 --> 01:02:41,647
You finite yourselves, I am these are these that is clubbing actually it is nothing but ordinary clubbing see

584
01:02:42,348 --> 01:02:46,057
we have clubs like somebody puts the say the

585
01:02:46,368 --> 01:02:51,458
Table where on the left side is one a club they put it on the right side another

586
01:02:51,828 --> 01:02:55,207
They distribute you see this is just like stupid clubbing that sorts

587
01:02:55,488 --> 01:03:03,397
You cannot club outcry God or Christ or any one of these incarnations? They are all brothers and sisters and relations of each other

588
01:03:07,188 --> 01:03:09,188
They are all related Legion

589
01:03:12,868 --> 01:03:14,958
But those people who were in charge

590
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:23,988
Try to destroy them as soon as possible I take the charge

591
01:03:26,668 --> 01:03:31,668
Christ Lee for four years how moments are believed. You know every one of them how they were tortured

592
01:03:32,188 --> 01:03:33,838
That's what happened

593
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:36,108
Because they wanted to take advantage of that

594
01:03:39,238 --> 01:03:41,268
But forgive them now all right

595
01:03:47,488 --> 01:03:49,877
Any other question from you yes, yes

596
01:04:02,158 --> 01:04:04,158
Hungry should we approach?

597
01:04:04,348 --> 01:04:11,358
Seekers in these countries, which are not free such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia and in a way they're better off I did

598
01:04:12,418 --> 01:04:14,418
I've been to Russia

599
01:04:15,448 --> 01:04:17,448
I know they are not free

600
01:04:17,548 --> 01:04:19,727
But you see when freedom is

601
01:04:20,098 --> 01:04:26,538
One one should be able to very quickly see what is happening to the free countries today. If you see that warrant

602
01:04:27,898 --> 01:04:29,728
If you go to America

603
01:04:29,728 --> 01:04:33,437
You can't wear your watch. You can't wear your bangles. You can't wear anything

604
01:04:34,578 --> 01:04:36,828
Maybe tomorrow they'll pull out your hair also

605
01:04:38,848 --> 01:04:44,178
It's such a chaotic country so this freedom also human beings cannot be in a way

606
01:04:44,998 --> 01:04:50,477
As far as other these free countries are I tell you the people are so simple I?

607
01:04:50,998 --> 01:04:54,258
Went to China I went to Russia because of my husband's job

608
01:04:54,258 --> 01:04:58,217
I where all people are extremely simple the governments are not at all, right

609
01:04:59,668 --> 01:05:06,258
But it will take no time for you to ignite. No actually it is already gone in a way

610
01:05:10,548 --> 01:05:13,177
Logically they are understanding it now that sahaja yoga it

611
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:19,658
So it will come through Russia it will come through China from these bigger countries

612
01:05:21,348 --> 01:05:24,727
But what about the free countries first of all tell me about them

613
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,237
Free it's a license

614
01:05:43,308 --> 01:05:49,207
Because we will have people of that quality what we need is a transformation of human beings

615
01:05:50,207 --> 01:05:53,977
Hypocrites talk of big big things cannot achieve anything isn't it?

616
01:05:54,947 --> 01:05:58,686
But the people who believe not believe but no as

617
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:02,888
An actual thing that we are part and parcel of the whole

618
01:06:03,378 --> 01:06:09,427
Will not think of one government another government will think of one world the world

619
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:16,478
All these so-called politics is because we are divided the nose is fighting guys eyes is fighting the years

620
01:06:17,028 --> 01:06:19,838
When they discover we are one body what is there to find?

621
01:06:21,828 --> 01:06:27,277
So most of the politics will be dissolved completely as it is now see look at us

622
01:06:28,427 --> 01:06:30,167
We have powers

623
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:35,197
So we are capitalists, and we want to give it to others so we have communists already

624
01:06:38,238 --> 01:06:41,138
If you want to carry we don't want to conserve it

625
01:06:42,437 --> 01:06:44,437
So we are already

626
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:48,007
Doing the right thing the integration

627
01:06:48,677 --> 01:06:56,137
So all these problems come out of human beings and as soon as they become the spirit the problems will be dissolved

628
01:06:58,638 --> 01:07:05,857
Social problems see we have already solved so many social problems in sahaja yoga. We don't have problems what you normally see

629
01:07:06,528 --> 01:07:10,927
Our children are great our marriages are great. We are enjoying our lives

630
01:07:11,628 --> 01:07:13,628
It's heavenly

631
01:07:17,748 --> 01:07:21,457
One or two mishaps are there doesn't matter but mostly

632
01:07:25,038 --> 01:07:31,987
We have a beautiful society no quarrel no jealousies no Fighting's no malice no hair trade nothing

633
01:07:36,618 --> 01:07:44,587
Isn't it great to have such a society and no dictation nothing absolutely free

634
01:07:51,228 --> 01:07:53,837
I know Mary. What did you want to ask?

635
01:08:13,588 --> 01:08:15,388
Why is it that people

636
01:08:15,388 --> 01:08:18,438
Are missing the chance they read the poster?

637
01:08:18,438 --> 01:08:23,448
and they walk by it happened to me in 82 I saw your poster I

638
01:08:42,178 --> 01:08:44,538
See people are some are very superficial

639
01:08:46,108 --> 01:08:48,108
Something known of themselves

640
01:08:48,148 --> 01:08:54,648
They think they don't need anything all kinds of things that I know I agree with you, but it happens yes, please

641
01:09:09,177 --> 01:09:11,177
What're you

642
01:09:11,728 --> 01:09:15,078
Saying that the advertising by the sahaja Yogi's

643
01:09:15,628 --> 01:09:21,167
For this program sounds a bit like an ad for instant coffee. He thinks it is instant coffee

644
01:09:24,868 --> 01:09:26,868
But he's saying that

645
01:09:27,088 --> 01:09:32,567
CI tell you, but I tell you we buy instant coffee isn't it now in modern times everything is done

646
01:09:32,608 --> 01:09:34,608
so we had to have instant you about

647
01:09:35,518 --> 01:09:37,078
It is what to do

648
01:09:37,078 --> 01:09:41,898
It is but you see now we can say that you can get it after a lot of sufferings

649
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:48,227
And you have to sacrifice the same sacrifice that all right, but it's not true now what?

650
01:09:48,838 --> 01:09:55,517
It is instant coffee, but we take instant coffee. We want everything instant in this modern time why not yoga

651
01:10:21,808 --> 01:10:23,808
So you tell us now how to advertise

652
01:10:25,918 --> 01:10:30,678
Yeah, you see what I'm saying that that's a fact. I really did it. That's a fact

653
01:10:31,738 --> 01:10:38,897
That's a fact the Kundalini. I call it a jet Kundalini in modern times really I'm myself surprised that it's working

654
01:10:39,628 --> 01:10:41,628
Just shoot wrong Oh

655
01:10:42,118 --> 01:10:44,357
thousands of people in India thousands

656
01:10:45,298 --> 01:10:47,218
See just shoot shuttle

657
01:10:47,218 --> 01:10:49,397
What am I to do it works like that?

658
01:10:49,398 --> 01:10:56,117
It's just I think the divine is anxious that let's have it down like that. It is in modern times. It's working very fast

659
01:10:56,728 --> 01:11:02,927
Not only me ask him how many people he has given realization every one of them have given to thousands

660
01:11:03,628 --> 01:11:06,587
realization I mean it seeing is believing but

661
01:11:07,828 --> 01:11:12,918
Advertising we do not know what to say now. What is it written here now?

662
01:11:13,648 --> 01:11:18,827
Perhaps thinks it's I don't know the English where it might be it's a little slick. It's a little smart, but

663
01:11:19,348 --> 01:11:20,368
or

664
01:11:20,368 --> 01:11:25,368
Something like that perhaps you mean more profound. Do you do you mean more deep more?

665
01:11:41,108 --> 01:11:44,698
Sounding like the other gurus that come I don't know about observables what they write

666
01:11:44,698 --> 01:11:48,087
But why don't you see tweet what you should write? I have no idea but

667
01:12:00,218 --> 01:12:06,447
What should we see what should we say here and now is a fact I tell you we need

668
01:12:11,048 --> 01:12:13,048
Now we can what should we say?

669
01:12:16,387 --> 01:12:18,387
All right

670
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:25,527
But what I am saying for people to be attractive what is saying that when you have to attract people from outside

671
01:12:26,617 --> 01:12:28,617
then we should put

672
01:12:31,387 --> 01:12:34,017
Try to change it, I don't know what

673
01:12:38,468 --> 01:12:39,767
I

674
01:12:39,767 --> 01:12:43,717
Think perhaps implied in Mary's question was is there a time?

675
01:12:43,847 --> 01:12:47,347
Is there a certain stage when you come to Santiago?

676
01:12:47,347 --> 01:12:51,877
Or is it that everybody should be brought in right now?

677
01:12:52,458 --> 01:12:56,227
Do you reach a stage in your awareness where you're ready for it?

678
01:12:56,227 --> 01:13:03,007
Or is it something that you just come if the advertising department is good is it worth?

679
01:13:05,508 --> 01:13:09,608
You just I don't know what what what to say on this point because you

680
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:15,337
Cannot say certainly that people have to reach a certain stage because a person you see

681
01:13:15,468 --> 01:13:18,097
His wife brought her saying that he's the worst man

682
01:13:18,648 --> 01:13:22,987
He indulges in to this indulge us into that and all kinds of things bad

683
01:13:23,177 --> 01:13:26,317
Certificates about that fellow and as soon as he came in he got his realization

684
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:31,447
You see the really true IT

685
01:13:32,477 --> 01:13:35,587
People suffering from cancer got realization in no time

686
01:13:37,128 --> 01:13:42,067
So what is the stage I don't know, but maybe we can say the

687
01:13:45,798 --> 01:13:47,947
Attitude towards life maybe

688
01:13:50,088 --> 01:13:53,737
That's to towards life is you see say for example in the West

689
01:13:54,318 --> 01:14:00,487
like these BBC people telling me that if you say that it is without money nobody will listen to

690
01:14:01,218 --> 01:14:07,508
When I cannot say it is for money, that's one part. He said when you say free admission

691
01:14:08,658 --> 01:14:10,658
Things is useless

692
01:14:11,868 --> 01:14:16,988
The conditioning is so bad that if the free admission oh must be something funny

693
01:14:19,338 --> 01:14:21,338
This is what?

694
01:14:22,128 --> 01:14:28,597
Anglo-saxons brain cannot understand anything without money, can you imagine he told me frankly you said do you change this?

695
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:32,378
I said well. What should I say I don't take really you don't take any money what am I to say?

696
01:14:32,378 --> 01:14:37,567
This is what it is you see is the conditioning of the mind, but in in English is not so

697
01:14:39,287 --> 01:14:47,047
In India if you see from the villages they'll come on bullet cards, they'll have miles together they'll walk when they will know I'm going

698
01:14:51,128 --> 01:14:53,128
Also the knowledge is not here

699
01:14:53,768 --> 01:14:56,157
They don't have no background what I would say

700
01:14:57,038 --> 01:15:04,767
My background is needed, and I don't know the sensitivity is needed for Italians did not have the background, but sensitivity is their

701
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:13,768
Worst reason I would say in Switzerland or America is the worst of all

702
01:15:14,558 --> 01:15:18,808
America fell for all kinds of guru because for sahaja yoga zero very bad

703
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:23,728
I'm sorry what it is. They don't look at sahaja yoga now

704
01:15:23,738 --> 01:15:28,288
They are after they have had all the experience of all the guru shopping

705
01:15:28,288 --> 01:15:34,317
They did now they're coming they want to do shopping. You know it's a fashion guru is a fashion

706
01:15:35,168 --> 01:15:37,168
It's nothing deep it's a fashion

707
01:15:37,598 --> 01:15:43,318
Going to this guru that will do that guru so how to talk to them they have money they want to shop it

708
01:15:45,218 --> 01:15:47,818
How many cover the worst of all I must say

709
01:15:49,088 --> 01:15:56,578
Experience wise supposed to be the most advanced most free country. They have the worst of all

710
01:15:58,958 --> 01:16:01,768
But in Austria I've seen the Falls are filled

711
01:16:02,738 --> 01:16:04,358
They're full

712
01:16:04,358 --> 01:16:08,998
In Austria we always get the how Falls are completely filled

713
01:16:09,968 --> 01:16:11,438
just like

714
01:16:11,438 --> 01:16:13,438
also in Italy

715
01:16:14,948 --> 01:16:22,347
There is never death of people. I mean people have to sit on the stairs in Austria isn't it we don't have that problem

716
01:16:23,528 --> 01:16:25,528
but getting realization

717
01:16:25,688 --> 01:16:28,317
Is not possible for everyone perhaps

718
01:16:30,098 --> 01:16:32,488
There's some sort of an understanding needed I

719
01:16:33,128 --> 01:16:37,587
can't explain why because the house are also lighted you see in the

720
01:16:38,258 --> 01:16:44,788
Halls are absolutely filled people sit on the stairs you see some are sitting outside some are standing on the street

721
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:50,458
Is there despite those facts there are sex and brain ceases?

722
01:16:52,298 --> 01:16:54,298
Did you write free

723
01:17:01,238 --> 01:17:07,738
Please come now gradually. They will see they have to learn their lessons a little bit more. I think that's all

724
01:17:09,248 --> 01:17:12,748
They have to learn their lessons a little bit more now you with you

725
01:17:12,748 --> 01:17:16,468
I'll tell you why because you are in the you and a big boss there

726
01:17:16,778 --> 01:17:19,077
Working in the you and itself's pulse your head

727
01:17:19,078 --> 01:17:22,528
I tell you I know my husband is there so I know all of them and

728
01:17:22,868 --> 01:17:25,977
Their heads get swollen up to see you and personalities

729
01:17:25,978 --> 01:17:32,338
And you are attending big conferences you see so-called big big people receive it because you see me to

730
01:17:33,278 --> 01:17:37,977
Be the big head these things do not go in so it's alright, but now you are alright

731
01:17:37,978 --> 01:17:42,508
But that is one of the things you want people bureaucrats at the worst of all

732
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:49,618
There will be the last to come to sahaja yoga, my husband is a bit of that and I would deal with them

733
01:17:49,618 --> 01:17:53,037
I never talked to them about sahaja yoga, never never never

734
01:17:55,778 --> 01:17:59,608
Bureaucrats Anthony you see they they only want to serve government. That's all

735
01:18:00,188 --> 01:18:03,928
They don't understand anything. They are so bureaucracy is like that

736
01:18:05,168 --> 01:18:08,848
Now what else you have in Austria bureaucracy, then you have military

737
01:18:11,378 --> 01:18:13,378
Students

738
01:18:16,368 --> 01:18:18,368
Yes

739
01:18:42,738 --> 01:18:44,738
Why should you have to

740
01:18:44,988 --> 01:18:47,258
Do why should you have to rush it?

741
01:18:48,018 --> 01:18:53,437
There's no need at all I would be very happy if they don't worship like you see those who worship me

742
01:18:53,808 --> 01:18:55,897
And found out something good out of it

743
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:58,658
that's whatever so actually you know I hate that I

744
01:18:59,118 --> 01:19:04,868
Always see that these puja should be so much lengthy that I have some time to rest this

745
01:19:05,808 --> 01:19:11,408
But I don't want them to worship me at all. It's very good. That's very good of them

746
01:19:11,408 --> 01:19:14,227
I tell you some of them when they touch my feet I get blisters

747
01:19:15,888 --> 01:19:19,867
Horrible as if yesterday. I was telling you like scorpion I

748
01:19:20,568 --> 01:19:23,438
get such big big blisters on my feet I

749
01:19:24,018 --> 01:19:26,497
Don't want them to wash it if you ask me

750
01:19:27,078 --> 01:19:30,428
But they would like to because you know what it means

751
01:19:31,008 --> 01:19:32,598
What's shipping me?

752
01:19:32,598 --> 01:19:34,598
You all know it very well

753
01:19:35,418 --> 01:19:37,418
What's shipping? What do you give me nothing?

754
01:19:38,388 --> 01:19:42,097
You just say certain mantras is that what do you give me nothing?

755
01:19:42,648 --> 01:19:46,958
That's nothing to worship me for example now see my photograph this one

756
01:19:49,398 --> 01:19:51,877
Is when I was sitting in a village

757
01:19:53,478 --> 01:19:58,868
When I entered the village I told him there is a very great soul who lived in this village

758
01:19:59,178 --> 01:20:02,167
They said there was one. He was a Muslim his name was Mia

759
01:20:03,618 --> 01:20:05,618
So I said now

760
01:20:06,198 --> 01:20:13,118
He must have been still here, and I sat down to be my lecture and I saw the spirit

761
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:18,337
Coming as a light of two. Hexa words to say on top of my head

762
01:20:18,338 --> 01:20:19,388
I saw it right

763
01:20:19,388 --> 01:20:25,687
but you can't see I mean people can't see but camera captured it the camera captured it and

764
01:20:26,088 --> 01:20:31,268
Then the the sun's rays through that prism like spirit

765
01:20:31,908 --> 01:20:36,127
Started coming as all seven colours on me. I could see

766
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:43,878
I could see then I was very happy with increasing in this report, but nobody could see and then I said alright now

767
01:20:43,878 --> 01:20:46,007
It's more than sufficient like that I said

768
01:20:46,557 --> 01:20:51,977
But nobody can see it now. What's this am I telling them that yeah, you should see because you will not see

769
01:20:54,568 --> 01:21:01,967
So why'd you tell anybody about my worshipping also till they understand it, but the camera caught it. What can I do?

770
01:21:03,868 --> 01:21:06,557
And what the camera caught it I didn't say

771
01:21:08,818 --> 01:21:11,237
Why do they worship Christ I've never seen in you

772
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:19,697
Why do they worship Christ murder they have never seen her what did she do she was just crying all her life

773
01:21:19,698 --> 01:21:23,628
she didn't give realization to anybody even Christ did not give realization to

774
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:28,607
Anyone why do they worship him

775
01:21:30,718 --> 01:21:32,898
You are a Christian you should ask them a question

776
01:21:37,318 --> 01:21:39,318
Why do the Muslims worship Kaaba

777
01:21:45,798 --> 01:21:51,168
But in sahaja yoga, I am a discovery for you. I never asked anyone to worship me never, baba

778
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:53,668
It's horrible for me

779
01:21:53,668 --> 01:22:00,377
I have frightened of people trying to worship me because you see I have to take up everything of the stuff in everything that you

780
01:22:03,478 --> 01:22:06,917
Well yeah, they can tell me you that I just don't like it

781
01:22:08,758 --> 01:22:13,188
And I want to make a big gaps in between you see so that at least have some time to rest

782
01:22:13,348 --> 01:22:16,368
Do something the whole thing digest it and take it out

783
01:22:17,788 --> 01:22:23,207
So you need not tell them at all in the beginning you should not tell them anything concerns that you are great come along

784
01:22:23,848 --> 01:22:25,848
Let them have the realization

785
01:22:26,218 --> 01:22:28,218
then if they're saying

786
01:22:30,118 --> 01:22:35,237
Then we should consider whether they should worship me or not and everybody is not allowed to worship also

787
01:22:37,738 --> 01:22:40,548
Do you know that Mary we don't allow everyone to come

788
01:22:41,488 --> 01:22:44,118
You have to be a clean person, otherwise they are not allowed

789
01:22:45,298 --> 01:22:50,178
So the this worship is your privilege not mind by any chance. I tell you

790
01:22:52,798 --> 01:22:56,928
Any chance and which you will all say that mother is chance it I

791
01:22:57,778 --> 01:23:03,048
Really, shun it and these false gurus because nothing happens to them they like it so

792
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:08,957
There's no explanation for this it is to be seen

793
01:23:10,378 --> 01:23:11,898
if they come to sahaja, yoga

794
01:23:11,898 --> 01:23:18,587
They can see it very well unless until they come in it you should not talk of me as anything as incarnation anything

795
01:23:18,588 --> 01:23:23,958
Just don't talk you should not tell them how to worship or anything just tell them that you have to get your realization

796
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:28,277
Let them first open their eyes then talk to them about these things

797
01:23:28,588 --> 01:23:33,768
In the beginning if you start talking they will be stuck no doubt they are stuck because they have not reached that thought

798
01:23:36,748 --> 01:23:40,248
They have to be seaworthy to be in the sea isn't it

799
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,018
Yes

800
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:55,067
Nothing is needed to begin with actually and I don't want anything really

801
01:23:58,168 --> 01:24:00,168
If there is anything that

802
01:24:00,928 --> 01:24:04,608
Is to be done is to give realization to everyone, that's all

803
01:24:05,668 --> 01:24:07,668
but to progress further

804
01:24:08,098 --> 01:24:10,048
They have to worship

805
01:24:10,048 --> 01:24:12,228
They will worship somebody who is dead and gone

806
01:24:13,828 --> 01:24:18,078
They never worship Christ when he lived they never worshipped his mother when he lived she lived

807
01:24:18,288 --> 01:24:24,497
They never worship drama. They never worship, Krishna now when they are dead were nice to worship because they are stones now

808
01:24:24,498 --> 01:24:26,498
What can they do to you?

809
01:24:28,708 --> 01:24:31,187
That's human nature when somebody is dead

810
01:24:32,098 --> 01:24:36,797
Then be perfect all right the ones who crucified Christ have raised these churches

811
01:24:42,538 --> 01:24:45,587
When person leaves you see in the present you never appreciate

812
01:24:52,898 --> 01:24:59,458
Because we don't allow anybody to worship, also. It's very it's a great privilege for anyone to be there

813
01:25:00,608 --> 01:25:02,287
You know that?

814
01:25:02,287 --> 01:25:04,287
It's not for everyone so

815
01:25:04,537 --> 01:25:09,447
Many people have been denied in England and all that just now you have to prepare yourself

816
01:25:10,988 --> 01:25:12,988
Everywhere

817
01:25:14,138 --> 01:25:18,358
And yesterday I was telling me know that you should not have brought clad lady. She was no good

818
01:25:19,118 --> 01:25:21,118
The one who was your roommate Oh?

819
01:25:22,537 --> 01:25:28,767
Was pestering you I said, she was very caught up, and you should not have brought her from the Buddhist that disturbs me

820
01:25:33,548 --> 01:25:39,597
It's very significant, but like a person who has to be a postgraduate student to understand certain things

821
01:25:40,327 --> 01:25:44,277
You have to be a postgraduate in sahaja yoga to be in aversion

822
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:53,817
Otherwise you should not so you don't stock of these things. It'll get stuck no doubt when I have no doubts about it

823
01:25:56,738 --> 01:25:58,738
Anybody would get stuck

824
01:25:59,528 --> 01:26:06,838
Because looks so funny isn't it that you have to worship another human being it is so we have to use discretion

825
01:26:10,478 --> 01:26:15,177
Anybody would be stuck that way unless until you are a first-class sahaja yogi

826
01:26:15,178 --> 01:26:20,128
And you understand the value of it you have gone deep into it. Then only you realize

827
01:26:22,298 --> 01:26:24,298
It's to be appreciated

828
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:37,146
I never talked about me at all to anyone now. I really some Saints started talking about me

829
01:26:39,017 --> 01:26:41,916
Some Saints only told some people that this is this

830
01:26:42,737 --> 01:26:45,697
Then they came and asked me and I said all right you find out for yourself

831
01:26:51,408 --> 01:26:56,948
You see with human beings you have to be very very careful and cautious, I do not want to get crucified

832
01:26:58,517 --> 01:26:59,928
See

833
01:26:59,928 --> 01:27:06,607
To be very very cautious with them because ego is the first thing they come in they don't understand. What is beneficial for them

834
01:27:07,158 --> 01:27:12,127
See what did Christ do to them did he ruin them, or do any bad to them, but they crucified him isn't it?

835
01:27:12,647 --> 01:27:14,647
They gave poison to Muhammad SAW

836
01:27:15,587 --> 01:27:17,617
Why what was the thing?

837
01:27:18,527 --> 01:27:21,037
Because he go so should we calculate

838
01:27:23,297 --> 01:27:29,677
Even when you write supposing in your wherever you write should write it cautiously she make it so that

839
01:27:30,468 --> 01:27:33,637
According to your own understanding that they come to my program

840
01:27:34,698 --> 01:27:36,468
Use your wisdom

841
01:27:36,468 --> 01:27:38,857
What you want to put it how to put it?

842
01:27:39,857 --> 01:27:45,907
or if you want to say you can say that at the first instance the Kundalini rises and

843
01:27:46,547 --> 01:27:50,017
Then you have to grow into it if you don't want to say quick

844
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:55,928
instant coffee business, so you may say like this that might might reprise I

845
01:27:56,448 --> 01:27:58,448
Would suggest that way?

846
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:01,387
All right that you turn

847
01:28:01,388 --> 01:28:05,917
But with the people some of the very deep people they just get realization in

848
01:28:06,167 --> 01:28:10,657
Thousand it because they have been deep people all their lives not life, but lies

849
01:28:11,567 --> 01:28:13,567
So they just hit it

850
01:28:16,428 --> 01:28:21,818
So it attracts people who are superficial then it's not a good thing to say

851
01:28:29,448 --> 01:28:33,038
That may be one of the reasons that only superficial come to our program

852
01:28:35,628 --> 01:28:39,668
We should find out how to write that the deep people are attracted

853
01:28:40,338 --> 01:28:46,597
Isn't it we should find out ways and methods by deep people are attracted not superficial I?

854
01:28:48,138 --> 01:28:51,668
Gave you the whole gets filled up because maybe superficial

855
01:28:53,418 --> 01:28:59,647
Like a saint on see nobody buys anything. It's just to say law and everybody comes to see the same

856
01:29:04,278 --> 01:29:06,697
This is Kali why is he this is a

857
01:29:07,548 --> 01:29:12,608
Confused state in this. This is a this is the age of confusion

858
01:29:19,338 --> 01:29:22,177
This is the age of confusion really?

859
01:29:26,358 --> 01:29:32,858
Also some people say that why should I give realization? I said better you give very good idea

860
01:29:33,098 --> 01:29:35,098
I would like to return

861
01:29:35,778 --> 01:29:39,818
See this is ego. Isn't it? Why should you do it?

862
01:29:39,818 --> 01:29:45,367
I mean I'm doing it because I do it alright, but if you can do it nothing like it. I'll return

863
01:29:45,408 --> 01:29:47,408
I'll be very happy I

864
01:29:49,248 --> 01:29:56,107
Mean my age has is beyond doubt retirement I would have retired long time back see going on and on

865
01:30:02,208 --> 01:30:05,317
So also you should see the people who they are and

866
01:30:06,048 --> 01:30:07,938
Then talk to them

867
01:30:07,938 --> 01:30:11,827
Must use discretion very important to use discretion

868
01:30:15,588 --> 01:30:20,588
As he said it may be some people may not get it in this lifetime, maybe next time

869
01:30:22,338 --> 01:30:26,768
Also it happens that the seer some

870
01:30:28,038 --> 01:30:32,587
people get realization say for example and the transform and

871
01:30:33,408 --> 01:30:35,408
become something very beautiful

872
01:30:35,988 --> 01:30:38,858
Then the mediocre mediocre people you see

873
01:30:39,648 --> 01:30:42,127
May see that and try to follow it

874
01:30:43,758 --> 01:30:45,758
The mediocre may try to follow it

875
01:30:49,098 --> 01:30:53,978
Like when I went to Italy this gentleman was a very famous person who interviewed me

876
01:30:54,348 --> 01:30:57,338
He said first you give me realization then I'll Italy

877
01:31:00,498 --> 01:31:02,268
Because

878
01:31:02,268 --> 01:31:06,907
Perhaps he believed in me whatever. It was or may not have believed might be doubting whatever it is

879
01:31:07,098 --> 01:31:09,848
He got his realization, then he started laughing

880
01:31:11,057 --> 01:31:15,067
And he said also, I've got it now. I said yes, you got it now

881
01:31:15,068 --> 01:31:19,807
It is he who is organizing all this thing so maybe like this it might forgot

882
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:23,798
Depends all you see human beings are quite complicated in modern times

883
01:31:25,698 --> 01:31:31,807
Very difficult to hold on to them if you give them this they'll come this way if you give them that they'll come this way

884
01:31:32,088 --> 01:31:34,088
Just I don't want to have it

885
01:31:36,268 --> 01:31:41,027
Just some hooks or excuses it's terrible I know

886
01:31:42,358 --> 01:31:44,748
Especially in the West it's very difficult

887
01:31:48,688 --> 01:31:52,217
But they'll accept her something stupid like Punk's

888
01:31:53,698 --> 01:31:55,698
Thanks you will find thousands now

889
01:31:58,168 --> 01:32:04,697
People in very high positions are punks now. Can you believe it imagine our Prime Minister going as a punk?

890
01:32:06,388 --> 01:32:09,708
They accept stupid things without any questioning

891
01:32:11,787 --> 01:32:14,717
Think of it drugs for example

892
01:32:18,418 --> 01:32:22,938
They accept it without any understanding without any asking and very

893
01:32:24,028 --> 01:32:25,618
educated

894
01:32:25,618 --> 01:32:27,618
highly placed people doing

895
01:32:27,988 --> 01:32:29,988
Absurd things like that

896
01:32:30,807 --> 01:32:34,607
Alcoholism womanizing everything all nonsensical things

897
01:32:38,128 --> 01:32:42,737
But to do something good to yourself it takes time a

898
01:32:45,748 --> 01:32:47,927
Very self-destructive by temperament

899
01:32:49,378 --> 01:32:51,708
Just do something nice to ourselves

900
01:32:53,218 --> 01:32:55,907
To get some blessings upon ourselves yes

901
01:33:03,577 --> 01:33:05,577
We'll be all right

902
01:33:06,877 --> 01:33:11,937
They have to learn their lessons that's collecting as they have to learn their lesson

903
01:33:19,267 --> 01:33:21,267
Satisfied

904
01:33:22,477 --> 01:33:25,017
I'm happy he's a very wise man

905
01:33:25,017 --> 01:33:30,686
He's done the homework the other people just came just like any that for fuck out you see it's a deep subject

906
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:33,147
It's a very deep subject

907
01:33:33,428 --> 01:33:35,198
you cannot just

908
01:33:35,198 --> 01:33:37,198
Up here and go out

909
01:33:41,587 --> 01:33:43,587
Steve are you going to?

910
01:34:21,548 --> 01:34:24,447
Put this into the world

911
01:34:45,218 --> 01:34:47,667
No, but you see well one point

912
01:34:47,667 --> 01:34:52,586
I see in is what he's saying that one of the things this really come to my mind is this

913
01:34:52,747 --> 01:34:55,617
That this may be that we get superficial people

914
01:35:00,428 --> 01:35:04,198
So we should put something deep in it because it's very deep experience

915
01:35:07,988 --> 01:35:12,508
Suggestion you see there is something which explains certain things

916
01:35:14,557 --> 01:35:20,186
They like my lectures all right, they like to listen to my lecture because you see it appeals to them mind

917
01:35:20,707 --> 01:35:25,287
But they don't get realization so that means they are not very deep

918
01:35:39,997 --> 01:35:41,997
Yes, that is one thing yeah

919
01:35:42,517 --> 01:35:46,557
Now for example in Switzerland we put our these things

920
01:35:47,318 --> 01:35:52,797
Nobody removed it still their last three years. It is there. It's very surprising in Switzerland

921
01:35:52,798 --> 01:35:56,907
Where people are so meticulous they have kept my photographs?

922
01:35:58,267 --> 01:36:00,158
In Italy us

923
01:36:00,158 --> 01:36:02,607
All my three year old photographs are there

924
01:36:03,727 --> 01:36:10,257
It is there. What about also I must say that advertising whatever it was in

925
01:36:13,388 --> 01:36:15,388
Australia

926
01:36:16,207 --> 01:36:18,207
Australia is

927
01:36:18,397 --> 01:36:20,397
very progressive in such

928
01:36:21,068 --> 01:36:23,048
Australians imagine

929
01:36:23,048 --> 01:36:25,048
Can you believe it that they were?

930
01:36:25,178 --> 01:36:30,057
Sent there as criminals their forefathers and today. They are the ones who are going to take everyone to

931
01:36:30,607 --> 01:36:32,557
spirituality

932
01:36:32,557 --> 01:36:34,557
So how can you say good and bad?

933
01:36:37,448 --> 01:36:39,127
Australia is the best

934
01:36:39,127 --> 01:36:41,127
Well Stella is the best now I?

935
01:36:41,857 --> 01:36:50,297
Mean in progress. We have the leader from Australia for the Warren started the whole thing and we have James has he come

936
01:36:59,618 --> 01:37:01,918
May God bless you may God bless you
