1
00:33:45,663 --> 00:33:47,463
I want to introduce to you,

2
00:33:48,623 --> 00:33:51,343
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Thank you.

3
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:39,823
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

4
00:34:43,423 --> 00:34:48,663
I explained to you yesterday

5
00:34:48,863 --> 00:34:54,423
that seekers are a special category of human beings,

6
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:58,743
and they have to first seek their Self.

7
00:34:59,463 --> 00:35:01,383
They are to be blessed first

8
00:35:01,623 --> 00:35:05,703
and then the rest of the world will follow them.

9
00:35:06,783 --> 00:35:11,823
Dr. Warren has explained to you at length

10
00:35:11,982 --> 00:35:15,023
the connection between the gross and the subtle,

11
00:35:15,223 --> 00:35:19,623
how the different centers are related to different plexuses,

12
00:35:19,823 --> 00:35:21,903
very clearly.

13
00:35:22,343 --> 00:35:27,743
When I did my medicine the names of these plexuses were different.

14
00:35:27,943 --> 00:35:30,823
Now they are different,

15
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:32,743
and every day it is changing

16
00:35:32,943 --> 00:35:36,743
because they are finding new and new things.

17
00:35:36,982 --> 00:35:42,063
But when you get your Self Realization, when you become the Self,

18
00:35:42,263 --> 00:35:45,703
then you don’t live in any relative world.

19
00:35:46,263 --> 00:35:50,183
Today the problem of religions who are fighting among themselves,

20
00:35:50,383 --> 00:35:54,703
like Christians have so many cults, Hindus have so many cults,

21
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:58,183
Muslims have so many divisions,

22
00:35:58,383 --> 00:36:01,783
this is only because they are understanding God

23
00:36:01,982 --> 00:36:04,982
through their mental projections,

24
00:36:05,143 --> 00:36:09,623
because they are not on absolute state.

25
00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:12,743
When it comes to mental projection

26
00:36:12,943 --> 00:36:17,823
one can go on interpreting the same thing in hundred ways.

27
00:36:17,982 --> 00:36:22,343
Like Bible can be interpreted this way or that way, intellectually.

28
00:36:22,983 --> 00:36:29,063
When you are in the absolute, then absolute is only one.

29
00:36:29,703 --> 00:36:32,143
You cannot have many cults, many interpretations.

30
00:36:32,343 --> 00:36:33,982
There cannot be many.

31
00:36:34,143 --> 00:36:37,983
So when you become the Self, the first thing that happens to you

32
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:41,943
that you enter into the state of absolute.

33
00:36:42,343 --> 00:36:46,023
Your hands start speaking,

34
00:36:46,223 --> 00:36:48,903
on your fingertips you start feeling it.

35
00:36:49,063 --> 00:36:53,143
It doesn't think, it just gives you the indications.

36
00:36:53,623 --> 00:36:56,823
Supposing you want to find out, is there God?

37
00:36:56,983 --> 00:36:59,103
You have to just put your hands like this,

38
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:04,863
and ask the question 3 times: “Is there God?”, from your heart.

39
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:09,982
And you’ll be amazed the vibrations
will be very strong on your hands.

40
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:14,183
This is the proof that there is God.

41
00:37:14,703 --> 00:37:17,543
The time has come to prove the existence of God,

42
00:37:17,743 --> 00:37:20,982
prove the existence of all-pervading Power.

43
00:37:21,183 --> 00:37:23,463
You turn around to all-pervading Power,

44
00:37:23,703 --> 00:37:26,103
put your hands towards it and ask,

45
00:37:26,303 --> 00:37:30,983
"Is there the power of God which is all-pervading,

46
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:34,063
which is doing all the living work?

47
00:37:34,343 --> 00:37:37,023
You start getting cool breeze in your hand tremendously.

48
00:37:37,223 --> 00:37:39,783
This is the power for the first time you feel

49
00:37:39,982 --> 00:37:42,663
when you get your Self Realization.

50
00:37:42,863 --> 00:37:46,063
This is the power that does all the living works,

51
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:48,823
these flowers, they become fruits,

52
00:37:48,982 --> 00:37:52,743
the buds become the flowers, the trees grow.

53
00:37:52,982 --> 00:37:55,183
You have parasympathetic working in you

54
00:37:55,383 --> 00:37:57,303
which is, they call it, autonomous.

55
00:37:57,703 --> 00:38:01,423
But what is auto, who is the auto? That’s the Spirit.

56
00:38:01,663 --> 00:38:06,463
They don’t know what to call it. They have got a name for it,

57
00:38:06,783 --> 00:38:09,823
Exactly the same as it should be, is the auto.

58
00:38:09,982 --> 00:38:12,823
But by giving a name you do not explain what it is.

59
00:38:12,982 --> 00:38:14,183
It is the Spirit.

60
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:17,423
The Spirit does all the autonomous work within ourselves.

61
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:21,982
That is the one that works out our parasympathetic.

62
00:38:22,143 --> 00:38:27,023
But still as long as your Spirit is not in your awareness,

63
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:29,982
as long as it has not come in your attention,

64
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:34,223
it is just a witness, it is just witnessing what you are doing.

65
00:38:34,423 --> 00:38:37,623
It is looking at.

66
00:38:39,303 --> 00:38:43,223
We have that reflection in your heart.

67
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:46,823
People who get heart attacks are of two types

68
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:52,063
one who have lethargic heart and another one who are active heart.

69
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,463
Those who suffer from active hearts,

70
00:38:54,703 --> 00:38:57,703
are the people who are very futuristic, right sided,

71
00:38:57,903 --> 00:39:00,583
who think too much about the future.

72
00:39:00,783 --> 00:39:03,743
And other ones, the ones who have a lethargic heart,

73
00:39:03,943 --> 00:39:08,863
are the people who are left sided, who are very much conditioned,

74
00:39:09,023 --> 00:39:10,663
who are worried about the past,

75
00:39:10,863 --> 00:39:14,903
who live with their ideas of sufferings.

76
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:19,583
But once the Spirit is awakened within you, it looks after you.

77
00:39:19,783 --> 00:39:23,423
It takes over, and you become a person

78
00:39:23,663 --> 00:39:26,663
who is guided by your Spirit, which is absolute.

79
00:39:26,903 --> 00:39:29,463
And that’s why it explains why

80
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:32,623
in religion there are so many complications.

81
00:39:32,823 --> 00:39:35,623
Whatever you want to decide through your ego,

82
00:39:35,823 --> 00:39:38,143
through your mental projections, is linear,

83
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:41,783
It moves in a linear direction and it recoils back.

84
00:39:41,982 --> 00:39:44,983
That’s why you have seen, all human enterprises

85
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:46,943
have ended up into trouble.

86
00:39:47,103 --> 00:39:49,583
We tried with science, we became

87
00:39:49,783 --> 00:39:52,623
the creators of atom bomb which destroys.

88
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:56,023
We try with anything, even with emotional side we start.

89
00:39:56,223 --> 00:39:58,583
What we find we get bound to it,

90
00:39:58,783 --> 00:40:02,583
get miseries and troubles in our emotional endeavors also.

91
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:05,823
So one reaches a point where one realizes

92
00:40:05,982 --> 00:40:11,663
that we have not reached that completion, that epitome,

93
00:40:11,863 --> 00:40:17,743
that highest state where we become knowledgeable to the absolute,

94
00:40:17,943 --> 00:40:20,703
absolute knowledge of everything.

95
00:40:21,063 --> 00:40:24,823
At a human level we know so many things, at absolute level.

96
00:40:24,982 --> 00:40:30,463
Like we know this is a wood. A dog may not know about it.

97
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:34,783
We know about this, but we do not know whether this wood

98
00:40:34,982 --> 00:40:38,463
has been touched by some saint or not.

99
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,743
We are not sure about it.

100
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:45,143
We cannot say that is this a holy wood or not?

101
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:49,063
We cannot make it out. Somebody might say,

102
00:40:49,263 --> 00:40:51,703
“This is the one who was touched by somebody”,

103
00:40:51,903 --> 00:40:54,023
somebody might say “No, how can you say that?”

104
00:40:54,223 --> 00:40:57,463
There’s no way of deciding what is the truth

105
00:40:57,703 --> 00:41:00,982
because you are not at the state of absolute.

106
00:41:01,223 --> 00:41:05,103
All your theories that are prevalent

107
00:41:05,303 --> 00:41:08,023
like you say capitalism, communism,

108
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:12,263
all these “-ism" that we talk of, are also relative.

109
00:41:12,982 --> 00:41:16,023
For example, if I say “I am the greatest capitalist”.

110
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,982
Supposing I have all the powers, then I am the greatest capitalist.

111
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:21,943
But I am the greatest communist

112
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:25,823
because I cannot live with them, I have to share with all of you,

113
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:29,343
I have to move about, I have to travel and travel and travel,

114
00:41:29,623 --> 00:41:31,303
that I should share with all of you.

115
00:41:31,463 --> 00:41:36,063
I cannot enjoy it alone, so I’m the greatest communist as well.

116
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:38,703
All the theories that we have in your minds

117
00:41:38,903 --> 00:41:41,383
have come out of the unconscious

118
00:41:41,623 --> 00:41:43,383
to create that gross part of it.

119
00:41:43,663 --> 00:41:46,023
Like people talk of United Nations.

120
00:41:46,223 --> 00:41:50,583
United Nations seems to be a myth, if you face it.

121
00:41:50,783 --> 00:41:53,303
You can’t understand this kind of a United Nations

122
00:41:53,463 --> 00:41:55,982
where everybody’s pulling each other’s legs,

123
00:41:56,143 --> 00:41:59,743
There’s a problem on how many jobs should be given to whom,

124
00:41:59,943 --> 00:42:03,743
how much pay, and everything dealing on very gross levels.

125
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:08,383
But you see that when you become

126
00:42:08,623 --> 00:42:11,823
a realized soul - there are 14 nations now,

127
00:42:11,982 --> 00:42:14,823
were representing, were represented in India,

128
00:42:14,982 --> 00:42:17,823
and all of them if you have seen, very happy people,

129
00:42:17,982 --> 00:42:21,463
extremely joyous, such friendship, such enjoyment

130
00:42:21,703 --> 00:42:24,903
and a little bit of fun,

131
00:42:25,063 --> 00:42:27,943
of ragging each other sometimes, pulling each other’s legs,

132
00:42:28,103 --> 00:42:30,663
and then again enjoying and mirth

133
00:42:30,863 --> 00:42:34,543
real enjoyment. No quarreling, no fighting,

134
00:42:34,743 --> 00:42:38,023
no question of race, nothing of the kind.

135
00:42:38,383 --> 00:42:43,143
This kind of the new race has to be evolved out of the people.

136
00:42:43,943 --> 00:42:45,463
So this is what happens to you,

137
00:42:45,703 --> 00:42:47,943
that you reach the state of absolute.

138
00:42:48,103 --> 00:42:50,143
So there cannot be cults in Sahaja Yoga,

139
00:42:50,343 --> 00:42:52,743
there cannot be a division of ideas,

140
00:42:52,943 --> 00:42:54,863
there cannot be any interpretations,

141
00:42:55,023 --> 00:42:57,823
because it is so much within you.

142
00:42:57,983 --> 00:43:01,743
Now the subjective and objective, we call it in a way, funny way.

143
00:43:01,943 --> 00:43:04,463
For us, objective is whatever is gross outside

144
00:43:04,703 --> 00:43:07,143
and subjective is something arbitrary.

145
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:09,183
But once you become a realized soul,

146
00:43:09,383 --> 00:43:11,383
you become really the subjective.

147
00:43:11,903 --> 00:43:14,743
You really become the subjective, in the sense your subject acts,

148
00:43:14,943 --> 00:43:16,903
but which is an absolute subject.

149
00:43:17,063 --> 00:43:20,703
So everybody has that absolute within themselves.

150
00:43:21,783 --> 00:43:24,903
Self is the universal being within yourself

151
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:29,063
Is the universal being and that is in everyone.

152
00:43:29,263 --> 00:43:32,943
It relates to the same, it’s an universal truth.

153
00:43:33,103 --> 00:43:36,023
So you cannot have two opinions about it.

154
00:43:36,223 --> 00:43:38,303
There’s no question of having opinions

155
00:43:38,463 --> 00:43:40,263
because it is so, it's a fact.

156
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:42,583
And whatever is the fact, that you accept.

157
00:43:42,783 --> 00:43:44,983
So the Spirit is the truth.

158
00:43:45,183 --> 00:43:47,383
There's no other way to find out the truth.

159
00:43:47,623 --> 00:43:49,183
Anything you want to find out,

160
00:43:49,383 --> 00:43:51,823
you have to find out through your vibrations,

161
00:43:51,982 --> 00:43:56,982
which is the blessing of your Self Realization.

162
00:43:57,263 --> 00:44:00,703
Without Self Realization, there is diversity.

163
00:44:00,903 --> 00:44:02,983
You find people are so diverse.

164
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:06,103
They are contradictive, they fight each other,

165
00:44:06,303 --> 00:44:10,063
they have such problems, that have no solutions.

166
00:44:10,263 --> 00:44:13,743
They live like parallel lines where they never meet.

167
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,743
But suddenly you find all these parallel lines meet

168
00:44:16,943 --> 00:44:18,823
at the South Pole or the North Pole.

169
00:44:18,983 --> 00:44:21,543
In the same way, they meet

170
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:24,783
at the same point, what we call the Spirit.

171
00:44:24,982 --> 00:44:29,943
At that times you have no problems, solving your problems,

172
00:44:30,103 --> 00:44:34,343
because there is no problem left, you are beyond it.

173
00:44:34,783 --> 00:44:37,343
Truth is something that exists, that is there.

174
00:44:37,663 --> 00:44:39,623
You cannot challenge it, it is so.

175
00:44:39,823 --> 00:44:42,463
Supposing a person is a devil,

176
00:44:42,703 --> 00:44:46,103
and you are following a devil as a guru, for example.

177
00:44:46,303 --> 00:44:48,982
Now you may argue out with Me, whatever you may do,

178
00:44:49,143 --> 00:44:50,823
but devil is a devil.

179
00:44:50,982 --> 00:44:54,623
You cannot get good vibrations from such a person.

180
00:44:54,823 --> 00:44:57,583
But supposing he’s a human being half backed,

181
00:44:57,783 --> 00:44:59,823
just little bit lost or something,

182
00:44:59,983 --> 00:45:03,463
such a person definitely, has a chance of transformation.

183
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:05,982
But the one who is a hard boiled,

184
00:45:06,143 --> 00:45:08,943
horrible fellow like Hitler, how can you change him?

185
00:45:09,103 --> 00:45:13,103
He cannot be changed. So forget about him, just forget about him.

186
00:45:13,303 --> 00:45:14,823
He doesn’t exist for us.

187
00:45:14,982 --> 00:45:17,823
You are not to bother about such hard boiled people.

188
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:21,983
But you develop a kind of a discreet wisdom,

189
00:45:22,183 --> 00:45:26,663
as it is in the little cell, at the tip of a root.

190
00:45:26,863 --> 00:45:31,343
How it penetrates to its own source and keeps to it

191
00:45:31,703 --> 00:45:35,982
following slowly through the soft parts of the earth

192
00:45:36,143 --> 00:45:38,263
and how it reaches the source.

193
00:45:38,623 --> 00:45:39,823
In the same way,

194
00:45:39,982 --> 00:45:44,263
you too develop that kind of a beautiful, innocent wisdom.

195
00:45:44,463 --> 00:45:49,023
Innocence is the source of wisdom, that’s the source of wisdom.

196
00:45:49,223 --> 00:45:52,383
If you have innocence, you become extremely wise.

197
00:45:52,623 --> 00:45:57,623
You have discretion, you have sense of direction,

198
00:45:57,823 --> 00:45:59,623
even gross direction.

199
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:02,743
A person whose innocence is intact,

200
00:46:02,943 --> 00:46:07,223
he can immediately tell you what is right, what is wrong.

201
00:46:07,423 --> 00:46:09,223
Not only that, but
he can tell you

202
00:46:09,423 --> 00:46:12,783
what is east, west, north and south.

203
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:17,023
Because he acts like a magnet, there’s a magnet in that person

204
00:46:17,223 --> 00:46:21,783
and he becomes a magnetic personality because of his innocence.

205
00:46:21,982 --> 00:46:25,103
You see, a child attracts the whole crowd,

206
00:46:25,303 --> 00:46:28,823
a child is such a beautiful thing because it is innocent.

207
00:46:28,982 --> 00:46:30,543
But the devilish part of it

208
00:46:30,743 --> 00:46:34,863
that nowadays we are busy attacking even that,

209
00:46:35,023 --> 00:46:36,823
the child’s innocence.

210
00:46:36,982 --> 00:46:40,903
So be careful that we preserve our innocence

211
00:46:41,063 --> 00:46:43,983
and respect the innocence outside.

212
00:46:45,023 --> 00:46:50,183
This Spirit when it manifests, it also gives you a state

213
00:46:50,383 --> 00:46:52,823
which we call as collective consciousness.

214
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:57,583
Is the state by which you become you, again I say become

215
00:46:57,783 --> 00:46:59,943
- it's actualization, it is not just talking -

216
00:47:00,103 --> 00:47:02,383
you become conscious collective,

217
00:47:02,623 --> 00:47:03,783
means you become

218
00:47:03,982 --> 00:47:07,383
conscious of another person's centers on your fingertips.

219
00:47:07,623 --> 00:47:10,303
You also become Self aware,

220
00:47:10,543 --> 00:47:11,943
you know about yourself,

221
00:47:12,103 --> 00:47:14,983
what centers are catching, where are we going.

222
00:47:15,183 --> 00:47:20,423
Like a person who becomes mentally upset, he doesn’t know,

223
00:47:20,663 --> 00:47:21,783
really becomes mad,

224
00:47:21,982 --> 00:47:25,023
goes to lunatic asylum and dies, he does not know.

225
00:47:25,223 --> 00:47:27,982
But in Sahaja Yoga immediately you can find out

226
00:47:28,143 --> 00:47:31,303
that there’s something going wrong with your mental side.

227
00:47:31,863 --> 00:47:33,743
If a person gets into cancer,

228
00:47:33,943 --> 00:47:38,982
he might get, gets into the state of galloping cancer, about to die,

229
00:47:39,143 --> 00:47:41,183
then he may discover that he has got cancer.

230
00:47:41,463 --> 00:47:43,743
But in Sahaja Yoga if there’s a little imbalance,

231
00:47:43,943 --> 00:47:47,663
immediately it shows on your fingertips, and if you know

232
00:47:47,863 --> 00:47:53,303
how to do it, how to correct it, then every problem is solved.

233
00:47:53,623 --> 00:47:57,143
So as I told you yesterday, yoga has double meaning.

234
00:47:57,343 --> 00:48:00,383
Yoga means union with the Divine, that’s one.

235
00:48:00,623 --> 00:48:04,063
and the second one is the expertise, the depthness,

236
00:48:04,263 --> 00:48:06,063
what we call in Sanskrit kaushalam.

237
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:07,943
You must have a depthness,

238
00:48:08,103 --> 00:48:11,543
how to handle this all-pervading Power that is flowing through us,

239
00:48:11,743 --> 00:48:15,063
how to understand ourselves, how to understand others,

240
00:48:15,263 --> 00:48:19,183
that’s an important part of Sahaja Yoga.

241
00:48:19,383 --> 00:48:22,903
First of al a little light is enlightened.

242
00:48:23,063 --> 00:48:25,943
You get the experience of the Spirit to begin with.

243
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,823
It's an actualization.

244
00:48:27,982 --> 00:48:30,543
But then you must make it grow.

245
00:48:30,743 --> 00:48:33,343
Christ has given beautiful parables

246
00:48:33,663 --> 00:48:36,223
explaining this, the sprouting of the seeds,

247
00:48:36,423 --> 00:48:38,823
which were thrown on the rocks,

248
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:43,143
some were thrown in the good soil and somewhere neglected.

249
00:48:43,343 --> 00:48:45,863
And we find that everyday happening.

250
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:48,823
Thousands come to My program and then I find

251
00:48:48,982 --> 00:48:50,982
some of them are lost in the rocks,

252
00:48:51,143 --> 00:48:53,063
some of them are wasted,

253
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,823
but some of them become huge big trees

254
00:48:55,982 --> 00:48:59,183
to give shade, joy and support to others.

255
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:01,103
We have to change this world.

256
00:49:01,303 --> 00:49:04,183
How are we going to change this world, this horrible world

257
00:49:04,383 --> 00:49:08,143
which is just under precipices of destruction?

258
00:49:08,343 --> 00:49:11,183
The only way is that we have to change ourselves.

259
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:14,383
That’s the transformation just waiting to happen.

260
00:49:14,623 --> 00:49:16,383
It's nothing that I am doing about you,

261
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:18,943
I really tell you, I don’t do anything.

262
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:22,463
I don’t do anything, I’m just waiting to get it.

263
00:49:22,703 --> 00:49:24,743
You just catch upon it and you get it.

264
00:49:24,943 --> 00:49:28,303
I’m maybe just triggering it, but you can trigger it also.

265
00:49:28,463 --> 00:49:32,743
So one has to understand that you have to be honest to yourself,

266
00:49:32,943 --> 00:49:34,623
you have to be fair to yourself.

267
00:49:34,823 --> 00:49:37,743
You have to understand your value, you must know your worth,

268
00:49:37,943 --> 00:49:39,982
that you are a human being created

269
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,383
out of small things like amoeba, from carbon,

270
00:49:43,623 --> 00:49:45,903
and today you are sitting here as human beings,

271
00:49:46,063 --> 00:49:48,063
you must be something very special.

272
00:49:48,263 --> 00:49:51,143
And this special thing has to become that thing

273
00:49:51,343 --> 00:49:53,943
which will make you understand what you are.

274
00:49:54,103 --> 00:49:56,143
Only thing you are not yet connected.

275
00:49:56,343 --> 00:50:01,103
Only thing is that you have not yet felt that divinity within you.

276
00:50:01,303 --> 00:50:03,783
We are all potentially divine.

277
00:50:03,982 --> 00:50:06,303
We have to just feel that divinity within us.

278
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:10,543
But as a result of that, you are such a powerful personality,

279
00:50:10,743 --> 00:50:12,383
power of love.

280
00:50:12,623 --> 00:50:15,583
We have never used the power of love,

281
00:50:15,783 --> 00:50:18,463
We have only used the power of hatred so far.

282
00:50:18,703 --> 00:50:22,023
Power of love is much above power of hatred.

283
00:50:22,223 --> 00:50:26,543
It can angle all hatred, can just

284
00:50:26,743 --> 00:50:29,143
suck in everything that is hatred.

285
00:50:29,343 --> 00:50:32,703
It’s very simple. Very simple methods are to be put,

286
00:50:32,903 --> 00:50:35,823
only you must have desire to get transformed.

287
00:50:36,943 --> 00:50:40,343
Now the third thing that happens with Self Realization

288
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:47,423
is that you get a state of peace, of bliss and of joy.

289
00:50:48,982 --> 00:50:52,903
When the Kundalini rises above this Agnya chakra

290
00:50:53,063 --> 00:50:55,743
you become thoughtlessly aware.

291
00:50:55,943 --> 00:50:59,303
It's called as Nirvichara Samadhi. Thoughtlessly aware,

292
00:50:59,463 --> 00:51:01,543
when there is no thought in your mind.

293
00:51:01,743 --> 00:51:03,383
If you want, you can think.

294
00:51:03,623 --> 00:51:05,943
If you want you can think, but if you don’t want,

295
00:51:06,103 --> 00:51:08,663
you can be in that state when you don’t think.

296
00:51:08,863 --> 00:51:10,623
Actually it’s maddening sometimes

297
00:51:10,823 --> 00:51:14,463
the way man is thinking morning till evening,

298
00:51:14,703 --> 00:51:18,583
yarns after yarns, useless things, a joyless pursuit.

299
00:51:18,783 --> 00:51:22,982
But when this thinking stops, you are above the thoughts.

300
00:51:23,383 --> 00:51:26,623
I would say to give it a similitude,

301
00:51:26,823 --> 00:51:30,263
that the waves of thought come and go away.

302
00:51:30,623 --> 00:51:32,863
Another thought comes and goes away.

303
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:36,983
We are jumping on the cusp of the thought all the time

304
00:51:37,183 --> 00:51:43,183
Supposing we can just get

305
00:51:43,383 --> 00:51:47,303
in the center of the thought,

306
00:51:47,463 --> 00:51:49,823
that is the present.

307
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:53,863
If we can, could stop at the present moment,

308
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:56,063
then we are not worried about the thoughts.

309
00:51:56,263 --> 00:51:58,903
Like the waves of water, if you are in the waves,

310
00:51:59,063 --> 00:52:00,703
you are frightened of that.

311
00:52:00,903 --> 00:52:02,823
But supposing you are in a boat

312
00:52:02,983 --> 00:52:06,623
then you can see the waves and enjoy them.

313
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:09,063
In the same way what happens to you

314
00:52:09,263 --> 00:52:15,663
that you jump up to a higher state of existence

315
00:52:15,863 --> 00:52:20,303
through which you see the thoughts

316
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:23,983
if you want, you don’t want to see you can, you need not see.

317
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:29,423
Now the thoughts that you see also, are very wide and deeper

318
00:52:29,663 --> 00:52:31,583
where you get inspirations.

319
00:52:31,783 --> 00:52:34,583
That’s why, as Dr. Warren has told you,

320
00:52:34,783 --> 00:52:37,383
that your creativity improves.

321
00:52:37,623 --> 00:52:40,943
You can become tremendously dynamic.

322
00:52:41,103 --> 00:52:43,623
Because your time is not wasted in wasteful things.

323
00:52:43,823 --> 00:52:45,943
You just know this is it.

324
00:52:46,103 --> 00:52:49,143
This is the exact, this is what we have to do.

325
00:52:49,623 --> 00:52:52,103
And that’s how people get rid of

326
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:55,143
many of their problems of mental tensions.

327
00:52:55,343 --> 00:52:58,823
There’s no tension at all. You don’t have any worries.

328
00:52:58,983 --> 00:53:01,983
You just see the thing like the witness.

329
00:53:02,183 --> 00:53:04,823
You become the witness of the whole drama.

330
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:06,223
When you are in the drama,

331
00:53:06,423 --> 00:53:08,823
you think you are a part and parcel of the drama

332
00:53:08,983 --> 00:53:11,143
sometimes you weep with it and cry with it.

333
00:53:11,343 --> 00:53:14,583
But when the drama is over, you realize it was just a drama.

334
00:53:14,783 --> 00:53:15,863
“I was not there”.

335
00:53:16,023 --> 00:53:17,783
In the same way it happens to you,

336
00:53:17,982 --> 00:53:20,103
that you achieve a witness state.

337
00:53:20,303 --> 00:53:24,263
It happens to you. Even if you want to get involved, you cannot.

338
00:53:24,463 --> 00:53:25,903
You just cannot get it.

339
00:53:26,063 --> 00:53:28,063
That’s how you can solve the problems better

340
00:53:28,263 --> 00:53:30,103
because you are away from the problems.

341
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:32,982
You can see what the problem is, but when you are in it,

342
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:37,103
you are upset, full of tension, worries,

343
00:53:37,303 --> 00:53:40,703
and sometimes people get so upset with it

344
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:43,703
that they commit suicides, when they find no solution.

345
00:53:43,903 --> 00:53:45,663
But if you are away from it,

346
00:53:45,863 --> 00:53:49,303
then you can definitely solve the problem.

347
00:53:50,023 --> 00:53:52,743
Now this witness state has to grow within you

348
00:53:52,943 --> 00:53:57,863
gradually, with little understanding and with little meditation,

349
00:53:58,023 --> 00:54:01,143
which is very simple, which you can do very easily.

350
00:54:01,343 --> 00:54:03,423
Nothing has to be done about.

351
00:54:03,663 --> 00:54:06,383
But first thing you must know, it is actualization,

352
00:54:06,623 --> 00:54:09,943
it is not your mental projection that is going to do anything.

353
00:54:10,103 --> 00:54:14,103
Like we may say, "we are all brothers and sisters". We say so.

354
00:54:14,903 --> 00:54:17,743
But when it comes to wars, we become enemies.

355
00:54:17,943 --> 00:54:20,823
Even in a family there are brothers and sisters,

356
00:54:20,982 --> 00:54:23,463
when it comes to property, they fight.

357
00:54:23,703 --> 00:54:27,663
Not in Sahaja Yoga. You really become part and parcel of each other.

358
00:54:27,863 --> 00:54:29,863
You feel the another person within yourself.

359
00:54:30,023 --> 00:54:31,903
That’s how the collective consciousness

360
00:54:32,063 --> 00:54:35,183
just comes into your central nervous system.

361
00:54:35,383 --> 00:54:37,183
That’s what it is, you have to feel it

362
00:54:37,383 --> 00:54:39,303
on your central nervous system.

363
00:54:39,623 --> 00:54:42,423
This is the word used by Buddha,

364
00:54:42,663 --> 00:54:44,823
which he calls as Bodha.

365
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:48,663
Bodha means that you feel on your central nervous system.

366
00:54:48,943 --> 00:54:50,743
Even Vedas means "Vidh".

367
00:54:50,943 --> 00:54:53,023
"Vidh" means on the central nervous system.

368
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:54,823
It is not in your brain

369
00:54:54,982 --> 00:54:57,863
because whatever you know in your brain is so limited,

370
00:54:58,023 --> 00:55:02,703
and can be changed, converted, brought to another view.

371
00:55:02,943 --> 00:55:06,823
but whatever you have known through your central nervous system,

372
00:55:06,982 --> 00:55:09,703
is the actual thing, is the actual fact,

373
00:55:09,903 --> 00:55:12,663
which you cannot contradict,

374
00:55:12,863 --> 00:55:15,823
you cannot diversify and you cannot challenge it.

375
00:55:15,982 --> 00:55:18,343
It is so, so it is.

376
00:55:19,023 --> 00:55:20,423
So one has to accept

377
00:55:20,743 --> 00:55:23,663
when you become the Spirit, that you are the Spirit.

378
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:27,263
That’s one of the things people cannot accept easily.

379
00:55:27,463 --> 00:55:29,303
They cannot assume.

380
00:55:29,463 --> 00:55:31,983
I’ve seen so many yogis who become yogis

381
00:55:32,183 --> 00:55:34,103
but they are so humble, so simple.

382
00:55:34,383 --> 00:55:36,982
Some of these gurus are so fake, horrible,

383
00:55:37,143 --> 00:55:40,383
they don’t know anything about God, anything about Spirit.

384
00:55:40,703 --> 00:55:44,703
They are nowhere near it, they are just money-oriented enterprisers,

385
00:55:44,903 --> 00:55:47,303
come down and big, talk so big,

386
00:55:47,463 --> 00:55:50,103
create such huge big organizations.

387
00:55:50,343 --> 00:55:52,143
As Dr. Warren was telling Me, “Mother,

388
00:55:52,343 --> 00:55:54,343
people have to sell their mortgages,

389
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,823
put everything into mortgages,

390
00:55:56,982 --> 00:55:59,863
sell of everything to become the disciples of these gurus.”

391
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:03,303
All these absurd things they do

392
00:56:03,623 --> 00:56:05,743
without knowing anything about God,

393
00:56:05,943 --> 00:56:08,263
without knowing anything about the Spirit.

394
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:12,183
All that is done and why you are a yogi now.

395
00:56:12,463 --> 00:56:16,023
You are the one who has achieved that state of yoga

396
00:56:16,223 --> 00:56:19,103
and still you do not feel that way.

397
00:56:19,303 --> 00:56:22,423
You become absolutely humble.

398
00:56:22,863 --> 00:56:25,823
You do not feel that you are a yogi,

399
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:29,263
you are a great person, because it becomes your nature.

400
00:56:29,463 --> 00:56:34,303
When it is your nature, you do not assume anything, it is there,

401
00:56:34,463 --> 00:56:36,823
it's not a false assumption but it’s a fact.

402
00:56:36,982 --> 00:56:39,663
So there’s nothing to be proud of,

403
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,903
there’s nothing to be thinking

404
00:56:42,063 --> 00:56:44,103
that you are doing something good to others,

405
00:56:44,303 --> 00:56:46,823
It is something that you are doing out of your own nature,

406
00:56:46,982 --> 00:56:48,063
nothing so special.

407
00:56:48,263 --> 00:56:51,103
As some people thank Me very much sometimes, I’m surprised,

408
00:56:51,303 --> 00:56:53,743
because I’m doing nothing I know. I do nothing.

409
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:55,623
It's just flowing through Me,

410
00:56:55,823 --> 00:57:00,143
I’m just watching it working out, but I’m doing nothing,

411
00:57:00,343 --> 00:57:04,143
I’m not working out anything. It’s just working out by itself.

412
00:57:04,343 --> 00:57:08,703
So when you achieve that state, you become a humble personality,

413
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:13,623
extremely humble, because you see that others are still blind,

414
00:57:13,823 --> 00:57:16,263
they haven’t seen the light, they are suffering so much.

415
00:57:16,463 --> 00:57:18,903
You are filled with such compassion and understanding.

416
00:57:19,063 --> 00:57:21,303
Sometimes they try to be very harsh with you,

417
00:57:21,463 --> 00:57:24,623
sometimes they try to bash you, trouble you, do everything.

418
00:57:24,823 --> 00:57:27,743
But the compassion is so great because you know they are children,

419
00:57:27,943 --> 00:57:30,383
they are stupid, they cannot see, doesn’t matter.

420
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,743
Let us work it out.

421
00:57:31,943 --> 00:57:33,183
And that’s how you work it

422
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:37,543
in such a compassionate, affectionate and kindly way

423
00:57:37,743 --> 00:57:42,103
And temper you do not get into, what you get into is a compassion.

424
00:57:42,303 --> 00:57:45,903
Sometimes, of course, you have to make a drama of a temper,

425
00:57:46,103 --> 00:57:48,863
just to make people all right, but just a drama.

426
00:57:49,023 --> 00:57:52,703
Inside you are all peaceful. There’s complete peace within yourself.

427
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:56,023
Because your Spirit is the source of peace.

428
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,743
We talk of peace outside,

429
00:57:58,943 --> 00:58:04,703
we organize big, big organizations

430
00:58:04,903 --> 00:58:07,663
to have seminars on peace,

431
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:10,703
have conferences of peace, representatives of peace,

432
00:58:10,903 --> 00:58:13,183
all fighting within themselves and without.

433
00:58:13,383 --> 00:58:16,103
We are all the time fighting with ourselves.

434
00:58:16,303 --> 00:58:21,143
We like something physically, then the mind says “No”,

435
00:58:21,343 --> 00:58:23,623
then the stomach says “Yes”.

436
00:58:23,823 --> 00:58:26,303
There’s a fight going on between ourselves.

437
00:58:26,623 --> 00:58:29,823
But when you become a realized soul,

438
00:58:29,982 --> 00:58:32,623
the fight outside and inside is finished,

439
00:58:32,823 --> 00:58:35,823
Because inside you get completely integrated.

440
00:58:35,982 --> 00:58:40,703
The last center is the center of Sahasrara, we call it,

441
00:58:40,903 --> 00:58:42,943
because there are thousand petals.

442
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:45,982
Thousand petals because there are thousand nerves

443
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,703
which get enlightened.

444
00:58:47,903 --> 00:58:51,343
And the light from the flame as you see in a candle,

445
00:58:51,663 --> 00:58:54,743
in the same way it appears like tongues of flames,

446
00:58:54,943 --> 00:58:57,703
beautiful tongues of flames of various colors,

447
00:58:57,903 --> 00:58:59,783
you see them opening out.

448
00:58:59,982 --> 00:59:02,623
First you don’t see, first you become the light

449
00:59:02,823 --> 00:59:05,623
and then you can see it also that it opens out

450
00:59:05,823 --> 00:59:10,943
as a beautiful lotus, of flames of beautiful colors.

451
00:59:11,103 --> 00:59:13,583
And you stand in between to see

452
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:17,823
that you are there watching all these within yourself.

453
00:59:17,982 --> 00:59:22,463
This center has a specialty, that all the centers you have seen

454
00:59:22,743 --> 00:59:27,303
the six centers, are placed in the head.

455
00:59:27,623 --> 00:59:31,863
This is what we call the station of the centers or the Pithas.

456
00:59:32,023 --> 00:59:33,823
Those centers are working there

457
00:59:33,982 --> 00:59:36,863
but actually their guarding forces are in the head.

458
00:59:37,023 --> 00:59:40,982
And when the Kundalini comes up and she integrates you

459
00:59:41,143 --> 00:59:44,783
and enlightens the brain, all these centers also get enlightened.

460
00:59:44,982 --> 00:59:48,823
and you feel that you are completely integrated.

461
00:59:48,982 --> 00:59:51,623
Your mind, your body, your soul,

462
00:59:51,823 --> 00:59:53,943
all work together, there's no fight.

463
00:59:54,103 --> 00:59:57,663
You are extremely restful, you are peaceful

464
00:59:57,863 --> 01:00:03,103
and the bliss you feel actually, actually as physical manifestation.

465
01:00:03,303 --> 01:00:06,983
For example, if you want to see something very beautiful,

466
01:00:07,183 --> 01:00:10,383
you see something very beautiful and you like it.

467
01:00:10,703 --> 01:00:13,823
Like Mona Lisa’s painting, now many people go to see that.

468
01:00:13,982 --> 01:00:16,823
They don’t know what they like about it, but I know what it is.

469
01:00:16,983 --> 01:00:21,063
When you watch that, there’s no thought, there’s no thought.

470
01:00:21,263 --> 01:00:22,703
When there is no thought,

471
01:00:22,903 --> 01:00:25,823
the creation of the artist in that photograph

472
01:00:25,982 --> 01:00:27,663
or in that painting

473
01:00:27,863 --> 01:00:30,743
or in any beautiful scene or anything that you see,

474
01:00:30,943 --> 01:00:33,623
the whole thing is reflected within you,

475
01:00:33,823 --> 01:00:38,663
as if it’s a rippleless ocean,

476
01:00:38,863 --> 01:00:40,823
or a rippleless lake

477
01:00:40,982 --> 01:00:44,103
in which all the surroundings are reflected completely.

478
01:00:44,303 --> 01:00:46,743
And then you feel actually physically

479
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:50,023
as if the joy and the peace is flowing down you

480
01:00:50,223 --> 01:00:51,823
like peaceful happening.

481
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,583
You feel that relaxation just coming on you.

482
01:00:54,783 --> 01:00:58,063
Physically also you feel it and you feel extremely charmed by that.

483
01:00:58,263 --> 01:01:02,982
But this feeling is only evident when you are a realized soul.

484
01:01:03,143 --> 01:01:04,703
Before that it hasn’t effect,

485
01:01:04,903 --> 01:01:06,823
that’s why you have seen all such things

486
01:01:06,982 --> 01:01:08,623
which are of eternal beauty

487
01:01:08,823 --> 01:01:11,343
are all those who give you vibrations.

488
01:01:11,623 --> 01:01:13,423
There have been many great people,

489
01:01:13,663 --> 01:01:15,903
artists who have been realized souls.

490
01:01:16,063 --> 01:01:17,943
I would say Mozart was a realized soul.

491
01:01:18,263 --> 01:01:19,982
There are many artists,

492
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:23,663
we can say Sistine Chapel done by Michelangelo -

493
01:01:23,863 --> 01:01:25,703
Michelangelo himself was a realized soul.

494
01:01:25,903 --> 01:01:28,743
The way he has put Christ there -

495
01:01:28,943 --> 01:01:31,423
Christ was like that, a huge, big personality

496
01:01:31,663 --> 01:01:33,823
like an Australian you can say,

497
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:35,943
huge, big personality standing there,

498
01:01:36,103 --> 01:01:38,463
bestrewing people to the right and the left.

499
01:01:38,703 --> 01:01:41,063
And the whole Sistine Chapel is nothing but the Kundalini.

500
01:01:41,263 --> 01:01:43,823
And He is standing at the Agnya. If you see it clear, it is so.

501
01:01:43,982 --> 01:01:46,183
And is strewing people on this side and that side

502
01:01:46,383 --> 01:01:48,823
with that mighty body of His.

503
01:01:48,982 --> 01:01:51,383
He has to be a man of a mighty body

504
01:01:51,623 --> 01:01:55,903
and of a very healthy appearance.

505
01:01:56,063 --> 01:01:58,823
While just below the Sistine Chapel,

506
01:01:58,983 --> 01:02:03,023
I saw a miserable looking, bony Christ,

507
01:02:03,223 --> 01:02:09,703
just like a TB patient put there on the table, by this pope.

508
01:02:09,982 --> 01:02:12,183
I was just amazed.

509
01:02:12,703 --> 01:02:16,863
Ask these popes to carry the cross.

510
01:02:17,023 --> 01:02:20,663
Even for two minutes they cannot carry it.

511
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:24,303
With that kind of a miserable body can you carry a cross?

512
01:02:24,463 --> 01:02:26,982
I don’t know what is the sadism behind it,

513
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,423
to show Christ in that miserable state.

514
01:02:29,743 --> 01:02:33,343
Just to show that we have to be miserable like Christ.

515
01:02:33,623 --> 01:02:35,543
When we talk of Christ

516
01:02:35,743 --> 01:02:38,903
we must know He said that, you are not to suffer anymore.

517
01:02:39,063 --> 01:02:40,823
Still there are many people they say:

518
01:02:40,982 --> 01:02:43,463
“Oh, we must suffer because Christ has suffered”.

519
01:02:43,703 --> 01:02:45,223
What can you suffer from Him?

520
01:02:45,423 --> 01:02:49,063
The amount of sufferings He had, you cannot suffer any more.

521
01:02:49,263 --> 01:02:52,143
He has suffered for you. Now it is for you to enjoy.

522
01:02:52,343 --> 01:02:56,063
He suffered for you so that He resides in Agnya chakra

523
01:02:56,263 --> 01:02:59,023
and He sucks in your ego and superego,

524
01:02:59,223 --> 01:03:02,143
He sucks in all your karmas and sins whatever are there,

525
01:03:02,343 --> 01:03:05,943
so you enter into the Kingdom of God to enjoy the citizenship,

526
01:03:06,103 --> 01:03:11,023
to enjoy the benevolence, to enjoy the blessings of God almighty.

527
01:03:11,623 --> 01:03:17,423
I must say the Divine is so anxious that you should enter into it.

528
01:03:17,743 --> 01:03:21,663
In these modern times even to talk about God is an impossibility.

529
01:03:21,863 --> 01:03:25,103
But we can prove the existence of God now within ourselves

530
01:03:25,303 --> 01:03:28,982
and we can show the All-pervading Power that exists.

531
01:03:29,463 --> 01:03:31,943
It is for us to turn round a little,

532
01:03:32,103 --> 01:03:36,223
to stop making everything mechanical,

533
01:03:36,423 --> 01:03:38,623
to know that there exists,

534
01:03:38,823 --> 01:03:41,823
the greatest power of greatest that we cannot handle.

535
01:03:41,982 --> 01:03:43,703
We cannot do any living work.

536
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:47,063
That living work which is done by this all-pervading Power,

537
01:03:47,263 --> 01:03:50,063
which is called in Sanskrit as Ritambhara Pragya.

538
01:03:50,263 --> 01:03:52,743
In the Patanjali’s Yoga Shastra,

539
01:03:52,943 --> 01:03:55,143
he has called it as Ritambhara Pragya.

540
01:03:55,343 --> 01:03:58,383
There are different names in different religions,

541
01:03:58,623 --> 01:04:00,863
like in Islam they call it Ruh,

542
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:05,303
Chaitanya, Logas, all kinds of names they have given to this.

543
01:04:05,463 --> 01:04:08,783
But they were aware of this great power

544
01:04:08,982 --> 01:04:11,703
that surrounds us and does all the living work.

545
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:17,023
So we also become in charge of that, we become experts on that.

546
01:04:17,303 --> 01:04:19,623
I give you a simple example,

547
01:04:19,823 --> 01:04:25,863
that as you have in the car a break and an accelerator,

548
01:04:26,023 --> 01:04:28,303
we have the left and the right side.

549
01:04:28,463 --> 01:04:31,663
We make mistakes when we are learning how to drive.

550
01:04:31,863 --> 01:04:34,823
We sometimes put the accelerator, sometimes a break,

551
01:04:34,983 --> 01:04:37,223
then gradually we master it,

552
01:04:37,423 --> 01:04:40,583
and we become an expert. Then we’ll start doing it automatically.

553
01:04:40,783 --> 01:04:42,543
That’s how we become the driver.

554
01:04:42,743 --> 01:04:47,223
But Self Realization is the thing where you become the master.

555
01:04:47,982 --> 01:04:51,463
The master is sitting behind and watching the driver,

556
01:04:51,743 --> 01:04:57,343
the left and the right, the break and the accelerator in himself

557
01:04:57,663 --> 01:04:59,982
and managing it nicely without doing anything.

558
01:05:00,183 --> 01:05:03,103
That’s what is Self-Realization and that has to happen.

559
01:05:03,303 --> 01:05:05,982
Then there is a balance automatically achieved,

560
01:05:06,143 --> 01:05:08,023
you don’t have to do anything about it.

561
01:05:08,263 --> 01:05:10,863
In the beginning also

562
01:05:11,023 --> 01:05:14,463
you may have to work. I wouldn’t say, but many people

563
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:17,823
I have seen, they just get Realization and are there.

564
01:05:18,063 --> 01:05:20,023
So this is the first state where you reach

565
01:05:20,223 --> 01:05:23,703
what we call the thoughtless awareness.

566
01:05:23,903 --> 01:05:25,903
And then the second is Nirvikalpa,

567
01:05:26,063 --> 01:05:29,943
where you become doubtlessly aware, you become an expert.

568
01:05:30,103 --> 01:05:35,423
You don’t have to even talk about it, it can work out.

569
01:05:35,863 --> 01:05:38,103
That’s what is the state we have to achieve.

570
01:05:38,423 --> 01:05:40,743
So you become the source of joy.

571
01:05:40,943 --> 01:05:46,063
Joy is a thing beyond happiness and unhappiness

572
01:05:46,303 --> 01:05:48,703
When the ego is pampered we feel happy,

573
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:51,783
when it is disturbed we feel unhappy.

574
01:05:52,183 --> 01:05:55,263
Joy is beyond happiness and unhappiness.

575
01:05:55,623 --> 01:05:57,103
It has no duality.

576
01:05:57,303 --> 01:06:01,143
It's a state where you are in a joyous state.

577
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:04,823
You watch everything in a joyous state.

578
01:06:04,982 --> 01:06:06,943
Like I went to France and they said,

579
01:06:07,103 --> 01:06:09,063
“Mother, you look so joyous and happy

580
01:06:09,263 --> 01:06:13,983
and the French are not going to be happy about it”. I said “Why?”

581
01:06:14,703 --> 01:06:18,663
"Because they think you are ignorant, you don’t understand.

582
01:06:18,863 --> 01:06:21,343
It’s a shocking state we are in and how can you be joyous?”

583
01:06:21,663 --> 01:06:24,343
They are "the very miserable people",

584
01:06:24,623 --> 01:06:26,343
so I called them “Les Misérables”,

585
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:28,783
as Victor Hugo has described them.

586
01:06:28,982 --> 01:06:30,823
But look at these miserable people,

587
01:06:30,982 --> 01:06:33,743
they have got every fourth house is a brothel,

588
01:06:33,943 --> 01:06:35,982
every tenth house is a pub

589
01:06:36,143 --> 01:06:39,303
and every twelfth house there’s a divorce case.

590
01:06:39,703 --> 01:06:43,663
How can you be happy? You have made all arrangements to be unhappy.

591
01:06:43,982 --> 01:06:48,103
And then you want to take pride in that unhappiness?

592
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,543
You have arranged everything to destroy yourself

593
01:06:51,743 --> 01:06:55,903
and now you are identified with your destruction and happy with it.

594
01:06:56,143 --> 01:06:58,823
But now France is changing, I must tell you.

595
01:06:58,982 --> 01:07:01,303
We have had very good response in France also.

596
01:07:01,463 --> 01:07:05,383
Surprisingly the people in France who were just waiting

597
01:07:05,623 --> 01:07:07,463
for some catastrophe to fall on them,

598
01:07:07,703 --> 01:07:09,623
so that they are all perished now once for all -

599
01:07:09,823 --> 01:07:11,823
that’s the last of it they have been asking for -

600
01:07:11,982 --> 01:07:13,343
are so much changed.

601
01:07:13,623 --> 01:07:17,783
Even the people in Switzerland, Sweden and Norway

602
01:07:17,982 --> 01:07:21,463
where they are so affluent and planning to commit suicides,

603
01:07:21,703 --> 01:07:23,983
morning till evening, they have changed.

604
01:07:24,183 --> 01:07:26,463
Everywhere there’s a big change I find.

605
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:29,583
But the best country that I find in the Western world,

606
01:07:29,783 --> 01:07:33,583
or the westernized world, is your country, Australia.

607
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:38,743
Australia is the great country where the Ayers Rock is there

608
01:07:38,943 --> 01:07:42,343
which represents this center.

609
01:07:42,623 --> 01:07:45,463
Now when I say that, you are not to believe Me also.

610
01:07:45,703 --> 01:07:48,383
When you get your Realization, you can ask the question:

611
01:07:48,623 --> 01:07:50,423
“Is Australia the Mooladhara?

612
01:07:50,663 --> 01:07:55,543
Is this the support of the roots? Is it the one?”

613
01:07:55,743 --> 01:07:58,183
And you’ll be amazed that you’ll get tremendous vibrations,

614
01:07:58,383 --> 01:07:59,263
that’s a fact.

615
01:07:59,463 --> 01:08:02,703
Whatever you may try, whatever you may do, you are that

616
01:08:02,903 --> 01:08:05,183
and that’s why I bow to you all.

617
01:08:05,383 --> 01:08:09,463
Today is the last day I’m here. It’s a short time I’ve been here.

618
01:08:09,703 --> 01:08:11,823
But hope to see you again on Wednesday.

619
01:08:11,982 --> 01:08:14,743
They want to have some sort of a workshop for you.

620
01:08:14,943 --> 01:08:16,983
I`ve made it a point, to stay back on Wednesday,

621
01:08:17,183 --> 01:08:18,823
to see you all there.

622
01:08:18,982 --> 01:08:21,623
Whatever problems you have, I will deal with it.

623
01:08:21,823 --> 01:08:23,623
Now somebody has asked a question,

624
01:08:23,823 --> 01:08:28,983
“Are we primitive still as when the floods were there?”

625
01:08:29,183 --> 01:08:33,982
So we are not. We are very conscious,

626
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:37,383
we are conscious of our society, conscious of our world,

627
01:08:37,623 --> 01:08:40,983
and once you become the light, you change the whole world

628
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:43,943
because Sahaja Yoga is not an individual thing.

629
01:08:44,103 --> 01:08:47,183
It is a collective happening, it’s a collective happening.

630
01:08:47,383 --> 01:08:50,823
and it is facing towards the society,

631
01:08:50,982 --> 01:08:54,743
facing towards the world, the universe, at large.

632
01:08:54,943 --> 01:08:59,303
So to say that we are at the same state is not true,

633
01:08:59,623 --> 01:09:02,143
because whatever we have achieved through science,

634
01:09:02,343 --> 01:09:04,063
is also of great use.

635
01:09:04,263 --> 01:09:06,823
For example, now if this was not available

636
01:09:06,982 --> 01:09:09,982
I could not have talked to you all, in such a big way.

637
01:09:10,143 --> 01:09:11,543
If there was no television

638
01:09:11,743 --> 01:09:13,623
- on the television I can give Realization to people

639
01:09:13,823 --> 01:09:15,303
if they give me a chance.

640
01:09:15,463 --> 01:09:17,703
I can give to thousands of them Realization,

641
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:20,663
if they give me a chance. But it`s rather difficult to get there.

642
01:09:20,863 --> 01:09:25,063
Now these photographs also have got vibrations, most surprising.

643
01:09:25,263 --> 01:09:29,663
I’ve seen that there are some photographs where people have taken,

644
01:09:29,863 --> 01:09:32,823
photographs, which they could not see the light coming on My head,

645
01:09:32,982 --> 01:09:36,103
the light coming through My hands, light coming through My feet,

646
01:09:36,303 --> 01:09:38,223
all those things they have taken photographs.

647
01:09:38,423 --> 01:09:40,463
So your camera is also showing it.

648
01:09:40,703 --> 01:09:43,463
Television is the best way we can spread Sahaja Yoga,

649
01:09:43,703 --> 01:09:47,143
if they help out us a little bit, have some faith in Sahaja Yoga.

650
01:09:47,343 --> 01:09:48,823
I’m sure it will grow one day

651
01:09:48,983 --> 01:09:51,063
and we’ll be able to work out through television.

652
01:09:51,263 --> 01:09:55,303
So nothing is going to be wasted,

653
01:09:55,463 --> 01:09:57,663
least of all the human beings.

654
01:09:57,863 --> 01:09:59,583
But we must know their purpose.

655
01:09:59,783 --> 01:10:03,223
The life has no purpose without Self Realization.

656
01:10:03,743 --> 01:10:06,383
After Self Realization it is so purposeful,

657
01:10:06,623 --> 01:10:08,143
full of love enjoyment,

658
01:10:08,343 --> 01:10:12,903
full of love giving and you know your worth and value after that.

659
01:10:13,623 --> 01:10:18,063
The question was, second one was rather patterning to Yogananda.

660
01:10:18,343 --> 01:10:20,383
I’d better not say much about this gentleman

661
01:10:20,623 --> 01:10:22,583
because I’m really angry with him.

662
01:10:22,783 --> 01:10:24,943
He cut the tongues of people

663
01:10:25,103 --> 01:10:28,743
nd there are many people you find in Los Angeles who cannot talk.

664
01:10:28,943 --> 01:10:31,663
They have bagging tongues, like dogs they are moving.

665
01:10:31,863 --> 01:10:34,623
This horrible fellow Yogananda, I don’t know what is he up to.

666
01:10:34,823 --> 01:10:36,783
And he said that you have to do the kechari,

667
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:39,663
is a kind of a thing where you pull your tongue back here

668
01:10:39,863 --> 01:10:43,103
and that’s how he said the Kundalini will rise. It's absurd!

669
01:10:43,663 --> 01:10:46,543
Because when the Kundalini rises by itself,

670
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:49,143
as a result of that some things happen within you.

671
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:51,703
After all rising of the Kundalini takes place,

672
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:55,303
something living thing has to happen like a digestive juices

673
01:10:55,623 --> 01:10:58,982
are poured when you take something to be digestive.

674
01:10:59,143 --> 01:11:02,023
In the same way, when the Kundalini rises, there are bandhans, means

675
01:11:02,223 --> 01:11:04,663
the things to hold the Kundalini, to push it forward

676
01:11:04,863 --> 01:11:07,383
and then also this is a little bit sucked in, no doubt,

677
01:11:07,623 --> 01:11:09,463
but you don’t feel anything.

678
01:11:09,863 --> 01:11:11,383
Is an automatic happening.

679
01:11:11,623 --> 01:11:14,863
Like a car starts, starts moving, the wheels also move,

680
01:11:15,023 --> 01:11:16,903
but if you take out the wheel and start moving it,

681
01:11:17,063 --> 01:11:18,823
will the car move?

682
01:11:18,982 --> 01:11:22,303
And this absolutely an absurd thing called Kriya Yoga.

683
01:11:22,663 --> 01:11:26,143
Sahaja Yoga is a-kriya. There’s nothing to be done, effortless.

684
01:11:26,343 --> 01:11:28,783
Automatically the living process takes place.

685
01:11:28,982 --> 01:11:30,943
Supposing you have to sprout a seed

686
01:11:31,103 --> 01:11:34,383
and you take out the primule and pull it out, will it sprout?

687
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:39,863
It’s a living process, let it happen spontaneously, Sahaja.

688
01:11:40,023 --> 01:11:43,982
So this kind of a thing that is preached, is absolutely nonsensical.

689
01:11:44,263 --> 01:11:46,303
This horrible thing he has done

690
01:11:46,463 --> 01:11:48,463
is to take out the tongues of people.

691
01:11:48,703 --> 01:11:49,903
They still exist.

692
01:11:50,063 --> 01:11:52,703
They still exist these people, they cannot talk,

693
01:11:52,903 --> 01:11:54,103
their tongues are bagging.

694
01:11:54,303 --> 01:11:57,103
He’s made a big money, that another lady of his has made big money.

695
01:11:57,303 --> 01:11:58,943
She has made big money.

696
01:11:59,103 --> 01:12:02,943
So it has nothing to do with God. It's horrible.

697
01:12:03,103 --> 01:12:04,743
It's something, [sadist thing].

698
01:12:04,943 --> 01:12:06,823
Some people make you suffer so much,

699
01:12:06,982 --> 01:12:09,863
they make you give a food like somebody told Me,

700
01:12:10,023 --> 01:12:13,663
they paid six thousand pounds to go to Switzerland,

701
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:16,463
to fly in the air, six thousands pounds!

702
01:12:16,703 --> 01:12:18,903
And they were given for 6 days the water

703
01:12:19,063 --> 01:12:21,863
in which they had boiled potatoes, six days!

704
01:12:22,023 --> 01:12:23,983
And the seventh day the rind of the potatoes

705
01:12:24,183 --> 01:12:25,583
for six thousand pounds.

706
01:12:25,783 --> 01:12:28,903
And the last day they gave them the potatoes.

707
01:12:29,063 --> 01:12:31,663
The people became so week, so possessed.

708
01:12:31,863 --> 01:12:33,023
I’ve seen some of them,

709
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:37,023
they are even afraid of looking at a garlic, can you believe it?

710
01:12:37,223 --> 01:12:40,463
They are afraid of garlics, they are afraid of lemons.

711
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:43,383
Such people, such recluses have been created!

712
01:12:43,783 --> 01:12:46,103
How can that be anything to do with God?

713
01:12:46,343 --> 01:12:49,863
For a while, of course, you get possessed so you get more excited,

714
01:12:50,023 --> 01:12:51,783
little bit happens to you.

715
01:12:51,982 --> 01:12:53,583
But that’s not a permanent affair.

716
01:12:53,783 --> 01:12:57,983
If you go and see, those disciples after 5-6 years will be lost.

717
01:12:58,183 --> 01:12:59,303
You cannot find them.

718
01:12:59,463 --> 01:13:02,063
Where are they, these doctors and these great people?

719
01:13:02,263 --> 01:13:04,143
They are mostly in the lunatic asylum,

720
01:13:04,343 --> 01:13:06,143
or they are suffering from epilepsy.

721
01:13:06,343 --> 01:13:08,143
I’ve seen people of that kind.

722
01:13:08,343 --> 01:13:14,063
In Scotland there was a Flying Academy, where the people were sent.

723
01:13:14,263 --> 01:13:17,303
The owner of that academy, his wife and his child

724
01:13:17,623 --> 01:13:19,583
the wife was the granddaughter of a duke,

725
01:13:19,783 --> 01:13:21,903
the gentleman was a diamond merchant

726
01:13:22,063 --> 01:13:23,583
all of them became bankrupt,

727
01:13:23,783 --> 01:13:27,143
they came to Me with epilepsy of a very serious type.

728
01:13:27,343 --> 01:13:30,383
very serious type. They got cured, but the fellow became bankrupt,

729
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:33,263
so he had to go back to South Africa,

730
01:13:33,463 --> 01:13:37,303
The wife is there, she is now in India and the child is all right.

731
01:13:37,463 --> 01:13:40,223
This is the situation. How can you become epileptic,

732
01:13:40,423 --> 01:13:42,623
how can you have problems, going to God?

733
01:13:42,823 --> 01:13:45,623
You have to improve, your condition must improve.

734
01:13:45,823 --> 01:13:47,383
But still people stick on,

735
01:13:47,703 --> 01:13:50,823
because there's a kind of mesmerism I think,

736
01:13:50,982 --> 01:13:53,423
or a kind of a conditioning on their heads

737
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:56,982
or they think, “We have paid the money so let us go through it!”

738
01:13:57,343 --> 01:14:01,063
Better not, better be considerate, kind to yourself.

739
01:14:01,263 --> 01:14:04,583
This body, this mind, this human frame,

740
01:14:04,783 --> 01:14:06,823
all this is made with great difficulty.

741
01:14:06,982 --> 01:14:09,343
Please do not waste it, please respect it,

742
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:13,983
understand that no use identifying yourself

743
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:18,423
with something which is false, fake, injurious and troublesome.

744
01:14:18,823 --> 01:14:22,743
Better get to something that is your own! I would say, be selfish.

745
01:14:22,943 --> 01:14:25,743
In Sanskrit it is called the word swarth,

746
01:14:25,982 --> 01:14:28,663
You see the Sanskrit’s callers were very clever.

747
01:14:28,863 --> 01:14:31,663
So selfishness is called as swarth meaning the,

748
01:14:31,863 --> 01:14:34,343
swarth means the meaning of the swa.

749
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,543
Swa means the Self.

750
01:14:35,743 --> 01:14:39,063
You find out the meaning of the Self is the selfishness.

751
01:14:39,383 --> 01:14:43,343
That’s the best, is to find out the meaning of the Self.

752
01:14:43,623 --> 01:14:46,303
So if you become selfish, you better become the Self.

753
01:14:46,703 --> 01:14:48,543
That’s the best way to look at it.

754
01:14:48,743 --> 01:14:51,223
I’m sorry, so many of these Indian horrible people,

755
01:14:51,423 --> 01:14:53,663
came here and have exploited you.

756
01:14:53,863 --> 01:14:55,903
I really am sorry but you are so naive.

757
01:14:56,063 --> 01:14:57,982
They could not do anything in India,

758
01:14:58,143 --> 01:14:59,823
because people traditionally know.

759
01:14:59,982 --> 01:15:03,783
That’s why they are here, they could not befool us, they could not.

760
01:15:03,982 --> 01:15:06,823
We know them very well, we know all this kind very well.

761
01:15:06,982 --> 01:15:10,303
So they had to come down here to exploit you and trouble you.

762
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:13,143
So I’m sorry for that, I’m very sorry,

763
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:16,943
but now at least you take to right thinking and understanding,

764
01:15:17,103 --> 01:15:20,023
that you cannot pay for it, you cannot putting any effort,

765
01:15:20,223 --> 01:15:22,743
it’s a living process of your evolution.

766
01:15:22,943 --> 01:15:25,463
Just understand that and it will work out.

767
01:15:25,703 --> 01:15:27,063
I am sure it will work out.

768
01:15:27,263 --> 01:15:28,982
I hope you’ll make it convenient

769
01:15:29,143 --> 01:15:32,023
to come to the workshop they are going to have,

770
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,743
where I’ll deal with you personally.

771
01:15:34,943 --> 01:15:37,183
The other question was about Yoga.

772
01:15:37,383 --> 01:15:40,823
What about Yoga? The Yoga you know is a wee bit of exercises,

773
01:15:40,982 --> 01:15:43,543
is not Yoga. Yoga means union with the Divine.

774
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,943
And they use to do this thousands of years back,

775
01:15:46,103 --> 01:15:47,663
in a very different system.

776
01:15:47,863 --> 01:15:50,703
But now we too do certain exercises

777
01:15:50,903 --> 01:15:52,823
but according to the Kundalini rising.

778
01:15:52,983 --> 01:15:55,383
Even in Patanjali Yoga if you read the whole book

779
01:15:55,623 --> 01:15:56,583
which people do not read.

780
01:15:56,783 --> 01:15:59,063
They get it from some third, forth hand knowledge.

781
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:02,903
If you read it, it is, yoga means not the exercises,

782
01:16:03,063 --> 01:16:04,703
but when the Kundalini is rising

783
01:16:04,903 --> 01:16:08,063
and whatever is the chakra catching, if there’s a physical problem,

784
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:10,463
then you have to do a particular asanas

785
01:16:10,703 --> 01:16:12,943
or a particular type of an exercise

786
01:16:13,103 --> 01:16:16,423
which is related, which is absolutely particular

787
01:16:16,663 --> 01:16:18,343
to that particular chakras.

788
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:21,103
So just to do indiscriminate asanas

789
01:16:21,303 --> 01:16:23,543
is very dangerous especially for heart,

790
01:16:23,743 --> 01:16:27,063
is a very dangerous thing to do indiscriminate asanas,

791
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:30,023
because one can get troubles of the heart.

792
01:16:30,223 --> 01:16:33,063
So it is better to understand the whole science behind it

793
01:16:33,263 --> 01:16:38,343
There’s a big science of mantras also, science of these asanas.

794
01:16:38,663 --> 01:16:42,303
Without doing it you are taking the medicine indiscriminately,

795
01:16:42,463 --> 01:16:44,663
of the whole of the medicine box.

796
01:16:44,863 --> 01:16:46,543
It’s like that without understanding.

797
01:16:46,743 --> 01:16:49,023
So be careful, respect your body,

798
01:16:49,223 --> 01:16:51,982
respect your being! That’s what I have to say as a Mother.

799
01:16:52,143 --> 01:16:54,743
May God bless you all!

800
01:17:08,143 --> 01:17:10,183
So now if there are any more questions,

801
01:17:10,383 --> 01:17:12,983
you can write them down and give it to them.

802
01:17:13,183 --> 01:17:17,343
Next time when I have the,

803
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:19,423
S.M.: Wednesday we are having.
SY: I`ve told them.

804
01:17:19,703 --> 01:17:23,823
S.M.: Yes, then I will answer these questions in person.

805
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:36,223
But as I told you it’s not a mental projection, it’s a happening.

806
01:17:36,463 --> 01:17:38,903
It’s a happening, it should happen to all of you

807
01:17:39,063 --> 01:17:40,743
but there’s no guarantee.

808
01:17:40,943 --> 01:17:44,103
Most of you get it, some of you may not, doesn’t matter.

809
01:17:44,303 --> 01:17:48,343
If not today, tomorrow everyone gets it, that’s the point.

810
01:17:48,823 --> 01:17:52,063
Some people have some problems, some barriers,

811
01:17:52,703 --> 01:17:57,263
something wrong, but very few of them. Most of them get Realization.

812
01:17:57,623 --> 01:17:59,943
So you should not get disappointed.

813
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,583
To start with, we have to understand

814
01:18:05,783 --> 01:18:09,863
that these centers are made of different elements,

815
01:18:10,103 --> 01:18:14,663
the essences of the elements, as we call them, the causal,

816
01:18:14,863 --> 01:18:16,183
the causal of the elements.

817
01:18:16,383 --> 01:18:21,143
And now as I told you that the triangular bone

818
01:18:21,343 --> 01:18:24,703
is made out of the earth element.

819
01:18:24,903 --> 01:18:27,343
we have to take the advantage of the earth element,

820
01:18:27,663 --> 01:18:31,463
we have to take the advantage of all the elements.

821
01:18:31,743 --> 01:18:35,303
And that you will learn gradually how you take advantage of that.

822
01:18:35,623 --> 01:18:37,863
When these elements are in proper proportions

823
01:18:38,023 --> 01:18:41,183
and in proper balance you never have any problem.

824
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,383
But when they get disturbed and upset,

825
01:18:43,623 --> 01:18:46,423
then only you start getting the problem.

826
01:18:46,703 --> 01:18:49,863
He has already told you how things are caused in trouble.

827
01:18:50,023 --> 01:18:51,303
I will only explain to you

828
01:18:51,463 --> 01:18:54,343
how cancer is caused because that’s very important.

829
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:58,183
Also AIDS, AIDS and things which are very incurable

830
01:18:58,383 --> 01:19:01,063
and people are frightened of them.

831
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:05,463
It's very simple to understand that supposing this is a center

832
01:19:05,743 --> 01:19:07,863
and this is the left side and this is the right side,

833
01:19:08,023 --> 01:19:10,623
I hope all of you can see this very clearly.

834
01:19:10,823 --> 01:19:13,982
Now what happens that when there is

835
01:19:14,143 --> 01:19:16,943
too much activity on the left side or the right side.

836
01:19:17,103 --> 01:19:20,983
even right side when a person is very futuristic and all that.

837
01:19:21,183 --> 01:19:23,903
Then what happens that you become vulnerable

838
01:19:24,063 --> 01:19:25,863
to cancer, you become vulnerable.

839
01:19:26,023 --> 01:19:29,063
But the triggering as the doctor say, takes place

840
01:19:29,263 --> 01:19:33,863
by some proteins they call as protein 58, protein 52.

841
01:19:34,063 --> 01:19:36,023
That’s just like doctors, when they don’t know the names

842
01:19:36,223 --> 01:19:40,463
they just give them numbers like criminals, number 52, 58.

843
01:19:40,982 --> 01:19:46,303
But these they say so, clearly, that come from the areas,

844
01:19:46,463 --> 01:19:49,463
built within us since our creation.

845
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:51,663
So it is the collective subconscious

846
01:19:51,863 --> 01:19:56,063
which exists on the left hand side, beyond the subconscious mind,

847
01:19:56,863 --> 01:19:58,743
beyond the subconscious mind.

848
01:19:58,943 --> 01:20:02,063
Now from this you will realize that this subconscious mind

849
01:20:02,263 --> 01:20:04,982
is placed next to this blue line

850
01:20:05,143 --> 01:20:07,903
and then the collective subconscious.

851
01:20:08,063 --> 01:20:10,343
On the right hand side, the supraconscious mind

852
01:20:10,663 --> 01:20:13,343
and then the collective supraconscious mind.

853
01:20:13,623 --> 01:20:17,623
So the people who die, with conditioning and all that,

854
01:20:17,823 --> 01:20:23,743
and still wanting to exist as spirits, can exist in that area.

855
01:20:23,943 --> 01:20:30,383
Whatever has gone out of the circulation of our evolution,

856
01:20:30,783 --> 01:20:35,703
rests in that area which is built within us since our creation.

857
01:20:35,943 --> 01:20:39,903
So viruses are caused by the plants

858
01:20:40,063 --> 01:20:42,863
or we can say microscopic animals

859
01:20:43,023 --> 01:20:45,223
which are thrown out

860
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:51,343
of the circulation of our evolution.

861
01:20:51,743 --> 01:20:54,982
In the same way there are spirits - as Christians we know

862
01:20:55,143 --> 01:20:57,303
Christ took out the spirits and put them in the pigs -

863
01:20:57,623 --> 01:21:03,983
so the spirits that are the dead spirits of people,

864
01:21:04,183 --> 01:21:10,703
who have not yet accepted that they are to leave this world,

865
01:21:10,903 --> 01:21:14,743
and are still busy hanging around, such people are there.

866
01:21:14,943 --> 01:21:17,982
And these are the people used by most of these gurus

867
01:21:18,143 --> 01:21:19,863
when they mesmerize you.

868
01:21:20,023 --> 01:21:24,903
Once they mesmerize you, you are drawn more towards the left side,

869
01:21:25,103 --> 01:21:29,343
towards the left collective subconscious.

870
01:21:29,623 --> 01:21:33,583
And when you go to the collective subconscious, that’s the area

871
01:21:33,783 --> 01:21:35,783
from where this triggering takes place.

872
01:21:35,982 --> 01:21:40,143
So too much of activity already it is sort of getting dislocated.

873
01:21:40,343 --> 01:21:43,343
So the relationship with the whole is not there.

874
01:21:43,703 --> 01:21:47,103
When the relationship of the whole is just precariously placed,

875
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:49,983
this trigger out and you just move out.

876
01:21:50,183 --> 01:21:53,943
Then in this area all the cells, on this area maybe,

877
01:21:54,103 --> 01:21:57,143
all the cells that are there become on their own,

878
01:21:57,343 --> 01:22:01,583
means that they become arbitrary, they start attacking each other,

879
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,743
we call it they become malignant.

880
01:22:03,943 --> 01:22:05,623
This is how cancer is settling.

881
01:22:05,823 --> 01:22:07,343
Now what happens to the Kundalini?

882
01:22:07,623 --> 01:22:11,943
When Kundalini rises, she tries to bring them together.

883
01:22:12,103 --> 01:22:15,423
Now here she awakens the deity there,

884
01:22:15,663 --> 01:22:19,143
by which the flow starts and it is kept intact.

885
01:22:19,343 --> 01:22:23,023
Apart from that she gets you connected with the source,

886
01:22:23,223 --> 01:22:26,543
so all the time that energy is flowing within you,

887
01:22:26,743 --> 01:22:29,463
so you do not get any diseases of that kind.

888
01:22:29,743 --> 01:22:33,303
Same thing with AIDS. At the lower, lowest one.

889
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:37,463
This one, with the, it is combined with some other chakra,

890
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:38,903
this thing takes place.

891
01:22:39,063 --> 01:22:42,543
I've seen as commonly done by this chakra, on the left hand side.

892
01:22:42,743 --> 01:22:46,103
When by some means, you do something very perverted,

893
01:22:46,303 --> 01:22:48,143
and go to the left side,

894
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:50,583
go to the left side too much,

895
01:22:50,783 --> 01:22:52,863
then you get attacked by these things.

896
01:22:53,023 --> 01:22:56,663
So AIDS can be cured very easily through Sahaja Yoga.

897
01:22:56,863 --> 01:22:59,343
But after curing you,

898
01:22:59,663 --> 01:23:02,103
if you go to the same thing and do it again and again,

899
01:23:02,303 --> 01:23:04,463
then again you get back to the same state.

900
01:23:04,783 --> 01:23:06,983
By bringing you in the center, you get cured.

901
01:23:07,183 --> 01:23:08,943
But if you try to go back again,

902
01:23:09,103 --> 01:23:11,543
to the same side, on the left hand side, you get it.

903
01:23:11,743 --> 01:23:14,303
The right side diseases, as he has described to you,

904
01:23:14,463 --> 01:23:16,743
are like the liver trouble,

905
01:23:16,943 --> 01:23:20,703
which is active liver, you can get cirrhoses of liver, jaundice,

906
01:23:20,903 --> 01:23:24,223
you can get with
that right sidedness

907
01:23:24,423 --> 01:23:26,623
what you call, the diabetes,

908
01:23:26,823 --> 01:23:31,343
also the hectic life gives you what we call the blood cancer.

909
01:23:31,623 --> 01:23:33,623
If the mother is hectic, father is hectic,

910
01:23:33,823 --> 01:23:35,703
if the family is hectic by temperament,

911
01:23:35,903 --> 01:23:37,982
the child can get blood cancer.

912
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:41,943
These all can be cured through Sahaja Yoga, in a proper state.

913
01:23:42,103 --> 01:23:43,983
But if it is absolutely a gone case,

914
01:23:44,183 --> 01:23:45,663
we do not bother about it,

915
01:23:45,863 --> 01:23:48,303
but we think let the person be born again

916
01:23:48,463 --> 01:23:51,103
so that we can give him Realization properly.

917
01:23:51,303 --> 01:23:53,343
So the object of Sahaja Yoga

918
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:56,663
is not to fight the diseases, but to create doctors

919
01:23:56,863 --> 01:23:59,903
to create people who are healthy, who can give light to others.

920
01:24:00,063 --> 01:24:01,663
It’s common sense.

921
01:24:01,982 --> 01:24:07,183
The lamp which is going to give no light, we do not repair it.

922
01:24:07,383 --> 01:24:09,343
In the same way the personality

923
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:13,143
that is not going to give any more light is not repaired.

924
01:24:13,343 --> 01:24:15,143
And that’s why you have to learn

925
01:24:15,343 --> 01:24:17,982
that you get cured because you have to give the light.

926
01:24:18,143 --> 01:24:21,183
This is very important and I have seen wherever it has failed,

927
01:24:21,383 --> 01:24:24,183
people have again gone back to their own same diseases.

928
01:24:24,623 --> 01:24:29,783
This is what is Sahaja Yoga. It's so simple and so benevolent.

929
01:24:30,423 --> 01:24:33,983
So now, to have the experience of the Spirit,

930
01:24:34,183 --> 01:24:36,063
I will request you to take out your shoes,

931
01:24:36,263 --> 01:24:39,583
to touch the Mother Earth, first of all.

932
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,263
It will take about 10 minutes

933
01:24:49,463 --> 01:24:52,943
for you to get your Realization, not more than that.

934
01:24:53,823 --> 01:24:57,423
What’s the matter with this gentleman?

935
01:24:57,663 --> 01:24:58,823
What is he talking?

936
01:24:58,982 --> 01:25:01,463
P: I said, why You divert God's word?

937
01:25:01,743 --> 01:25:05,263
What is he saying?
SY: We don’t need this.

938
01:25:08,943 --> 01:25:11,982
SY: Just don’t, don’t respond him.

939
01:25:12,143 --> 01:25:14,903
SM: Better take him out.

940
01:25:19,063 --> 01:25:20,223
Look at that now!

941
01:25:20,423 --> 01:25:24,263
He must be belonging to some church or something else.

942
01:25:25,982 --> 01:25:27,943
SY: Please ask him to go!

943
01:25:28,103 --> 01:25:32,903
SM: He must be drunk, must be drunk. Don’t be harsh, don’t be harsh!

944
01:25:39,223 --> 01:25:41,903
He must be drunk, just forget it!

945
01:25:43,703 --> 01:25:46,903
Perhaps you see so many of them on the street also,

946
01:25:47,063 --> 01:25:48,223
like that talking.

947
01:25:48,423 --> 01:25:50,982
But they disturb, they disturb, that’s the main point is.

948
01:25:51,143 --> 01:25:52,823
Don’t get disturb with it!

949
01:25:52,983 --> 01:25:54,903
I don’t know what he was talking about,

950
01:25:55,063 --> 01:25:57,623
but there’s no need to be aggressive, I mean I don’t know.

951
01:25:57,823 --> 01:26:00,183
I didn’t say anything.

952
01:26:02,663 --> 01:26:04,943
Let us settle down with our peace.

953
01:26:05,143 --> 01:26:09,063
We have to all get our Realization. We are sensible, wise people.

954
01:26:09,383 --> 01:26:12,982
Put your feet please on the Mother Earth.

955
01:26:13,943 --> 01:26:18,703
There is very least to be done, very least.

956
01:26:18,903 --> 01:26:23,343
We don’t want you to give up anything before Sahaja Yoga,

957
01:26:23,703 --> 01:26:27,623
because you just - we are not told, "Don’t do this, don’t do that".

958
01:26:27,863 --> 01:26:30,583
It just works out within you, you become that,

959
01:26:30,783 --> 01:26:34,023
you become a personality of virtues, of righteousness.

960
01:26:34,223 --> 01:26:36,143
I don’t have to tell you.

961
01:26:36,343 --> 01:26:39,663
We didn’t have to tell Christ not to do bad things, isn’t it?

962
01:26:39,863 --> 01:26:42,143
Because He was a realized soul, He was a great soul.

963
01:26:42,343 --> 01:26:44,023
In the same way when you become that

964
01:26:44,223 --> 01:26:46,703
you are not to be told "Don’t do this, don’t do that".

965
01:26:46,903 --> 01:26:49,943
But you have to be a Realized Soul, that’s important.

966
01:26:50,463 --> 01:26:52,982
So it’s very little to be done,

967
01:26:53,143 --> 01:26:57,623
not much is to be done about it, it's very simple.

968
01:26:58,023 --> 01:27:00,623
Only thing I would request you, to take out your spectacles

969
01:27:00,823 --> 01:27:03,703
because it improves your eyesight also.

970
01:27:04,023 --> 01:27:06,783
Just it’s a very little thing to do.

971
01:27:06,982 --> 01:27:09,982
Now put your both hands

972
01:27:10,143 --> 01:27:13,143
in this way, on your lap, in a very simple way.

973
01:27:13,343 --> 01:27:15,023
Both the hands like this on your lap.

974
01:27:15,223 --> 01:27:17,783
Just like this, on your lap, comfortable.

975
01:27:18,183 --> 01:27:20,943
There’s one more thing, if there’s anything uncomfortable,

976
01:27:21,103 --> 01:27:23,823
you feel uncomfortable with, you better remove it.

977
01:27:23,982 --> 01:27:26,183
Some people might be wearing coats or something,

978
01:27:26,383 --> 01:27:28,583
feeling uncomfortable, please remove it.

979
01:27:28,783 --> 01:27:32,023
Now please put both hands like this, just like this.

980
01:27:32,623 --> 01:27:34,863
SY: On your lap, on the lap.

981
01:27:35,623 --> 01:27:38,863
And there’s nothing to be serious, of course nothing frivolous also.

982
01:27:39,023 --> 01:27:42,303
But it is something you must know of serenity,

983
01:27:42,463 --> 01:27:44,943
of joy and of pleasant temperament.

984
01:27:45,183 --> 01:27:47,623
You have to be pleasantly posted towards it.

985
01:27:47,823 --> 01:27:50,982
Because you are going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

986
01:27:51,623 --> 01:27:52,943
You are going to enter there.

987
01:27:53,103 --> 01:27:55,983
So it’s a very pleasant thing which you have being seeking for ages,

988
01:27:56,183 --> 01:27:57,703
which is going to happen to you,

989
01:27:57,903 --> 01:28:00,863
so you must have that expectation and that joy

990
01:28:01,023 --> 01:28:05,703
or that kind of a temperament, very pleasant,

991
01:28:05,903 --> 01:28:11,343
as if you are now on your way to your salvation.

992
01:28:11,943 --> 01:28:15,823
So put your left hand towards Me

993
01:28:15,982 --> 01:28:17,983
that means this is the desire

994
01:28:18,183 --> 01:28:20,982
that you have, that you want to get your Realization.

995
01:28:21,143 --> 01:28:23,463
And the right hand on your heart.

996
01:28:23,743 --> 01:28:27,743
Because in the heart as I told you resides the Spirit.

997
01:28:27,982 --> 01:28:31,183
Now only I’ll show you beforehand, before you close your eyes

998
01:28:31,423 --> 01:28:33,423
what are the chakras we are going to tackle

999
01:28:33,663 --> 01:28:36,183
and how you are going to raise your Kundalini,

1000
01:28:36,383 --> 01:28:38,463
awaken your Kundalini, not Me.

1001
01:28:39,023 --> 01:28:40,903
So I’m going to tell you what is to be done

1002
01:28:41,063 --> 01:28:42,383
and later on we’ll do it.

1003
01:28:42,623 --> 01:28:45,583
But just now I’ll just show you, that first on the heart,

1004
01:28:45,783 --> 01:28:48,023
then in the upper part of the abdomen,

1005
01:28:48,223 --> 01:28:51,343
on the left hand side, everything on the left hand side.

1006
01:28:51,663 --> 01:28:53,783
Then in the lower part of the abdomen,

1007
01:28:53,982 --> 01:28:56,583
then you go back to the upper part of the abdomen,

1008
01:28:56,783 --> 01:28:58,383
then you go to the heart again,

1009
01:28:58,623 --> 01:29:03,463
then you go here on the corner

1010
01:29:03,743 --> 01:29:06,623
of the neck and the shoulder,

1011
01:29:06,823 --> 01:29:09,023
then you go on top of your head here

1012
01:29:09,223 --> 01:29:12,663
across like this or say, on your forehead.

1013
01:29:12,863 --> 01:29:15,663
And then you go at the back, here,

1014
01:29:15,863 --> 01:29:18,063
on the optic lobe, holding the optic lobe,

1015
01:29:18,263 --> 01:29:22,943
then here your palm going on top of your fontanelle bone area,

1016
01:29:23,103 --> 01:29:26,063
which was a soft bone on top of your head

1017
01:29:26,263 --> 01:29:27,983
and you have to move it seven times

1018
01:29:28,183 --> 01:29:30,943
which I’ll tell you clearly later on.

1019
01:29:31,103 --> 01:29:33,823
Now, please close your eyes.

1020
01:29:34,383 --> 01:29:35,903
At the very outset,

1021
01:29:36,063 --> 01:29:39,463
I have to make a very, very humble request to you,

1022
01:29:39,703 --> 01:29:41,703
"Do not feel guilty!"

1023
01:29:41,982 --> 01:29:46,823
Please do not feel guilty! If you feel guilty

1024
01:29:46,982 --> 01:29:52,343
then it is difficult to achieve Realization.

1025
01:29:53,943 --> 01:29:57,863
After all, as I told you, you are a special category.

1026
01:29:58,223 --> 01:30:01,343
Forgive yourself, you have done nothing wrong

1027
01:30:01,583 --> 01:30:05,343
and God is the ocean of forgiveness.

1028
01:30:05,823 --> 01:30:07,943
He is the one who can forgive everything.

1029
01:30:08,183 --> 01:30:10,383
So please, first of all forgive yourself

1030
01:30:10,623 --> 01:30:13,023
and say in your heart that you are not at all guilty.

1031
01:30:13,223 --> 01:30:16,063
Because that is the biggest hurdle, in the West countries I've seen.

1032
01:30:16,263 --> 01:30:19,103
Westernized people, they have a fashion to feel guilty

1033
01:30:19,303 --> 01:30:23,383
for every small, every big, every sort of a nonsense thing.

1034
01:30:23,623 --> 01:30:25,143
So not to feel guilty at all.

1035
01:30:25,343 --> 01:30:26,983
So in a pleasant mood we sit down,

1036
01:30:27,183 --> 01:30:30,143
forgiving ourselves, not thinking bad about ourselves.

1037
01:30:30,343 --> 01:30:33,623
Becoming miserable, “Les Misérables” we need, need not be.

1038
01:30:33,943 --> 01:30:38,943
So now with the left hand towards Me what we do,

1039
01:30:39,103 --> 01:30:41,583
that we put our right hand on the heart.

1040
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:43,743
Now keep your eyes shut.

1041
01:30:43,943 --> 01:30:46,183
You are not to open your eyes till I tell you,

1042
01:30:46,383 --> 01:30:48,743
because whatever happens is inside.

1043
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:51,463
The attention has to be inside and if your eyes are open,

1044
01:30:51,703 --> 01:30:53,103
the attention goes outside.

1045
01:30:53,303 --> 01:30:55,543
So please don’t open your eyes.

1046
01:30:55,743 --> 01:30:59,623
Put your right hand on your heart.

1047
01:31:00,103 --> 01:31:05,703
Now, in the heart resides your Spirit.

1048
01:31:07,063 --> 01:31:10,943
Please put. Close your eyes, please close your eyes!

1049
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:17,982
Here you have to ask Me a question, from your heart.

1050
01:31:18,623 --> 01:31:20,223
You can call Me, Shri Mataji,

1051
01:31:20,423 --> 01:31:22,863
or you can call Me, Mother, whatever you like.

1052
01:31:23,023 --> 01:31:27,903
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask the question three times.

1053
01:31:29,703 --> 01:31:33,143
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask the question three times.

1054
01:31:33,343 --> 01:31:37,063
Those who got Realization yesterday, should also ask again.

1055
01:31:37,263 --> 01:31:40,303
Is the simple way to reawaken the Kundalini,

1056
01:31:40,463 --> 01:31:43,423
to reestablish it properly.

1057
01:31:49,983 --> 01:31:52,343
The other question that follows with it,

1058
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:54,543
that if you are the Spirit,

1059
01:31:54,743 --> 01:31:56,943
you are your own guide,

1060
01:31:57,103 --> 01:32:01,343
you are your own guru, you are your own master.

1061
01:32:01,863 --> 01:32:04,463
So you put your right hand

1062
01:32:04,703 --> 01:32:08,023
on thie center which is on the left hand side,

1063
01:32:08,223 --> 01:32:13,143
in the upper part of your stomach,

1064
01:32:13,343 --> 01:32:16,303
in the upper part of your abdomen.

1065
01:32:16,943 --> 01:32:20,743
Please put your right hand there and left hand towards Me.

1066
01:32:20,943 --> 01:32:24,223
Now this is a center of mastery.

1067
01:32:24,703 --> 01:32:26,983
So here you have to ask a question to Me,

1068
01:32:27,223 --> 01:32:30,103
“Mother, am I my own master?”

1069
01:32:30,743 --> 01:32:32,783
"Am I my own Guru?” ,

1070
01:32:32,982 --> 01:32:38,823
“Am I my own guide?” Ask a question, please, here, three times.

1071
01:33:01,183 --> 01:33:04,023
Now take down this right hand,

1072
01:33:04,223 --> 01:33:09,423
on the left hand side of your stomach, in the lower region,

1073
01:33:09,943 --> 01:33:11,943
on the lower region and press it.

1074
01:33:12,103 --> 01:33:15,103
Now this is a very-very... Face them.

1075
01:33:15,303 --> 01:33:21,063
This is a very-very important center because through this center,

1076
01:33:21,263 --> 01:33:26,023
we achieve the divine technique, we work out the divine technique.

1077
01:33:26,663 --> 01:33:28,983
That’s the true knowledge, that’s the pure knowledge

1078
01:33:29,183 --> 01:33:30,583
in Sanskrit called Shudha Vidya,

1079
01:33:30,783 --> 01:33:34,663
that’s the true knowledge, the technique, the expertise.

1080
01:33:34,863 --> 01:33:38,143
So for that I cannot force upon you this knowledge.

1081
01:33:38,343 --> 01:33:40,383
You have to say you want it.

1082
01:33:40,623 --> 01:33:45,783
So please say: “Mother, may I have the pure knowledge?”

1083
01:33:45,982 --> 01:33:49,943
“Mother, may I have the true knowledge?” Please ask for it.

1084
01:33:50,103 --> 01:33:52,743
I cannot force it on you, I cannot.

1085
01:33:52,943 --> 01:33:57,703
So please ask for it: “Mother, may I have the pure knowledge,

1086
01:33:57,903 --> 01:34:00,263
the true knowledge?”

1087
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:06,703
Six times, because this center has got six petals.

1088
01:34:17,703 --> 01:34:20,343
SY: It's good. It`s coming.

1089
01:34:20,943 --> 01:34:23,743
SM: Very good.
SY: It`s coming.

1090
01:34:27,383 --> 01:34:30,743
Hold the light for the left hand.

1091
01:34:38,823 --> 01:34:41,583
Please ask six times.

1092
01:34:50,903 --> 01:34:53,063
There's a tension.

1093
01:34:59,063 --> 01:35:01,623
Good?

1094
01:35:03,303 --> 01:35:08,743
Now

1095
01:35:08,943 --> 01:35:13,982
some people are laughing or... Please don’t do that.

1096
01:35:14,143 --> 01:35:16,743
Because it won’t work out in you if you do that.

1097
01:35:16,943 --> 01:35:19,943
It's not a sign of wisdom.

1098
01:35:21,023 --> 01:35:24,023
It's not a sign. Please do not do that way.

1099
01:35:24,223 --> 01:35:30,023
Is uncivil to other people. Try to control. Please try to control.

1100
01:35:38,103 --> 01:35:42,423
Now raise the right hand again

1101
01:35:42,663 --> 01:35:45,143
onto the upper part of the abdomen,

1102
01:35:45,343 --> 01:35:47,903
on the left hand side, upper part.

1103
01:35:48,783 --> 01:35:52,023
This is the center of the master, the guru.

1104
01:35:52,982 --> 01:35:58,343
Here please say with full assertion,

1105
01:35:58,783 --> 01:36:01,463
with full confidence within yourself,

1106
01:36:01,743 --> 01:36:03,303
That is very important

1107
01:36:03,463 --> 01:36:06,863
that you must now show your confidence for the Kundalini to rise,

1108
01:36:07,023 --> 01:36:09,063
because the movement in the Kundalini has started

1109
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:10,823
which you will know very soon.

1110
01:36:10,982 --> 01:36:15,343
So what you have to say, “Mother,

1111
01:36:15,583 --> 01:36:18,423
I am my own master".

1112
01:36:19,103 --> 01:36:23,303
Say with full confidence. “Mother, I am my own master.”

1113
01:36:26,063 --> 01:36:27,183
Ten times,

1114
01:36:27,383 --> 01:36:30,983
because this center has got ten petals, say it ten times.

1115
01:36:32,623 --> 01:36:34,623
“Mother, I am my own master.”

1116
01:36:34,823 --> 01:36:38,743
Please don’t disturb others when they are meditating. Be civil!

1117
01:36:39,343 --> 01:36:41,743
Can wait for ten minutes. Just wait for ten minutes.

1118
01:36:41,943 --> 01:36:43,783
Don’t disturb others.

1119
01:36:45,103 --> 01:36:47,143
There’s something wrong that you cannot do it,

1120
01:36:47,343 --> 01:36:50,383
so please keep quiet. At least keep quiet!

1121
01:36:53,383 --> 01:36:55,743
Please say ten times,

1122
01:36:57,903 --> 01:37:02,663
“Mother, I am my own guru, I am my own guide,

1123
01:37:02,863 --> 01:37:07,263
I am my own master”, with full confidence in yourself.

1124
01:37:17,703 --> 01:37:19,703
Ten times.

1125
01:37:20,703 --> 01:37:24,783
It’s too much on the left, too much of conditioning I think.

1126
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:44,383
Now.

1127
01:37:48,703 --> 01:37:52,463
Please raise your hand now to your heart.

1128
01:37:55,383 --> 01:37:58,183
Now here on this center

1129
01:37:58,383 --> 01:38:03,303
with all confidence in yourself, from your heart,

1130
01:38:03,863 --> 01:38:05,463
you have to assert and say,

1131
01:38:05,703 --> 01:38:08,903
“Mother, I am the Spirit”. Please say that!

1132
01:38:09,823 --> 01:38:13,303
Twelve times. “Mother, I am the Spirit”,

1133
01:38:13,463 --> 01:38:16,343
without any hesitation.

1134
01:38:32,982 --> 01:38:35,463
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

1135
01:38:35,703 --> 01:38:38,943
Twelve times. “Mother, I am the Spirit.” Believe Me, you are!

1136
01:38:39,103 --> 01:38:42,423
We have to just assert for the Kundalini to raise.

1137
01:38:42,703 --> 01:38:46,863
Just assert, “Mother, I am the Spirit”. Please do it.

1138
01:38:50,063 --> 01:38:52,943
It’s very simple, it is.

1139
01:38:53,103 --> 01:38:55,982
You have to have faith in yourself.

1140
01:39:01,783 --> 01:39:04,463
Good, it’s rising very well.

1141
01:39:05,183 --> 01:39:07,983
Good!

1142
01:39:16,703 --> 01:39:18,983
Raise this right hand now

1143
01:39:19,183 --> 01:39:22,982
in the corner of the shoulder and the neck

1144
01:39:23,143 --> 01:39:25,623
on the left hand side, from the front.

1145
01:39:25,943 --> 01:39:30,703
Yes, just hold it tight. This is a very important center,

1146
01:39:30,943 --> 01:39:34,863
which gets spoilt when you feel guilty for nothing at all.

1147
01:39:35,023 --> 01:39:41,543
You get diseases like spondylitis, like arthritis, like angina,

1148
01:39:41,743 --> 01:39:46,823
all kinds of funny diseases due to lethargic behavior come here

1149
01:39:46,983 --> 01:39:49,943
So please,

1150
01:39:50,103 --> 01:39:52,143
say it from your heart,

1151
01:39:52,343 --> 01:39:56,983
believing in yourself, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

1152
01:39:57,623 --> 01:40:00,583
As I have told you before, believe Me,

1153
01:40:00,783 --> 01:40:03,863
God is the ocean of love.

1154
01:40:04,143 --> 01:40:07,023
He is the ocean of compassion.

1155
01:40:07,223 --> 01:40:11,303
But above all, He is the ocean of forgiveness,

1156
01:40:11,463 --> 01:40:14,143
He’s the ocean of forgiveness.

1157
01:40:14,343 --> 01:40:16,943
So please don’t condemn yourself at all,

1158
01:40:17,103 --> 01:40:18,983
saying that "I am guilty" and this and that.

1159
01:40:19,183 --> 01:40:21,823
This is the biggest hurdle one has to cross through.

1160
01:40:21,982 --> 01:40:24,783
Please believe Me, you are not guilty at all!

1161
01:40:24,982 --> 01:40:26,223
You are the temple of God

1162
01:40:26,423 --> 01:40:28,743
and you have to become the light, that’s all.

1163
01:40:28,943 --> 01:40:30,743
The light has to be put in that temple.

1164
01:40:30,943 --> 01:40:34,103
So please do not condemn yourself. Forgive yourself!

1165
01:40:35,943 --> 01:40:39,463
Say it please sixteen times. There are sixteen petals.

1166
01:40:39,743 --> 01:40:41,943
But if you still think you are very guilty,

1167
01:40:42,143 --> 01:40:43,823
then you have a punishment of saying it

1168
01:40:43,983 --> 01:40:46,543
for108 times, is better,

1169
01:40:46,743 --> 01:40:49,623
so that at least you get rid of the guilt,

1170
01:40:50,223 --> 01:40:53,063
which is absolutely false and wrong.

1171
01:40:53,263 --> 01:40:56,903
It doesn’t exist, it's mythical.

1172
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:02,583
Now better? Much better. Much better?

1173
01:41:02,783 --> 01:41:05,383
SY: Cool, right too. The right is cool.

1174
01:41:05,623 --> 01:41:09,063
Right side. But for that we don’t need light anymore.

1175
01:41:09,463 --> 01:41:13,543
No more light then. We'll do with the water.

1176
01:41:22,863 --> 01:41:25,463
Now, all right, they are clear.

1177
01:41:27,023 --> 01:41:32,943
Now put the right hand on top of your forehead, across forehead,

1178
01:41:33,103 --> 01:41:36,783
pushing it on both sides as we do it when we have headaches.

1179
01:41:36,982 --> 01:41:38,823
Just put your hand there.

1180
01:41:38,982 --> 01:41:41,383
Now at this point,

1181
01:41:41,623 --> 01:41:46,982
we have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

1182
01:41:47,423 --> 01:41:51,183
Now the explanation could be, some may say “It’s very difficult”.

1183
01:41:51,383 --> 01:41:55,423
Many say like that “I’ll try”. But it is mythical.

1184
01:41:55,663 --> 01:41:59,063
Whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, is all mythical.

1185
01:41:59,303 --> 01:42:02,823
You don’t do anything about it, but when you don’t forgive,

1186
01:42:02,982 --> 01:42:07,023
then you play into the hands of those who want to harm you.

1187
01:42:07,223 --> 01:42:10,263
So don’t become weak like that. Just say, “I forgive”

1188
01:42:10,463 --> 01:42:13,743
and you’ll feel the tension will go away. Say it from your heart!

1189
01:42:13,943 --> 01:42:17,183
How many times is not the point. Say it from your heart.

1190
01:42:17,383 --> 01:42:20,103
Just from your heart, “I forgive everyone”.

1191
01:42:20,303 --> 01:42:24,863
The best way is to forgive everyone to get rid of all the problems.

1192
01:42:25,343 --> 01:42:28,743
That’s the greatest weapon Christ has given us. We should use it.

1193
01:42:28,943 --> 01:42:32,063
“Mother, I forgive everyone”.

1194
01:42:37,423 --> 01:42:40,743
Now take this hand on the back side of your head

1195
01:42:40,943 --> 01:42:43,223
and hold your optic globe, the back side.

1196
01:42:43,423 --> 01:42:47,983
Hold it tide, it's very good for the eyesight, this center.

1197
01:42:48,223 --> 01:42:50,063
Now the other side of it is,

1198
01:42:50,263 --> 01:42:52,982
that the way you feel guilty, the way you cannot forgive

1199
01:42:53,143 --> 01:42:56,663
is better that you ask God to forgive you, once for all.

1200
01:42:56,863 --> 01:43:01,143
You say, “Oh, Lord, oh, Divine”

1201
01:43:01,343 --> 01:43:03,783
- anything you want to address Him like -

1202
01:43:03,982 --> 01:43:06,463
“if I have done anything wrong

1203
01:43:06,703 --> 01:43:10,423
in the glory of Your name, please forgive me!”

1204
01:43:28,943 --> 01:43:32,263
Now take this hand on top of your head, on the fontanel bone area.

1205
01:43:32,463 --> 01:43:35,943
Now you are going to give yourself the baptism.

1206
01:43:36,103 --> 01:43:39,703
I’m not touching you there. Just put your palm,

1207
01:43:39,903 --> 01:43:43,383
pressed on this center,

1208
01:43:43,623 --> 01:43:45,863
where you had the soft bone in your childhood,

1209
01:43:46,023 --> 01:43:47,583
called the fontanel bone area.

1210
01:43:47,783 --> 01:43:50,423
Now press it hard, seven times move it.

1211
01:43:50,703 --> 01:43:53,903
At this point again I cannot force you.

1212
01:43:54,063 --> 01:43:57,103
You have to ask for your Self Realization.

1213
01:43:57,303 --> 01:44:00,743
So you have to say, “Mother, I want my Self Realization,

1214
01:44:00,943 --> 01:44:03,143
please give me Self Realization”, seven times

1215
01:44:03,343 --> 01:44:06,463
because as I told you there are seven chakras, all in the brain.

1216
01:44:06,703 --> 01:44:08,543
So please say it.

1217
01:44:59,982 --> 01:45:03,583
Now please take down your hand on your lap, carefully.

1218
01:45:03,783 --> 01:45:06,463
Open your eyes very slowly and don’t think about it.

1219
01:45:06,703 --> 01:45:07,783
You can do it now.

1220
01:45:07,982 --> 01:45:10,743
You have reached that state where you do not think.

1221
01:45:10,943 --> 01:45:14,183
Now, take your left hand and see for yourself

1222
01:45:14,383 --> 01:45:17,423
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head,

1223
01:45:17,663 --> 01:45:20,863
on top, here, on the fontanel bone area

1224
01:45:21,023 --> 01:45:23,303
about four inches, six inches above like that.

1225
01:45:23,543 --> 01:45:25,943
Move it up and down. You’ll find a cool breeze.

1226
01:45:26,103 --> 01:45:29,663
In front, in front. Little in front, not so much at the back.

1227
01:45:29,863 --> 01:45:33,863
Here, it is here. It is here, here you feel.

1228
01:45:36,063 --> 01:45:40,023
You can bend down your head if you like, and see for yourself.

1229
01:45:42,463 --> 01:45:44,463
Pay attention here.

1230
01:45:45,263 --> 01:45:46,663
Now with other hand.

1231
01:45:46,863 --> 01:45:50,703
Put the left hand towards Me, please, and see with the right hand.

1232
01:45:53,223 --> 01:45:55,223
It’s very subtle, it’s very subtle.

1233
01:45:55,423 --> 01:45:57,903
Those who came yesterday, will definitely feel it.

1234
01:45:58,063 --> 01:46:00,703
Even today they can, with little understanding.

1235
01:46:00,903 --> 01:46:02,423
Again the other hand, please!

1236
01:46:02,663 --> 01:46:05,983
The left hand on top and right hand towards Me, please!

1237
01:46:07,623 --> 01:46:11,983
Is there? [Almost] there? Again see.

1238
01:46:12,183 --> 01:46:15,143
See it’s coming out of your head, this is the real miracle,

1239
01:46:15,343 --> 01:46:19,103
that you cannot do it otherwise. This is what one should expect.

1240
01:46:19,383 --> 01:46:21,423
If they tell you to jump, scream,

1241
01:46:21,663 --> 01:46:24,063
that’s anybody can do; change your clothes, anybody can do it.

1242
01:46:24,263 --> 01:46:26,063
But see the cool breeze coming out of your head.

1243
01:46:26,263 --> 01:46:29,463
Now, again, the other hand. Once more.

1244
01:46:33,943 --> 01:46:36,943
Now, to feel it in the hands, the all-pervading Power

1245
01:46:37,103 --> 01:46:40,982
best way is to put up your hands like this, in the sky, loosely,

1246
01:46:41,143 --> 01:46:44,703
and put back your head, and spread out the hands and ask,

1247
01:46:44,943 --> 01:46:47,783
“Is this the All-pervading
Power of God’s love?

1248
01:46:47,982 --> 01:46:50,543
Is this the Brahma Shakti?”

1249
01:46:53,143 --> 01:46:57,303
Three times ask, “Is this the power of the Holy Ghost?"

1250
01:46:57,623 --> 01:47:00,103
"Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

1251
01:47:03,783 --> 01:47:07,543
Now bring it down. Now feel it in your hands.

1252
01:47:08,663 --> 01:47:13,663
Feeling very relaxed? Very relaxed. Feel it in your hands.

1253
01:47:14,183 --> 01:47:18,063
See now, if you are feeling the cool breeze in your hand.

1254
01:47:25,383 --> 01:47:26,903
All right?

1255
01:47:27,063 --> 01:47:29,263
It's good.

1256
01:47:30,423 --> 01:47:33,343
Now the last thing I want to tell you

1257
01:47:33,583 --> 01:47:35,663
how to protect your auras, very important.

1258
01:47:35,863 --> 01:47:37,583
And how to raise your Kundalini.

1259
01:47:37,783 --> 01:47:39,263
This will take about 5 minutes,

1260
01:47:39,463 --> 01:47:42,903
but you should do it before going to sleep. It’s very simple.

1261
01:47:43,103 --> 01:47:45,023
But you must do it to protect yourself.

1262
01:47:45,223 --> 01:47:47,863
It's very important to protect your auras.

1263
01:47:48,063 --> 01:47:52,263
You know, when the disciples of Christ

1264
01:47:52,463 --> 01:47:54,823
got their Realization through the Holy Ghost,

1265
01:47:54,983 --> 01:47:56,863
they started using their hands

1266
01:47:57,023 --> 01:47:59,383
in such a way that people thought they were mad

1267
01:47:59,623 --> 01:48:02,903
and were using the language, that people did not understand.

1268
01:48:03,063 --> 01:48:05,063
That was the language of the chakras

1269
01:48:05,263 --> 01:48:08,143
and the hands were used to use the power.

1270
01:48:08,343 --> 01:48:11,143
Now the left hand is towards Me. This is the end of it.

1271
01:48:11,343 --> 01:48:14,183
Now put the right hand as...

1272
01:48:14,383 --> 01:48:16,823
You just don’t face that, because they cannot see.

1273
01:48:16,983 --> 01:48:19,023
So face that side, it's all right.

1274
01:48:19,223 --> 01:48:22,223
Now this one is to be taken like that, on top of your head.

1275
01:48:22,423 --> 01:48:24,063
So we’ll start it.

1276
01:48:24,263 --> 01:48:27,982
One, to seven chakras we have to do seven times.

1277
01:48:28,183 --> 01:48:30,823
Yes, two. It's very simple.

1278
01:48:31,223 --> 01:48:34,023
This is you are giving. Three.

1279
01:48:34,223 --> 01:48:37,063
Is four.

1280
01:48:37,263 --> 01:48:41,063
Is five.

1281
01:48:41,263 --> 01:48:44,623
Six. And seven.

1282
01:48:44,823 --> 01:48:46,263
Now to increase your vibrations,

1283
01:48:46,463 --> 01:48:48,703
you must know how to raise your Kundalini.

1284
01:48:48,903 --> 01:48:52,303
To increase your vibrations is best to know, everyone should know,

1285
01:48:52,463 --> 01:48:53,743
how to raise the Kundalini,

1286
01:48:53,943 --> 01:48:56,063
which is a very simple thing to do again.

1287
01:48:56,263 --> 01:49:00,023
With the left hand towards the Kundalini to be kept

1288
01:49:00,223 --> 01:49:01,743
and to be watched all the time

1289
01:49:01,943 --> 01:49:06,463
and the right hand is to be taken up, front, low, back

1290
01:49:06,703 --> 01:49:10,223
like that a clockwise. So we have to move it upper on our head.

1291
01:49:10,423 --> 01:49:11,943
Let’s do it!

1292
01:49:12,103 --> 01:49:16,023
Move it upward. Push back your head, push back your hands

1293
01:49:16,223 --> 01:49:20,303
and give it a twist. Give it a twist and now give it a knot..

1294
01:49:20,543 --> 01:49:24,423
Once more. Again, do it thrice.

1295
01:49:25,223 --> 01:49:29,783
Again we do it once more. Now it goes faster.

1296
01:49:29,982 --> 01:49:32,703
Now give it a twist

1297
01:49:32,903 --> 01:49:34,743
and give it a knot!

1298
01:49:34,943 --> 01:49:37,583
In the third state we have to give three knots.

1299
01:49:37,783 --> 01:49:41,423
Let’s do it once more! That’s all.

1300
01:49:42,023 --> 01:49:45,743
Now see how it moves faster. Now push back your head!

1301
01:49:45,943 --> 01:49:49,423
Give it one twist, give it another twist,

1302
01:49:49,663 --> 01:49:50,982
and give it the third one.

1303
01:49:51,143 --> 01:49:52,943
That’s how you tie your Kundalini up there.

1304
01:49:53,103 --> 01:49:55,983
Now feel the cool breeze in your hands. Better?

1305
01:50:00,943 --> 01:50:05,063
All right? It's better now?

1306
01:50:09,583 --> 01:50:12,783
Some of you have not felt, doesn’t matter.

1307
01:50:12,983 --> 01:50:15,223
Most of you have felt it. Let’s see how many have felt

1308
01:50:15,423 --> 01:50:17,383
either in the head or in the hands or both.

1309
01:50:17,623 --> 01:50:20,943
Just lift your hands like this, I would like to see.

1310
01:50:22,623 --> 01:50:26,783
[Look at that], Australians, I bow to you all.

1311
01:50:40,263 --> 01:50:42,743
So don’t discuss about it, don’t talk about it.

1312
01:50:42,943 --> 01:50:45,383
Give yourself a bandhan, as we said the protection,

1313
01:50:45,663 --> 01:50:47,743
and the raising of the Kundalini before sleeping.

1314
01:50:47,943 --> 01:50:50,623
Put your attention here and I hope you’ll come Wednesday,

1315
01:50:50,823 --> 01:50:54,103
for the workshop, where we’ll tell you more about it,

1316
01:50:54,303 --> 01:50:56,903
and you will learn it very fast.

1317
01:50:57,263 --> 01:51:01,143
