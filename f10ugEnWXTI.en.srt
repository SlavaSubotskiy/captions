1
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:13,838
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

2
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:27,968
I am very happy that this book is now published
and a subtler side, a deeper dimension of

3
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:36,076
‘Gita’ is being brought, to the readers.

4
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:55,998
As Krishna was a great diplomat and understood
that human beings are very clever and they

5
00:00:55,998 --> 00:01:00,218
cannot accept truth in a straightforward manner.

6
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:13,578
He, in His advice to Arjuna used His diplomacy
and the essence of His diplomacy is always

7
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:25,927
specially of the defined, Divine Diplomacy
which He used that give absurd conditions

8
00:01:25,927 --> 00:01:35,468
and solutions to such difficult people who
are so proud of their limited intellect.

9
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:41,790
That’s a difference between a father and
a mother I should say.

10
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:43,979
As we say in Hindi ‘Sidhe Haath ghee na
nikle tho tedhii ungli karni pardti hai’

11
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:48,951
[Meaning: when we can’t take out ghee with
straight finger, we have to bend our finger.

12
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:53,125
Famous proverb implying that when we can’t
get a work done in a straight way, we need

13
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,701
to bend our ways.].

14
00:01:54,908 --> 00:02:06,227
The first and foremost thing we have to understand
that Shri Krishna is a Divine incarnation

15
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:19,968
and He came at a time where we needed to understand
what is the essence of dharma.

16
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:29,325
For example I have been quite surprised the
way people explain Him

17
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,790
as far as the hinsa is concerned.

18
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:40,878
That Shri Krishna preached ahinsa to such
an extent that we have to look after all the

19
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,379
mosquitoes of Delhi.

20
00:02:43,451 --> 00:03:02,278
Such absurd things people have deducted by
what Krishna tried to emphasize in Shri Gita.

21
00:03:02,278 --> 00:03:16,898
When the war started, Arjuna actually became
nervous I can say and He said, “I would

22
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:23,613
not like to fight My own kith and kin and
My Gurus.”

23
00:03:24,018 --> 00:03:32,188
So Shri Krishna says, “They are already
dead, they are killed.

24
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:34,862
Because they were not enlightened people,

25
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:38,772
are already dead people their eyes are not open.

26
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:42,979
Whom are You going to kill here?

27
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:49,428
Just You have to remove some people from this
Earth to establish Dharma."

28
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:56,469
Now the idea of Dharma according to us is
some sort of a Hinduism or Islamism or some

29
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,973
sort of a ism; it is not.

30
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:08,128
Dharma is the valency in a human being just
like carbon has four valencies; dharma has

31
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:10,558
ten valencies in a human being.

32
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:17,238
And when a person falls down from there then
he loses his powers as a human being.

33
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:26,358
One of the examples He said at the time of
war – Karna the great generous man very

34
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:39,198
well known for His great virtues was caught
up by a wheel of His chariot and He could

35
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:43,238
not take out His leg out of that chariot.

36
00:04:43,238 --> 00:05:01,308
When Arjuna faced Him and raised His own Gandiva
and Karna challenged Him saying that, “I

37
00:05:01,308 --> 00:05:15,747
am a Vira” – a chivalrous person, a person
who is fighting, “and You are another warrior

38
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:26,465
and in Dharma when I have no weapons on Me,
You cannot kill Me with Your  .”

39
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:33,708
That time Shri Krishna pointed at Him like
this and He said, “Kill Him.

40
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:42,574
Where was His warrior virtues when Draupadi
was insulted?

41
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:48,856
Draupadi’s insult was the greatest sin that
was committed and

42
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,190
what was He doing at that time?”

43
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:57,736
And Arjuna killed Karna.

44
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:03,375
This is Dharma.

45
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:17,451
He’s called as the Leeladhara – the one
for Him the whole world is a play.

46
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:23,188
And that’s why He says that already they
are killed.

47
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:27,907
That doesn’t mean that you start killing
people, becoming violent

48
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:30,432
 because you do not agree with some people.

49
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:36,926
Shri Krishna can say whom to kill.

50
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:47,027
You have to be a realized soul to understand
why Shri Krishna had to ask Him to kill and

51
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:52,926
why the Goddess had to kill so many demons.

52
00:06:55,147 --> 00:07:04,713
But the idea today is – we should try to
be sympathetic towards also demons and the

53
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:11,907
devils who are spreading ‘asuri vidya’
everywhere.

54
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:20,403
And we should be sympathetic with all the
people and there is good in everyone.

55
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:23,087
That is not Krishna’s message.

56
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:30,423
He showed His love by killing the demons.

57
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:41,740
I don’t know in this book if I have talked
on this point or not because he had very limited

58
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:45,465
subjects, which he dealt with, and I didn’t
want to pressurize him

59
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,144
 with some new subject matters.

60
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:54,168
But there’s one thing definitely, which
I didn’t say there which is a very important

61
00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:57,497
point one should try to see.

62
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:13,247
That the awareness – ‘Chetana’, the
awareness, grows downward of a human being

63
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:20,762
and the roots of the tree of the awareness
are in the brain.

64
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:30,630
So one has to take to ‘urdvagati’ – means
the ascent and not to the descent.

65
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:41,128
A human being is born in the Bhavasagara,
which is as we call in the void, as you can

66
00:08:41,128 --> 00:08:44,678
see here clearly in Sahaja Yoga.

67
00:08:44,678 --> 00:08:49,798
Either he can go upward or he can go downward.

68
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:59,588
Now see the, how the human awareness has reached
‘adhogati’ – is a downward descent.

69
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:07,948
Very simple to see if you understand what
Krishna meant that the roots are in the brain?

70
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:15,498
When I’ve been in the Western countries
I realize it’s much more because they are

71
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:22,014
supposed to be advanced, developed, sophisticated,
educated,

72
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,629
intellectuals, whatever you may call them.

73
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:32,655
I’ve been to all Communists countries and
all the democracies and all kinds of isms.

74
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:41,698
What I realized that exactly what Shri Krishna
had said that asuri vidya will take over.

75
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:47,021
The descent of awareness is seen clearly in
those countries.

76
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:50,193
Thank God we are not that advanced.

77
00:09:54,336 --> 00:10:00,829
The descent starts from the Nabhi Chakra as
we call it where a person starts seeking the

78
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:08,650
food this that and other requirements, then
it starts moving downwards.

79
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:13,990
The essence of the Nabhi Chakra is ‘Swaha’.

80
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:17,458
‘Swaha’ is the consumption.

81
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:22,448
It consumes everything, it aggresses everything,
consumes, just like the fire.

82
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:27,778
In the same way once upon a time these developed
countries spread all over the world started

83
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:31,324
consuming everyone.

84
00:10:33,188 --> 00:10:40,319
Ruling our country, China, all kinds of countries,
they went round all over the world.

85
00:10:40,628 --> 00:10:46,012
Thank God Columbus missed his point otherwise
we would not have been here.

86
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:53,253
He went to America and you cannot find aboriginals
unless and until you enter into

87
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,872
some far fetched places like Peru.

88
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:05,116
Then the consumption of money on the economic
ground started.

89
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:12,888
Then the consumption of the Mother Earth started
at the ‘Bhu’ level.

90
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:18,758
But the ‘Bhurva’ is the ‘Antariksha’
in the whole Universe.

91
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:22,901
We are going to the Sun, we are going to the
moon, we are going to this,

92
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:24,328
we are going to that.

93
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:28,058
What about going inside in the ascent?

94
00:11:31,728 --> 00:11:40,015
Now little bit they are seeing it that there’s
intelligence also plus the energy.

95
00:11:40,729 --> 00:11:45,087
But you are seeing it from the outside.

96
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:50,852
That’s the intelligence of God Almighty,
whether you like it or not.

97
00:11:52,098 --> 00:11:56,882
So now we are going to the ‘Antarikshas’,
we are going to all these Universes

98
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:58,993
to find what?

99
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:08,738
So the ‘Bhurva’ is the essence – the
‘Antariksha’.

100
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:11,688
Awareness reached there also.

101
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:17,918
Then it has gone further.

102
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:25,608
In the Sahaja Yoga we can say that from Nabhi
chakra they started moving downwards towards

103
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:32,438
the Swadishthana, which deals with the Antariksha,
with the Universes, which was created by the

104
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:34,748
Creator Brahmadeva.

105
00:12:34,748 --> 00:12:45,619
Below that they moved again, comes the Mooladhara,
which is the essence of human life, which

106
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:48,428
is the support of human life.

107
00:12:48,428 --> 00:12:54,558
For which Christ Himself has said, “Thou
shall not have adulterous eyes.

108
00:12:54,558 --> 00:13:02,238
” I have yet to find real Christians of
that kind who do not have adulterous eyes.

109
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:09,509
And that’s why people have gone to now nothing
but they have become sex points,

110
00:13:09,534 --> 00:13:11,589
I can tell you.

111
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:21,086
The whole awareness of your intellectual movement
has gone to nothing but to this filth

112
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:23,308
beyond Ganesha.

113
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:29,928
You have left everything that was holy, that
was auspicious, much behind and crossed, and

114
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:35,935
one step forward and the hell is there, the
hell.

115
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:42,913
Where our awareness is going today?

116
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:49,368
But we have not thought of the ‘urdvagati’
that Shri Krishna has said.

117
00:13:49,368 --> 00:13:56,488
Giving lectures on Shri Krishna, having bhajans
about Shri Krishna, makes no difference.

118
00:13:56,488 --> 00:14:00,188
What about the urdvagati?

119
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:04,820
In the sixth century a great saint Gyaneshwara
was born.

120
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:10,238
In the sixth chapter of Gyaneshwari He’s
clearly described, is the Kundalini, which

121
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:15,498
is going to raise you higher, very clearly,
openly He said it.

122
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:18,808
Of course as usual everybody tortured His
life.

123
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:25,929
He didn’t have sometimes water to drink,
that’s different.

124
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:34,118
In the sixth chapter when He described, even
today in Maharashtra it is said that

125
00:14:34,118 --> 00:14:36,306
sixth chapter is tabooed.

126
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:40,136
You are not supposed to read the sixth chapter
of Gyaneshwari.

127
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:45,866
Why?

128
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:51,801
Because they don’t know a word about Kundalini
and they don’t know how to ascend?

129
00:14:52,197 --> 00:14:57,228
Because it is the knowledge of the roots you
have to go to.

130
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:08,088
If you are honest please try to understand
that what Shri Krishna has said that the roots

131
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:18,868
are in the brain and the awareness grows towards
‘adhogati’.

132
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:25,268
He did not say precisely that Kundalini is
the one that gives you the urdvagati.

133
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:27,903
He did not say; that was not the time.

134
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:34,118
At the time of war when He was talking about
Dharma, He did not mention the word Kundalini

135
00:15:34,118 --> 00:15:38,378
doesn’t mean that there was no device behind
it.

136
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:46,390
Marx   said that we would like to have a country
without State.

137
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:47,287
How?

138
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:49,274
How will you have?

139
00:15:49,502 --> 00:15:55,908
I’ve been to most of the Communist countries
I think the state is very powerful.

140
00:15:55,908 --> 00:16:02,208
The democrat said that we would like to have
a free nation.

141
00:16:03,152 --> 00:16:04,430
Free?

142
00:16:04,525 --> 00:16:05,819
Abandonment.

143
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,488
It is demonacracy they are practicing.

144
00:16:09,488 --> 00:16:14,454
If you want to deceive yourself and all the
time, accept something that is falsehood

145
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,448
 nobody can help you.

146
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:24,438
But the time is precarious and is important
that we should see to the truth that the name

147
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:32,089
of democracy and the name of communism and
the name of capitalism is just a myth.

148
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:36,738
It has not given what it had promised.

149
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:50,944
So let us come back to the Saints – to the
deeper people, to the people who understood

150
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:54,127
life beyond life.

151
00:16:55,309 --> 00:17:05,382
There we find the urdvagati, has to be, the
ascent has to be achieved.

152
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,348
How, is the point?

153
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:18,767
Then later on Mohammad Saab also has talked
about it, not that He has not talked; He’s

154
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:21,237
talked about the Resurrection.

155
00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:24,747
He said that at the time of Resurrection your
hands will speak.

156
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,636
Who’s bothered about that?

157
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:30,517
The whole Namaz is nothing but Kundalini raising.

158
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,632
But it leads to another kind of stupid fanaticism.

159
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,295
Christians are sophisticated fanatics.

160
00:17:40,422 --> 00:17:42,504
Hindus are another type of fanatics.

161
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:49,267
Everybody is become a fanatic because it’s
all a dead flower.

162
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:53,617
All these flowers grew on one tree of life.

163
00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:01,186
They’ve been extracted, taken over as mine,
mine, mine and they are all

164
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:02,978
fighting about it.

165
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:14,698
So it’s only the Kundalini awakening which
is going to give you your Self-Realization

166
00:18:14,698 --> 00:18:28,085
and this Self-Realization is going to let
you know that you are a part and parcel

167
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,804
of the whole.

168
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:33,222
It’s not just a mental conception.

169
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:35,767
This is the point we miss every time.

170
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:44,470
All these democracies and capitalism and all
these theories are mental projections

171
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:46,144
of human beings.

172
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:55,718
All these mental projections are nothing but
your own jails, your own bondages into which

173
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,527
you are caught up.

174
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,396
You have to get out of it.

175
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:09,808
Even to such an extent that people start saying
that Adishankaracharya did not write

176
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,027
Saundarya Lahiri.

177
00:19:11,052 --> 00:19:12,314
Who says that?

178
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:14,268
Intellectuals again.

179
00:19:16,117 --> 00:19:18,587
What makes them think that he did not write?

180
00:19:18,738 --> 00:19:21,078
They have explanations for everything.

181
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:27,971
But he did, which we can prove after Self-Realization.

182
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:35,808
How all the essence of all the religions are
so much one can be proved only after Self-Realization

183
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:39,307
and not through discussions.

184
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:49,658
Because Self – the Spirit, is the absolute
and is the collective being, that is not the

185
00:19:49,658 --> 00:19:51,348
awakened within us.

186
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:54,867
One may say that why Buddha did not talk of
God?

187
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:59,917
Because he knew human beings very well and
he said, “No use talking about God, better

188
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:02,238
talk about Self-Realization”.

189
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:04,568
Same with Mahavira.

190
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:07,064
But what are the Buddhists and Mahaviris doing?

191
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:08,230
God alone knows.

192
00:20:08,255 --> 00:20:10,416
Where are they?

193
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:23,338
But today is the time as described in the
Puranas many, many seekers are born on Earth.

194
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:29,047
A special time is a time of real blossom.

195
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:33,478
Maybe in the olden day there were only one
or two flowers like Nachiketa.

196
00:20:33,478 --> 00:20:41,188
But today is the time when thousands are there
just to become the fruit.

197
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:51,128
But unfortunately a market has been opened
out where the seekers go and get lost.

198
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:56,198
Get lost into the convictions and the ideas
of some other person which is gone into their

199
00:20:56,198 --> 00:20:58,328
heads and they just finish off there.

200
00:20:58,328 --> 00:21:04,957
Their seeking finishes off there, they end
up as sick or obstinate people.

201
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:09,157
They do not want to go any further.

202
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:18,833
Shri Krishna is to be understood in Sahaja
style.

203
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:22,848
Leela – He was Leeladhara.

204
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:31,878
In the Sahaja Yoga we believe that on the
left hand side, the left sympathetic nervous

205
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:39,988
system is represented by the ‘Ida Nadi’
– which we call as also the ‘Chandra Nadi’

206
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:49,232
and the right hand side it is represented
by the ‘Pingala Nadi’ – the right sympathetic.

207
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:55,828
The left we use when we desire.

208
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:59,958
The right we use when we act.

209
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:07,107
The left is the ‘bhakti marga’ [path of
devotion] and the right is the ‘karma marga’

210
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:12,958
[path of action] that they used for doing
all kinds of yagnas and all that.

211
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:24,138
The central part of ascent is the ‘Sushumna’
is the path of dharma.

212
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:32,590
‘Dharaiti Sa dharma’ – means the one
that is your sustenance is the Dharma.

213
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:40,598
It’s not an outside concept but an innate
nature of human beings is the dharma.

214
00:22:40,598 --> 00:22:45,718
This dharma we have achieved through evolutionary
process, as you know ‘matsya rupa’ and

215
00:22:45,718 --> 00:22:47,328
other things took place.

216
00:22:47,328 --> 00:22:50,518
And afterwards we are today human beings.

217
00:22:51,644 --> 00:22:53,479
But why?

218
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,657
Let us ask a question, simple question to
ourselves ‘why are we here on this Earth?

219
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,423
To seek what?

220
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:06,914
To seek the truth and what is the truth?’

221
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:12,134
The truth is that you are the Spirit.

222
00:23:12,907 --> 00:23:22,828
Not this bhakti, not this karma.

223
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:27,257
But you are the Spirit.

224
00:23:27,257 --> 00:23:34,088
Now Shri Krishna’s diplomacy can be seen
very clearly, if you want to see even, even

225
00:23:34,088 --> 00:23:35,998
without Self-Realization.

226
00:23:36,078 --> 00:23:41,328
He says for bhakti [devotion] – “patram”
[leaf], “pushpam” [flower], “phalam”

227
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:43,188
[fruit], “toyam” [water].

228
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:47,117
All these things you give it to Him, He’ll
accept.

229
00:23:47,117 --> 00:23:55,348
But see the diplomacy on one word He has played
the whole people and nobody has seen the point.

230
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:57,345
What does He say?

231
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:03,346
He says that you have to do ‘ananya bhakti’.

232
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:06,988
‘Ananya’ shabda [word] itself means, the
word itself means when there is not the other;

233
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:09,221
means you are a realized soul.

234
00:24:09,246 --> 00:24:14,208
Logically let us see what does it mean?

235
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:19,907
If there is no connection with God whom are
you praying to?

236
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:23,548
The connection has to be established.

237
00:24:23,581 --> 00:24:27,427
You may go on describing God as a myth, you
may go on

238
00:24:27,452 --> 00:24:29,558
supporting Him doing anything you like.

239
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:36,856
But you have not yet been connected with Him
what are you talking?

240
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:41,887
Something in the air.

241
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:45,147
‘Ananya bhakti’.

242
00:24:45,147 --> 00:24:47,988
Now about karma, see the diplomacy.

243
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:52,417
If you keep your mind open as a scientist
you’ll see My point clearly.

244
00:24:52,417 --> 00:25:04,572
For that He says that do your karmas but put
the fruit of your doing

245
00:25:04,597 --> 00:25:07,008
at the Lotus Feet   of the Lord.

246
00:25:07,318 --> 00:25:13,909
This is the absurd condition; is not possible,
cannot be done.

247
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:17,164
Before Realization you cannot do this.

248
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:21,858
Many people come to Me, “Yes Mother You
know whatever we are doing, we are putting

249
00:25:21,858 --> 00:25:27,367
at the Lotus Feet of the God” – black
marketing, everything.

250
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,792
What does that mean?

251
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:38,884
That you put it at the Lotus Feet of the Lord,
that you are no more there.

252
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:48,287
It’s only after Realization you realize,
that a Sahaja Yogi would tell you, he doesn’t

253
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:54,667
say, “I give him Realization”, he doesn’t
say that, “I am moving his Kundalini.”

254
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:59,657
” What he says, “It is not moving, It
is not coming up.

255
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:06,588
There was a lady who traveled with Me to America
once and her son came all the way from Honalulu,

256
00:26:06,588 --> 00:26:10,377
a very rich man and all those things.

257
00:26:10,377 --> 00:26:12,661
So he could not get his Realization.

258
00:26:12,963 --> 00:26:16,188
So she came to Me and said, “Mother, give
him the Realization.”

259
00:26:16,215 --> 00:26:17,398
I said, “You give him.”

260
00:26:17,423 --> 00:26:19,913
She said, “No, no, no I cannot give him.”

261
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:25,419
So I said, “I can’t give him either, the
Kundalini doesn’t move what to do?

262
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:28,953
Then give him a false certificate you are
a realized soul.

263
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:33,062
He can say ‘born again’ or sort of a nonsense
he can go about, talking about.”

264
00:26:35,065 --> 00:26:38,127
She said, “No, no how can you give such
a false certificate?”

265
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:39,127
I said, “That’s it.

266
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:46,558
If the Kundalini has not risen if it is not
broken the Brahmarandra we cannot even say

267
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,758
it is awakened, leave alone calling him a
Sahaja Yogi.”

268
00:26:50,886 --> 00:26:52,513
She agreed there.

269
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:56,088
You cannot give a false certificate about
it.

270
00:26:56,088 --> 00:27:01,007
That’s what happens when you do your karmas.

271
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:03,308
You don’t say that you are doing it.

272
00:27:03,308 --> 00:27:09,750
It’s done ‘it’ in the third; like small
children always talk like that.

273
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:14,450
“Mother this boy Munna wont listen, is a
bad one.”

274
00:27:14,562 --> 00:27:17,837
In the third person they talk so many
times you must’ve seen.

275
00:27:18,107 --> 00:27:24,622
In the same way a realized soul always talks
in the third person.

276
00:27:26,257 --> 00:27:31,867
That’s the different world in which they
have lived and they have been very, very few

277
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:41,114
tortured, and never understood by the people
who were ruling or the people who were the

278
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:45,178
intellectuals or whose who were the priests.

279
00:27:45,178 --> 00:27:50,969
And the public was helplessly watching all
their tortures.

280
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:56,848
In Maharashtra we have a great saint called
Namdev.

281
00:27:56,848 --> 00:28:07,127
Very great saint – Namdeva, he was a tailor,
ordinary tailor and when this tailor went

282
00:28:07,127 --> 00:28:16,772
to see another saint whose name was Gorakumbhar
– is a potter.

283
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:24,925
The words he says is so beautiful which you
can understand

284
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,552
with little subtler feelings about it.

285
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:37,667
He says, “Nirgunachya bheti aalo sagunashi”
– I came here to meet the nirguna – the

286
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:42,315
formless and here is standing in the form.

287
00:28:42,577 --> 00:28:46,318
Where do you find these talks these days?

288
00:28:46,318 --> 00:28:52,517
If two great meet they go with swords, with
pistols.

289
00:28:52,517 --> 00:29:04,297
Here he goes and talks to a potter that I
came to see the ‘nirakara’, the ‘nirguna’

290
00:29:04,297 --> 00:29:08,047
– the formless and here it is in the form.

291
00:29:08,352 --> 00:29:10,232
But he was a tailor.

292
00:29:10,257 --> 00:29:14,575
How can be a tailor a realized soul?

293
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:27,228
And when Namdeva went to Punjab Shri Nanak
Saab gave Him all the honor of a saint and

294
00:29:27,228 --> 00:29:34,078
told Him that He should also write some beautiful
verses because He compiled the Granth Saab

295
00:29:34,078 --> 00:29:43,925
out of all the realized souls poems – that
You compile the poems in Punjabi or Hindi.

296
00:29:44,044 --> 00:29:50,048
Namadeva, coming from such a far-fetched place
He studied Hindi and Punjabi and you’ll

297
00:29:50,048 --> 00:29:58,480
be amazed that half of His book, which is
so big is in Hindi or in Punjabi language.

298
00:29:58,512 --> 00:30:02,478
For that you need Shri Nanaka who can recognize.

299
00:30:02,478 --> 00:30:09,848
But today seekers run after somebody who pampers
their ego, where you can pay some money, where

300
00:30:09,848 --> 00:30:18,048
you can befool you by getting some Rolls Royces
or some sort of a Geeta pravachana [discourse]

301
00:30:18,073 --> 00:30:22,980
he gives or gives you some sort of a name
in the ear so that you become mad.

302
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:29,928
This is the quality of the seekers, which
I have to face.

303
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:37,356
Whatever it is, the concern is so great; whatever
is the quality today it has to happen, it

304
00:30:37,381 --> 00:30:38,907
has to work out.

305
00:30:38,907 --> 00:30:48,545
Which one now I heard to My complete surprise
that now people – the intellectuals are

306
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:56,568
propounding, that the Namadeva who came from
Maharashtra was not the same as the Namadeva

307
00:30:56,568 --> 00:31:03,027
who was a tailor because he was not an intellectual.

308
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:12,117
I am talking about the unlimited not about
the limited.

309
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:19,407
Like in any one of your spacecrafts you have
different cylinders, which explode one after

310
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:25,472
another and accelerate the one, which comes.

311
00:31:25,941 --> 00:31:31,887
First one will explode and accelerate the
second one; the second one will explode and

312
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:33,907
accelerate the third one.

313
00:31:33,907 --> 00:31:46,948
In the same way the intellect is to be exploded
to go into the space, to jump into the space,

314
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:54,987
is the most important thing that the intellect
has to leave its limitedness to the unlimited

315
00:31:54,987 --> 00:31:58,527
intelligence, which covers the whole universe.

316
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:03,861
That is the ‘Brahma Shakti’ described,
that’s the All-Pervading Power of God, that

317
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:06,276
is the power of love of God.

318
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:16,138
And is such a tremendous one where Shri Krishna
Himself has said ‘Yogakshema Vahamyaham’.

319
00:32:16,138 --> 00:32:17,138
First He said ‘yoga’.

320
00:32:17,138 --> 00:32:19,587
Why did He not say ‘Kshema Yoga’?

321
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:26,636
Many people ask Me in the West that how is
it in Your country there’s so much of poverty

322
00:32:26,937 --> 00:32:30,237
and that You talk that it’s a Yoga bhumi?

323
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:35,036
Because we have not taken to yoga so far.

324
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:44,745
And Kshema doesn’t mean how may pubs you
have in your village, it doesn’t mean how

325
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:49,344
many drunkards move about in your village,
it means,

326
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:52,415
 how many saints there are in your country.

327
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:59,582
Let the Yoga come up, you’ll be surprised
this great country of Bharat Bhoomi will one

328
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:02,667
day show its merit to the whole world.

329
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:13,407
In its reality, in its glory and in its Divinity
which resides in this country.

330
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:19,167
You are great people that you are born in
this country but you don’t know, you have

331
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:22,448
no idea as to where you are born?

332
00:33:22,448 --> 00:33:24,669
What is your heritage?

333
00:33:24,788 --> 00:33:30,556
There are people I’ve met very surprisingly
so

334
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:46,897
stupefied by Hegle and Kant and all such people
that they believe that all these saints and

335
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:56,627
all these great people including Krishna or
Rama, all of them are false.

336
00:33:56,627 --> 00:34:03,008
This is the height of arrogance and ignorance
both put together because they are ignorant

337
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:07,018
one has to forgive them, there’s no way
out.

338
00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:20,248
God is the ocean of love, ocean of praise,
ocean of wisdom, ocean of this All-Pervading

339
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:37,777
Power, which is so efficient, so kind, so
understanding, works out everything so well.

340
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:43,628
But above all He is the ocean of forgiveness
I can tell you.

341
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:51,128
I really tell you in My experience, I feel
this forgiveness is so greatly effective today

342
00:34:51,153 --> 00:34:55,740
otherwise I don’t think I could’ve managed
this job so well.

343
00:34:55,765 --> 00:34:57,618
May God bless you all.

344
00:34:57,618 --> 00:35:09,258
As a Mother I’ve try to explain and express
My concern.

345
00:35:09,258 --> 00:35:10,679
Try to understand.

346
00:35:10,704 --> 00:35:17,566
It is Sahaja – is born with you, ‘Sahaja’
– ‘saha’ means with, ‘ja’ – born.

347
00:35:17,591 --> 00:35:21,738
It’s your fundamental right as a human being
to get your Self-Realization.

348
00:35:21,738 --> 00:35:26,248
But if you want to deny it because you have
some convictions because you are following

349
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:31,888
certain people, because you think this is
all right we don’t want to have Self-Realization.

350
00:35:31,888 --> 00:35:35,577
God is not going to fall at your feet.

351
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:39,658
You have to ask for it.

352
00:35:39,658 --> 00:35:43,522
You have to knock at the door and the door
will be opened.

353
00:35:43,776 --> 00:35:51,978
In Sahaja Yoga we can prove today that there’s
no quarrel between Moses and Christ, there

354
00:35:51,978 --> 00:36:00,625
is no quarrel between Christ and Mohammad
Saab and there is no quarrel between Mohammad

355
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,849
Saab and Shri Krishna.

356
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:05,282
They are all one together.

357
00:36:05,536 --> 00:36:10,507
As Christ has clearly said, “Those who are
not against Me are with Me.

358
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:12,448
” Who wants to see that?

359
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:15,928
Who are those?

360
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:23,438
Christ was not even allowed to work out for
more than three and half years.

361
00:36:23,438 --> 00:36:29,128
It took Me four years to give Realization
to seven English men.

362
00:36:29,128 --> 00:36:31,765
So you can imagine what must be His plight?

363
00:36:31,877 --> 00:36:36,638
Three and a half years with all the mad people
around.

364
00:36:36,638 --> 00:36:38,678
But not in our villages.

365
00:36:38,678 --> 00:36:45,688
Yesterday I went to Jaipur; first we had a
big meeting in a big sophisticated hall and

366
00:36:45,688 --> 00:36:49,178
all this and this, My Indian English.

367
00:36:49,178 --> 00:36:55,557
I was trying to explain to them and I thought
it’s all gone over their heads; nothing

368
00:36:55,582 --> 00:36:59,498
went inside or maybe under their feet.

369
00:36:59,982 --> 00:37:05,898
Then I said, “Let’s go to a place where
ordinary people live.

370
00:37:05,898 --> 00:37:12,329
And there I found thousands thronging together
to get their Self-Realization.

371
00:37:12,354 --> 00:37:17,438
They don’t want money, they don’t want
power, they don’t want anything, they don’t

372
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:20,557
want any conviction, they want their Self-Realization.

373
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:23,068
“Maa humko atma bodh dijiye.

374
00:37:23,093 --> 00:37:24,780
Humko atma gyan.

375
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:32,068
” They understand that ‘bodha’ doesn’t
mean lecturing, it doesn’t mean, it means

376
00:37:32,068 --> 00:37:37,671
on your central nervous system you have to
feel the All-Pervading Power – that is ‘bodha’,

377
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:40,651
that is the “vidh” which is described
in the Vedas.

378
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:46,350
They understand; they live with the life,
they are natural people.

379
00:37:46,453 --> 00:37:49,342
They know all this talking is on and on and
on.

380
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:55,132
They know something has to happen and the
second thing they said was so encouraging

381
00:37:55,157 --> 00:37:59,913
– “Ke Maa parivartan hona chahiye ham
mein” – we should be transformed.

382
00:37:59,938 --> 00:38:03,974
It’s not our mental idea that we have become
some great yogi, this, that.

383
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:05,609
We should be transformed.

384
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:11,542
I said, “Not only transformed but you’ll
have your powers as realized souls”.

385
00:38:11,947 --> 00:38:19,996
By God’s grace even in Delhi, which is supposed
to be the most sophisticated place where after

386
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:23,630
English left we became merry more, much more
westernized;

387
00:38:23,655 --> 00:38:26,880
when they were here we were better off.

388
00:38:27,229 --> 00:38:40,057
And in this place also I find there are so
many great Sahaja Yogis who are now completely

389
00:38:40,082 --> 00:38:48,674
endowed with the power of Realization, of
curing, of doing all the things that can be

390
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:52,741
done as a yogi.

391
00:38:53,297 --> 00:39:00,606
I hope today all of you will get your Realization,
but you have to establish yourself.

392
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:09,793
It’s just a wee bit of your Kundalini, I
should say like a hair comes out through the

393
00:39:09,818 --> 00:39:21,447
Brahma Nadi, but with humility, abhyase [practice],
for few days you establish yourself.

394
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:25,729
Of course today you might get your ‘nirvichar
samadhi’ [thoughtless awareness] just like

395
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,990
that, maybe.

396
00:39:27,015 --> 00:39:31,765
But you’ll have to establish your ‘nirvikalpa’
[doubtless awareness].

397
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:36,696
You must give some time to yourself and some
respect to your Self-Realization and to yourself

398
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:37,971
[pratigya?

399
00:39:38,073 --> 00:39:40,777
May God bless you.
