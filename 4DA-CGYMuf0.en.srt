00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,170
October 9, 1987
Mahalakshmi Puja, Belgium

2
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:31,661
It was so very nice to come to Belgium and
have so many people for our program and I

3
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:44,451
must say, now we are getting to people who
are very sensitive. [translation follows - yes]

4
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:07,131
It is a .. it is a new dimension I think,
I feel, we are entering into. Because now

5
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:23,111
we are really getting people who are seriously
interested in their realization and are very

6
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:37,371
respectful. And that aggressiveness is much
less. You don’t find anybody being aggressive.

7
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:50,441
So we can say, that now the road is paved
for all of you to work it out in a Sahaj manner

8
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:05,630
to bring them properly to Sahaja Yoga and
settle them nicely. Now this Sahaj manner

9
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:19,630
should be understood. In a Sahaj manner, when
they come to you, you must know they are absolutely

10
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:29,850
new to Sahaja Yoga.

11
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:38,101
So first and foremost thing, you should not
talk about Me. You should not tell them anything

12
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:49,241
about Me; but you have to tell them about
Sahaja Yoga and about yourself. Like you can

13
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:07,870
say, “I had the same problem as you have.”
Or you can say that “See, it took me more

14
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:20,331
time then it
took you.” It’s a little lie, but doesn’t
matter. [Shri Mataji laughs.] You see, because

15
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:41,631
first of all, you must understand human beings.
If you tell them directly “You are bad”

16
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:51,941
or “You are evil; you are bootish” then
they will run away, though it is true.

17
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:03,590
A lady from France came to see Me. She said
that “They told me I’m evil.” So I said,

18
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:20,111
“No, no you are not. Who told you that?”
And gradually she improved. So you have to

19
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:32,751
tell them that “You are the Spirit” and
whatever is hanging on to them will be dropped

20
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:43,131
out
and will be cleared out by their Kundalini.
So if that happens they feel happy and they

21
00:14:57,111 --> 00:15:04,111
get their benevolence. It is how beautifully
you handle another person.

22
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:18,690
Now there maybe people who want to argue.
With them you should say, “You know, you

23
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:29,970
cannot argue it out, because it is beyond
human awareness.” And you better tell them

24
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:41,301
that it is … “You better take your Realization,
then we will talk about it. Not before your

25
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:52,901
Realization.” So then, if they are not getting
any Realization, you don’t tell them that

26
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:59,901
“There is a bhoot sitting in your left Nabhi
or right Nabhi.” This is our language – Sahaja

27
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:13,940
Yogi’s language, not their language. Ya,
so you have to be very careful to handle them

28
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:24,421
very carefully.
Now there could be a problem between, say,

29
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:33,780
a sad man’s parent’s mother and a daughter
or maybe husband and wife. So …

30
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:41,901
(Just a minute, this side - listen to Me,
all right? All of you should pay attention

31
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:57,870
to Me. All right? No, no it’s all right.
Let her be there. It’s all right, but she

32
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:06,991
should pay attention this time, all right?
Sit down.)

33
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:13,991
So we have to tell them that “You carry
on, don’t worry about it, because the inner

34
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:22,470
joy will start giving you strength.”
Then gradually the another partner will understand
you -
see you’re honest, your purpose and would

35
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:54,051
try to appreciate you. Gradually it works
out. But if it does not, then we’ll see

36
00:17:58,571 --> 00:18:05,571
about it. Now when you handle them with love
and care, you can establish them. But if they

37
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:28,500
start misbehaving you also should not lose
temper at all. You should be very forgiving.

38
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:44,130
Now I must say, that in Sahaja Yoga you have
to respect your leaders. Of course, you might

39
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:57,641
not find them perfect, maybe. Or maybe
you may find them to be little bossy, possibly.
But you need some bossing sometimes. And leaders

40
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:26,881
must know how to also correct people, because
you need correction. I met a lady, I was telling

41
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,760
you, we had told them, that you need not have
a guru. So, she said “No, no we must have

42
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:52,231
somebody to guide us. And that guru will guide
us and also will support us, so we would like

43
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:06,501
to follow him. In spite of the fact he is
a very bossy fellow and he always gets annoyed

44
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:13,781
with us and he takes money from us. And it’s
not a guru, if he’s not, if he is very soft,

45
00:20:23,051 --> 00:20:30,051
means he should not be kind.”

46
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:41,691
So we have another kind also of people who
want somebody to dominate
them for their spiritual ascent. They are

47
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:59,301
better people, because they want their ascent
in any case. And they accept corrections,

48
00:21:06,981 --> 00:21:13,981
because they want their ascent. That’s the
first thing. So even if the leader bosses,

49
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:23,041
they like it very much. In some places people
told Me, “Our guru is very soft – we must

50
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:35,700
get some strong fellow.”
So I leave it to the leaders, who are called
as gurus by some people to be kind, compassionate,

51
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:07,020
good. But should not compromise with nonsense
and laziness. Because the first thing, people

52
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:21,421
get into is laziness after Sahaja Yoga. We
have to be committed. Now I too have a family

53
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:37,501
and I have grandchildren. My daughter has
come all the way to see Me in London. She’s

54
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:46,741
been there for one month and I haven’t been
there yet. She’s waiting for Me.

55
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:04,751
So it’s all right, one has to do it. This
is My commitment, because this is your purpose

56
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:17,481
of life. And the purpose that you have mainly
is to ascend and help others to ascend. You

57
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:34,341
are special people, who have to do such a
tremendous task. Otherwise how can we have

58
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:44,950
lots of people coming to Sahaja Yoga? So the
Sahaja way is to yourself improve with meditation

59
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:04,061
and introspect yourself and see yourself.
You must meditate and you should not see the

60
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:16,830
defects of others.

61
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:23,830
The second thing to be Sahaj is to be collective.
If you do not meet collectively every day,

62
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:39,940
then there will be a problem. In the collective
only the maturity starts. It is a living process

63
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:51,510
as I told you. Now supposing a tree is growing
and you take out a leaf from there and the

64
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:05,130
leaf will say, “I’m going to grow by myself.”
It cannot grow. It will be left out. So that

65
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:23,161
is what one has to remember: that it is a
collective happening. We all have to meet

66
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,781
and grow together.

67
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:37,781
Now, those who are not collective will disappear
one day into thin air, like a dead leaf. I

68
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:53,411
think people don’t understand the meaning
of collective happening. It is just like a

69
00:25:58,101 --> 00:26:05,101
tree growing and with the tree everything
else that belongs to tree also grows. So for

70
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:20,551
the growth of this tree one has to remember
that you have to stick onto the tree. But

71
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:31,291
the tree is not going to run after you, “Stick
on, stick on to me, stick on to me.” For

72
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:44,020
that whatever has to be done, has to be done.
You know, when the winter comes, all the leaves

73
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:58,510
fall off. What they do is to create a barrier
between themselves and the tree by some living

74
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:08,250
process. They create a barrier in between,
there's a little bark that comes in between.

75
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:21,411
Now when that happens the leaves fall off
and the tree becomes barren.

76
00:27:29,201 --> 00:27:36,201
Now same thing happens in Sahaja Yoga. When
you do not accept the principle of Sahaja

77
00:27:41,621 --> 00:27:48,621
Yoga you put a barrier in between the sap
and
the leaf. Now when that happens, the leaf

78
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:07,711
falls off. So you have to open out yourself,
your heart, everything to suck in the sap

79
00:28:09,471 --> 00:28:16,471
to nourish. You have to give up your Ego and
Superego, your conditionings and ideas you

80
00:28:29,031 --> 00:28:36,031
have had from before. This is what is the
surrender, is the Islam. And that is to be

81
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:53,801
achieved. But that is not going to help the
tree, it is going to help you. Now some people

82
00:28:59,021 --> 00:29:06,021
say, “I'm not ready.” Then how will you
grow? Actually when a little child is born,

83
00:29:10,191 --> 00:29:17,191
immediately it wants to suck in the mother's
nourishment. It feels it has starved all this

84
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:30,061
time and it should suck mother's milk immediately.
And all those are seekers, once they find

85
00:29:38,141 --> 00:29:45,141
their Realization must behave in that manner.
They should all give up all the conditionings

86
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:56,771
and all these nonsensical ideas and immediately
push themselves and also cleanse themselves

87
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:11,691
fully to suck in more and more of this nourishment.

88
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:22,221
But it does not happen that way. That's why
some people do not grow that fast. It is a

89
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:36,381
pure intelligence that gives you that sense
I think. Pure intelligence comes from pure

90
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:46,731
heart and if you pay more attention to your
heart, your Spirit, then it will work out.

91
00:30:55,941 --> 00:31:02,941
In the course of your movement in Sahaja Yoga
you will see you’ll be blessed. Not only

92
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:17,951
that you’ll have the blessings but you will
have jobs, you will have money or else children

93
00:31:24,571 --> 00:31:31,571
will pass with flying colors. They will become
obedient. Your health will improve, you will

94
00:31:38,251 --> 00:31:45,251
get money, you will get married, you will
have nice children, wise wife, you’ll get

95
00:31:55,501 --> 00:32:02,501
homes and ashrams. But these are all temptations.
Many people get lost in one of those. Now

96
00:32:15,841 --> 00:32:22,841
supposing I've to catch the plane and on the
way I see very nice gardens or things, then

97
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:36,391
I get down to enjoy the gardens, how will
I reach the airport and the aeroplane? So

98
00:32:42,731 --> 00:32:49,731
these temptations must be seen as just entertainments…
as entertainments. Entertainment, all right?

99
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:14,401
Now our understanding of Sahaj is simple if
you do not think about it. But if you start

100
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:33,171
thinking you’ll go mad. How can you explain
that a person just like you can give Realization

101
00:33:36,361 --> 00:33:43,361
to thousands? How can you explain that you
can see the sun on My heart in a picture?

102
00:33:55,631 --> 00:34:02,631
All this pictures which are there, how can
you explain? For example, you get My photographs

103
00:34:05,701 --> 00:34:12,701
in the sky, is a fact. How will you explain
that? So it is beyond your brains. So better

104
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:28,861
not think about it. Just gradually accept
the joy. I always say I've done the cooking

105
00:34:32,801 --> 00:34:39,801
for you and very good food. Now only thing
is for you to eat it and taste it. Why do

106
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:58,091
you want to know, how it was cooked, when
it was kept and what else has been done to

107
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:05,761
make it so tasty? You should just appreciate
and enjoy. Like a painting you have, you don't

108
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:25,891
think, “From where did he get the paint,
how did he paint and how was he sitting, what

109
00:35:34,921 --> 00:35:38,341
food he must have taken, before or after?”

110
00:35:38,341 --> 00:35:45,341
But in Sahaja Yoga we do these ridiculous
things, you know. It's very surprising, that

111
00:35:52,241 --> 00:35:59,071
people do not understand one simple thing:
that Kundalini has risen without thinking

112
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:06,071
and not by our effort. The Kundalini has given
us this good health, good temperament and

113
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:25,441
has changed us so much. So She is going to
do the job, only thing we should try to support

114
00:36:29,761 --> 00:36:36,761
Her and to keep our central path clean. It's
very simple.

115
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:49,641
So now I feel very much encouraged to that
from Holland and from Belgium we have such

116
00:36:50,031 --> 00:36:55,991
nice Sahaja Yogis here, and also I would say
it is rather difficult for some people to

117
00:36:55,991 --> 00:37:02,261
come to India. But try to come, because those
who have been to India have settled down much

118
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:09,261
better, because India has got something magical
about it, that it transforms people to a deeper

119
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:17,791
level. You should not come half heartedly.
I feel that those who can come on [literally??

120
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:16,061
– UNCLEAR] should not find excuses, “I'm
not ready, I'm not thinking”, because such

121
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:23,061
half hearted people are not going to gain
anything. You
have to come with full force, as I told you

122
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:40,611
the newly born child, otherwise it is useless.
Don't play into the tricks of your mind. It's

123
00:38:53,101 --> 00:39:00,101
like a donkey - if you take a donkey lightly,
then it will just start grazing anywhere it

124
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:12,741
finds grass. And if it knows that the person
sitting on his back is a lousy fellow or a

125
00:39:20,731 --> 00:39:27,731
lazy person, it will drop him. And when it
knows that it can go ahead of the person then

126
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:41,921
it can even kick you back. That is how your
mind is. It dominates you, it sometimes starts

127
00:39:52,531 --> 00:39:59,531
grazing on pastures and you think that's a
very good thing, you are very peaceful or

128
00:40:05,061 --> 00:40:12,061
else it starts dominating you. So how to manage
this donkey? Best way is to catch hold of

129
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:29,381
the ears, and carry it with you. Donkey is
for you, you are not for the donkey. So this

130
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:46,791
is one of the hurdles, that we have very much.

131
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:57,681
As far as you all are concerned you have to
know that Sahaja Yoga is to be understood

132
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:07,661
not by brain, but by heart. I have known people
who can give big lectures on Sahaja Yoga,

133
00:41:17,331 --> 00:41:24,331
can write books, but have no vibrations. So
this is not the way Sahaja Yoga is. You have

134
00:41:26,911 --> 00:41:33,911
to be a Yogi. That's a religion in a way in
our being. That's the religion of a Yogi.

135
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:53,191
Like human beings have ten valencies, a Yogi
must have at least eleven valencies. And the

136
00:41:58,631 --> 00:42:05,631
eleventh valency integrates you with the religion.
You get identified with righteousness, with

137
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:25,531
compassion, with love, with assiduity - perseverance
- or also detachment. That means you do not

138
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:51,301
expect anything. You do it for doing’s sake.
You love for loving’s sake. That's the best

139
00:42:57,821 --> 00:43:04,821
way to enjoy. You enjoy your loving capacity.
You enjoy your generosity. You enjoy your

140
00:43:14,471 --> 00:43:21,471
forgiveness. Enjoy all these great qualities
of righteousness. You’ll never feel hurt.

141
00:43:34,891 --> 00:43:41,891
I do that all the time. That's how I'm always
happy and full of joy.

142
00:43:46,241 --> 00:43:50,301
May God bless you!
