1
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:50,693
Today is a great day

2
00:00:50,693 --> 00:01:02,333
when we are celebrating Mahalakshmi’s Puja.

3
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:16,633
You must be knowing that today is the day of Mary, mother of Christ, who was Mahalakshmi.

4
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:39,953
Mahalakshmi’s incarnation is very important for Sahaja Yoga.

5
00:01:39,953 --> 00:01:43,633
First She establishes our dharma

6
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:53,633
by which we become righteous,

7
00:01:58,253 --> 00:02:02,593
we become religious in the real sense.

8
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:14,933
After the light of Realisation we cannot do anything that is not dharma.

9
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:25,473
As you know what is dharma is,

10
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:33,713
and the maryadas, the boundaries of our behavior.

11
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:42,913
This transformation takes place automatically.

12
00:02:46,113 --> 00:02:51,553
I don’t have to tell you, “Don’t do this, don’t do this,” like ten commandments.

13
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,793
You, yourself, establish your dharma

14
00:03:03,413 --> 00:03:05,633
and you enjoy your virtues.

15
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:14,513
This happens, as you know – already has happened to all of you

16
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:21,413
with the grace of Mahalakshmi.

17
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:27,553
Then She starts bestowing blessings on you

18
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:35,033
First the blessing is of physical well-being

19
00:03:49,393 --> 00:04:01,933
by which your parasympathetic nervous system gets into proper shape

20
00:04:08,893 --> 00:04:11,053
and a balance is established,

21
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:19,753
as if the Mahalakshmi principle holds the reins

22
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:24,733
and you cannot cross the limits,

23
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:31,093
you cannot go too much to the left or to the right.

24
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:42,213
By this principle you realise what is wrong with the outside religions,

25
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:51,873
you realise also that inside

26
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:57,573
all the religions are born

27
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:02,993
like flowers on the same of tree of spirituality.

28
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:09,713
And automatically you start worshipping

29
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:13,933
all the prophets

30
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:18,633
right from Abraham, Moses,

31
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:32,453
Confucius, Lao Tse, Mohammed Sahib, Nanak.

32
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:36,573
You worship them!

33
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:41,633
It is not that you have respect, but you worship,

34
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:49,633
and thus you lose the barriers of fundamentalism.

35
00:05:56,633 --> 00:06:06,633
By the ascent, with this principle, you achieve a personality by which you become a universal being.

36
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:17,833
You understand the problems of your country

37
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:24,633
and of your race, and you transcend

38
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:31,033
to see what’s wrong with them and how to correct them.

39
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:42,233
When the Mahalakshmi principle is awakened we realise

40
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:53,633
that outside we may be different but inside we are just the same.

41
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:05,633
All the masters and prophets are just the same,

42
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:12,633
whatever religion they might have been born.

43
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:30,633
Now this Mahalakshmi principle goes out of gear because of left or right side movement of our attention.

44
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:44,633
Even people come to Sahaja Yoga and they start going either to the left or to the right.

45
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:53,573
One has to keep a proper watch,

46
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:58,633
because you have come to Sahaja Yoga to ascend.

47
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:11,333
Now, if you move to the right side then you start fighting with your leader,

48
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:17,453
finding faults with the leader,

49
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:25,633
and, as Christ has said, you become ‘murmuring souls’ – you start talking ill about your leader.

50
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:33,993
I have appointed Myself the leaders,

51
00:08:37,213 --> 00:08:41,913
and I know what’s wrong with them or what’s not wrong with them.

52
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:47,113
They are in close contact with Me,

53
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:53,073
so you don’t have to judge them,

54
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:58,713
by that you are hampering the progress

55
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:04,653
of Sahaja Yoga and your own.

56
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:14,853
Then there are other people who try to find out new methods.

57
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:25,493
Such people are extremely difficult

58
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:32,773
because their ego, conditions them so much that they don’t see what’s wrong with them,

59
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:45,373
and they don’t know they are doing anti-God activities.

60
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:55,373
They are not creating problem for themselves but for others also.

61
00:09:58,353 --> 00:10:02,373
Anybody who starts like this

62
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:06,453
suffers a lot,

63
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:09,813
there is no joy on their face,

64
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:14,853
they just try to show off

65
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:21,273
and it is very, very dangerous!

66
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:30,633
I have seen people who have tried all these tricks and fallen into lots of problems

67
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:38,433
because Sahaja Yoga has it’s own culture,

68
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:44,033
it has it’s own methods

69
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:50,293
which are absolutely approved by Me.

70
00:10:54,393 --> 00:10:58,233
There is no need to start some new methods,

71
00:11:00,853 --> 00:11:03,453
if so they should get out of Sahaja Yoga.

72
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:09,153
This is the worst type of ego!

73
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:17,013
And one should not have anything to do with such people.

74
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:23,193
Already everything has been researched in Sahaja Yoga.

75
00:11:26,273 --> 00:11:29,773
All the knowledge is already there,

76
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:40,593
but this comes from a kind of a ego which doesn’t feel the vibrations very well,

77
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:48,633
and then you try to push away from the Mahalakshmi principle.

78
00:11:55,673 --> 00:12:07,733
The left side people, when they move, they fall into the trap of other type of gurus or other type of readings, even in Sahaja Yoga.

79
00:12:15,253 --> 00:12:22,733
Sometimes people who’ll get too much attached to their wives, to their children, to their family, too much attached,

80
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,093
they become very left-sided.

81
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:37,073
They have no joy and they don’t want others to enjoy.

82
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:43,833
Such people also should go out of Sahaja Yoga.

83
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:51,633
Till they have overcome their attachments they should not be in Sahaja Yoga.

84
00:12:57,353 --> 00:13:13,773
Mahalakshmi principle is extremely helpful, extremely nourishing and is the only way we can achieve our realisation and enlightenment

85
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:29,033
but one has to have proper balance.

86
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:44,613
In the beginning Mahalakshmi principle incarnated on this earth as the wife of Shri Rama – Shri Sita.

87
00:13:54,093 --> 00:14:00,073
Then came the second incarnation at the time of Shri Krishna as Radha,

88
00:14:05,213 --> 00:14:10,493
‘Ra’ is energy, ‘dha’ is the one which sustains.

89
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:22,113
And then came the incarnation of Mahalakshmi, is the Mother of Christ.

90
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:34,633
The Christianity has failed because they did not recognise the powers of Mary.

91
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:44,653
This Paul was a hater of women

92
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,893
and showed no respect to women.

93
00:14:52,633 --> 00:15:02,893
As a result of that, the women who are following so-called Christianity became very insecure.

94
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:17,013
Of course in Catholic Church, as you know, a woman is not, cannot become, a priest,

95
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:33,153
and also in the Protestant Church they don’t want to accept women as priests – big, big fight going on!

96
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:42,633
Even in the Orthodox Church they treat women as dirt.

97
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:50,013
As a result women in the West have become extremely insecure.

98
00:15:54,873 --> 00:16:05,073
The way they accept to be nude, to expose their body, to sell their body, because they are so insecure, they have no identity.

99
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:21,073
If supposing in India a man tries to have relationship with another woman, the wife says“All right, you go to hell, I don’t care.

100
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:34,313
You are committing a sin, all right, go ahead, I have nothing to do with you,”

101
00:16:37,753 --> 00:16:40,773
and the whole society will support that way,

102
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:48,573
but in the west the position of woman is really, really very, very low,

103
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:55,433
absolutely primitive.

104
00:16:57,713 --> 00:17:05,333
They are mothers, they are sisters, they are grandmothers, they are daughters and wives.

105
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:17,353
I didn’t understand why the women in the west are so anxious to attract the men.

106
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:27,673
In India if any man looks at the woman she’ll go and slap his face.

107
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:45,233
This insecurity is so much that I have seen in films women becoming nude everywhere, they have all kinds of nude clubs and all that, but men never become, men never.

108
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:11,373
That I’ve seen films where women will become nude and show vulgarity, everything acceptably nonsense, while men were never take out their clothes.

109
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:29,673
As if the body of men is something special and the body of women is not to be respected.

110
00:18:35,393 --> 00:18:38,333
It is a very primitive idea.

111
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:47,113
I can’t understand this, because it is the Adi Shakti who has created this Universe

112
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:54,193
not Sadashiva.

113
00:18:56,373 --> 00:19:05,773
Even if women are not respected and they are not respectable, the Gods cannot reside in that country.

114
00:19:15,473 --> 00:19:21,433
So, we have to understand that women should have their own dignity

115
00:19:25,793 --> 00:19:35,873
and they should not yield to the pressures of men where they try to debase them.

116
00:19:43,593 --> 00:19:53,733
But at the same time they must respect their husbands, their men-folk, and they have to be extremely loving and compassionate.

117
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:12,633
Now, in the Western thinking they can’t understand a Immaculate Conception,

118
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:19,533
they don’t understand God.

119
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:26,633
It is God, and Divinity can do anything!

120
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:42,413
As you know Shri Ganesha was created by Parvati Herself, without Her husband,

121
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:53,393
and Indians do not doubt it.

122
00:20:56,153 --> 00:20:59,173
After all He’s God

123
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:03,273
and She is Adi Shakti.

124
00:21:05,093 --> 00:21:08,813
Now you see so many miracle photographs have come,

125
00:21:11,893 --> 00:21:14,933
for you to see for yourself

126
00:21:16,353 --> 00:21:19,833
that there are miracles created,

127
00:21:22,953 --> 00:21:29,213
not in the photographs otherwise also you have seen so many miracles happening in Sahaja Yoga.

128
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:44,053
When I told that Ganesha is our Lord Jesus Christ, people would not believe it.

129
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:58,973
So I said symbolically, if you see from the right to the left, you will see Swastika

130
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:04,933
on the Mooladhara,

131
00:22:06,053 --> 00:22:08,673
which is made of carbon atom.

132
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:16,633
And if you can make a photograph of a carbon atom,

133
00:22:19,753 --> 00:22:25,133
and see it from right to the left, you do see the Swastika.

134
00:22:29,273 --> 00:22:31,213
This is the fact,

135
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:34,813
is established

136
00:22:35,753 --> 00:22:39,853
and if you see from the left to the right it is Omkara,

137
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:50,693
so thus what I’ve said is verified, scientifically.

138
00:22:54,313 --> 00:23:03,013
But if you see from down below upward, then what do you see is the Alpha and Omega.

139
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:13,193
Now Christ has said, “I am the Alpha and I am the Omega.”

140
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:23,933
I do not know even at that time there was talk of alpha and omega

141
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:31,973
but now it is scientifically proved.

142
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:42,613
There are many other things about soul and everything – now we have scientifically proved it.

143
00:23:47,413 --> 00:23:50,493
Also now they are working on genes

144
00:23:52,633 --> 00:24:03,613
and they have found out that a person who is evil, who is wrong, who is not normal is because of a bad gene.

145
00:24:11,153 --> 00:24:13,673
That is what is the bhoot.

146
00:24:17,453 --> 00:24:24,073
So this how, you see, science is coming closer to Sahaja Yoga,

147
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:34,573
but scientists find it very difficult to accept Me.

148
00:24:37,653 --> 00:24:43,413
They can’t understand that I could be the source of Divine power.

149
00:24:48,173 --> 00:24:54,793
Till you have vibrations, how can you feel, how can you understand?

150
00:25:01,353 --> 00:25:06,833
Despite that, now Sahaja Yoga is spreading in 55 countries,

151
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:21,033
but the most important thing is to keep your Mahalakshmi principle clean and open.

152
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:44,353
That is, a woman who is Mahalakshmi is a very good housewife, very good queen, Raja Lakshmi. There are ashta Lakshmis, there are eight forms of Lakshmi,

153
00:25:49,933 --> 00:26:00,433
and these eight forms of Lakshmi are to be expressed, manifested by a Sahaja Yogini.

154
00:26:06,993 --> 00:26:10,193
And the men must respect

155
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:15,213
this Mahalakshmi principle within them.

156
00:26:17,773 --> 00:26:21,573
First of all they have to be dharmic

157
00:26:25,113 --> 00:26:29,353
and the basis of dharma is respect,

158
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:36,413
must develop respect and dedication.

159
00:26:40,913 --> 00:26:47,573
If you cannot surrender and detach, you cannot enter into Mahalakshmi channel.

160
00:26:52,873 --> 00:26:57,293
Either you will be money-oriented or power-oriented.

161
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:14,873
So, you have to be detached from money and power

162
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:26,413
then Mahalakshmi principle starts working and you become a seeker.

163
00:27:32,553 --> 00:27:38,573
On every chakra Mahalakshmi gives you Her blessings,

164
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:52,673
but at the Sahasrara She gives you the collective-consciousness.

165
00:27:57,713 --> 00:28:06,213
She makes you deft in Sahaja Yoga practice and also understanding.

166
00:28:12,753 --> 00:28:19,913
I have seen, gradually, Sahaja Y ogis have become very subtle and I can talk to them on a very subtle level.

167
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:40,973
I am so happy, today, we are here to celebrate Mahalakshmi principle at the time of Mother Mary’s birthday.

168
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:56,593
She passed through the greatest ordeal to see Her son being crucified

169
00:29:02,313 --> 00:29:07,733
but She knew what was the purpose of His crucifixion

170
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:12,713
and She accepted.

171
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:22,713
I can’t see a cross, if somebody is wearing a cross I said “Take out cross!”,

172
00:29:28,473 --> 00:29:35,713
because the message of Christ is resurrection and not crucifixion.

173
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:54,893
But perhaps the Christians, especially Paul must have thought that he should use cross to make everybody feel guilty.

174
00:30:04,113 --> 00:30:09,373
This Paul has really done so much harm that,

175
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:16,953
only after reading a treatise of ‘Nag Nagamani of Hammadi’,

176
00:30:16,953 --> 00:30:28,233
I found out that Thomas had to run away to India to tell the truth.

177
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:46,293
With this Mahalakshmi principle our attention should be on our virtues,

178
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:55,893
and we must enjoy our generosity.

179
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:03,913
We must enjoy our purity.

180
00:31:07,353 --> 00:31:14,193
We should enjoy our innocence and chastity – even men have to do that.

181
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:25,633
We should enjoy our detachments.

182
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:36,233
All this is already within your reach.

183
00:31:40,793 --> 00:31:49,253
I’ve felt these people, when they were dancing, that they are all from Kashmir in, from,India

184
00:31:56,733 --> 00:32:01,953
and Adi Shakti incarnated first in Kashmir.

185
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:09,713
I find Bulgarians very close to Indians.

186
00:32:13,493 --> 00:32:15,853
And also Romanians.

187
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:27,853
Your talent in music I’ve seen, and that’s why you all can sing Indian music so easily.

188
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:43,593
I bless you, all Sahaja Yogis, that you develop a proper sense of balance

189
00:32:49,693 --> 00:32:56,193
and that you spread Sahaja Yoga all over Bulgaria,

190
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:04,073
making everyone joyous and happy as you are.

191
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,533
We have to change the world.

192
00:33:13,913 --> 00:33:16,433
It’s a tremendous task,

193
00:33:17,993 --> 00:33:25,393
is the greatest event in the history of spirituality

194
00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:32,413
and you are the participant of that,

195
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:41,093
so you have to understand that your purity is very important

196
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:49,793
and your surrendering

197
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:57,173
will definitely help you to ascend, faster and faster.

198
00:34:03,473 --> 00:34:06,473
So may God bless you!
