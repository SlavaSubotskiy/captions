00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,000

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
now what is it

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,720

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:45,840
i don't know

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,200
[Applause]

7
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:59,840
you see inside me is complete peace

8
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,840
and complete satisfaction

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:19,040
but the ripples of that joy

10
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,040
flows outward all the time

11
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,240
and when it reaches your shores you see

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,159
pattern is beautiful

17
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,840
it's delicate it's powerful

18
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,040
and it leaves the complete beauty of

20
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,840

and i really swing with it

22
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,959
