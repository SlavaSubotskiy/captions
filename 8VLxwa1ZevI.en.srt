1
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,920
Yesterday I told you about this chakra

2
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,880
which is a very fiery chakra, because

3
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,680
this chakra is occupied by a very fiery deity

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,680
called as Jagadamba - is the Mother of the universe.

5
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,400
She has to protect Her children,

6
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,200
who are trying to swim across the ocean of illusion

7
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,520
and who are being always hampered by

8
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,880
the people who are against God,

9
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,720
who are anti-Christ, who are anti-God,

10
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,400
who are devils, who are called as rakshasas.

11
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,600
And so She has to protect them

12
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,480
and that's why She is such a fiery Goddess,

13
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,400
like a tigress.

14
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,640
Actually one of Her conveyances is a tiger, another is a lion.

15
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,320
After that now, today we want to know about this chakra,

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,200
which is the Vishuddhi Chakra - Vishuddhi.

17
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,880
America in the map of the world

18
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,160
is this center, this Vishuddhi Chakra.

19
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,400
That's why it is important to understand,

20
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,240
what do we stand for - Americans.

21
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,240
Now this center has got sixteen sub-plexuses

22
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,120
and it manifests in the gross the cervical plexus,

23
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,200
which looks after all the ear, nose, throat, the eyeballs

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,360
and the neck, all the problems of this area.

25
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,880
The facial construction

26
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,160
depends on this chakra.

27
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,720
Whatever is the condition of this center,

28
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,760
you have the expression on your face.

29
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,280
As I told you, it has got sixteen sub-plexuses

30
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,480
and all the vowels are created in this center.

31
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,280
Of course the English language has got the vowels

32
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,800
which are not scientifically alright.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,880
But the Devanagari script has got all the vowels,

34
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,960
are sixteen in number.

35
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,240
And that's why they are all produced here in this area.

36
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,480
This is the gross side of this center.

37
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,080
The subtle side of this center is,

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,480
that this is the center of collectivity.

39
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,800
When man raises his head, he sees around himself

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,040
his fellow men,

41
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,320
and he starts thinking

42
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,120
that there must be something very very common between us.

43
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,520
That we are part and parcel of one universal being

44
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,480
of the great Primordial personality.

45
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,840
The central path of Sushumna of ascendance

46
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,120
creates this Primordial Being ultimately, is the final,

47
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,880
is the complete form of this ascendance,

48
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,600
of the evolution, ends up here.

49
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,800
So this is the Primordial Being,

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
if we say this is the Primordial Being

51
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,720
and this is the Primordial Vishuddhi,

52
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,040
then this Vishuddhi is the one that represents

53
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,840
what Muslims say as the Akbar... Akbar aspect of God.

54
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,200
The Primordial Great Being.

55
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,760
In Sanskrit language it is called as Virat.

56
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,960
Now, this Primordial Being incarnated on this earth,

57
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,080
as I told you that all this aspect incarnates,

58
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,760
the central aspect on this earth as Shri Krishna.

59
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,840
And His power was Radha.

60
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,800
Ra means energy, Dha means the one who sustains it.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,960
Radha - means the one who sustains the energy, is Radha.

62
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,760
So on the center is Shri Krishna and Radha.

63
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,160
On the right side is His image as a king,

64
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,080
when He went away from

65
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,520
Gokul and Mathura after killing a devil

66
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,760
called Kansa, who was His uncle actually.

67
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,720
He went down to Gujarat and settled down there

68
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,800
and ruled that country, there He was called as Vitthala,

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,080
Vitthala and Rukmini.

70
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,600
I'm telling you these names because

71
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,320
when you are raising the Kundalini,

72
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,960
if the chakra stops there or Kundalini stops there,

73
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,520
you have to take His name.

74
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,400
On the left hand side is His sister,

75
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,080
who was just born and was killed again

76
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,520
and She appears to us as a lightning in the sky.

77
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,480
She's called as Vishnumaya.

78
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,320
All these three centers are very, very important.

79
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,960
When you are collective,

80
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,360
then you are ascending through this center.

81
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,440
The power is passing through this.

82
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,680
Actually the root of this starts from here.

83
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,400
The root starts from here and grows into this

84
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,360
and then into this, crossing over.

85
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,160
The crossing over takes there,

86
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,120
but the root of the Ego and Super-Ego starts at this point.

87
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,240
Shri Krishna, as we know, appeared to Arjuna

88
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,160
as a Virata, as the Great Primordial Being.

89
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,840
He saw Him as a very huge, big personality.

90
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,360
And he saw in Him

91
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,800
all the human beings and all the creations moving about.

92
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,640
And he couldn't bear it anymore, he said,

93
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,360
"I don't want to see it again."

94
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,280
Shri Krishna told the Gita,

95
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,120
spoke the Gita only to Arjuna, only to one person.

96
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,720
He didn't tell it to even the second person,

97
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,720
because He was born 6,000 years back.

98
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,640
That time the maturity of people was so low,

99
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,320
that He did not tell about this to anybody else but Arjuna.

100
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,720
And this was heard by another person, who wrote it down

101
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,000
and Vyasa is the poet, who wrote about it.

102
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,520
The Gita is the Vedanta - means the end of Vedas.

103
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,440
Vedas have got two sides.

104
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,360
The first side is where the mantras are there

105
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,760
to excite the right side or we can say the elements

106
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,080
and the end of it is the philosophy.

107
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,080
And He used that philosophy of Gita.

108
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,040
He used that Vedanta philosophy in Gita

109
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,800
to explain what is knowledge,

110
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,600
what is God, what is Spirit,

111
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,680
how to achieve it, and what happens.

112
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,520
Now, Krishna's basic character of

113
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,480
His advent, was that.

114
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,480
So far for Rama,

115
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,120
He was the one who lived like a human being,

116
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,240
and established a

117
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,960
special place

118
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,000
or say established a special character

119
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,640
of a benevolent king, for other kings to follow.

120
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,960
But this one, when He came

121
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,480
He found that the whole place was filled with ritualism,

122
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,960
with all kinds of dead

123
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,400
supraconscious activities and subconscious activities,

124
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
and people were indulging into

125
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,200
materialistic things and were very unhappy.

126
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,360
So, He established Himself

127
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,200
as the incarnation of the play - leela.

128
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,400
That the whole world is just a drama.

129
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,040
It's just a drama and you are a witness to it.

130
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,200
Actually what happens when you watch a drama,

131
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,200
you feel that you are in it.

132
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,520
Supposing there is Napoleon

133
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,200
or somebody who is in the drama.

134
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,840
You start feeling you are Napoleon and even when you go home,

135
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,840
you talk like Napoleon for a while.

136
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,960
You carry on the joke with you.

137
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,440
But it's a drama, it's outside you. It is not you.

138
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,840
Sometimes when there is, say, a cinema or something we see,

139
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,560
we identify ourselves with the scene so much that we cry,

140
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,880
weep, sometimes feeling very excited.

141
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,440
But when the drama is over

142
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,160
then we'll suddenly realize, "Oh God, it was a drama."

143
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,320
In the same way this whole life, human life is a drama.

144
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,320
And the whole drama

145
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,640
is only seen when you get your Realization, you become a witness.

146
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,600
Now those who have got Realization,

147
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,040
should understand that you have become now a witness.

148
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,880
Start seeing everything and you'll be amazed,

149
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,680
you'll feel "Oh, I'm so much away, I'm just witnessing."

150
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,040
There's a Sahaja yogini who came from India

151
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,400
and she had never travelled before anywhere,

152
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,400
even by plane she had never travelled before.

153
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,040
And comes from a very traditional family,

154
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,160
she has never been out without somebody going with her.

155
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,400
Such a person.

156
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,600
She got her Realization and she came to America.

157
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,600
She told me that I never felt that I was going to America,

158
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,520
that I was going by plane anywhere,

159
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,200
that I should be frightened. Nothing of the kind.

160
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,960
And they were all telling me be careful,

161
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,200
I was wondering what are they worried about.

162
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,760
I was least bothered, the whole thing looked like a drama,

163
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
I got into the plane, I came here

164
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,760
and there was a sea of human beings, I couldn't see my brother,

165
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,400
and I think I got lost.

166
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
I said, "Alright, if I'm lost doesn't matter.

167
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,080
I'm never lost because I'm with myself."

168
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,040
So I was going to the taxi fellow,

169
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,960
I was going to tell him,"Take me down to my brother's place,"

170
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,840
then suddenly the brother got her, got to her and found her.

171
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,280
But otherwise she was saying "I was so relaxed,

172
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
I was least bothered,

173
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,160
most surprising I was witnessing the whole drama,

174
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,200
without any, without any consideration about it

175
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,200
or any awareness about it, I was just doing it automatically."

176
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,160
That's what happens to you.

177
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,040
You see the death, and you see the life, and you see the drama.

178
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,160
And you do not get involved with it.

179
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,280
When you are not involved into it,

180
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,800
then you are completely at ease and at peace.

181
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,160
As I gave you the example, that if you are in the water,

182
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,480
then you are worried about the waves.

183
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,360
But supposing you get into the boat,

184
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,200
then you see the waves as fun.

185
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,640
Or if you know how to swim, also you can see it as a fun.

186
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,400
So when you get realized, when you get your realization,

187
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,240
then the whole thing becomes like a drama

188
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,320
and you start developing your detachment.

189
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,520
So He's the Yogeshwara.

190
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,480
He's the one, who is fully, detachment. He's a full detachment.

191
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,400
Though He was a king.

192
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,400
Though He was having a very luxurious life,

193
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
He was a detached personality.

194
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,840
Now He, on this earth, when He came,

195
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,960
He had to have His powers with Him.

196
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,440
And He didn't know, how to bring those powers in human beings,

197
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,600
because He knew, He wouldn't be able to give Realization to people

198
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,080
at that time 6,000 years back.

199
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:22,400
So, He created a method by which He got 16,000 wives.

200
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,880
And all these wives were nothing but His powers carrying people.

201
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,800
And there's a big story about it, which

202
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,280
I think every Indian knows and you can also find out.

203
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,360
He had five, I mean He became the king, He did all this,

204
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,600
and He had five elements as His wives.

205
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,240
So His own queens, five of them, were five elements

206
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,760
and 16,000 wives were actually His own powers

207
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,880
manifested as human beings.

208
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,120
And He came on this earth as Krishna.

209
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,120
"Krishi" - Krishi means agriculture, means actually sowing.

210
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,400
He sowed the seed, He sowed the seed of spirituality.

211
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,400
He said, "Nainam Chindanti Shastrani,

212
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,200
nainam Dahati Pavakah,

213
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
na Chainam Kledayanty apo,

214
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,400
na Shosayati Marutah."

215
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,000
Means this Spirit cannot be killed, it cannot be sucked in,

216
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,000
it cannot be destroyed,

217
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,080
neither it can be transformed - it's eternal.

218
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,360
And to prove that, Christ came on this earth at this point,

219
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,880
and He by His resurrection proved it that it cannot be killed.

220
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,200
Now I will tell you about Shri Krishna's life as a diplomat.

221
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
He was a diplomat.

222
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,080
He was an incarnation of diplomacy.

223
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,800
And the best diplomacy is such,

224
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,360
that you give such conditions which are absurd.

225
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,000
If you give absurd conditions,

226
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,920
then a person gets toppled down over it,

227
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,920
and then he succumbs.

228
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,320
Because if you approach directly someone

229
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,520
then the people are very half-baked,

230
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,240
and they start intellectualizing everything and rationalizing.

231
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,200
So better thing is put a proposition before them

232
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,760
which is absurd, and let them find out for themselves

233
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,720
and then they come to you with surrendered mind.

234
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,240
Now I'll explain to you how.

235
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,800
Arjuna was His disciple,

236
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,680
and Arjuna when he went to war

237
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,480
with Kauravas, who were the Satanic forces in those days,

238
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,280
got into a mood of despondence and he said that,

239
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,720
"These are... in these are my relations,

240
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,680
these are... there's my, one of my Gurus,

241
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,400
who taught me how to use the arrow

242
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,520
and how am I to fight these people?"

243
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,880
So then He told the Gita, that time He spoke the Gita to him.

244
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,720
And He said that - the first thing He said,

245
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,000
that you should find your Self. You must have self-knowledge.

246
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,680
You should get realization.

247
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,600
You should have the knowledge.

248
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,760
Knowledge doesn't mean the idea about this architecture and all,

249
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,960
but knowledge is the awareness of your Spirit.

250
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,760
So Arjuna being a,

251
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,800
that time a mediocre I should say, an intellectual,

252
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,080
He asked Him a question,

253
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
as usual intellectuals are good at asking questions -

254
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,760
never giving answers.

255
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,840
So the intellectual asked Him,

256
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,880
that, "You are telling us to go to war,

257
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,400
and here you are telling me to find my Spirit.

258
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,520
How do these two things meet, because according to many people

259
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,080
- who are talking today also -

260
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,320
that a man who is realized should not fight.

261
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,600
He should sit down

262
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,280
and bear all the brunts of the things upon himself.

263
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,520
He should suffer."

264
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,360
So he said that, "How do You say, that I become the Spirit

265
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,720
and then I have to fight these evil forces?

266
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,400
Why should I fight these evil forces then?"

267
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,280
So He said that, alright,

268
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,280
he the person who's a mediocre

269
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,440
is very difficult to tell him how to do it.

270
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,480
Actually it is very simple.

271
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,480
When you are a witness you can fight better.

272
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
You have to fight the evil forces.

273
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,040
Why are you enlightened, if you cannot fight the darkness.

274
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,960
You have been made a light to fight the darkness

275
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,800
and not to be happy with yourself,

276
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,960
"Oh I'm the light... I'm the light... I'm the light..."

277
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,200
But you have to fight the darkness.

278
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,440
And this they would not accept,

279
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,200
that why should we fight the darkness, so He said, "All right.

280
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,720
What you do, is to do what you want to do

281
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:56,240
and put the fruit of your doing at the Lotus Feet of the Lord.

282
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,200
Now this is absurd, this is an absurd condition.

283
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,680
Like you do your karmas,

284
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,960
but put the fruit of that at the Lotus Feet of the Lord

285
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,040
- which is an absurd condition, you just can't do it.

286
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,040
Why? Because you have got Mr. Ego sitting down there.

287
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,440
Whenever you do something,

288
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,760
you always say you are doing it.

289
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,240
And even if you say, "Oh I've married Christ,

290
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,520
and this is God's work I'm doing".

291
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,000
You may say it.

292
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,560
But in your heart of hearts, it is not so.

293
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,400
Because you have not got that hollow personality,

294
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,040
where there is no Ego.

295
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,040
You must get rid of this Ego otherwise you are doing the work

296
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,640
and you're conscious - it's a myth,

297
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,280
actually human beings don't do anything whatsoever.

298
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,840
It's a myth.

299
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,680
For example we have built this beautiful church.

300
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,400
Now what have you got.

301
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,360
Whatever was created by God,

302
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,160
you just changed the forms of that and put it -

303
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,080
dead from the dead.

304
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,880
What living work have you done?

305
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,400
You cannot transform one flower into a fruit.

306
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,760
Can you? So it's a myth.

307
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,360
We believe in that we do this, we do that, we do this.

308
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,480
Actually you don't do anything.

309
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,520
You only change forms of the dead from this to that.

310
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,000
And this myth that you have got, that you do,

311
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,360
accumulates here as this bright colored stuff on your head.

312
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,200
It can be quite big, here it is shown - can be so big as that,

313
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,200
even bigger than your body,

314
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,760
bigger than this, big dome.

315
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,600
The one, who must have made this one, must have been -

316
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,680
maybe having a bigger thing than that,

317
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,880
can be possible, you see, and then you walk like this on the road,

318
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,760
you don't know how to balance yourself.

319
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,640
With all this big thing on your head all the time, this

320
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,760
Ego telling you, "Oh, you are the great."

321
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,520
And you meet such a person, better be careful.

322
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,880
Keep away from people who have done great works.

323
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,200
Otherwise they will use you for something else.

324
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,280
So keep away from all such people. That's what is the best.

325
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,240
So this Mr. Ego develops into a big...

326
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,560
And when it develops, it just gives you ideas, that -

327
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,760
first of all it makes you think "Oh you are great,

328
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,120
you are very great."

329
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,440
And then sometimes you get punches on it,

330
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,880
because people don't accept you

331
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,320
as that great as you think yourself to be.

332
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Then with a punch it grows even bigger,

333
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,760
with one more punch, it's like a rubber balloon,

334
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,680
you see, you punch, it goes up again you punch it, it...

335
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,280
Both ways is horrible.

336
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,200
It can be pumped in or it can be punched in.

337
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,240
And once it is punched in, then it can be very very big,

338
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,200
and then you don't know what to do, so you recoil down

339
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,600
into your Left Vishuddhi here.

340
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,680
Then you'll say, "Oh I should not have done it,"

341
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,560
because you think by doing that your ego is hurt.

342
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,720
You just go there to feel guilty,

343
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,680
because you think by doing that your ego is hurt.

344
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Your image is spoilt, your so-called image of this big balloon

345
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,200
is spoilt so you feel hurt.

346
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,880
Now this happening of giving it

347
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,480
or to, surrendering it at the lotus feet of Lord,

348
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,120
can only happen when your Realization takes place.

349
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,680
Now those people who have got Realization,

350
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,200
what do you do? You say, "Mother, it is going, it is coming."

351
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,000
"It's not going, it's not working." You become a third person.

352
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,840
You raise the Kundalini -

353
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,840
say you have a friend, you bring the friend along -

354
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,800
your friend doesn't get Realization.

355
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,280
You don't say, "I have given Realization,"

356
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,760
you don't say, "I raised the Kundalini," but what you do, is to say

357
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,520
that, "Mother, it's not yet working, it's little hot this side,

358
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,400
there's a, this finger burning, this chakra is catching."

359
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,920
But you say everything in the third person.

360
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,960
You never say, "I do it."

361
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,920
Even if your son is not realized or if your father is not realized,

362
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,920
you will say, "You know, I'm sorry, you can't get Realization,

363
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,880
it is not working," - it.

364
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,760
You become the third person.

365
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,040
And that is what it is when it flows, you say,

366
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,480
"It's flowing, it's working, it's there."

367
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,160
This is the theory, that He tried, tried to propound

368
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,880
that the whole thing should become

369
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,800
the karma should become akarma [without action],

370
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,280
like the sun, the sun shines,

371
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,720
but the sun is not conscious that it is shining.

372
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,120
It's just emitting.

373
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,080
It's not bothered, it's not conscious of it.

374
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,560
It comes, it changes so many leaves,

375
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,280
it gives them color, gives oxygen,

376
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,760
does all kinds of things and it goes back, least bothered.

377
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,160
It is just emitting,

378
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,200
it does not require any kind of a self-satisfaction,

379
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,160
that "I have done it, I am doing it."

380
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,280
That kind of a thing should happen to you,

381
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,280
when you just become an akarmi.

382
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,920
That is what you will say.

383
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,000
This is the Karma Theory of Shri Krishna.

384
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,040
But He said that, a day will come

385
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,880
when you'll get your Realization

386
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,240
and then this karma will be sucked in.

387
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,040
Christ is the embodiment of all that

388
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,640
Krishna prophesized or said. He came on this earth to prove it.

389
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:35,040
The second thing that He talked about, is about the Bhakti Yoga.

390
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,720
That you must - you worship by your this side -

391
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,080
that you must worship God,

392
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,920
That you must surrender yourself to God.

393
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,720
Now, when we say that we pray to God,

394
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,960
we ask for Him, I mean we ask everything,

395
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,720
I mean the way we ask God all the time really is something so horrible,

396
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,720
like we'll say that "Now I want to have a divorce,

397
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,200
get cancel  for my wife, or do this for..."

398
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,080
I mean all sorts of things we ask for.

399
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,880
We say that we are in the war,

400
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,080
we should win, the enemy should be lost,

401
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,640
and all sorts of things we ask from God.

402
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,160
I mean God must be fed up, the way we ask things.

403
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,240
So whatever it is, to surrender at the lotus feet of God,

404
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,240
through your worship - Krishna has been diplomatic again.

405
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,920
He said, that if you have to do bhakti worship, it should be ananya.

406
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,080
Ananya.. Now this word is the most diplomatic

407
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,960
and He used it again and again,

408
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,840
which all these scholars and all these people have missed it.

409
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,480
Ananya means when there is not the other, when you are connected.

410
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,400
You must do this surrendering, when you are connected.

411
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,480
Which is very true.

412
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,080
Without connection, if you start doing any bhakti,

413
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,600
whom are you doing the bhakti?

414
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,520
If there is no connection, supposing I'm sitting in London.

415
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,880
You are here.

416
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,800
You are writing letters after letters, letters after letters.

417
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,520
I never receive them, I never read them,

418
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,080
I've nothing to do with them.

419
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,000
So what's the use?

420
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,480
You must have some connection with God Almighty,

421
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,800
then whatever bhakti you do, it has a meaning.

422
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,560
So before Realization, the bhakti has no meaning.

423
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,160
Like these mad people "Hare Rama Hare Krishna,

424
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,920
Hare Rama Hare Krishna."

425
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,480
By saying these things if you can achieve anything,

426
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
then it is the easiest.

427
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,160
But the one thing that you spoil is this center.

428
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,640
You spoil the worst of all, and they always get throat cancer.

429
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,120
The reason is, the first of all, you spoil the center.

430
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,520
You spoil the center because you go on saying,

431
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,840
"Hare Rama Hare Krishna" too many times.

432
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,920
What is there to take God's name like that?

433
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,280
It's very very cheap thing.

434
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,840
If you are realized, you don't have to take God's name like that.

435
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,800
There's a protocol of God. If you have to take His name,

436
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,520
you have to take it properly with a protocol even after Realization.

437
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,560
But you just go on saying,

438
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,120
"Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ" all the way,

439
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,200
Christ will be so angry with you. What is it,

440
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,200
is He such a cheap thing? First of all you spoil,

441
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,640
the name - here by taking, I mean, mechanically.

442
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,320
I mean, physically you spoil this throat.

443
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,680
I mean when I also speak too much,

444
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,520
I have to get some sort of a soothing thing for my throat.

445
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,840
So you can imagine a person, who is not realized,

446
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,880
who has no idea as to what name to be taken,

447
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,360
he takes that name all the time

448
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,840
the mantras, so-called, that are given to you.

449
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,840
You get spoiled this, plus you spoil your -  this chakra,

450
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,840
because you - this left side,

451
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,040
because you have taken the unauthorized name of Shri Krishna.

452
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,600
So you are in for a throat cancer.

453
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,200
If you want to get it, you better join this Hare Rama Hare Krishna.

454
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,840
And they think they are very near to Him.

455
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,840
How will they recognize Shri Krishna?

456
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,160
But this chakra is the best among us, for one reason.

457
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,920
If this chakra is spoilt, say smoking spoils it a little bit,

458
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,400
in the beginning. If it is too much smoking, it spoils very badly.

459
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,520
Then the - from the cervical plexus

460
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,200
the nerves go down on both the sides.

461
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,480
And the sensitivity in the hands is so little,

462
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,520
that when you start feeling the vibrations,

463
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,680
you may feel a jet of air coming out of your head,

464
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,560
a great jet.

465
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,800
But in the hands you may not feel anything at all.

466
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,800
At all! There are many who just don't feel anything.

467
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,800
For the, in the beginning they just don't feel,

468
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,600
because their hands are not sensitive.

469
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,200
They have done greatest harm to their cervical plexus.

470
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,880
And that's why this chakra is stopped.

471
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,400
It doesn't give you the sensitivity.

472
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,920
Though the Kundalini has crossed through,

473
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,160
but gradually then Kundalini spreads on the sides

474
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,520
and gives energy to this center, which passes through the system,

475
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,520
and then you start feeling in the hand

476
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,040
the all-pervading Power, which is the knowledge.

477
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,600
Otherwise people don't feel it,

478
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,440
they may feel it in the head, but not in the hand.

479
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,360
I'm, I was really shocked, when I came here nine years back,

480
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:40,120
that this country was nothing but a chimney.

481
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,520
That time everyone, whether it was a woman or a man or a child,

482
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,880
everyone used to smoke.

483
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,760
And so much of smoking that really I didn't know,

484
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,600
how this Vishuddhi, the America is going to live.

485
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,560
Now please pay attention here, alright? Don't turn round your heads.

486
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,080
Now this center should be used in such a manner

487
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,400
that you keep your collectivity.

488
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,680
A person who is an individualist,

489
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,280
who keeps away from collective beings,

490
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,960
who does not give vibrations, sits at home before My photograph,

491
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,600
wants to take vibrations and all that.

492
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:29,360
Such a person will not be able to progress much in Sahaja Yoga.

493
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,360
This has an inlet and an outlet.

494
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,640
Unless and until you give, there is an outlet,

495
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,080
there will not be the inlet of vibrations.

496
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,560
With your hands you give to others.

497
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,160
Now the fourth thing Krishna has said, is the Rajayoga,

498
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,400
in which you get Kundalini awakening,

499
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,040
and you get all these chakras acting.

500
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,400
He's given actually the action into which they move.

501
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,680
Like the bandhas [tying together] take place,

502
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,880
how these chakras go and sort of

503
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,400
catch hold of the part of the Kundalini and hold it up.

504
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,520
and how these bandhas take place, all He has described.

505
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,640
Is the thing that happens, when Kundalini starts.

506
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,400
Like one can describe, that when the car starts,

507
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:27,000
the car starts moving, and all the other

508
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,720
small bolts and nuts and all of them are there,

509
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,360
they also start then moving one after another.

510
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,960
The whole mechanism, the works you can say,

511
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,280
start manifesting itself.

512
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,960
In the same way, within us, this starts working.

513
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,320
This is what He said.

514
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,320
But people are using it for Kriya Yoga [yoga through action],

515
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,560
which is nonsense. Like you sit down, hold your stomach.

516
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,320
But the Kundalini has not started.

517
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,720
Why are you holding your stomach, and hold your nose,

518
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,520
then you hold these ears.

519
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,120
What is the use? The Kundalini has not yet started,

520
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,160
why are you doing all this nonsense?

521
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,440
You see there is this, your Yogananda,

522
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,600
who has taught this nonsense to you of Kriya Yoga.

523
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,360
I mean, horrible!

524
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,920
The amount of diseases one can get from this.

525
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,760
I mean unnecessarily you shave your head.

526
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,320
Why do you shave your head?

527
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,120
By shaving your head are you going to go to God?

528
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,320
Then why has He given you hair? They shave their heads.

529
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,880
Nonsense it is, absolutely, to shave your heads.

530
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,480
The sheep is shaved every week - every year twice,

531
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,640
and by shaving your head, you are not going to go to God.

532
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,240
These all nonsensical ideas, you shave your head,

533
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,080
wear a funny dress, walk seriously like this and you'll go to God?

534
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,880
One must understand, that the happening has to take place

535
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,800
of Kundalini awakening, has to take place -

536
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,440
itself, is a spontaneous, is a living thing.

537
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,800
By doing all these artificial things,

538
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,280
you are spoiling yourself completely.

539
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,560
It automatically happens.

540
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,320
But all this mechanism you don't have to worry,

541
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,480
because once the Kundalini rises, it happens.

542
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,160
What is actually, I now feel that Krishna never knew,

543
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,360
that human beings will be so mad.

544
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,920
For example, supposing, if your car has not started,

545
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,960
do you start moving its machinery by hand?

546
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,080
And believe that the car has started moving?

547
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,400
It's the most absurd thing to do to spoil the car.

548
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,480
And that's what exactly you do, when you try to do this Kriya Yoga.

549
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,560
There is Akriya. You don't have to do any action.

550
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,840
The action takes place by itself, it is built in, it is within you.

551
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,400
I'll give you another example. Supposing there's a seed,

552
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,520
and you want to sprout it.

553
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,360
Will you try to pull the primule out of it?

554
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,520
Will it sprout? It's that senseless, I tell you.

555
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,240
The way people try to do all these tricks, standing on the head and-

556
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,200
God has given us legs to stand, not the head to stand.

557
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,080
I don't know from where this idea has come,

558
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,480
that you stand on your head.

559
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,520
By that Kundalini is never awakened.

560
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,880
It is for a certain disease, that that head standing cures you,

561
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,920
but not for everyone. It's for a cure of a disease, that's all.

562
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,040
All sorts of funny ideas. Even people drink urine.

563
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,640
I mean all sorts of things they do,

564
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,320
nonsensical things, you know, to get to Realization.

565
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,600
There was one lady of an ____ Baba,

566
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,960
he's another horrible fellow,

567
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,600
and she came to Me, she was like this, like this, like this.

568
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,280
I told her "What did you there? What did you do with this man?"

569
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,160
"Oh Mother, he blessed me specially." I said "What?"

570
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,600
"He gave me his water." I said "His water? What is his water is this?"

571
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,520
And this is the water she drank -

572
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,640
for days together, for years together.

573
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,520
And now she says, "I can't forget him."

574
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,800
Imagine to bring God to that level.

575
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,520
I mean can there be a greater blasphemy

576
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,680
and ridiculous way of treating God Almighty,

577
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,680
who has created you. There's no respect.

578
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,440
No respect.

579
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,160
You don't respect yourself, you don't respect your chastity,

580
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,200
you don't respect your private parts.

581
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,400
How can you respect God?

582
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,400
This is what it is. And they teach you not to respect.

583
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,080
And this is what happens, when you start reading Gita.

584
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,960
See, they are all blind people, blind people can't read Gita.

585
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,920
Blind people cannot read Bible. They never understand.

586
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,600
They will never understand the inner meaning of it,

587
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,360
and they'll just twist it for their own purpose.

588
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,960
Now the left hand side is the one

589
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,960
that gives you, what you call, the guilt feeling.

590
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,920
I don't know whom to blame now.

591
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,000
For example, say, the churches, the Catholic churches.

592
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,320
I mean, when did Christ say that you are guilty?

593
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,960
From where did they pick up this?

594
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,480
I cannot say from where they picked it up.

595
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,200
Christ could never have said that you are guilty,

596
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,960
that you should feel guilty, that you should suffer.

597
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,960
I mean from childhood if you tell somebody that you are guilty,

598
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,360
he'll become automatically, it's a conditioning on the person.

599
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,200
He will devise methods to find out, that what guilt he has.

600
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,200
After all you are a human being and you can make mistakes.

601
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,840
And you are blind, God knows that.

602
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,320
And He also knows, that all your mistakes are to be forgiven.

603
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,880
They are to be forgiven and you are to be given realization.

604
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,280
He is worried about His own creation. Isn't He?

605
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,680
Is He going to waste you,

606
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,280
only because you have committed some mistakes here and there?

607
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,680
And what mistakes can you commit? That also let's see.

608
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,720
He is the ocean of love.

609
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,000
He is the ocean of compassion.

610
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,360
He is the ocean of forgiveness.

611
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,360
He is ocean, and you are a drop in the ocean.

612
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,640
And how much a drop can carry a dirt, that He cannot cleanse.

613
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,200
Think of it, think of it, when you say you are guilty.

614
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,040
This is a fashion that is developed here and sometimes I find

615
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,200
this guilt is nothing but this Mr. Ego curls up into it,

616
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,240
and says alright I am guilty - finished.

617
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,680
It is not facing the fact.

618
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,600
Supposing you have done the mistake,

619
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,600
what's the use of saying, "I have done the mistake,

620
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,720
I have done the mistake, I have done the mistake."

621
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,880
Do you correct it?

622
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,720
Do you correct it by that saying that, "I have done the mistake,

623
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,600
now I have done the mistake." It would be something,

624
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,400
say we got lost in the car and we went into another road.

625
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,920
Now we sit down there crying,

626
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,960
"Oh, we have made the mistake, better sit down."

627
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,840
Here people are waiting for Me, all right, for the program,

628
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,240
and I am sitting down there crying, "We have done the mistake,

629
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,400
we have come to the wrong line, we should not have been here."

630
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,640
If I've done the mistake,

631
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,200
correct it and come back to the right position.

632
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,120
Go on correcting it.

633
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,400
Instead of that this is the best way of sitting down saying,

634
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,880
"We have done the mistake, I should not have done this,

635
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,520
I should not have done this," putting down yourself, "I can't do it,"

636
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:10,200
look to be diffident all the time, "Oh, I just can't do it."

637
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,280
This could be very dangerous. Very dangerous. For example supposing,

638
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,720
in an accident, you have harmed somebody.

639
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,960
Now you sit down there, "Oh I have done the mistake,

640
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,080
I've committed the mistake."

641
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,040
Oh please, get hold of that person whom you have harmed,

642
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,480
take him to the hospital, get him treated.

643
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,040
This is the way we do not face by feeling guilty.

644
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,280
Is a very big way of Mr. Ego to coil up into the left Vishuddhi,

645
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,520
and say, "Oh, you are guilty."

646
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,280
Who are you to judge yourself?

647
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,760
Why do you judge yourself, how do you judge yourself?

648
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,280
You have no method of judging yourself. All the time

649
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,320
you find out ways and methods of feeling diffident in life.

650
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,800
And such diffident people, what are they going to do?

651
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
You have to take swords in your hand of honesty

652
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,840
and of dedication to God's work.

653
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,840
There they are standing with the sword like this.

654
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,120
They can't even handle a little stick in their hand,

655
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,080
what are they going to do?

656
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,040
Because they are all very guilty people, all the time shaking.

657
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,160
Why to feel guilty by making yourself so diffident

658
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:29,040
and useless warrior of God's work.

659
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,040
This guilt is the worst thing and in Sahaja Yoga

660
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,880
the first mantra always I have to say, "I am not guilty."

661
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,960
You don't judge yourself like that.

662
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,960
You have no business to condemn yourself.

663
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,080
God has created you with such difficulties, now understand that.

664
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,680
You are above everything that is (inaudible),

665
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,200
much above these things, much above all these flowers,

666
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,280
much all above the stars and all the sky that is created.

667
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,520
And here you are

668
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,840
like fools you are feeling guilty and sitting down at home?

669
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,280
And spoiling the work of God.

670
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,720
You have to get to your Realization.

671
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,280
You have to get to your absolute. You have to get to your own being.

672
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,040
And become what you are

673
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,680
and not to waste all the work that He has done here.

674
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,160
How He must be feeling.

675
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,360
How much He has done for you to become,

676
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,360
and here you are, on a small thing just slip out

677
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,640
and spoil the complete work.

678
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,480
Is this the way to behave towards your Father?

679
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,160
And towards your Mother?

680
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,480
And towards Christ, their Son?

681
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,680
Is this the way to treat?

682
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,880
We have to stand up with courage, with fearlessness.

683
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,480
This gives you fear, unnecessary botheration and worries.

684
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,520
And you start thinking about things, which do not exist.

685
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,720
All imaginary. Left Vishuddhi is a curse of modern times,

686
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,400
and I would request you all, to come out of it.

687
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,000
Every morning you tell yourself, that "I'm not guilty."

688
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,520
You must say it thrice in the morning and thrice in the evening.

689
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,000
What is there to feel guilty about?

690
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,720
I wish Christ had included at least in the prayer,

691
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,960
that you have to forgive yourself first of all.

692
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,520
I mean, He could never have imagined that humans,

693
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,320
human beings would be so stupid, as to all the time say

694
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,560
that, "I am guilty, I can't forgive myself."

695
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,600
Human beings have escapes for everything.

696
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,200
Now this is a new modern method they have devised

697
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,840
of running away from reality.

698
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,640
Reality is to be faced, and to be enjoyed.

699
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,720
It is called as 'Raj.' Is the one that has to permeate into joy.

700
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,960
You come and sit on the throne and enjoy.

701
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,360
Now I've been able to tell you in short about Vishuddhi Chakra.

702
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,280
Let's go to the another chakra here,

703
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,680
which is called as the Agnya Chakra.

704
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,320
Agnya Chakra resides in the center of optic chiasm.

705
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Optic chiasma is the one which crosses each other,

706
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,680
and in the center of it is the

707
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,160
special center called as Agnya Chakra.

708
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:59,240
Is a very subtle center, and this center is

709
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,800
adorned by our Lord Jesus Christ.

710
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,720
He is the Son of Mahalakshmi.

711
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,120
He's a Son of the entire power that resides here.

712
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,720
Is the Mahalakshmi, the Viratangana, the wife of Virata.

713
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,920
The power of the Primordial.

714
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,440
He is the Son created by Her

715
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,040
and is very well described in the Devi Purana and other books,

716
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,720
which are not yet translated, I think, in English.

717
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,960
As Mahavishnu, is called as Mahavishnu.

718
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,640
So the Vishnu's greater form, but He is the son of Vishnu.

719
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,120
He is the son of Shri Krishna.

720
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:52,880
Shri Krishna has described Him as somebody who is the Adhara,

721
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,000
is the support of the Holy Ghost.

722
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,120
He has given Him a higher position than Him, see.

723
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,920
And He said this one when He will be coming on this earth,

724
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,760
He will prove all that I have said.

725
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,360
He'll prove, because He will be the essence.

726
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,520
He will be the Omkara, He will be the all-pervading Power.

727
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,800
He'll walk on the water.

728
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,480
Not only, but He'll be resurrected. His body will be resurrected.

729
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,720
He has described Him fully there

730
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,520
and He has given Him the highest position,

731
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,680
that He is the Adhara.

732
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,160
He is the support, because He lives there at the Mooladhara also.

733
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,320
As the support of the root, and He resides -

734
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,800
actually He's the vice-chancellor of this university we can say,

735
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,160
that at every point, we have to have Him to certify.

736
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:52,960
If He is not there, you cannot, you cannot awaken the Kundalini.

737
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:58,480
If you don't believe in Him, you cannot retain your Realization.

738
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,680
Yesterday a lady asked Me,

739
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,520
"Can we not do it without Christ?" I said I'm sorry,

740
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,160
without Christ, because He's all pervading, He's the Omkara,

741
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,800
He's the one who is the Power,

742
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,680
He's the one who is flowing in us, He's the Spirit.

743
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,400
Now if you are seeking the Spirit, how can you do it without it?

744
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,200
It's an absurd question.

745
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,040
It is He came on this body, and this being a narrow path.

746
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,440
He had to pass through it to prove what Krishna has said -

747
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,960
that it cannot be killed - He got Himself crucified.

748
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,960
It was a drama, played by Him.

749
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,040
His Mother was the Holy Ghost, was a part that is the Mahalakshmi,

750
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,280
but He didn't say a word about it.

751
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,920
He didn't say,  because if He had said it,

752
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,520
people would have put their attention to Her

753
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,520
and He is bestowed with eleven powers of destruction.

754
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,160
He's such a powerful person.

755
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,600
You may show him as a lanky-panky fellow because

756
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,480
that satisfies your sadism.

757
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,520
You want to see Christ like that - He was not like that.

758
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,720
He was, He's only painted by I think Rubens very well,

759
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,880
but the best is that in the Sistine Chapel,

760
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:24,400
where Michelangelo has really, boldly painted Him the way He was.

761
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,840
He was a tall, not very tall, but quite tall

762
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,520
and a very healthy and a hefty person, with a big stomach.

763
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,840
He's known as 'lambodar,' with a big stomach.

764
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,360
And He could carry such a huge, big

765
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,920
cross on his back.

766
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,520
So people, when they showed Him,

767
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,680
I mean I was amazed that how could they show Christ

768
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,000
in such a miserable state, how could they do it?

769
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,720
I mean horrible it is.

770
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,480
This is just their own expression. That's how they wanted Him to be.

771
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,720
These are the people, who must have definitely crucified Christ.

772
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,520
Because they like to see Him so miserable and unhappy.

773
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,200
How can a person, who is a realized soul be that way.

774
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,720
He has to be a cheerful person, fiery, dynamic,

775
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,040
has to be a healthy person,

776
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,640
a miserable person, supposing before you stands and talks like this,

777
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,720
are you going to believe that person?

778
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,360
But this is the way they have treated Christ throughout.

779
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,520
They've maligned Him, and they've treated Him there

780
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,160
and has been crucified so many times.

781
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,240
I find it impossible to believe,

782
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,680
that how these people are reborn, who crucified Him again

783
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,720
and again and again they are crucifying.

784
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,840
The crucifixion is not the message of Christ.

785
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,120
That’s why I also don’t like people to wear the cross,

786
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,760
I can’t see the cross.

787
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,120
He’s God. Cross of course is very helpful,

788
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:57,200
because if the bad spirits see the cross they run away.

789
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,520
But it is a reminder of something, which was unbearable.

790
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,160
Because the Mother had all the power, She was Mahalakshmi.

791
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,320
He had eleven powers, eleven powers to destroy.

792
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,600
You can imagine, He has still those powers.

793
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,080
And He had to go through all that without destruction.

794
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,960
He saw to it.

795
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,200
Now, people may say, “How was He resurrected?”

796
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,240
First of all they have an objection to Immaculate Conception.

797
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,840
I mean they have objection for everything. He was not a human being.

798
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,800
He was the Divine Power.

799
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,880
I conceived you in My heart.

800
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,840
Do you know that?

801
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,800
And I put My Kundalini and I put you on My,

802
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,560
from My heart into it and I'll take you out from it.

803
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,160
The way you have got your second birth,

804
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,400
in the same way Christ got his immaculate birth

805
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:00,680
She put Him in the heart and into the uterus down below,

806
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,800
and She created Him.

807
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,080
It’s very easy to doubt Him and say things against Him,

808
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,760
because He is no more.

809
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,320
And the Jews must learn a lesson now.

810
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,440
They denied Him once and they have suffered.

811
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,120
Now, don’t deny Him again.

812
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:24,000
You cannot deny the person, the embodiment of this Divine Power.

813
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,720
Christians may be blown off. If Christians have tortured you,

814
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,880
forget them, they are just the same as you are -

815
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,520
fanatics, fanatics, fanatics.

816
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,600
Whether they are Christians or they are Muslims,

817
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,920
Khomeini is the same as any other person.

818
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,240
I do not find any difference whatsoever.

819
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,800
Dogmatic, ignorant, fanatic.

820
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,720
Forget these people, they do not stand for Christ.

821
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:51,040
Christ Himself has, in second chapter Matthews, second verse

822
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,960
“You’ll be calling Me, 'Christ, Christ,'

823
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,960
I won’t recognize you. Who are thee?”

824
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,960
The people who say, “Christ - we are the solicitors of Christ,

825
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,280
we are the people, who are in charge of Christ.”

826
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,040
All of these people will be charged.

827
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,240
And they will be thrown away in the hell,

828
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,760
the way they have managed things about Christ.

829
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,280
Some of them are genuine, they don’t know that this is artificial,

830
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,280
they are genuinely - but they must get their Realization.

831
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:27,800
They must ask for their real Realization,

832
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,440
and they must know what is Christ within themselves.

833
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,320
They have to awaken this Christ here.

834
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:40,800
Now, as I was telling you, that Christ

835
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,160
said that, “You are to be born again.”

836
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,400
That, “I’m to be born in your heart.”

837
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,240
Now, the heart center is here as well as here,

838
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,360
because the heart is controlled by this center

839
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,720
at the fontanel bone area.

840
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,880
And that’s what He said that, “You should get your Realization.”

841
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,600
When He said, “You should be put in the heart.”

842
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,520
Now, the people of various countries, even your country,

843
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,200
went down to India.

844
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,440
And they never told that Christ was born, who was the Mahavishnu.

845
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,720
Because He is already described in the Puranas.

846
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,360
That He is the Ādhāra. He is the One who will be, once awakened

847
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,360
in the Kundalini, by the Kundalini, will suck your karmas.

848
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,640
They never went and told,

849
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,160
so the Indians went on with their Karma Theory

850
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,200
and these gurus have come here to teach you karma.

851
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,120
It is amazing, how you accept all these theories of nonsense.

852
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,600
Like they say,

853
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,360
that, “You have to suffer, because you have done bad karmas.”

854
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,120
Then they may say that, “Yes, you can give you a balance,

855
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,400
but you go this way or that way and you just keep into balance."

856
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,560
If that is so,

857
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,880
that you have to go to one extreme and to another extreme,

858
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,960
then what are they doing here?

859
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,600
Why are they talking? They should shut up,

860
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,680
because they cannot do anything.

861
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,560
They cannot give you Realization.

862
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,600
They cannot save you from this situation.

863
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
So, it's better that you suffer.

864
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,880
But why do they say you should suffer?

865
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,120
Why should they say? Because they want to enjoy your suffering.

866
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,080
They want you to suffer, because they enjoy it.

867
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,160
So many of these disciples, who came from these horrible gurus,

868
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,480
who said, “You must have your karmas and you must suffer,”

869
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,160
told Me that they saw their gurus giggling at them

870
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,000
and mocking at them.

871
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,400
And they showed Me some of the photographs

872
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,880
they had taken of these gurus,

873
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:38,000
which shows complete mockery of these stupid disciples,

874
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,760
who were suffering in their body and suffering in their mind

875
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,560
in the presence of these gurus.

876
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,320
So they have a double enjoyment.

877
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,200
One the money, another is the sadism.

878
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,080
And third, the greatest of all, that their purpose is

879
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,160
to kill you all and to destroy you all, because you are God’s men.

880
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,800
That they achieve by their falsehood,

881
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,480
because you are impressed by their falsehood.

882
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,680
Now see, if there was any false guru here this hall would be filled,

883
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,320
the whole thing would be filled, on the road there would be a jam.

884
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,880
But the real Guru – I have seen not only here -

885
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,680
everywhere it starts very slowly.

886
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,720
Of course, in a place where people are very simple

887
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,560
and who are very sensitive, it’s a different point.

888
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,160
But the people in a city specially,

889
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:32,400
they are so insensitive to reality and so sensitive to devils,

890
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,160
that it is surprising, they feel very much at home with the devils,

891
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,680
and very much lost with the reality.

892
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,160
Because you are in falsehood.

893
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,680
So you must know that you have to become the real.

894
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,320
You have to become that which is the Spirit, which is not so far,

895
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,240
is shining in your

896
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,440
central nervous system, in your awareness.

897
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,200
And this is the Spirit, is the One, is Christ.

898
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,640
Now, I’ve spoken before also in the churches,

899
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:10,040
but today for the first time I am speaking about Christ in a church.

900
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,560
And that’s why I was very happy, that at least in this church

901
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,200
I would say something that could establish Him,

902
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,320
and that when people will come here,

903
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,520
I hope they get their Realization,

904
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,880
and that something works out here, they get at least the awakening,

905
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,400
because so many saints are sitting in front of Me,

906
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,400
maybe that one day will come in this church, maybe

907
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:34,640
it may work out, that people will get their Realization.

908
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,880
Christ’s life was only for three, four years.

909
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,640
Nobody allowed Him to live longer than that.

910
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:49,360
Whatever was possible was done, but such stupid people,

911
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,920
such stupid people, you could not talk to them.

912
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,800
And that’s how they killed Him.

913
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,080
He could not speak to them any more,

914
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,680
and that’s how His life was finished.

915
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,840
But in that small life of His – what a spark it was!

916
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,000
What a spark it was!

917
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:15,280
The way people have behaved towards Him is atrocious, I must say.

918
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:20,400
I must say the apostles themselves, because this Matthews and this -

919
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,160
he was such an intellectual. Such an intellectual.

920
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,000
He would not accept the idea of Immaculate Conception.

921
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,480
Very difficult man, he would argue it out,

922
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,000
he said, “If a virgin is going to give the child,

923
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,040
then everybody is going to say that

924
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,440
it’s a very, very blasphemous thing, it’s a very, very

925
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,200
illegitimate thing and it should not be spoken of."

926
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,880
Horrible fellow and one better than the other.

927
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:47,240
And when they took up about the spreading of Christianity,

928
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,080
they took it in such a funny way,

929
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,320
because they became supraconscious people.

930
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,360
They started speaking the languages of so many people.

931
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,080
That part of Bible is wrong.

932
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:02,000
Where they became not realized; the wind part is all right.

933
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,040
But so many people I’ve seen, who come to My program,

934
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,680
when they come for Realization,

935
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,760
they feel the wind for a while and immediately they shunt off

936
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,400
and become supraconscious.

937
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,760
Now, we’ll see what is supraconscious entry

938
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,320
and the subconscious entry.

939
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:22,400
Now you see here there are two spots.

940
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:28,920
These are the two petals, one controls of course the pituitary,

941
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,640
that controls the Ego,

942
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:36,880
and the pineal, that controls the Superego.

943
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,360
But this also has a capacity to blow this out this way,

944
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,040
and blow this out this way.

945
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,840
Supposing you become supraconscious,

946
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,600
or start, you start thinking too much

947
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,520
about something about the future, what must be the galaxy,

948
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,480
we should find out about it, and you must find out about the stars,

949
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,640
and about all these things and about future and about, say..

950
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,480
prophecies, what else is that is.. astrology

951
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,360
and all these, you see futuristic. You people are mostly futuristic.

952
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,560
You try to plan, and try to, and every plan fails, of course.

953
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,360
But this thinking of planning of too much

954
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,640
can push this up this side too much.

955
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,040
Actually as shown here is this side,

956
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,080
but actually when it is placed, it is placed like this.

957
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,000
The Ego is placed like this and the Super-Ego is like this.

958
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,720
Here we could not show the three dimensions.

959
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,680
So, from the back to this side is the Super-Ego,

960
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,360
and from here to here is the Ego.

961
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:45,000
Now, this Ego bloats out this way, into this side.

962
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,720
And when it bloats out this side,

963
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,120
it goes into the supraconscious area. So it comes up this side.

964
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:55,200
Now, the supraconscious area gives you visions, hallucinations,

965
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,200
LSD does that, LSD does that.

966
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,520
Then you start seeing some eye of a person,

967
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,040
who is a dead person, but a very ambitious person.

968
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:09,360
For example you might get the vision of Hitler.

969
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,680
You might get the vision of, say

970
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,920
all these horrible kings who ruled here.

971
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:21,680
You might get to see colors. You may see auras.

972
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,880
And one has to understand here that these auras starts coming to us,

973
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:32,480
because we shift, we disintegrate from our being.

974
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,320
That’s how we start seeing something else separated from us.

975
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,400
To see auras is not a good sign in Sahaja Yoga.

976
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,840
If you are seeing auras,

977
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,520
we have to bring you back to the same position,

978
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,920
because you have to be in the present and not in the future.

979
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:51,280
You get disintegrated. For example, if there is a machine,

980
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,040
say, which takes the auras.

981
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:00,240
I was talking to someone, who has done that work of aura-picturing.

982
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,680
Now, before – after Realization you don’t get any auras in a person.

983
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,720
Cannot get any auras in a person,

984
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,520
because it is integrated, completely integrated.

985
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,160
But when he is in a mess, you start getting the auras.

986
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,480
Like if he has cancer, you’ll get auras,

987
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,840
if he is an alcoholic, you’ll get auras.

988
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,520
That type of crazy auras.

989
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,200
A normal person may have auras not so much crazy.

990
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,240
But auras you cannot feel, when the whole thing is integrated.

991
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,400
You can see, in a – say, light.

992
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,040
If there is no aberration, that means it’s a good light.

993
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,840
If there is aberration, then it is a bad light.

994
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:45,800
All the seven colors of a light has to be concentrated

995
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,720
and has to be integrated.

996
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,200
If they are prismatic and if they are giving you separately,

997
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,160
then it is not one integration.

998
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,760
And when it is one integration, then you cannot see seven lights.

999
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,880
So the person is not integrated.

1000
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,800
Now, all these auras come to us,

1001
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,880
because we are made of seven type of cocoons within us.

1002
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,760
But the people who are on the right side

1003
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,400
only believe in the five cocoons. They call them Koshas.

1004
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,000
I don’t think if I have time for that,

1005
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,920
but these are the Koshas, are created by -

1006
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,440
one is created by the first center,

1007
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,280
by the second center, by the third center,

1008
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,480
this is as a physical growth, thing.

1009
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,200
By the fourth one, then the fifth one,

1010
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,560
and the sixth and the seventh

1011
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,800
are the things that they do not create auras outside,

1012
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,520
they create inside near the heart.

1013
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,720
And these are created near the heart,

1014
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,400
but as soon as you get your Realization, they all become one.

1015
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:54,000
They all merge into one and that is the Spirit.

1016
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:59,320
So, as if you can say when the Spirit exists in a prismatic state,

1017
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:04,680
then you get the auras of seven, but when it becomes integrated,

1018
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:10,560
that you become one, all the auras become one.

1019
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,320
So integration is the aim of Sahaja Yoga,

1020
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,240
and now, I think, I have told you,

1021
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,480
how you can also go to the subconscious area, the same way.

1022
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,360
The subconscious area is on the left-hand side.

1023
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,480
If you move into collective subconscious area, say for example,

1024
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,880
you can be triggered into cancer.

1025
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,280
By this triggering you might get heart attacks

1026
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,840
and things like that, diabetes.

1027
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,360
Now, many people believe sugar gives you diabetes, is not.

1028
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,080
Sugar doesn’t give you diabetes.

1029
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,280
What gives you diabetes is too much thinking.

1030
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,200
Those who do not think too much never get.

1031
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,000
Indian farmers never get diabetes; they don’t know what disease is.

1032
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,760
Because you think too much, you work too much,

1033
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,160
this center works too much.

1034
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,560
It has to create food for the brain,

1035
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:00,360
it has to replace the brain centers.

1036
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,680
And these brain centers are to be displaced,

1037
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,960
for that it creates out of fat

1038
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,920
the new centers, the evolved cells,

1039
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,560
that are sent here. And because of that work,

1040
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,320
if it is too much, it neglects the other things,

1041
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,280
which it has to work out throughout, one of them is the spleen,

1042
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,560
another is pancreas.

1043
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,720
And when it neglects the pancreas, you get diabetes.

1044
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,080
Not by sugar.

1045
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:32,320
Of course sugar, because it has to convert it into fat.

1046
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,040
But if you do not have sugar, then it’s a double work.

1047
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,120
If you have sugar, it converts it into fat

1048
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,760
and makes it useable for your brain.

1049
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,880
But if you think too much, then -

1050
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,120
and you don’t take sugar, it’s a double action.

1051
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:51,800
But if you just take sugar and do not think also can be problematic,

1052
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,360
because he has to convert too much of - into fat, you see.

1053
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,760
So, too much work is given, there is no balance.

1054
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:01,480
So, one has to understand, that too much sugar is not good,

1055
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,080
but you must take sugar,

1056
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,560
because the sugar is needed, and stop your thinking,

1057
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,160
how do you stop your thinking?

1058
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:12,560
Only by rising above the Agnya Chakra.

1059
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,080
This is a very, very important point at Agnya,

1060
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,360
that you must know, that the thinking stops.

1061
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:24,600
Now, the thinking comes to you like this, like a wave.

1062
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,920
It rises the thought and falls off,

1063
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,120
another thought rises and falls off.

1064
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,600
In between there is a place called as Vilamba.

1065
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:36,600
Now, when the thought rises, it automatically falls down,

1066
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,520
you can see the rising of the thought, but not falling off.

1067
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,800
Now, this space is the place of present.

1068
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,320
This rises either from the Ego or Superego and goes into the past.

1069
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,280
The in-between space is the present.

1070
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,280
One is the future, one is the past.

1071
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,080
Now, this space has to increase.

1072
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:03,600
When it increases, then what happens is that

1073
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,400
Agnya Chakra opens more – and you become thoughtlessly aware.

1074
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,080
You become thoughtlessly aware.

1075
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,160
You come in the present. There is no thought.

1076
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:18,200
And thought is the barrier between the creation and ourselves.

1077
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,960
For example you look at this

1078
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,720
say, a beautiful stone that is placed there, or anything.

1079
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,160
You watch it. Now, if you want to think,

1080
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,040
“Oh, it looks like a man, it looks like a devil

1081
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,880
or it looks like a God,” or whatever it is.

1082
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,240
There's a thought you are putting in.

1083
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,160
So, what you do when you are realized, you just watch, you watch.

1084
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:42,520
And whatever the joy is put there of the creator, of an artist,

1085
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,160
completely is within you, because there is no thought.

1086
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:50,560
There is no wave, there is no disturbance

1087
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:55,400
in a completely silent lake.

1088
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:00,080
All that is around it, all that creation

1089
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:04,080
comes into it, absolutely reflecting,

1090
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,840
and you enjoy it in thoughtless awareness,

1091
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,960
called as Nirvichara Samadhi.

1092
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:13,120
There is complete Nirvichara, where you have no thought,

1093
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:18,200
and you start enjoying that creation completely.

1094
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,360
The joy of that is there, nothing is lost.

1095
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,360
So, the thoughtless awareness comes in,

1096
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,640
when the Kundalini crosses this Agnya Chakra.

1097
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:33,280
It does double work. First it makes you thoughtlessly aware.

1098
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,000
Secondly, because the Kundalini, if it has pierced through,

1099
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,480
it pushes these and She fills these with the grace.

1100
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,400
The grace falls on these.

1101
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,400
When the grace comes in, you start relaxing,

1102
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,960
these centers also relax. These centers are in a tension.

1103
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,720
But when the grace comes in, they go back into normal.

1104
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,960
So, there is more, sort of expansion

1105
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,360
and the thoughtless awareness starts establishing itself

1106
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,120
at the Agnya Chakra.

1107
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,920
Now, the mantra of Agnya Chakra is the Lord’s Prayer.

1108
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,520
It has got two sides – Ham and Ksham.

1109
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,880
Ham means “I am,” and Ksham means “I forgive.”

1110
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:15,840
So, if supposing this is catching, you have to say, “I forgive.”

1111
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,720
If there is Ego within us, you should say, “I forgive.”

1112
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:25,320
If there is Superego within us you should say, “I am. I am.”

1113
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,960
So, it is Ham and Ksham, is the bija, is the seed.

1114
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,720
Is a seed of the prayer – Lord’s Prayer.

1115
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:33,720
Now, there are people

1116
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,920
who are talking the Lord’s Prayer is not all right.

1117
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,760
I mean, who are you, what do you know about it?

1118
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,160
Everybody is challenging every one.

1119
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,960
What do you know? What is your authority?

1120
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:46,400
The trouble is, everybody is entitled to do

1121
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,360
what they like with religion and with God.

1122
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,720
Though they do not know anything about it,

1123
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,200
they are absolutely ignorant, but they think they have a right.

1124
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,480
Because there is no political control over it.

1125
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,800
Even Hitler can talk about Christ, anybody can talk about Him.

1126
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,160
And about the prayer that He taught you.

1127
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,640
Who are you to challenge it? Who are you to challenge Him?

1128
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,280
I can’t understand, how do you challenge a person

1129
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:18,080
without knowing your own position in relation to Him?

1130
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,200
But this is a very, very common thing that people do

1131
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,560
and is due to Ego.

1132
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,920
Ego makes you high-handed.

1133
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,480
And this is the worst type of high-handedness,

1134
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,720
that you challenge God, you challenge Christ,

1135
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,320
you challenge everything, which you don’t understand.

1136
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:39,200
Your mind is limited. It’s a very limited vehicle.

1137
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,120
You cannot do anything with this mind of yours.

1138
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,480
You have to go beyond it.

1139
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,280
Somebody has to trigger you into the space.

1140
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,720
You have to go into there. You have to become the Spirit.

1141
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:53,640
Only by realizing your Spirit, you can get connected with God,

1142
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,440
which before that you are not connected.

1143
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,080
That’s why you have to become the Spirit.

1144
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,920
And the Spirit is the connection, is the link with God.

1145
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,960
There is no other way you can be linked with God.

1146
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,560
If you want to keep yourself in delusion, you go ahead with it.

1147
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,960
But this is the real thing I’m telling you,

1148
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,640
the true thing I’m telling you, for which you should know,

1149
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,360
you cannot pay, you cannot purchase it,

1150
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:26,160
you cannot demand it and you cannot work it out.

1151
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:30,520
The grace of God has to come, fall upon you to do it,

1152
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:35,360
or a person, who is enlightened can only enlighten you.

1153
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,800
Now, about Christ, if I have to speak,

1154
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,840
I’ve spoken once on Christ for seven days, one after another.

1155
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:48,480
There’s no end to it. He was such a great incarnation,

1156
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:54,320
that I just do not know how to say that...

1157
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,320
I’ve spoken all about it.

1158
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,800
As it is, we have many tapes in London, you can send for it.

1159
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,600
We are now going to have a center here,

1160
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,640
Herman has offered his place,

1161
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,160
and we will be sending those tapes there,

1162
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,200
at least 300 tapes we have got in London,

1163
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,200
which you can listen to, and see for yourself.

1164
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:19,240
And all of these tapes are very good because

1165
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,840
they are actually mantras.

1166
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,320
They work out the mantras and you also get listening to them,

1167
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:27,760
opening of your centers and all that.

1168
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:31,000
Now, the last, which is embarrassing,

1169
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,560
because he already has told you that,

1170
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:38,360
I’m supposed to have been here (inaudible).

1171
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:44,920
It is the integration.

1172
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,880
The end of it is the integration of all these seven centers.

1173
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:53,400
All these seven centers are placed around this area,

1174
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,520
called as the Limbic Area. This is the Limbic Area. Now, if you cut it,

1175
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,000
the brain, like this transverse section of the brain,

1176
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,960
you’ll find it, it’s like a lotus.

1177
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:07,960
You can find it, that there is a marking is like a lotus,

1178
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,800
opened out.

1179
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,520
And is, thousand petals as called, are like this.

1180
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,880
But the coloring is not all right, you people are so fond of

1181
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,280
these specific colors, so they have used it, but

1182
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,160
we can say that this kind of a thousand petal is there.

1183
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,640
Now it is said in the Bible that,

1184
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,400
“I will appear before you like tongues of flames."

1185
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,640
And these are, they appear, they all appear.

1186
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,360
But these are very large ones

1187
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:44,560
and they appear as living, living flames, in different colours,

1188
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,960
starting from one to another and they are thousand in number.

1189
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,840
Now, the doctors argue that, “There cannot be thousand,

1190
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,800
there have to be hundred and ninety-two.”

1191
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:58,080
I mean, just imagine these foolish people, to argue on that.

1192
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,480
But they do not know they are thousand in number,

1193
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,920
and they are placed here.

1194
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:06,880
But in the Limbic area, all the seven centers are surrounded.

1195
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:12,640
Like we have got now, you see, from here, this is the Agnya Chakra.

1196
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,920
Here. Behind it, here at the back,

1197
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,880
just exactly at the back is the Mooladhara.

1198
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,400
Surrounding it is this Swadhishthana.

1199
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,480
Surrounding the Mooladhara is the Swadhishthana.

1200
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,400
If you are catching on Swadhishthana,

1201
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,760
you can feel it within yourself, the heaviness here.

1202
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:35,760
If you are catching, say you have diabetes, give an example.

1203
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,640
Diabetic people get blind after some time.

1204
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,000
They lose the power of the eyes, because

1205
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,360
this thing oppresses the optic globe,

1206
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,880
which is controlled by the

1207
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,840
Mooladhara Chakra, we call it as Back Agnya.

1208
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:53,240
This portion at the back.

1209
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:58,280
So, this is the Swadhisthana Chakra here at the back.

1210
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,760
In the center here you find a bone, that’s the Mooladhara

1211
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,960
and around it is the Swadhisthana Chakra.

1212
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:10,960
Then here is the Vishuddhi Chakra, is the Virata.

1213
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,360
Is the Vishuddhi Chakra here.

1214
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,360
When you catch cold, you’ll find you’ll have a problem here.

1215
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:19,200
But if you apply something here, you’ll feel better.

1216
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,720
And this is the Vishuddhi Chakra,

1217
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:23,760
which is related to your throat, this one.

1218
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,880
Now, if you have problems with collectivity also,

1219
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:31,600
you might find a big block here.

1220
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:36,320
Now, at the back of it is the Nabhi here, at the back.

1221
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,080
This Nabhi has a left and a right side, as we have shown here,

1222
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,320
the left Nabhi and the right Nabhi,

1223
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,160
there are two, left and right Nabhi.

1224
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,600
I don’t know if I have told you about that, left, right nabhi,

1225
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,680
but, I mean, you can find out from the book,

1226
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,480
that there is left and right Nabhi.

1227
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,760
So, you have got a left and a right Nabhi.

1228
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,800
And also, you sometimes feel the Nabhi in here.

1229
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,320
Some people do feel, who have

1230
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,760
problems with their gurus and things like that, you see,

1231
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,360
then you feel it. But the whole Void is here.

1232
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,720
And this Void is called as Ekadesha Rudra.

1233
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:19,320
This Void. The whole of it. It goes like a ring round it. Around.

1234
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,800
And this ring is very important,

1235
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,720
because this you get it from the Void.

1236
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,680
If you go to a bad guru or someone you'll get this.

1237
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,720
And this is the one that is of the rider,

1238
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:34,720
the rider, the one, who has eleven powers of destruction,

1239
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,960
the one who is going to come, to slash out.

1240
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,120
Then He is not going to give you any counsel,

1241
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,720
He is not going to redeem you, no Realization.

1242
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,200
He’ll slash out those, who are not realized.

1243
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,280
And He will emancipate the one who are realized.

1244
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,880
That’s the last, that you don’t ask just now.

1245
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,040
We’ve some time more to save more people,

1246
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,280
because He is not going to question anyone,

1247
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:59,200
He is not going to allow you any more time,

1248
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,200
and that will be the time of complete destruction

1249
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,000
of all the satanic forces.

1250
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,160
So that is the Ekadesha here.

1251
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:11,040
That collects, because all these horrible gurus are here.

1252
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,680
These are the Ekadeshas.

1253
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,680
And this is one thing is to be understood,

1254
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,600
that one should get rid of this very easily.

1255
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,280
Now, these two children of Rama, who were born here,

1256
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,640
and they're endowed on the Sun and the Moon.

1257
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,320
The Sun and the Moon both are here.

1258
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,840
And the sun became, as I told you, Buddha ultimately here,

1259
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:41,640
and He became the - not ultimately- the Mahavira, there.

1260
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,400
But when they were on this earth, Buddha talked about non-violence,

1261
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:50,000
and people thought non-violence to chickens,

1262
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,960
to bugs.

1263
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,880
These Mahavira people, these Jains,

1264
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:00,120
we have a horrible community called Jains in India.

1265
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,680
And they believe in vegetarianism to this extent,

1266
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,160
that they get a Brahmin, pay him money,

1267
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:10,800
and put him in a hut and bring all the bugs of the village,

1268
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,640
put that those in the hut and the bugs live on that Brahmin.

1269
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,480
Is a fact, even today they do it.

1270
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,880
And then they pay some money to the Brahmin,

1271
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,160
because the bugs are fed.

1272
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,960
Now, you just tell Me this kind of a nonsensical vegetarianism.

1273
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,760
Am I going to give Realization to chickens?

1274
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,520
Just think of it. Or to the bugs or to the earthworms?

1275
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:36,200
You are human beings, you should eat a flesh,

1276
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:39,920
which is not of a bigger animal than yourself, because that’s horrid.

1277
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:44,200
But you can eat the flesh of the animals which are smaller than you.

1278
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,880
There’s no harm in eating that,

1279
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,360
and this kind of a nonsensical vegetarianism,

1280
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:52,400
“Don’t do any harm to the animals,” but they don’t mind doing these-

1281
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:58,200
Jains are the greatest, they are, you see, such… just like suckers.

1282
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,560
And they don’t mind killing people for their money.

1283
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,000
They don’t mind, going for what you call shikhar, in a... hunting.

1284
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:12,120
And killing anything, but they will not eat a chicken

1285
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,960
or even the garlic.

1286
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:19,120
Now, garlic, as you know, is very good for the heart.

1287
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,040
But they don’t eat garlic.

1288
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,480
It’s very good for the heart, it’s very good for people,

1289
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:27,800
who have got a tendency towards hardening of the arteries,

1290
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,680
where the circulation is a problem,

1291
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,080
is very good to eat that, and for cold.

1292
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,880
Those people who suffer from cold,

1293
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:38,000
if they regularly eat a fresh garlic, say, in the night,

1294
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,600
brush their teeth, they’ll be much better off.

1295
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,560
So, while talking about it I would say -

1296
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,640
Now, these seven centers are here.

1297
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:52,000
Now, at the fontanel bone is the center of the heart.

1298
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,920
Now, just imagine, it is at the center. So, where do I exist?

1299
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:01,720
I mean, all of them are seven centers, so I am just like a bubble.

1300
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:05,280
But if I am in your heart, I’m there.

1301
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:11,920
So, the key of Sahaja Yoga, that you have to recognize Me.

1302
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,280
If you cannot recognize Me, you cannot progress in Sahaja Yoga,

1303
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,920
I have to frankly admit it. Because he’s already exposed Me.

1304
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,520
I don’t tell this in My first lectures, but I have to say,

1305
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,640
that, please, now recognize Me.

1306
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,800
As your Mother I would request you to recognize Me.

1307
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,560
And you don’t have to give Me anything, just take things from Me.

1308
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,200
Just have it yourself. But recognize Me.

1309
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,320
If you deny Me, then this won’t open, this will be always troubled.

1310
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,720
That’s why at the end, when you say,

1311
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,640
“Mother, give me my Realization.”

1312
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,280
Because I have come on this earth to give you Realization.

1313
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:49,120
That's My job. It’s one of the worst jobs that one can have.

1314
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,000
Because it is so difficult with people, to talk to them,

1315
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:00,520
to tell them about it, and they are all the time up in arms,

1316
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,280
they are so aggressive and they start fighting.

1317
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,520
Is a Mother’s job, which is a thankless job,

1318
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,320
absolute thankless job. But I have to do it.

1319
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,320
And also only Mother can do it, because if you had Christ,

1320
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,120
He would have taken those eleven things and finished off everyone.

1321
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,000
If you had asked Krishna,

1322
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,160
He has also Samhara Shakti, he would have killed.

1323
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:22,440
But to use the whole thing with integrated idea and balancing,

1324
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,440
with understanding human beings, you have to have a Mother.

1325
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,000
And that’s why sometimes people try to become very familiar,

1326
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:33,200
and start taking advantage or

1327
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,320
taking liberties, which is a wrong thing.

1328
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:40,960
Whatever I am, I am and I’m Love,

1329
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:45,440
I can’t help it. I really can’t help it. I’m Compassion.

1330
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,720
One day I did feel very disgusted, really.

1331
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,960
Once I did feel very disgusted with people the way they were

1332
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:54,920
and I was just saying that, forget it!

1333
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:59,320
And then suddenly I saw My photograph and I saw My eyes,

1334
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,320
then I said, “Nirmala, You are Compassion,

1335
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,400
You are Compassion, You can’t help it. You just can’t help it.”

1336
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:06,920
I have to work it out.

1337
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:12,320
I know it means, it means sometimes too much,

1338
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,600
too much, but I have to work it out.

1339
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,400
Now, some people come out with a question, “Why You, Mother?”

1340
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:22,680
I said, “Why not you, is a good idea. Come along, and do it!”

1341
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,600
It will be the best for Me to retire, and

1342
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,960
my husband might give you a pension for it, he'll be so happy,

1343
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,320
that I’ve found out somebody who will replace Me.

1344
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,000
But I have not yet found out somebody, who will replace Me.

1345
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,440
I wish you could, would be a good idea.

1346
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,840
Now, the name Nirmala itself is, means immaculate.

1347
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,720
Means the one who is the cleansing power.

1348
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,440
Is a name of the Goddess also.

1349
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,200
My, actually sign name is Lalita, is the name

1350
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,280
of the Primordial Mother,

1351
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:55,960
that is the name of the Primordial Mother.

1352
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:00,600
But to be a human being with all these centers around, you working,

1353
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,320
for example for the last three days,

1354
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,360
you don’t know how much I am vibrating. You can ask

1355
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:08,040
Warren and other people, I asked them to take the vibrations

1356
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,320
and they were doing like this, where they couldn’t touch Me.

1357
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,720
They tried to put the hand on the head and they were just...

1358
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,640
They didn’t know how to touch Me, even it is so much vibrating.

1359
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:22,680
So, it’s not easy to carry this, all this load on this human body,

1360
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,880
appear like a human being, to act like a human being,

1361
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,880
to behave like a human being, so that there is a rapport.

1362
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:33,520
Why an incarnation is needed – there has to be a rapport,

1363
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,160
because the Unconscious cannot talk to you,

1364
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:40,320
whatever you see in the dream comes back to you afterwards

1365
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:44,960
from the subconscious area, all the ideas will be such a mess,

1366
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:49,760
such a confusion and you cannot decide anything.

1367
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:53,800
So, it has to come on this earth as a human being,

1368
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,480
and tell you, with a language.

1369
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:59,640
I never knew English all My life.

1370
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,400
First time I learnt English, but still I don’t know American English.

1371
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:09,680
I hope I’ll be able to learn something more when I travel around,

1372
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,000
and it’s a thing that –

1373
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,680
it’s God’s desire that you have to be realized.

1374
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,360
Is all written in the Bible,

1375
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,640
It’s all written in all the books of the scriptures.

1376
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:24,840
It is very largely written in the books of Adi Shankaracharya,

1377
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:28,800
who has described Me fully, in a very full way.

1378
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,280
And it’s easy for Indians to get to Me.

1379
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:37,080
I mean, though I have not much disciples in the cities,

1380
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:40,840
but they are aware of My Advent and they know that I am there.

1381
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,440
Most of them know about it.

1382
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:47,400
But they can’t understand why I have come to America.

1383
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:52,640
They say that, “Why do You come here? The people here won’t accept You.”

1384
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:57,080
But I don’t think so, because I think you are great seekers,

1385
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,240
very great seekers, born in this country. You are a special type,

1386
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,000
and I have to work for you.

1387
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:07,400
I must say the transformation that has taken place in the western

1388
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,880
Sahaja Yogis has not been achieved by Indians so much.

1389
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,720
Though they have an advantage, because they are born in a country,

1390
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:17,640
which has a basis, which keeps the attention intact.

1391
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,880
The attention is very much intact.

1392
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,040
So, it is easy to work it out there – here it is difficult,

1393
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,600
it doesn’t appeal to people, but still,

1394
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,880
you are all great people, so many of you are lost,

1395
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:33,080
but they can be all saved, but those who are here should know,

1396
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:37,120
that you have the greatest opportunity in your lives today

1397
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:41,240
to be realized and to give realization to others.

1398
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,480
First of all you have to become all right.

1399
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,560
Then you can give light to others.

1400
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:51,760
Now, the greatest thing that is needed for Sahaja Yoga is wisdom.

1401
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:57,040
And logically you will reach at a conclusion and understand,

1402
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:01,520
that Sahaja Yoga is the end of all the problems of the world.

1403
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,120
Of all the problems of the world.

1404
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:06,000
For example take the capitalism and communism.

1405
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:09,320
Now, I am a capitalist, because I have all the powers

1406
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,480
and I am the communist,

1407
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,880
because I cannot enjoy it without giving it to you.

1408
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,800
But it’s spontaneous. I have not to do it,

1409
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,760
because I think about it, it just works. It is like that.

1410
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:23,000
All the problems, political problems, economic problems,

1411
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,000
everything can be solved.

1412
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,040
Krishna has said, “Yoga Kshema Vahamyaham."

1413
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,520
"When you get your Yoga, you get your well-being."

1414
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:35,160
He has promised it. He could have said it, “Kshema Yoga Vahamyaham.”

1415
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,400
He did not, he said, “Yoga Kshema Vahamyaham.”

1416
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,760
First do yoga, first unite, unite with the Spirit,

1417
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,800
then you are blessed by all these things.

1418
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,800
This is the center of even material wealth,

1419
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,760
of Lakshmi, which works out.

1420
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:50,680
And all the Sahaja Yogis, who have been to Me, are blessed

1421
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,760
by material wealth also, but not too much like Mister Ford.

1422
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,200
That’s an extreme case, that’s a headache,

1423
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,560
but they get well-being from every angle

1424
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:03,200
in a balanced way and integrated way.

1425
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,600
So the last message is of integration,

1426
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,560
that you get completely integrated.

1427
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,400
Whatever you do, your heart supports it,

1428
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,560
your mind supports it, and your body supports it.

1429
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,880
You’re completely integrated in one being, that is your Spirit.

1430
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,200
May God bless you all.

1431
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:23,120
So now, this is the last lecture and I am going to Philadelphia,

1432
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:28,000
and you pray, that Philadelphia people get Realization more

1433
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,720
and we get more people into Sahaja Yoga

1434
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,960
and that they become enlightened.

1435
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:38,000
Then I’ll be going to Houston, then to Los Angeles

1436
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,800
and Vancouver for a day.

1437
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
If you have any friends or relatives there you can write to them,

1438
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,600
take the address, so that they contact

1439
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,840
and they come down to the program.

1440
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,040
May God bless you all.

1441
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,560
Normally I don’t tell about Myself,

1442
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,400
but today he exposed Me as soon as I came, I had to tell,

1443
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,080
because it’s not tactful.

1444
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,920
It’s not tactful to say anything.

1445
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:12,840
It’s better, that you discover Me, than I tell you, because

1446
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,000
Christ was crucified, everybody was tortured.

1447
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:20,040
I do not want to hamper My work, because it makes no difference

1448
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,080
by telling you anything before Realization. It’s better

1449
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,320
to tell you after Realization that I am the Holy Ghost.

1450
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:30,360
No doubt. I am the one about which Christ has talked.

1451
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:36,720
I had told them, I had never said this on, from a

1452
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,400
platform, and I told, then they had been telling Me,

1453
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,080
“Mother, You must say that once.”

1454
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,760
I said, “In America I’ll declare.”

1455
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:50,680
So, today I declare that I am the Holy Ghost, I am the Holy Spirit,

1456
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,760
who has incarnated on this earth for your Realization.

1457
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
May God bless you.

1458
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,360
Now, any questions?

1459
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:09,600
Sahaja Yogi: “Mother, I just like to say I love You.

1460
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:24,400
...and this is my important question: How can I still my thoughts?

1461
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,360
SY: How can I still them?

1462
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:45,240
You just say Lord’s Prayer. Now, before My photograph. Alright? Work out.

1463
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:51,160
Lord’s Prayer is the entry, is the entry, no doubt.
