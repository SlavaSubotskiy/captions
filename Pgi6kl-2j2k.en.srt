1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,000
Today I am going to address you
in English language,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,080
as desired by you.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,440
Even tomorrow perhaps we may
have to use this foreign language.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:24,560
Today’s subject is the relationship
between Kundalini and Kalki.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,680
The word kalki actually
is an abbreviation

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,920
of the word nishkalanka.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,440
Nishkalanka means the same
as My name is, which means nirmala —

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,080
that it is a spotlessly clean thing.

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,640
Something that is spotlessly clean
is nishkalanka,

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,120
without any spots on it.

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,440
Now, this incarnation
has been described in many Puranas:

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,120
He will be coming on this Earth
on a white horse,

13
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,120
in a village of Sambalpur,
they call it, Sambhalpur.

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,000
Is very interesting how people
take everything so literally.

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,320
The word sambhala means:
bhala is this forehead,

16
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,040
sambhala means “at that stage”.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,960
That means Kalki is situated
on your bhala.

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,520
Bhala is the forehead,

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,960
and here He is going to be born.

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,120
That is the real meaning
of the word Sambhalpur.

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:49,960
In between Jesus Christ
and His destroying incarnation

22
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,640
of Mahavishnu, called as Kalki,

23
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:05,000
there is a time given to human beings
to rectify themselves,

24
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,720
for them to enter
into the Kingdom of God.

25
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,640
Which in the Bible is called
as Last Judgement —

26
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,240
that you will be judged, all of you
will be judged on this Earth.

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,120
The population of the world
is the maximum, they say,

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,200
because all those, practically all those
who had aspirations

29
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,200
to enter into the Kingdom of God

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,800
are born in the modern times
and are going to be born very soon.

31
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,480
This is the most important time

32
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,600
because Sahaja Yoga
is the Last Judgement.

33
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,440
It is fantastic to hear this,
but that’s a fact and is the truth.

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,200
Though you can understand
that Mother’s love makes it very easy

35
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,240
for you to get to your Realisation

36
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,560
and that the whole story
of Last Judgement,

37
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,800
which looks such a horrifying
experience,

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
has been made very beautiful
and very tender and delicate

39
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,840
and doesn’t disturb you.

40
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,880
But this is the Last Judgement,
I tell you,

41
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,760
and you all are going to be judged
through Sahaja Yoga,

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,520
whether you can enter
into the Kingdom of God or not.

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,480
Now, in Sahaja Yoga
people come in

44
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,840
with different kinds of attentions,
or chitta.

45
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,560
There could be people who have
too much of tamasi krutya,

46
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,600
or what we call the inertia

47
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:52,560
or the more sort of sluggish
or slow-moving temperaments.

48
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,160
These, when they are exaggerated,
people take to spirits

49
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,400
or take to alcohols
or to some such things

50
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,880
which take you away from Reality
and make you numb within.

51
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,080
The other side is, as you know,

52
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,840
right-hand side people,
who have got too much ambitions.

53
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,840
They are extremely ambitious people;
they want to win the whole world,

54
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,960
and they want to become
something independent on their own,

55
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,840
malignant and cancerous.

56
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,360
They do not want to keep
their relationship with the whole.

57
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,520
You can see in this Kaliyuga
how people have gone to their extremes.

58
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,880
Some of them are very much indulging
into too much of alcoholism,

59
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,120
or you can call it something [like]
running away from your awareness,

60
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,960
from your Self, from truth,
the beauty.

61
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,960
The others are denying it.

62
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,720
They are denying everything
that is beautiful and are ego-oriented.

63
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,640
So we have people
who are superego-oriented:

64
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,760
very much conditioned, and lethargic,
and lazy, and absolutely primitive.

65
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,280
The other side is
that we have people

66
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,400
who are extremely ambitious,
dominating

67
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,600
and are destroying each other
by their ambition and competition.

68
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,520
These two types of people
of extreme nature

69
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,640
are rather difficult to enter
into Sahaja Yoga,

70
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,680
but the people who are in the centre
are easily absorbed in the Sahaja Yoga.

71
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,800
Moreover, people who are
less complicated,

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
simple-hearted, as they are
in the villages,

73
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,160
are very easily absorbed
by Sahaja Yoga,

74
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,880
and they take to it
without any difficulty.

75
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,160
Say, in the city you can see the result
of so much of work of Mine

76
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,240
that there are hardly about
two to three hundred people
today over here.

77
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
But if I go to a village,

78
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,360
the whole village, say, up to five
to six thousand people come round,

79
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,160
and all of them get their Realisation
without any difficulty.

80
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,280
Because here people are supposed
to be very busy,

81
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,720
they have so many
other preoccupations.

82
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,320
They think other things are much more
important than seeking God

83
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,320
and wasting your time
in such pursuits like seeking God.

84
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,240
Under such circumstances,
Sahaja Yoga takes its roots

85
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,560
very sweetly into the heart
of all the seekers.

86
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,040
It works very spontaneously.

87
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,080
You get your Realisation
without any difficulty,

88
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,320
without any effort,
without paying for it,

89
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,680
without going into any sort
of strenuous exercises.

90
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,880
But when we talk of Kalki,
we have to remember

91
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,600
that between getting our Realisation
and entering into the Kingdom of God,

92
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
we can falter very much.

93
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,200
This is called as yogabhrashta sthiti
(state of being fallen from yoga).

94
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,280
People take to yoga,
they come into yoga

95
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,880
and are then enchanted still
by their pravruttis (inclinations).

96
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,560
For example, an ego-oriented man
or a money-oriented man

97
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,680
or a man who wants to dominate

98
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,120
can form a group of people
whom he would dominate by his ideas

99
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,080
and can go in for a fall,
and the rest of them will also go down.

100
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,560
In Sahaja Yoga itself.

101
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,720
This has been happening
in Bombay very very often;

102
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,080
it’s a very very common thing
that has been going on.

103
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,320
But this is called
as yogabhrashtata,

104
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,440
where a person falls from his yoga,
he comes down on his yoga —

105
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,040
because Sahaja Yoga gives you
all the freedom,
whether to fall or to come up.

106
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,320
But if you go to any other guru,

107
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,040
doing any other sort of yoga
in which purification takes place

108
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,120
and where people are trained
and disciplined from very childhood,

109
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,440
in those yogas a guru
will somehow or other see

110
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,440
that you are injured
or you are hurt so badly

111
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,240
that you have no connections
with anybody else.

112
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,040
It’s like an operation: they take out
that personality and throw him away.

113
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,680
But here it is left to your freedom

114
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,120
to understand that you have to keep
to the mains,

115
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,120
you have to keep to the group,

116
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,480
you have to keep to the whole
and not to one person here and there

117
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,880
who is trying to overpower
the rest of you.

118
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,920
In Sahaja Yoga, anybody who tries
to come up too much comes down

119
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,360
because in nature, you have seen,
nothing grows out of bounds.

120
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,400
Like, human beings are
of a certain height,

121
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,160
the trees are of certain heights…

122
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,680
Everything is controlled.

123
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,600
You cannot try to show off
in Sahaja Yoga,

124
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,480
neither you should try to make
a different group

125
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,560
or a different type
of some special thing.

126
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,120
Specially I have seen in Sahaja Yoga
there are people

127
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,080
who come up and ask people
to touch their feet.

128
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,680
It is most surprising that invariably
such people get exposed in no time,

129
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,520
and one knows
that they are gone cases

130
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,600
because their chakras are caught,
they are badly caught.

131
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,960
Though they may not feel for a while,
their vibrations may be there,

132
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,920
but they go down and down and down
till they are completely finished.

133
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,080
Now, this yogabhrashta sthiti
is the worst thing
that can happen to anyone.

134
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,960
First of all, you don’t get
your yoga.

135
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,760
And if you get your yoga and then jump
to this sort of a condition…

136
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,080
about which Shri Krishna
has described

137
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,560
that you go into rakshasa yoni
(demon’s womb).

138
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,160
Those who come to Sahaja Yoga
must know

139
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,240
that you have to stick on
to one thing, properly,

140
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,640
otherwise what is the yoni left?

141
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,880
If you die without yoga,
maybe you are born again, maybe —

142
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,800
of course, this life is wasted —

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,840
but if you try such tricks
after coming to Sahaja Yoga

144
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,000
and try to impress on others
that you are a very great realised soul

145
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,280
or that you have achieved this
and achieved that —

146
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,560
all this nonsense that you have been
doing before getting to Realisation —

147
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,440
then there is a very serious offence

148
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,600
and you are punished for that.

149
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,520
This is the power of Kalki, which is
secretly working behind Sahaja Yoga.

150
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,960
For example, there was a lady
who came to see Me,

151
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,200
wanted to publish something
about Me,

152
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,360
and she was paid
by some horrible fellow.

153
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,240
And she published something nonsensical,
something that I never do.

154
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,160
So everybody was very annoyed and angry
and said, “Mother, You must punish her,

155
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,440
and we must take her to courts,
You must do defamation, this, that.”

156
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,360
I said, “I am not going to go to court,
you better go give up these ideas.”

157
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,240
But nobody would listen, you see.

158
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,320
It so happened that that paper
closed down for three and a half months,

159
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,080
and they had such a big setback.

160
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,960
Of course, this is not done by Me,
I would say,

161
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,600
as far as Mataji Nirmala Devi
is concerned, but is done by Kalki.

162
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,120
Kalki means
there are eleven powers

163
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,640
which are guarding
the beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

164
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,120
Anybody who tries to play around
with Sahaja Yoga is harmed very badly.

165
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,760
So today is a day of telling you
about the dangers

166
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,320
of playing with the Divine.

167
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,760
So far, people have been taking them
for granted.

168
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,360
They have tortured people like Christ,
they have tortured great saints.

169
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,520
All the time human beings
have been torturing.

170
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,120
And I have been warning
in every lecture practically

171
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,280
that don’t try that trick today,
because Kalki is already on!

172
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,120
And don’t try to trouble anybody who is
a saintly person, who is a good person!

173
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,680
Be careful about it
because Kalki is on!

174
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,720
And once this power comes on you,

175
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,160
you would not know
how to hide yourself!

176
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,400
Not only those
who are Sahaja yogis,

177
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,840
but this I am telling
to the whole world today,

178
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,720
that be careful!

179
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,120
Do not try to harm others!

180
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,520
Do not try to take advantage
of others!

181
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,200
And do not try to show off
your own power!

182
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,720
Because once this destruction
will start in your life,

183
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,520
you won’t know how to stop it!

184
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,200
Once, I went to… I think I have told you
before also this thing

185
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,320
that I went to Andhra Pradesh,
and there I told people

186
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:21,360
that “You should not grow any more
of this tambaku, tobacco.”

187
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,320
And they were very angry with Me
because they thought
this was their living.

188
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,040
They were minting money
and indulging in all kinds of things,

189
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,800
making too much money
and doing all kinds of papas (sins).

190
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I said, “In this world today
you have come

191
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,880
not for creating more papa
and more karmas on your head

192
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,680
but to do the cleansing of the papas —
the papaksh talana.

193
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,600
You have not come here to add
to your sins but to cleanse them.

194
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,520
This is the time of cleansing,

195
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,720
that’s why I am here as Nirmala,
to cleanse it.

196
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,000
While what are you doing
is to add to your papas.

197
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,000
What are you going to gain
out of growing this horrible tobacco?”

198
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,680
But they would not listen to Me;

199
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,720
and then, in three of My lectures —
it is on the tape, people are saying —

200
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,280
that I said that “Be careful!

201
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,280
The Kalki in the sea

202
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,320
will take respite on you!
It will come on you!”

203
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,680
And you know
what happened in Andhra.

204
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,840
Same with Morvi, I will tell you:

205
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,720
only last year some people
met Me from Morvi,

206
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,760
some very big people
from Morvi.

207
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,440
And they all believed
in a horrible “saint”,

208
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,120
who was a horrible fellow
and who has really destroyed

209
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,760
families after families.

210
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,560
I told them, “Why do you believe
in this man?

211
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,160
He is taking your attention
to materialistic things.
Why do you believe in him?”

212
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,920
Every house in Morvi had the picture
of this horrible “saint”.

213
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,640
And when I told them,
they would not listen to Me.

214
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,160
They thought that I was
just warning them

215
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,040
because I was sort of jealous
of that fellow.

216
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,760
And you know what has happened
about Morvi. Is a fact!

217
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,720
All these things have been said
in the presence of other people,

218
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,720
so that they have noted it down,
that what has happened,

219
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,600
in what place,
and how Mataji has said.

220
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,000
Before that, also in Delhi once I met
some of these people from Vrindavan,

221
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,200
and who were telling Me about
the pandas (priests) and this and that,

222
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,120
and I said, “All of you, give up your
professions, horrible people you are!

223
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,080
What business have you got
to make money in the name of God?”

224
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,960
And all those pandits and pandas
and all these people

225
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,680
are horrible parasites
on the society.

226
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
“You get out of your jobs,

227
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,120
or the river Ganges on which
you have been feeding yourself

228
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,400
will one day ruin you
completely!”

229
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,080
And when the floods in the river
Yamuna and the Ganges came in,

230
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,520
I was in London; I saw on the TV
all these pandas running away

231
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,520
with their khomchas (stalls)
and everything.

232
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,720
Of course, with these horrible people
when you associate,

233
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,640
when you live with them,
you also suffer; the innocent suffer.

234
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,520
Why should you be impressed
by such people?

235
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,560
That’s the thing
you have to pay for.

236
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,200
When you are impressed,
you are so compromising:

237
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,480
“After all, doesn’t matter,
we are going there,

238
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,960
so we must give something
to this fellow also,

239
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,320
he is a panda, of our forefathers,
sitting down there and begging money,

240
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,760
sitting before the river Ganges.”

241
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,560
Imagine, the Giver of Love
and the Giver of Joy is flowing there,

242
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,640
and these people are sitting
with their backs towards the river

243
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,640
and asking money from you!

244
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,760
What silly people they are;
such stupid, useless people!

245
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,240
And you pay them money,
and you think

246
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,040
that you have done a great punya
(good deed) by donating money to them!

247
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,320
This sort of life
we have been leading,

248
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,720
a compromising [one], not understanding
what is truth, what is not truth.

249
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,640
One side is a complete blind faith

250
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,880
into all this kind of thing
that is going on

251
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,120
in this country and all over the world,
but specially too much in this country.

252
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,160
We are simple innocent people,

253
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,200
with lot of bhavikta (sentimentality)
within us,

254
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,000
that’s true, but that doesn’t mean
we should be stupid and fools.

255
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,640
For example, the other day
at a meeting

256
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,200
in a place called Awargaon,

257
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,720
I said that these people
in the Vitthala’s mandir (temple),

258
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,120
called as badave (temple priests),

259
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,720
should be nicely punished for the way
they are ill-treating these saints

260
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,560
going down there on their feet
for days together,

261
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,440
and something
must be done to them.

262
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,600
And everybody was a little annoyed
when I said [this],

263
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,320
because for these poor people

264
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,760
these badavas —
who are rakshasas incarnate —

265
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,440
are something great.

266
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,400
They break the heads
of the people

267
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,840
who walk all the thousands
of miles there.

268
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,840
They break their heads
just like coconuts,

269
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,320
and all of them have pain
in the head.

270
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,880
Such cruelty they confer
on these innocent, simple people!

271
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,040
And do you think
I should support them

272
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,880
when I stand for truth
and for religion and for compassion?

273
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,000
When I said this, some people, you see,
who had some vested interest —

274
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,760
must be the relations of the badavas
or whatever it is — got angry with Me.

275
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,600
But thank God,
within three months time,

276
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,520
the whole thing had been taken over
by [the] Government.

277
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,880
It is so common with us

278
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,440
that we see with our open eyes
what is happening,

279
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,320
[yet] still we will be going on
doing the same thing in the temples.

280
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,160
Even in the name of God,
we are doing sins after sins.

281
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,080
We are adding sins to our sins,
and instead of clearing it out

282
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,680
and understanding it
through our developed brain,

283
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,720
we just go on adding [to] it.

284
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,280
This is what I call the people
who are tamasi (ignorant),

285
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,320
who do not use your brains;

286
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,920
they are mulabuddhis
(of rudimentary intellect).

287
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,560
They just follow somebody

288
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,720
because there’s some sort
of a hypnotic influence

289
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,800
or some sort of a charismatic
movement that is on.

290
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,640
In the West you can see
these charismatic people will take

291
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,720
thousands of rupees from them,
thousands of rupees!

292
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,840
And they will give them epilepsy,
gangrene;

293
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,800
if not that, madness, lunacy —
all sorts of things.

294
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,320
But people, like mad, are running
after all these movements

295
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,440
and are adding up
to their destruction,

296
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,680
to their pile of sins
that they have committed,

297
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,200
instead of spending some time
in cleansing their sins.

298
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,040
This time,

299
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,440
what we have got
is a most precious time,

300
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,280
and one has to be very careful
and alert about oneself.

301
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,400
One should not depend
on any other person for help in this

302
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,320
but should try
to completely consolidate

303
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,560
one’s own being
into the Kingdom of God

304
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,680
and occupy the highest seat
in the Heart of God Almighty.

305
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,640
Because when Kalki will come,

306
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,760
He will slaughter all these people
without any compassion!

307
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,920
He is devoid
of any compassion!

308
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,760
There are eleven Rudras in Him,

309
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,680
means there are
eleven destructive powers
absolutely powerfully settled in Him,

310
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,760
and when I see all that —
because I can see all that —

311
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,400
this emergency grows into Me
and I tell you: beware of it!

312
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,160
Don’t play fool with it!

313
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,240
Don’t take it easy
and do not compromise

314
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,160
with nonsensical people!

315
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,400
Stick on to the right!

316
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,320
Otherwise, the day is very near
when Kalki is going to come!

317
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,400
The other type of people are [those]
who think no end of their intelligence.

318
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,560
They have denied God.

319
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,920
They say, “Where is God?
There is no God.

320
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,560
We don’t believe in God.

321
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,560
Is all nonsense,
science is everything.”

322
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,440
What has science done so far?
Let’s see that.

323
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,400
What has science done for us?

324
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,200
Science has done nothing so far,
it has only done all dead work.

325
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,240
It has only made you
ego-oriented.

326
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,400
All the West is ego-oriented,

327
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,880
they are finding all the methods
of committing sins.

328
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,600
How to commit the worst sins,
they are finding methods,

329
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,040
and there are certain gurus in India
who are also supplying the knowledge

330
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,600
how to commit even worse
and worse and worse sins,

331
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,960
so they can easily go
with two running jumps to hell.

332
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,680
Whatever is wrong is wrong,
whether it is today, tomorrow,

333
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,800
or yesterday,
or thousands of years back.

334
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,680
Whatever is wrong for your dharma,
for your sustenance, is wrong!

335
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,920
The new phrase
is that “What’s wrong in this?

336
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,440
What’s wrong in that?”

337
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,480
That question will be answered
by Kalki only.

338
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,440
I am just telling you
that it is wrong,

339
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,760
and it is extremely wrong,

340
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,800
it is against your ascent,
it is against your being.

341
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,880
And then you will not have
any time to repent

342
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,120
and to ask this question,
“What’s wrong?”

343
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,560
You will be chopped off.

344
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,080
That is what
is the Kalki incarnation.

345
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,040
He is going to come
on a white horse, as they say.

346
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,320
It’s a tremendous thing
that is going to work out!

347
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,320
Every human being
is going to be sorted out,

348
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,680
and nobody can then claim!

349
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,440
See, everything is being advertised.
Everything is being published.

350
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,480
Even this instrument

351
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,080
that is created by science
we can use for spreading Sahaja Yoga.

352
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,080
You know that if I put it
on My chakras,

353
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,760
you get the vibrations
and you get your Realisation.

354
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,000
The whole science is subservient
to Sahaja Yoga!

355
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,160
Like, the other day
some TV people came

356
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,520
and they said, “Mother,
we want to have your TV done.”

357
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,560
I said, “You be careful
before doing it.

358
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,080
I don’t want any publicity.

359
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,200
But whatever you do,
do it properly.”

360
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,080
Through TV we can give
Sahaja Yoga.

361
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,160
Supposing I am there, on the TV screen;
I can ask people to put their hands,

362
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,160
and there can be thousands
who can get Realisation,

363
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,600
only seeing on the TV.

364
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,600
Is a fact that this is emitting
from My being, is a fact!

365
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,200
Why should you feel angry
about it?

366
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,080
Why don’t you come and test it?
Why should you be hurt?

367
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,280
Why your ego should hurt you
if I am like that?

368
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,200
If you are different,
it doesn’t hurt Me at all.

369
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,720
If you know one work
of, say, organising this or that,
I don’t feel bad.

370
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,480
Why should you feel bad
if somebody is a Divine personality?

371
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,880
Why did you feel bad
that Christ was a Divine personality?

372
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,520
Why did you murder Him?
Why did you kill Him?

373
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,000
Why did you torture all the people
who were such saintly people?

374
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,440
You were very wise
and sweet, isn’t it?

375
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,120
You have been very kind
and nice people,

376
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,960
running after all kinds of wrong type
of useless, misguiding people.

377
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,520
There are so many now
who have come to misguide you.

378
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,040
They are taking money from you
for misguiding you.

379
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,600
They are taking money
for giving you sins.

380
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,800
They are nicely booking you up
for a trip to hell,

381
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,400
they themselves are booked
nicely there.

382
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,080
And when I say about them,
people feel very hurt

383
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,400
that “Why should Mataji talk
against these gurus?”

384
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,400
They are not gurus,
they are rakshasas!

385
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,000
Once, Christ stood up and said,

386
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,720
“These devils and the children of devil
will have to go to hell!”

387
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,720
Then people got after Him;
they said, “Why do you say
such things against them?

388
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,760
They don’t say anything
against each other.”

389
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,960
Christ said, “The Satan is not going
to speak against his own house.”

390
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,160
They are very friendly
with each other.

391
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,760
There is no problem among them.
They are very kind to each other.

392
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,280
Now all the disciples
are being distributed:

393
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,800
“You take such a lot, I take such a lot;
and all of us will go to hell directly!”

394
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,640
It’s properly organised!

395
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,760
Like, one train is going first,
then the second train will leave,

396
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,960
then the third train will leave.

397
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,120
The other side of this kind
of ambitiousness

398
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,000
and the kind of ego-orientation
and money-orientation we have:

399
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,840
all the time we are busy
with this money!

400
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,240
I call it a bhrama,
call it a hallucination.

401
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,840
It’s a big hallucination with you people
that you are running after money.

402
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:48,000
It’s another hallucination
that you are running after pretatmas
(dead spirits) and dead bodies.

403
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,480
These are two mirages
you are running after.

404
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,080
What are you going to get
out of this money?

405
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:00,880
Go and see somebody who is
supposed to be a very very rich man.

406
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,800
Just go and see:
Is he a happy man?

407
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,360
What is the analysis
of his life?

408
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,400
So-called successful people,
you just go and see them,

409
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,200
what is the success they have?

410
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,080
Who respects them?
When they turn their back, people say,

411
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,720
“Oh God, whose face have I seen!
Let me go and wash my mouth!”

412
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Are you auspicious?

413
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,560
If somebody sees you,
does any good comes out of you,

414
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,560
some shubha (happiness) happens
to that person?

415
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,520
Are you kalyanamay (virtuous)?

416
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,440
Are you mangalmay (auspicious)?

417
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,200
What sort of a personality
are you?

418
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Just judge yourself; and that judgement
can take place here in Sahaja Yoga.

419
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,840
We had a patient
who came to Sahaja Yoga,

420
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,280
and he told Me,
“Mother, I’m a young boy,

421
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,000
but I don’t know what has happened to me
that I have become inauspicious.”

422
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,360
I said, “How do you know?”
He said, “Wherever I go

423
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
there’s a quarrel
between husband and wife;

424
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,360
something goes wrong
with the children;

425
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,400
the children start crying
and shouting and screaming.

426
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,840
And now I’m hated by everyone;
everybody says, ‘There’s something
wrong with you.’”

427
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,640
I found out about him
what was the matter.

428
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,680
He got cured.

429
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,280
Now he is emitting
beautiful vibrations.

430
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,400
You can have very negative vibrations
going out of you.

431
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,280
You might be doing sins
without your knowledge,

432
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,200
and you would say, “Oh, Mother,
I’m getting all the vibrations,
I’m very good.”

433
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,200
Such people always deceive themselves
and others. Very good at it.

434
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,880
“Oh, nothing wrong with me,
I am in first class condition,

435
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,520
my vibrations are the best!”
and that “I’m doing very well!”

436
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,800
Who is going to judge you
is your deed.

437
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,600
What good have you done
to others?

438
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,720
Recently we had a mishap
like that.

439
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,040
And I found all those people
who were touched by that gentleman

440
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,960
had Left Swadhishthana catching,
very badly.

441
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,440
And when I told them
that this was a wrong thing to do,

442
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,840
is to make this man so important,
they all got after My life.

443
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,840
There was a doctor who had come
to see Me, who is a Sahaja yogi.

444
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,560
His son came to see Me;
he’s eight years old and a very good boy,

445
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,320
had a Realisation,
but he had a very bad Swadhishthana.

446
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,680
So I asked him, “Does this man
come to your house?”

447
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,520
He says, “Yes, Mother,
he comes very often.”

448
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,560
Despite My warning he would go
to their house and they would entertain
that gentleman.

449
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,800
Instead of telling him
that “You go to Mother
and get yourself cleared out!”

450
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,920
You see, they are enticed
and hypnotised by such a person.

451
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,280
I asked him, I said, “Have you got
this man coming to your house?”

452
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
“Yes,” he said.

453
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,360
I said, “All right,
go and beat him with shoes,
as we do in our Sahaja Yoga.”

454
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,480
And the boy got cleared out.

455
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,560
Do you want to ruin your family,
your children, everybody

456
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,760
because you’re adhering
to some hypnotic fellow?

457
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,640
At least have
some consideration for them!

458
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,480
There are many like this.
But in Sahaja Yoga
it is very easy to desert,

459
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,760
and even in London I know
who is going where,
what they are doing.

460
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,480
I write to them, I tell them,
“Don’t do it! Just don’t do it,
have nothing to do!”

461
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,160
Immediately you must understand
that our Mother,
who knows these things…

462
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,480
She knows,
and if She has told us,

463
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,200
it is the thing that is to be done;
not to be argued.

464
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,960
Did you get your vibrations
through arguments?

465
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,080
But still in Sahaja Yoga also
people falter,

466
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,320
and that’s the worst thing
they will do

467
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,040
because yogabhrashtas
are the most condemned.

468
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,240
Where will they go?

469
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,160
I have to warn all the Sahaja yogis
who are here,

470
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,160
because Sahaja Yoga
is the Last Judgement.

471
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,120
Not only that you will be judged

472
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,920
that you are entering
into the Kingdom of God,

473
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,640
that you become
the citizens of God, is correct,

474
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,560
but apart from that,
that you are capable of being there;

475
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,200
whether you have
the complete surrendering

476
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,640
and understanding
of divine laws.

477
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,480
Even if you are belonging to, say, India
and [are] a citizen of India,

478
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,200
but if you do mistakes
and if you commit criminal laws,

479
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
you will be punished,
even then.

480
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,000
So, even if you become
the citizen of God,

481
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,960
you have to be very very careful
about it.

482
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,200
The second thing
I would like to tell you

483
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,000
is about the destroying powers
of Kalki.

484
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,640
Today’s lecture is going to be
very sharp for you

485
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,680
because the incarnation
that you have asked Me to speak on

486
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,160
is a very sharp one,
is the sharpest of all.

487
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,840
We had, say,
Krishna’s incarnation,

488
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,880
when He had hanana shakti
(killing power).

489
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,600
He has killed Kamsa (His evil uncle),
He has killed so many rakshasas;

490
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:43,320
you know [that], as child also,
He has killed Putana…
and so many people.

491
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,520
But He had leela
(playfulness) also.

492
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,240
He had love,

493
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,440
and He did give concessions to people,
He forgave people also.

494
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,960
But Christ, who is the embodiment
of forgiveness —

495
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:08,200
forgiveness of Christ
is nothing but is the power
of sustenance within Him —

496
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,480
if He explodes,

497
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,560
the whole forgiveness
can come on us as a big disaster

498
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,120
if we are not able to understand
the value of His forgiveness.

499
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,880
He has said very clearly

500
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,320
that “Anything said against me
will be tolerated,

501
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,360
but a word against Holy Ghost
won’t be tolerated!”

502
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,640
He has clearly said it!

503
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,040
And now you have to understand
that Holy Ghost is Adi Shakti.

504
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,800
One has to understand
that such an incarnation is imminent.

505
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And Krishna’s powers are given to Him,
which are only hanana shakti.

506
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,200
Brahmadeva’s powers,
which are only hanana shakti,
are given to Him.

507
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,840
Shiva’s powers,
which are just hanana shakti,

508
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,520
the part of it which is a Tandava
(dance of annihilation) is given to Him.

509
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,320
Then, Bhairava’s shakti,
which is also…

510
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,800
you know what Bhairava has got
as a symbol of killing,

511
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,720
is a big sword-like thing.

512
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,280
And also Ganesha’s parasha (battle-axe);

513
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,360
and also Hanumana’s all navasiddhis
(nine supernatural abilities),
which are going to destroy,

514
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,560
are given to Him.

515
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,080
All Buddha’s forgiveness

516
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,320
and Mahavira’s ahimsa (non-violence)
is going to turn upside down.

517
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:37,160
All these eleven powers
are going to come on top of us

518
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,360
when we will be finished
with Sahaja Yoga,

519
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,400
when we will be
absolutely sorted out;

520
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,360
and the last killing
will be done by Him.

521
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,920
I wish it was just a killing!

522
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,000
It is not going to be ordinary hanana
like even Devi has done.

523
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,560
Because Devi has killed
all these rakshasas
thousands of years back,

524
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,880
but they are back in the seat again,
all these rakshasas.

525
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,320
Now, the problem is very different
at the present moment,

526
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,200
which you should try
to understand.

527
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,520
That, in the olden days,
till the Krishna’s time,

528
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,240
when He says that “Yada yada
hi dharmasya glanirbhawati bharata

529
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,120
… vinashaya cha dushkrutam
paritranaya cha sadhunam” —

530
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:28,320
these two words you must understand:
to destroy the dushkrutam,

531
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:33,280
means the cruel people
or the negative forces,

532
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,760
and to save the saints —

533
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,760
“sambhavami yuge yuge,
I am going to come again and again.”

534
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,360
But the problem
of the Kaliyuga is

535
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,120
that there is no pure and simple person
as a sadhu (virtuous person, saint)

536
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,840
or as a rakshasa.

537
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,560
So many rakshasas
have entered into your brains.

538
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,200
You side with so many people
who are wrong,

539
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
who are doing wrong,

540
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,720
who are doing all kinds of wrong things
in the name of politics,

541
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,080
in the name of religion,

542
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,480
in the name of progress
and education and all that.

543
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,800
Once you have sided with them,
then they are in your brain,

544
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,080
they are within you.

545
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,360
And when they are within you,

546
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,000
how to destroy the dushkrutams?
They are within you!

547
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,800
You may be a good person,
but you may be destroyed

548
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,560
because of having them
in your heads.

549
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,120
So there is no
hard and fast rule

550
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,960
as to say who is a real negative
and who is a real positive.

551
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,120
Only the Sahaja Yoga
is going to cleanse you

552
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,600
and make you
absolutely positive,

553
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,400
positively good people
and religious people.

554
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,160
This is the only way
because your ankura (sprout),

555
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,040
when it starts
giving you Realisation,

556
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,840
you feel your Self;

557
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,040
you feel your Self,
and with that Self

558
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,600
you know that you are your Self
and not this mirage.

559
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,360
You start enjoying that Self.

560
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,120
Once you start enjoying it,
you give up all these things

561
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,960
that make you compromise and make you
a horribly mixed-up person.

562
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,800
All this confusion
can go away.

563
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,560
So it is essential

564
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,720
that we should take to Sahaja Yoga
in the most dedicated manner

565
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,360
and redeem ourselves
of our all wrong doings,

566
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,440
and also others whom we know;

567
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,760
and this is the only thing
that we can give to our friends,

568
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,080
relations, and all the world
around you.

569
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,400
People invite others for dinners,
have drinks, this, that.

570
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,320
What do you give them?

571
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,520
Nothing.

572
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,640
They will give presents on a birthday,
they’ll go round and give garlands

573
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,280
and exchange good wishes
and everything…

574
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,720
In London,
when there’s a Christmas day,

575
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,520
the cards pile up
to such an extent

576
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,160
that no letter can be sent
for ten days before Christmas.

577
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,640
And where is Christ?

578
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,040
On the day when Christ is born,
they’ll go in for a champagne.

579
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,640
Such foolish people!
Even somebody dies,
they’ll go for a champagne.

580
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,880
Champagne is their religion now,

581
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,240
and whisky is their Kundalini.

582
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,040
They cannot understand God.

583
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,400
How can they
when they have made God

584
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,000
according to their own conception
of falsehood?

585
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,360
As a Mother,
I have to warn you: be careful.

586
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,960
Do not play about
with your Self.

587
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,600
Do not go down but come up,
come up, and come up.

588
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,440
I am here to help you.

589
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,080
I am here to work for you
day and night;

590
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,880
that you know
I work very hard for you.

591
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,120
I’ll spare no efforts

592
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,760
to help you and do everything
that is possible
to make you all right,

593
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,600
to pass this examination
of Last Judgement.

594
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,600
But you have to cooperate
with Me,

595
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,600
and you have to go
headlong about it

596
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,640
and devote most of your time
for Sahaja Yoga

597
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:06,280
and for imbibing all
that is great and noble.

598
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,760
Kalki is a very big subject,

599
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,360
and if you see the Kalki Purana,
it’s such a big book.

600
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,880
Of course, a lot of trash
is also in there.

601
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,360
But “When is the time coming?”
if people say,

602
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,520
we’ll say
this is a living process.

603
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,440
When the work
will be finished,

604
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,560
when we will see
that there’s no more chance

605
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,920
of having any more people
in this line,

606
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,000
Kalki will come down.

607
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,120
Let us see
how many come in.

608
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,680
But there is a limit, also,
of that.

609
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,520
So, I would request you
to go out:

610
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,280
call your friends, call your relations,
call your neighbours, all of them.

611
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,160
Tomorrow is the last day
of My programme here of Navaratri,

612
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:53,360
where we are going to have
a little felicitation from the Mother.

613
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,960
To Me, the greatest
felicitations will be

614
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,560
when in this Bombay
I will find more people realised,

615
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
taking to Sahaja Yoga
seriously.

616
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,520
And after coming to Sahaja Yoga,
not to indulge in backbiting

617
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,760
and small petty-mindedness
and getting angry with each other

618
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,480
but being sensible and wise.

619
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,480
It is most surprising:
those who are supposed to be
the cream of the nation,

620
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,600
the most sophisticated people,
are so petty-minded and useless!

621
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,560
I have to tell you these things
because of the immediate emergency

622
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,120
that is coming forward
before Me.

623
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:41,320
And I am only praying
that it should not be in Bombay
that it should start.

624
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,280
Bombay had gone into the verge,
if you remember,

625
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,040
the day when Rajesh Shah
phoned Me

626
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,440
that “Mother, what about rain?
What about rain? What about rain?”

627
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,120
I wouldn’t answer him,

628
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,320
till he said, “Mother, I know
You are angry with Bombay people,

629
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,920
but still forgive them,
once again!”

630
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,480
And that is the night
when you started getting all this rain.

631
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,040
Next calamity, beware of it!

632
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,520
I have to tell all Bombay people:
every time I come back,

633
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,200
I find this kind of a nonsense
of these Sahaja yogis

634
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,800
getting after one man somewhere
and getting lost.

635
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,960
And the another thing is
that Bombay people
are still most unaware

636
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,240
of what is going to fall
into them.

637
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,720
Most unaware how they are made
from amoeba to this stage,

638
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,320
what God has done for them,
and what they have to do for God.

639
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,480
It’s a very very sad affair.

640
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,360
Extremely sad
for the whole of the country

641
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,200
because people try to follow
this Bombay.

642
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,480
There are so many people
who would like to follow
an actor and an actress

643
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,120
than to follow God.

644
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,120
This is the trouble
with our superficial temperaments.

645
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,040
I have to say that we have tomorrow
a very good programme.

646
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,640
And also,
a book has been written,

647
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,520
“The Advent”
by Grégoire de Kalbermatten,

648
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:13,040
who is a son of a baron
and a Swiss boy.

649
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,280
And when he came to Me,
I could see clearly that he is a seeker,

650
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,720
though he was a gone case,
he was like a schizophrenic person.

651
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,280
He was absolutely a gone case.
But I could see in him
that there’s a big seeker within him,

652
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,320
and I had to work hard with him
for a year

653
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,200
to bring him round
to his normal senses.

654
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,840
But when there is not even seeking
within you

655
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,320
and when you go that astray,

656
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,160
what is going to happen to you,
I don’t know.

657
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,360
So be careful,
be very very careful.

658
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,360
Today is the day
of warning you,

659
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,320
because you have asked Me
to talk about Kalki.

660
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,480
He is placed on our forehead.

661
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:56,200
When the Kalki is caught up —
the chakra of Kalki is caught up —

662
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,160
the whole of murdha (head),
on top, goes out of order.

663
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,840
In the Kundalini awakening,

664
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,920
we find that the murdha
is all out of order; it doesn’t rise.

665
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,120
The whole head
becomes a blockade.

666
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,960
Such people do not allow
the Kundalini to rise

667
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,360
above the… we can say,
the Hamsa Chakra.

668
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,200
At the most, they might try
to raise up to Agnya,

669
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,680
but the Kundalini falls down.

670
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,400
Of course, one of the reasons,
as I said,

671
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,800
[is] that if you put your forehead
before wrong gurus also, you suffer.

672
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,600
But too much thinking also creates
a problem on the right-hand side here,

673
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,040
and one of the aspects
of Kalki gets spoilt,

674
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,560
and there is an imbalance
is created on this side.

675
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,120
The whole forehead,
if it is full of lots of bumps,

676
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,520
then one must know
that the Kalki Chakra is out of order.

677
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,840
If the Kalki Chakra
is out of order,

678
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,640
the person is about to go
into some sort of a very bad calamity;

679
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,080
is a sign of a person
who is going to get it.

680
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,480
When the Kalki Chakra is caught up,
all your fingers start burning.

681
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,760
On the hands and on the palm,
sometimes even in the body,

682
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,600
you get terrible burning.

683
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,280
A person’s Kalki Chakra catching
means he might be down

684
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,400
with a horrible disease
like cancer, maybe leprosy,

685
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,080
maybe any such diseases,

686
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,640
or maybe that he is about to collapse
into some sort of a calamity.

687
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,320
So Kalki Chakra must be kept
all right in balance.

688
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,720
At least there are eleven sub-chakras
of the Kalki Chakra.

689
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,960
And out of them, at least try
to keep some of them alive

690
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,680
so that others can be rescued.

691
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,800
But if all the chakras
are ruined,

692
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,440
then it is very difficult
to give you Realisation.

693
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,200
What is the thing one should do
to keep your Kalki all right?

694
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,280
To keep your Kalki all right,
you must have that awe for God.

695
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,880
If you do not have awe for God,

696
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,160
if you are not afraid of God,

697
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:07,120
if you are not afraid
that if you do wrong
He is there with His wrath

698
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,480
and that He is a wrathful God

699
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,080
and that He is full
of poison for us;

700
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,440
if we try to do anything wrong,
if there is no fear of that —

701
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,440
not that it is to be hidden from Me
or from anybody else

702
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,920
but not… you yourself know
that you are doing wrong —

703
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,520
if you are doing
something wrong

704
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,320
and you know in your hearts of hearts
that “I am doing something wrong,”

705
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,680
please don’t do it!

706
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,760
Otherwise your Kalki
will go out.

707
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,680
When you have
that awe for God

708
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:41,080
and you know that God is All-pervading,
He is All-powerful,

709
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,800
He has powers to raise us
to this state of higher being,

710
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,080
and also He has power to bestow
all the blessings that He has,

711
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,120
He is the most compassionate God,

712
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,160
or, we can say,
the most compassionate Father
that one can think of —

713
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,760
but in the same way
He has a wrath.

714
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,120
And that wrath, when it falls upon you,
be very very careful!

715
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,880
As a Mother,
I have to warn you:

716
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,720
be careful about the wrath
of your Father!

717
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,720
Because if He comes on you
with that wrath, nobody can stop it!

718
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,440
Nobody can stop it,

719
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,840
and the compassion of Mother
also will not be listened to,

720
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,360
because He may say
that “You have spoiled your children
by giving them too much looseness!”

721
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,800
So I have to tell you that please
don’t do anything that is wrong

722
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,480
and do not make Me
feel bad about it.

723
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,800
Because, for a Mother,
it is very difficult to tell these things.

724
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,520
It’s very hard, for a Mother,

725
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,400
who has a tender heart
and a kind heart for you,
to say all these things.

726
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,760
But I have to request you
that don’t play about,

727
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,360
because your Father
is full of wrath

728
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,240
and He can punish you
if you do anything wrong.

729
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,080
But if you do anything for Him

730
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,960
or for your own being,
for your Self-Realisation,

731
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,640
you will be placed
in the highest position.

732
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,720
Today you may be
the biggest millionaire,

733
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,720
you may be the richest man,
you may be the greatest political leader,

734
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,720
you may be the prime minister,
and all that nonsense —

735
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,400
in the presence of God,
those who are dear to God

736
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,760
will be placed
at the highest positions,

737
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,960
and not all these worldly things
which look so interesting
and enchanting to you.

738
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,800
The most important thing — where are you
as far as God is concerned.

739
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,080
That relation
you must establish

740
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,240
by first finding out your Self,
your Atma through Sahaja Yoga

741
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,440
and then relating
yourself to that.

742
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,120
May God bless you all!

743
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,320
Now we’ll have a session of Sahaja Yoga
for you to get corrected,

744
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,520
and I would like those people
who have not been here before

745
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,080
to come forward,
to get their Realisation,

746
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,240
and all the Sahaja yogis
to help Me today

747
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,280
because, today being Kalki’s day,
the vibrations have been a bit too much.
