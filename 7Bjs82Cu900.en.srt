1
00:00:00,468 --> 00:00:07,988
Today we are here to celebrate the resurrection
of Christ.

2
00:00:07,988 --> 00:00:14,788
Resurrection of Christ has the greatest significance
for all the Sahaj Yogis.

3
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:23,238
And we have to understand that He resurrected
Himself so that we could resurrect ourselves.

4
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:29,238
The message of His life is His resurrection
and not His cross.

5
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:35,148
He bore the cross for us and we don’t have
to bear anymore.

6
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:42,989
I see lots of people having this drama going
on: they are carrying the cross across to

7
00:00:43,014 --> 00:00:46,194
show as if we are going to do the job for
Christ!

8
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:52,254
As if He has left some work to be done by
these people who play a drama.

9
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:56,254
But all this drama is to deceive yourself
and to deceive others.

10
00:00:56,254 --> 00:01:06,333
There’s no sense in playing such useless
things to show how Christ suffered.

11
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:10,784
To make you weep and to make you cry, Christ
did not suffer.

12
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:16,704
He suffered that you should enjoy, that you
should be happy, that you should lead a life

13
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:23,993
of complete bliss and gratitude to the Almighty
who has created you.

14
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:27,004
He would never like you to be unhappy.

15
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:31,693
Which father would like his son to be unhappy?

16
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:40,074
So we have to understand that His message
of His life, why He came on this Earth to

17
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:44,314
do the greatest job is that of resurrection.

18
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:49,633
If He had not resurrected Himself, I could
not have worked out Sahaj Yoga.

19
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:56,353
So we have to be eternally thankful to His
life and to Him, the way He did all these

20
00:01:56,353 --> 00:01:59,964
difficult tasks, taking upon Himself.

21
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:03,784
That, we cannot do, we human beings, cannot
do it.

22
00:02:03,784 --> 00:02:11,794
It’s only He being the Divine, He being
the Om, He being the Logos, He being the Brahma

23
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:15,284
could do it.

24
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:18,434
But now you all have ascended.

25
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:23,734
I can see on your faces: Christ writ large
on your faces.

26
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:27,254
It’s beautifully shining in your eyes and
twinkling.

27
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:37,184
He’s there within us, in our hearts, in
our eyes, and He has resurrected Himself and

28
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,564
He has resurrected you, too.

29
00:02:39,564 --> 00:02:43,724
But now it is for you to resurrect other people.

30
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:49,624
You can resurrect other people, this is the
power you have got through Him, maybe, or

31
00:02:49,624 --> 00:02:51,654
through your Kundalini.

32
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:56,565
But you have this power to resurrect other
people, but first and foremost thing [is]

33
00:02:56,565 --> 00:03:03,784
you have to be strong like Christ: how He
obeyed His Mother and how He obeyed all the

34
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,784
demands of His life.

35
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:13,614
How He was committed and how He dedicated
Himself to this single task.

36
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:20,834
He didn’t bother as to develop His monetary
side or to become some sort of a big officer

37
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:27,244
or to become another great rider, or a swimmer,
or climb on the Alps, some sort of a thing

38
00:03:27,244 --> 00:03:29,434
like that.

39
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:35,564
(laughter) He didn’t try all these tricks,
and didn’t try to hanker after all these

40
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:42,014
things that sometimes make us quite mad.

41
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:55,794
What He did was to establish His identity
as the Brahma itself, as the Divine vibrations

42
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:58,584
itself, which He established.

43
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:08,034
And what you have to do is to establish yourself
as the resurrected people, as the realised-souls,

44
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:11,114
as the Sahaj Yogis.

45
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:14,233
And this is going to be very easy.

46
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:21,823
Now everything is made easy for you: your
realisation, then your powers, everything

47
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:25,584
has beautifully settled within you.

48
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:31,094
It has worked out so beautifully, slowly and
steadily.

49
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:44,923
I don’t think I have ever tried to force
you to do something or have compelled you

50
00:04:44,923 --> 00:04:45,923
to do something.

51
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:51,584
But through your own ascent you can see what’s
wrong with you or with the people about whom

52
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:54,024
we are talking.

53
00:04:54,024 --> 00:05:02,924
And then you can also know through all these
powers whatever is to be known.

54
00:05:02,924 --> 00:05:07,134
All that is unknown can be your own, everything.

55
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:11,884
But the attention should be towards your ascent,
towards the state.

56
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:17,044
Now ascent is not some sort of a physical
process.

57
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:20,444
It is not that you ascend some staircases.

58
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:22,004
It is a state.

59
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:26,514
It’s a state of your personality.

60
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:27,703
And there where I always say…

61
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,364
Excuse me, I think I’ll [remove my sweater].

62
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:34,394
The sun is showing its results.

63
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:36,064
See how the sun listens to me!

64
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:39,874
Can you help me, a little bit, to take out
things, thanks.

65
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:44,334
It’s very hot for me, I don’t know what
about you people.

66
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:58,983
He’s just telling me off (the Sun).

67
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:08,323
I forgot to tell you about the Sun so he’s
just troubling me, so I better tell! (laughter

68
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:13,924
and clapping).

69
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:33,704
They have been telling for the last one year,
you see, we’ve been thinking of coming here

70
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:36,214
for this puja.

71
00:06:36,214 --> 00:06:43,244
And I was very anxious that we should have
the Easter Puja here, but the dates were not

72
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:46,924
very suitable, because those days the moon
would be waning.

73
00:06:46,924 --> 00:06:50,664
So I thought, “How will I do it without
the moon?

74
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:52,504
We have to have the moon there.

75
00:06:52,504 --> 00:06:54,004
It’s important."

76
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:58,224
So I thought, “We’ll have it sometime
later."

77
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:03,104
And suddenly it happened that I have to come
here: luckily I was here.

78
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:07,244
And then on the television for the last one
week, they have been telling it’s going

79
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:14,564
to rain heavily, it’s going to be very clouded
(laughter) and the temperature is going to

80
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:22,874
be very bad and it’s going to be very, very
heavy rains.

81
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:29,264
(laughter and clapping).

82
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:41,744
And again and again, every night, every time
they announced about the weather it was looking

83
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:44,544
even worse, every time.

84
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:51,794
So I thought, “Now what to do?”

85
00:07:51,794 --> 00:07:59,194
(laughter) If you ask the clouds to move out
you have to have a tremendous breeze and that

86
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:03,314
may spoil your tent.

87
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:12,694
So somehow or other I just told the clouds
that, “You’d better move on to Newfoundland,

88
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:15,104
slowly, steadily, not with great speed."

89
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:20,624
And they did it.

90
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:23,594
And then the Sun which was very bright came
out.

91
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:28,034
Early in the morning I saw Him, red like my
sari.

92
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:29,334
So beautiful it was.

93
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:33,964
And you were all asleep but I was awake, very
early (laughter).

94
00:08:33,964 --> 00:08:39,944
And I was watching the way it came up: just
like my bindi it came up.

95
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:47,034
I saw it, and I said, “Look at the sun!

96
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:49,704
How obedient, how dedicated, how beautiful!”

97
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:56,744
Whatever it is: today is Mother’s Puja,
you have to have proper light, you have to

98
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,574
have proper temperature.

99
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:01,234
So look at the sky!

100
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:02,294
Look at everything!

101
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:05,634
And then gradually it became pink like your
faces.

102
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:06,914
It’s beautiful!

103
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:11,344
It became pink, beautifully pink, and then
now it’s shining.

104
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:18,604
I’m sorry I should have given full tribute
to the Sun, the way He has acted.

105
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:29,164
So that’s why He is troubling me a little
bit, you see, to remind me!

106
00:09:29,164 --> 00:09:38,044
So, as you know the Sun is the Agnya chakra.

107
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:43,274
Christ resides in the Sun.

108
00:09:43,274 --> 00:09:51,014
And in the body, in the being, He is the Spirit.

109
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:54,554
When He’s the Spirit, He’s the moon.

110
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:59,064
And when He acts on the Agnya He’s the Sun.

111
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:10,214
Now we have seen in His life that He was absolutely
spotlessly immaculate.

112
00:10:10,214 --> 00:10:13,904
He had no defects in Him.

113
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,894
He was a perfect personality.

114
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:22,844
“Then why did He want to resurrect?” one
can ask.

115
00:10:22,844 --> 00:10:27,424
What is in His time, is the resurrection.

116
00:10:27,424 --> 00:10:37,134
His resurrection is like making the way through
the Agnya chakra for all of you to pass through

117
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:38,904
it.

118
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:47,494
He was like the gate, or we should say He
was the One who opened the gate for all of

119
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:48,494
you.

120
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:57,134
Because He was so perfect, He had no problems
as we have of our chakras, our Kundalini.

121
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:58,734
He had no problems.

122
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:11,994
But He was the complete compassion in the
nature of vibrations: the vibrations became

123
00:11:11,994 --> 00:11:14,714
complete compassion.

124
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:23,494
So much so that even when He was resurrected
and even before that when He was crucified

125
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:32,824
He said, “Oh, God, the Father, please forgive
those people because they do not know what

126
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:34,854
they are doing."

127
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:38,424
Such forgiveness, such compassion!

128
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:44,574
And the Mother had to watch all that, keeping
quiet, because that was the game, that was

129
00:11:44,574 --> 00:11:47,674
the thing one had to do.

130
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:51,634
He had to play His game and He played it so
well.

131
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:58,644
So now when we talk about Christ, we have
to remember one thing: that He has done all

132
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:02,894
this for us, now what are we going to do for
Him?

133
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:05,924
He is the pattern we have to follow.

134
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:10,694
Supposing if that is the pattern we have to
follow, then it’s not that we carry the

135
00:12:10,694 --> 00:12:12,184
cross on our shoulder.

136
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:16,414
That’s not the pattern you have to follow.

137
00:12:16,414 --> 00:12:19,724
Many people think [that] because He carried
the cross, we can carry the cross.

138
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:21,974
Anybody can carry the cross!

139
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:29,734
In India, if you give about five rupees to
a loader, he can carry a cross across!

140
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:31,814
What is so great about it?

141
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:35,734
What is so great in carrying a cross on your
shoulder?

142
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:38,534
It’s nothing great.

143
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:41,764
Any wrestler can do it, anybody can do it.

144
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:44,094
That’s not the point!

145
00:12:44,094 --> 00:12:49,724
The point is we have to carry the work of
Christ, of resurrection.

146
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:51,974
That is what we have to realise.

147
00:12:51,974 --> 00:13:00,084
We have to understand the importance of our
being, of our lives, like Christ understood

148
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:03,384
that He has come for this great job here.

149
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:09,654
And though He came as a human being, though
He came as an ordinary son of an ordinary

150
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:10,654
carpenter.

151
00:13:10,654 --> 00:13:18,364
Though on this Earth He had a body and He
lived like other human beings, still He knew

152
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:23,594
what He had to do, He knew what He had to
achieve and He achieved it.

153
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:29,864
I think His was the most difficult task, which
He achieved and which He furnished it, so

154
00:13:29,864 --> 00:13:34,174
well, that today we are having all the benefits
of that.

155
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:38,604
Now let us see if we have done something for
Sahaj Yoga or not.

156
00:13:38,604 --> 00:13:42,754
We all should examine ourselves: what have
we done for Sahaj Yoga?

157
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:45,824
Not carrying the cross, I mean to say.

158
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:50,884
Some people think when they travel in India
and if they carry the luggage of people downward

159
00:13:50,884 --> 00:13:52,324
they are carrying the cross of Christ.

160
00:13:52,324 --> 00:13:54,594
That’s not the way!

161
00:13:54,594 --> 00:13:58,284
It’s something very, very serious one has
to think about.

162
00:13:58,284 --> 00:14:07,974
And that seriousness is: how far we have achieved
that state, for that what have we done?

163
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:15,354
And a simple thing I have been asking all
of you: you have to meditate every day!

164
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,944
All of you have to meditate everyday.

165
00:14:18,944 --> 00:14:23,884
But somehow nobody has time to meditate.

166
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:31,434
We are having these watches just to know that
we have to meditate, not for anything else.

167
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:33,714
Our lives are for meditation.

168
00:14:33,714 --> 00:14:38,754
You need not spend all your twenty-four hours,
but you have to meditate!

169
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:41,634
Everyday you must meditate.

170
00:14:41,634 --> 00:14:44,544
If you meditate your children will meditate.

171
00:14:44,544 --> 00:14:51,054
And meditation is such a simple thing for
you, made so easy that all the elements you

172
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:53,333
can see work it out.

173
00:14:53,333 --> 00:15:00,073
All your chakras are made of different elements
and when you clear out with the different

174
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:04,794
styles — I mean, you know all the methods
and the techniques of Sahaj Yoga — with

175
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:13,204
that when you clear out the chakras, when
you clear them out you are absolutely free,

176
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:17,634
absolutely at that stage where you have to
be.

177
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:23,554
But if you do not do this much even — is
to meditate — it’s going to be very, very

178
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:30,184
difficult for me and for you to achieve, for
which you have come on this Earth.

179
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:36,884
It’s a tremendous task that I have taken
over, I know that, but I know how to do it,

180
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:39,024
and you also know how to do it.

181
00:15:39,024 --> 00:15:43,634
But the trouble is you get entangled into
your different conditionings.

182
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:50,854
Now, by now you must have realised, all these
so-called religions in anybody’s name: whether

183
00:15:50,854 --> 00:15:56,214
it is in the name of Islam, in the name of
Christianity, in the name of Hinduism, in

184
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:59,864
the name of Sikhism — all this is falsehood.

185
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:05,484
It has no truth in it.

186
00:16:05,484 --> 00:16:09,444
They have all tried to use it for their own
purposes.

187
00:16:09,444 --> 00:16:17,404
There’s only one truth and that is: all
these great prophets and all these great incarnations

188
00:16:17,404 --> 00:16:23,964
came on this Earth for your ascent and not
for establishing those religions who are just

189
00:16:23,964 --> 00:16:26,454
interested in money.

190
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:32,634
In these religions also you will find there
are people who are either left-sided or right-sided.

191
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:37,814
There are some religions which preach you
should be very, very strict: you should not

192
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:42,714
do this, you should not do that, you should
not drink, you should not smoke.

193
00:16:42,714 --> 00:16:47,094
There are some who say you should not marry,
you should not look at women, you should not

194
00:16:47,094 --> 00:16:50,604
look at men — all kinds of restrictions.

195
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:54,474
Even in Hinduism you will be surprised, there
are so many restrictions.

196
00:16:54,474 --> 00:17:05,904
If you see the amount of superstitions that
exist and that are created by brahmins in

197
00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:07,224
India you will be shocked.

198
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:12,084
For everything there’s a superstition: if
you walk with the left hand ahead, that means

199
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:16,984
this, if you walk with the right hand, then
that means this; if you sit like this, that

200
00:17:16,984 --> 00:17:17,984
means that.

201
00:17:17,984 --> 00:17:18,984
Everything!

202
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:24,074
They have made a human being into a machine
and there’s no spontaneity about it.

203
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:27,304
All kinds of absurdities there are in Islam,
too.

204
00:17:27,304 --> 00:17:33,524
But when we find them in a free place like
England, where there’s complete left-sidedness,

205
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:37,954
where you can do what you like but still you
are a Christian: if you drink, it’s all

206
00:17:37,954 --> 00:17:43,834
right; if you have ten wives, it’s all right;
if you have fifteen keeps, it’s all right.

207
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:49,964
Anything you do is all right as long as you
go to church and pay money!

208
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:55,254
So there’s nothing [forbidden], especially
for the Protestants – that’s the religion

209
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:59,534
I was born in, where everything is allowed.

210
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:04,184
Now when we come to this kind of a thing,
what is the Christian religion is, then, comes

211
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:08,564
to, that, if you ask them the road, they’ll
tell you which way to go — that’s Christianity.

212
00:18:08,564 --> 00:18:11,174
It’s coming to that end.

213
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:18,424
Now, all these religions either are indulging
into the Right Side or onto the Left Side.

214
00:18:18,424 --> 00:18:22,024
Some people like the Left Side and some people
like the Right Side.

215
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:26,694
I will tell you the story of a priest, I went
to see him in Russia.

216
00:18:26,694 --> 00:18:29,424
I think I have told it to some people before.

217
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:35,154
I went to Russia and the Russian people asked
me, “What would you like to see?”

218
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:39,064
So I told them I would like to go and see
some churches.

219
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:41,704
So they said, “All right, very good, we’ll
take you to a church."

220
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:48,144
So they took me to church and it was that
Greek Orthodox Church, and a Black Order,

221
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:49,214
which is supposed to be the highest.

222
00:18:49,214 --> 00:18:51,514
I don’t know how they call it.

223
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:58,064
So we went inside and the priest said, “All
right, today I’m sorry, we cannot offer

224
00:18:58,064 --> 00:19:00,584
you meat because our fasting is there.

225
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:02,464
But we’ll have lunch."

226
00:19:02,464 --> 00:19:04,434
So we had a very sumptuous lunch and all that.

227
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:09,324
But the priest was only busy drinking, because
it was a fasting, so drinking is allowed,

228
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:10,324
according to them!

229
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:13,144
So he was drinking and drinking and drinking.

230
00:19:13,144 --> 00:19:16,234
He drank so much that he forgot we were there!

231
00:19:16,234 --> 00:19:20,404
We were supposed to be VIPs: just lost himself
into drinking!

232
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:23,784
So we thought better now have an honourable
retreat.

233
00:19:23,784 --> 00:19:30,104
So we got up and walked out of that place
and this fellow didn’t even come to wish

234
00:19:30,104 --> 00:19:31,104
us.

235
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:34,414
And these officers, the Russian officers,
didn’t drink, and didn’t do anything,

236
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:36,094
and they were laughing and laughing.

237
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:37,644
He said, “See now, this is Christianity!

238
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,894
That’s why we didn’t want to take to Christianity."

239
00:19:40,894 --> 00:19:44,014
So I said, “But see, that’s not Christ."

240
00:19:44,014 --> 00:19:47,564
They said, “That’s true, but what these
people are saying, is it Christianity?”

241
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:50,064
I said, “It’s not."

242
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:59,934
Now this gentleman, was supposed to be the
highest person in spirituality living in Russia!

243
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:02,604
So they have told me a story about the tzars.

244
00:20:02,604 --> 00:20:07,504
You see, tzars wanted to have some religion
because they thought, “Everybody’s having

245
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:09,244
a religion, we have no religion.

246
00:20:09,244 --> 00:20:11,334
Must have some religion."

247
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:19,114
So they sent for some people and the people
who came forward were Catholics to begin with.

248
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:24,164
So the Catholics said, “All right, you can
drink in Catholic religion."

249
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:27,404
I don’t know how they got this idea, but
it’s all right.

250
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:33,554
“Catholic religion you can drink but you
cannot have more than one wife."

251
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:35,654
The tzar said, “No, that’s not possible!

252
00:20:35,654 --> 00:20:38,704
We have to have many tsarinas, you see, for
different purposes.

253
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,614
So we can’t have that religion!”

254
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:43,274
So they cancelled it.

255
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:48,704
So then the Islam: you see that time I think
they were no hindus available, thank God!

256
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:55,834
They had the Islam, Islam people went, and
the Islamic people said, “No, all right,

257
00:20:55,834 --> 00:21:01,974
you can have five wives, it’s all right,
but you cannot drink."

258
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:05,464
They said, “That’s impossible!

259
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,734
How can we follow Islam?

260
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,104
That’s not possible!”

261
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:10,494
So, cancel it!

262
00:21:10,494 --> 00:21:15,324
So these orthodox people — orthodox, you
see, the word orthodox remember that — they

263
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:16,324
came.

264
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:18,974
They said, “No, we are just in the centre,
you see.

265
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:25,654
We don’t mind if you drink, we don’t mind
if you have many wives, we don’t mind.

266
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:27,664
Only thing is, you have to pay us well!”

267
00:21:27,664 --> 00:21:31,774
Tzars said, “All right, that’s good, let’s
have this religion!”

268
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:36,494
And that’s how they had this religion there.

269
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:39,114
So this is the situation of the religion today.

270
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:48,894
All these religions have become sort of deformed
statues, good for nothing.

271
00:21:48,894 --> 00:21:56,354
So now the inner religion within us is the
Sahaja dharma, which has to be fully followed.

272
00:21:56,354 --> 00:22:01,994
Now, I told, in India, that now you are all
become Sahajas.

273
00:22:01,994 --> 00:22:09,524
The story is like this, that there was a villager
who became a Christian.

274
00:22:09,524 --> 00:22:13,304
So he came down to Allahabad to become Christian.

275
00:22:13,304 --> 00:22:18,534
So he told them that, “You have to give
me a big name because now I am Saheb, I have

276
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:19,734
become an English man.

277
00:22:19,734 --> 00:22:20,814
So you better give me a big name."

278
00:22:20,814 --> 00:22:21,894
They said, “What name you want?”

279
00:22:21,894 --> 00:22:25,184
He said “Give me the name of Alexander the
Great!”

280
00:22:25,184 --> 00:22:26,914
So they called him Alexander.

281
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:29,274
But his name was Blondie, you see.

282
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:35,314
His real Indian name was Bhoora, so they called
him Alexander Bhoora.

283
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:36,314
So Mr.

284
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:41,724
Alexander Bhoora came to Allahabad and went
to the River Ganges for having his bath.

285
00:22:41,724 --> 00:22:45,554
So the priest said, the pastor, he said, “You
can’t do that!”

286
00:22:45,554 --> 00:22:46,684
He said, “Why?

287
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:48,564
Why can’t I do that?”

288
00:22:48,564 --> 00:22:51,874
He said, “No, you can’t go and have bath
in the River Ganges because the Christianity

289
00:22:51,874 --> 00:22:52,874
will drop out, you see!”

290
00:22:52,874 --> 00:22:54,954
If he goes and has a bath in the River Ganges.

291
00:22:54,954 --> 00:22:58,214
He said, “This you can’t do!”

292
00:22:58,214 --> 00:23:04,374
So Alexander Bhoora said, “If I have become
saheb, I have become Englishman, that doesn’t

293
00:23:04,374 --> 00:23:07,334
mean I have given up my religion!”

294
00:23:07,334 --> 00:23:08,334
You see!

295
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:16,054
This is exactly what is happening to us when
we try to follow any religion whatsoever.

296
00:23:16,054 --> 00:23:20,224
Now we are all identified with our so-called
religions in which we were born.

297
00:23:20,224 --> 00:23:25,714
For example, if I told Indians, “Now, you
don’t go to temples!

298
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:31,494
You are not to go to any temple, even if it
is a swayambhu temple, unless and until you

299
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:35,094
have told me, don’t go to a swayambhu temple
at any cost."

300
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:43,604
There are many churches also where there are
very good statues, we can say, or have got

301
00:23:43,604 --> 00:23:46,974
something which are really swayambhus, but
they are very few.

302
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:49,964
So you tell me and then go.

303
00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:55,704
But they wouldn’t listen to me, they won’t
listen, and when they go there they catch

304
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:56,924
on their Agnyas.

305
00:23:56,924 --> 00:24:03,484
Once I went to see one temple which was of
course a swayambhu temple, no doubt, so some

306
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,884
Sahaj Yogis decided to go there.

307
00:24:05,884 --> 00:24:09,114
But I didn’t ask them, they didn’t tell
me.

308
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,014
When they came back, as soon as they saw me,
they all fainted.

309
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:13,014
I said, “What happened?

310
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:14,044
Where did you go?”

311
00:24:14,044 --> 00:24:16,104
“Oh, we went to this temple."

312
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:17,104
I said, “Why?

313
00:24:17,104 --> 00:24:18,224
You never told me.

314
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:19,528
And what do you have here [on your forehead]?”

315
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:23,364
You see, the Brahmin put the teeka (bindi)
and it’s finished!

316
00:24:23,364 --> 00:24:26,284
Then it took them one month to clear out!

317
00:24:26,284 --> 00:24:32,024
Now they don’t go, they’ve had enough
of it.

318
00:24:32,024 --> 00:24:38,904
Same with the Christians: now the other day
I heard about the Paris episode where people

319
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:45,904
wanted to have weddings in the church, in
Paris.

320
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:47,593
So they must have special dresses!

321
00:24:47,593 --> 00:24:52,674
So somebody came here to buy some special
dresses from…what shop is that?

322
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:55,874
I forgot the name, some big name.

323
00:24:55,874 --> 00:25:02,474
So the special dresses must be worn because
they have to go to the church!

324
00:25:02,474 --> 00:25:08,184
And when they came out of the church with
those dresses, they had become bhoots.

325
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:12,094
I was surprised, what has happened to these
twenty-five of them?

326
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:16,714
What has happened is that in the church there
are many dead bodies buried, and they are

327
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:18,994
all caught up.

328
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:25,784
So when you go also to see the beautiful architecture,
go with a detached mind.

329
00:25:25,784 --> 00:25:28,924
Don’t think that you belong to that church.

330
00:25:28,924 --> 00:25:31,044
You don’t belong to any church.

331
00:25:31,044 --> 00:25:33,144
You don’t belong to any temple.

332
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:37,904
Don’t belong to any one of these forms,
then only you will ascend.

333
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:46,924
And I have to tell you today that Christ did
not belong to any religion.

334
00:25:46,924 --> 00:25:49,144
He didn’t follow any religion.

335
00:25:49,144 --> 00:25:52,374
He followed His own spiritual religion.

336
00:25:52,374 --> 00:25:58,404
When He went to one church where there were
people who were discussing, I mean they were

337
00:25:58,404 --> 00:26:02,024
Jews, He went there and He was talking to
them.

338
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:07,924
The other day I saw a beautiful painting they
had given on the newspaper, a very beautiful

339
00:26:07,924 --> 00:26:13,684
famous painting where Christ is talking to
the doctors and He is holding His, rubbing

340
00:26:13,684 --> 00:26:23,984
His Left Swadhishthana, very nicely, and all
the doctors, one of them is listening to Him,

341
00:26:23,984 --> 00:26:28,724
one of them is looking at Him, sneering at
Him, another one is little bit paying attention

342
00:26:28,724 --> 00:26:29,724
to Him.

343
00:26:29,724 --> 00:26:32,064
He’s just rubbing His Left Swadhishthan.

344
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,914
It’s clearly [shown].

345
00:26:33,914 --> 00:26:37,634
You can see it so clearly!

346
00:26:37,634 --> 00:26:42,146
And so now, with these new achievements, you
must rise above all these things and you must

347
00:26:42,146 --> 00:26:47,724
understand that we have to be very independently
looking at ourselves.

348
00:26:47,724 --> 00:26:51,454
We are no more belonging to any religion.

349
00:26:51,454 --> 00:26:57,684
We belong to the religion of God which is
Sahaj.

350
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:04,634
And Sahaj is the religion, it will spread
only when you really become nothing but Sahaj.

351
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:09,024
But that’s something I don’t understand
— it doesn’t work out.

352
00:27:09,024 --> 00:27:16,074
I met somebody from, I forget that, there
was, say, called ‘Hamaty’ or something

353
00:27:16,074 --> 00:27:21,884
who was supposed to be an incarnation or something.

354
00:27:21,884 --> 00:27:27,194
His disciples absolutely, I should say that
they behave in such a manner that you can’t

355
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:31,074
believe it: how ardently they believe in this
man.

356
00:27:31,074 --> 00:27:37,874
Whatever he says, whatever he does, how they
believe in him.

357
00:27:37,874 --> 00:27:39,384
It’s very surprising.

358
00:27:39,384 --> 00:27:47,114
You meet anyone who is following any guru,
anyone, you’ll be surprised the way they

359
00:27:47,114 --> 00:27:51,804
are fanatic about this fellow and they will
not hear anything against.

360
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:58,224
Leave alone that, but if he says, “You stand
on your head for the whole night,” they

361
00:27:58,224 --> 00:27:59,255
will do it!

362
00:27:59,255 --> 00:28:04,394
I don’t know what happens: when it comes
to falsehood, we try to follow it, and when

363
00:28:04,394 --> 00:28:12,444
we know the truth, this is the truth, then
we take advantage and we try to compromise.

364
00:28:12,444 --> 00:28:19,994
We think the truth will not do anything about
it.

365
00:28:19,994 --> 00:28:24,264
Not that truth will punish you, it will not,
because you are realised-souls.

366
00:28:24,264 --> 00:28:26,424
It will not.

367
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:30,184
It will not punish you up to a point.

368
00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:37,324
But remember that Ekadasha is absolutely working
at the same time.

369
00:28:37,324 --> 00:28:44,264
If we do anything wrong, like these people
went to the church, they were all caught up.

370
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:47,834
Now they may say that, “Mother, why should
we be caught up?

371
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:51,104
We are Sahaj Yogis."

372
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:55,684
Because you are vulnerable, you are vulnerable.

373
00:28:55,684 --> 00:28:58,694
Yet you have not reached that stage.

374
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:03,494
If you reach that stage, then when you go
there, all the church people will come out

375
00:29:03,494 --> 00:29:06,264
of the church and run away.

376
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:09,684
They’ll start shaking before you.

377
00:29:09,684 --> 00:29:11,284
They will not know what has happened.

378
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:17,404
I have seen when I enter into any church all
the candles start going chuk, chuk, chuk,

379
00:29:17,404 --> 00:29:21,054
chuk, chuk, chuk, and people start wondering
what has happened.

380
00:29:21,054 --> 00:29:27,244
Even when they are having a dinner or something
and there is a candlelight dinner I am surprised

381
00:29:27,244 --> 00:29:31,474
the way every candle starts flickering and
people start looking.

382
00:29:31,474 --> 00:29:37,504
Because the bhoots are sitting before them,
you see, so the candles immediately show that

383
00:29:37,504 --> 00:29:39,304
these are the bhoots sitting here.

384
00:29:39,304 --> 00:29:44,904
With all this knowledge that you have, the
light you have within yourself, by which you

385
00:29:44,904 --> 00:29:49,524
are enlightened, still if you are going to
these left and right-sided things, it’s

386
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:51,333
very, very dangerous.

387
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:59,054
We see that also, today, I must tell you about
the part that is politics.

388
00:29:59,054 --> 00:30:03,394
In politics also these people have developed
two types of theories: one is left-sided,

389
00:30:03,394 --> 00:30:04,843
one right-sided.

390
00:30:04,843 --> 00:30:10,804
The left-sided theories are democratic, where
you can indulge into anything you like.

391
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:13,404
It’s the individual that is important.

392
00:30:13,404 --> 00:30:18,444
The individual indulges into everything and
you should not stop him from doing whatever

393
00:30:18,444 --> 00:30:22,444
he likes, he’s an individual: so he has
a right to cut his nose, he has a right to

394
00:30:22,444 --> 00:30:26,354
cut his eyes, to do what he likes.

395
00:30:26,354 --> 00:30:33,894
An individual is allowed to do what he likes
to do, and then what happens [is] that we

396
00:30:33,894 --> 00:30:39,854
find this democracy becomes a demonocracy:
everybody is a demon.

397
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:48,524
Everybody is busy cutting throats, cutting
all the basis and the roots of life because

398
00:30:48,524 --> 00:30:54,334
everybody is Brahma, becomes a great personality,
because the individual is so great and the

399
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:58,134
collective is lost, completely lost.

400
00:30:58,134 --> 00:31:06,814
But on the other side, where it is more discipline,
more aggressiveness, more controls and everything

401
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:11,944
[with] the Right Side, which we can call as
communism, where people are controlled all

402
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:13,264
the time.

403
00:31:13,264 --> 00:31:14,264
Now why?

404
00:31:14,264 --> 00:31:18,244
Because for the collective the individual
must sacrifice.

405
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:23,604
In that case, the individuals become weak
and if the individuals are weak, then the

406
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:27,024
collective cannot be strong: it cannot be
strong.

407
00:31:27,024 --> 00:31:28,894
The individuals have to be strong.

408
00:31:28,894 --> 00:31:35,634
For example, you will see that the people
who come from communist countries, they drink

409
00:31:35,634 --> 00:31:38,874
more than people who can drink here.

410
00:31:38,874 --> 00:31:44,333
Or those who come, say from Islamic countries,
where they don’t touch anything, can drink

411
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,604
more than even sardarjees.

412
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:52,734
So you can imagine what is the situation of
human beings is that, out of fear if you try

413
00:31:52,734 --> 00:31:56,054
to control him, he goes to the Right Side.

414
00:31:56,054 --> 00:32:04,943
But he is in no way perfected, he’s not
transformed, he doesn’t accept the situation,

415
00:32:04,943 --> 00:32:11,364
he doesn’t become that, he doesn’t have
that power to control himself.

416
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:16,224
He doesn’t get over his sinning aptitudes.

417
00:32:16,224 --> 00:32:18,564
He’s still there.

418
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:21,514
As soon as he gets a chance he falls into
it.

419
00:32:21,514 --> 00:32:23,094
So that fails.

420
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:25,844
So the individuals are weak in that case.

421
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:32,854
And where there is complete abandonment, do
what you like, live the way you like, indulgences,

422
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:35,403
all kinds of things, so you find [decadence].

423
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:41,074
I mean, everyday you see and you say, “Oh
God, this is a decadent society, this is happening!”

424
00:32:41,074 --> 00:32:47,984
Decadence is because an individual [to] whom
you have given all these powers, has no power

425
00:32:47,984 --> 00:32:49,074
to bear them.

426
00:32:49,074 --> 00:32:52,634
An individual cannot bear money.

427
00:32:52,634 --> 00:32:55,844
He cannot bear power of any kind.

428
00:32:55,844 --> 00:32:58,764
He cannot bear love.

429
00:32:58,764 --> 00:33:02,084
He cannot bear kindness.

430
00:33:02,084 --> 00:33:08,494
He cannot understand peace because he’s
still an individual.

431
00:33:08,494 --> 00:33:15,754
But when an individual becomes the collective
— this is the ascent through the central

432
00:33:15,754 --> 00:33:25,904
path — when he becomes the collective, in
his strength he strengthens the collective.

433
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:32,054
And also the collective looks after, protects,
and guides the individual.

434
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:33,964
This is what Sahaj Yoga is.

435
00:33:33,964 --> 00:33:40,244
So the politics of Sahaj Yoga is that you
have to become the collective personality.

436
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:50,784
And there where we feel that still we are
something great, we are different, we are

437
00:33:50,784 --> 00:33:58,734
Indians or we are from England or from France,
still if you are identified then you are not

438
00:33:58,734 --> 00:34:00,374
collective.

439
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:06,464
In collective sense we are all one, part and
parcel of one being.

440
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:12,054
Then you are really acting as collective being
and you are one with the Divine.

441
00:34:12,054 --> 00:34:16,403
Where the Sun is looking after you, the Moon
is looking after you, the winds are looking

442
00:34:16,403 --> 00:34:24,054
after you; all the Mother Earth and all these
elements are working.

443
00:34:24,054 --> 00:34:32,784
Ether, everything is working for you and you
are so well-protected and blessed by the special

444
00:34:32,784 --> 00:34:36,614
quality to enjoy the joy.

445
00:34:36,614 --> 00:34:43,054
Then you really become sensitive to that joy,
when you are one with the whole.

446
00:34:43,054 --> 00:34:49,874
Like if supposing this finger or this finger
is not one with the whole, is numbed out…as

447
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:54,884
it happens in leprosy, what happens that this
finger becomes numbed out.

448
00:34:54,884 --> 00:35:03,924
Even if a rat eats it off we don’t know
because there is no connection, no nerves

449
00:35:03,924 --> 00:35:05,994
acting, it’s insensitive.

450
00:35:05,994 --> 00:35:13,534
In the same way if you are not collective
and not bothered about collective you are

451
00:35:13,534 --> 00:35:17,304
going to be dropped out.

452
00:35:17,304 --> 00:35:25,614
You are not going to be there to enjoy the
beauties of your own glory and that of the

453
00:35:25,614 --> 00:35:27,174
collective.

454
00:35:27,174 --> 00:35:33,114
So one has to understand that we have to be
strong ourselves, we have to ascend and we

455
00:35:33,114 --> 00:35:34,534
have to be collective.

456
00:35:34,534 --> 00:35:38,774
It’s very easy to find out faults with others.

457
00:35:38,774 --> 00:35:41,234
Very easy to find faults with the leaders.

458
00:35:41,234 --> 00:35:46,534
Very easy also to find faults also with Sahaj
Yoga, sometimes with me.

459
00:35:46,534 --> 00:35:49,264
Better find faults with yourself.

460
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:51,974
The rest I’ll look after.

461
00:35:51,974 --> 00:35:58,874
First you just find faults with yourself and
try to understand others and love others and

462
00:35:58,874 --> 00:36:01,754
enjoy the company of others.

463
00:36:01,754 --> 00:36:10,084
This, once you decide that we have to enjoy,
I tell you, it’s so spontaneous.

464
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:17,054
Just this decision, this faith, within you
that, “I’m going to enjoy now my Spirit.

465
00:36:17,054 --> 00:36:21,964
I’m going to enjoy the collective within
me,” that’s the Spirit.

466
00:36:21,964 --> 00:36:26,954
Just this decision itself will give you the
power to enjoy.

467
00:36:26,954 --> 00:36:34,914
But the decision should be firm, no hypocrisy,
no playing games, no ego, no conditioning,

468
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:41,504
nothing, just pure desire within us that we
have to be the Spirit.

469
00:36:41,504 --> 00:36:45,834
And the Spirit which is the collective being
within us.

470
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:55,444
I hope today on this day of resurrection,
we have to be thankful to Christ very much

471
00:36:55,444 --> 00:37:08,584
for showing us the way and also we have to
be very much concerned and alerted about ourselves:

472
00:37:08,584 --> 00:37:09,984
Where are we?

473
00:37:09,984 --> 00:37:11,844
Where do we stand?

474
00:37:11,844 --> 00:37:13,504
What are we up to?

475
00:37:13,504 --> 00:37:15,604
What are we doing?

476
00:37:15,604 --> 00:37:17,614
What is our responsibility?

477
00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:19,524
What is expected of us?

478
00:37:19,524 --> 00:37:22,364
Why all these blessings are given to us?

479
00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:26,774
There’s no sacrifice in Sahaj Yoga, no sacrifice.

480
00:37:26,774 --> 00:37:35,164
Nobody wants you anything to commit or to
do or membership or anything like that.

481
00:37:35,164 --> 00:37:36,884
I think it’s my commitment.

482
00:37:36,884 --> 00:37:46,384
As I said, that God has the commitment but
you also have one commitment that your desire

483
00:37:46,384 --> 00:37:47,384
should be pure.

484
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:51,984
That’s the only thing, that, “Let my desire
be pure!

485
00:37:51,984 --> 00:37:55,524
No impurities of any kind, should work it
out."

486
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:59,274
As Christ had His desire, so pure, and that’s
what He achieved.

487
00:37:59,274 --> 00:38:03,354
I am sure you can all achieve a lot in your
life.

488
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:05,403
Today is my sixty-fifth birthday.

489
00:38:05,403 --> 00:38:13,124
Now imagine, I’m sixty-five years of age
and at this age most of the ladies, you see,

490
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:19,014
just, I don’t know what they do.

491
00:38:19,014 --> 00:38:20,014
(laughter)

492
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:31,564
So now you must come up and work out everything
as far as possible, thinking that we all have

493
00:38:31,564 --> 00:38:32,564
to stand up.

494
00:38:32,564 --> 00:38:34,344
Now the children are coming up.

495
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:36,404
They are also going to stand up.

496
00:38:36,404 --> 00:38:39,274
You are all looking younger to me and younger
to me.

497
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:41,284
Every day I see you, you look younger.

498
00:38:41,284 --> 00:38:45,234
Sometimes I don’t even recognise you, the
way you look younger and I think, is he the

499
00:38:45,234 --> 00:38:53,374
son or is he the father?

500
00:38:53,374 --> 00:39:01,954
The situation is such that you are all blessed:
you’ve got jobs, you’ve got everything.

501
00:39:01,954 --> 00:39:05,364
And everybody tells me, “Mother, this is
what has happened, that has happened!” everything.

502
00:39:05,364 --> 00:39:06,764
Now, so what?

503
00:39:06,764 --> 00:39:10,614
These are temptations, be careful.

504
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:12,383
This is not what you wanted.

505
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:20,994
What you wanted is the state of that complete
faith within yourself where you don’t have

506
00:39:20,994 --> 00:39:27,204
to ask, nothing — everything will work out.

507
00:39:27,204 --> 00:39:28,204
It works!

508
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:30,324
That’s [what] the point is.

509
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:39,764
So, I hope next time when we meet I’ll see
even younger people than what I see today

510
00:39:39,764 --> 00:39:42,894
and I’ll be able to recognise you.

511
00:39:42,894 --> 00:39:46,334
Christ died at a very, very young age, very
young age.

512
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:48,874
He was very young, I must say.

513
00:39:48,874 --> 00:39:54,194
But how much He has done for humanity.

514
00:39:54,194 --> 00:39:58,064
Nobody could have achieved that much in that
small age as He has done it.

515
00:39:58,064 --> 00:39:59,204
It’s remarkable!

516
00:39:59,204 --> 00:40:00,914
It’s really remarkable!

517
00:40:00,914 --> 00:40:06,124
That’s what I expect you to follow, His
footsteps in doing remarkable things.

518
00:40:06,124 --> 00:40:11,244
And let me see all of you, every one of you
have to do something great.

519
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:14,034
And today is the day of certain promises.

520
00:40:14,034 --> 00:40:15,404
May God bless you for that.

521
00:40:15,404 --> 00:40:18,664
And I thank you very much for this birthday
of mine.
