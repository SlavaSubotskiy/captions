00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:22,897
Navaratri Puja, Cabella Ligure, 24.10.1993

2
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:27,496
H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

3
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:56,605
Today we have gathered here to do the Puja of the Devi.

4
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:03,877
The Devi has many forms

5
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:10,124
but is the embodiment of the shakti.

6
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:19,173
Adishakti gives shakti to all these embodiments.

7
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:26,087
And so there are many Goddesses we have at different times.

8
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:33,587
They came on this earth and did all that was necessary

9
00:02:33,788 --> 00:02:38,595
for the ascent of people who were seekers.

10
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:48,005
Specially the one we know of Jagadamba, the Durga.

11
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:56,904
She was trying to protect all the seekers of truth

12
00:02:57,105 --> 00:03:05,193
and to destroy all evil forces

13
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:12,052
because without the ascent of human beings,

14
00:03:12,253 --> 00:03:15,880
they do not know the truth.

15
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:18,739
And that’s why

16
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,270
whatever they try to do is a mental projection.

17
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,606
And this mental projection,

18
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:33,835
if it is not substantiated by truth, by dharma, it declines.

19
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,144
In Sanskrit they call it glaani.

20
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:45,348
When this glaani takes place

21
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:52,564
then incarnations are born to solve the problem.

22
00:03:55,952 --> 00:04:01,603
In all incarnations of the Goddess,

23
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:07,837
there have been, very much incarnated the satanic forces.

24
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:14,712
They had incarnated and She had to fight them, with them

25
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:18,407
and destroy them.

26
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:23,430
But this destruction was not for the destruction sake

27
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:27,500
that the evil forces are to be destroyed

28
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:33,727
but evil forces always try to put down the seekers,

29
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:38,133
put down the saints, try to harm them,

30
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:42,740
sometimes even destroy.

31
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,526
All these destructive forces

32
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:55,674
do not come at the same time, normally.

33
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:59,799
At different times is easy to handle

34
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,893
but the aim of the incarnation is to save,

35
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:07,877
to protect the people who are seekers

36
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:11,236
because they are the most important people

37
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:15,314
in the realm of spirituality.

38
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:21,752
All others are nothing but dust, good for nothing, useless.

39
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:27,502
If they are not seeking the truth in the eyes of God,

40
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:33,066
they are just useless lives that have come

41
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,863
and will be finished.

42
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:39,347
They have no value and they have no dignity.

43
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:43,878
They have no understanding of anything.

44
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,612
So in the judgment of the divine love,

45
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:51,339
we have two types of people:

46
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:58,941
one who are seekers of truth and the another who are not.

47
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:02,510
They may be good people. They’ll be nice people,

48
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:06,362
they'll be doing us lot of good works: social work, this work,

49
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:10,495
missionary work, every sort of work they might be doing.

50
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:14,003
But if they are not seeking the truth then

51
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:16,667
they do not come to that category

52
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:21,657
where God has to incarnate.

53
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:25,815
So try to understand the preciousness,

54
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:30,062
the importance of seekers.

55
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,727
And that’s what you have been – seeking.

56
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:39,628
Very few persons,

57
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:43,566
if you take the percentage, are seeker.

58
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:47,027
Is very, very wee bit.

59
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:49,761
But it's very important

60
00:06:49,962 --> 00:07:02,101
because, say, a one little part of gold

61
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:08,880
is much more valuable than mounds of steel.

62
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:14,562
In the same way, a seeker is much more valuable

63
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:17,445
in the growth of spirituality.

64
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:21,578
The whole universe was created,

65
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:26,750
whole atmosphere was built,

66
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:30,352
all the evolution took place for what –

67
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:35,599
that human beings should know the truth.

68
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:41,806
But in the modern atmosphere, it’s a very big curse – I think

69
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:45,782
the greatest evil than all the Shumbha Nishumbhas

70
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:51,790
and all that – the worst of all is materialism

71
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:55,610
because materialism makes you gross.

72
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:58,352
In your seeking also when you are rising,

73
00:07:58,553 --> 00:08:03,795
subtly that materialism catches you.

74
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:07,740
I have been noticing this.

75
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,633
When people come to Sahaja Yoga,

76
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:17,930
right, they are going deep into themselves.

77
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,258
They are understanding what I am saying.

78
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,250
All the inner knowledge they want to know,

79
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:30,023
what is called as atmagyan. Atmagyan means two things:

80
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:35,711
the knowledge about the spirit and knowledge about yourself.

81
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:43,021
All this they find out and they know what it is.

82
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:52,417
This state is the state for which people have been doing

83
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:56,029
all kinds of things: going to the Himalayas,

84
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,396
meditating in the cold without much clothes on them,

85
00:09:01,597 --> 00:09:06,479
living in the caves with some fruits.

86
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:09,678
All kinds of tapasyas they would do

87
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:18,060
because the seeking was so deep, so urgent,

88
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:24,191
and they could not get out of that force of seeking.

89
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:32,421
But in the modern times, materialism retards

90
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:39,819
that hankering, that dedication.

91
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:46,475
It's maddening for people when they are seekers.

92
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:50,592
I have seen before coming to Sahaja Yoga,

93
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:56,553
people spend lot of money, go to various places,

94
00:09:56,754 --> 00:10:01,842
go to Himalayas, go to Nepal, go to Japan,

95
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:06,347
all over the places they are moving.

96
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,600
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

97
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:13,709
after they have become the Spirits,

98
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:20,631
for the growth of your new awareness

99
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:23,904
the progress is retarded.

100
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:27,295
Also one should understand that

101
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:31,873
after so much of running about, you find something so precious

102
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:34,154
so you settle down with that.

103
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:38,662
And you feel very satisfied about it. That part is all right.

104
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:42,365
But what later?

105
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:46,370
Your growth should not stop.

106
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:49,396
And that stops because,

107
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:55,425
because of one of the main reasons is materialism.

108
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,654
Because of materialism, your faith in yourself is also less.

109
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:09,244
Now as you have seen that the Gods prayed to the Goddess

110
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:15,812
and She came and killed all the negative forces.

111
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,955
Reason was the earnest desire of the Gods

112
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:27,228
compelled Her to take incarnation.

113
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:31,587
Such sincere desire for ascent

114
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:39,689
that they could not get sometimes food, even water,

115
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:46,158
and they worked so hard for their ascent

116
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:50,859
which was disturbed by negative forces.

117
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:59,273
So their call was so from the heart,

118
00:11:59,474 --> 00:12:04,101
so desperate and genuine and sincere

119
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:12,031
that the Goddess had to take birth on this earth to save them,

120
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:18,083
to protect them, to look after them.

121
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:23,801
But, as it is we see,

122
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:28,778
once you have reached a destination,

123
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:33,455
you feel now, better settle down.

124
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:40,463
Now, what do you, we settle down with?

125
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:48,973
If after getting realization you are complete,

126
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:54,489
you are in totality, you are absolutely one with reality,

127
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,315
there’s nothing to be done.

128
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:02,216
You become a saint.

129
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:06,599
And a saint does not need any advertisement,

130
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,146
does not need anything. His message spreads.

131
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:14,576
People see him and know he is a great saint.

132
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:18,303
So many saints did not even leave their houses.

133
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:21,225
A very common saying in India,

134
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,561
“Your takiya you should not leave that,”

135
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:27,920
the pillow on which you are resting, you should not leave.

136
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:33,795
That was a criteria of a guru. Those who have to seek

137
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:38,498
should come to the gurus and climb up,

138
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,139
at least six seven miles up,

139
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,944
and then the guru doesn’t meet anyone. He may slap you.

140
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:50,850
He may hit you. He may drop you from that high mountain.

141
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:56,248
He'll take your test by so many ways.

142
00:13:56,449 --> 00:14:01,264
Ultimately he may select one person to give realization.

143
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:05,366
So this hankering, this desperate effort

144
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,957
was all the time there.

145
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:17,715
Now, so we come to Sahaja Yoga in these modern times.

146
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:27,960
Sometimes I feel that not only Sahaja Yoga is very easy

147
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:34,179
also it is extremely pampering.

148
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,312
You know you have got realization.

149
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:42,109
You all know that you are better than others,

150
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,617
that you have got rid of so many problems

151
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:48,469
and that now you have become master of your own.

152
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:59,820
Then the responsibility that you have towards yourself

153
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:04,703
and to your fellow men reduces

154
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:09,797
because you feel very satisfied with yourself.

155
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:12,283
The other day some Sahaja yogini rang Me up.

156
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:16,601
I mean, they ring Me up for everything.

157
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:22,080
She said that “I went to the doctor and he put radiation

158
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:24,478
and they found I was pregnant

159
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:27,314
so what should I do about the baby?”

160
00:15:27,515 --> 00:15:30,947
For such a small thing they will ask.

161
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:35,166
“What should the name of our son?” “What is this?” “What is that?”

162
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:40,867
I mean, I have to do much more work than any priest has to do.

163
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:45,565
Little, little things they are worried about.

164
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:52,737
All right, that part is all right that I have to tell you

165
00:15:52,938 --> 00:15:56,456
what is to be done at such a point or what should we do.

166
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:58,706
If they miss the train, they will telephone to Me,

167
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:02,347
“Mother, we have missed the train. Now what to do?”

168
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:06,285
So I have to tell them, “All right, give them a bandhan.”

169
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:08,808
That also I have to tell them.

170
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,386
Or supposing their father is sick.

171
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:17,135
He has a heart trouble then they’ll telephone to Me,

172
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:19,963
“Mother, my father is sick. He has a heart trouble.

173
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:24,166
He’s not a Sahaja yogi. What can You do about it?”

174
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:27,090
So Mother has to put attention to his father

175
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,742
who is not a Sahaja yogi.

176
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:35,150
Small, small things they write to Me.

177
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:39,322
Such small things that you can’t imagine

178
00:16:39,523 --> 00:16:46,601
how they do not understand what I am here for.

179
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:52,803
Still, I have never said that it’s a stupid thing to ask Me.

180
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:57,264
You should not waste My time, never.

181
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:00,553
But it’s to be seen now

182
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:07,240
that if you do not value yourself as realized souls,

183
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:15,521
you can not value My time also or what is Myself.

184
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:20,146
This incarnation can be wasted completely

185
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:26,261
because of this materialistic attitude.

186
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:31,912
In these modern times, I don’t know what's gone wrong

187
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:37,381
with human beings because the most important thing

188
00:17:37,582 --> 00:17:42,279
in your life is to ascend and to grow.

189
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,357
Take a big vision of the whole thing.

190
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,435
Why this universe was created?

191
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:55,740
Why you were created as human beings?

192
00:17:55,941 --> 00:18:00,896
What was the need to do all these things? For what is it done?

193
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:05,013
If you have a very big vision of the whole thing

194
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:08,857
then try to locate your position. “Where am I?

195
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:12,068
And then, “How the Divine has selected me

196
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:17,104
and now I have become a Sahaja yogi?”

197
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:24,316
So now, “What is my responsibility?” that one has to see.

198
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:27,599
But on the contrary,

199
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,177
I have seen people who are saying have a transfer.

200
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:39,247
So they’ll telephone and ask, “Mother, should we take our chair or not?”

201
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:43,294
That shows they have no value about themselves

202
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:47,435
and no value about Me, both ways.

203
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:50,544
Because they are asking such small things,

204
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:54,733
such silly things that is impossible to understand

205
00:18:54,934 --> 00:19:01,394
how could Sahaja yogis ask such questions.

206
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:14,788
In the perspective we can see, the Goddess.

207
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:21,835
She comes on this earth in different forms at different times

208
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:26,577
to save the seekers of truth

209
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:31,999
and to work out the ascent of the seekers of truth.

210
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,718
Can you imagine?

211
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,929
A very big difference in the incarnation

212
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:45,562
of the Goddess before Kali Yuga.

213
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:50,984
While now, it's a very different thing

214
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:57,906
that you have come on this earth to become the Sahaja yogis.

215
00:19:58,107 --> 00:20:03,398
You have to have a body, a mind, feeling,

216
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,421
everything which is just charged with spirituality,

217
00:20:08,622 --> 00:20:14,882
charged with your spirituality. Should be normally

218
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:20,708
because how many years in the past you have been seeking God.

219
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:26,960
Then, that you came here. What a coincidence!

220
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:34,866
But, when, what is it? When you have such a great advantage

221
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:40,414
that you have come to Sahaja Yoga because of your seeking

222
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:45,766
and now you have found the satisfaction out of it.

223
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:53,342
What is the responsibility that you have?

224
00:20:56,427 --> 00:21:00,468
That the incarnation Itself has come on this earth,

225
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:07,234
not only to protect you, to nourish you, and to kill the demons. No,

226
00:21:07,435 --> 00:21:12,242
She has come on this earth to tell you about everything

227
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:16,672
that is subtler inside

228
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:20,399
and to tell you what should be your relationship:

229
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,180
should be outside as well as inside.

230
00:21:25,381 --> 00:21:27,546
You were never connected with truth.

231
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:31,335
You were never connected with this all-pervading power.

232
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:38,200
You were never connected with God Almighty.

233
00:21:39,106 --> 00:21:41,894
So one has to understand that

234
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:46,860
“What a great thing has happened that out of me only,

235
00:21:47,061 --> 00:21:49,454
this kundalini has come out

236
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:58,137
and she has touched these higher centers.”

237
00:21:58,338 --> 00:22:02,590
How? This was not done before, no.

238
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:07,481
They were just protected. They were just looked after.

239
00:22:07,682 --> 00:22:09,622
Nowhere it is written that

240
00:22:09,823 --> 00:22:15,369
“Goddess has given realization to people,” nowhere.

241
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:19,479
She is responsible. She can give. One of Her names is that.

242
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:25,432
Not one but at least ten names are that She gives you your nirvana,

243
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,940
that She gives you your freedom,

244
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:31,518
that She introduces you to liberty.

245
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:39,499
All these things are written but what's happening now is that

246
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,608
people have not yet been able to grasp

247
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:50,441
the value of their life in the modern time.

248
00:22:51,575 --> 00:22:54,827
See the way people ask questions.

249
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:57,866
See the way people, the inquiry is on,

250
00:22:58,067 --> 00:23:01,889
the way people are worried, “Now my child is big.

251
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,178
What should I do?” What should you do?

252
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:07,944
Child is big. Put him to school. Do what you like.

253
00:23:08,145 --> 00:23:12,913
“Mother, will you please tell where to put the child.”

254
00:23:13,114 --> 00:23:15,827
Then you put the child. “Have you seen the school, Mother?”

255
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:19,085
“No, I haven’t.” “Then you go and inspect the school.”

256
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:23,538
Imagine Kali Mata doing that!

257
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:27,858
She would have given two nice tight slaps, I tell you.

258
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:32,983
Anybody who would have said that, what do you make out of it?

259
00:23:33,184 --> 00:23:38,475
But to that detailed extent a Motherhood has to work out.

260
00:23:38,676 --> 00:23:42,975
You wouldn’t do that for your own child, I know.

261
00:23:43,176 --> 00:23:49,215
But when it comes to children, what are they doing?

262
00:23:49,574 --> 00:23:53,144
Still materialistic.

263
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:59,475
Today specially it’s a very great day of Dusshera, they call it.

264
00:23:59,676 --> 00:24:05,178
This is the day when, as you know, Ravana was burnt.

265
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:09,436
Effigies of Ravanas are burnt all over the place.

266
00:24:09,637 --> 00:24:15,475
When Shri Rama came this was done, His victory.

267
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:19,647
But in His victory, it was not that He made Sahaja yogis

268
00:24:19,848 --> 00:24:23,475
or He gave realization, no.

269
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:28,467
His victory was that He killed Ravana.

270
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:33,897
That was done that time for today’s preparation.

271
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:40,670
For today’s happening, it was done long time back

272
00:24:40,871 --> 00:24:47,169
that these days will come

273
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:52,271
when people will have proper value system

274
00:24:52,472 --> 00:24:57,013
of victory of Shri Rama.

275
00:24:57,214 --> 00:25:01,237
But it doesn’t happen.

276
00:25:02,956 --> 00:25:07,122
It doesn’t happen because this incarnation

277
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:11,927
of Mataji Nirmala Devi is very different, very illusive,

278
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:15,615
Mahamaya.

279
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:20,303
So you are left to yourself, do what you like.

280
00:25:20,504 --> 00:25:23,428
Whatever you like, you can do it.

281
00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:28,396
So they will ask Me, “Mother, we have a problem.”

282
00:25:28,597 --> 00:25:34,912
I said, “What?” “We don’t know which kind of chairs we should buy.”

283
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:38,889
For every small thing they will refer to Mother

284
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,327
but for important things, never.

285
00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:45,186
Sort of a funny use of the whole thing

286
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:48,467
has started which is so great,

287
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:55,014
so important is used for something absolutely nonsensical.

288
00:25:55,215 --> 00:25:58,741
So see the difference between the incarnations.

289
00:25:58,942 --> 00:26:03,491
One incarnation comes on this earth to save the people,

290
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:09,152
to bring them out of the mire of maya.

291
00:26:09,825 --> 00:26:14,483
But another incarnation which has come

292
00:26:14,684 --> 00:26:18,944
is not only just to talk about it

293
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:21,358
but to give you your realization

294
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:26,684
and then to look after your small, small things.

295
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:29,940
So when this lady telephoned and asked Me,

296
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:35,570
“What should I do? Please Mother, cure me.”

297
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:38,893
It's very different attitude.

298
00:26:39,094 --> 00:26:42,987
Between the bhaktas of those days and the bhaktas of today,

299
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:45,760
there's a very big difference.

300
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:50,073
I said, “You never asked Me when you did all that,

301
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:52,878
doesn’t matter. Now whatever you have done,

302
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,714
it's better I see the child, look after the child,

303
00:26:55,915 --> 00:27:02,071
put the child right everything but you come along.”

304
00:27:03,976 --> 00:27:09,157
But then I realized this woman is so attached to her child.

305
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:11,824
And I telephoned to the leader and he said,

306
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:16,306
“It's terrible attachment.

307
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:21,332
It’s a terrible attachment to the child.”

308
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:27,160
So now from one nonsense to another nonsense.

309
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:34,426
This incarnation has such variety of jobs to be done.

310
00:27:34,627 --> 00:27:38,464
I mean, even the sixty-four kalas,

311
00:27:38,665 --> 00:27:42,964
the sixty-four expertise of Shri Ganesh

312
00:27:43,165 --> 00:27:48,055
is not sufficient to solve this.

313
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:53,165
Why is it so complicated?

314
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:56,214
After giving Self-realization,

315
00:27:56,415 --> 00:28:01,378
it should be a straight forward march towards your goal

316
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:05,610
and towards your growth.

317
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:10,363
But why is it that such a complicated nonsense

318
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:14,595
is all the time bothering you?

319
00:28:16,783 --> 00:28:20,910
What do you want now? We should ask, “What do you want?”

320
00:28:21,111 --> 00:28:23,887
“I want a child.”

321
00:28:24,088 --> 00:28:27,817
After Sahaja Yoga, you should not want anything.

322
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:31,778
Why do you want to have a child? There are so many children.

323
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:35,775
You can look after them.

324
00:28:37,768 --> 00:28:42,973
“I want” goes away, should go away from your mind

325
00:28:43,174 --> 00:28:48,174
that “I want this and I want that.”

326
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:53,236
This wanting is over now,

327
00:28:53,437 --> 00:28:57,624
what you wanted – your Self-realization.

328
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:01,276
After that, what has happened is now

329
00:29:01,477 --> 00:29:06,094
what I want is more important.

330
00:29:06,532 --> 00:29:09,972
And I want that you should become really detached

331
00:29:10,173 --> 00:29:12,644
from materialism.

332
00:29:12,845 --> 00:29:15,652
That doesn’t mean that you should become like

333
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:20,832
Hare Rama Hare Krishna no, no, no, no. They are not detached.

334
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:23,027
They are very much attached people.

335
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:28,535
But detachment is a state where nothing can bind you,

336
00:29:28,736 --> 00:29:30,918
nothing is important,

337
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,246
most important thing is your spiritual ascent.

338
00:29:35,447 --> 00:29:41,777
Nothing can attract you more than this process.

339
00:29:41,978 --> 00:29:47,808
This is what exactly is wanted today,

340
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:52,417
that Sahaja yogis should understand.

341
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:56,767
Compared to what Sahaja yogi … compared to Sahaja yogis,

342
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:59,259
what people have gone through.

343
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,712
When I read it, I feel terrible.

344
00:30:03,913 --> 00:30:08,155
Here everything is convenience, convenient,

345
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:11,671
come along, enjoy nice food, nice company,

346
00:30:11,872 --> 00:30:15,226
it’s a festival going on.

347
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:19,976
Everything is properly done. And if something is missing,

348
00:30:20,177 --> 00:30:23,201
I’ll be the one who’ll tell the organizers, “What is this?

349
00:30:23,402 --> 00:30:28,073
You should have done this. You should have done that.”

350
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:44,124
Now, we come to a point where we have to understand,

351
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:48,348
what do we want?

352
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:54,023
What's the use of killing Shumbha Nishumbhas?

353
00:30:54,224 --> 00:30:59,000
What's the use of killing this Catholic Church? What's the use?

354
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:02,844
Because you are static.

355
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:06,867
You are glued in one place, no progress.

356
00:31:07,068 --> 00:31:10,492
So what's the use of doing all these things all the time

357
00:31:10,693 --> 00:31:15,653
and destroying all that negativity.

358
00:31:16,404 --> 00:31:20,122
What is the purpose?

359
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,195
It's too arbitrary. Everybody says,

360
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:25,601
“Mother, you have given them permission.

361
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,695
You have given them license.

362
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:30,758
So now they are doing the way they are.”

363
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:34,805
The other day, one girl came to Me. Her child was very sick.

364
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:39,849
I asked her, “Do you meditate?” She kept quiet.

365
00:31:40,186 --> 00:31:42,626
I said that “I can make out that you don’t meditate

366
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:46,064
because I know what it is –

367
00:31:46,265 --> 00:31:50,444
that you don’t even meditate.”

368
00:31:51,374 --> 00:31:55,923
So today’s main thing is this is a Dusshera day

369
00:31:56,124 --> 00:32:00,454
when the people go, cross the boundaries of their villages

370
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:05,556
and bring gold for the parents.

371
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,290
That’s the story, it is like that.

372
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:14,220
Now what you have to do is to cross the limits of this materialism,

373
00:32:14,421 --> 00:32:21,384
this nonsensical dwarfy force that is working on you

374
00:32:21,585 --> 00:32:29,337
and you have to transcend and bring, as I said, gold,

375
00:32:29,538 --> 00:32:38,111
that is untarnishable thing from the borders of Sahaja Yoga.

376
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:45,816
How many of you really are in the field of work?

377
00:32:46,017 --> 00:32:51,097
How many of you are telling about this to people?

378
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:56,626
What are you doing about it?

379
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:06,889
Why I’m talking to you and not to Indians this way

380
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:12,350
because their attitude is different.

381
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:16,928
Their attitude is not materialistic. It's spiritual.

382
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:22,803
They want their spiritual ascent for which they suffer a lot.

383
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:29,514
They’ll go out of the way to do things just to

384
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:35,748
get to that state where they could be easily surrendered.

385
00:33:35,949 --> 00:33:39,365
This surrender state has to come.

386
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:44,222
For example, you have a problem.

387
00:33:44,996 --> 00:33:48,445
Say problem, you have no holidays

388
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:53,109
and you want to come for pujas, say. I’m just giving example.

389
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:59,164
Now, if you want to come to puja, you just come.

390
00:33:59,365 --> 00:34:04,414
Not only you’ll get job but you might get promotion.

391
00:34:04,615 --> 00:34:11,281
But you have no faith in your ascent. You have no faith

392
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,492
that you are the chosen one.

393
00:34:14,693 --> 00:34:20,794
This is what is missing because of materialism.

394
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:25,453
Recently in America,

395
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:29,883
we have a very great Sahaja yogi, Dave Dunphy.

396
00:34:30,084 --> 00:34:34,399
I told him, “Dave, you better take over as the leader of America

397
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,485
because this gentleman is not all right and you better take over.”

398
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:44,883
Immediately he said, “All right Mother.” Now, he lives in Honolulu.

399
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:51,383
Our programs and everything are done through L.A., Los Angeles,

400
00:34:51,584 --> 00:34:54,672
and it looked quite strange that

401
00:34:54,873 --> 00:35:00,857
I should ask him to come down and work there.

402
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:08,672
Now, where are we? We are the people who have been blessed

403
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,656
with all the powers.

404
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:15,851
You have been blessed. But we don’t want to practice.

405
00:35:16,052 --> 00:35:18,468
We don’t want to find out what powers we have,

406
00:35:18,669 --> 00:35:22,163
worried about our own children, worried about what sari

407
00:35:22,364 --> 00:35:26,710
we are going to wear, or worried about who is the leader

408
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:31,887
and what should we do about the leadership.

409
00:35:34,544 --> 00:35:37,538
All these things are not going to help us.

410
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:41,968
You are not here for that. Try to understand.

411
00:35:42,169 --> 00:35:45,906
You are here for becoming the spirit

412
00:35:46,107 --> 00:35:50,929
and then to spread the light of the spirit.

413
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:54,093
Nothing matters.

414
00:35:54,294 --> 00:35:59,710
Once you start doing that, you'll be amazed, the faith works.

415
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:03,967
It's not blind faith. It's not blind faith.

416
00:36:04,168 --> 00:36:07,835
You don’t have to tell Me even.

417
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:12,371
It just works.

418
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:20,530
It’s a matter of few days,

419
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:27,710
you might get many results

420
00:36:27,911 --> 00:36:31,624
of what you have been hankering after,

421
00:36:31,825 --> 00:36:36,694
material, superficials, you might get.

422
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:41,480
But the question remains.

423
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:49,924
Somebody, say, wants to dedicate his life, so called,

424
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:54,600
for Sahaja Yoga. Then what do you do?

425
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:58,151
What do you do if you dedicate?

426
00:36:58,352 --> 00:37:02,432
First thing is your faith.

427
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:08,080
You must know: how is your faith into anything.

428
00:37:08,281 --> 00:37:13,643
You really believe in it or you do not? If you do believe in it,

429
00:37:13,844 --> 00:37:17,836
what have you done about it?

430
00:37:19,547 --> 00:37:25,382
So at this stage, you have to introspect.

431
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:31,549
What are you doing? What are we to do?

432
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:38,385
How far do we have to go? It’s a very, very important time

433
00:37:38,586 --> 00:37:45,135
and you are extremely important souls here sitting down

434
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:52,698
but if you don’t value your own systems and yourself,

435
00:37:52,899 --> 00:37:57,688
why should God worry about you?

436
00:37:58,672 --> 00:38:02,244
Why should God try to give you ideas?

437
00:38:02,445 --> 00:38:07,051
Why should He try to take any interest even in you –

438
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:12,103
persons of that kind.

439
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:20,379
So now, I have to just tell you that on this day of this Puja,

440
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:24,832
it's such a combination that is the Dusshera, I am here,

441
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:28,566
and also is the now we can call it, the last day

442
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:33,467
of the Devi Puja. We have to see within ourselves,

443
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:39,386
introspect, “What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?”

444
00:38:42,823 --> 00:38:47,309
Except for looking after my children, cooking for the husband,

445
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:50,783
that’s all.

446
00:38:51,323 --> 00:38:55,958
Men can also think the same way, “What have we done?

447
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,005
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?”

448
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:04,911
Just, I want to meet politicians,

449
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:10,591
I want to meet this person, I want to meet that person. For what?

450
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:12,997
They should come and meet

451
00:39:13,198 --> 00:39:16,075
you but your faith in yourself is very weak.

452
00:39:16,276 --> 00:39:23,677
I think that’s the main reason for all this fall is faith in yourself.

453
00:39:23,878 --> 00:39:31,474
This faith is

454
00:39:31,675 --> 00:39:39,589
such a thing that you know it is so.

455
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:44,777
You have seen My photographs. You are convinced about it.

456
00:39:44,978 --> 00:39:46,894
There is nothing to be convinced

457
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:50,878
but this faith is not one with your heart.

458
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:58,198
It is not just with your being. It's outside.

459
00:39:58,399 --> 00:40:04,680
All right, Mother will do that. Mother will solve this. Mother will do this.

460
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:09,807
But,

461
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:14,745
whole thing is now to Me, looks like,

462
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:19,307
that I have to compulsorily tell you

463
00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:23,867
to do some sort of a tapasya.

464
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:31,721
You ask somebody, “Do you meditate?” “No Mother,”

465
00:40:31,922 --> 00:40:36,534
very plainly. “No Mother, we don’t.”

466
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:39,487
“So, what are you doing here?”

467
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:45,229
“My, there’s some pain in my knees so I have come to you.”

468
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:50,729
All right. “But I don’t meditate. I am very honest. I don’t meditate.

469
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:57,039
I just have some pain in the knees. Please cure it. I don’t meditate.”

470
00:40:58,516 --> 00:41:04,547
How many of you really meditate every night?

471
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,292
Guido said that “Mother, if You tell like this they will say,

472
00:41:08,493 --> 00:41:11,269
“All right in the night we do but not in the morning”

473
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:15,574
because Mother has said, “Do it in the night.”

474
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:24,011
There’s no earnestness. There’s no

475
00:41:24,212 --> 00:41:31,324
expected any kind of a enthusiasm about it.

476
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:34,621
All right, if not today, we will see tomorrow.

477
00:41:34,822 --> 00:41:38,317
Mother says like that “It's not necessary.

478
00:41:38,518 --> 00:41:42,536
It's not important. It's all right.”

479
00:41:42,737 --> 00:41:45,677
So you satisfy yourself.

480
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:50,325
But who is the loser? Not Me. I don’t need Sahaja Yoga,

481
00:41:50,526 --> 00:41:52,341
do I?

482
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:56,146
I am doing all the tapasya for your Sahaja Yoga.

483
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:02,862
What about you people doing some tapasya about it?

484
00:42:04,003 --> 00:42:06,888
So now, what I am trying to say

485
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:09,615
that you have got your realization.

486
00:42:09,816 --> 00:42:13,365
Now you have reached a great state of understanding,

487
00:42:13,566 --> 00:42:17,818
also of the inner knowledge and also about

488
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:23,256
your connection with the spirit and with the God Almighty.

489
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,975
All this you know now. Many things you know.

490
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:33,904
Despite that, it's not yet what it should be from your heart,

491
00:42:34,105 --> 00:42:40,777
from your earnest desire.

492
00:42:42,574 --> 00:42:53,673
It doesn’t help at all any one to deceive oneself, never.

493
00:42:53,874 --> 00:42:59,525
So I am not saying something for x, y, z. I am saying for all of you.

494
00:42:59,726 --> 00:43:05,038
Don’t try to cheat yourself.

495
00:43:05,622 --> 00:43:12,038
You are here with such a great purpose.

496
00:43:12,734 --> 00:43:21,714
This purpose is corrective and is the freedom of our minds

497
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:25,456
from all these nonsensical destructive forces

498
00:43:25,657 --> 00:43:32,258
and then to spread it all over, talk about it.

499
00:43:34,035 --> 00:43:41,506
My own conviction is this,

500
00:43:41,707 --> 00:43:46,576
that something has to happen to Sahaja yogis

501
00:43:46,777 --> 00:43:57,958
to realize how important it is to work out

502
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,462
something that is within us, which is potential,

503
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:05,353
which is just about to bubble up.

504
00:44:05,554 --> 00:44:09,681
It’s a responsibility, whether you are a Jew, a Christian

505
00:44:09,882 --> 00:44:14,673
or anything makes no difference. It is all outside.

506
00:44:14,874 --> 00:44:18,314
For what you have to do that you have come into

507
00:44:18,515 --> 00:44:24,103
a new realm of awareness, into a new realm of a higher life

508
00:44:24,304 --> 00:44:26,572
where you know all your inner self,

509
00:44:26,773 --> 00:44:30,877
you know all about what is good and what is not.

510
00:44:31,078 --> 00:44:35,627
Everything after knowing all this also if you do not grow

511
00:44:35,828 --> 00:44:40,101
then whom will you blame?

512
00:44:44,602 --> 00:44:49,823
So now we come to a point to understand

513
00:44:50,024 --> 00:44:52,932
the importance of this Kali Yuga,

514
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:56,745
where your Mother is here to help you

515
00:44:56,946 --> 00:45:04,072
and also to look after you very tenderly, sweetly,

516
00:45:04,273 --> 00:45:07,400
to tell you everything.

517
00:45:07,601 --> 00:45:14,866
Actually I cannot get angry with any one for more than one minute.

518
00:45:16,056 --> 00:45:22,806
So, explain to you sweetly what you should have done

519
00:45:23,007 --> 00:45:26,822
and which you can do, which you have to do.

520
00:45:27,023 --> 00:45:29,845
All these things I would have really

521
00:45:30,046 --> 00:45:33,439
would have been telling you all the time. I have been

522
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:38,041
bringing you round very sweetly and explaining to you

523
00:45:38,242 --> 00:45:42,087
and telling you that this is your own power which is within you

524
00:45:42,288 --> 00:45:46,087
and which you have to look after and raise it

525
00:45:46,288 --> 00:45:53,345
and also you have got so many books or ways of understanding that.

526
00:45:53,546 --> 00:45:58,853
But this inner knowledge which you have is something like this –

527
00:45:59,054 --> 00:46:04,712
that I have a inner knowledge about, say about,

528
00:46:04,913 --> 00:46:09,610
how to build these things but I don’t do it.

529
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:13,119
Is as simple as that. I just don’t do it.

530
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:19,163
I have the inner knowledge, all right. I have a Ph.D. but I am mad.

531
00:46:20,258 --> 00:46:23,476
It's like that.

532
00:46:23,946 --> 00:46:28,237
So many people mentally very well equipped in Sahaja Yoga, I know.

533
00:46:28,438 --> 00:46:32,370
But as far as the following of Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

534
00:46:32,571 --> 00:46:35,401
they are not there.

535
00:46:35,602 --> 00:46:40,409
So I am warning you now. It's like Christ has said,

536
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:46,057
“Some seeds which are sprouted fell on the street and dried out and died.”

537
00:46:46,258 --> 00:46:48,041
Now the judgment is going on all the time.

538
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:53,479
When I am talking to you, it's all the judgment is going on.

539
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,877
So every night you have to meditate.

540
00:46:57,078 --> 00:47:03,971
And you have to then think about what have you done tonight,

541
00:47:04,172 --> 00:47:10,125
today, in the whole day what have you achieved.

542
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:13,737
But so calculating they are.

543
00:47:13,938 --> 00:47:17,276
Supposing I go there at five o’clock

544
00:47:17,477 --> 00:47:22,878
then I have to be back at seven otherwise I will miss the point,

545
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:26,566
I’ll not see this person, that person.

546
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:32,777
So, everything works like that with the time,

547
00:47:32,978 --> 00:47:36,035
with the importance of nonsensical things.

548
00:47:36,236 --> 00:47:41,668
But what has to work is your faith

549
00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:45,082
that “I’m going to do things which are truthful,

550
00:47:45,283 --> 00:47:48,246
which are sensible, down to earth

551
00:47:48,447 --> 00:47:55,980
and I’m going to keep myself absolutely, extremely free

552
00:47:56,181 --> 00:48:02,957
and I’m going to look after not only my inner being

553
00:48:03,158 --> 00:48:06,801
but the inner beings of others.”

554
00:48:07,002 --> 00:48:13,418
Today’s special puja is really of, more of right side I would say.

555
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:16,027
Dusshera is a right side Puja

556
00:48:16,228 --> 00:48:22,642
because you worship Shri Rama and his bow and everything.

557
00:48:23,189 --> 00:48:26,933
But think of these incarnation.

558
00:48:27,134 --> 00:48:29,511
Fourteen years He went to jail.

559
00:48:29,712 --> 00:48:34,675
For a particular reason, He went there.

560
00:48:34,876 --> 00:48:39,566
I mean, if somebody has to go even for one year, it’s a headache.

561
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:44,409
It's not a jail but it's, we can call, in the forest that He went,

562
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:47,675
it was like a jail to Him.

563
00:48:47,876 --> 00:48:51,863
He was a king’s son. He had no place to live, to sleep.

564
00:48:52,064 --> 00:48:55,480
Everywhere He went, He had to build His own little hut.

565
00:48:55,681 --> 00:48:58,371
So He went there.

566
00:48:58,572 --> 00:49:03,738
He had to do it. Why, why did He do it?

567
00:49:03,939 --> 00:49:08,293
Because He had faith in Himself. He is Shri Rama

568
00:49:08,494 --> 00:49:12,816
and He has to jolly well do these things. He had faith in Himself.

569
00:49:13,017 --> 00:49:16,527
And He had faith in God Almighty that whatever He’s doing,

570
00:49:16,728 --> 00:49:20,840
He is doing as a will of God.

571
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:24,340
And that is what I have to do, finished.

572
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:28,121
I don’t care whether I have to face Ravana

573
00:49:28,322 --> 00:49:32,816
or I have to face this or that, I don’t care.

574
00:49:33,017 --> 00:49:37,981
I am a Sahaja yogi. I don’t care.

575
00:49:38,182 --> 00:49:42,106
My job is to spread Sahaja Yoga, all right.

576
00:49:42,307 --> 00:49:47,754
My job is to cleanse myself up and know myself.

577
00:49:47,955 --> 00:49:51,207
This is my work, my job, and this is what I have to do.

578
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:55,746
I am not bothered if I get admission in the school or not.

579
00:49:55,947 --> 00:49:59,590
I am not bothered if somebody has to go by plane,

580
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:02,653
so he gets a ticket or not.

581
00:50:02,854 --> 00:50:06,989
You just won’t believe that you show your faith in yourself,

582
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:11,262
you'll get the admission, you'll get the ticket,

583
00:50:11,463 --> 00:50:16,575
whatever you want is there. It's all there.

584
00:50:16,776 --> 00:50:19,630
You don’t have to strive for it.

585
00:50:19,831 --> 00:50:25,349
You don’t have to bother for it. It's just there.

586
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:29,341
It is. I mean, all My life it has been happening.

587
00:50:29,542 --> 00:50:35,880
Of course My faith is, is like solid, like Gibraltar, no question.

588
00:50:36,081 --> 00:50:39,950
Because I know what I am and I know what I am supposed to do.

589
00:50:40,151 --> 00:50:43,325
So My, for Me I have no problem.

590
00:50:43,526 --> 00:50:47,458
All the faith and I know everyone and I can say that

591
00:50:47,659 --> 00:50:52,073
I can make out a flying bird.

592
00:50:52,714 --> 00:50:55,243
May not show that. Sometimes I may say that

593
00:50:55,444 --> 00:50:57,235
“All right this is good, this that”

594
00:50:57,436 --> 00:51:02,719
but I know for definite what I am and what I have to do.

595
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,117
In the same way, you have to know about yourself

596
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:09,672
because it’s a different category of people you are.

597
00:51:09,873 --> 00:51:12,891
You are not the ones who need protection from God,

598
00:51:13,092 --> 00:51:18,258
who need protection from the Mother, no.

599
00:51:18,459 --> 00:51:21,711
You have to give protections to others.

600
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,438
It is you have to give light to others.

601
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:26,860
You have to show them the path.

602
00:51:27,061 --> 00:51:33,024
So you are here for that purpose not for getting a house

603
00:51:33,225 --> 00:51:37,821
or a, what you call, income tax concession.

604
00:51:38,022 --> 00:51:40,594
You are not that for.

605
00:51:40,795 --> 00:51:43,219
All that nonsense you forget.

606
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:47,336
Jolly well, they'll have to give you concession.

607
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,625
I, I, I live like that, absolutely.

608
00:51:50,826 --> 00:51:53,188
I’m not bothered when I am traveling,

609
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:56,911
whether there's a ticket or not, whether there is, what you call,

610
00:51:57,112 --> 00:52:00,599
a seat or not. I’m not bothered.

611
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,380
I’m not bothered at all.

612
00:52:03,581 --> 00:52:07,338
All right I am traveling. I don’t even think I am traveling.

613
00:52:07,604 --> 00:52:12,455
I just think that I’m there. That’s all.

614
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:15,489
So many things I say

615
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:19,427
which looks so bombastic and looks so ego oriented,

616
00:52:19,628 --> 00:52:24,786
like I said that “This Catholic Church is about to finish.”

617
00:52:24,987 --> 00:52:27,231
I said that.

618
00:52:27,432 --> 00:52:35,072
If it was someone else they'll say, “Perhaps, maybe.”

619
00:52:39,626 --> 00:52:45,534
Now, so one has to change one's own language,

620
00:52:45,735 --> 00:52:52,386
the style and our understanding should be

621
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:55,667
that we are a rough people.

622
00:52:55,868 --> 00:52:59,808
We are rough as far as ourselves are concerned.

623
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:04,527
With others we are kind, tender, and sweet.

624
00:53:04,728 --> 00:53:09,058
But as far as we are concerned, we are not.

625
00:53:09,259 --> 00:53:12,824
Once it happened, we had a transfer

626
00:53:13,025 --> 00:53:16,019
and we went into a house, very big house though,

627
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,308
but there was nothing to sleep upon. Or there was one bed,

628
00:53:19,509 --> 00:53:23,230
quite small. My husband was sleeping. He just can’t do like that.

629
00:53:23,431 --> 00:53:26,238
I said, “All right, take a challenge.” I slept on the ground.

630
00:53:26,439 --> 00:53:29,535
Next day, I had pain in the body.

631
00:53:29,736 --> 00:53:32,941
I told My body, “Behave yourself.

632
00:53:33,142 --> 00:53:36,136
Must learn how to sleep on stones also.”

633
00:53:36,337 --> 00:53:41,230
And for one month I was sleeping on the ground, still.

634
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:43,683
So you have to be harsh with your body.

635
00:53:43,884 --> 00:53:46,782
You have to be harsh with your mind which gives you ideas

636
00:53:46,983 --> 00:53:52,751
of materialism or of retarding your progress in spirituality.

637
00:53:52,952 --> 00:53:56,587
Now, escapes, escapes they find out.

638
00:53:56,788 --> 00:54:00,298
Ultimately, you come to the last point

639
00:54:00,499 --> 00:54:04,493
where you do not think about, say, material life

640
00:54:04,694 --> 00:54:07,141
and you don’t think of mental life

641
00:54:07,342 --> 00:54:10,266
or so called these spiritual lives or anything

642
00:54:10,467 --> 00:54:13,711
but you think that it's all right, you are free from it

643
00:54:13,912 --> 00:54:18,195
and now you have become a very, very free person

644
00:54:18,396 --> 00:54:22,453
and you can do what you like. Supposing you reach a state like that,

645
00:54:22,654 --> 00:54:29,857
then you just say, “Oh, I’ve reached that state, finished.”

646
00:54:30,428 --> 00:54:33,416
How are we to believe?

647
00:54:33,617 --> 00:54:40,187
What’s the proof that you have reached that state?

648
00:54:40,742 --> 00:54:46,408
You must show. Doesn’t show but they say, “Ah, we are.”

649
00:54:46,609 --> 00:54:49,611
There’s a myth also in Sahaja Yoga that senior,

650
00:54:49,812 --> 00:54:54,525
he is a very senior Sahaja yogi. I mean, I don’t understand.

651
00:54:54,733 --> 00:54:58,908
What is this? How can there be seniority in Sahaja Yoga?

652
00:54:59,109 --> 00:55:03,484
Cannot be seniority. No question.

653
00:55:03,906 --> 00:55:08,057
Somebody is say, enters into the sea.

654
00:55:08,258 --> 00:55:14,362
Some are there for ages standing near the edge of the sea

655
00:55:14,563 --> 00:55:18,151
holding on to the earth because they are afraid to swim

656
00:55:18,352 --> 00:55:21,604
and some people who have come only yesterday might be jumping

657
00:55:21,805 --> 00:55:28,502
and going ahead and doing, enjoying the sea.

658
00:55:28,703 --> 00:55:31,403
So how is it he is the senior, he is the ...

659
00:55:31,604 --> 00:55:37,275
We do not have this seniority business in Sahaja yoga.

660
00:55:37,651 --> 00:55:40,919
There’s no seniority. And there’s also another myth.

661
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,880
Maybe this is an excuse. I don’t know what to say

662
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:46,341
but it is a very common thing to say

663
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:49,529
that he is a senior Sahaja yogi or he is a,

664
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:54,745
after all he is a senior Sahaja yogi.

665
00:55:55,605 --> 00:55:58,521
Can’t understand. Like saying a donkey,

666
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:03,886
“This donkey is senior. Another donkey is not.”

667
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:12,215
Then another thing that you suffer from very much,

668
00:56:12,424 --> 00:56:16,957
very common is this

669
00:56:17,158 --> 00:56:21,306
that “Mother said so.”

670
00:56:21,596 --> 00:56:27,856
Anybody will say, “Oh, Mother said to me, She called me and She said it.”

671
00:56:28,057 --> 00:56:31,176
“What did She say?” “Oh you are a very great Sahaja yogi.

672
00:56:31,377 --> 00:56:36,098
You are this. You are that. You are that.”

673
00:56:36,299 --> 00:56:39,332
Now there are two possibilities.

674
00:56:39,533 --> 00:56:46,298
One, I might have said it just to befool him.

675
00:56:47,546 --> 00:56:51,444
I am Mahamaya.

676
00:56:52,015 --> 00:56:58,142
Or maybe I must have said all this just to see that

677
00:56:58,343 --> 00:57:02,228
pamper his ego so that he gets to Sahaja Yoga

678
00:57:02,429 --> 00:57:08,119
and does something substantial than to eat My head.

679
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,142
So, “Mother said so.” Such a great Sahaja yogi,

680
00:57:12,343 --> 00:57:16,704
I am such and such, very bombastic words,

681
00:57:16,905 --> 00:57:21,631
very bombastic language he would use.

682
00:57:22,288 --> 00:57:27,561
And then people, “Ah, what a Sahaja yogi.”

683
00:57:28,272 --> 00:57:32,798
So the judgment of a Sahaja yogi

684
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:39,077
doesn’t come from what he claims but what he achieves.

685
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:44,970
I have seen some Sahaja yogis are extremely arrogant also.

686
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:49,173
Extremely arrogant, think no end of themselves.

687
00:57:49,374 --> 00:57:54,212
All that is there. So many Sahaja yogis I have seen of that kind,

688
00:57:54,413 --> 00:57:56,907
that they are very, very arrogant

689
00:57:57,108 --> 00:58:00,891
and that they try to make a big show

690
00:58:01,092 --> 00:58:05,219
out of what great people they are.

691
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,563
Humpty Dumpties, as they call it.

692
00:58:07,764 --> 00:58:12,993
All right, but what a Sahaja yogi who is not like that,

693
00:58:13,194 --> 00:58:17,040
what is his style is?

694
00:58:17,264 --> 00:58:20,899
He'll just watch. He will witness the whole thing, just enjoy

695
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,516
and laugh at what is happening.

696
00:58:23,717 --> 00:58:26,219
What is this man talking like this?

697
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:30,078
What’s the sense of his talking like this?

698
00:58:30,279 --> 00:58:36,008
A person who is a Sahaja yogi is a gem.

699
00:58:36,209 --> 00:58:41,672
Is a gem and gem for which you take him to anywhere,

700
00:58:41,873 --> 00:58:48,193
to any place, people will say, “He’s a gem.”

701
00:58:56,013 --> 00:59:05,439
My own style is this that when I see a person

702
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,697
or a Sahaja yogi anywhere,

703
00:59:08,898 --> 00:59:12,260
first thing I go inside Myself,

704
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:14,229
first thing.

705
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:18,096
I don’t know if you can do that. But I can.

706
00:59:18,297 --> 00:59:23,752
And then I see that person in a very different perspective

707
00:59:23,953 --> 00:59:27,432
and understand. Because all these powers are with you also.

708
00:59:27,633 --> 00:59:30,237
It's not My powers only. You all have these powers

709
00:59:30,438 --> 00:59:32,573
but the only difference between you and Me is that

710
00:59:32,774 --> 00:59:38,524
I have all faith in Myself and you have no faith in yourself.

711
00:59:45,241 --> 00:59:50,938
So we are at a crossing roads

712
00:59:51,139 --> 00:59:55,422
where we have to understand who will go higher

713
00:59:55,623 --> 00:59:59,586
and who’ll go lower.

714
00:59:59,787 --> 01:00:04,766
You have to find out who is the one who is going to achieve something

715
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:09,873
and where am I compared to that person.

716
01:00:10,592 --> 01:00:14,073
Is said, “You have to suffer. You have to do this. You have to do that.”

717
01:00:14,274 --> 01:00:20,253
Nothing of the kind, by God’s grace. Nothing of that kind.

718
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:24,469
So now what is it?

719
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:29,691
What will happen to a Sahaja yogi?

720
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:35,058
How will you know who is a Sahaja yogi?

721
01:00:35,259 --> 01:00:42,652
How will you know who is just putting a lip service?

722
01:00:42,853 --> 01:00:48,324
Only way is that you evolve. You become like a mirror

723
01:00:48,525 --> 01:00:53,847
and you see for yourself what sort of a person he is

724
01:00:54,048 --> 01:00:59,690
and also you see yourself, what you are.

725
01:00:59,891 --> 01:01:04,185
Today’s lecture is more, sort of,

726
01:01:04,386 --> 01:01:08,154
is actually absolutely inspired lecture.

727
01:01:08,355 --> 01:01:11,615
And it is the one that should tell you

728
01:01:11,816 --> 01:01:19,453
that all that we have done today is this to understand

729
01:01:19,654 --> 01:01:25,094
our own values about our own life.

730
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:28,899
We should understand, “Why are we on this earth?

731
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:35,193
What is our purpose and what we have to achieve?”

732
01:01:35,873 --> 01:01:42,391
You see, this I give you My all blessings from My heart.

733
01:01:42,592 --> 01:01:50,165
And I want you to accept My blessings,

734
01:01:50,366 --> 01:01:58,795
to be the great lights of God's desire.

735
01:01:58,996 --> 01:02:04,279
Try to understand what important time you are born

736
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:13,840
and that you have  become such good, beautiful people of God.

737
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:19,183
May God bless you!

738
01:02:32,278 --> 01:02:36,629
May God bless you!
