1
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,260
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,180
Can you hear her there – all the way?

3
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:05,220
Or you may use this. Better. I will just speak. All right.

4
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:20,940
I’m very grateful to the Sahaja yogis of Vienna,

5
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,340
who have invited Me to this place,

6
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,780
and this is My first visit to Vienna.

7
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:48,060
This is the last state that I had to touch in Europe

8
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,940
and so I must say, lot of work has been already done

9
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,860
in Sahaja Yoga in other countries.

10
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,940
Somehow it happened that I had to come to Vienna

11
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,340
after such a long time.

12
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,780
I’m really very happy to see there are so many

13
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,220
seekers in Vienna.

14
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,180
And they are the seekers of truth.

15
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:39,060
But first of all, we have to understand what is truth.

16
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,180
Whatever truth we have so far as human beings,

17
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,980
has been known to us through our awareness,

18
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,980
through our central nervous system.

19
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,220
For example, if you see the flowers, the flowers are white;

20
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,500
we can see they are there - this is the truth for us.

21
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,700
I touch this steel and I know it is cold, so I know it

22
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:22,740
is steel and I know it is cold - is a fact with My fingers.

23
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,980
It is not any imagination or a mental projection to think

24
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:36,540
that this is the flute of Shri Krishna.

25
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,380
Because I can see, I can hear and I can feel that I know

26
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,300
this is the truth, because I know through My experiences

27
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,660
of the central nervous system.

28
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,460
In My own awareness as a human being I know

29
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,100
there is fragrance in the flowers.

30
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:20,060
In My own understanding I know the aesthetics of this place.

31
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,260
If you take a horse through a dirty lane,

32
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:33,580
he doesn’t feel the dirt and filth and the smell of that place.

33
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,740
But a human being, when he passes through those lanes,

34
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,420
he knows that it’s dirty, he can’t bear it,

35
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,220
because his awareness is such.

36
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,140
This is the difference of awareness in our evolution

37
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,380
that we have achieved as human beings.

38
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,140
So, one has to know that whatever is going to happen to us

39
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,820
has to happen in our awareness.

40
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,220
That whatever we achieve or whatever we get in our

41
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,900
central nervous system is absolutely logical and

42
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,580
can be experimented with.

43
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,060
That we can verify it.

44
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:48,660
It is not like a dark lane that you move on for years together.

45
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,540
It’s not like a dark lane, dark lane, dark –

46
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,820
but is an enlightened path where you are aware

47
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,420
of the higher capacities of human beings.

48
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,220
What is the higher capacity of a saint?

49
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,980
It is not that the kind of dress he wears or the way

50
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,260
he moves about.

51
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,700
But the higher capacity of a saint is that he is collectively

52
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,740
conscious.

53
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,620
Because he’s connected with the Spirit,

54
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,620
which is a collective being within us.

55
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,220
So that something has to happen in your awareness

56
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,580
that you should become, again I say become -

57
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:08,140
actualize the experience of collective consciousness.

58
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,180
Like Mohammad Sahib has clearly said that,

59
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,980
“In the resurrection time your hands will speak.”

60
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,300
That He said that you can feel in your hands – what hands

61
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,060
are going to speak, there’s not going to be any lips here –

62
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,140
but you are going to feel something in your hands

63
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,580
which is going to speak for you.

64
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,140
Now, when we come to truth,

65
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,500
we have to know about its other alternatives

66
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,100
and the fakeness of it.

67
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,740
Every truth can be faked.

68
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,340
Every flower which is living

69
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,580
can be made into plastic flowers.

70
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,940
And to make plastic flower is very easy,

71
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,620
you can make them by thousands.

72
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:46,060
But the real flowers are rare and are real because

73
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:53,420
they’re actual flowers living on a living force of life.

74
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:07,060
So the evolution is the living process of the living God.

75
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,700
If that is the truth, then we must understand that

76
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,380
whatever has happened to us so far in our evolution

77
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,580
spontaneously, in the same way

78
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,380
something has to happen to us, spontaneously.

79
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,300
Like a seed, if it has to sprout,

80
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,380
you have to put it in the Mother Earth because

81
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,500
She has the quality, She has the authority to germinate it.

82
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,220
Do we pay money to the seed to sprout?

83
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:10,180
How can you pay for God?

84
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,060
I can’t understand the naiveness of the Western people

85
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,300
not to understand that you cannot pay to someone

86
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:25,980
who thinks that he can deliver the spiritual life to you.

87
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,900
These are all parasites,

88
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,700
and if you want to have parasites as your guru,

89
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,460
you go ahead with it.

90
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,220
Nobody can control you in there,

91
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,540
because you have the freedom.

92
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,820
The other school of thought which is revolting against

93
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,940
this kind of fakeness could be that they are all fake,

94
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,500
that’s all falsehood, there’s no truth – that’s also wrong.

95
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,100
So many people who have gone through the

96
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,180
circus of guru-shopping come to end that

97
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,780
we should become communists now.

98
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,260
That is also another extreme.

99
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,620
That’s a denial of the truth.

100
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,580
So it is in the center there is the truth, no doubt about it,

101
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:54,660
but it is not a thing that you can purchase in the market.

102
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,460
Specially in the West people are pampered,

103
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,220
their ego is pampered, if you can pay for something

104
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,700
or you can purchase something,

105
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,980
you can possess something.

106
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,060
But I said, “You cannot pay for God.”

107
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,060
Anybody who takes money in the name of God

108
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,500
and lives upon it is a parasite.

109
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,860
And the one who is a parasite cannot be your guru,

110
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,500
he is much less than you;

111
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,740
you won’t live like a parasite yourself.

112
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,420
And the second point I told you,

113
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,620
when it is a living process within you,

114
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,140
then you must know that you cannot put in any effort.

115
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:26,460
Is a simple thing of a flower becoming a fruit.

116
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,060
Now you jump before it or stand on your head

117
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,980
or take out your clothes or wear any clothes –

118
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,260
will it become the fruit?

119
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,060
How much does it take to jump or to change it or to have

120
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:54,340
some sort of a nude body, how much does it take?

121
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,220
Anybody can do that.

122
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,900
Sahaja Yoga is a path for the true seekers,

123
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,700
and not for the people who run after fake things

124
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,860
and do not want to face it.

125
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,540
It’s a category of people who are men of God,

126
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,620
who are seeking the Truth, and who do not accept

127
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,060
anything that is fake.

128
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:41,220
And is a category of courageous people,

129
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:49,460
the brave people, who can discard all that is a hang-up

130
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,900
or a conditioning on them.

131
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,420
Who can discard, who can give up.

132
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,540
So, God has given you everything.

133
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,220
While making you a human being, in His gentle care,

134
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,660
He has created you a beautiful human being

135
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,340
and all the roots are within you.

136
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:39,300
Now, when you try to put in your effort to find God,

137
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,980
then you are not spontaneous.

138
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,060
It’s all man-made.

139
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:59,820
And in that effort you start moving to the left or to the right.

140
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,940
Tomorrow I will tell you in details about the left side

141
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,540
and the right side, but today I will just tell you that

142
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,980
when you move to the left, you fall into the trap of your

143
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:19,220
subconscious or into the collective subconscious.

144
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,580
In Sanskrit it is called as Adi Bhautik.

145
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,060
Adi Bhautik.

146
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,580
Bhautik.

147
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:50,500
Means it is the collective subconscious within us.

148
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,620
You get drawn into it and you start getting lost and

149
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,540
completely mesmerized and brainwashed.

150
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,060
If you are given an ego trip on the right-hand side,

151
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,740
you can fall a trip to that also.

152
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,340
Human beings accept conditionings very fast.

153
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,060
conditionings

154
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:56,220
There was an experiment with twenty people in England.

155
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,100
They told ten people to behave like prisoners

156
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,420
and ten people to behave like jailers.

157
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,060
They were just told that, “It’s a drama, you have to be

158
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,060
there for a month and we want to see

159
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,260
if there is any change in your behavior.”

160
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,300
And they were told again and again,

161
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:38,540
“It’s an enactment, it’s not reality, it’s just enactment.”

162
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,060
But, when they went into the jail, the jailers became

163
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,580
very arrogant and egoistical, and the prisoners

164
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,860
became absolutely slavish and going through all the

165
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:59,260
hardships which these ego-oriented people poured on them.

166
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,460
Out of the twenty, only one revolted against this

167
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,500
because he was beaten up by these so-called jailers

168
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:29,060
who were acting, actually beaten up.

169
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:39,300
And they came out of the jail and they were surprised

170
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,740
at their own behavior.

171
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,340
The prisoners had become so weak that they were

172
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,780
to be admitted in the hospital for all the tortures

173
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,380
they had to go through.

174
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,740
And the other ten became so ego-oriented, perhaps

175
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,060
they must have joined some political party.

176
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,300
This is the situation of human beings.

177
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,100
Now with all this,

178
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,300
the masters of evil geniuses –

179
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,900
they come as fake gurus.

180
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:45,060
And you are so naive, you play into it.

181
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:56,940
They have in control lots of evil spirits with them.

182
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,540
And they can mesmerize you so well that you’ll do all

183
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:09,620
kinds of stupid things whatever they want you to do.

184
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,180
So they make their money, they have women,

185
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:22,660
they drink, they enjoy the life more than any king or

186
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:28,260
president or any rich man of the world.

187
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:39,140
While the poor disciples are finished with their

188
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:45,980
all wealth, money, health – they look sickly people.

189
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,620
One has to know that when you get your realization,

190
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:57,420
your own powers must manifest.

191
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,820
So that you become collectively conscious and that

192
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,260
you are spirit, manifest the power of that collective

193
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,580
consciousness.

194
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:32,220
Now, the trouble with people is that they are not yet

195
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:39,100
know the knowledge of Kundalini in the real sense.

196
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,340
I have read – I mean, I’ve seen and not read fully –

197
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,580
but I’ve read some of the books written by Germans

198
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,940
and by English and by all Western people,

199
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,180
and I was shocked.

200
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,700
They had no knowledge about Kundalini.

201
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,980
Leave alone the Knowledge –

202
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:20,900
they had no power from the Divine to awaken the Kundalini.

203
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,140
They had no character of a saint, which is required

204
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,260
to raise the Kundalini.

205
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,300
They were ugly slaves of their greed and lust,

206
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,100
and they were using this knowledge

207
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,420
just to make more money.

208
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,660
Now to understand the basic character of Kundalini,

209
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:09,060
one has to know that She is your mother.

210
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,980
I’m told that German people call their motherland as

211
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:31,460
fatherland, but Father is just a spectator of the play.

212
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:45,860
Only His Shakti, His power, the Primordial Mother,

213
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:51,420
the Holy Ghost does all the job to please this spectator

214
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,460
who is sitting alone and watching it.

215
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:11,060
He resides in your heart as spirit.

216
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,180
And the Kundalini is the Holy Ghost

217
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,220
reflected within you.

218
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,100
The nature of the Kundalini is that She’s the pure,

219
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,540
ultimate desire.

220
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,180
This power is called as a residual,

221
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,420
because it has not yet manifested itself.

222
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:03,540
The ultimate desire of every human soul is

223
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,900
to become the spirit.

224
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,980
You may do this, you may do that, you may try

225
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,660
everything – ultimately you will come to the conclusion

226
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:23,580
that, “I have not become the spirit.”

227
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,420
So when you become the spirit, then only

228
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,780
the manifestation of this Kundalini takes place,

229
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,100
Her ascent takes place and She is the one who

230
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:50,140
creates the position of yoga, the union with the Divine.

231
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,620
This is the Yoga.

232
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,260
Also yoga means kaushalam, means the deftness,

233
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:16,980
the deftness, how to handle the Kundalini of others,

234
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:22,060
the whole knowledge of the divine laws and the divine

235
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:30,060
manifestation, is also yoga, is also called kaushalam.

236
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,820
There are all types of yogas these days prevalent,

237
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:41,060
as there are all types of gurus.

238
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,140
Now the physical yoga is another kind of a thing

239
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:56,060
which people think is the ultimate for spiritual life.

240
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,580
This one comes from Patanjali, who lived

241
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,860
thousands of years back in India where we had a

242
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,700
very different system of life.

243
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:20,900
Till the age of twenty-five years, the children lived

244
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:26,060
in the forest with their realized souls as their gurus.

245
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,860
There, celibacy was so preserved and innocence

246
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,380
so respected that a person belonging to the same

247
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,500
university could not marry each other.

248
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:51,620
The same university; the innocence;

249
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,980
that the students of the same university

250
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,340
could not marry.

251
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,940
And these universities were called as gotras.

252
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:18,540
Even today, you cannot marry in the same gotra.

253
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,940
The yama niyama, the vyayama, the one you do

254
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:29,900
the exercise, was only done by people who

255
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:33,980
were not married,

256
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,780
according to the need of a particular center

257
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,580
which was in trouble.

258
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,620
We too use these exercises wherever it is needed.

259
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:01,300
But today’s yoga system which we see is nothing like,

260
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:07,300
nothing but taking the whole box of medicine together.

261
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,340
Without even finding out what is your prakruti, means

262
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,660
what is your temperament, what is the need of your

263
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,380
particular body, where is the Kundalini,

264
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:26,060
what you have to do to open a particular chakra

265
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:30,180
where you are caught up.

266
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:42,260
I mean, nobody has that knowledge at all.

267
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,780
It’s such a mechanical process that has started that

268
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,780
we all want to be of the same size just like

269
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,780
a machine thing.

270
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:02,220
This one is a very dangerous move because it

271
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,060
creates problems for the Kundalini to be awakened.

272
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:16,980
The people who indulge into too much physical attention,

273
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:20,860
and work out too much of physical activities and

274
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,620
mental activities become futuristic people.

275
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:38,740
They become very superficial and dry-tempered.

276
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,300
With such people there’s a possibility of getting

277
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:48,180
people divorced and fighting and quarreling.

278
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,460
The greatest Hatha yogi which I have known in My life

279
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,220
was Hitler.

280
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:08,340
And he used tantrikas from Tibet to get him

281
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,500
the power to control the ego of people.

282
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:25,500
And he made them so violent that they could not see

283
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,340
what they were doing.

284
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:41,580
There are many gurus who do that way today also.

285
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,180
They can make you so violent that you cannot see

286
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,140
what you are doing.

287
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:58,100
Or they can make you just cabbages,

288
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:08,180
so that you lose all your being and become somebody else.

289
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,900
But it is done so well that people who do not know

290
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,580
about the knowledge of Kundalini and spirit

291
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:24,140
can be easily captured.

292
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:36,980
I call the West as the progress of the shoot,

293
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,420
of the outside of the tree.

294
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:51,340
They know science, politics, economics very well.

295
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:58,820
They can create atom bombs to kill themselves.

296
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:04,260
They can create even worse things than that.

297
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,060
They haven’t got the knowledge of the roots on

298
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:11,180
which they are growing.

299
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,820
And the knowledge of the root only can be known

300
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:20,380
when you become the spirit, that’s the beginning.

301
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,180
This is a big disadvantage for the saints who are born

302
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:35,580
on this beautiful side of the earth.

303
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:43,780
So many seekers are born in the West.

304
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,900
As the desire of God must have been to give them

305
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,980
a comfortable life, to get them unemployed, so they

306
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:59,500
can be used for God’s employment –

307
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,060
They got watches to see, to save the time,

308
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:17,460
save the time, save the time.

309
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,820
For what? To go into a pub?

310
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,620
Or read some horrid books?

311
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:36,260
Or waste your life with these horrible gurus?

312
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,780
So, in the West we have the saints,

313
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:45,180
in the East we have the wisdom.

314
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,580
In the West, people are seeking because

315
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,260
they are seekers.

316
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:02,340
They are a special category of people who are born

317
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,660
in the West.

318
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,980
But they lack the basic wisdom to understand

319
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,540
what is the truth.

320
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,060
What do we have to achieve?

321
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,300
What do we have to become?

322
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:32,420
This basic wisdom will not be told to you by the people

323
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:35,980
who want to make money out of you.

324
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:45,860
They want to make a business out of it.

325
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:52,900
And thus there’s a big problem for the saints of today.

326
00:51:55,780 --> 00:52:00,220
As you belong to that area which I call the shoot

327
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,900
of the tree, people can get enamored by the

328
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:07,860
superficial things.

329
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,820
You can be impressed by somebody who tries

330
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,940
to pamper your ego.

331
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,620
pamper, pamper.

332
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:37,580
Or could be somebody who dominates you, like Hitler.

333
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:46,500
So it is a great responsibility of all the seekers

334
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,980
in the West to take to wisdom, first of all.

335
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:02,700
Logically, you must reach right conclusions.

336
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,620
right conclusions

337
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:20,420
So when it comes to spirituality, you are prepared.

338
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:27,380
Supposing I come to Vienna from somewhere lost

339
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,460
conditions – how will I know this is Vienna,

340
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,060
unless and until somebody says -

341
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:35,300
this is the way to go to Vienna?

342
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:44,100
And how will I know it is Vienna because I should

343
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:49,220
know what Vienna is like, first of all.

344
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:57,940
So, one comes to another conclusion that the

345
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,380
description of the collective consciousness

346
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,940
must be already there in the scriptures

347
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:09,180
which are written long time back.

348
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:20,220
It has to tally with findings of the psychology,

349
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:23,860
like Jung psychology.

350
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,340
It has to tally the many predictions; like thousands

351
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,140
of years back, there was a book written called

352
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,900
Nadi Granth

353
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:44,860
by Bhrigu, who was the pioneer of our astrology.

354
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,060
We should find out from other sources like great poets,

355
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,100
like William Blake, I know English, has clearly written

356
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,060
about Sahaja Yoga.

357
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:08,220
So many such realized people, great people,

358
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:11,460
like Dante, you can say, Homer, you can say,

359
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:18,060
they have written about Sahaja Yoga in so many ways.

360
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,500
If we take to all these things, then we know that

361
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:35,420
this is Vienna.

362
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,460
But we should not be brainwashed by people

363
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,220
who just give us big stories or read some book and

364
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,540
convert it into some other knowledge and say,

365
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:55,140
“This is this, this is this”, and just talk, talk, talk.

366
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:06,940
Now the time has come, to become.

367
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,220
Now the time has come for this divine power

368
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,620
to manifest itself.

369
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:20,980
We see a flower becoming a fruit,

370
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:29,220
billions and billions of them in their seasons.

371
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,820
We see ourselves breathing,

372
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,140
we see ourselves digesting,

373
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,420
we don’t pay for it, do we?

374
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:50,940
Then who is doing all this?

375
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:53,060
Which is that power that is doing?

376
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:57,740
We don’t even think about it.

377
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,820
We just take it for granted.

378
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,580
Look at these eyes that are made, are the best

379
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:13,140
camera that you can think of, so advanced.

380
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,180
Look at this human body, so great.

381
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:28,420
Look at this human brain, so expansive.

382
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:36,780
Why all this was made, and who has done it?

383
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:44,060
Why we have become human beings from amoeba?

384
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:47,660
What is so great about human beings that they are

385
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:53,260
the epitome of all the Creation?

386
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,580
Is it just to sit down and feel guilty about all small

387
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:03,180
nonsensical things?

388
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:10,780
Or to weep over all mundane stuff?

389
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,500
weep

390
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:22,420
No, it is to become something that is the instrument,

391
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:28,220
to know something that will give you the power.

392
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:35,900
This all-pervading power should become your power.

393
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,300
Power is always connected with violence somehow

394
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:50,980
– at this level of human existence.

395
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:58,460
But I’m talking of the power of divine love

396
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:06,780
that transforms this flower into fruit,

397
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:13,900
that has transformed you from amoeba stage to this,

398
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:20,060
and that is going to transform you into your state

399
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:24,260
of Realization.

400
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:31,700
How an egg grows into a bird?

401
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:37,460
And how at the right time

402
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:43,940
the bird comes completely transformed from

403
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:48,620
the ordinary egg?

404
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:57,900
This power is the power of Holy Ghost.

405
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:04,700
People do not like when I talk about Christ.

406
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:10,260
The other day in Belgium a lady asked Me why should

407
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:16,060
I talk about Christ in an Indian way?

408
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:26,820
I told her, “Was Christ born in Belgium?

409
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:32,860
Or was He born a Westerner?”

410
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:39,780
Many know that He lived in India and not in England.

411
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,820
Why, have you taken His contract,

412
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:52,780
that you think you know all about Christ?

413
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,340
You’ll be amazed that about Christ was written

414
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:02,380
fourteen thousand years back in India.

415
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:11,500
Bible is not enough to contain such a great personality.

416
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,860
By saying, “We love God, we love Christ

417
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:27,140
and Christ is love”, this is all imaginary behavior.

418
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:36,500
It’s just a fantasy.

419
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,260
Reality is that Christ exists within you

420
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:44,100
and He is to be awakened within you.

421
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:52,460
It is He who said, “You are to be born again.”

422
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:56,580
What are we doing about it?

423
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,660
We call somebody and say, “All right, I’ll baptize

424
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,460
your child”, artificially you take some water, pour on

425
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:06,820
his head and say, “He’s baptized.”

426
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:15,060
This is all artificial.

427
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:20,500
So, when people get disillusioned from this kind

428
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:26,180
of artificial behavior, they fall into another mess.

429
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:35,740
You don’t have to go anywhere.

430
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:42,580
Your spirit resides within you.

431
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:47,620
You don’t have to go to the forest in seeking.

432
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,540
Your Kundalini is within you.

433
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:57,660
Your centers are there.

434
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,460
The Kundalini will rise and you will become

435
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:04,860
Self-realized.

436
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:12,260
As an egg becomes the transformed bird,

437
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:16,900
you will become the spirit.

438
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,420
You don’t have to run for it.

439
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:28,860
But first thing one must know that we have to know

440
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:33,300
all about it, first of all.

441
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:39,740
If you are still busy with your reading and busy with

442
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,220
your ideas and your conditionings,

443
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:46,820
it’s not going to work out.

444
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,620
It’s act better with the people who are simple

445
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:58,860
and not so complicated.

446
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:05,380
So I would request you to ask Me some questions about it.

447
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:09,420
Today is just an introduction I have given you in short.

448
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,300
You can ask Me questions,

449
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:16,100
but the questions should be

450
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:21,060
suggestive of your seeking, that would be better.

451
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:46,180
If you belong to any cult or any opinion,

452
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,580
you better think about it –

453
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:51,700
what have you got out of it?

454
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:58,980
Here I am,

455
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:02,300
I am saying that you have to be your spirit and

456
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:06,460
can happen through Sahaja Yoga.

457
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:16,220
Sahaja means spontaneous happening,

458
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:22,700
and yoga is the union.

459
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:26,420
And that is what I think we have to achieve,

460
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:30,180
and that’s what you want.

461
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:35,740
But I’ve seen so many people who come just to

462
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:39,740
argue with Me when they haven’t got anything,

463
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:45,060
as just like unpaid pleaders,

464
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:51,820
because they cannot accept

465
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:56,700
that there might have been some mistake.

466
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,820
Human beings after all, have to make mistakes,

467
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,820
there’s no wrong in that.

468
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:14,620
They should not feel guilty about it.

469
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:19,420
They should not feel guilty about anything whatsoever,

470
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,100
because I’m talking about God,

471
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:28,900
who is the ocean of love;

472
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:38,060
who is the ocean of compassion;

473
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:45,740
who is the ocean of forgiveness.

474
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:49,420
But we do not even understand that ocean,

475
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:53,380
how great it is.

476
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:59,780
How beautifully it cleanses us,

477
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,060
gives us a nice bath,

478
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:09,700
beautifully traps us into nice warmth,

479
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:19,340
and takes us to the realm of His kingdom.

480
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:26,060
This is happening en masse now.

481
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:32,220
It is happening in other countries – specially in India

482
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:37,900
thousands of people have got realization in the villages.

483
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,820
And it should happen to all of you here.

484
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:55,900
But if you are not seeking, I cannot force.

485
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:04,860
You cannot take the horse, you can take the horse

486
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:10,860
up to the river, put his mouth in the river –

487
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,900
but the horse has to drink the water

488
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:24,700
and enjoy the satisfaction.

489
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:35,060
This is all your freedom.

490
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:39,820
You have to achieve in your freedom.

491
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:45,820
We cannot force it on anyone.

492
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:55,500
So there is no need for you to be any way aggressive.

493
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:02,900
Because even if I want, I may not be able

494
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:07,540
to give you Realization.

495
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:15,700
It has to work out some time for some people.

496
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:21,060
So I have to request you,

497
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:26,500
be kind to yourself and fair to yourself.

498
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:33,780
You are a seeker and you have to have your Realization.

499
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:41,740
And that is why I’m here.

500
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:47,140
I have come to give you something.

501
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:52,900
That should in no way challenge your ego.

502
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:56,580
As I was telling this morning, I don’t understand

503
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:00,580
any laws, I do not understand any copyright,

504
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,380
I do not understand insurance,

505
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:07,980
I don’t know how to drive.

506
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:21,460
But, one thing I know is Kundalini.

507
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:27,660
So you should not feel hurt if I know it,

508
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:33,500
but you will know yourself.

509
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:43,180
You will be able to do it yourself.

510
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,420
There’s one person in India who got realization and so

511
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:53,660
far he has given realization to ten thousand people.

512
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:04,980
Tomorrow I will also tell you how Kundalini awakening,

513
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:09,340
as a by-product, manifests the curing of incurable

514
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:14,740
diseases like cancer and other diseases.

515
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:27,220
How it cures mental diseases and how it takes you out

516
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:33,660
of the clutches of your bad habits.

517
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:41,340
And how you become your own guru.

518
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,820
So I would like to have some questions from you.

519
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,260
If you have to ask any questions, please ask Me,

520
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:54,340
without any fear.

521
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:59,740
Thank you very much.

522
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:02,980
May God bless you.

523
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:32,260
Mataji, he asks the difference between Purusha

524
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,300
in Indian language and the Holy Ghost?

525
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:36,380
Purusha?

526
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:01,460
Purusha is the God-Almighty.

527
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:05,580
Holy Ghost is His power which manifests this Universe

528
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:11,500
and is the Kundalini within you.

529
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:30,420
That is the Holy Ghost. It’s called as Adi Shakti.

530
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:44,060
Adi Shakti means Primordial Power.

531
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:17,420
He asks what kind of meditation do you request?

532
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:22,460
That I’ll tell you. A good question.

533
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:26,060
That’s what I’m going to tell you.

534
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:36,460
Mother, he asks about the manifestations when

535
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,060
the Kundalini rises?

536
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,540
That I’m going to tell you later on – the whole thing,

537
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:44,620
isn’t it, it’s a complete subject which I’ll handle.

538
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,900
I’m going to be here for three lectures now in Vienna.

539
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:51,220
So in one lecture I thought of giving you the introduction,

540
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,900
and later on I’m definitely going to tell you

541
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:59,340
all things about it. Everything. No secrets.

542
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:01,100
He asks what do you feel physically when the Kundalini rises?

543
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:04,100
That I will tell, just now, I will tell.

544
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,620
That the first time you feel the all-Pervading power

545
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:13,700
as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

546
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:22,980
Coming out of your head also.

547
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:30,060
And in your fingers, you start feeling it all around you.

548
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:39,660
He asks what happens with the breathing and with the heart?

549
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:44,140
You become very normal.

550
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,900
He tells it’s not the Kundalini then.

551
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:53,820
Why, what should happen, you should die?

552
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:56,740
You have read something, now you see for yourself.

553
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:59,260
Reading is not the way to get convinced,

554
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,940
is a mediocracy.

555
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:10,900
You may go on reading thousands of books;

556
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,860
you cannot get your realization from books.

557
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:29,260
Mother, do You believe that

558
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:32,060
we don’t need a guru in general?

559
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:42,100
No, you do need a guru – in the sense that

560
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:47,460
an enlightened light can only enlighten another light.

561
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,860
But where are the real gurus?

562
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:56,260
They are all hiding in the Himalayas or some

563
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,700
other places, and when I tell them, they say,

564
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:00,500
“We are not interested in these people,

565
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:04,180
they are not seekers.”

566
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:15,540
The only people who are interested in your purses

567
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:20,100
are down here, in the market.

568
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:31,300
With great persuasion I sent one guru to America,

569
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,260
who returned within three days.

570
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,060
He said, “I had enough of these Americans –

571
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,780
horrible people.

572
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:47,380
They only understand dollars,

573
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,460
they don’t want to have Reality.

574
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:53,380
They have no time for that.”

575
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:27,500
Mother, he asks if to get Realization is only possible

576
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:31,300
after certain meditation, or if you can prepare

577
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:34,060
the people to get this experience?

578
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:38,060
If you are a human being, you can get Realization.

579
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,740
You are already prepared

580
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:43,060
because you are a human being.

581
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:55,900
But if your human sustenance is little bit spoiled,

582
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:58,300
then the Kundalini, though it comes up, it may go down

583
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:03,700
a little, come up a little, and it will establish itself.

584
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:35,980
Mother, he doesn’t understand how he comes to

585
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:38,740
the spontaneous experience?

586
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:41,580
He thinks, he has to meditate, or something.

587
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,340
You cannot meditate, you go into meditation.

588
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:46,660
That’s very simple, I’ll tell you what happens really.

589
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,660
You have to put your hands towards Me like this.

590
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:52,580
How you see the [tree] leaves become green,

591
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:56,340
in the same way you put your hands towards Me,

592
01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:02,500
and as I am a Realized Soul, the information goes

593
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:04,940
through these fingers.

594
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,660
Through them the information goes to the Kundalini,

595
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,980
and She rises. Spontaneously.

596
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:15,620
Like the Mother Earth, when you put the seed

597
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:18,100
in the Mother Earth, the seed knows it’s

598
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:21,540
the Mother Earth and the primule –

599
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:27,780
the germinating power – arises by itself.

600
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:49,540
Then you are in meditation, you don’t have to do

601
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:53,900
meditation, you are in meditation.

602
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:06,100
When it is obstructed in some people,

603
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:08,500
you can see with the naked eye the pulsation

604
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:13,180
of the Kundalini at the sacrum bone.

605
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:21,180
You can hear the rising of the Kundalini

606
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:24,060
with the stethoscope, even you can see with your

607
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:28,740
naked eyes if there is obstruction.

608
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,660
When She crosses this Agnya Chakra, then you become

609
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:38,420
thoughtlessly aware.

610
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:43,060
You are aware, but there is no thought.

611
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,580
There are many who talk about thoughtless awareness,

612
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:56,140
but they never achieve it.

613
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:02,180
Then you go beyond, when it comes onto the head here,

614
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:06,620
you feel the throbbing on your head here.

615
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,900
And then you start feeling the cool breeze coming

616
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:17,300
out of your head.

617
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:23,700
We must know that what we can do like jumping,

618
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:29,460
doing all other things, can be done by everyone.

619
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:39,980
But the living force does something that we cannot do.

620
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:44,820
We cannot make the cool breeze come out of our head,

621
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:46,740
can we?

622
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:54,980
And you are not to be satisfied,

623
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:57,100
give a false certificate about it;

624
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:01,340
you have to certify yourself.

625
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:11,060
Then your fingers are enlightened.

626
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:15,620
Because these are the seven centers – five, six

627
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:18,940
and seven.

628
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:26,220
About which I’ll tell you tomorrow in details.

629
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:31,900
They will all get enlightened.

630
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:35,460
And from the fingers like this you can make out

631
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:39,780
what chakra of a person is catching.

632
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:46,780
If the left side is catching that means there’s

633
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,580
an emotional problem;

634
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,580
if the right side is catching means there’s physical

635
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:54,300
or mental problem.

636
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,300
Then you can also know the permutations and

637
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:14,580
combinations which are decoded, you can verify them.

638
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:19,380
Sitting down here you can find out about anyone,

639
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,940
even the dead people –

640
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:26,820
were they realized or not?

641
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:38,580
If they were realized you will start getting a cool breeze.

642
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:42,820
That’s the rapport established with the Divine.

643
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:51,860
Any absolute question you ask – and if it is the answer

644
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:58,260
is ‘yes’ – then you get a cool breeze flowing.

645
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:08,820
If somebody is a false person, you get burnings.

646
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:14,260
If he’s a evil genius, you might get even blisters,

647
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:16,220
little bit.

648
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:25,300
If somebody is going to die, then you get numbness

649
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,060
on the fingers.

650
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:28,820
If somebody is going to die, then you get

651
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:32,380
numbness on the fingers.

652
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:39,860
So once you know about the chakras, then you have

653
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:44,300
to know how to correct it.

654
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:54,060
All this knowledge is your own,

655
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:59,060
and is to be given to you.

656
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:03,580
It has to be all free, as I said.

657
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,980
Has to be all free, as I said.

658
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:15,620
It is, I would say, I’m like a cashier in the bank.

659
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:22,060
And I am just giving you what you have got already

660
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:25,460
within yourself.

661
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:30,380
Also the knowledge to know the things that

662
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:34,340
you have got.

663
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:41,940
And how to use them.

664
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:45,700
It cannot be believed that there

665
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:50,820
could be someone like that.

666
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:58,420
There have been many more like this - I am One of them.

667
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:03,060
May God bless you.

668
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:11,700
Which kind of religion do you have, Mother?

669
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:16,700
Is the religion of all the religions.

670
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:21,180
Because it’s the essence of everything.

671
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:28,260
Actually all the religions started with life’s force only.

672
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,740
All the incarnations and prophets were true

673
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:38,180
and all connected.

674
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:45,340
Absolute concord.

675
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:50,540
And it’s such a coordinated thing within ourselves

676
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:54,260
and they are placed within ourselves.

677
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:01,700
But all these beautiful flowers which grew onto

678
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:04,260
the Tree of Life were taken away by each one of them,

679
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:09,980
and they have said, “This is mine, this is mine.”

680
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:21,220
The flowers are dead and ugly.

681
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:33,100
Mataji, many of us have learned that it is extremely

682
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:36,300
dangerous to wake up this Kundalini,

683
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:38,140
I’m sure You know this.

684
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:40,340
Yes, yes, they all say so.

685
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:43,220
That’s the only escape they can have, My child.

686
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:45,580
That’s the only escape they can have.

687
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:47,780
That is a very difficult thing is, your karmas,

688
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:50,580
your this thing.

689
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:04,220
See, if I have to handle that camera,

690
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:08,220
I will say it is very difficult – beyond Me.

691
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:14,100
But I should be honest to say that,

692
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:18,220
“I don’t know anything about it.”

693
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:24,940
I must be knowing something about it,

694
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:29,580
that I say so positively.

695
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,260
Three questions. One by one, now, this gentleman

696
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,820
has asked, this side.

697
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:52,420
Is there any connection to these para-psychological powers?

698
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:57,580
No that is Adi Bhautik. Parapsychology.

699
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:00,700
The parapsychology has to deal with Adi Bhautik,

700
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:06,260
is the left side, the collective subconscious.

701
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:11,820
You cannot explain anything, what you are doing,

702
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:14,620
you see, you are flying in the air, what you are doing,

703
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:19,540
you don’t know. How you are curing, you don’t know.

704
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:25,980
You are blind.

705
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:31,860
But in Sahaja Yoga, even a child knows.

706
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:38,140
If he’s a born-realized, he knows.

707
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:45,060
He knows what chakras people are catching.

708
01:30:47,380 --> 01:30:50,820
If they are very highly Self-realized souls, they also

709
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:54,260
know about Kundalini.

710
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:59,300
There are many children these days born

711
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:03,100
who are realized souls.

712
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,900
But those who are not realized are the parents,

713
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:13,300
and they don’t understand their children.

714
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:18,660
Great saints are taking their birth on this earth

715
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:21,380
these days.

716
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:30,460
Till you get Realization, you won’t understand them.

717
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:35,500
If we have to discuss colors with blind people,

718
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:38,500
how can we?

719
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:44,620
If our eyes are open, if the light is on,

720
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:48,060
we can see everything.

721
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:52,980
It is just a wee bit of jumping, the breakthrough –

722
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:56,100
it’s a little bit.

723
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:04,220
Is a very little bit of jumping for the breakthrough.

724
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:26,340
Mother, he has something to do with geometry.

725
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:31,660
Is there some power in geometric shapes?

726
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:33,900
Of course.

727
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:38,540
Yes, yes, of course.

728
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:41,780
Everything has power.

729
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:45,180
But you don’t know the essence of anything.

730
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:48,740
Mathematics has powers –

731
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:53,140
how do you get your formulae?

732
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:59,620
Your formulae, say for a pi?

733
01:33:21,620 --> 01:33:29,420
(Yogi announces following lectures in Urania, Vienna)

734
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:16,060
Now, we can say – what did you say, Gregoire?

735
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:18,620
Gregoire: I’m just suggesting that as most of the

736
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:21,420
questions are going to be answered in your next lectures…

737
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:23,860
Is better to write down. You see, I’ll answer them,

738
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:27,740
is better, in My speech I will give you answers about it,

739
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:33,260
but moreover it’s the ocean of knowledge.

740
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:42,180
When you will yourself have the light,

741
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:45,740
you can see through, yourself.

742
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:52,260
Now there are some books also written by Sahaja yogis

743
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:56,380
for Sahaja Yoga seekers.

744
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:02,420
But we don’t give them to people who are not yet

745
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:05,540
established.

746
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:10,540
Unless and until your realization is established,

747
01:35:10,860 --> 01:35:14,700
these books are not given to you.

748
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:23,140
Because they can be like any other book,

749
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:32,380
and you may just neglect your growth.

750
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:01,580
What Gopi Krishna wrote about Kundalini… ?

751
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:06,580
Gopi Krishna. – You sell that book off. -

752
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:11,500
Who is Gopi Krishna?

753
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:14,540
Has he given Realization to anyone?

754
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:18,740
What is his authority to write on Kundalini?

755
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,420
He writes like a villager who touches an electric point

756
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:25,460
and says that electricity burns you.

757
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:35,220
He is like – you go and see his private life –

758
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:39,700
what sort of a life he leads.

759
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:43,740
At least you must know that when he talks of Kundalini,

760
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:48,180
he talks as if he’s a third party. Like a shock.

761
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:49,980
You see, like, “I say I get a shock out of it,” means

762
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:54,940
I don’t know anything about it.

763
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:01,900
You want to have another shock?

764
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:08,260
Why do you believe in him? What has he done?

765
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:10,580
You see, just because of reading a book,

766
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:13,820
are you satisfied, my child? You are a seeker,

767
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:16,460
why should you be satisfied with a book?

768
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:18,780
Why don’t you see for yourself?

769
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:22,060
Again I’ve said, just a book he has bought,

770
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:24,700
and he is wasting everybody’s time for one book.

771
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:30,420
He has done no good to anyone.

772
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:34,500
What good he has done is only he has taken sixty-five

773
01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:37,220
lakhs of rupees from Indian government

774
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:41,380
for a so-called research center in India

775
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:45,580
which is not yet started.

776
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:55,620
Because the then minister who was in charge

777
01:37:56,060 --> 01:38:00,100
was also a Kashmiri.

778
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:04,700
I have to tell you one thing:

779
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:07,100
Indians are very intelligent people

780
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:12,780
and if they come to dishonesty, no-one can beat them.

781
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:29,300
They are past masters, they are past masters.

782
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:39,660
I feel otherwise also about Indians that

783
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:45,420
the attacks you did on them as white people,

784
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:48,780
was a gross attack – outside.

785
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:52,940
Now this is a subtle attack is coming on you, from them,

786
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:56,860
which you must understand.

787
01:38:58,740 --> 01:38:59,580
Loudly.

788
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:17,460
So, one must not just believe into something that is published,

789
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:22,460
how much does it take to create a book?

790
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:30,180
Because you have read one book, you have no business

791
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:35,620
to take the time of others. It’s not being civil.

792
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:46,980
Thank you. What else, please?

793
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:05,380
Mother, he thinks it needs a certain maturity

794
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:09,260
of character to raise the Kundalini.

795
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:14,940
Of course, no doubt about it.

796
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:20,420
But this maturity you get with the power of your spirit.

797
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:29,860
When your spirit shines through,

798
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:33,740
your attention becomes enlightened.

799
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:37,740
And then you grow into new areas.

800
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:55,340
We can give you the example of a bird which comes out of an egg.

801
01:40:58,580 --> 01:41:02,060
Actually, in Sanskrit language a bird is called as dvija,

802
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:07,340
and a Self-realized person is also called as dvija.

803
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:16,420
It means ‘twice-born’.

804
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:21,860
First the bird comes out of the egg, then it tries

805
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:26,940
to fly a little bit, and ultimately

806
01:41:27,620 --> 01:41:31,100
it receives the power and it gets confident and it

807
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:35,860
spreads its wings around.

808
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:50,940
But in the beginning, the mother bird looks after

809
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:55,180
the baby bird.

810
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:02,980
She hides behind and calls the little bird

811
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:08,180
so the little bird takes the courage to fly.

812
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:17,420
And that’s how it works out.

813
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:31,260
Now we have got many people from Italy and from England

814
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:35,820
and from Switzerland and from Australia,

815
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:39,740
who have come to help Me here.

816
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:52,660
They are realized souls,

817
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:56,900
they know how to swim.

818
01:42:57,940 --> 01:43:02,060
So, next time I don’t have to import people from outside,

819
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:05,420
I hope in Vienna,

820
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:18,580
because you yourself will grow into beautiful people,

821
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:24,700
all-powerful and all-glorious.

822
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:31,860
I am sure, I can see that.

823
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:36,420
But be truthful.

824
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:39,860
Be honest to yourself,

825
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:44,180
and kind to yourself.

826
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:50,340
Because you are seekers and you do not know your past.

827
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:57,540
So get your crowning glory,

828
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:04,460
and enjoy the eternal bliss of heavens.

829
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:09,380
All right.

830
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:13,980
Now I think we should go in for the experiment.

831
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:23,100
It will not take much time.

832
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:31,700
So, one should go in for it. Without making any effort,

833
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:37,100
you have to just put your hands like this.

834
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:44,500
Take out your shoes,

835
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:49,580
just for the Mother Earth to help us.

836
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:55,300
Put your feet on the ground.

837
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:58,940
Please, put your feet on the ground, straight.

838
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:10,860
And just spread your hands, just like this.

839
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:22,940
And close your eyes.

840
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:25,900
The gentleman who asked question, if he wants to go,

841
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:27,740
he can go away, or if he has to sit here,

842
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:30,060
you better put your hands like this.

843
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:34,940
Because those who are adamant spoil the vibrations of others.

844
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:44,620
They are just here to disturb.

845
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:54,460
If they want to have shocks, let them have shocks.

846
01:45:57,940 --> 01:46:01,060
All right – put your hands like that.

847
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:06,500
Close your eyes, please.

848
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:12,060
You have to keep your eyes shut.

849
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:18,500
It is just the other way than the hypnotism.

850
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:31,980
Now keep your hands straight, relaxed on your lap.

851
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:40,980
And keep your eyes shut.

852
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:46,860
Be comfortable.

853
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:52,260
Don’t put in any effort, please.

854
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:00,500
Just keep your eyes shut, that’s important.

855
01:47:03,820 --> 01:47:08,300
Because when the Kundalini rises above your Agnya,

856
01:47:08,620 --> 01:47:13,540
if the eyes are open, it will be hindered.

857
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:28,420
Now few instructions I’ll give you

858
01:47:28,780 --> 01:47:31,140
how to raise your Kundalini.

859
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:40,580
But don’t open your eyes.

860
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:46,380
Put your left hand towards Me

861
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:48,420
and right hand on your heart.

862
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:57,540
The hand towards Me should be on your lap,

863
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:00,740
the way it was before.

864
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:07,220
On your lap, upward.

865
01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:13,780
Now putting the hand on the spirit

866
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:17,340
you ask a question in your heart,

867
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:23,380
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

868
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:34,820
Ask it thrice.

869
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:46,540
What are you feeling?

870
01:48:54,860 --> 01:49:01,900
Please put your right hand at the left side of your neck,

871
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:05,660
right hand.

872
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:14,500
From the front.

873
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:21,420
Again say it.

874
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:35,900
Now, this is the problem of the West, all the time,

875
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:40,820
I find people feel guilty for nothing at all.

876
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:56,740
And say in your heart,

877
01:49:57,580 --> 01:50:03,060
“Mother, I am not guilty.”

878
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:18,980
Just say it eight times that, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

879
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:51,060
Now put the hand down below, on the stomach

880
01:50:55,900 --> 01:51:01,700
and ask a question, “Mother, am I my own guru?”

881
01:51:05,060 --> 01:51:08,820
Ask ten times.

882
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:14,100
Put the right hand on your stomach

883
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:20,140
and ask a question, “Mother am I my own guru?”

884
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:37,940
Left hand towards Me

885
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:46,780
and on the stomach

886
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:48,220
and ask the question,

887
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:52,860
“Mother am I my own guru?”

888
01:51:54,700 --> 01:52:00,780
Left hand should be kept on the lap. Where is your lap?

889
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:08,180
Ask the question ten times. Say loudly.

890
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:14,820
“Mother am I my own guru?”

891
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:25,660
Now just raise the hand again to your heart,

892
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:33,540
and say, “Mother I am the spirit.”

893
01:52:42,220 --> 01:52:47,060
Say it twelve times.

894
01:52:48,580 --> 01:52:52,460
This is the number of sub-plexuses we have.

895
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:04,780
“Mother, I am the spirit.”

896
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:38,700
Now put this hand again at the neck and say thrice,

897
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:45,420
“Mother I am not guilty.”

898
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:52,900
This is very important.

899
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:05,220
Now put the right hand across your forehead.

900
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:15,260
Now you have to say, “Mother I forgive everyone,

901
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:23,820
with your heart, with honesty you say it twice.

902
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:38,060
Now put the hand on top of your head,

903
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:48,260
touching in the center with your fingers,

904
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:52,740
where you had the soft bone,

905
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:57,060
and move it clockwise.

906
01:54:57,500 --> 01:55:03,740
Move your scalp clockwise, backwards and forwards.

907
01:55:10,540 --> 01:55:12,540
Now raise your hand and see

908
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:15,980
if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

909
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:35,060
What’s it?

910
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:39,980
Higher. Higher.

911
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:57,300
Better.

912
01:55:58,420 --> 01:56:00,820
Warm. It’s hot.

913
01:56:01,420 --> 01:56:05,220
So now you put your left hand on top of your head …

914
01:56:10,060 --> 01:56:13,300
and see if it is cool.

915
01:56:18,980 --> 01:56:20,300
Better.

916
01:56:34,220 --> 01:56:37,460
Again raise your right hand

917
01:56:39,340 --> 01:56:41,580
and put the left hand on the liver.

918
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:45,300
Put your right hand on the head.

919
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:50,140
Liver.

920
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:59,340
Left hand on the liver. That’s wrong.

921
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:02,900
Good.

922
01:57:10,340 --> 01:57:12,980
Put them left to the right now if you can.

923
01:57:13,660 --> 01:57:15,340
Put them left to the right.

924
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:18,220
If you can put them left to the right.

925
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:21,260
And then raise it. Left to the right, left to the right.

926
01:57:23,060 --> 01:57:24,620
That’s all right.

927
01:57:26,140 --> 01:57:29,660
Now see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

928
01:57:37,780 --> 01:57:40,620
Ah, better.

929
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:51,660
Now put both the hands towards Me.

930
01:57:57,660 --> 01:58:02,260
Now see if there’s cool breeze coming in your hands.

931
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:11,300
Just see it.

932
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:14,060
You go round.

933
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:36,780
All right?

934
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:41,460
See if he can feel it?

935
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:59,260
Lower. Press it hard. Press it hard.

936
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:19,700
Just feel his head. Ask him to be comfortable.

937
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:30,620
Please don’t feel guilty.

938
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:33,820
It will work out.

939
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:28,860
How is it? Started?

940
02:02:04,060 --> 02:02:06,420
Hah. Right.

941
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:16,940
Don’t think about it. It starts working.

942
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:19,180
The cool breeze is coming out of many people.

943
02:02:19,620 --> 02:02:23,860
Just see your, raise your hand and see for yourself.

944
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:32,060
Say that the cool breeze is coming out of your head

945
02:02:32,620 --> 02:02:36,660
in many people and see for yourself.

946
02:02:46,780 --> 02:02:49,820
And don’t think about it.

947
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:34,980
Right.

948
02:03:47,380 --> 02:03:55,540
Shri Mataji sends cool breeze through the microphone

949
02:05:04,820 --> 02:05:06,860
Its better now.

950
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:50,740
First you will feel it on top of your head,

951
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:54,180
and then you will feel it on your fingertips,

952
02:05:54,620 --> 02:05:57,980
as you’ll be growing.

953
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:06,780
But some of you might feel both the things.

954
02:06:14,060 --> 02:06:16,300
They’re feeling it?

955
02:06:51,700 --> 02:06:53,500
Better?

956
02:06:54,260 --> 02:06:57,180
Better now?

957
02:07:28,380 --> 02:07:33,140
Put it on the heart.

958
02:07:34,740 --> 02:07:39,500
Little higher. Press it hard.

959
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:49,660
This side. Move it in the center of the heart.

960
02:08:50,540 --> 02:08:54,980
In the center, in the center of the heart, this side,

961
02:08:55,660 --> 02:09:01,540
in the center heart. Press it hard.

962
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:21,380
Put it at the Kundalini.

963
02:09:21,700 --> 02:09:25,420
Put your hand at the Kundalini. Press it hard.

964
02:09:25,820 --> 02:09:30,140
Little higher. Like that.

965
02:09:34,900 --> 02:09:38,460
Place the other hand like that outside.

966
02:09:43,700 --> 02:09:45,740
Left Swadhisthana.

967
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:10,220
Right Swadhisthana.

968
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:06,620
Some of you have to say again that,

969
02:11:06,940 --> 02:11:09,780
“Mother, I am not guilty.”

970
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:15,660
Now you have to say,

971
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:19,340
“Mother, please give me my realization.”

972
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:30,620
You have to ask because I cannot overcome your freedom.

973
02:11:54,420 --> 02:11:56,540
Right heart.

974
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:02,220
Ask seven times please.

975
02:13:48,740 --> 02:13:50,420
Once you feel the cool breeze you’ll tie up …

976
02:13:50,900 --> 02:13:54,100
all the Sahaja yogis should tie them up.

977
02:15:19,140 --> 02:15:21,580
Those who are feeling the cool breeze over their head,

978
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:26,380
please raise your hands, all of you.

979
02:15:31,620 --> 02:15:33,860
You can see for yourself.

980
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:49,980
Just move your hand up and down.

981
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:12,380
He’s got it.

982
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:23,740
Raise your hand if you have got cool breeze in the hand.

983
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:31,820
Raise them.

984
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:38,740
Got it? Horrible. But it will go out.

985
02:16:40,180 --> 02:16:42,780
You’ll have to give up that man.

986
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:48,140
But to keep it up and to establish it

987
02:16:48,580 --> 02:16:51,340
you have to listen to us.

988
02:16:58,060 --> 02:17:00,460
You have got it because of your seeking

989
02:17:03,900 --> 02:17:07,060
but it will go down

990
02:17:09,260 --> 02:17:12,420
in case you have problems

991
02:17:16,940 --> 02:17:21,300
or you are doing things which should not be done.

992
02:17:23,220 --> 02:17:26,860
So please listen to us.

993
02:17:28,780 --> 02:17:30,540
Again tomorrow please come

994
02:17:33,940 --> 02:17:38,060
and you’ll grow more

995
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:48,420
and you will find the difference tomorrow again.

996
02:17:51,260 --> 02:17:56,220
You must take out everything that is in your neck in the night.

997
02:17:58,420 --> 02:18:01,420
Take out your watches.

998
02:18:01,980 --> 02:18:05,100
Place yourself free.

999
02:18:08,900 --> 02:18:12,060
And they will give you the photograph.

1000
02:18:12,460 --> 02:18:14,820
Have you got? Today?

1001
02:18:16,060 --> 02:18:19,980
All right, tomorrow they’ll give you the photograph.

1002
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:28,180
And tomorrow again we have to re-establish.

1003
02:18:35,220 --> 02:18:39,900
Please don’t think about it and discuss it.

1004
02:18:44,780 --> 02:18:48,500
It is beyond thought.

1005
02:18:50,580 --> 02:18:54,060
Maintain your peaceful behavior.

1006
02:19:01,180 --> 02:19:04,540
May God bless you.

1007
02:19:06,300 --> 02:19:10,660
I will teach you now how to raise your Kundalini.

1008
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:19,140
Get your eyes open.

1009
02:19:32,580 --> 02:19:38,140
You put your hand in the centre of Kundalini, left hand.

1010
02:19:40,940 --> 02:19:45,500
And now start rolling, your right hand.

1011
02:19:46,180 --> 02:19:49,420
This is the hand of your action.

1012
02:19:50,980 --> 02:19:55,540
This way. Take it forward, downward,

1013
02:19:55,900 --> 02:19:58,100
backwards and upwards.

1014
02:20:03,780 --> 02:20:06,940
Now put up your hands as much as you can

1015
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:11,780
and give it a knot, to your Kundalini.

1016
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:15,700
That’s the first time.

1017
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:21,060
Now take another, awakening.

1018
02:20:21,740 --> 02:20:23,860
Move your hand again the same way slowly.

1019
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:26,060
Your hand will roll itself.

1020
02:20:26,860 --> 02:20:29,940
When it is cleared out it will move much faster,

1021
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:33,180
but do not force it.

1022
02:20:34,100 --> 02:20:37,540
Now take it on top of your head and give it one knot,

1023
02:20:37,540 --> 02:20:38,540
slowly, turn it quite a lot

1024
02:20:39,060 --> 02:20:42,220
and give it a knot and take it down.

1025
02:20:46,220 --> 02:20:47,900
Now take another one.

1026
02:20:48,380 --> 02:20:51,580
This is the last and the third one.

1027
02:20:59,260 --> 02:21:05,380
Now take your hands as far as possible and give a big...

1028
02:21:05,380 --> 02:21:07,820
Now do tie these knots -

1029
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:16,540
one, two and three and bring down.

1030
02:21:20,260 --> 02:21:23,140
Do your hands like this.

1031
02:21:23,820 --> 02:21:27,380
Throw away everything and now see.

1032
02:21:29,540 --> 02:21:33,500
Now see the flow in the hands.

1033
02:21:36,340 --> 02:21:39,340
Feeling the cool breeze?

1034
02:21:42,140 --> 02:21:44,780
Some of you will definitely feel it.

1035
02:21:53,940 --> 02:21:57,180
You’ll feel very peaceful, comfortable,

1036
02:21:57,700 --> 02:22:00,380
and you’ll sleep very well.

1037
02:22:05,340 --> 02:22:07,100
Wear plain clothes,

1038
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:10,140
loose clothes in the night

1039
02:22:10,540 --> 02:22:14,580
loose clothes and plain; plain; means not colored

1040
02:22:22,940 --> 02:22:26,940
and when you come tomorrow, don’t discuss it.

1041
02:22:28,140 --> 02:22:33,940
I’m here for two days and I’m sure I’ll establish it before going.

1042
02:22:43,500 --> 02:22:45,220
I have to make a humble request,

1043
02:22:45,660 --> 02:22:47,780
to people who are wearing orange clothes and all that

1044
02:22:48,180 --> 02:22:51,900
please take them out.

1045
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:08,180
If time comes tomorrow I’ll tell you the secret

1046
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:12,140
of that also.

1047
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:17,420
Listen to Me for six-seven days when you with Me.

1048
02:23:30,980 --> 02:23:33,780
I’m your Mother and I’ve come here to tell you

1049
02:23:34,220 --> 02:23:38,660
something that is the Truth.

1050
02:23:41,660 --> 02:23:44,700
So just listen to Me, wear simple dresses,

1051
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:49,740
tomorrow come in a simple dress, not tight dresses,

1052
02:23:50,180 --> 02:23:52,620
so that Kundalini is easily...

1053
02:24:00,780 --> 02:24:03,100
Something normal, wear something normal,

1054
02:24:03,100 --> 02:24:06,140
whatever is normal for Vienna people,

1055
02:24:06,820 --> 02:24:09,500
they should wear that way.

1056
02:24:11,220 --> 02:24:14,140
Nothing abnormal.

1057
02:24:14,660 --> 02:24:18,220
May God bless you.
