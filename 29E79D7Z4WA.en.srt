1
00:04:55,176 --> 00:05:01,698
The other day I told you about the center of Christ

2
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:05,222
and center of Shri Krishna

3
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:07,841
and their relationship with each other.

4
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:13,334
Now the last and the most important center

5
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:22,576
one within us is the center of Sahasrara is the limbic area.

6
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:28,540
When you enter into it you become thoughtlessly aware.

7
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:33,230
This is the area to be entered through the Kundalini,

8
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,730
through the center of Christ,

9
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:40,127
through the Gate of Christ and that's why is written

10
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:44,543
that you have to enter through Him.

11
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,244
But not by somebody else saying, "I'm the Christ" or

12
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:52,005
saying, "I profess Christ and Christ"

13
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:54,505
It's not that way. Christ is within us

14
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,657
and when the Kundalini rises,

15
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:01,157
if it stops at this center,

16
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:03,969
you have to take His name. Not

17
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:09,308
the people who are not realized, but realized people have to chant His name,

18
00:06:10,165 --> 00:06:14,369
then only the Kundalini pierces through that center of Christ,

19
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:19,133
that's the door, that's the gate He's talked about,

20
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:22,387
and then you enter into the Kingdom of God.

21
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:31,009
"Thou shalt inherit the Kingdom of God." Inherit.

22
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,509
That's your Father's Kingdom

23
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:36,723
and that you have to inherit.

24
00:06:38,116 --> 00:06:42,750
But now the most important is the last center of Sahasrara.

25
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:49,495
When you have all the seven centers placed one after another,

26
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:53,545
these centers are really the seats

27
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:56,045
of all the Deities we have talked about.

28
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:00,737
The seats are in the brain,

29
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:03,676
their aura is around the heart

30
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:08,671
but they are actually sleeping in the

31
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:13,496
"Sthanas" as we call, the places of centers.

32
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:18,392
So, it is in three ways you can understand. One,

33
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:23,866
in the brain, there are seven centers of the seats

34
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:28,475
and their auras are falling on the heart.

35
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:37,764
Their places are in the center.

36
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:42,154
And the first stage of the awakening of the Kundalini

37
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:44,654
only these Deities get awakened.

38
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:50,360
That means when you chant any word or you call Them by name,

39
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,557
They react. In the sense They open the chakras. You can

40
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:57,100
feel it; you can see it

41
00:07:57,266 --> 00:08:00,107
clearly with your own eyes the Kundalini rising through them.

42
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:04,504
Then later on, when you grow more and more,

43
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:10,256
these Deities leave Their places and occupy Their seats

44
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:14,228
and even the Spirit, which is in the heart,

45
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,537
comes up here

46
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:19,912
on the fontanel bone area where there is the heart,

47
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:26,319
seat of the heart center, which is the heart here, opened goes there.

48
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:29,360
But it is at a much later state,

49
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:35,362
that state at a much later time, we can say much later

50
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:37,747
state of your mind it's a,

51
00:08:37,903 --> 00:08:39,763
you get into that speed

52
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:43,068
in which you just achieve that state.

53
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:45,132
It is an achievement.

54
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,639
It cannot be a false certificate from somebody or one can say this is written

55
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:51,433
in the book. So this and this.

56
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:53,226
There's no calculation like that.

57
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:56,599
It has to mature in its living way

58
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:59,351
and you yourself will know

59
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:02,317
that you have got now complete Self-realization.

60
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:07,675
First thing you get is thoughtless awareness.

61
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:12,103
With this you cross the Gate of Christ.

62
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:15,867
You can cure people, you can raise the Kundalini.

63
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:19,288
You may also be able to give Realization to people.

64
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,804
But still you are capable of falling out.

65
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:26,542
Supposing somebody, a person comes

66
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:30,797
with negative forces and fanaticism

67
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:35,001
he may encompass you. And you may go down.

68
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:40,044
But the second state is called as the doubtless awareness.

69
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:44,139
If you rise into that then you have no doubts whatsoever.

70
00:09:44,832 --> 00:09:48,610
You never fall down. Maybe your Kundalini comes and goes and

71
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:51,791
supplies and sometimes you can feel the catches, it's all right.

72
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:53,521
But after that,

73
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:56,021
you are so sure of yourself

74
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:01,113
and of your achievement, your Self-Realization that you never falloff.

75
00:10:02,798 --> 00:10:06,185
But the last one is the very important thing

76
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,181
where many Sahaja yogis also falter,

77
00:10:09,212 --> 00:10:11,212
is the integration.

78
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:14,738
For example, a somebody's born a Christian,

79
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:16,804
he's born.

80
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:19,740
He could have been born a Hindu; he could have been born anything.

81
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,464
He could have been Muslim.

82
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:23,633
Muslim I have seen one fanatic,

83
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,241
like a Muslim if he a fanatic he is

84
00:10:26,385 --> 00:10:28,385
born today as a fanatic Hindu

85
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:29,699
or a fanatic Christian,

86
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,506
these are all fanatics.

87
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:34,501
They go from one swing to another swing and they profess.

88
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:36,393
He will have Koran in his hand,

89
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:39,618
this fellow will have Bible in his hand and another will have Gita in his hand,

90
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:40,795
three of them are fighting.

91
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:44,348
He says I'm correct, he says I'm correct and he says I'm correct.

92
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:45,853
Now what is the authority?

93
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:49,206
Even of these books people will ask what is the authority of the Bible.

94
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:51,844
What is the authority of the Gita

95
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:54,016
and what is the authority of the Koran?

96
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:56,047
They'll say what is the authority of The Old Testament?

97
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:59,147
If they ask authority, what is the answer?

98
00:10:59,344 --> 00:11:01,344
And you can ask what is my authority?

99
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:04,175
You must ask this question.

100
00:11:04,675 --> 00:11:07,173
In the beginning people do ask what is my authority.

101
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:09,950
My authority is that I give you Realization.

102
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:13,575
And you ask the question, "Mother are you the authority?"

103
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:15,744
you get vibrations.

104
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:17,851
This is my authority.

105
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,851
Then you will understand why Bible is right, Koran is right and Gita is right.

106
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:26,013
Because of the narrow vision we have.

107
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:29,067
If they are born as a Christian then they'll stick into it.

108
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,536
If you are Catholics you will be Protestants, if you are

109
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:32,916
Protestants you'll become

110
00:11:32,947 --> 00:11:35,145
a 7th Day Adventist, Pentecostals,

111
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:37,423
this that, born again, this that nonsense

112
00:11:37,592 --> 00:11:42,001
we go on ending up like that in a Christian genealogy,

113
00:11:42,308 --> 00:11:45,103
from one madness to another madness achieving nothing,

114
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,272
believing into some sort of a theoretical thing

115
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:50,377
like 7th Day Adventist.

116
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,688
I can't understand it.

117
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:56,218
These theories and these things are not going to give you

118
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:58,387
living experience,

119
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:01,402
which is beyond rationality, which is beyond mind,

120
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:04,531
which is Baptism, the real sense of the word,

121
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:07,897
where you get this breeze in the hand, of the Holy Spirit.

122
00:12:09,252 --> 00:12:12,931
But we want to play about with these things with our narrow visions now see

123
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
one case of Christ.

124
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,755
Christ was definitely, as I told you, was

125
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:21,784
Pranava, Omkara, everything was there,

126
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:23,445
no doubt.

127
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:27,080
But when He was born,

128
00:12:27,992 --> 00:12:29,992
there was signs and everything.

129
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:33,377
Despite all that there was a king who wanted to kill Him.

130
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:40,284
See the negativity. No intellectual accepted Him.

131
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:42,431
No bureaucrat accepted Him,

132
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:45,478
no educated person accepted Him.

133
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:48,137
He had to actually beg of those

134
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:52,387
very ordinary, mediocre people

135
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:56,053
like fishermen to come and become His disciples.

136
00:12:56,553 --> 00:12:57,854
See the situation.

137
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,410
And He was allowed to live

138
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:02,019
only for 4 years

139
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:03,533
by these horrible people.

140
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:05,875
They may be born today as Christians and must be saying we are

141
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:08,460
Christians and Christ and Christ and Christ.

142
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:10,848
That's why Christ has said I will not recognize you.

143
00:13:13,645 --> 00:13:16,260
They might be the people who might have crucified Christ.

144
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:18,248
And they're again crucifying Him

145
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:21,140
by denying the living force of the living God.

146
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:25,364
Four years.

147
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:27,573
Now, what can you do in four years? I told you

148
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:31,531
four years, with all my powers, I was struggling with six hippies

149
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,090
giving them realization in London city.

150
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:39,300
He never even thought of giving Realization because He thought

151
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:42,307
first of all they have no brains even to understand what is Realization.

152
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:45,470
Whatever He said,

153
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,755
He said it very precise and deep.

154
00:13:47,823 --> 00:13:49,823
If anything that is narrow has to be deep.

155
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,943
Which cannot go into the heads of people who just listen to

156
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:55,113
sermons and lectures

157
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:59,481
and read books and sort of have big theories built up into anything.

158
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:03,695
It will only be possible when you get your Realization,

159
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:08,940
when you get your collective consciousness, when you become baptized.

160
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:13,244
Then only you will be able to see what He talked about.

161
00:14:13,528 --> 00:14:15,706
Before that it's only mental activity,

162
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:18,827
quarrelling, fighting and living on artificial things.

163
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:20,947
How long are you going to do like that?

164
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:24,807
Your forefathers did it and their forefathers did it and their

165
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:26,302
forefathers have done it.

166
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:29,312
Now is it not time for you

167
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:31,812
to see that a new age has come?

168
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,217
What are you going to lose by that?

169
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:37,085
You form organizations

170
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:39,134
false and false and false.

171
00:14:39,536 --> 00:14:41,536
There should be some honesty about it.

172
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:45,749
Just talking talking morning till evening,

173
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:48,702
you are not going to receive any knowledge about Christ I can tell you.

174
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:53,715
This narrow vision of Christianity

175
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:59,088
has killed Christ and Christianity good.

176
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:01,352
The narrow vision of Jews

177
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,005
has killed Moses and Abraham.

178
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:06,289
The narrow vision of Krishna

179
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,911
and the narrow vision of all these people

180
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:12,537
has killed them.

181
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:16,532
They have dead in them. Your children are going to challenge you.

182
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,287
They are going to ask you,

183
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:21,011
what foolish things you have been doing all your lives.

184
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,039
They are going to ask you why did you do it?

185
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:29,539
Have you any answer to give?

186
00:15:31,354 --> 00:15:34,170
For that one has to understand

187
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:36,914
that we have now found our absolute.

188
00:15:37,884 --> 00:15:40,367
You be honest yourself. Have you found your absolute?

189
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,041
We have not yet found our absolute.

190
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,819
That's what you have to find.

191
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:49,494
You are to be born again. Not to certificate yourself that

192
00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:51,524
I am born again. I have seen many people,

193
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:53,920
I am born again. Really? How do you say?

194
00:15:55,082 --> 00:15:57,658
Can you feel the chakras of another person?

195
00:15:57,688 --> 00:16:00,277
Are you collectively conscious? Can you feel your own chakras?

196
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:01,979
Can you clarify yourself is there any

197
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:03,921
transformation? No transformation.

198
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:08,058
Then you have among Jews also

199
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:10,750
very fanatic people. Muslims

200
00:16:13,357 --> 00:16:14,254
have lost

201
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:19,391
even the recognition of God's

202
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:21,527
mercy and compassion.

203
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,686
It is such a sad state. At this

204
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:29,395
sad state and confusion,

205
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:31,267
there has to be

206
00:16:32,377 --> 00:16:34,115
the integrating force.

207
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:36,861
And that integrating force is your Spirit.

208
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:41,783
That integration takes place in this seventh chakra of Sahasrara.

209
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:45,067
All the seven centers are there

210
00:16:45,654 --> 00:16:49,380
and all the centers are coordinated and co-related

211
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,896
and that's how, at the seventh chakra only you can get your Realization.

212
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:59,256
He didn't allow any one of them

213
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,986
to say anything about it.

214
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:04,854
If they try to say anything you brake bright out of the book,

215
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:06,883
oh see this book is written it is written

216
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,895
in so and so and this is written so and so.

217
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,395
Say for example when Christ was born.

218
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:15,044
It was said that

219
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:19,250
a child will be born to a girl.

220
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:23,357
Kanya. In Sanskrit language it's Kanya.

221
00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:27,705
Now in England there was a controversy about it,

222
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:30,630
Now I think the Jews started it maybe, I don't know who started it.

223
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:32,343
Or maybe the Muslims.

224
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:36,794
God only knows. They go into all these details of that thing to find out

225
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,386
they said it was not said

226
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:41,696
that He will be born of virgin but it was said of the girl.

227
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:46,363
So one of the Sahaja yogi wrote a nice letter to them,

228
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:47,905
of course under my guidance

229
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,546
saying that

230
00:17:49,698 --> 00:17:52,413
at the time when Christ was born, even before that,

231
00:17:53,313 --> 00:17:55,437
this prophecy was made and that time,

232
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:57,676
a girl meant a virgin.

233
00:17:58,054 --> 00:17:59,806
These are not modern times when

234
00:17:59,836 --> 00:18:01,203
a woman who is divorced

235
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,063
10 times and 80 years

236
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:06,895
is her age, and she's still called as 'my girl'.

237
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:10,843
These are foolish stupid modern times

238
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:14,853
where there's no difference between a girl and a woman.

239
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:18,311
That time a girl meant,

240
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:20,898
even today in India, Kanya means a virgin.

241
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:25,018
Girl means a virgin. It's the same thing.

242
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,903
All such things have been raised against

243
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,468
either Christ or Moses or Mohammad or this and that.

244
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,690
I mean there only busy

245
00:18:37,805 --> 00:18:40,641
raising things against each other, that's what they are doing.

246
00:18:41,878 --> 00:18:44,957
According to them, what they say is the truth? What have they found?

247
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:49,141
First thing, can they cure cancer?

248
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:56,503
Let's see, let's have this challenge.

249
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,449
Can they give peace to anyone? Are they peaceful?

250
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,529
Have they been able to get over their adulterous eyes?

251
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:09,294
Any transformation?

252
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:11,195
Nothing.

253
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,690
So accept it. Be honest with yourself.

254
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:19,975
You have no business to cheat yourself, or anything whatsoever.

255
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:23,247
If you are hypnotized

256
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,747
awaken yourself.

257
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:29,724
arise and find what is the best,

258
00:19:30,557 --> 00:19:35,560
absolute and the only thing that you have to find, your Spirit.

259
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:40,540
Your Spirit resides in the heart.

260
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,315
It is the reflection of God Almighty.

261
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,964
It enjoys itself, by itself.

262
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:56,604
It is the spectator of the world, of its power,

263
00:19:58,139 --> 00:19:59,090
The Holy Ghost.

264
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:04,308
It watches you

265
00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:08,511
and is called as the knower of the fate.

266
00:20:10,695 --> 00:20:13,496
It knows what you are doing,

267
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:16,259
what are your aspirations,

268
00:20:16,952 --> 00:20:19,028
what mistakes you are committing.

269
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:21,984
It goes to a long extent

270
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,110
to forgive and forgive and forgive.

271
00:20:25,242 --> 00:20:28,971
Forgiveness is one of the qualities of the Spirit.

272
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,664
It forgives you

273
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:38,225
and says it will work out.

274
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:40,725
It will come around.

275
00:20:41,225 --> 00:20:43,225
But when you go too far,

276
00:20:43,304 --> 00:20:46,134
say if you pay too much attention to your physical being

277
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:48,827
or to your mental being,

278
00:20:50,713 --> 00:20:53,626
if you try to think too much,

279
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:58,533
the Spirit indicates its displeasure

280
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:01,033
and you get a heart attack.

281
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:05,884
Heart attack comes to you

282
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:07,963
through displeasure of the Spirit.

283
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:11,987
If the Spirit is angry with you, you get a heart attack.

284
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:16,202
That means you've neglected your Spirit,

285
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:19,088
you've paid attention to things

286
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:20,247
which are not important.

287
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:25,466
You have looked after things which are not important.

288
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:29,422
You have not worried about yourself, about the Spirit, about your seeking.

289
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:33,325
Even if you're lost, say in any fanatic behavior

290
00:21:33,386 --> 00:21:35,790
of reading some books and things and

291
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:38,733
taking out certain things and remembering them by heart and

292
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,315
having an argument and goes on later all that,

293
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:44,815
in all genuineness and goodness

294
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:48,620
but stupidity then also you can get heart attack.

295
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:53,229
Heart is very important.

296
00:21:55,175 --> 00:21:57,358
It sometimes gives you

297
00:21:57,637 --> 00:22:01,570
first warning by giving you a partial paralysis

298
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:05,015
because in the heart is sort of a,

299
00:22:05,816 --> 00:22:10,652
resentment is created by the Spirit which creates a clot,

300
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:15,026
a clot, and that clot when goes into the brain

301
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:18,381
you get a partial paralysis,

302
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:21,162
so that you do not move any further.

303
00:22:22,505 --> 00:22:24,505
Your attention is taken to it.

304
00:22:24,724 --> 00:22:26,724
Then you start thinking of God,

305
00:22:26,782 --> 00:22:28,782
thinking of all the things

306
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:31,282
and maybe

307
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:35,148
then if you come to Sahaja yoga you get cured

308
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:38,476
because again your Spirit forgives you.

309
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:43,754
We are taking too much liberty with our Spirit.

310
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,737
It is true God has given you freedom

311
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:54,183
and He is not going to take away your freedom at any cost.

312
00:22:54,683 --> 00:22:57,307
You have to be absolutely free to choose

313
00:22:57,345 --> 00:22:59,734
whether to go to heaven or to go to hell.

314
00:23:00,234 --> 00:23:02,234
He is not going to force you.

315
00:23:02,734 --> 00:23:04,734
Only thing one can do

316
00:23:04,832 --> 00:23:07,923
is to explain to you and tell you

317
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:10,566
that this is the way you go to hell.

318
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:12,885
Even then if you want to go

319
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,059
then what can anybody do about it?

320
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:21,642
Even God, He doesn't want to challenge your freedom at all.

321
00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:24,770
He doesn't want to make you, in any way

322
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:26,929
bound to Him, like some people are,

323
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,947
bound just bound, without understanding.

324
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,943
But He wants your complete liberation.

325
00:23:33,222 --> 00:23:36,729
So the first stage is that you have to choose your liberation

326
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,610
through your own freedom of choice.

327
00:23:41,014 --> 00:23:44,023
Now, up to this point, till you were human beings,

328
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:47,226
there was no choice for you,

329
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,469
but after becoming a human being

330
00:23:50,668 --> 00:23:53,689
you were given the choice because you could develop well

331
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:58,218
to understand what is right and wrong in your own freedom,

332
00:23:58,718 --> 00:24:02,392
so that you can enter into the Kingdom of God as

333
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:04,122
people

334
00:24:04,963 --> 00:24:09,071
who are free and have chosen good in their own glory

335
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,250
and in their own freedom.

336
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:17,109
This is the only small little step

337
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:22,736
where we always confuse our freedom with our ego.

338
00:24:24,782 --> 00:24:27,704
For example, now,

339
00:24:28,806 --> 00:24:31,707
this hall is here say, for me to speak.

340
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:37,765
Somebody comes from outside who has been sort of

341
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:40,909
worked up in some sort of an organization and

342
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:44,606
he thinks he is doing the greatest work in the whole world in such a myth.

343
00:24:45,387 --> 00:24:47,830
Comes down here in that ego state,

344
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:49,969
sits down here and asks me

345
00:24:50,108 --> 00:24:53,800
questions after questions, questions after questions, questions after questions,

346
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,604
doesn't allow anybody else to speak,

347
00:24:56,823 --> 00:24:59,104
takes away all my time to himself

348
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:02,978
as if this hall is booked by him and all the audience is gathered by him.

349
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:07,094
He is least bother as to see

350
00:25:07,393 --> 00:25:10,355
that this is an ego that is working.

351
00:25:12,582 --> 00:25:14,582
So we should not

352
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:17,210
confuse our freedom with ego,

353
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,630
that's what I have to give you a counsel.

354
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:26,388
Try to differentiate your ego from your freedom.

355
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:30,575
When you are ego bound, you are a slave of your ego.

356
00:25:31,918 --> 00:25:33,736
When you are super ego bound,

357
00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:36,176
you are slave of your super ego,

358
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,709
of your conditioning.

359
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:39,747
For example, you are born a Christian, you are a Christian

360
00:25:39,825 --> 00:25:41,403
you are bound forever then.

361
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:46,456
All right, you are a Christian but what about real Christianity within you.

362
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:48,956
What about your rebirth in the real sense of the word.

363
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,338
So you become enslaved to these things, so there is no freedom.

364
00:25:56,838 --> 00:25:58,838
And Spirit is

365
00:25:58,997 --> 00:26:01,721
the freedom, is the free.

366
00:26:02,221 --> 00:26:04,221
Being within us.

367
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:06,721
It is detached.

368
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:08,759
It cannot be killed.

369
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:11,259
It cannot be blown away.

370
00:26:11,418 --> 00:26:13,478
It cannot be burnt away.

371
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,044
It is eternal. Anand. It is eternal.

372
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:23,342
That Spirit is joy.

373
00:26:24,344 --> 00:26:27,013
That Spirit is the source of joy.

374
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,726
That emits joy.

375
00:26:31,668 --> 00:26:36,471
Joy is different from happiness and unhappiness.

376
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:40,413
Ego, when it feels pampered, it feels happy.

377
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:43,281
I like it, I like it.

378
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:45,781
This "I" business

379
00:26:47,345 --> 00:26:49,767
is ego pampering

380
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:53,614
that is no joy. Because you like to drink today

381
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:56,672
and tomorrow you don't like to have a headache.

382
00:26:57,625 --> 00:27:00,496
It has the double side of I like and I don't like.

383
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:08,900
You like something through your ego, dislike through your super ego.

384
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:13,392
So it is a one coin

385
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:17,084
and there are two faces, one is happiness and another is unhappiness.

386
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:21,538
Joy is beyond that. Joy is a drama

387
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:27,130
seer, is a witness. You see a drama. You know it's a drama going on.

388
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:30,677
You just watch it as a drama. You're not involved

389
00:27:30,786 --> 00:27:32,786
and you are seeing it and enjoying it.

390
00:27:33,286 --> 00:27:34,977
You are crying if you see something, you're

391
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:37,400
weeping but you know you are not that, it's a drama.

392
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
Seer, the witness.

393
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,202
Your Spirit is the witness

394
00:27:44,242 --> 00:27:46,242
and when you become the Spirit

395
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:48,742
you become the witness.

396
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:52,742
You become the witness. For example,

397
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:57,139
you are seeing something through a window.

398
00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:00,231
There is something exists in the window for example.

399
00:28:01,728 --> 00:28:07,074
Now you enter inside the room and you see through the window.

400
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:12,997
Your conditioning is like one way arising in you as a thought,

401
00:28:12,998 --> 00:28:14,629
which comes from the past.

402
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:18,303
It rises again and another thought comes up and goes

403
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:21,416
in the past.

404
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:23,640
First the past thought is there and

405
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:26,140
then another future thought is there it disappears.

406
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,939
You see the thought rising but you can't see a disappearing of the thought.

407
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:32,439
In between that is the present.

408
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:36,113
That's the place is established, that present

409
00:28:36,345 --> 00:28:37,483
is established

410
00:28:37,657 --> 00:28:41,600
when your attention becomes enlightened by the Spirit.

411
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,986
Either you think of the future or of the past.

412
00:28:45,831 --> 00:28:49,191
But I say now. At this moment, at the present.

413
00:28:51,224 --> 00:28:52,816
You cannot stand there

414
00:28:52,987 --> 00:28:55,316
because your Spirit is not enlightened.

415
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,334
Because Spirit is the present.

416
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:03,093
When you get your Realization,

417
00:29:03,593 --> 00:29:06,993
you find that you are not thinking

418
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:09,590
of the future or the past, you are just enjoying.

419
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,090
Everything becomes different.

420
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,328
The whole life becomes a drama

421
00:29:16,828 --> 00:29:18,828
and the joy out of it starts coming out

422
00:29:19,328 --> 00:29:22,234
and you really enjoy small, small things here and there

423
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:25,612
and you really understand

424
00:29:25,904 --> 00:29:28,414
how much joy was lost before Realization.

425
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,985
This is not a mental thing that gives you joy

426
00:29:32,923 --> 00:29:36,082
but the joy pours on you from your head just like this,

427
00:29:36,145 --> 00:29:38,236
cool thing starts pouring down.

428
00:29:39,274 --> 00:29:43,033
As some people have a feeling of a tension rising up,

429
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:46,764
it's the same way, a cool sort of thing,

430
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:53,149
flow of joy you feel in your whole body pours out.

431
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:56,354
Sometimes this cool breeze that rises in the head

432
00:29:56,854 --> 00:30:01,212
also starts becoming like a fountain pouring down that joy within you.

433
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:05,113
You look at the pictures, are examples see this star of Moses.

434
00:30:06,176 --> 00:30:08,176
You David star you see that

435
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:12,164
when you see than you can think about it

436
00:30:12,664 --> 00:30:14,664
or else just watch this.

437
00:30:14,977 --> 00:30:16,977
Watch it and don't think.

438
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,216
The joy of the creation of that thing, whole thing,

439
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:23,716
becomes one with you.

440
00:30:23,862 --> 00:30:29,472
Like all the creation around a lake

441
00:30:31,305 --> 00:30:35,102
is completely felt in the lake

442
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,126
if the lake has no ripples.

443
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:41,549
Completely. In the same way, all that is joy,

444
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:45,355
the creator, whosoever it may be has put there.

445
00:30:45,855 --> 00:30:49,045
You get the complete joy within yourself because there is no thought.

446
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:53,048
There is no barrier. No conditioning.

447
00:30:53,694 --> 00:30:55,694
The whole thing becomes one with you

448
00:30:56,194 --> 00:30:58,194
and you start feeling extremely happy.

449
00:30:59,152 --> 00:31:01,152
Extremely joyous.

450
00:31:03,214 --> 00:31:07,772
A feeling, which is indescribable.

451
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:10,001
It is to be just enjoyed,

452
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,946
to be felt. Like Kabira was asked,

453
00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:16,931
"Why don't you speak now?" So he says in Hindi language,

454
00:31:16,952 --> 00:31:18,952
he is one of the terrific poets we have,

455
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,825
he says, "Jab mast huye to kya huye.

456
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:30,919
When I have gone into the nectar of the intoxication

457
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:33,773
of the Spirit, now what can I talk.

458
00:31:33,877 --> 00:31:37,361
There no word. No cup can fill this joy,

459
00:31:37,674 --> 00:31:40,057
no words can fill this meaning.

460
00:31:40,307 --> 00:31:43,582
You better be with me and get it and enjoy yourself."

461
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:45,255
That's all he could say.

462
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:47,922
That's what I say, the narrow vision

463
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:51,649
has closed your eyes to so many things.

464
00:31:51,753 --> 00:31:53,753
Even Christ you cannot understand.

465
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:57,790
About Christ it is written in Devi Mahatmya, about Maha Vishnu,

466
00:31:57,978 --> 00:32:02,070
all His life is written, if you can read it you can find out

467
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:04,955
that before coming on this earth you will see

468
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,256
how He was created, what powers He was given,

469
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,991
how He is the Son and all that is written.

470
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:14,921
But for us, only you think that Bible is the authority.

471
00:32:16,463 --> 00:32:19,953
It is. But even to understand that Bible,

472
00:32:20,161 --> 00:32:23,138
as I told you, to understand Gita you better get your Realization.

473
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:26,975
In the same way to understand that Bible also

474
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:31,625
you have to get your Realization.

475
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:37,063
The One about Whom

476
00:32:37,563 --> 00:32:40,540
it is described had never been to a school.

477
00:32:43,686 --> 00:32:45,686
None of them have been to any school.

478
00:32:46,186 --> 00:32:49,187
For the first time in this life I have learnt this English language.

479
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:52,493
I never knew this language in any one of my lives before.

480
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:55,514
Because I knew I have to talk to you.

481
00:32:56,347 --> 00:33:00,109
And I have to tell you about Spirit in this language.

482
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:07,703
But to understand it we have to read ancient scriptures.

483
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,986
Beautiful ancient scripture are there

484
00:33:10,277 --> 00:33:13,407
which describes the nature of the Spirit.

485
00:33:13,907 --> 00:33:19,660
It is said that Spirit has got three qualities. Satchitananda -

486
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,521
Sat, chit, Ananda. Sat means truth,

487
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:26,021
chit means attention.

488
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:28,086
Anand means joy.

489
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:32,949
Sat is the truth. What is the truth now?

490
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:37,805
If you see something white it is the truth, all right.

491
00:33:38,305 --> 00:33:40,305
But what is the truth of this shawl.

492
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,430
A realized soul can know

493
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:47,233
not you because his Spirit is enlightened.

494
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,755
He sees the fifth dimension of this shawl.

495
00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:55,084
Let him hold it in his hands and he will know that this is Mother's shawl.

496
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:59,547
Immediately he'll feel those cool vibrations coming out of it.

497
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,839
He'll know that this is Mother's shawl.

498
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:03,743
That is the truth.

499
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:07,354
The four dimensions, which we know of,

500
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:13,726
is not the truth but the fifth one which is the truth, which is the Spirit.

501
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:18,080
Sitting down here you can find out anybody

502
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,261
what is he suffering from what are his problems,

503
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:23,449
what are his chakras, it is absolute.

504
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:26,571
This knowledge is absolute.

505
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:30,633
If you have five or ten children who are realized

506
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:34,262
and if you tied her eyes

507
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:37,216
and ask them about a patient,

508
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:40,427
which is he suffering from, they will all raise their fingers

509
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,510
this or this or this

510
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,744
or all of them,

511
00:34:46,015 --> 00:34:47,271
whatever maybe the case.

512
00:34:47,306 --> 00:34:50,042
All of them will raise the same fingers

513
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:52,834
it is absolute knowledge.

514
00:34:54,355 --> 00:34:56,355
It cannot be argued.

515
00:34:57,188 --> 00:34:59,188
It cannot be refuted.

516
00:34:59,688 --> 00:35:01,688
It is what it is.

517
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:06,667
And also today the man may be having these

518
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,273
problems tomorrow he may not have at all.

519
00:35:10,377 --> 00:35:12,752
So then whatever was there is finished

520
00:35:12,835 --> 00:35:15,210
whatever is today that's what they are going to tell you,

521
00:35:16,793 --> 00:35:20,684
so this is the truth. The rest is all

522
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:26,109
is mithya, is false.

523
00:35:27,755 --> 00:35:32,603
I was once going in Kashmir

524
00:35:33,811 --> 00:35:37,514
driving through some very remote corner

525
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:42,064
and suddenly I felt tremendous vibrations in the air

526
00:35:43,522 --> 00:35:44,875
and I asked the driver

527
00:35:44,896 --> 00:35:46,710
"Is there any temple here or something?"

528
00:35:46,773 --> 00:35:51,301
because in Kashmir there are many temples which are vibrating.

529
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:55,350
So many things have come out of the Mother Earth,

530
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:57,413
as it said in the Ten Commandment

531
00:35:57,913 --> 00:35:59,814
that "Thou shalt not worship

532
00:35:59,835 --> 00:36:02,502
anything that is created by the Mother Earth,

533
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:07,472
reproduced and worshipped."

534
00:36:07,972 --> 00:36:10,740
There are many in Kashmir like that.

535
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,659
So, I asked him and he said "No there is no temple,

536
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
there are no Hindus live in this area.

537
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,577
I said but still I feel tremendous vibration

538
00:36:18,702 --> 00:36:21,546
so my husband told driver "All right, let's go the way she says."

539
00:36:21,963 --> 00:36:23,963
So, we followed about three miles

540
00:36:24,276 --> 00:36:27,037
and we reached a colony of people

541
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:28,975
who were Muslims living there.

542
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,626
When we asked, "Is there any temple here?",

543
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:36,753
he said, "No, but there is one great mosque."

544
00:36:36,982 --> 00:36:39,979
"What mosque is that?" called as "Hazrat Iqbal."

545
00:36:41,146 --> 00:36:44,948
That means one hair of Hazrat Mohammad Sahib

546
00:36:46,094 --> 00:36:48,524
of Mohammad Sahib one hair was there.

547
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:54,017
And even now to take His name, the vibrations start flowing.

548
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:56,121
How can I deny Him?

549
00:36:57,975 --> 00:36:59,414
He was the truth.

550
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:04,094
Spirit will not deny. It is the falsehood that denies

551
00:37:04,136 --> 00:37:05,662
all these real people.

552
00:37:06,162 --> 00:37:08,786
It is the Spirit, that

553
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:12,148
gives you the truth, which integrates all that is truth

554
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:16,312
and throws away that is untruth.

555
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:19,606
That's why you must get your Spirit.

556
00:37:20,294 --> 00:37:23,802
Before that anybody talks to you about God,

557
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:27,065
about anything they can even crucify.

558
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:30,186
They are such stupid foolish people

559
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,726
that they can do anything. They'll argue with you they'll

560
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:36,951
fight with you, they'll do all kinds of stupid things but

561
00:37:37,826 --> 00:37:39,826
understand you.

562
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:42,326
This is what my father told me

563
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:45,601
that you have to find out an en masse method,

564
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:49,312
method by which you give Realization to many people

565
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,274
so that they can see that there is something beyond.

566
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:55,774
They are all standing on the first floor

567
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,274
if you are born on the tenth floor

568
00:37:58,774 --> 00:38:01,970
and you tell them something that you see on the tenth floor,

569
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,999
they're not going to believe you, they will fight with you, they'll

570
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:07,041
quarrel with you, they'll pull you down

571
00:38:07,062 --> 00:38:09,062
because their ego is challenged all the time.

572
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:12,416
So best thing is to transform them,

573
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,249
give them en masse Realization.

574
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,520
That is what is the Spirit is

575
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:22,422
that every one of you have got Spirit

576
00:38:24,547 --> 00:38:29,296
but it was very difficult in those days to give en masse realization,

577
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:32,629
the blossom time had not come.

578
00:38:33,129 --> 00:38:35,297
Today the blossoms time has come.

579
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:39,029
And the wind that blows the cool wind

580
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:42,075
gives Realization to so many of them.

581
00:38:42,575 --> 00:38:46,066
Thousands of people have got Realization,

582
00:38:46,566 --> 00:38:49,269
you also many of you have got your Realization.

583
00:38:49,873 --> 00:38:52,589
So this Spirit is established, you feel

584
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:54,632
you are something different now.

585
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,726
The transformation has started, the baptism has

586
00:38:57,747 --> 00:38:59,747
been done in the actual sense.

587
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:03,725
and you start feeling its moving, you feel the cool breeze.

588
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:09,692
Now, when you take to your collective being, you become

589
00:39:09,796 --> 00:39:11,796
one with the others also.

590
00:39:12,671 --> 00:39:14,144
You try to give.

591
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:17,884
Now you are taking from me when I go, you stand here and give.

592
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:23,265
When the light, the lamp is not enlightened,

593
00:39:23,765 --> 00:39:25,765
then all right try to enlighten it.

594
00:39:25,786 --> 00:39:28,965
After enlightenment what does the light do, is to give the light.

595
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,236
Spirit gives you, your meaning.

596
00:39:35,278 --> 00:39:40,291
Spirit gives you your understanding

597
00:39:40,624 --> 00:39:45,063
of the truth that is reality not unreal things,

598
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:49,845
me you cannot understand if you are not Realized you cannot

599
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:54,373
I'm just like you, there is no difference.

600
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:59,814
But those who are Realized know about me very well.

601
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,125
Even living in Ramuln.

602
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:05,818
A saint who met one of the Sahaja yoginis, she was American,

603
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,860
and he just bowed to her

604
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,022
and made her sit higher than him and said, you have met Mother.

605
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:15,390
I have not yet met Her. And she was surprised

606
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,890
that how did you know all these things.

607
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,390
There are so many saints in India

608
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:23,971
who are real saints, who know about me.

609
00:40:24,471 --> 00:40:26,979
But those who are very close to me also,

610
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:30,797
because you know my husband is highly placed in life

611
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,605
and we have friends of very elite and very...

612
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:36,063
I have seen all prime ministers of the world,

613
00:40:36,084 --> 00:40:39,319
I've met them and I've met all sorts of kings and queens

614
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:42,250
and this and that and every day I am shaking hands with them.

615
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:47,942
They don't know me, they don't recognize me.

616
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:50,325
There was a gentleman who we knew very well

617
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,869
he is now the President of the High Court,

618
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,518
World High Court

619
00:40:59,397 --> 00:41:02,037
and, I mean, we knew him very well

620
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:03,863
a great friend of my husband's and all that,

621
00:41:04,149 --> 00:41:07,158
and suddenly he saw, his wife saw my photograph with

622
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:08,933
one of the Maharajas

623
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,967
place one of the Maharajas having in his pocket.

624
00:41:12,185 --> 00:41:15,175
So the Maharaja suddenly took it out the photograph and put it

625
00:41:15,169 --> 00:41:17,675
to his eyes and put it back. So she said what is this?

626
00:41:17,961 --> 00:41:19,961
Such and such lady, I know her very well.

627
00:41:20,014 --> 00:41:22,014
He said yes, but don't you know she is

628
00:41:22,085 --> 00:41:24,514
the Mataji, who has cured me of my heart trouble.

629
00:41:25,131 --> 00:41:27,713
She said, really? I didn't know she was a Mataji or anything.

630
00:41:28,213 --> 00:41:30,213
She comes to the party, she's very quiet.

631
00:41:30,713 --> 00:41:32,230
She just sits quietly.

632
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:34,245
I never even heard her speaking.

633
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:37,620
For the last 25 years I know, she speaks very little.

634
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:41,577
Oh God, she gives lectures and there are thousands of people.

635
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:43,054
Can she speak?

636
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:44,719
She was surprised.

637
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:47,664
We have never seen her speaking anything.

638
00:41:48,164 --> 00:41:50,624
I won't even be able to recognize her voice even

639
00:41:50,658 --> 00:41:54,056
my husband of course speaks a lot and her husband speaks

640
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:57,005
a lot, I also speak but I have never heard her speaking anything,

641
00:41:57,058 --> 00:42:00,295
she just keeps quiet, sometimes amusing to herself.

642
00:42:00,743 --> 00:42:03,364
She seems to be a dignified lady but otherwise

643
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:07,261
she never makes any efforts to impress us or anyway tell us that she is Mataji.

644
00:42:10,344 --> 00:42:15,163
Immediately the husband got such a shock

645
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:17,138
and he immediately telephoned to my husband,

646
00:42:17,153 --> 00:42:19,814
I never knew she was Mataji. It was such a thing.

647
00:42:19,848 --> 00:42:22,481
You knew I am a seeker, I'm a seeker, a seeker.

648
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,719
And he said that. So my husband said she's now in Delhi, go and meet her.

649
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:28,219
Immediately he sent for me.

650
00:42:28,408 --> 00:42:31,615
and he got his realization in five minutes,

651
00:42:31,843 --> 00:42:34,526
but his wife didn't get it. So he sent her back.

652
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:38,939
He sent her by plane, that you better get it.

653
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,621
This is the thing one has to get.

654
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:44,441
Now the emphasis

655
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,329
that you have to be your Spirit

656
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,140
is very much reduced

657
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:51,572
in the modern society.

658
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:58,231
Emphasis should be that your Spirit

659
00:42:58,731 --> 00:43:00,731
is to be achieved in this life time.

660
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:04,297
This is what one has to do, is the

661
00:43:04,564 --> 00:43:06,564
only thing one have to do,

662
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:09,064
that is not there in the western societies.

663
00:43:09,972 --> 00:43:13,268
Secondly for this you have to control your attention,

664
00:43:13,263 --> 00:43:15,263
don't allow your attention to spill out.

665
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,437
I hope I told you the story of

666
00:43:19,607 --> 00:43:22,535
Janaka did I tell them I do not know but I'll again repeat

667
00:43:23,773 --> 00:43:27,022
Like there was a Raja Janaka, the father of Sita

668
00:43:27,075 --> 00:43:29,075
father-in-law of Rama.

669
00:43:30,953 --> 00:43:32,526
And Narada went to him,

670
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,684
another celestial being, he went to see him and he said,

671
00:43:36,262 --> 00:43:39,035
"How is it, you are a king and you move about

672
00:43:39,112 --> 00:43:41,535
like a king, you have everything like a king,

673
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:43,550
you have gold and everything

674
00:43:43,603 --> 00:43:46,972
and how is it people say that you are [unclear]

675
00:43:47,064 --> 00:43:49,064
above all these things, above your body?

676
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:50,243
How is it?"

677
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:53,131
He said, "All right, I will tell you in the evening,

678
00:43:53,223 --> 00:43:54,570
but just now you do me a job.

679
00:43:54,701 --> 00:43:57,714
You carry some milk in this pot."

680
00:43:57,845 --> 00:43:59,390
The pot had no rim also.

681
00:43:59,754 --> 00:44:02,556
So poor fellow was carrying that.

682
00:44:03,755 --> 00:44:05,755
The whole day he was carrying got tired.

683
00:44:05,828 --> 00:44:08,314
He said don't allow even a drop to spill out.

684
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:09,940
He was looking at it all the time.

685
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,526
In the evening he got tired

686
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,970
and put it there and he said, "Now will you tell me,

687
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:15,983
I've had enough of this."

688
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:18,269
He said, "What did you see when you were moving about?"

689
00:44:18,944 --> 00:44:21,572
He said, "Nothing, what could I see? I was just watching

690
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,868
this milk that it should not spill out."

691
00:44:26,203 --> 00:44:28,203
He said, "In the same way

692
00:44:28,994 --> 00:44:32,637
I am at that stage where my attention does not spill out."

693
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,565
That is the state you are achieving

694
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:37,188
your Self-Realization,

695
00:44:37,688 --> 00:44:41,759
where the attention is completely enlightened by your Spirit.

696
00:44:42,259 --> 00:44:44,969
It doesn't envelope anything like that

697
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,809
and even if it goes round it comes back as it is.

698
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:52,262
My hand when it touches it, it doesn't become this metal, does it?

699
00:44:52,762 --> 00:44:54,762
It comes out.

700
00:44:55,578 --> 00:44:59,549
It's absolutely detached from this. I can touch it but I am not that.

701
00:45:00,312 --> 00:45:03,552
Just now I am matter. I am everything,

702
00:45:03,578 --> 00:45:06,056
I am worried about my children my house this thing,

703
00:45:06,214 --> 00:45:08,214
but when I become realized

704
00:45:08,714 --> 00:45:10,714
I get completely detached.

705
00:45:12,557 --> 00:45:14,557
I am a spiritual living being.

706
00:45:15,057 --> 00:45:18,623
Then nothing

707
00:45:19,782 --> 00:45:23,060
can keep you down, nothing can dominate you.

708
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:25,901
And you do not dominate anything.

709
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:33,402
That is the state of the Spirit. When that happens

710
00:45:35,535 --> 00:45:40,742
you become beyond dharma sustenance, you are beyond it.

711
00:45:43,376 --> 00:45:48,746
For example there is no temptation for such a person.

712
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,246
There's no temptation.

713
00:45:52,062 --> 00:45:54,062
There is no mental activity either

714
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:00,580
there is no stealing nor telling lies. Such a person is extremely

715
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,966
honest and fearless,

716
00:46:02,466 --> 00:46:05,039
like Christ. He had nothing to do with the prostitute.

717
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:08,521
I mean she was a different style, He was a different style.

718
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,455
But when people started stoning the prostitute

719
00:46:11,504 --> 00:46:13,128
He stood up before them and asked,

720
00:46:13,234 --> 00:46:15,323
who are the ones who have not committed the sin?

721
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:16,654
They could have stoned Him.

722
00:46:16,812 --> 00:46:19,730
This His honesty and His strength stopped it.

723
00:46:21,389 --> 00:46:24,142
They will stand by all those who are tortured

724
00:46:24,326 --> 00:46:27,552
and troubled by people who are oppressive.

725
00:46:27,947 --> 00:46:30,419
They are not afraid of anything. They are fearless people.

726
00:46:30,919 --> 00:46:33,953
Neither they frighten anyone. They are compassionate.

727
00:46:34,163 --> 00:46:36,163
But when it comes to protesting

728
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:40,909
they stand up fearlessly against those

729
00:46:41,014 --> 00:46:44,409
who try to torture and ruin others.

730
00:46:45,699 --> 00:46:49,345
There is no oppression. Even

731
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,835
I cannot force you to get Realization.

732
00:46:53,967 --> 00:46:57,122
I cannot argue it out with you. It has to work out.

733
00:46:57,438 --> 00:46:59,438
It is as simple as that.

734
00:46:59,517 --> 00:47:03,424
If you do not want it, you can never get it.

735
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,966
Out of question.

736
00:47:05,097 --> 00:47:08,454
So there is [unclear] as I say, if you do not want it, you better go away

737
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,523
But still some obstinate people will sit there. No, I'll sit here. For what?

738
00:47:14,525 --> 00:47:17,901
Such people also give out very bad vibrations to others

739
00:47:18,401 --> 00:47:21,800
and they disturb others getting their Realization, it is satanic.

740
00:47:24,302 --> 00:47:26,941
Still I make them sit all right sit down.

741
00:47:28,495 --> 00:47:30,495
You cannot force it.

742
00:47:30,995 --> 00:47:32,995
It's a light within you a flicker.

743
00:47:34,172 --> 00:47:38,614
And the analogy could be, like the gas.

744
00:47:39,661 --> 00:47:44,393
That rises and touches the flicker and the whole gas gets enlightened.

745
00:47:46,351 --> 00:47:49,660
The flicker is awake all the time and watching.

746
00:47:51,566 --> 00:47:53,566
Then the whole thing becomes the truth.

747
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:59,299
Truth is very different from what we know as truth.

748
00:48:01,335 --> 00:48:04,318
Is a new dimension, by which we know

749
00:48:04,558 --> 00:48:07,525
this is the truth and this is not the truth.

750
00:48:08,025 --> 00:48:11,135
You can ask any questions when you are

751
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:16,884
connected with your Spirit. Ask any question.

752
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,544
Ask the question about me.

753
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:21,409
Then ask the question about Christ,

754
00:48:21,909 --> 00:48:26,112
about Moses, about God. Ask any question.

755
00:48:27,211 --> 00:48:30,489
And when the answer is yes, you will get cool breeze coming into you.

756
00:48:30,989 --> 00:48:32,989
If you aks any negative questions,

757
00:48:33,489 --> 00:48:37,409
you lose your vibrations. Might get tingling, might get heat.

758
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:43,389
Because now your computer is connected with

759
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,763
the absolute and the rapport has been established of the truth.

760
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:51,619
This is a new awareness you get by which

761
00:48:53,395 --> 00:48:55,657
you become aware

762
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:01,713
of truth which is the vibratory awareness.

763
00:49:04,088 --> 00:49:06,428
Through vibrations a child also can know.

764
00:49:06,563 --> 00:49:08,563
There are many children who are born realized.

765
00:49:09,662 --> 00:49:11,662
And they know where is the Kundalini.

766
00:49:12,162 --> 00:49:15,384
They know. They will tell you where is the Kundalini.

767
00:49:15,884 --> 00:49:17,107
It's the truth.

768
00:49:17,737 --> 00:49:20,617
Because they know the truth. For that you don't need

769
00:49:20,622 --> 00:49:23,197
too much of mental development.

770
00:49:26,353 --> 00:49:28,353
They are very dignified.

771
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:33,543
They understand it better than many elderly people and

772
00:49:33,626 --> 00:49:37,166
people who are placed very highly in life.

773
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:38,939
Christ has already said

774
00:49:39,048 --> 00:49:43,224
that rich men are not going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

775
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,856
He has already said because they are running.

776
00:49:45,913 --> 00:49:48,682
But I would say even those who think they know a lot,

777
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:51,052
all knowing, they will not enter.

778
00:49:55,875 --> 00:49:57,875
Because they do not want to enter.

779
00:49:57,958 --> 00:50:01,499
They know everything. They do not want to enter inside.

780
00:50:02,442 --> 00:50:06,811
They want to carry their mind everywhere.

781
00:50:08,274 --> 00:50:10,981
They want to carry their car inside the hall.

782
00:50:12,106 --> 00:50:14,106
How they will enter inside?

783
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,633
They are not willing to keep their mind outside

784
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:22,004
because they are always dependent on that mind

785
00:50:22,218 --> 00:50:24,218
which has given them nothing.

786
00:50:24,718 --> 00:50:31,565
But to achieve Spirit you have to come there ego-lessly, to receive.

787
00:50:32,065 --> 00:50:34,888
The light of your being

788
00:50:35,388 --> 00:50:39,177
is going to enlighten the whole thing. Your temple.

789
00:50:40,146 --> 00:50:42,146
And when this light comes in,

790
00:50:43,688 --> 00:50:45,688
when this line shines in you,

791
00:50:46,891 --> 00:50:51,598
then you can feel your collective consciousness, you can feel it,

792
00:50:51,655 --> 00:50:54,730
the cool breeze of the Spirit manifesting through you,

793
00:50:56,584 --> 00:51:00,825
is described in the Bible in very short but deep.

794
00:51:01,716 --> 00:51:05,765
But, Adi Shankaracharya has written such a big book,

795
00:51:06,035 --> 00:51:08,265
one is called as Saundarya Lahiri

796
00:51:08,296 --> 00:51:09,663
or Chaitanya Lahiri.

797
00:51:11,882 --> 00:51:16,798
It is not easy to talk about all these in such a short time.

798
00:51:19,694 --> 00:51:23,617
He wrote treaties of philosophy.

799
00:51:24,117 --> 00:51:26,117
Great personality he was

800
00:51:27,841 --> 00:51:31,092
called as Vivekachudamani. First of all he gave

801
00:51:31,201 --> 00:51:35,357
conscious the call. Where is your conscience? Vivekachudamani.

802
00:51:35,857 --> 00:51:39,637
Then he wrote many books and

803
00:51:39,772 --> 00:51:42,968
ultimately he wrote Saundarya Lahiri.

804
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:47,192
In that he says it's only the description of the beauty

805
00:51:47,248 --> 00:51:49,248
of my Mother I can describe

806
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,587
and in all details he has described nothing but The Mother.

807
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:55,431
Her fingers, Her hands, Her movements and

808
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:58,717
everything and what he saw how the vibrations move in Her,

809
00:51:58,878 --> 00:52:01,937
every words that She speaks.

810
00:52:03,374 --> 00:52:06,673
You have to read that book to understand Sahaja Yoga.

811
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:10,631
It's very clearly given all these things.

812
00:52:11,626 --> 00:52:15,205
As I told you the other day, William Blake also has written about Sahaja Yoga

813
00:52:15,262 --> 00:52:17,262
very clearly.

814
00:52:17,996 --> 00:52:20,472
But unless and until you have Realization

815
00:52:20,842 --> 00:52:25,661
you cannot know the truth. So He's the truth, "Sat".

816
00:52:26,161 --> 00:52:30,101
Then is "Chit" is attention, He's the attention.

817
00:52:30,184 --> 00:52:32,184
Your Spirit is the attention.

818
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:34,970
Attention of God.

819
00:52:36,616 --> 00:52:39,407
God is attentive to you through your Spirit

820
00:52:39,595 --> 00:52:42,424
and when your attention is enlightened by Him

821
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:44,615
that means you've come in the attention of God.

822
00:52:46,235 --> 00:52:50,186
You are looked after by God. All His powers flow into you.

823
00:52:51,103 --> 00:52:53,103
All His protection comes to you.

824
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:56,221
You will be amazed there will here Sahaja yogis will tell you.

825
00:52:56,566 --> 00:52:58,721
How they avoided accidents,

826
00:52:59,221 --> 00:53:01,221
what happened after accidents

827
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:04,596
and miraculously how people are saved.

828
00:53:05,955 --> 00:53:09,987
It is nothing new to me. It is the minimum that can happen to a person.

829
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:14,049
This is the minimum of minimum,

830
00:53:14,549 --> 00:53:17,542
because all the angels they take charge.

831
00:53:17,651 --> 00:53:21,757
You are on the stage, the angels are there to look after you.

832
00:53:22,127 --> 00:53:26,316
And you really start gradually feeling the presence of that blessing

833
00:53:26,816 --> 00:53:28,816
which is the attention of God.

834
00:53:29,316 --> 00:53:33,047
So He's the "Chit". " Sat", "Chit" and "Anand" He is the joy.

835
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:35,547
He is the joy.

836
00:53:39,172 --> 00:53:41,172
Because God is joy.

837
00:53:42,193 --> 00:53:44,193
He created this universe

838
00:53:44,693 --> 00:53:47,525
not to make us serious and unhappy and sulky.

839
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:52,189
See how many flowers, how many beautiful things,

840
00:53:52,194 --> 00:53:55,523
how many colors what He has created for us.

841
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:59,899
For us to enjoy He has created all this not to indulge into nonsense,

842
00:54:00,399 --> 00:54:02,399
into filth, into dirt,

843
00:54:06,102 --> 00:54:08,102
the dirt of the mind, the sin

844
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:11,045
the filthy ideas.

845
00:54:15,243 --> 00:54:17,243
But to have a clean heart

846
00:54:17,951 --> 00:54:21,238
and to have a clean morality within us.

847
00:54:24,863 --> 00:54:28,361
He has created this beautiful world for us to enjoy

848
00:54:28,392 --> 00:54:31,495
without that you cannot enjoy, you cannot enjoy

849
00:54:32,281 --> 00:54:35,258
unless and until you have a clean morality within you,

850
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:37,341
you cannot enjoy yourself.

851
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:41,950
And that joy is your own

852
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,450
once you get your Realization.

853
00:54:46,278 --> 00:54:50,092
This joy is the compassion and grace of God.

854
00:54:50,436 --> 00:54:52,436
When the Kundalini first rises

855
00:54:53,379 --> 00:54:55,379
through one small little thread,

856
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:57,879
She touches the Brahmarandra here,

857
00:54:59,134 --> 00:55:01,134
just one thread.

858
00:55:01,217 --> 00:55:03,882
She opens and the grace and joy.

859
00:55:04,382 --> 00:55:06,382
Because here is the seat

860
00:55:06,882 --> 00:55:11,110
of Sadashiva, here is the seat of your Spirit.

861
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:16,289
When it touches the Spirit, that seat, the flow

862
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,956
of the grace starts coming

863
00:55:18,196 --> 00:55:20,934
on your sympathetic nervous system and you feel relaxed.

864
00:55:20,991 --> 00:55:22,991
First thing happens to you you feel relaxed.

865
00:55:23,231 --> 00:55:26,502
Is the grace. Only one thread has reached

866
00:55:28,018 --> 00:55:32,612
and then the flow that is flowing today this one is the Brahma

867
00:55:34,674 --> 00:55:38,300
is the power of God flowing through you.

868
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:43,138
This is what you have to get.

869
00:55:44,185 --> 00:55:48,101
This is what you've to remember, somebody touched Christ and the power went.

870
00:55:51,179 --> 00:55:53,179
For us

871
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:59,019
it is necessary to know that we are the first Australians to get Realization.

872
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:02,274
You are the first people to get it.

873
00:56:03,139 --> 00:56:05,997
And it's a great responsibility on you,

874
00:56:06,132 --> 00:56:10,053
all of you who have got Realization today and before,

875
00:56:11,074 --> 00:56:12,628
to keep it strong.

876
00:56:12,711 --> 00:56:16,099
Make it into a tree, because you are responsible for

877
00:56:16,156 --> 00:56:19,142
all the progeny that is going to come to this

878
00:56:19,173 --> 00:56:22,475
beautiful land of yours by which you are blessed.

879
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:28,481
So this is the beautiful place

880
00:56:28,721 --> 00:56:31,913
and beautiful people. So many children of mine.

881
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,197
Today is the last day.

882
00:56:36,572 --> 00:56:41,592
It's a very sad thing that one has to say good-bye.

883
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:46,400
I hope you all will make it convenient to come and see me on Sunday.

884
00:56:46,692 --> 00:56:48,692
I'll be looking forward to you.

885
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,463
Here I will try to cure you also

886
00:56:51,546 --> 00:56:54,858
if you have any problems, but don't bring all the hospitals there.

887
00:56:57,233 --> 00:57:01,413
I will teach you how to cure and how to give realization.

888
00:57:01,913 --> 00:57:05,182
Best thing is you bring the case to me and I will tell you how to

889
00:57:05,265 --> 00:57:08,539
cure yourself because if you are realized souls, you can cure also.

890
00:57:09,247 --> 00:57:11,247
We always in India do,

891
00:57:11,304 --> 00:57:13,304
when a cancer patient comes in, we call

892
00:57:13,335 --> 00:57:17,626
one of his relations, give him Realization, teach him how to cure cancer

893
00:57:17,709 --> 00:57:19,709
and he looks after the patient.

894
00:57:20,209 --> 00:57:23,552
Because that's the best way one can do it.

895
00:57:23,557 --> 00:57:25,634
He can give Realization,

896
00:57:25,665 --> 00:57:28,195
to that person he can look after better,

897
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,835
he knows the person better

898
00:57:29,996 --> 00:57:33,025
and it works out much better that way.

899
00:57:34,228 --> 00:57:37,157
So I hope you'll make it convenient to come and see me.

900
00:57:37,266 --> 00:57:40,857
I must say, I was very much impressed by Sydney people

901
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:46,212
who have been so kind to come here and listen and get their Realization.

902
00:57:46,842 --> 00:57:48,842
I have to say that

903
00:57:49,342 --> 00:57:51,342
because I am a mother.

904
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:54,622
I cannot just leave it to your senses.

905
00:57:55,122 --> 00:57:57,695
I have to ask, I have to request you.

906
00:57:58,586 --> 00:58:02,093
I have to be very, very patient with you, extremely patient

907
00:58:02,723 --> 00:58:05,595
and loving so that you listen to me

908
00:58:05,835 --> 00:58:08,527
and take your Realization. I have to actually

909
00:58:08,584 --> 00:58:10,584
go to you to do that.

910
00:58:10,615 --> 00:58:13,900
It's all right, that is mother's job, only mother can do it.

911
00:58:13,983 --> 00:58:15,983
When Christ will come, He will take His

912
00:58:17,238 --> 00:58:19,660
eleven powers and He will just sort you out.

913
00:58:19,821 --> 00:58:24,276
Before that please have yourself completely judged

914
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:27,577
through your own Kundalini awakening and work it out.

915
00:58:28,441 --> 00:58:31,301
Those people who have came with ideas

916
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:32,498
of their own should

917
00:58:32,529 --> 00:58:36,187
just go and see for themselves what they have achieved by these

918
00:58:37,338 --> 00:58:38,540
ideas.

919
00:58:38,571 --> 00:58:41,985
There have been so many organizations, one after another.

920
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:45,273
There is no way to organize God.

921
00:58:45,487 --> 00:58:47,487
Better organize yourself

922
00:58:47,622 --> 00:58:50,356
through your Spirit, which is the absolute.

923
00:58:52,054 --> 00:58:54,093
May God Bless You!
