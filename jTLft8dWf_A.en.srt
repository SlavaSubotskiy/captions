1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:10,878
It was astounding the way, today, Debuji played
so well.

2
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:14,120
Every time you hear him, there’s

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:23,689
such a variety and such deep understanding
of the principle of music.

4
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:34,412
And the principle of music is that it should entertain the Spirit.

5
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:48,682
You being Sahaja Yogis and most of you have never learnt any Indian music as such like Me.

6
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:59,754
But it’s a fact that Indian music comes from Omkara,

7
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:05,506
from the Divine source of sound.

8
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:17,872
And that’s why that can first entertains, amuses the Spirit.

9
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:24,758
Otherwise, the Spirit is so self-satisfied by itself.

10
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:28,853
It enjoys itself.

11
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:37,057
But with music and art, I feel it gets its reflection to see,

12
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:46,007
reflects its own beautiful existence.

13
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:56,601
It is permeating into every little particle, into every molecule, into every atom.

14
00:01:56,601 --> 00:02:06,774
And that reflection, when the Spirit sees,  it has that new dimension of a beautiful

15
00:02:06,774 --> 00:02:15,753
expansion of its personality. And, as if you feel you are resounding in the whole universe.

16
00:02:15,912 --> 00:02:22,671
It’s the beauty of Indian music is this, especially with Debu [Chaudhuri],

17
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:28,220
I’m very grateful to him that he has come here with
his son Prateek whom I’ve seen as a little boy.

18
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:34,013
And it’s so heartening to see that he has taken this art so seriously. Normally these days,

19
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:42,639
 young boys do not take to art much. And that he should learn from his father! That’s even a greater thing!

20
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:54,167
That we have such delicate weaving and such strong strokes of depth from Debu.

21
00:02:54,167 --> 00:03:04,728
And he is creating mirth, affecting like stars [unsure] creating mirth from Debu was something, we can say,

22
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:13,401
 like some of the very, very senior sages ever. They were playing some sort of a hymn.

23
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:22,112
It was a beautiful combination of both father and son. I bless them from my heart

24
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:28,855
for giving us such a beautiful feeling of expansion within ourselves of our “jivan”.

25
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:36,030
Then we have Saumna, Saumnaji. He is a very good artist and he’s so well played today.

26
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:42,647
So much in concord and understanding with both of them.

27
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:44,960
 It was such a beautiful try.

28
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,171
I’m really thankful to him that they came all the way from India to play for us here.

29
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:55,455
And Devuji is a Realized soul, his son is a Realized soul, they are all Realized souls.

30
00:03:55,455 --> 00:04:03,759
It's the rapport between them and you, was so beautifully done. I mean, it is not possible to describe the joy

31
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:14,491
the “ananda” that you felt with this. Only, one can say that the collectivity of enjoyment

32
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:18,264
one can have through this kind of music.

33
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:24,824
I hope some of you also pick up from this, dedicate yourself to this art of music

34
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:34,648
because for a Realized soul it is very easy to go
further with it and to progress with it, though it’s a big tapasya.

35
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:42,509
Indian music is not an easy thing. It’s a great dedication, concentration and grievance,

36
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:46,361
otherwise you do not work it out.

37
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:56,233
I’m happy that there are some Sahaja Yogis who are now taking lessons in tabla  and also in classical music.

38
00:04:56,452 --> 00:05:05,174
And the way our Sahaja Yogis sing is something remarkable

39
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:12,495
that even the Maharashtrians actors and actresses who sing very well had come to a program

40
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:21,019
 and they said that, “We really felt ashamed of ourselves the way the Sahaja Yogis were singing Marathi songs and the way they were

41
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:27,249
so beautifully, rhythmically bind and how they put us together with them.”

42
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:36,761
So, it’s a very beautiful net that binds us together for our collectivity, for our delicate feelings,

43
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:42,941
and how we should be with each other, like the music.

44
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:57,115
Because the notes were very deep, very deep, touching your heart and were spreading a kind of a

45
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,601
light of love in your heart.

46
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:03,460
And that touches each other’s heart.

47
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:11,869
And that’s what should be the understanding of music that it should really reach our heart.

48
00:06:11,869 --> 00:06:21,027
And through our heart, we should try to feel other people, their depth and their wisdom,

49
00:06:21,027 --> 00:06:31,400
their understanding and a kind of a beautiful anxiety to please others, to make others happy,

50
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,818
to entertain them.

51
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:37,708
And the little Prateek, I’m so happy! Prateek means “symbol”, you know, he is a symbol of music.

52
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:41,868
I hope he comes up very well and gets a very big name in the whole world.

53
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:46,857
And now Saumna, these are real boys coming up and they should keep it up.

54
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:54,651
I feel so very, very happy about the way of young people are taking to music

55
00:06:54,651 --> 00:07:02,909
and especially, if Sahaja Yogis take to this music, it will be a very, very

56
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:09,319
demanding thing today because Indian music is now being neglected very much

57
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,752
by the younger generations in India. It’s a very sad thing that is happening.

58
00:07:14,752 --> 00:07:23,639
But for that, we have to know that a balanced personality has to be achieved.

59
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,211
You have to have creativity. Creativity is there, of course,

60
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:35,875
works out. Through your Kundalini, the creativity comes up but you must have the technic to express it.

61
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:43,704
And the third thing is the sweetness, the understanding

62
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:46,909
or I would say the report with the audience.

63
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:51,075
Where to pull, which string, that we call the ‘kalis’ [black notes].

64
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:59,765
And especially, his notes are not full, they are two missing I think in his sitar which I saw.

65
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:07,137
Without that how on his own sitar he can play! And the son, also, has a good way

66
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:12,238
of playing with three fingers, I saw it was a different style.

67
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:17,378
It’ll be very appealing to you people because that creates mirth.

68
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,714
So, we should go to the essence of it and see for ourselves

69
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:28,407
and not worry as to what is the ‘taala’, what is the raga, what is this. That’s not for us, for Sahaja Yogis.

70
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:34,730
We have to just enjoy it without reacting to it, in thoughtless awareness.

71
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:42,159
Just enjoy the whole creativity, not to worry too much about what is the raga is, what is the note is.

72
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,806
Now, for example, he played a very, I would say, a very neat type of [inaudible].

73
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,666
He’s brought everything, every style like ‘tapasya’ was also there a little bit, that we saw.

74
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,197
It is- I’ve never heard such a thing before.

75
00:08:58,197 --> 00:09:05,082
So, it’s a very unique style of creating like this

76
00:09:05,082 --> 00:09:08,944
and as long as you are creating newer and newer things,

77
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:20,000
without compromising with the, say, our system of raga type,

78
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,462
means, you see, it should be in raga.

79
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:26,915
“Ra” comes from “energy”, “ga” means “which moves” you see.

80
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:35,206
And also, the Divine Mother’s protection is called as "raga and chala"

81
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:43,500
means, you see, the energy which moves in such a subtle and beautiful manner

82
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,814
that it gives you a protection.

83
00:09:46,814 --> 00:09:53,372
And in that protection, your dimensions touch the heavens. It’s like that.

84
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:59,963
And this is created, this raga and chala is created by our music.

85
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:12,098
The lilt and the rhythm, these are all factors which are so balanced

86
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:19,500
that unless and until you have a balanced personality, you cannot understand it.

87
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:26,193
Here, our eyes are towards the sky, we are looking at the stars walking.

88
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:32,429
And here, our feet are on the Mother Earth in such a beautiful manner.

89
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:38,166
If you hear this music, then you will know what it is. To Me, it’s heavenly.

90
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:46,772
And I’m very thankful to you, Debu, very much thankful my child, and really and you fill Me

91
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:50,782
My, my, my case, it’s my honour.

92
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:53,170
To say all this is too much for you.

93
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,071
Thank you to mean.

94
00:10:54,071 --> 00:11:01,284
You see, it’s a- if my love can really create all this,

95
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:07,987
I’m thankful to this love that has done all this good work for all of you.

96
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:09,293
May God bless you.
