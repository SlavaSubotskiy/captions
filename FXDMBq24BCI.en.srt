1
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:14,631
Doctor Warren has clearly told you about these
subtle bodies within us.

2
00:00:15,657 --> 00:00:21,750
And we should think why this subtle body was
created?

3
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,150
What was the need to create this body within us
and how it was created?

4
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:36,748
These, all these centers, are the milestones
of our evolution.

5
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:46,627
And as we started growing, higher and higher,
developing higher and higher awareness, we

6
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:49,649
developed all these centers one by one.

7
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:56,120
And at the human level, it’s this center
where the man raised his head up.

8
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,409
Still why?

9
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:01,800
What was the need to create a human being?

10
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,500
Supposing I’m trying to get some nuts, bolts
and things, and try to fix them up,

11
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:11,190
make it into a good instrument.

12
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,450
One would ask what are you doing?

13
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,310
Why are you assembling all this, what are
you making out of it?

14
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:24,469
After all, it cannot be a waste, why such
a special thing has been made, for what purpose?

15
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:29,520
And that is what we have not yet discovered,
what is our purpose.

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,541
But if you go to any of the Scriptures, you’ll
find out that they have said,

17
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:39,549
all of them have said, that you have to become your Self.

18
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:44,450
That there is All-pervading Power around us.

19
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,280
Now this All-pervading Power we cannot see.

20
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,220
It exists.

21
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,229
As they say, if you have to believe it, or
not.

22
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,120
But we should find out if there is such a
Power or not.

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:03,652
For example, if I say that there are lots of
beautiful pictures

24
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:09,090
and beautiful music in this area, you won’t believe it.

25
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:16,430
But if I get you a television set and if I
plug it to the main, you starts seeing

26
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,000
that it is receiving something.

27
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:27,632
In the same way, when you become connected
with the whole,

28
00:02:28,512 --> 00:02:34,830
then what should happen to you is that you start feeling that All-pervading Power.

29
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,140
This is Self-knowledge.

30
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:46,140
And it’s written at length, very clearly,
by many people in the Indian Scriptures.

31
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:55,799
The reason was, the people who came in the
other parts of the world,

32
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:03,681
had such a tough time, they were not given any chance to say
anything much about it.

33
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:12,430
Hardly they could utter anything and they
were crucified, poisoned, beaten up, tortured,

34
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,930
all kinds of problems they were given.

35
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:25,044
So this has to happen within us that you we
should feel this All-pervading Power.

36
00:03:26,435 --> 00:03:30,580
The other day, we had 2 persons from a guru
and they said,

37
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,827
 "How can it be only this cool breeze that is coming in us, is something?"

38
00:03:35,827 --> 00:03:41,928
For a human being, to conceive something about
God,

39
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:50,000
is to go to scriptures which have lasted for all these ages, to find out

40
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:53,355
one of the authorities you can have.

41
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:58,390
Now, it is said that there is All-pervading
power in all the scriptures.

42
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:05,639
Now supposing, by going to somebody, he says,
"I give you power called, so called shaktipat",

43
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:12,343
and he just starts jumping like a mad horse
or a like a mad monkey.

44
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:15,640
And you say, "It is shaktipat!"

45
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,995
And you have vigorous movements and all kinds
of acrobats you fall into

46
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:23,070
and you believe that this is shakti.

47
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,068
And then, by the time it is over, you are
exhausted and finished.

48
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:31,259
How can that be a shaktipat?

49
00:04:32,432 --> 00:04:40,834
The idea of energy within us is not horse
energy by which a horse can run very fast,

50
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:45,039
that’s physical energy, we should understand. 
That's just a 'prana shakti',

51
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:50,000
part of this- just part of this path.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,191
It’s just a physical energy.

53
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,210
Now human beings don’t need a horse power,
do they?

54
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,810
You have already got big cars here which have
tremendous horse powers.

55
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,760
You don’t have to become horses now, or
bulls or some sort of an animal.

56
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:15,129
Our idea of a Superman is that he will have
such power

57
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:18,993
that he can lift the whole building and throw away somewhere.

58
00:05:18,993 --> 00:05:24,040
All such absurd ideas should be given up 

59
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,875
and you should understand that is physical wellbeing

60
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:38,760
so that you can feel the blessings, the
blessings of your Spirit.

61
00:05:40,226 --> 00:05:48,139
Blessing work, an animal doesn’t understand;
but a human being must understand that when

62
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:57,070
he gets spiritually endowed and spiritually
blessed, then, first thing he should have

63
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,590
is a physical wellbeing.

64
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:07,920
That doesn’t mean that he becomes a wrestler,
That doesn’t mean that his body will be

65
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,919
so built that if he slaps somebody, then the
other person will die.

66
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:21,510
On the contrary, you become such a powerful
personality that if somebody slaps him, for

67
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,250
him it’s nothing, it is all nonsense.

68
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:36,290
So the concept of human beings can be from
the kind of life they lead, the kind of media

69
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:43,190
they face, the kind of identification the
society has, all kinds of things could be there.

70
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:50,000
For example, for Japanese children, I was
amazed, for them the idea of a Superman is

71
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,124
that he should look like a ghost, he should
at least ten times bigger than a normal human being.

72
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,550
And that’s what they think they should achieve.

73
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:06,620
Because I studied their media, specially their
cinema, and most of them have produced these phantom ideas.

74
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,316
We don’t become phantoms, that is one thing
one should know.

75
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:17,940
Neither we become agitated – how can we
become agitated? We are in bliss and peace.

76
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:28,685
If you start just gesticulating and sort of shouting
 and screaming like mad, then how can that be a 'shaktipat''?

77
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:33,202
It’s madness, you are possessed!
It's possession on you.

78
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:38,760
Anywhere you go anybody who’s possessed, you
go and see lunatics, they do the same.

79
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:45,404
You pay these people to become lunatics, to
believe that they have given you a power,

80
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,284
it’s absurd.

81
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:54,398
Now the power that has come, is going to come
to us, has to give you a wellbeing.

82
00:07:54,398 --> 00:07:58,163
All these people if you look at them, they
are sickly people, they are reclusive.

83
00:07:58,163 --> 00:08:03,808
They are actually frightened, some of them are
even frightened of a garlic as I told you.

84
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:12,258
So the Realization, if it comes to you, the
chakras which are placed on your fingers,

85
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,935
should be enlightened, minimum of minimum.

86
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:19,414
And that you should be able to feel this All-pervading Power that is there.

87
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:24,519
This is Self-knowledge, this is 'atma bodha'.

88
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:32,774
'Bodha' means to know; to know, to feel that
power.

89
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:35,316
Even, after Realization  [...]

90
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:41,365
when you grow a little bit more,
 you start seeing comma like powers,

91
00:08:41,365 --> 00:08:52,553
 it’s just like, you can say a – in
English I don’t know- small sparklers of commas,

92
00:08:52,553 --> 00:08:57,048
 you can see it clearly. You can also see the Kundalinis of the people.

93
00:08:57,048 --> 00:09:04,780
You can also see a good soul and a bad soul like dots, you can clearly start seeing, once you get your Realization,

94
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,455
 when you are at that level, you start seeing.

95
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:10,812
But if you get possessed, say you are on the
left-hand side, then what will you see?

96
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:13,618
You’ll see ghosts walking into your house.

97
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:15,880
You’ll say your room is lifted up.

98
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,000
Suddenly you’ll find your body is taken
away and you are somewhere hanging.

99
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,164
All these are very, very dangerous things
about which people are not aware.

100
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:29,202
Never go near these things and these people.

101
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:34,001
Recently there’s a big disease that has
started, which is a very dangerous disease

102
00:09:34,001 --> 00:09:37,304
I don’t know if you people, are aware of
it or not.

103
00:09:37,304 --> 00:09:42,359
That when small children are sleeping in the
day time, say they are in Switzerland.

104
00:09:44,313 --> 00:09:48,444
And say, their mother may be in America.

105
00:09:48,444 --> 00:09:50,320
The timings are different.

106
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,930
That time, it may be the night and here it
may be the day time.

107
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,940
And the mother goes to a clairvoyant and says
that: “I would like to speak to my child”.

108
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,000
“All right”.

109
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So the child is sleeping and this clairvoyant
gets a soul around, and asks the soul to get the soul of the child

110
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:16,490
and the mother can hear the voice of the child,
 sitting down here.

111
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:22,959
“Oh, I’m speaking without any telecommunication
I’m talking to this child”.

112
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:29,899
And it’s very common that the child dies
in sleep and the mother doesn’t know.

113
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:38,298
Because the soul has to return, and if it
does not return properly,

114
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:44,287
if something goes wrong in his return, the child suffers and also,

115
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:53,828
the soul suffers in any case when
it leaves the body and it is very dangerous to human life

116
00:10:53,828 --> 00:11:00,880
And we go headlong into it and we destroy
ourselves.

117
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,673
They are very, very cunning people I tell
you.

118
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:10,000
Yesterday, those two people who were discussing
me, arguing with me, they told me that their guru

119
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
thinks very highly of me.

120
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,381
And there also, people have heard they told me that our guru said that, You don’t go to Her

121
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:24,107
because She will only accept you if you are absolutely purified and we have to purify you".

122
00:11:24,107 --> 00:11:26,732
All this is nonsense!

123
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:34,568
These people are just playing tricks on your
mind. The purification takes when the Kundalini
rises.

124
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,368
She purifies you.

125
00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:41,162
Because you come to know about yourself when
the Kundalini rises, face the problem.

126
00:11:41,638 --> 00:11:44,704
And once you know the problem you correct
yourselves.

127
00:11:45,058 --> 00:11:50,259
Kundalini awakening gives you the judgement
of your own Self

128
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:54,018
as if you are going in the car

129
00:11:54,018 --> 00:12:00,000
 and you get out of the car to see what’s
wrong with the car.

130
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:05,473
It is very simple when the Kundalini rises
to correct you.

131
00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:09,162
For example, supposing there’s a person
who smokes too much.

132
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,233
I may tell him, "Don’t smoke, don’t smoke", all that.

133
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:17,628
He gets tired of me, run away, won’t see me again.

134
00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:20,407
There is no need to tell you don’t smoke.

135
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:24,130
Once you get your Self-realization, you won’t
smoke at all.

136
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,079
Little willpower will work it out,  in the
first instance.

137
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:34,565
But even if it doesn’t act in the first instance,
gradually you will just drop it out

138
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:38,149
because of transmutation that takes place.

139
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:43,905
So we have to see that when we say that we
have got some sort of a shakti or a power within us,

140
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:55,474
we should become master of ourselves,
of our greed, of our desires and of our aggressive nature.

141
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,206
We should become the master of that.

142
00:12:58,206 --> 00:13:02,895
Unless and until that happens to us, how should
we believe that it is innate power?

143
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:07,128
and that we should feel this All-pervading, blissful
Power around us.

144
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:11,445
Unless and until you’re awakened to that,
how can you see?

145
00:13:11,445 --> 00:13:15,960
Unless and until you eyes are open, how will
you see that?

146
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,000
And that awakening is enlightenment.

147
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,822
Now you are so beautifully made inside see,
already you are made like that.

148
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:27,614
Already you are made like that.

149
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:36,858
Except that if you are not ruining it, by breaking
it completely, you are there!

150
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:46,222
His made, for which you have not paid anything.
 You are putting no effort, no jumping, nothing.

151
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:53,143
You have become a human being from a monkey,
without cutting your tails.

152
00:13:53,143 --> 00:13:55,993
Automatically, spontaneously.

153
00:13:55,993 --> 00:14:04,353
And if you have to become anything higher, you will become, spontaneously.

154
00:14:04,353 --> 00:14:13,696
The only difference is that, at this stage
of evolution, you have been given your freedom to chose.

155
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:19,053
Because at a high level when you will move,
you have to be free people.

156
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:23,573
And that freedom is to be respected this is one point.

157
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:30,495
And the second point is that your Realization
has to take place in your human awareness,

158
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,025
you should know!

159
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:36,161
When you became a human being from a monkey stage, you never knew how you became.

160
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:38,746
But now you must know!

161
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:45,222
Because you must know that there is God 
and you must know that his power is flowing to you.

162
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:54,007
That’s why one should understand what we
should expect when we get our Realization.

163
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:58,852
Of course, as we said, that when you start
getting the power within you,

164
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:05,656
once it starts working, then you can learn about it, how
you manifest it, how you use it.

165
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:10,933
First, when electricity was discovered, nobody
knew that it will have so many uses.

166
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:15,360
But then you discover how many uses it has!

167
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,713
But here, you don’t even have to discover it.

168
00:15:19,713 --> 00:15:25,639
If it is told that this has this use, you
just try and see for yourself, it has or not.

169
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:31,709
It’s like, you get, say, a car, you purchase
a car and they give you everything in writing,

170
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:37,190
"Now try this one. If you press this button, that will
happen. If you  press that button, that will happen."

171
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,160
In the same way, the whole thing is invented

172
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,880
completely decorated for you to use this power

173
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:55,961
to manoeuvre it, to handle it and to manifest it.

174
00:15:58,307 --> 00:16:06,692
We have no self-esteem. If we had self-esteem, we should understand that

175
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:11,429
God has created you with such difficulties, whatever it is

176
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:18,296
Thousands of times, thousands of years it
has taken for you to become a human being.

177
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:25,085
And that you must be something special, much
higher than animals, no doubt about it;

178
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:28,966
and that it should happen to you.

179
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:34,102
It is He who loves you. It is He who is the father.

180
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:41,660
His compassion, love and the greatest father
that you could think of, who wants to share.

181
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,333
He wants to give his kingdom to you.

182
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:50,080
You must have that self-esteem that you are a human being.

183
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:58,364
I think somehow, perhaps, because of these conditionings you have had,

184
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:03,840
you think, “How can we get Realization so easily?” 
You can’t believe it.

185
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:09,836
You don’t want to believe it. 
You think, ‘How can we be Realized so easily?”

186
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:14,900
Because everything you do in life, you think
you have to struggle.

187
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,134
But there are so many things you don’t do with struggle; 

188
00:17:19,134 --> 00:17:22,107
like, you get a fruit without any struggle. 

189
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:26,457
Even if you breath, all your autonomous nervous system works without any struggle. 

190
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:30,353
You eat and the food is digested automatically. 

191
00:17:30,353 --> 00:17:35,824
You don’t have to struggle for it, you don’t have to jump or do jogging or anything like that.

192
00:17:35,824 --> 00:17:39,188
It just works out. 

193
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:47,355
We should understand it is the blessing, it’s the blessing.

194
00:17:47,355 --> 00:17:56,588
People have become so much science oriented that they have forgotten that science also is a blessing. 

195
00:17:56,588 --> 00:18:01,041
Science is a blessing now, for example, 
see this photograph of mine here. 

196
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:07,779
I had gone to a village and the village, which had no electricity, nothing, 

197
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:12,309
had a very old building of a school, I was sitting outside. 

198
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:19,019
And the photograph caught on these falling rains,
the photograph! 

199
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:21,410
Your camera has caught it. 

200
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:28,016
I went to Hong Kong on the Television, and they asked me, 

201
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:33,493
because the person who was owning the television, 
his daughter, invited me

202
00:18:33,493 --> 00:18:38,102
And she said, "Mother, can we ask people to put their hands towards you, like this?" 

203
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:41,031
I said, "All right. Let’s start." 
And they got Realization, 

204
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:44,273
so many of them! They wrote letters that, 
"We got Realization." 

205
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:48,325
On the television! 

206
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:54,332
Even on the telephone, you can give Realization, 
on the telephone you can save people. 

207
00:18:54,332 --> 00:19:00,000
All this science has created, it's for Sahaja Yogis and for Sahaja Yoga. 

208
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,541
It is a blessing to communicate the message. 

209
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:08,251
But, people are so blind, so blind,

210
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:17,052
that they think all this has been given to us to make more money and to create more plastics. 

211
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:27,018
They cannot believe that this is to communicate about God’s love, his compassion

212
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:35,826
 and that security that is from the most loving Father you could think of.

213
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:42,127
It is beyond human conception to understand his compassion, I accept.  

214
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:47,890
But still you see compassion in life and if He is the source of compassion 

215
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:51,552
then what must be his level of compassion? 

216
00:19:51,552 --> 00:19:57,658
Now as it is, he [Warren] has told you all about this quite a lot and I have also yesterday told you

217
00:19:57,658 --> 00:20:02,493
And he said that I have only one more lecture to cover the whole subject, I don’t know what’s going to happen, 

218
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:07,795
how far I can go with people in New York. 

219
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:13,363
I think we may have one more lecture when I come back, one more lecture might be. 

220
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:17,611
But today, I think I should talk to you about the Self, first of all,

221
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:21,126
then about all these things, it will be a better idea. 

222
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:27,085
Now what is the Self within you? 

223
00:20:29,158 --> 00:20:37,534
Self is the reflection of God Almighty. 

224
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:47,552
First, let us see how the creation came into being. 

225
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,702
In the beginning or in the end

226
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:56,443
because there is no beginning and there is no end.

227
00:20:56,443 --> 00:21:01,363
Like you cannot say, "Hen came first, it came first or the egg", it’s something like that.

228
00:21:01,363 --> 00:21:07,330
It started at a point, you see, when it was just all quiet. 

229
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:16,661
And the whole creation becomes 

230
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:21,638
untroubled or we can say it is sleeping.

231
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:23,658
Everything is sleeping,

232
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:28,134
like we sleep so the whole world sleeps for us.

233
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:32,423
That is a state that’s called as Parabrahma in Sanskrit language. 

234
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:35,449
That is a state that’s called as Parabrahma in Sanskrit language. 

235
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:41,310
Now, in the Bible, whatever is written is very telescopic and very fast. 

236
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,673
And to understand it I am just trying to enlarge it 

237
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:50,000
that where ever are the missing points, you can put them up. 

238
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,406
Now the first state is of Parabrahma 

239
00:21:54,406 --> 00:22:03,411
is a state where everything is not manifesting, 

240
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:07,415
everything is sleeping. 

241
00:22:07,904 --> 00:22:15,077
Then this Parabrahma becomes aware of Itself 

242
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:20,000
that It awakens as we awaken. 

243
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,719
Then It starts manifesting. 

244
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:29,507
All the awareness, the consciousness of that

245
00:22:29,507 --> 00:22:34,621
starts accumulating on the periphery  

246
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:44,415
and the centre remains as the Subject. 

247
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:52,573
The periphery now is the Power of that Subject. 

248
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:58,921
So we had the subject, the God Almighty, is called as Sadashiva 

249
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:03,356
and his Power that is the Primordial Power,

250
00:23:03,356 --> 00:23:10,000
in Sanskrit is called as Adi Shakti, 
and we call it as Holy Ghost in the Bible. 

251
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,336
So, they separate, I mean it’s a –

252
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:20,506
some drawings have to be made but doesn’t matter now- I'll just tell you in short.

253
00:23:20,506 --> 00:23:26,628
And this Spectator, this Sadashiva,

254
00:23:26,628 --> 00:23:32,280
this God Almighty starts watching his own Power.

255
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:39,329
Now we cannot understand the complete concord and complete understanding, 

256
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:45,379
complete oneness and integration between these two entities, 

257
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:52,142
God Almighty and his Power. It’s like the Sun and his rays or sunshine, 

258
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:56,577
Moon and moonlight, but even more than that. 

259
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:58,722
Nothing can come in between them. 

260
00:23:58,722 --> 00:24:04,284
They are absolutely in unison with each other 

261
00:24:04,284 --> 00:24:08,585
and every thing works simultaneously. 

262
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:15,779
In human relationship, no husband and wife can be like that, it’s impossible. 

263
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:31,418
Then the Spectator, Sadashiva, forces his Power, which forms an entity, to create. 

264
00:24:31,956 --> 00:24:34,631
First, She refuses. 

265
00:24:34,631 --> 00:24:41,344
And then He gives Her- I mean in a very poetic way- it’s called as a “Lasya”, means a launch.

266
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:45,335
And that gives the first sound, Omkara. 

267
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:50,000
That’s the first, logos, the first sound, the Word. 

268
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,908
That’s the Word She says, She creates. 

269
00:24:56,397 --> 00:25:00,000
Then She starts creating. 

270
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,348
She creates, She divides Herself 

271
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:06,967
First of all, She is nothing but the Power of desire.

272
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:14,575
Because, first it is to be desired! It’s the God’s desire! 

273
00:25:14,575 --> 00:25:17,048
She exists as a desire.

274
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,831
Unless and until there is desire, nothing can work out. 

275
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:27,192
So She is the Power of desire. like we have also the Power of desire within us. 

276
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:36,911
Then from this desire, comes the other Power which makes it an act.

277
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:42,679
So the other Power of action comes in. 

278
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:53,302
These two Powers bring forth a system in between themselves, 

279
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,853
like left and right, 

280
00:25:56,853 --> 00:26:01,465
which starts giving sustenance to things that have been created. 

281
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:08,043
As I told you that carbon has four valences, it’s a tetravalent, 

282
00:26:08,043 --> 00:26:13,929
I don’t know if you people have studied chemistry or not, there’s a chemical periodic table if you see,

283
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:19,047
it’s all divided so beautifully and it is so well arranged, 

284
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:24,671
that one has to believe that there is a great Juggler 

285
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:29,583
or a great Planner who has done it, otherwise it’s not possible. 

286
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:35,326
It’s so well arranged! The whole valences system and everything is so well arranged. 

287
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:47,228
All this is done by the central path which gives them the sustenance, the quality that they have. 

288
00:26:47,228 --> 00:26:50,459
Then the sustenance starts growing

289
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:54,934
till you become a human being as shown here.

290
00:26:54,934 --> 00:27:01,261
In this Void, here as carbon then you move into the Void 

291
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:07,455
and here you go through all the evolution starting from a fish 

292
00:27:07,455 --> 00:27:12,624
up to the human level where you become a small man.

293
00:27:13,015 --> 00:27:19,094
Once you become the small man, Vamana, is called that. 

294
00:27:19,094 --> 00:27:24,455
First the man who came on this earth was a small statured man. 

295
00:27:24,846 --> 00:27:34,542
Then a man came who was Parashurama, a very, very - Poseidon, a very large man, huge man.

296
00:27:35,128 --> 00:27:38,092
Two extremes. 

297
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:44,490
And then, came the man who was in the centre. 

298
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:52,568
And the leadership of all this evolution was done by the Incarnation 

299
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:57,419
of the aspect which is the evolutionary aspect.

300
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:02,832
So the first aspect She creates is of desire aspect. 

301
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:07,534
When the desire dies, the whole thing is destroyed. 

302
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:10,196
And the Spectator is watching it. 

303
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:12,417
Spectator has a desire. 

304
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:16,540
As long as the Spectator is happy, the play goes on. 

305
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,256
As soon as He doesn’t like the spectacle, He disappears.   

306
00:28:21,256 --> 00:28:32,455
As soon as He disappears, then the whole show is over. 

307
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:37,691
It’s for that only Spectator the whole show is there. 

308
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:43,067
So this Power of desire has to be till the end. 

309
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:47,305
Once the Power of desire is finished, then there is no more show; 

310
00:28:47,305 --> 00:28:50,001
there’s no more Spectator, 

311
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:52,953
there’s no more his Power, they’re all merge together 

312
00:28:52,953 --> 00:28:56,394
and again become the Parabrahma status.

313
00:28:58,546 --> 00:29:01,189
Now the other Power, as I said,

314
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:05,097
which is the aspect of creation so the Creator aspect is there.

315
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:11,698
One is the one which is the existence and the other side of the existence is the Destroyer. 

316
00:29:11,698 --> 00:29:15,211
And then another aspect is of the Creator 

317
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:21,669
and the central one is the Sustainer, is the Protector.

318
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:29,483
Out of these, this one incarnates, only one aspect 

319
00:29:29,483 --> 00:29:34,280
because it has to give a quality and the leadership. 

320
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,411
For example, when there was a great flood, 

321
00:29:38,411 --> 00:29:41,332
then He [Vishnu] incarnated. 

322
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:44,472
He incarnated as a fish 

323
00:29:44,472 --> 00:29:48,232
and the dolphin-fish. Dolphin. 

324
00:29:48,232 --> 00:29:51,892
I don’t know if you know about dolphins or not. 

325
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:56,176
But dolphin is a mammal and is a friend of human beings. 

326
00:29:56,176 --> 00:30:02,004
So He incarnated as a dolphin-fish and saved the boat [Noa’s Ark]. 

327
00:30:02,004 --> 00:30:06,994
As you know, there was a boat in which people were saved.

328
00:30:06,994 --> 00:30:12,566
He saved the boat. He is the dolphin who incarnated on this Earth. 

329
00:30:12,908 --> 00:30:16,866
One by one, He incarnates. 

330
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:22,665
Then He incarnates as a turtle, 

331
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:27,518
four legged, which comes out of the water 

332
00:30:27,518 --> 00:30:32,310
to show the fishes that you can come out. 

333
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:39,584
Then, gradually He incarnates as a quadruped. 

334
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:43,979
Like that, the Incarnations — He comes as a leader.

335
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:48,814
Somebody has to give that confidence. 

336
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:53,551
One fish comes and takes them out 

337
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:57,564
and others come, they follow them up. 

338
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:04,085
As they go on improving, every time there is an Incarnation.

339
00:31:04,085 --> 00:31:08,352
And between one Incarnation and another Incarnation,

340
00:31:08,352 --> 00:31:13,523
there is a very great time

341
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:18,714
and that is called as 'Yugas [eras]. 

342
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,562
Like that, these Incarnations come on this Earth.

343
00:31:24,855 --> 00:31:31,164
Plus the incarnations of the Primordial Being come in this area [Void] 

344
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:35,409
- where we can say this is the Ocean of Illusions -

345
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:39,101
and try to save the people

346
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:46,472
 from getting too much to that side [right] or to this side [left] as I told you yesterday. 

347
00:31:47,694 --> 00:31:53,848
And that time, when they become human beings,  

348
00:31:53,848 --> 00:31:58,839
then the seekers are born, which you are, 

349
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:06,353
which are the epitome, epitome of human evolution. 

350
00:32:06,646 --> 00:32:15,945
Now these seekers are engulfed by forces of ignorance 

351
00:32:15,945 --> 00:32:20,625
and these ignorance forces also form anti-Christ.

352
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:28,881
They can be devilish because they think, “Why are we not there?” like a competition setting. 

353
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:35,038
And they try to retard the progress of the saints. 

354
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:40,710
That’s why a seeker, when he’s born, is attacked, 

355
00:32:41,101 --> 00:32:47,404
from very childhood, immediately he is attacked.  

356
00:32:47,404 --> 00:32:50,681
Even the parents may attack the seeker. 

357
00:32:50,681 --> 00:32:52,871
They may act through the parents. 

358
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:57,521
If not the parents, then the society, the schools. 

359
00:32:57,521 --> 00:33:00,000
They’re all the time attacked.

360
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:08,468
The people who are attacking may not be aware of it but they are used as mediums and these people are attacked.

361
00:33:09,543 --> 00:33:15,879
And with that attack, when they are absolutely in a mess,

362
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:20,538
and they don’t know how to save themselves,

363
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:26,717
then, another Incarnation is specially made,

364
00:33:27,597 --> 00:33:32,771
is the One that manifest here 

365
00:33:32,771 --> 00:33:42,362
who is the desire Power of God, but is the Destroyer part, 

366
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:52,724
who is born to destroy these evil forces, to kill them. 

367
00:33:54,434 --> 00:34:06,306
This is 14 thousand years back, the first incarnation of this great Lady. 

368
00:34:07,674 --> 00:34:14,171
She’s called as Jagadamba, the Mother of this world.  

369
00:34:14,171 --> 00:34:20,000
She comes in there [centre heart]. She saves them. 

370
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:29,518
Today is the first day, we celebrated the first day of an Incarnation 

371
00:34:29,518 --> 00:34:40,324
and that is a very, very important day for Indians, because they believe in Shakti and She is the Shakti, 

372
00:34:40,324 --> 00:34:49,018
that she came on this earth to kill these horrible devilish incarnations 

373
00:34:49,018 --> 00:34:53,961
who are called as rakshasas. 

374
00:34:54,596 --> 00:35:00,651
So this part is represented within us 

375
00:35:00,651 --> 00:35:10,823
at the heart level in the centre, in the vertical column

376
00:35:10,823 --> 00:35:17,656
and it manifests in the children till the age of 12 in the sternum 

377
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:24,177
and creates antibodies. She creates Her army as the antibodies. 

378
00:35:24,177 --> 00:35:28,897
Till the age of 12 years the children develop those antibodies within themselves 

379
00:35:28,897 --> 00:35:39,698
and whenever there is a danger, whether it is physical, emotional or spiritual danger, 

380
00:35:39,698 --> 00:35:44,102
these antibodies fight. 

381
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:49,282
That’s why, when you are frightened, the sternum starts breathing fast 

382
00:35:49,282 --> 00:36:01,488
and informs that all the antibodies should join hands to protect the subject. 

383
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:06,618
These antibodies are created here [centre heart]. 

384
00:36:06,618 --> 00:36:20,888
And the left hand side, left had side of this [left heart] is the essence of Motherhood.

385
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:28,464
If in your childhood, your Mother had played a role 

386
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:38,043
which has given you fears or kind of a frightening experience, then this center goes out.

387
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:41,759
We say the left heart is catching. 

388
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:46,953
Sometimes, if you are a bad mother also it might catch.

389
00:36:47,295 --> 00:36:53,316
The right heart is the one, is that of the father. 

390
00:36:53,316 --> 00:37:00,979
And the fatherhood is expressed by the leader who came on this earth about 8 thousand years back,

391
00:37:00,979 --> 00:37:03,423
who is called as Shri Rama.

392
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:07,335
He is not - if  you see here, He’s in the center. 

393
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:13,590
To make him a complete human being, He was pushed onto the right-hand side. 

394
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:16,327
He is Shri Rama.

395
00:37:16,327 --> 00:37:24,218
Shri Rama came on this earth to establish the institution of benevolent king. 

396
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,353
The political development and the political evolution started from his side.

397
00:37:31,353 --> 00:37:35,997
He is the one who gave leadership as a benevolent king, 

398
00:37:35,997 --> 00:37:47,090
the one who represents God and who is a king. The idea of a king related to God came from Shri Rama.

399
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:52,770
But the modern Kings are not like that, they have no relation with God. 

400
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:59,368
On the contrary, they are horrid people. Some of them are nothing but satanic people. 

401
00:37:59,368 --> 00:38:02,057
Absolutely Satan they are!

402
00:38:02,057 --> 00:38:07,089
And you can see from the way they lead their lives and they have led their life before

403
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:13,202
So the benevolence of Shri Rama is here to be followed 

404
00:38:13,202 --> 00:38:20,752
by all the political leaders and all the people who are at the helm of affairs. 

405
00:38:20,752 --> 00:38:25,226
He is the ideal that was created for human beings, 

406
00:38:25,226 --> 00:38:32,737
to run their authority as the head, 

407
00:38:32,737 --> 00:38:40,000
or the loving compassionate benevolent leader of the people, 

408
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,079
who has to govern them by making them respectful, 

409
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,353
by respect. 

410
00:38:48,353 --> 00:38:58,031
And if human beings create such kings who are not respectable,

411
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:03,513
 those who have no human values, those who have no moral courage,  

412
00:39:03,513 --> 00:39:07,859
those who are selfish, those who are self-centred,

413
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:12,124
then they have nothing to do to be there.

414
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:17,266
So this is the position of Rama who is the father. 

415
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:23,660
So the head of every state has to be the father of his subjects, 

416
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:31,675
that’s what He has tried to show by his life. So much so that He had to sacrifice his beloved Wife, 

417
00:39:31,675 --> 00:39:35,097
whom He loved so much. 

418
00:39:35,537 --> 00:39:40,879
But these days, you know, how people do for their own children, they’ll sell the whole country. 

419
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,808
In our India, they do it. 

420
00:39:43,808 --> 00:39:50,606
Here it’s just the other way round, nobody cares for children at all and nobody knows whose children they are. 

421
00:39:50,606 --> 00:39:58,601
But in India it’s the other way round, that they will even sell their country for their children. 

422
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:04,190
All these two extremes go against the character of Shri Rama.

423
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,478
Now this is the character that was created 8 thousand years back. 

424
00:40:10,478 --> 00:40:17,232
So I’ve explaining to you all these things. 
Now this is the heart. In the heart resides the Spirit.

425
00:40:17,232 --> 00:40:24,136
The Spirit is watching the game of this creation, 

426
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:33,739
and is watching what is happening to this person, this person, to this person, to this person.

427
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:40,374
Every body has got in their heart the Spirit 

428
00:40:40,374 --> 00:40:44,262
which is watching. 
It’s called as the “cetana” [consciousness],  

429
00:40:44,262 --> 00:40:47,512
means the one, the knower of the field. 

430
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:55,157
So, he’s watching every minute; he knows what you do, when you go, what mistakes you create, he watching,

431
00:40:55,157 --> 00:40:58,102
he doesn’t interfere.  

432
00:40:58,102 --> 00:41:02,647
He’s only- the interference comes from here [Swaddisthan?], from that thing, 

433
00:41:02,647 --> 00:41:06,902
He tries to give you conscience, he tries to improve you.

434
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:12,023
From here sometimes [Mooladhara], the wisdom part, he tries to tell you, “Be in the center”

435
00:41:12,023 --> 00:41:15,990
by punishing you and showing it is wrong. 

436
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:22,386
But he’s just watching the game, “Let’s see how far it goes.” 

437
00:41:22,386 --> 00:41:26,448
He is 'the knower of your field'. 

438
00:41:26,448 --> 00:41:30,574
He is the Universal Being within you. 

439
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:37,514
He is the reflection of that God Almighty who’s the Spectator within you. 

440
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:46,435
And his Power is this All-pervading Power which has created all this [the subtle system]. 

441
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:53,975
So to feel this All-pervading Power, you have to become the Spirit. 

442
00:41:53,975 --> 00:41:57,922
All this creation has no meaning if you do not become the Spirit. 

443
00:41:57,922 --> 00:42:02,872
In the Vedas, the first, the very first stanza says that, 

444
00:42:02,872 --> 00:42:06,476
"By reading Vedas, if you do not become Vedis [ wise men] 

445
00:42:06,476 --> 00:42:10,755
-Vedinies- 'Veda' word comes from 'vidya'. Vidya means to know; 

446
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:15,775
if you don’t become the knowledge, then it has no meaning. 

447
00:42:15,775 --> 00:42:25,121
But knowledge doesn’t lie in dancing and shouting and all the monkey tricks that people do; 

448
00:42:25,415 --> 00:42:27,614
it’s no monkey tricks there. 

449
00:42:27,956 --> 00:42:36,097
Knowledge is that you become the Self, you feel the All-pervading Power and by which you know everything else. 

450
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:42,599
That is Self-knowledge and that is what we have to achieve. 

451
00:42:43,381 --> 00:42:50,579
If you do not want to become your Spirit, 
I’m sorry, I’ve nothing to offer. 

452
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:56,920
If you have some other things in your mind, you can go away from here, but no use arguing it,

453
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:03,713
 there should be no argument about it. 
If you don’t want to become, I have nothing to say, 

454
00:43:03,713 --> 00:43:07,331
I’ve nothing else to offer or to request you. 

455
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:15,616
I would request you that you become your Spirit, then we’ll talk about it. 

456
00:43:15,616 --> 00:43:20,503
And when you become your Spirit - there’s a very good book 

457
00:43:20,503 --> 00:43:23,901
written by Adi Shankaracharya in the 6 century,

458
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:28,080
the one who was the first Shankaracharya, nowadays all of them are horrible ones.

459
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:34,235
One of them is now making a big umbrella of gold, set with diamonds, imagine! 

460
00:43:34,235 --> 00:43:40,000
He’s a short fellow. I said, 
"This umbrella will fall upon him one day". 

461
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,744
He’s trying to compete with Pope. 

462
00:43:44,744 --> 00:43:49,143
And this Adi Shankaracharya has said that, 

463
00:43:49,143 --> 00:43:56,986
"Nothing can work it out, no Yoge, no shankye, no. All these philosophies are useless.

464
00:43:56,986 --> 00:44:02,856
It only works out- no discipline, nothing- 

465
00:44:02,856 --> 00:44:05,673
by the Grace of the Mother;

466
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:12,511
by the Grace of the Mother who is the Kundalini herself, She’s the Primordial Kundalini. 

467
00:44:12,511 --> 00:44:18,561
Only by the awakening of the Kundalini it works out. It’s clearly given but you people do not read those books.

468
00:44:18,903 --> 00:44:24,327
Today is the name of the Goddess. Ten of them are nothing but the different chakras,

469
00:44:24,327 --> 00:44:28,181
where She resides in the Mooladhara. She resides in the Swadhishthana. 

470
00:44:28,181 --> 00:44:35,072
She resides in the Manipura, She resides in the - what you call - this Hridaya (heart) chakra. 

471
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:40,008
Then She resides in the Vishuddhi, then into Agnya, and then into Sahasrara.

472
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,085
 All these names are given there. 

473
00:44:43,085 --> 00:44:48,932
Of course, it was not so clearly said as it is said today because the time was not there to say. 

474
00:44:48,932 --> 00:44:53,944
But all these things are there: how she rises, how she breaks all these “granthis” 

475
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:58,317
which are between these two chakras, are the “granthis” means the knots.

476
00:44:58,317 --> 00:45:01,086
 It’s so clearly given. 

477
00:45:01,086 --> 00:45:04,395
It’s never given that you start jumping like a monkey, 

478
00:45:04,395 --> 00:45:07,041
or you take out your clothes. 

479
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:11,738
All this nonsense is not there, on the contrary, it is said that this is all possession. 

480
00:45:11,738 --> 00:45:17,606
You get “bhootagrasta”, means you get possessed by the dead.

481
00:45:17,899 --> 00:45:20,000
It’s so clearly given!

482
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:28,991
But people don’t read these books: they jump onto people who have come here to show some sort of a mesmerism

483
00:45:28,991 --> 00:45:31,407
and accept it. But you are seekers.

484
00:45:31,407 --> 00:45:36,078
I would request you, you are seekers, first of all know that you are seekers 

485
00:45:36,078 --> 00:45:40,623
and don’t be deluded by these false tricks. 

486
00:45:40,623 --> 00:45:46,585
Do not waste your energy on these false things, you’ll become your Self. 

487
00:45:46,585 --> 00:45:50,270
Of course, it goes without saying that 

488
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:55,743
the change, the transformation, comes in, in your awareness, 

489
00:45:55,743 --> 00:45:59,946
first of all, in your awareness. 

490
00:45:59,946 --> 00:46:06,922
Not in jumping and none of all these nonsensical things. I mean people think that if you become a stupid fellow, 

491
00:46:06,922 --> 00:46:08,437
then your awareness has improved. 

492
00:46:08,437 --> 00:46:13,568
Transformed, after all, after all you are transformed, you see, your were a sane person, you’ve become stupid. 

493
00:46:13,568 --> 00:46:16,448
You are transformed in any case.

494
00:46:16,448 --> 00:46:22,533
If you become mad, then is it a greater transformation. Mother says, “All right, transformation. You have become mad!" 

495
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:28,960
You're sane people, you are landing in a lunatic asylum, you are transformed. And also transmutation has taken place. 

496
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,065
"Because now we wear dresses like lunatic people, 

497
00:46:33,065 --> 00:46:36,028
we behave like lunatic people, transformation has taken place".

498
00:46:36,028 --> 00:46:41,382
It’s an ascent of the mind, you have to ascend.

499
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:47,219
Your awareness has to ascend and not to descend. It’s very easy to descend. 

500
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:54,154
To move on to the left or to the right is not the way, but to move here into Super Consciousness. 

501
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:58,207
And that’s one thing one should know, should happen to you.

502
00:46:58,207 --> 00:47:03,019
That is the Self-knowledge. That is the thing one has to get

503
00:47:03,019 --> 00:47:10,244
is to awaken these centres within you which are represented on your fingers here,

504
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:17,119
seven of these are shown here and then to feel the All-pervading Power to begin with. 

505
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,894
Once it has happened, then to know how to discern,

506
00:47:20,894 --> 00:47:25,827
how to decode, how to find out, how to improve, how to go further with it.

507
00:47:25,827 --> 00:47:28,507
First of all, get the connection!

508
00:47:28,507 --> 00:47:33,192
If your car has not yet started, what are you doing about it?

509
00:47:33,192 --> 00:47:40,730
It’s so simple and such a common sense, but I don’t know how these people have taken over it.

510
00:47:41,121 --> 00:47:48,057
The only problem, as I told you before, is this, that God has given you freedom. 

511
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,719
And that freedom is to be respected.

512
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:57,298
But if you go to these people, you don’t ask any questions, you do as others are doing, just like monkeys. 

513
00:47:57,298 --> 00:48:01,603
You don’t even think why they are doing it. I mean you see that it is so filthy! 

514
00:48:01,603 --> 00:48:06,784
Like a gentleman who came to me, who went to a guru, and he was absolutely ruined.

515
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:09,325
 I said:  "How could you do it? You are an Indian. 

516
00:48:09,325 --> 00:48:13,234
Don’t you know that this is not to be done?" He said, "I just tried to see. 

517
00:48:13,234 --> 00:48:19,381
Just out of curiosity I went there. And then I also started jumping and I got into it". 

518
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:25,286
And for five years he was in it, he could not know that he was in it. 

519
00:48:25,286 --> 00:48:29,663
I said, "For Indians they have some wisdom because they have read all these things, they know all about it. 

520
00:48:29,663 --> 00:48:32,009
How could you do it?"

521
00:48:32,351 --> 00:48:38,215
They know that unholiness is not the way to God. 

522
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:48,403
Now, some of them can give you also an explanation that all your- you are to be cleansed. 

523
00:48:48,989 --> 00:48:53,749
And you pay for it as if you go to some a laundry here, you pay for it,

524
00:48:53,749 --> 00:48:58,643
you put yourself into it, go into some turnings and you become cleansed.

525
00:48:58,643 --> 00:49:01,043
You are to be cleansed. 

526
00:49:01,043 --> 00:49:04,581
You must see their life pattern, you see, you must see how they live. 

527
00:49:04,581 --> 00:49:08,118
The person who cannot even smell a flower how can he cleanse you?"

528
00:49:08,118 --> 00:49:14,038
 He himself needs a lot of treatment. 

529
00:49:14,038 --> 00:49:19,320
Flower he cannot smell, can you imagine a man like that who cannot smell a flower? 

530
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,652
I mean he’s a dumb personality I would say,

531
00:49:22,652 --> 00:49:28,618
the most beautiful thing that is produced is a flower, how is he going to feel the human flowers?

532
00:49:28,618 --> 00:49:31,601
How is he going to enjoy? 

533
00:49:31,992 --> 00:49:38,834
A person who cannot take out his goggles from his eyes and can’t face people,

534
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:43,424
 how can you believe that such a man could be something holy? 

535
00:49:43,424 --> 00:49:48,487
Any holy person doesn’t have this kind of eyes. 

536
00:49:48,487 --> 00:49:56,306
One has to know that if the person doesn’t lead a holy life and parasites, 

537
00:49:56,648 --> 00:50:03,375
greedy  people, asking for money and Roll Royce and things like that, how such people, you think they can be a guru?

538
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,789
You have no self esteem I should say.

539
00:50:06,789 --> 00:50:10,000
They are absolutely devils.

540
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,801
But the problem in this, for me, the problem is very, very different. 

541
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:21,025
Krishna has said, "Yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata…

542
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:27,037
Paritranaya sadhunang vinashay cha dushkritam
…sambhabami yuge" 

543
00:50:27,037 --> 00:50:34,261
He said that, "Whenever there is the degradation of the sustenance, 

544
00:50:34,261 --> 00:50:43,858
then, to save the Saints and to kill the Satanics, 

545
00:50:43,858 --> 00:50:50,553
I come on this earth and take a form." 

546
00:50:50,846 --> 00:50:58,153
Now the problem is, all the Saints have got these Satanics in their heads. My problem is very complicated. 

547
00:50:58,153 --> 00:51:03,872
I know they are Saints, I know there are the ones who are seekers and have been for ages, 

548
00:51:03,872 --> 00:51:09,761
but they are impressed by the Satanics and the Satanics are ruling.

549
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:17,948
So if any- if the question of killing, 'samarak', of Krishna  comes in, you see, even if they are killed

550
00:51:17,948 --> 00:51:21,514
they are in your brains, then how can you kill?

551
00:51:21,514 --> 00:51:28,792
They have to go out of your brain. The complicated structure today of the seekers is this, 

552
00:51:28,792 --> 00:51:34,947
that in their brains they have got all the Satanics centred, they cannot get rid of it. 

553
00:51:34,947 --> 00:51:36,984
They are so impressed! 

554
00:51:36,984 --> 00:51:44,136
Yesterday, the fellow said, "But Mother, everything is good, there is nothing like evil." I said, "Really?" 

555
00:51:44,136 --> 00:51:56,959
You can imagine To believe in such a thing 

556
00:51:56,959 --> 00:51:59,601
Then why do you need discrimination? Go ahead. 

557
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:04,331
Whether you go to hell or to heaven what does it matter? If there is no evil, 

558
00:52:04,331 --> 00:52:10,665
enjoy your Hell! Have a holiday!

559
00:52:11,398 --> 00:52:16,892
Christ has so many times said about the Satan. 

560
00:52:16,892 --> 00:52:21,754
Not only but He said that the Satan tried to tempt Him. 

561
00:52:21,754 --> 00:52:28,987
He has talked of Satan and still, how do you believe that there is no evil? I just can’t understand. 

562
00:52:34,421 --> 00:52:39,855
There is not only evil but the darkness is so great 

563
00:52:39,855 --> 00:52:46,293
that we are standing at a point so precariously placed,  very precarious placed

564
00:52:46,293 --> 00:52:54,454
 that people are more impressed by evil than by good. See how many people we are. Just see for yourself.

565
00:52:54,943 --> 00:53:01,445
Here we are for reality, you cannot pay for anything, you get your Realization, 

566
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:04,298
50% people have got Realization here, 

567
00:53:04,298 --> 00:53:07,701
but how many people there are? And they have no patience even to sit down

568
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:12,922
but I’ve known people: "I’ve been with a guru for 8 years. He is in my heart".

569
00:53:12,922 --> 00:53:18,471
The heart is all catching and you’re fainting all the time with the guru being there.

570
00:53:18,715 --> 00:53:22,941
The very big problem which you should realize these are all saints. 

571
00:53:23,186 --> 00:53:28,953
My only concern is to save them. 

572
00:53:29,393 --> 00:53:36,907
There are very subtle methods of sabotising of destroying the work of God. 

573
00:53:36,907 --> 00:53:44,433
And you should know, when you get your Realization, that you have to become strong pillars of God’s work 

574
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:55,033
and not indulging into frivolous, useless, cheep things. But get to it, learn it, master it. You’ll become your own master. 

575
00:53:55,033 --> 00:53:59,921
These gurus who have no powers, nothing, they have become gurus and have minted so much money out of you 

576
00:53:59,921 --> 00:54:04,728
and you are the people who are Realized souls and you are so quiet. 

577
00:54:04,728 --> 00:54:11,033
You should shout at the top of houses and say that these are false people, 

578
00:54:11,033 --> 00:54:18,551
these are fake people. Christ himself has said that there will be false and fake gurus. 

579
00:54:18,551 --> 00:54:22,351
And then people said that, "Why are you talking against them?"

580
00:54:22,351 --> 00:54:27,972
 He said, "The Satan is are not going to talk against himself, his house". 

581
00:54:27,972 --> 00:54:31,686
He said it clearly. 

582
00:54:32,175 --> 00:54:38,496
And when people tell me, "Mother, don’t talk against them". I say, I always tell them, "I’ll talk, not only talk, 

583
00:54:38,496 --> 00:54:42,982
but where ever it is possible, I'll tell them definitely, 

584
00:54:42,982 --> 00:54:50,000
I'll verily say that these are Satan whom I know now for ages, for thousands of years, I’ve known them, 

585
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,783
each one of them, all their tricks I know. I know what they do to you. 

586
00:54:54,783 --> 00:55:00,415
And don’t listen to them that they are cleansing you. Let them cleanse themselves and repent

587
00:55:00,415 --> 00:55:05,095
so that they don’t go back into Hell permanently.

588
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:12,610
So here, at this stage of the Mother, She’s terrific. 

589
00:55:12,903 --> 00:55:21,214
She protects you. She has many antibodies. 

590
00:55:21,214 --> 00:55:32,400
Actually, these antibodies were created at a particular time when it was said that there was a Satan who could not be killed

591
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,252
 by the quadruped and the people who have two legs like human beings. 

592
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:50,517
So She created a special type of  a – gnat, you call that gnat? A black thing, with six legs, 

593
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:56,791
and She killed him. And these antibodies are those with the six legs.

594
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:59,541
And they worked it out.

595
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:03,878
There are there and She’s the one who protects us.

596
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:12,549
Now, coming to the gross level, when a lady is worried 

597
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:20,207
about her security, which is very common in America, because husbands, if they have flirts, 

598
00:56:20,207 --> 00:56:26,609
if they have no time for their wives, and if all the time, they tell the wife that, "You may have to leave the house", 

599
00:56:26,609 --> 00:56:32,287
they develop the fear in this area [heart centre]. 

600
00:56:32,287 --> 00:56:43,641
And the disease which is caused by that is breast cancer, which is very common in America, breast cancer. 

601
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:49,017
Breast cancer is caused to women who have a sense of insecurity. 

602
00:56:49,017 --> 00:56:52,563
In Sahaja Yoga, you can cure breast cancer.

603
00:56:52,563 --> 00:56:57,791
It’s very easy to cure breast cancer in Sahaja Yoga.

604
00:56:58,084 --> 00:57:03,567
Now the combination of this and this gives you asthma.  

605
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:09,578
Among men who have asthma, they must look after their fatherhood. 

606
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,935
Their own father- supposing somebody’s father is dead

607
00:57:15,277 --> 00:57:20,570
without the knowledge of the man or the father can possess also.

608
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:24,352
In that case, you get this kind of a thing.

609
00:57:24,352 --> 00:57:30,000
Surprisingly, recently in London, one doctor, I don’t know how, 

610
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,158
he experimented with a lady that was suffering from anorexia. 

611
00:57:36,919 --> 00:57:42,491
Her father had died and she would not eat her food. 

612
00:57:42,491 --> 00:57:47,718
And many of them are like that whose father has died, they suffer from anorexia. 

613
00:57:47,718 --> 00:57:54,783
And he said, "All right, let us see about your father. Let us do some sort of a ceremony for him." 

614
00:57:54,783 --> 00:57:58,868
And she started eating all right, it’s most surprising.

615
00:57:58,868 --> 00:58:01,590
It came in the paper that he did that.

616
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:08,809
That is how you can cure such women who suffer from a deficiency of a fatherhood;

617
00:58:09,053 --> 00:58:16,751
or may be we can say, if the father possessed you, if the child is thinking of the father all the time,

618
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:19,118
all these things can be cured in Sahaja Yoga,

619
00:58:19,118 --> 00:58:24,375
which, I’m sure, when you will go further in the studies of Sahaja Yoga,

620
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:30,569
you will learn one by one, how to cure such people who have these diseases.

621
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:39,439
Now, I think I’ll leave these three centres for tomorrow and I’ll try to cover it up. 

622
00:58:39,439 --> 00:58:44,339
But this is the Spirit that is still watching.

623
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:48,226
When the Kundalini –this is the seat of the Spirit -

624
00:58:48,226 --> 00:58:52,531
when the Kundalini rises and she touches that seat, 

625
00:58:52,531 --> 00:59:00,000
immediately, you get connected to the Spirit.

626
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,742
And the Spirit, which is this All-pervading Power

627
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:11,916
starts flowing through your hands as well as you start feeling it outside. 

628
00:59:12,307 --> 00:59:19,003
The Spectator, the Witness, who was outside our central nervous system, 

629
00:59:19,003 --> 00:59:24,324
now comes into our central nervous system and we know everything about it.

630
00:59:24,324 --> 00:59:29,259
 as we start using this power of Spirit. 

631
00:59:29,259 --> 00:59:33,068
If you remember, Christ was touched by some woman who was sick,

632
00:59:33,068 --> 00:59:37,518
and He felt the power flew to her and this is the same thing.

633
00:59:37,518 --> 00:59:44,285
But Christ was different. He was All-pervading Power. He was Omkara, 

634
00:59:44,285 --> 00:59:48,097
that’s why He could walk on the water. 
 

635
00:59:48,097 --> 00:59:55,672
But about Christ and about Shri Krishna, I’ll tell you later on, tomorrow, if you don’t mind.
