00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,892
1995-1225 Christmas Puja Talk, Ganapatipule, India,

2
00:24:28,096 --> 00:24:34,988
It is a great day when Christ came on this earth.

3
00:24:37,096 --> 00:24:45,988
And you know about how He was specially created

4
00:24:46,096 --> 00:24:57,988
to come down as a human being to work out the salvation of the people.

5
00:25:09,096 --> 00:25:16,988
It is said that He came to India, in Kashmir,

6
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:22,988
and He met there the King Shalivahana.

7
00:25:26,096 --> 00:25:38,988
It’s all in Sanskrit; I’ve read that the conversation took place between Christ and King Shalivahana,

8
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:43,988
who was a great devotee of the Mother.

9
00:25:45,096 --> 00:25:49,988
And he asked Him, “What is Your name?” In Sanskrit it’s all written.

10
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:57,988
So He said, “I come from a country where people believe in filth,

11
00:25:58,096 --> 00:26:01,988
and I think this is My own country.”

12
00:26:02,096 --> 00:26:07,988
So Shalivahana said, “You are such a great person, who has come on this earth,

13
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:16,988
so You should go back to those countries to save them

14
00:26:17,096 --> 00:26:26,988
and to tell them about the pure principle of life.”

15
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:30,988
In Sanskrit it was written Nirmala Tattwa.

16
00:26:34,096 --> 00:26:44,988
And Christ went back, and after three and a half years only He was crucified.

17
00:26:54,096 --> 00:27:00,988
These were special days, I call them the days of tapasya.

18
00:27:03,096 --> 00:27:06,988
Same time Buddha and Mahavira were born,

19
00:27:07,096 --> 00:27:15,988
at the same level of the Virata’s forehead.

20
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:35,988
As you know that according to Vedas, there are seven awarenesses we can go through,

21
00:27:36,096 --> 00:27:42,988
or the subtle qualities we have within ourselves.

22
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:51,988
The first one was the Bhu. Bhu is Ganesha was created.

23
00:27:52,096 --> 00:28:01,988
Second is Bhurvah, meaning antariksha, means “all that is created around us.”

24
00:28:06,096 --> 00:28:10,988
The third one is Swaha at Nabhi Chakra.

25
00:28:11,096 --> 00:28:14,988
Swaha is the one where you consume everything.

26
00:28:15,096 --> 00:28:20,988
Is in modern times, you see, people go on consuming everything.

27
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:24,988
All kinds of books they will read; they’ll go to all kinds of things,

28
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:26,988
and if you tell them, “Why do you do it?”

29
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:29,988
“What’s wrong?”

30
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:31,988
“Why do you dress up like this?”

31
00:28:32,096 --> 00:28:33,988
“What’s wrong?”

32
00:28:34,096 --> 00:28:38,988
This just consumption of everything goes on.

33
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:45,988
But then at that time also there is

34
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:50,988
another great thing within us is called as Swadha,

35
00:28:51,096 --> 00:29:01,988
where we sustain the dharma within us. Swadha.

36
00:29:02,096 --> 00:29:04,988
Dharma of everything.

37
00:29:05,096 --> 00:29:10,988
See, those people who say there should be no blind faith and this and that,

38
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:14,988
it’s not blind, but it’s an inner urge.

39
00:29:15,096 --> 00:29:19,988
Why we love our parents? Because there’s a dharma within us.

40
00:29:20,096 --> 00:29:23,988
Why do we live, we live in our country?

41
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,988
Because there’s a dharma within us.

42
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:30,988
All these dharmas are there. Why a wife loves her husband?

43
00:29:31,096 --> 00:29:33,988
Because there is dharma.

44
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:36,988
Why the husband loves the wife? Because there is dharma.

45
00:29:37,096 --> 00:29:41,988
When this dharma is within you - we'll not call it religion

46
00:29:42,096 --> 00:29:48,988
because it can mean something else – this one is sustained, dharaiti.

47
00:29:49,096 --> 00:29:54,988
Once it is sustained within ourselves, it becomes Swadha.

48
00:29:55,096 --> 00:29:57,988
That’s our capacity; that’s our quality.

49
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:03,988
We can call it an innate understanding.

50
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:07,988
Some of them are even in the animals,

51
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:13,988
like attachment to parents, attachment to their masters.

52
00:30:19,096 --> 00:30:27,988
Then comes the higher awareness where your Manah - now it's not mind.

53
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,988
There’s very confusion; there’s a big confusion. Mind,

54
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:34,988
you see, English language is really quite confusing.

55
00:30:35,096 --> 00:30:39,988
Manah means “by which we have emotions.”

56
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:46,988
Now recently I read that they are now talking about, not only of IQ

57
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:50,988
but EQ, means emotional coefficience.

58
00:30:52,096 --> 00:30:57,988
That means a person who has only intelligence is not all right,

59
00:30:58,096 --> 00:31:02,988
he must also have the balance of emotions. They are coming to it now.

60
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:06,988
But first they only used to praise people who have IQ.

61
00:31:07,096 --> 00:31:12,988
That’s not the situation. So now it is different,

62
00:31:13,096 --> 00:31:21,988
perhaps they are realizing that through intelligence how people have created chaos, violence,

63
00:31:22,096 --> 00:31:28,988
all kinds of destruction on this earth.

64
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:33,988
So now they are talking about a higher capacity within us

65
00:31:34,096 --> 00:31:38,988
called as EQ, which capacity is emotional.

66
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:49,988
This emotional capacity comes to you as an inner urge,

67
00:31:50,096 --> 00:31:57,988
as an inner capability which you cannot avoid.

68
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:05,988
A person may be anything in life, but if he has no love,

69
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:15,988
if he hasn’t got any emotional feelings, then he is not complete.

70
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:22,988
Now these emotional things also could be very limited, no doubt.

71
00:32:23,096 --> 00:32:28,988
There could be something that get attached to somebody, or something can happen,

72
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:34,988
as also the IQ, where we get attached to some idea.

73
00:32:35,096 --> 00:32:41,988
Like Hitler had some idea, and he believed that it was the truth, and he has to do it.

74
00:32:42,096 --> 00:32:46,988
So when you get attached to one idea like that,

75
00:32:47,096 --> 00:32:58,988
you can just do things which are not at all helpful, supportive or nourishing to reality.

76
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:08,988
All these things have happened: wars, destruction, also,

77
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:15,988
as you see nowadays, the people are trying to secretly destroy others.

78
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:23,988
All these are coming as the anti-feeling

79
00:33:24,096 --> 00:33:33,988
where the Manah has developed a domination of the intelligence,

80
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:41,988
where emotions are dominated by intelligence and rationality.

81
00:33:47,096 --> 00:33:51,988
So there is another awareness within us, another capability within us,

82
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:56,988
another urge within us, innately built is the Janah.

83
00:33:57,096 --> 00:34:00,988
Janah means the people, the communication.

84
00:34:03,096 --> 00:34:10,988
You cannot live alone; you see a man who goes to jail, he’s quite happy,

85
00:34:11,096 --> 00:34:16,988
he’s quite comfortable, he doesn’t have to do any work, everything is done for him

86
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:23,988
if he has a good class, he lives very well, much better than he would live outside.

87
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:33,988
But the only thing is, he cannot meet other people, he cannot communicate.

88
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:39,988
And when this capacity of communication which is within us - I mean,

89
00:34:40,096 --> 00:34:47,988
which is a part and parcel of human existence - is taken away,

90
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:54,988
a person in the jail feels absolutely frustrated and unhappy.

91
00:35:00,096 --> 00:35:07,988
He doesn’t mind laboring, doing all kinds of menial work,

92
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:17,988
as long as he’s not in the jail, cut out of the communications with others.

93
00:35:20,096 --> 00:35:25,988
So this communication is also an inner urge within us.

94
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:32,988
In that also people sometimes go too far and neglect other dharmas.

95
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:34,988
They are more bothered about communication

96
00:35:35,096 --> 00:35:37,988
than about other dharmas which are very important.

97
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:42,988
So there is no balance in a person.

98
00:35:46,096 --> 00:35:56,988
Then comes the sixth awareness within us, which is a very interesting thing.

99
00:35:57,096 --> 00:36:02,988
One was where we take to conditionings.

100
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:10,988
Say, if I am an Indian, then I am very proud of Indians;

101
00:36:11,096 --> 00:36:16,988
I can never see anything wrong with them, or I may see everything wrong with them,

102
00:36:17,096 --> 00:36:19,988
it can be both ways.

103
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,988
How you have been conditioned is the point,

104
00:36:23,096 --> 00:36:30,988
and this conditioning comes to us through our sixth center of Agnya.

105
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:35,988
And the another thing that we develop

106
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:42,988
when somebody tries to condition us or to control us,

107
00:36:43,096 --> 00:36:50,988
we try to get out of it, or sometimes we try to dominate.

108
00:36:51,096 --> 00:36:57,988
This dominating capacity is also within us innately built.

109
00:37:00,096 --> 00:37:07,988
Both things are innately built within us that we go on getting ourselves conditioned.

110
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:17,988
For example I would say that in very stupid, silly manner, people get conditioned,

111
00:37:18,096 --> 00:37:22,988
is impossible to get them out of it.

112
00:37:23,096 --> 00:37:33,988
It always comes out of self-centeredness that a person has no value for understanding.

113
00:37:36,096 --> 00:37:41,988
Like now somebody comes to your house, he’s a vegetarian,

114
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:44,988
all right. Now he stays with you.

115
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:50,988
So, "I’m a vegetarian, you must get new utensils to cook the food

116
00:37:51,096 --> 00:37:56,988
because I can’t have food in the utensils where the meat is cooked.”

117
00:37:57,096 --> 00:38:04,988
All right. Then, “You must get your servant in a proper manner,

118
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:14,988
so send him to some place where you can get the well water.”

119
00:38:15,096 --> 00:38:21,988
The servant must be absolutely drenched - this is typical Indian old style -

120
00:38:22,096 --> 00:38:30,988
and should go and draw the water from the well, and “bring me it for drinking and cooking,”

121
00:38:31,096 --> 00:38:34,988
while the servant dies of pneumonia, doesn’t matter.

122
00:38:35,096 --> 00:38:39,988
All such stupid conditionings we have,

123
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:45,988
but it's not only that in the East you find all these conditionings - the West is even worse.

124
00:38:46,096 --> 00:38:50,988
For example, they have clubbing.

125
00:38:51,096 --> 00:39:00,988
Now, there are clubs where people wear particular type of clothes;

126
00:39:01,096 --> 00:39:07,988
it’s a club. Now, if they wear something else then everybody will laugh at them.

127
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:15,988
Or how to use the spoon and fork is very important in the West, how they use spoon and fork.

128
00:39:16,096 --> 00:39:19,988
Specially English have this nonsensical conditioning.

129
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:24,988
If somebody uses the fork and spoon in a wrong way then, finished!

130
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:29,988
He is nowhere; he is not sophisticated.

131
00:39:30,096 --> 00:39:38,988
The ideas of sophistication and all that comes through conditioning of ages,

132
00:39:39,096 --> 00:39:44,988
because maybe they were primitive to begin with, they had no clothes,

133
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:47,988
proper clothes to wear,

134
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:54,988
might be they were covering themselves with some leaves or something,

135
00:39:55,096 --> 00:40:00,988
I mean, only hundreds of years back.

136
00:40:01,096 --> 00:40:06,988
So now they have jumped to the other side, very particular about their dress,

137
00:40:07,096 --> 00:40:12,988
very particular about fork and spoon.

138
00:40:13,096 --> 00:40:19,988
And they just can’t bear something that is different.

139
00:40:20,096 --> 00:40:24,988
“I don’t like that,” is very common there, “I don’t like. I don’t like.”

140
00:40:26,096 --> 00:40:28,988
Now, they came to India, “We don’t like.”

141
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:31,988
“What you don’t like?”

142
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,988
“We don’t like the way Indians dress up.”

143
00:40:34,096 --> 00:40:36,988
“All right, you dress up the way you like,

144
00:40:37,096 --> 00:40:39,988
let Indians dress up the like they like.

145
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:45,988
Now why do you think that your dress in England will suit here in India,

146
00:40:46,096 --> 00:40:50,988
which is such a hot, hot, hot country?”

147
00:40:51,096 --> 00:40:55,988
But no, “This is how we are.” It’s quite funny the way they have,

148
00:40:56,096 --> 00:41:07,988
and this conditioning goes on into such a deep manner that nobody sees the stupidity behind it.

149
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:13,988
For example, if the Queen has invited you, you must wear a tailcoat,

150
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:17,988
and now it's very expensive to have a tailcoat.

151
00:41:18,096 --> 00:41:21,988
Now, they have to go to a particular shop to borrow it.

152
00:41:22,096 --> 00:41:25,988
Sometimes they're loose, and sometimes they're tight.

153
00:41:26,096 --> 00:41:30,988
I have seen people coming to these parties, Queen’s parties,

154
00:41:31,096 --> 00:41:35,988
I could never recognize them because somebody looked like Charlie Chaplin,

155
00:41:36,096 --> 00:41:40,988
or somebody looked like Laurel, or somebody like Hardy.

156
00:41:41,096 --> 00:41:43,988
I couldn’t make out who are these people.

157
00:41:44,096 --> 00:41:46,988
Then I was told, “He's that such and such ambassador.”

158
00:41:47,096 --> 00:41:49,988
“Oh my God, I know him very well, what has happened to him?”

159
00:41:50,096 --> 00:41:51,988
They cannot walk straight,

160
00:41:52,096 --> 00:41:59,988
their gait changes because of the clothes which are so tight sometimes, and sometimes so loose.

161
00:42:00,096 --> 00:42:01,988
But you have to wear.

162
00:42:02,096 --> 00:42:08,988
All these formal ideas come to us as a kind of a part and parcel of you,

163
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:12,988
because you accept all these conditionings.

164
00:42:13,096 --> 00:42:18,988
So the other side it goes to, that we abandon all this,

165
00:42:19,096 --> 00:42:21,988
we don’t want all, we're anti-culture.

166
00:42:23,096 --> 00:42:26,988
So I met one gentleman who was wearing a pant which had lots of holes in it.

167
00:42:27,096 --> 00:42:31,988
Imagine in the cold of London to wear a pant like that.

168
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:37,988
So I said, “Why do you want to wear a pant which has holes?”

169
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:39,988
He said, “This is a holy pant."

170
00:42:40,096 --> 00:42:42,988
“Holey?

171
00:42:43,096 --> 00:42:47,988
My goodness, it will give you varicose veins, it's horrible.”

172
00:42:48,096 --> 00:42:49,988
“What’s wrong?

173
00:42:50,096 --> 00:42:55,988
We are anti-culture people so we are taking now to holey pants.”

174
00:42:56,096 --> 00:42:59,988
I mean, such stupid people are not only who are uneducated,

175
00:43:00,096 --> 00:43:06,988
but very well educated people, highly-placed people, are so conditioned,

176
00:43:07,096 --> 00:43:12,988
and this conditioning has caused so much damage to human beings.

177
00:43:13,096 --> 00:43:19,988
For example, to accept Freud had become just a complete religion in the West.

178
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:26,988
Freud became Christ at that level, though he was a Jew.

179
00:43:27,096 --> 00:43:31,988
And he dominated the Western culture so much

180
00:43:32,096 --> 00:43:36,988
that I just couldn’t understand the impact of this stupid man

181
00:43:37,096 --> 00:43:40,988
who would have been thrown in the sea if he had come to India.

182
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:45,988
But the conditioning part is: "Everything is written is law,"

183
00:43:46,096 --> 00:43:49,988
and they accepted this man so much

184
00:43:50,096 --> 00:43:56,988
that the culture of the West became absolutely self-destructive throughout.

185
00:43:57,096 --> 00:44:02,988
No respect, no morality, nothing was lofty,

186
00:44:03,096 --> 00:44:07,988
all value systems shattered

187
00:44:08,096 --> 00:44:13,988
because they accepted this kind of nonsense because it was written.

188
00:44:14,096 --> 00:44:17,988
Even today I hear, “In such and such book, such is written;

189
00:44:18,096 --> 00:44:22,988
in that book such and such thing is written.” This is terrible condition.

190
00:44:23,096 --> 00:44:27,988
For example, it’s written in the Bible that Jews crucified Christ.

191
00:44:28,096 --> 00:44:33,988
Nonsense! Just use your brains. How can Jews crucify Christ?

192
00:44:34,096 --> 00:44:35,988
They were in the multitude.

193
00:44:36,096 --> 00:44:41,988
In any country have you heard that a person can be crucified

194
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,988
with the general opinion of the people?

195
00:44:44,096 --> 00:44:47,988
It’s the government, the Roman government did that.

196
00:44:48,096 --> 00:44:51,988
But to put the blame on the Jews was a very good idea

197
00:44:52,096 --> 00:44:54,988
of a very cunning man called as Mr. Paul,

198
00:44:55,096 --> 00:44:59,988
and people accepted that because it suited them to hate the Jews.

199
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:03,988
Then the Jews started creating people like Freud.

200
00:45:04,096 --> 00:45:07,988
So all such conditionings also have reactions,

201
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:11,988
and these conditionings then build up, and once they build up,

202
00:45:12,096 --> 00:45:17,988
their reactions also build up and you have a country full of all kinds of chaos,

203
00:45:18,096 --> 00:45:22,988
fear, violence and destruction.

204
00:45:26,096 --> 00:45:31,988
The conditioning is more also with the idea of possession:

205
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,988
“This is my land.

206
00:45:34,096 --> 00:45:38,988
This possession is mine. That is this, that.”

207
00:45:39,096 --> 00:45:41,988
Like this it goes up to a point where people

208
00:45:42,096 --> 00:45:46,988
who believed in the formless God also fight for the land.

209
00:45:47,096 --> 00:45:50,988
Why should they? They believe in the formless God,

210
00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:53,988
so why should they fight for the land?

211
00:45:54,096 --> 00:45:55,988
But they’ll go on fighting for the land,

212
00:45:56,096 --> 00:46:05,988
and this fighting for the land can go to any extent of very cruel things

213
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:11,988
that whole country can work out.

214
00:46:12,096 --> 00:46:22,988
Conditionings are of every kind, if you see, are blinding your eyes.

215
00:46:23,096 --> 00:46:25,988
For example they believe in Koran.

216
00:46:26,096 --> 00:46:29,988
Simple thing is, Koran was never written by Mohammed Sahib.

217
00:46:30,096 --> 00:46:33,988
He never knew how to read and write.

218
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:36,988
It’s a fact.

219
00:46:37,096 --> 00:46:39,988
For forty years it was not written.

220
00:46:40,096 --> 00:46:43,988
There was a fellow called Mua’wiya or something like that,

221
00:46:44,096 --> 00:46:47,988
who killed Hazrat Ali, his sons.

222
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:53,988
He was the second Calipha; the first one died very early.

223
00:46:54,096 --> 00:46:58,988
Then he killed the third one also.

224
00:46:59,096 --> 00:47:03,988
Then he killed the fourth one, just to become himself the Calipha,

225
00:47:04,096 --> 00:47:08,988
and the liver of this fourth Calipha was eaten

226
00:47:09,096 --> 00:47:14,988
by the mother of this horrible fellow who hated women.

227
00:47:15,096 --> 00:47:19,988
So he puts it down in the Koran, all the things against women,

228
00:47:20,096 --> 00:47:22,988
and people accept it because it’s in the Koran.

229
00:47:23,096 --> 00:47:26,988
Somebody has made fun of Koran and written what's wrong,

230
00:47:27,096 --> 00:47:29,988
and it’s so stupidities, and all that.

231
00:47:30,096 --> 00:47:33,988
So I asked him, "What is the use of writing this book, what is the use?"

232
00:47:34,096 --> 00:47:36,988
He said he never thought of the use.

233
00:47:37,096 --> 00:47:41,988
“Then why did you write? It must have some use. It’s a useless book.”

234
00:47:42,096 --> 00:47:49,988
I said, "It is only useful that, by reading this, all the people who are not Muslims,

235
00:47:50,096 --> 00:48:00,988
will laugh at Islam, and those who are Muslims will say, 'Well, this is our book,

236
00:48:01,096 --> 00:48:05,988
whatever it says we believe in it, we are conditioned like that.'

237
00:48:06,096 --> 00:48:07,988
So you don’t solve the problem."

238
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:09,988
So he said, “Then what should I do?”

239
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:12,988
I said, "You write another book, saying

240
00:48:13,096 --> 00:48:16,988
This is all stupidity I've written of Koran,

241
00:48:17,096 --> 00:48:20,988
because I know it was not written by Mohammed Sahib.'

242
00:48:21,096 --> 00:48:24,988
Don’t write anything Mohammed Sahib, against Him.

243
00:48:25,096 --> 00:48:29,988
He is the One who is the incarnation of Dattatreya. It’s a fact.

244
00:48:30,096 --> 00:48:36,988
So you write that He never wrote it, so all these people have done all these things."

245
00:48:37,096 --> 00:48:41,988
This conditioning can be removed

246
00:48:42,096 --> 00:48:44,988
if you know what sort of life Christ led.

247
00:48:45,096 --> 00:48:46,988
Very important.

248
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:52,988
First of all He was born in a manger.

249
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:59,988
To be born in a manger means in a poor circumstance.

250
00:49:00,096 --> 00:49:03,988
That means He showed there’s no need to have money

251
00:49:04,096 --> 00:49:09,988
or there’s no need to have a huge, big properties

252
00:49:10,096 --> 00:49:14,988
or anything to be impressive on people.

253
00:49:15,096 --> 00:49:24,988
Those were the days where people respected the tapasvis, the ones who were doing tapasya.

254
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:27,988
That was the time to do tapasya.

255
00:49:28,096 --> 00:49:32,988
So He came on this earth and lived like a tapasvi.

256
00:49:36,096 --> 00:49:44,988
On the contrary, the Christians are the most self-indulgent people you could think of.

257
00:49:45,096 --> 00:49:48,988
You go to any Christian nation, you will be amazed

258
00:49:49,096 --> 00:49:56,988
how they are just slaves of money and their watches.

259
00:49:57,096 --> 00:50:03,988
How they are living is very shocking to see they are following Christ.

260
00:50:04,096 --> 00:50:06,988
“Yes, we follow Christ.”

261
00:50:07,096 --> 00:50:09,988
Then follow means what?

262
00:50:10,096 --> 00:50:12,988
He’s there and you are standing backwards moving.

263
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:15,988
Is that the following?

264
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:21,988
If you see the Catholic Church, or even Protestants, you’ll be shocked.

265
00:50:22,096 --> 00:50:26,988
How are they following Christ? I can’t understand, until now I never understood,

266
00:50:27,096 --> 00:50:30,988
because Catholic is nothing but money-oriented.

267
00:50:31,096 --> 00:50:34,988
The only thing they have picked up from Christ that He went to a wedding

268
00:50:35,096 --> 00:50:43,988
and created wine out of water and distributed.

269
00:50:44,096 --> 00:50:51,988
Now this wine is just the juice of the grapes.

270
00:50:52,096 --> 00:50:55,988
It’s also called wine in the Hebrew language.

271
00:50:56,096 --> 00:50:59,988
Thank God I have read Bible in Hebrew translated directly.

272
00:51:00,096 --> 00:51:03,988
So it's called draksharas.

273
00:51:04,096 --> 00:51:10,988
Because instantly, you cannot create alcohol.

274
00:51:11,096 --> 00:51:17,988
It has to rot, rot, rot, and the more it rots, the more good it is, they say.

275
00:51:18,096 --> 00:51:22,988
They write it down, this is twenty-five years old, so is the price is much.

276
00:51:23,096 --> 00:51:26,988
But if it is three hundred year old the price is exorbitant.

277
00:51:27,096 --> 00:51:33,988
So it has to rot and smell like hell, then only it’s a good alcohol. It’s a fact.

278
00:51:34,096 --> 00:51:38,988
How could Christ create that instant, that moment, alcohol?

279
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:42,988
But now what I find is this, that if somebody dies

280
00:51:43,096 --> 00:51:45,988
they will take champagne to celebrate what?

281
00:51:46,096 --> 00:51:52,988
Good riddance of bad rubbish? Or when somebody is born they will do it.

282
00:51:53,096 --> 00:51:56,988
But on Christmas day especially, after coming from church,

283
00:51:57,096 --> 00:52:01,988
don’t go to any Christian’s house.

284
00:52:02,096 --> 00:52:05,988
Even the Indian Christians have started following the Western people,

285
00:52:06,096 --> 00:52:09,988
because Indian Christians believe that Christ was born in England.

286
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:16,988
All such ideas have come from where?

287
00:52:17,096 --> 00:52:23,988
Is because the English and the Portuguese and the French brought Christianity to us.

288
00:52:24,096 --> 00:52:27,988
Now, by any chance, are they Christians?

289
00:52:28,096 --> 00:52:32,988
What business they had to bring Christianity to this place?

290
00:52:35,096 --> 00:52:38,988
They took Christianity to all the places, specially Spanish.

291
00:52:39,096 --> 00:52:43,988
Spanish, Portuguese went round the whole world

292
00:52:44,096 --> 00:52:46,988
to spread Christianity and today is the mess

293
00:52:47,096 --> 00:52:52,988
that you see in those people. They are nothing but drunkards.

294
00:52:53,096 --> 00:53:01,988
Yesterday I was going back, and the sea was full of happiness and joy,

295
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:06,988
and the water had reached a very high level. It happens with Me.

296
00:53:07,096 --> 00:53:10,988
But what I found, there were four, five Christians coming, singing carols,

297
00:53:11,096 --> 00:53:20,988
and just completely drunk, and I was thinking they’ll be drowned in this water very soon.

298
00:53:21,096 --> 00:53:25,988
This was the great boon of Christianity on human beings,

299
00:53:26,096 --> 00:53:29,988
that you can drink as much as you like.

300
00:53:33,096 --> 00:53:37,988
Now this drinking has come, I should say, from where? God alone knows,

301
00:53:38,096 --> 00:53:42,988
but it has come also from the Christians.

302
00:53:43,096 --> 00:53:45,988
And the Muslims also drink, no doubt,

303
00:53:46,096 --> 00:53:48,988
but they hide and drink.

304
00:53:49,096 --> 00:53:53,988
They don’t openly drink and don’t call it's a religious duty that you should drink.

305
00:53:54,096 --> 00:53:56,988
Imagine in the church when they give communication,

306
00:53:57,096 --> 00:54:01,988
they give you some sort of a dirty smelling wine.

307
00:54:02,096 --> 00:54:04,988
After that, how can you have communication?

308
00:54:05,096 --> 00:54:08,988
Once you are drunk you are finished.

309
00:54:09,096 --> 00:54:11,988
But all these things happen.

310
00:54:12,096 --> 00:54:14,988
So today we are talking about Christ.

311
00:54:15,096 --> 00:54:22,988
He is sitting in a position of Agnya Chakra,

312
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:27,988
controlling pineal and pituitary.

313
00:54:28,096 --> 00:54:32,988
By that He controls our conditioning.

314
00:54:33,096 --> 00:54:39,988
If we follow Him then we cannot be conditioned by anything,

315
00:54:40,096 --> 00:54:42,988
because He talked of Spirit only.

316
00:54:43,096 --> 00:54:49,988
Spirit cannot be conditioned - conditioned by anything.

317
00:54:50,096 --> 00:54:56,988
Whatever is good that will be accepted, good, congenial to the Spirit.

318
00:55:01,096 --> 00:55:05,988
It’s a different attitude of a person who is spiritual.

319
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:10,988
Like we had people here,

320
00:55:11,096 --> 00:55:15,988
I know they are not very comfortable.

321
00:55:16,096 --> 00:55:19,988
Some of them are put into these tents here and there,

322
00:55:20,096 --> 00:55:29,988
but they are enjoying because they are enjoying the spiritual atmosphere.

323
00:55:30,096 --> 00:55:34,988
They don’t care where they sleep, where they live, what they have.

324
00:55:35,096 --> 00:55:39,988
This is all because you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

325
00:55:40,096 --> 00:55:42,988
But those who have not, so much worried,

326
00:55:43,096 --> 00:55:49,988
“This is not good, I want this way, that way.” All material happiness they seek,

327
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:54,988
trouble everybody, criticize everybody, get angry with everybody.

328
00:55:55,096 --> 00:55:59,988
But actually they haven’t got spiritual joy,

329
00:56:00,096 --> 00:56:07,988
and they can never be really in joy unless and until they become fully spiritual.

330
00:56:08,096 --> 00:56:13,988
Christ has openly said that “You have to know yourself.”

331
00:56:14,096 --> 00:56:16,988
Same in Koran, Mohammed Sahib has said,

332
00:56:17,096 --> 00:56:20,988
“Unless and until you know yourself, you will not know God.”

333
00:56:21,096 --> 00:56:27,988
There are lots of truths in Koran, I find, left over by this Mua’wiya

334
00:56:28,096 --> 00:56:30,988
and also in the Bible.

335
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:36,988
Also in the Jews, I find their Torah and all that has lots of truth,

336
00:56:37,096 --> 00:56:40,988
but is covered by all this kind of thinking,

337
00:56:41,096 --> 00:56:46,988
rationality and adjustments they have done for their own use.

338
00:56:50,096 --> 00:56:56,988
Actually we have to understand that Christ never started any exclusive religion, never.

339
00:56:57,096 --> 00:57:03,988
None of them. Specially Mohammed Sahib has talked about Abraham;

340
00:57:04,096 --> 00:57:10,988
He’s talked about Moses; He’s talked about Christ and His Mother, much more than in the Bible,

341
00:57:11,096 --> 00:57:12,988
respected Her.

342
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:19,988
And He said, “There have been more than one lakh walis (means realized souls) before.”

343
00:57:20,096 --> 00:57:26,988
But still Muslims are some sort of a unique people

344
00:57:27,096 --> 00:57:30,988
because they call themselves Muslims. Whether they drink, doesn’t matter;

345
00:57:31,096 --> 00:57:33,988
whether they womanize, doesn’t matter;

346
00:57:34,096 --> 00:57:35,988
they kill people, doesn’t matter.

347
00:57:36,096 --> 00:57:39,988
They are running after few things which are forbidden to them,

348
00:57:40,096 --> 00:57:41,988
but still they are Muslims.

349
00:57:42,096 --> 00:57:43,988
Same with the Christians.

350
00:57:44,096 --> 00:57:54,988
Difficult to find a man who is a real Christian, who follows Christ, before realization.

351
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:57,988
After realization, of course, we are different,

352
00:57:58,096 --> 00:58:00,988
but for that you have to cross this Agnya.

353
00:58:01,096 --> 00:58:08,988
Agnya also is there which has to control your ego.

354
00:58:09,096 --> 00:58:13,988
Christ in His lifetime showed how ego works.

355
00:58:14,096 --> 00:58:21,988
His own crucifixion itself shows how Christ,

356
00:58:22,096 --> 00:58:26,988
such a great incarnation of purity, was crucified;

357
00:58:27,096 --> 00:58:31,988
shows what people are like,

358
00:58:32,096 --> 00:58:37,988
what they did to Him, how He was troubled

359
00:58:38,096 --> 00:58:40,988
and tortured by these stupid people

360
00:58:41,096 --> 00:58:45,988
and then how He was crucified by the government.

361
00:58:48,096 --> 00:58:52,988
In the beginning there were many Sahaja Yogis, I should say, they were called as Gnostics.

362
00:58:53,096 --> 00:59:00,988
"Gna” in Sanskrit means knowledge, who had the knowledge about self.

363
00:59:01,096 --> 00:59:06,988
Christ has said, “Thou shalt.” He has said that “Know thyself.”

364
00:59:07,096 --> 00:59:10,988
"You have to knock at the door,” meaning

365
00:59:11,096 --> 00:59:13,988
you must have Shuddha Iccha, otherwise it won’t work out.

366
00:59:14,096 --> 00:59:19,988
Nobody can force you. He controls the ego.

367
00:59:22,096 --> 00:59:26,988
He’s the One who gives you the balance,

368
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:30,988
but if you go to the West you know they are nothing

369
00:59:31,096 --> 00:59:35,988
but some sort of a stupid donkey-like ego.

370
00:59:36,096 --> 00:59:37,988


371
00:59:38,096 --> 00:59:45,988
The way they talk, the way they behave towards each other, it’s a big eye opener.

372
00:59:46,096 --> 00:59:49,988
They are developed. How are they developed? God knows.

373
00:59:50,096 --> 00:59:54,988
Oh, they are very advanced, sophisticated, this, that.

374
00:59:55,096 --> 00:59:56,988


375
00:59:57,096 --> 01:00:03,988
With this Agnya catching. Christ has said in His Lord’s Prayer:

376
01:00:04,096 --> 01:00:12,988
“Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them who trespass against us.”

377
01:00:13,096 --> 01:00:17,988
What a big thing to say, but one thing I have seen in the West,

378
01:00:18,096 --> 01:00:19,988
people don’t know how to forgive.

379
01:00:20,096 --> 01:00:23,988
They are full of hatred

380
01:00:24,096 --> 01:00:25,988


381
01:00:26,096 --> 01:00:33,988
and they cannot ask forgiveness because they are full of terrible ego.

382
01:00:34,096 --> 01:00:38,988
Though they will feel guilty, but they will never ask for forgiveness.

383
01:00:39,096 --> 01:00:44,988
They’ll never say that “Oh God, forgive me for what I have done. ”

384
01:00:45,096 --> 01:00:47,988
This is so common now.

385
01:00:48,096 --> 01:00:51,988
For example the Nazis, they killed so many people

386
01:00:52,096 --> 01:00:57,988
and still you find these Neo-Nazis coming up, even in Italy.

387
01:00:58,096 --> 01:01:01,988


388
01:01:02,096 --> 01:01:05,988
They are not ashamed as to what they have done.

389
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:12,988
This happens because there is no really connection with Christ.

390
01:01:13,096 --> 01:01:16,988
Firstly, if you have connection with Christ,

391
01:01:17,096 --> 01:01:21,988
your ego has to be finished, absolutely.

392
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:28,988
And this ego which comes to you from various sources is a myth. Is a myth.

393
01:01:29,096 --> 01:01:31,988


394
01:01:32,096 --> 01:01:37,988
With this ego people try to befool others and show off.

395
01:01:38,096 --> 01:01:42,988
Like there’s a story of Shahpesh- I don’t know if you have read about him.

396
01:01:43,096 --> 01:01:46,988
He came to a king and told him that “I’m a great architect,

397
01:01:47,096 --> 01:01:49,988
and I’ll build a big palace for you, ”and this and that.

398
01:01:50,096 --> 01:01:52,988
The way he posed, the king believed him.

399
01:01:53,096 --> 01:01:56,988
He said, “All right. Go ahead, I’ll send you so much money. ”

400
01:01:57,096 --> 01:02:03,988
Now with this whole attitude and the way he was describing himself,

401
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:07,988
with his all his gestures full of such ego

402
01:02:08,096 --> 01:02:14,988
that this king also got completely lost. He gave him lots of money.

403
01:02:15,096 --> 01:02:20,988
And in six months' time he came back, said, “I’ve built your palace, come and have a look.”

404
01:02:21,096 --> 01:02:26,988
So he went there, he saw it was just the same land, there was no palace, nothing.

405
01:02:27,096 --> 01:02:29,988
So the king thought something gone wrong with him or what?

406
01:02:30,096 --> 01:02:35,988
He was again looking and looking, and what does he find? He finds there was no palace, nothing.

407
01:02:36,096 --> 01:02:40,988
Immediately he realized that his ego has befooled him.

408
01:02:41,096 --> 01:02:46,988
So the king was very clever that way, he realized it.

409
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:52,988
So he started saying, “See this is the main road by which we’ll go, and there’s the palace.

410
01:02:53,096 --> 01:02:55,988
Now the door opens. ”Nothing there.

411
01:02:56,096 --> 01:02:59,988
It's all just a story. “And now here is your throne,

412
01:03:00,096 --> 01:03:01,988
and please be seated on it.”

413
01:03:02,096 --> 01:03:04,988
He said, “First you sit.”

414
01:03:05,096 --> 01:03:14,988
He made this Shahpesh to sit on a throne which never existed. Now imagine, it was very painful.

415
01:03:15,096 --> 01:03:19,988
He said, “You see, I want to see you sitting there, I like it.”

416
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:21,988
For one hour he made him sit.

417
01:03:22,096 --> 01:03:27,988
For two hours he made him sit. Ultimately Shahpesh fell at his feet and he said,

418
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:34,988
“Sir, I’m sorry, there is no palace, there is no throne, nothing of the kind,”

419
01:03:35,096 --> 01:03:38,988
but the king had lost all his money so he imprisoned him,

420
01:03:39,096 --> 01:03:41,988
he was beaten up and did all kinds of things.

421
01:03:42,096 --> 01:03:47,988
So this is the end of false ideas about oneself.

422
01:03:48,096 --> 01:03:54,988
This ego can take you to such a heights of stupidity.

423
01:03:55,096 --> 01:03:57,988


424
01:03:58,096 --> 01:04:04,988
And the culture where it is pampered is the worst culture.

425
01:04:05,096 --> 01:04:07,988
I’ve seen advertisements where they say,

426
01:04:08,096 --> 01:04:14,988
"You must smoke this particular cigarette because it expresses your ego."

427
01:04:15,096 --> 01:04:16,988


428
01:04:17,096 --> 01:04:28,988
But according to Indian culture, to express your ego is absolutely something very stupid.

429
01:04:29,096 --> 01:04:34,988
People laugh at such a person, the one who tries to show his ego.

430
01:04:35,096 --> 01:04:39,988
In Marathi language, if somebody is trying to show off,

431
01:04:40,096 --> 01:04:45,988
then they say he is climbing on a small, little shrub of channa.

432
01:04:46,096 --> 01:04:47,988


433
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:54,988
It’s the whole system is such so nobody can develop any ego.

434
01:04:55,096 --> 01:04:58,988
If they develop, then they are corrected.

435
01:04:59,096 --> 01:05:03,988
Specially in Maharashtra, it’s very difficult to develop any ego.

436
01:05:04,096 --> 01:05:09,988
As soon as you start talking big about yourself, immediately you are punctured.

437
01:05:10,096 --> 01:05:11,988


438
01:05:12,096 --> 01:05:23,988
But in the north, of course, a little bit allowed I think, and people do talk big.

439
01:05:24,096 --> 01:05:26,988
We have great politicians who talk very big,

440
01:05:27,096 --> 01:05:32,988
“I’m going to do this; I’m going to do that. We’re going to have this project, that project, this, that.”

441
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:36,988
One thing: Christ never said such a thing, never He talked.

442
01:05:37,096 --> 01:05:46,988
What, if you see His sermons, is so deep and so enlightening.

443
01:05:47,096 --> 01:05:50,988
Despite the effort of this gentleman Mister Paul,

444
01:05:51,096 --> 01:05:54,988
you see Christ talking to people,

445
01:05:55,096 --> 01:06:03,988
giving them different ways of explanation: what happens after realization,

446
01:06:04,096 --> 01:06:07,988
how a seed is sprouted, and how it can get spoilt.

447
01:06:08,096 --> 01:06:12,988
And very beautifully He explained to people.

448
01:06:13,096 --> 01:06:16,988
I think it didn't have much effect at that time.

449
01:06:17,096 --> 01:06:37,988
0

450
01:06:38,096 --> 01:06:41,988
His life was so charming and so beautiful.

451
01:06:42,096 --> 01:06:43,988


452
01:06:44,096 --> 01:06:49,988
Like a shooting star, He came on this earth,

453
01:06:50,096 --> 01:06:58,988
but He left such a remarkable impression on people.

454
01:06:59,096 --> 01:07:01,988
His crucifixion was a part of the game

455
01:07:02,096 --> 01:07:07,988
because He had to make the way in the Agnya Chakra,

456
01:07:08,096 --> 01:07:11,988
to cross the Agnya Chakra He was crucified;

457
01:07:12,096 --> 01:07:16,988
but His message is not crucifixion.

458
01:07:17,096 --> 01:07:20,988
People wear the cross and I feel very hurt about it.

459
01:07:21,096 --> 01:07:25,988
He crucified Himself, but that’s not the message,

460
01:07:26,096 --> 01:07:33,988
that’s not you should celebrate that He crucified. There are people who celebrate it.

461
01:07:34,096 --> 01:07:37,988
You have to celebrate His resurrection,

462
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:44,988
resurrection because human beings are to be resurrected.

463
01:07:45,096 --> 01:07:47,988
In Sahaja Yoga nobody is crucified

464
01:07:48,096 --> 01:07:52,988
and is resurrected because of one crucifixion of Christ.

465
01:07:53,096 --> 01:07:56,988
That was enough. That was sufficient.

466
01:07:57,096 --> 01:08:01,988
You can’t carry the cross on your shoulder; don’t have to.

467
01:08:02,096 --> 01:08:04,988
He has carried for you, He’s done everything for you.

468
01:08:05,096 --> 01:08:08,988
He said also that He died for all the sinners, is a fact. If

469
01:08:09,096 --> 01:08:14,988
He had not done that, it would have been difficult to open your Agnyas,

470
01:08:15,096 --> 01:08:18,988
because two problems, I told you, this conditioning and ego.

471
01:08:19,096 --> 01:08:21,988


472
01:08:22,096 --> 01:08:24,988
His crucifixion has helped

473
01:08:25,096 --> 01:08:33,988
the loosening of these two horrible capacities of human being.

474
01:08:34,096 --> 01:08:36,988


475
01:08:37,096 --> 01:08:48,988
His life is to be understood in a very, very deep sense.

476
01:08:49,096 --> 01:08:50,988


477
01:08:51,096 --> 01:08:53,988
But if you are like a journalist, you can say,

478
01:08:54,096 --> 01:09:01,988
“Why did He crucify Himself? If He was God why did He get crucified?”

479
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:02,988


480
01:09:03,096 --> 01:09:05,988
Now the question is why He got crucified,

481
01:09:06,096 --> 01:09:10,988
is how to tell these journalists who don’t know anything about chakras.

482
01:09:11,096 --> 01:09:19,988
Because it was the era or the time of tapasya, of sacrifice, and so

483
01:09:20,096 --> 01:09:31,988
then all these three persons - Buddha, Mahavira and Christ - went into complete renunciation.

484
01:09:32,096 --> 01:09:34,988


485
01:09:35,096 --> 01:09:40,988
They led a life of a great tapasvis.

486
01:09:41,096 --> 01:09:46,988
They did it for us, not for themselves. They didn’t need it.

487
01:09:47,096 --> 01:09:53,988
They didn’t want it; but they had do it to cleanse us,

488
01:09:54,096 --> 01:10:04,988
to give us a proper Medha as they call it this Ekadesha Rudras,

489
01:10:05,096 --> 01:10:07,988
you see, to be cleared out;

490
01:10:08,096 --> 01:10:14,988
and they have sacrificed their lives, they have sacrificed all the pleasures of life.

491
01:10:15,096 --> 01:10:20,988
For them it was not a sacrifice, it is just a kind of a life they wanted to have.

492
01:10:21,096 --> 01:10:28,988
For such people there’s no question of sacrifice, but is a question of doing something

493
01:10:29,096 --> 01:10:35,988
that would help to open the chakras of the people in the future.

494
01:10:36,096 --> 01:10:38,988
Without them we could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga.

495
01:10:39,096 --> 01:10:48,988
It was essential for these people to cleanse for us these three chakras,

496
01:10:49,096 --> 01:10:53,988
part of the one Chakra of Christ.

497
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:55,988


498
01:10:56,096 --> 01:11:06,988
All this they have worked out, and that's why today Sahaja Yoga is so beautifully created,

499
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:13,988
so beautifully spreading, is working out. We have to thank them very much.

500
01:11:14,096 --> 01:11:16,988
Of course all other incarnations also have helped,

501
01:11:17,096 --> 01:11:22,988
you can see, Vishuddhi, then also heart, and all these - right heart, left heart -

502
01:11:23,096 --> 01:11:27,988
all these angels as they are called in the Bible,

503
01:11:28,096 --> 01:11:30,988
have helped us to cross over.

504
01:11:31,096 --> 01:11:35,988
All these incarnations are responsible in our evolutionary process

505
01:11:36,096 --> 01:11:39,988
to create these ladders for us to move.

506
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:41,988


507
01:11:42,096 --> 01:11:49,988
So, ultimately you reach the state of Tapah

508
01:11:50,096 --> 01:11:56,988
on the sixth center and then in the state of truth, Satya.

509
01:11:57,096 --> 01:12:02,988
Then the truth comes to you through Sahaja Yoga, in the brain,

510
01:12:03,096 --> 01:12:07,988
in the limbic area when the Kundalini enters, She puts light there,

511
01:12:08,096 --> 01:12:12,988
She creates enlightened personalities

512
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:18,988
and then She joins this all-pervading power of divine love,

513
01:12:19,096 --> 01:12:27,988
and with this divine love you are completely changed and transformed.

514
01:12:28,096 --> 01:12:29,988


515
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:38,988
So their contribution to the ascent of human beings has been great,

516
01:12:39,096 --> 01:12:41,988
and that of Christ has been the greatest.

517
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:47,988
And when we say we have to follow Christ,

518
01:12:48,096 --> 01:12:53,988
we should try to see how much detachment we have.

519
01:12:54,096 --> 01:12:55,988


520
01:12:56,096 --> 01:13:00,988
They say His brothers and sisters, or somebody came to see Him.

521
01:13:01,096 --> 01:13:05,988
They say He had brothers. So He said, “Who are My brothers?

522
01:13:06,096 --> 01:13:09,988
These are My brothers, these are My relations.”

523
01:13:10,096 --> 01:13:15,988
Gyaneshwara said the same thing, that "They will become your relations

524
01:13:16,096 --> 01:13:21,988
[Marathi, sounds like SO ERIKO, TE CHEEZ SO ERIKO TE]. They will be your relations,

525
01:13:22,096 --> 01:13:27,988
they'll be your brothers and sisters, and not those who are not enlightened.

526
01:13:28,096 --> 01:13:30,988
They are not your relations because they don’t understand you.

527
01:13:31,096 --> 01:13:38,988
They don’t have entry into the Kingdom of God,

528
01:13:39,096 --> 01:13:51,988
so they are not your relations." In His lifetime, He led a life of a person who was very simple.

529
01:13:52,096 --> 01:13:54,988
Didn’t bother about clothes or anything.

530
01:13:55,096 --> 01:13:58,988
All the conditioning of the worldly things were not His,

531
01:13:59,096 --> 01:14:05,988
but He was not shameless type of a person who would accept any kind of a nudity and this and that.

532
01:14:06,096 --> 01:14:11,988
Even about Mahavira there’s a big misconcept.

533
01:14:12,096 --> 01:14:20,988
He was once praying in a garden where there were lots of bushes, we call them kunjas,

534
01:14:21,096 --> 01:14:27,988
and in the bush His cloth, which was only one cloth He was putting on, was caught up.

535
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:30,988
So He cut half of it and was covering Himself.

536
01:14:31,096 --> 01:14:38,988
Shri Krishna went to test Him, and He said that “I have nothing, I am just nude,

537
01:14:39,096 --> 01:14:45,988
so why don’t you give Me your cloth? Because, after all, You are a king.”

538
01:14:46,096 --> 01:14:55,988
So He took out his cloth and gave it to Shri Krishna, and got some leaves to cover Himself

539
01:14:56,096 --> 01:14:59,988
and He was in His own garden, and went into His own palace.

540
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:07,988
Now, if you see the Jains, they make everything so horrible and insult Him all the time.

541
01:15:08,096 --> 01:15:15,988
Most of the people who follow all these great incarnations really all the time insult them.

542
01:15:16,096 --> 01:15:17,988


543
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:22,988
They don’t follow, they insult, and by their behavior, you see,

544
01:15:23,096 --> 01:15:27,988
we form such a bad opinion of all these people.

545
01:15:28,096 --> 01:15:28,988


546
01:15:29,096 --> 01:15:32,988
I met one gentleman in Chicago. It was very cold.

547
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:36,988
He was the head of the Hare Rama Hare Krishna.

548
01:15:37,096 --> 01:15:42,988
He was wearing a dhoti which was so thin, and he was shaking before Me.

549
01:15:43,096 --> 01:15:46,988
I said, “What’s the matter?”

550
01:15:47,096 --> 01:15:48,988
He said, “I’m feeling very cold.”

551
01:15:49,096 --> 01:15:50,988
I said, “Why are you wearing this dhoti?”

552
01:15:51,096 --> 01:15:55,988
He said, “My guru has told me if you wear a dhoti you will go to heaven.”

553
01:15:56,096 --> 01:16:01,988
I said, “Really? In India eighty percent people wear nothing but dhotis,

554
01:16:02,096 --> 01:16:04,988
are they all going to go to heaven? And many must have gone already,

555
01:16:05,096 --> 01:16:08,988
so where will you be?” Didn’t like it.

556
01:16:09,096 --> 01:16:14,988
Then I said, "Why you shaved your hair and put this …”we call it shindi, or in Hindi, bhodi.

557
01:16:15,096 --> 01:16:19,988
I don’t know what you call - pig’s tail here, pig’s tail?

558
01:16:20,096 --> 01:16:22,988
So he says, “It is because my guru told me

559
01:16:23,096 --> 01:16:28,988
that I must shave my head and have this kind of a thing.” So I think perhaps,

560
01:16:29,096 --> 01:16:34,988
maybe he will be tied to some rope and pulled in the heaven or something,

561
01:16:35,096 --> 01:16:36,988


562
01:16:37,096 --> 01:16:48,988
I said. Kabira has said - Kabira was one of them who has tried to slash out all your conditioning.

563
01:16:49,096 --> 01:16:53,988
He said, “By shaving your head, if you are going to go to heaven,

564
01:16:54,096 --> 01:16:56,988


565
01:16:57,096 --> 01:17:05,988
so what about the lamb which is shaved twice a year?

566
01:17:06,096 --> 01:17:09,988
He’ll be there earlier than you.”

567
01:17:10,096 --> 01:17:11,988
It’s a fact, it's so, such stupid things.

568
01:17:12,096 --> 01:17:17,988
And there are Jain sadhus who will remain absolutely nude and will pull their hair.

569
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:25,988
Now by law they are allowed to go nude on the street, you know, insulting everyone.

570
01:17:26,096 --> 01:17:30,988
All such stupid things are happening in the name of religion -

571
01:17:31,096 --> 01:17:34,988
that, too, of Buddha, Mahavira, and Christ.

572
01:17:35,096 --> 01:17:36,988


573
01:17:37,096 --> 01:17:44,988
They are the Ones who are trying to pull us away from rationality,

574
01:17:45,096 --> 01:17:47,988
because you have to cross this.

575
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:57,988
All your limitations are because of this thinking, conditioning.

576
01:17:58,096 --> 01:18:04,988
We have to go beyond because by thinking, what do we do?

577
01:18:05,096 --> 01:18:09,988
We move in a linear way and then there’s no truth in it,

578
01:18:10,096 --> 01:18:15,988
so the whole thing comes back, boomerangs, and you are finished.

579
01:18:16,096 --> 01:18:20,988
We have to go beyond this mind; must understand this point is.

580
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:26,988
Christ has done this so that we can go beyond our mind.

581
01:18:27,096 --> 01:18:27,988


582
01:18:28,096 --> 01:18:30,988
If you don’t know how to go beyond mind,

583
01:18:31,096 --> 01:18:33,988
better sit down for your meditation, work it out.

584
01:18:34,096 --> 01:18:36,988
With this mind all kinds of things will come.

585
01:18:37,096 --> 01:18:43,988
Temper will come, intrigue will come, jealousies will come,

586
01:18:44,096 --> 01:18:54,988
all the six enemies that we have will come to us through this mind –

587
01:18:55,096 --> 01:19:00,988
means thinking, rationality. Everything can be rationalized.

588
01:19:01,096 --> 01:19:04,988
“Why did you murder your wife?”

589
01:19:05,096 --> 01:19:07,988
"Because I hated her. She was this, she was that, she was that.”

590
01:19:08,096 --> 01:19:10,988
But you cannot murder her.

591
01:19:11,096 --> 01:19:14,988
“Why did you murder your husband?” “Because of this, because of that.”

592
01:19:15,096 --> 01:19:22,988
Because of this mind we start doing things which are absolutely wrong, which are sinful,

593
01:19:23,096 --> 01:19:25,988
and then we try to rationalize it.

594
01:19:26,096 --> 01:19:31,988
Go against Agnya, go against reality,

595
01:19:32,096 --> 01:19:37,988
and then use your conditioning, use your, we can call,

596
01:19:38,096 --> 01:19:46,988
the ego to explain it, why you did it.

597
01:19:47,096 --> 01:19:51,988
All the time when we are doing like that we can never go beyond mind.

598
01:19:52,096 --> 01:19:57,988
We are so self-satisfied about ourselves. We think no end of ourselves.

599
01:19:58,096 --> 01:20:06,988
Now, how are we to get out of it?

600
01:20:07,096 --> 01:20:09,988
Introspection.

601
01:20:10,096 --> 01:20:13,988
But it’s very difficult because people are afraid of themselves.

602
01:20:14,096 --> 01:20:18,988
They don’t want to introspect, because once they start introspecting they

603
01:20:19,096 --> 01:20:25,988
will know how sinful they have been, how wrong things they have been doing.

604
01:20:26,096 --> 01:20:31,988
And then they’ll hate themselves. So they don’t want to introspect.

605
01:20:32,096 --> 01:20:38,988
But it’s very important that we should introspect.

606
01:20:39,096 --> 01:20:50,988
That introspection is very helpful for you to overcome these two hurdles of your Agnya Chakra.

607
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,988


608
01:20:53,096 --> 01:20:57,988
I’ve told you many a times: don’t argue with anybody

609
01:20:58,096 --> 01:21:02,988
because the other fellow, he is asking for argument is the one has lots of ego,

610
01:21:03,096 --> 01:21:07,988
and that ego is acting on you.

611
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:16,988
So action/reaction starts, and we develop a habit of reacting to everything.

612
01:21:17,096 --> 01:21:21,988
Specially in the West, I have seen they react to everything, everything.

613
01:21:22,096 --> 01:21:25,988
For example, now, this thing is spread out here, now they have nothing to do.

614
01:21:26,096 --> 01:21:29,988
“But they could have had better, why is it so thin?”

615
01:21:30,096 --> 01:21:33,988
Well you pay for it now, you do it.

616
01:21:34,096 --> 01:21:36,988
They are walking across, they meet someone. "See, see this man.

617
01:21:37,096 --> 01:21:40,988
What sort of a person he is?”

618
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:44,988
If there’s a beggar, then they’ll start criticizing.

619
01:21:45,096 --> 01:21:48,988
They'll criticize the government; they’ll criticize everyone.

620
01:21:49,096 --> 01:21:50,988
What about yourself?

621
01:21:51,096 --> 01:21:55,988
Instead of that why don’t you start doing something about it?

622
01:21:56,096 --> 01:22:01,988
If you can’t help it, if you are not going to do anything about it, why react?

623
01:22:02,096 --> 01:22:05,988
And this is the worst habit we have developed is to react,

624
01:22:06,096 --> 01:22:08,988
and we think we have every right to react.

625
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:17,988
You have, but this right is self-destructive.

626
01:22:18,096 --> 01:22:22,988
To react on everything is not proper.

627
01:22:23,096 --> 01:22:27,988
You have no authority to react. It is to that extent.

628
01:22:28,096 --> 01:22:32,988
You have to just witness, witness the whole thing.

629
01:22:33,096 --> 01:22:35,988
Once you start witnessing,

630
01:22:36,096 --> 01:22:42,988
you’ll be amazed that you will start seeing the play, play of the maya,

631
01:22:43,096 --> 01:22:47,988
as they call it, and you will see where you stand with it.

632
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:52,988
Witnessing should be developed. All the time, witness.

633
01:22:53,096 --> 01:22:55,988
Am I witnessing?

634
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,988
Many people say that I have very good memory

635
01:22:59,096 --> 01:23:03,988
because I am all the time witnessing.

636
01:23:04,096 --> 01:23:08,988
Everything is recorded within Me like a picture.

637
01:23:09,096 --> 01:23:13,988
And then, when I have to say something, I have to correct something,

638
01:23:14,096 --> 01:23:18,988
all that I have witnessed comes to help Me.

639
01:23:19,096 --> 01:23:20,988


640
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:26,988
First of all, we should not react, react to anything.

641
01:23:27,096 --> 01:23:31,988
Some people are attached, say, to money.

642
01:23:32,096 --> 01:23:34,988
They’ll react, they’ll not give any money,

643
01:23:35,096 --> 01:23:37,988
they’ll keep all the money with themselves.

644
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:41,988
In Sahaja Yoga also it happens.

645
01:23:42,096 --> 01:23:45,988
I’ve seen people who are very, very miserly about money.

646
01:23:46,096 --> 01:23:49,988
Another ones are who try to please others,

647
01:23:50,096 --> 01:23:53,988
then they’ll waste their money on lavish things for nothing at all.

648
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:56,988
There’s no need to waste.

649
01:23:57,096 --> 01:23:58,988


650
01:23:59,096 --> 01:24:07,988
Reaction can come through anything. Seeing something you can react

651
01:24:08,096 --> 01:24:12,988
and you become so engrossed with it that you don’t realize

652
01:24:13,096 --> 01:24:18,988
that you are wasting all your brain energy on nonsensical things.

653
01:24:19,096 --> 01:24:27,988
This reaction comes when you have lost complete sense of judgment.

654
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:35,988
You don’t know what you are losing, what you are gaining by this kind of reaction.

655
01:24:36,096 --> 01:24:44,988
And this reaction is going to destroy your inner being completely,

656
01:24:45,096 --> 01:24:48,988
because all the time you are here and you are there, and you’re there, and you are there,

657
01:24:49,096 --> 01:24:51,988
and you are nowhere here.

658
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:53,988


659
01:24:54,096 --> 01:25:00,988
If you are a very criticizing type of a person, try to stop it completely. Criticize yourself,

660
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:05,988
direct that energy towards yourself. "Who am I to criticize others?

661
01:25:06,096 --> 01:25:09,988
Who am I to react to anything?

662
01:25:10,096 --> 01:25:19,988
”Put a challenge to yourself, and you will see that your ego will subside.

663
01:25:20,096 --> 01:25:23,988


664
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,988
One day somebody came and told Me that

665
01:25:27,096 --> 01:25:31,988
“Mother I feel so angry, I feel like beating everyone.”

666
01:25:32,096 --> 01:25:37,988
I said, “All right, do one thing. Take a chappel and hit on your head. Finished.

667
01:25:38,096 --> 01:25:44,988
That’s the only way you can get rid of this habit that you want to beat others.”

668
01:25:45,096 --> 01:25:50,988
Didn’t like it much, but I think by that he is improved.

669
01:25:51,096 --> 01:25:51,988


670
01:25:52,096 --> 01:26:00,988
Now, conditioning also should be seen. “Am I a conditioned person?

671
01:26:01,096 --> 01:26:05,988
If my conditioning is there, then is it a good conditioning or a bad conditioning?

672
01:26:06,096 --> 01:26:08,988
“At least you should have good conditioning.

673
01:26:09,096 --> 01:26:10,988
But even that, to an extreme if you go,

674
01:26:11,096 --> 01:26:15,988
you can create a problem for yourself and for others.

675
01:26:16,096 --> 01:26:21,988
Most of these rituals and things started as a good conditioning.

676
01:26:22,096 --> 01:26:31,988
Then it became like a trap, and they could not get out of it.

677
01:26:32,096 --> 01:26:36,988
It’s a part and parcel of it, one has to accept.

678
01:26:37,096 --> 01:26:39,988
Then what should we do?

679
01:26:40,096 --> 01:26:48,988
We should not react. Just see the drama and you’ll be surprised,

680
01:26:49,096 --> 01:26:49,988


681
01:26:50,096 --> 01:26:56,988
without paying anything, without going to any theatre, every moment you can see the drama going on before you,

682
01:26:57,096 --> 01:27:03,988
which is so enjoyable, whether it is absurd, whether it is ridiculous,

683
01:27:04,096 --> 01:27:12,988
whether it is a sort of a - as you see in the films, you see, beating somebody and all that,

684
01:27:13,096 --> 01:27:19,988
you just see it and you do not react.

685
01:27:20,096 --> 01:27:27,988
Anything that you think is very perverse, ugly, immoral - don’t see, finished, gone.

686
01:27:28,096 --> 01:27:29,988


687
01:27:30,096 --> 01:27:35,988
So don’t tax your mind, because in the mind that we call it, so-called mind,

688
01:27:36,096 --> 01:27:47,988
it's actually the Agnya Chakra in the center of your optic chiasma.

689
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:51,988
Just imagine. What a central place it has!

690
01:27:52,096 --> 01:27:56,988
And any disturbance to your Agnya, what it can do to your brain

691
01:27:57,096 --> 01:28:02,988
which is nothing but a lump of fat.

692
01:28:03,096 --> 01:28:04,988


693
01:28:05,096 --> 01:28:07,988
So how this Agnya can affect you,

694
01:28:08,096 --> 01:28:15,988
and how it works and creates perverted images, that is to be really seen.

695
01:28:16,096 --> 01:28:24,988
Conditionings, also you have seen, people are mentally so upset and so degenerated.

696
01:28:25,096 --> 01:28:26,988


697
01:28:27,096 --> 01:28:33,988
But the pure nature of Christ is innocence, you know that. He's Shri Ganesha.

698
01:28:34,096 --> 01:28:38,988
Shri Ganesha is an eternal Child.

699
01:28:39,096 --> 01:28:44,988
Christ is also complete innocence because He doesn’t react,

700
01:28:45,096 --> 01:28:47,988


701
01:28:48,096 --> 01:28:52,988
because He is not conditioned.

702
01:28:53,096 --> 01:28:56,988
Children are not conditioned so much as we are.

703
01:28:57,096 --> 01:28:58,988


704
01:28:59,096 --> 01:29:01,988
If you talk to children, if you speak to them,

705
01:29:02,096 --> 01:29:08,988
you’ll be amazed how innocent they are and how innocently they talk.

706
01:29:09,096 --> 01:29:16,988
Once My granddaughter asked Me, “What do You think of the poor children of the tiger?”

707
01:29:17,096 --> 01:29:18,988
I said, “Why?”

708
01:29:19,096 --> 01:29:27,988
“You know their father tells them that ‘You eat human beings,’ and what can they do?

709
01:29:28,096 --> 01:29:32,988
They have to eat human beings after all.” You see, so innocent.

710
01:29:33,096 --> 01:29:37,988
So I told her that they are under a complete control of God.

711
01:29:38,096 --> 01:29:42,988
Whatever they are doing, they are not going to be held responsible.

712
01:29:43,096 --> 01:29:45,988
It’s only for human beings

713
01:29:46,096 --> 01:29:54,988


714
01:29:55,096 --> 01:29:58,988
that God has given this freedom.

715
01:29:59,096 --> 01:30:05,988
It’s only human beings who can react in this manner.

716
01:30:06,096 --> 01:30:09,988
So for animals it is, they are pashus,

717
01:30:10,096 --> 01:30:15,988
means they are completely under the control of the God Almighty.

718
01:30:16,096 --> 01:30:20,988
So they are swabhavas, everything, a serpent will be a serpent,

719
01:30:21,096 --> 01:30:26,988
and a tiger will be a tiger, and they will say a lion will be a lion.

720
01:30:27,096 --> 01:30:31,988
But human being can be a serpent, at the same time could be a scorpion,

721
01:30:32,096 --> 01:30:34,988
could be a lion, could be anything,

722
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:41,988
you know suddenly you find a small little bug-like man coming up like a lion roaring at you,

723
01:30:42,096 --> 01:30:46,988
and you say, “From where does this come, this cannon?”

724
01:30:47,096 --> 01:30:50,988
It is so. You don’t know which way they will come,

725
01:30:51,096 --> 01:30:56,988
and which way the camel will sit. You can’t say.

726
01:30:57,096 --> 01:31:04,988
So this reaction of human beings comes

727
01:31:05,096 --> 01:31:09,988
because he is not in connection with the Divine.

728
01:31:10,096 --> 01:31:14,988
When he is in the connection with the Divine,

729
01:31:15,096 --> 01:31:19,988
he sees the drama, and he leaves everything to Divine.

730
01:31:20,096 --> 01:31:22,988
He can solve all his problem by just one bandhan.

731
01:31:23,096 --> 01:31:26,988


732
01:31:27,096 --> 01:31:33,988
He can solve all the problems just by a bandhan.

733
01:31:34,096 --> 01:31:39,988
But he should be in full connection with the Divine.

734
01:31:40,096 --> 01:31:47,988
It works, it works. It does work. This is not the time when Christ came on this earth.

735
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:58,988
This is the time where this Paramchaitanya has gone into action – activated,

736
01:31:59,096 --> 01:32:00,988
is working out everything.

737
01:32:01,096 --> 01:32:07,988
Now they asked Me about this Shri Ganesha, whether Shri Ganesha drank milk or not.

738
01:32:08,096 --> 01:32:09,988
I said, “Anything possible.”

739
01:32:10,096 --> 01:32:14,988
These days this Paramachaitanya is doing such things, unbelievable things,

740
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:21,988
which we cannot understand, everything is a chamatkar. So it’s possible.

741
01:32:22,096 --> 01:32:22,988


742
01:32:23,096 --> 01:32:27,988
Ganeshas, I’ve never heard of Ganesha liking milk so much,

743
01:32:28,096 --> 01:32:33,988
but maybe for the little rat He might be taking. Can’t say.

744
01:32:34,096 --> 01:32:35,988
“But why did Shiva drink?”

745
01:32:36,096 --> 01:32:39,988
I said, “Let it be, let Shiva wants to drink, let Him have milk.”

746
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:42,988
Actually we have too much milk production,

747
01:32:43,096 --> 01:32:44,988
so They must be wanting to consume some.

748
01:32:45,096 --> 01:32:49,988
But it’s just a way at looking at things that, you see,

749
01:32:50,096 --> 01:32:53,988
when everything is done by this Paramchaitanya.

750
01:32:54,096 --> 01:32:55,988
They are doing such wonderful things,

751
01:32:56,096 --> 01:32:58,988
I mean, I never asked Them to do anything.

752
01:32:59,096 --> 01:33:01,988
But now, for example, in Brisbane when I was there,

753
01:33:02,096 --> 01:33:08,988
I was sleeping in the ashram, and a rainbow appeared.

754
01:33:09,096 --> 01:33:11,988
Of course I like paintings very much, of Raphael specially,

755
01:33:12,096 --> 01:33:16,988
because he has drawn the Mother’s face,

756
01:33:17,096 --> 01:33:19,988
and the Child’s face so exactly,

757
01:33:20,096 --> 01:33:23,988
expressing the feeling of mother and the child.

758
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:28,988
And imagine, that picture appears in the sky,

759
01:33:29,096 --> 01:33:31,988
and I didn’t tell them to show that Raphael.

760
01:33:32,096 --> 01:33:35,988
When I was sleeping I was not even going to look at it.

761
01:33:36,096 --> 01:33:42,988
But at this time, the halo that was on the back side of Mary comes upon the head.

762
01:33:43,096 --> 01:33:48,988
Means Raphael himself did it, or, I don’t know. How can I explain?

763
01:33:49,096 --> 01:33:52,988
This Paramchaitanya is doing all kinds of things,

764
01:33:53,096 --> 01:33:58,988
and it does all this just to convince you about Sahaja Yoga.

765
01:33:59,096 --> 01:34:00,988


766
01:34:01,096 --> 01:34:05,988
Because even now there are many who are supposed to be very rational, intelligent,

767
01:34:06,096 --> 01:34:11,988
educated, who don’t want to accept.

768
01:34:12,096 --> 01:34:16,988
After all, if there is a divine power, if there is something like  that and is active,

769
01:34:17,096 --> 01:34:19,988
how can you challenge it?

770
01:34:20,096 --> 01:34:21,988
How can you say no to it?

771
01:34:22,096 --> 01:34:23,988


772
01:34:24,096 --> 01:34:34,988
Because the powers are unlimited, it has gone into every atom and every molecule.

773
01:34:35,096 --> 01:34:37,988


774
01:34:38,096 --> 01:34:42,988
It doesn’t do tricks, like moving this from there to there,

775
01:34:43,096 --> 01:34:50,988
but what it does is to do something which is absolutely impossible.

776
01:34:51,096 --> 01:34:53,988
It is doing.

777
01:34:54,096 --> 01:34:54,988


778
01:34:55,096 --> 01:35:04,988
So for us to believe in this activated Paramchaitanya

779
01:35:05,096 --> 01:35:06,988
is the only solution.

780
01:35:07,096 --> 01:35:09,988
So you leave it in the ocean of bliss,

781
01:35:10,096 --> 01:35:13,988
and let this great power handle all these situations.

782
01:35:14,096 --> 01:35:17,988
Don’t react yourself.

783
01:35:18,096 --> 01:35:23,988
Which is so efficient, so quick, so fast, moves all over, understands everything,

784
01:35:24,096 --> 01:35:28,988
and it loves you and respects you because you are Sahaja Yogis.

785
01:35:29,096 --> 01:35:32,988


786
01:35:33,096 --> 01:35:39,988
This is what it is today: we should know at the time when we are celebrating Christmas

787
01:35:40,096 --> 01:35:48,988
that what we are celebrating is really our own ascent, our own achievements,

788
01:35:49,096 --> 01:35:56,988
our own lofty heights which we have achieved and which we have to achieve.

789
01:35:57,096 --> 01:36:01,988
We should have only aspirations as far as our spiritual side is concerned.

790
01:36:02,096 --> 01:36:06,988
All aspirations should be left to this Paramchaitanya,

791
01:36:07,096 --> 01:36:08,988
“You look after that.”

792
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:10,988
And the more you become,

793
01:36:11,096 --> 01:36:22,988
the more you develop this non-reacting attitude through your proper Agnya.

794
01:36:23,096 --> 01:36:30,988
Not anger, not silence, but a very pleasant temperament.

795
01:36:31,096 --> 01:36:34,988
That means people think that I have told you not to speak. No, no, you must speak.

796
01:36:35,096 --> 01:36:38,988
You must talk to people, you must laugh, you must enjoy;

797
01:36:39,096 --> 01:36:44,988
but all this should be full of joyous feelings.

798
01:36:45,096 --> 01:36:54,988
That’s what they say that Christmas is for a very joyous atmosphere.

799
01:36:55,096 --> 01:36:58,988
So they can’t do that way so they drink. I mean, after all,

800
01:36:59,096 --> 01:37:02,988
you must give them benefit of doubt also that why do they drink?

801
01:37:03,096 --> 01:37:07,988
They think by drinking they will become joyous.

802
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,988


803
01:37:10,096 --> 01:37:15,988
Now our understanding about ourselves has to be very clear-cut.

804
01:37:16,096 --> 01:37:20,988
Specially, people don’t meditate.

805
01:37:21,096 --> 01:37:24,988
They just don’t meditate. They don’t want to grow.

806
01:37:25,096 --> 01:37:29,988
They are Sahaja Yogis but they don’t meditate. It’s very surprising,

807
01:37:30,096 --> 01:37:35,988
I can make out who meditates, who does not, because there is no depth.

808
01:37:36,096 --> 01:37:42,988
They want to have this, they want to have that, is all right, but what about meditation?

809
01:37:43,096 --> 01:37:49,988
If you don’t meditate, your Agnya will be completely covered with thoughts,

810
01:37:50,096 --> 01:37:55,988
and you’ll be lost. So you have to meditate.

811
01:37:56,096 --> 01:37:59,988
If you don’t meditate, I also suffer.

812
01:38:00,096 --> 01:38:04,988
If you have no aspirations in Sahaja Yoga it's better to leave,

813
01:38:05,096 --> 01:38:10,988
because you are like seeds which are sprouted and which will be wasted.

814
01:38:11,096 --> 01:38:18,988
Some people are here because they want some sort of a platform, some publicity.

815
01:38:19,096 --> 01:38:23,988
Some are here who want money, to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

816
01:38:24,096 --> 01:38:27,988
There are some who want to have a kind of a communication,

817
01:38:28,096 --> 01:38:32,988
to go round the whole world without paying a single pai.

818
01:38:33,096 --> 01:38:40,988
All such people are of no use to themselves.

819
01:38:41,096 --> 01:38:47,988
Now here you have the complete wealth.

820
01:38:48,096 --> 01:38:48,988


821
01:38:49,096 --> 01:38:57,988
All that celestial wealth is before you, and you are not going to accept it,

822
01:38:58,096 --> 01:39:02,988
you are not going to drown into it. What should we say?

823
01:39:03,096 --> 01:39:04,988
It’s not very sensible to do.

824
01:39:05,096 --> 01:39:09,988
As I said, you don’t have to crucify yourself, you don’t have to give up anything,

825
01:39:10,096 --> 01:39:15,988
you don’t have to live like Christ had to live or be born in the manger.

826
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:21,988
All that’s done for you already. Now come along.

827
01:39:22,096 --> 01:39:30,988
But if you are coming in the darbar of the Divine, then be worth it.

828
01:39:31,096 --> 01:39:31,988
You should be worth it.

829
01:39:32,096 --> 01:39:35,988
And you’ll be surprised, all your problems will be solved.

830
01:39:36,096 --> 01:39:43,988
Your self-respect will be maintained. So many things have happened like that,

831
01:39:44,096 --> 01:39:48,988
but if you have no self-respect, you don’t respect your Realization,

832
01:39:49,096 --> 01:39:55,988
you are not deeply involved as to your own ascent and the help to others,

833
01:39:56,096 --> 01:39:57,988
it will not work out.

834
01:39:58,096 --> 01:40:01,988
I’m here to tell you all these things which Christ could not tell.

835
01:40:02,096 --> 01:40:07,988
I had to fulfil what  He wanted to say.

836
01:40:08,096 --> 01:40:12,988
All those things I am saying to you. It has already worked,

837
01:40:13,096 --> 01:40:14,988
you all have got Realization,

838
01:40:15,096 --> 01:40:18,988
but develop respect for yourself as Sahaja yogis.

839
01:40:19,096 --> 01:40:22,988
Don’t have funny ideas about yourself.

840
01:40:23,096 --> 01:40:26,988
Just know you are a Sahaja yogi and a Sahaja yogini.

841
01:40:27,096 --> 01:40:35,988
That’s what is needed for a person if he is today celebrating the birth of Christ.

842
01:40:36,096 --> 01:40:45,988
He came on this Earth who was actually Christ, full of innocence,

843
01:40:46,096 --> 01:40:55,988
who was the One who came as the embodiment of Shri Ganesha.

844
01:40:56,096 --> 01:41:02,988
I have given the proof of it to you, how the carbon atom looks like,

845
01:41:03,096 --> 01:41:08,988
and by which I have proved that Christ is the Alpha and Omega,

846
01:41:09,096 --> 01:41:14,988
while He is made out of Omkara and Swastika.

847
01:41:15,096 --> 01:41:19,988
All this we have experimented. We have found it. It’s there.

848
01:41:20,096 --> 01:41:27,988
With all this, what is the greatest achievement is to respect your innocence.

849
01:41:28,096 --> 01:41:29,988
Respect your innocence.

850
01:41:30,096 --> 01:41:35,988
This is what is to be asked for today: be innocent,

851
01:41:36,096 --> 01:41:40,988
and God looks after all the innocent people.

852
01:41:41,096 --> 01:41:46,988
Don’t worry, don’t have to worry. I’ve seen children falling for seven storeys,

853
01:41:47,096 --> 01:41:48,988
nothing happens to them.

854
01:41:49,096 --> 01:41:53,988
They are perfectly all right. How? Who looks after them? Angels.

855
01:41:54,096 --> 01:41:57,988
You have seen photographs of angels around you.

856
01:41:58,096 --> 01:42:03,988
So try to be simple, innocent, not reactive,

857
01:42:04,096 --> 01:42:12,988
and keep quiet and peaceful because here we are talking about the global transformation

858
01:42:13,096 --> 01:42:15,988
where people will find their peace in their heart

859
01:42:16,096 --> 01:42:25,988
and will establish a new world of peace, joy and spirituality.

860
01:42:26,096 --> 01:42:28,988
May God bless you all!
