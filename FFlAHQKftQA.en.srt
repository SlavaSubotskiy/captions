1
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:49,746
The prophets are born

2
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,502
and create a ripple in our consciousness,

3
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:06,413
a new dimension to our understanding

4
00:08:06,743 --> 00:08:10,559
to religion, dharma;

5
00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:14,862
which has to be assimilated

6
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,035
and has to be understood that,

7
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:21,002
whatever the previous prophets have said,

8
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:26,208
has to be culminated into something else.

9
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:31,383
So as we can say Mohammed Sahib

10
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,864
has said that all these prophets

11
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:40,986
who have come on this earth have created

12
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:49,600
a new ripple and also has sustained human beings

13
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:56,077
with a newer evolution, a newer...

14
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,209
The idea of human beings of newness is that

15
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,183
we have to give up all that is old

16
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:06,667
and we have to become new.

17
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:12,889
Or they think that newness means absolutely a juxtaposition

18
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:16,518
condition in which one has to rise

19
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:22,039
and this is the cause of the folly

20
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:25,822
of many people in the West as well as in the East.

21
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:34,726
Whenever a new theme started, like we can say that first of all

22
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,212
a great saint came on this earth

23
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:45,352
and he found that the people are following

24
00:09:45,702 --> 00:09:48,869
the idol worship in a very wrong way,

25
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:53,905
because it is said in the bible that whatever is created by mother earth

26
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:02,740
should be, should not be reproduced and worshipped.

27
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:09,153
So they created another extreme religion out of it

28
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:12,356
saying that nothing should be worshipped, but it is said whatever is

29
00:10:12,548 --> 00:10:14,840
reproduced by the mother earth.

30
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:20,077
So there are so many such things all over the world

31
00:10:20,582 --> 00:10:23,644
which are created by the mother earth.

32
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,718
So they should not be worshipped

33
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:31,792
by reproducing them and making images out of them.

34
00:10:34,643 --> 00:10:37,442
When such a prophet died

35
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:41,817
saying that, "This should not be done, one should not worship images",

36
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:47,408
the other side of it started, the extreme, going to the extreme that

37
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:52,836
there should be no worship even if the mother earth has created.

38
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:01,024
So all the human beings were divided into extreme conditions.

39
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:04,498
One situation comes in

40
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,788
where one has to say that, "This should not be done."

41
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,515
So people take up that theme and just start building up onto that

42
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:20,486
and saying that: "this should not be done as told by the prophet."

43
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:23,624
Of course after the death of the prophet;

44
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:26,554
when the prophet is living nobody listens to him.

45
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:28,916
They all torture him, bother him,

46
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,153
do all kinds of things and ultimately they may even kill him.

47
00:11:34,322 --> 00:11:36,666
Then another point is: every prophet

48
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:40,811
is born at a different period of time

49
00:11:41,415 --> 00:11:48,541
so depending on the time when he is born he talks of a particular problem.

50
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:52,482
Say when Mohammed was born.

51
00:11:53,304 --> 00:11:58,261
Mohammed Sahib said very clearly that, "You should not drink."

52
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:05,238
So people said that, "All right, we will not drink, but we can smoke."

53
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:09,188
So he had to rectify himself.

54
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:13,643
He'd said: 'I am the last who has come.' but he found that it is not so.

55
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:16,475
So he came back again as Nanaka

56
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:20,347
to tell people that: 'do not smoke also'.

57
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:29,825
Like that the persons or the group of persons who follow one incarnation

58
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,540
go to another extreme

59
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:36,466
and try to push down all the traditions,

60
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:41,555
all that has come so far built up. Like cutting the whole tree

61
00:12:42,204 --> 00:12:44,204
and start their own tree.

62
00:12:44,576 --> 00:12:45,702
Which is artificial.

63
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:50,973
Then the quarrel started

64
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,638
when Mohammed Sahib was driven to another

65
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:59,506
level and then Nanaka's disciples were driven to

66
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:01,455
another level, where they just thought

67
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:04,767
they have no relationship with each other. Which is not truth.

68
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:13,137
Afterwards also you know so many such things have happened

69
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,399
in this world we can see

70
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:16,954
that any revival starts,

71
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:20,511
people go to the extreme of it

72
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:22,871
and get completely ruined.

73
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:27,660
In Christianity you will find the same thing happened,

74
00:13:28,086 --> 00:13:29,699
when Christ came in,

75
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:32,543
whatever problems He faced He talked about them.

76
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:36,569
But the main thing He had to talk about the resurrection,

77
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:41,110
about the ascent and He talked about the ascent.

78
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,329
He talked about the spirit

79
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,181
and in His resurrection He showed that He ascended.

80
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:52,557
But people did not stick to that point.

81
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:56,489
They never thought that you have to ascend in Christianity.

82
00:13:57,665 --> 00:14:01,940
Nobody bothered that you have to ascend. They took a  small little

83
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:03,486
things from somewhere.

84
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:07,213
Also a person came later on

85
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:11,756
called saint Paul who was not at all with Christ or anything.

86
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:14,019
He started a religion of Christianity

87
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,437
which was all absurd, against Christ, anti-Christ.

88
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:25,099
None of these prophets have discarded any prophet who came before them.

89
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:32,650
Now the problem came in that one has to integrate

90
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:38,058
and Mohammed Sahib knew

91
00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:41,413
that a day will come when this integration problem will start

92
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,173
and he talked a lot about Sahaja Yoga in the sense

93
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,170
he said when the resurrection time will come.

94
00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:50,345
He talked more about resurrection than about doom time,

95
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:51,400
most surprising thing is.

96
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:56,468
About Kyama he spoke very little. He spoke really about

97
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:03,326
the resurrection time, because that was the problem.

98
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:06,363
The problem that they face they talk about.

99
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,805
I've told you how Buddha talked

100
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,562
only about Atma Sakshatkar

101
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:13,420
and not about God because those people who went to God,

102
00:15:14,057 --> 00:15:15,317
or thought of God,

103
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:19,696
or just studied God thought they will be gods themselves.

104
00:15:20,971 --> 00:15:22,910
So he said, "You must get your self realization."

105
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:27,809
Then Mahavira who talked about the hell

106
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,161
where people can go,

107
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:31,982
because that was his job,

108
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:35,300
the part of it and the part of it and the part of it and the part of it.

109
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,320
These are the different aspects of human beings

110
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:42,535
which they had to awaken. Different aspects.

111
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:49,467
When Mohammed Sahib started teaching people to do Namas

112
00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:50,547
people used to laugh at him.

113
00:15:50,654 --> 00:15:53,422
What is he doing? Why does he want us to put hands like this?

114
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:57,928
Why does he want us to sit down or put our hands on the knees?

115
00:15:58,512 --> 00:16:02,093
Now you understand as Sahaja Yogis what it means that he wanted us to

116
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:04,422
improve our nabhis first, our dharma first.

117
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:08,231
All this movement was to jerk out

118
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:12,111
the Kundalini, but without realization being there

119
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,503
Namas would not work out.

120
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:16,509
You may break your knees you may do what you like.

121
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,464
But the extremes people catch hold of it and not the reality.

122
00:16:23,097 --> 00:16:26,537
And they make a fuss out of it and they make create a big

123
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:30,123
organizations and things and that's how it is spoiled.

124
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,402
So when he said

125
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,203
that Allah ho Akbar is to be said with your

126
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:37,395
fingers in your ears you all say that isn't it?

127
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:42,199
All the Sahaja Yogis say with this finger in their ears Allah ho Akbar.

128
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:46,042
Because you know this is the finger that represents thevishuddi

129
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:48,836
and the vishuddi chakras'

130
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:52,953
deity Shri Krishna becomes the Virata with Akbar.

131
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:54,700
So when you say about Akbar

132
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:57,511
you have to put your fingers into your ears

133
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:59,668
and you have to say Allah ho Akbar.

134
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:04,543
Whole relationship and everything

135
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:06,981
was never understood.

136
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:10,722
For Indians Shri Krishna was their Omkara.

137
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:15,974
For western people Christ was their Omkara.

138
00:17:16,228 --> 00:17:22,347
For other people of Arabistan Mohammed was their Omkara. How can that be?

139
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:24,751
They are all related to each other.

140
00:17:25,722 --> 00:17:30,027
So how to related to each other is a problem of Sahaja Yoga.

141
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:37,903
When they come from different communities and different fixed ideas

142
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:42,018
it's impossible to stir them and tell them that, "You are all one."

143
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:48,241
We talk of Hindu Muslim unity for example. Mohammed Sahib

144
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:51,590
didn't know there were problems like that

145
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:55,414
but Nanaka did say we have come to do Hindu Muslim unity.

146
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:59,974
But in the outside if you do the Hindu Muslim unity or any unity,

147
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:04,805
it doesn't work out. It doesn't work out in the outside relationship.

148
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:07,238
Even your brother may not be your own brother,

149
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:10,216
if it is working outside.

150
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:15,463
But if the spirit is awakened within you,

151
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:19,875
then spirit is the one which is the connection with the whole

152
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:20,668
with the Virata.

153
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:25,445
With the Akbar.

154
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:31,684
When Akbar is to be felt

155
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,551
you have to have your realization otherwise

156
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:37,225
you are just talking in the air.

157
00:18:38,037 --> 00:18:39,958
You don't know who is this Akbar.

158
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:44,114
You have to get connected to that Virata

159
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:47,806
and that Virata is the Primordial Being.

160
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:52,043
We are

161
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:56,113
actually not integrated at all because we have different incarnations.

162
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:58,904
Even if you are not absolutely atheist,

163
00:18:59,026 --> 00:19:03,719
even if you don't say that you do not believe in God or believe

164
00:19:03,757 --> 00:19:06,564
in something else which is anti-God.

165
00:19:07,428 --> 00:19:10,653
Even if you believe in God, you believe in God

166
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:14,215
in fragmentations, in His different aspects,

167
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:16,965
but you don't see Him in collectivity.

168
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:23,221
You have to see that He is one God. Everybody says He is one God.

169
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,109
Of course He is one God.

170
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:29,617
I am one person but I am also a housewife,

171
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:32,633
I have to do some work for My household.

172
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:35,124
I am also a sister of somebody.

173
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:37,019
I am also your Mother

174
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,673
and Mother of My own children and also a grandmother.

175
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:44,462
So I have so many various aspects of My work

176
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:46,712
which I do. One person has to do it.

177
00:19:47,446 --> 00:19:50,767
When we talk of God as One we think He is Rock of Gibraltar;

178
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:53,771
just one piece. Even Rock of Gibraltar if you go and see

179
00:19:53,974 --> 00:19:54,998
it is not one piece.

180
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:01,963
Anything in this world you cannot say is one piece.

181
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:10,334
It has to be a compound or a mixture of something.

182
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:15,551
Then how can God be just one piece hanging in the air like one,

183
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,148
God is One, so we'll not have any other aspect of God.

184
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:22,950
God has many aspects, which one has to understand.

185
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,723
So there are two concepts

186
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:28,108
which work out in this world I feel.

187
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:32,141
One is that they believe that there is only one God

188
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:37,889
and there cannot be many aspects of God. Which is wrong.

189
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:42,779
Christ has said: 'those who are not against Me are with Me.'

190
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,895
So this kind of a mental conception about God,

191
00:20:46,985 --> 00:20:48,852
that He is just like Rock of Gibraltar.

192
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:52,048
See now this pendal you have done it - there are so many lights,

193
00:20:52,591 --> 00:20:54,913
they are all giving one light to all of us.

194
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:56,531
They are not giving separate lights, are they?

195
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:03,726
How are they fighting with each other?

196
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:08,216
What is the fight going on? They are adding to the same light.

197
00:21:09,277 --> 00:21:12,672
This is one pendal but we have so many lights.

198
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:14,573
We cannot do with one light.

199
00:21:14,827 --> 00:21:18,513
At different periods a person has to be born.

200
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,760
Every period a person had to be born to

201
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:28,726
enlighten one aspect of human awareness and consciousness.

202
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:35,646
Variety has to be there

203
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:38,461
because human beings are varied.

204
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:43,354
And the variety is that supposing you are supporting

205
00:21:43,426 --> 00:21:47,051
somebody's right sidedness

206
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:50,881
then there should be somebody who will come and support the left sidedness.

207
00:21:52,342 --> 00:21:54,679
And it is all done so well within us but

208
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:57,222
it is only human beings in their obstinacy

209
00:21:57,227 --> 00:21:59,227
and in their ignorance cannot see it.

210
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:05,461
We all are made the same way if you see in the whole world.

211
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:08,957
Of course there is variety in appearances.

212
00:22:08,966 --> 00:22:10,966
Maybe an Indian looks like an Indian

213
00:22:11,172 --> 00:22:15,680
and - but in India only you can see Indians have so many different faces.

214
00:22:17,096 --> 00:22:19,430
You can find all colors and all kinds of

215
00:22:19,652 --> 00:22:21,138
things on their faces.

216
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:24,602
In India is the only place where you find all kinds of people.

217
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:29,115
You can have people like Russians,

218
00:22:29,154 --> 00:22:32,234
you can have people like Japanese, Chinese,

219
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,827
you can have people like Africans. All kinds of people are

220
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:37,817
in this country to show that

221
00:22:37,894 --> 00:22:40,644
all people can be called as one race as Indians.

222
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,983
Now it is not always ignorance

223
00:22:50,227 --> 00:22:53,168
that makes people forget that we are all one.

224
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:55,907
Every human being laughs the same way.

225
00:22:56,705 --> 00:22:58,174
Does he laugh in a different way?

226
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:06,245
If he has to eat the food he masticates the same way.

227
00:23:07,418 --> 00:23:11,728
He cries the same way. When he cries his crying is the same.

228
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:14,492
His actions are the same way.

229
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:19,546
If a woman is angry with her husband...yesterday I saw [name] program

230
00:23:20,474 --> 00:23:21,806
with My brother

231
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:25,943
and I was amazed how universal we are in our expressions.

232
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:28,735
He was showing how a woman gets

233
00:23:28,801 --> 00:23:30,801
angry with the husband and how she behaves.

234
00:23:31,462 --> 00:23:34,870
If you see those actions which are depicted you'll be amazed

235
00:23:35,325 --> 00:23:38,752
that they are done by all the women all over the world.

236
00:23:39,764 --> 00:23:43,942
And the reaction of man if you want to see all the men

237
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:45,764
act in the same way.

238
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:51,121
My husband was secretary to Shastriji, you know

239
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,604
that and he went with Lal Bahadur Shastri

240
00:23:55,156 --> 00:23:58,549
to Tashkent at his last time,

241
00:23:58,658 --> 00:24:02,775
but also he went once to Yugoslavia and there

242
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:10,577
[aside: who was General Tito was where? Yugoslav]

243
00:24:11,114 --> 00:24:13,279
And General Tito's wife, you see,

244
00:24:13,543 --> 00:24:15,411
got very friendly with Mrs. Shastri.

245
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:16,636
Both were very friendly.

246
00:24:17,196 --> 00:24:20,714
So Shastriji warned his wife: 'See now! You are great friends

247
00:24:21,075 --> 00:24:24,585
and now don't start crying like an Indian woman when you leave.'

248
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:28,226
So poor thing was controlling her tears all the time.

249
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:32,791
But she told Me: 'I was controlling but it is she who started crying

250
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,084
and such a lot.

251
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:37,931
And then she started crying loudly, hugging me.

252
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:39,875
So I just could not control myself.

253
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,680
I also gave in. I also started crying.

254
00:24:42,954 --> 00:24:46,188
And both the husbands started looking at the ground.'

255
00:24:51,747 --> 00:24:54,271
So basically all the women,

256
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:58,279
all the men in the whole world react the same way to a situation.

257
00:24:59,134 --> 00:25:02,192
And you can see their reactions

258
00:25:02,547 --> 00:25:04,547
very clearly when it comes to children.

259
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,494
They all act in the same way, act in the same manner.

260
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,748
Supposing they hear that two children are caught up

261
00:25:14,173 --> 00:25:17,105
in the air somewhere or something is happening to them.

262
00:25:17,443 --> 00:25:19,443
The whole world will be worried about

263
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,600
how they are going to be saved.

264
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:25,012
Something must be done to save them.

265
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:27,088
The whole world will be praying to God: 'Oh God

266
00:25:27,102 --> 00:25:29,623
please save these two children are caught up there somehow or other.'

267
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,218
Everybody will be worried as if their own child is there.

268
00:25:33,016 --> 00:25:35,426
Even when it comes to death I have seen that.

269
00:25:35,764 --> 00:25:39,242
When there was a air space -

270
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:42,257
the space craft was going to land

271
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:45,076
and people were worried that they may be lost,

272
00:25:45,522 --> 00:25:48,272
I know in every masjid, in every temple,

273
00:25:48,328 --> 00:25:50,452
in every church and everywhere.

274
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:52,973
They were Americans; nobody thought of Americans,

275
00:25:53,022 --> 00:25:54,054
what religion, anything.

276
00:25:54,128 --> 00:25:56,721
To them it was a part of human beings, you see.

277
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:59,589
The human bondage started acting.

278
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:02,383
That time they never thought what country they were,

279
00:26:02,746 --> 00:26:05,659
what Americans have done to Indians, nothing of the kind.

280
00:26:06,253 --> 00:26:09,407
They just thought: 'Oh God! These people are, oh God please save them.'

281
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,781
Everybody prayed to them -

282
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:15,139
prayed to God and prayed for them that they should be saved.

283
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:18,577
That time what had happened to us? How did we forget?

284
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,786
We touched to the reality at that time

285
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:25,983
and that is what it is.

286
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,634
Anybody who tries.

287
00:26:30,152 --> 00:26:34,680
These Jews when they were troubled by Hitler,

288
00:26:34,942 --> 00:26:36,988
everybody's sympathies were with them.

289
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:40,178
But when these Jews started troubling

290
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,488
the Muslims there everybody's sympathies were with Muslims.

291
00:26:43,664 --> 00:26:45,241
Then why don't you think all religions?

292
00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:47,378
Even the Jews had sympathies with Muslims.

293
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:52,104
Then we don't think what differences we have with them.

294
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:55,138
None of them none of the people I heard said: 'all right

295
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,616
they are punished.' Or, 'It's all right.' Not even Jews.

296
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:03,446
So the part that is within us which is human

297
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,254
becomes absolutely troubled

298
00:27:08,466 --> 00:27:11,362
when we see some other human being is tortured.

299
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:17,235
Of course by with these horrible ideas of fanaticism

300
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,484
or maybe fear or maybe aggressiveness or whatever it is,

301
00:27:22,027 --> 00:27:24,027
we may try to be cruel.

302
00:27:26,471 --> 00:27:28,743
If you ask the people of Germany

303
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:31,183
how do they feel about the massacre,

304
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:33,318
they just put down their heads.

305
00:27:33,357 --> 00:27:35,970
They said: 'we don't know. We were not ourselves.

306
00:27:36,098 --> 00:27:38,358
How we did it we don't know. How it happened

307
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,624
we just don't know how it worked out.'

308
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:46,455
So when the violence is over you just start feeling: 'Oh God,

309
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:53,025
I am a human being, they were human beings.' So this oneness comes in,

310
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:58,250
the feeling the awareness comes in. It is not so in the animals so much.

311
00:27:59,082 --> 00:28:03,514
If they have to work, if they are to be active, they will be together

312
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,078
but if something dies they are not bothered.

313
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:13,666
Even if a child say of a monkey is sick

314
00:28:13,963 --> 00:28:16,200
the mother will be worried. She'll be screaming,

315
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,432
shouting, but if the thing is dead she will just

316
00:28:19,517 --> 00:28:21,517
throw away the child on one side and get up.

317
00:28:23,212 --> 00:28:26,838
It's only the human beings who can feel that oneness.

318
00:28:27,463 --> 00:28:31,924
So our awareness... this was given to us by Shri Krishna's advent.

319
00:28:32,025 --> 00:28:34,025
He gave us this awareness

320
00:28:35,607 --> 00:28:39,262
of human, or He keeps that awareness within us.

321
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:42,413
We have to accept Him as a person

322
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:46,575
who gives us this awareness of human relationship.

323
00:28:50,538 --> 00:28:53,471
And whenever there has been problem

324
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:58,185
like somebody told Me that in Somnat people believe

325
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,127
that Shri Krishna came as

326
00:29:02,266 --> 00:29:04,266
to give lessons. So many Hindus believe

327
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:07,694
it was Shri Krishna who came as Mohammed Kuzni

328
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:10,001
to give a lesson to these horrible Brahmins

329
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:14,674
who were making money out of that temple. So many Hindus believe that;

330
00:29:18,695 --> 00:29:22,550
that to punish these horrible Brahmins who were making money

331
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:27,086
He had to come as Mohammed Kuzni to break that idol

332
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,302
which was giving them so much money and they were making

333
00:29:30,516 --> 00:29:32,728
all kinds of,

334
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:37,751
you can say extractions,

335
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:41,746
from the poor devotees who were devoted to that temple.

336
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,610
It was only He could do it.

337
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:55,732
So we have to understand that when we are not integrated

338
00:29:56,986 --> 00:30:00,605
we cannot feel the integration of our being.

339
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:04,243
We are not integrated, that we have to realize.

340
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:07,857
Our mind works in one way,

341
00:30:09,145 --> 00:30:13,512
our heart works in another way, our liver works in another way.

342
00:30:14,998 --> 00:30:16,911
As I told you I am quite surprised

343
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,341
that when they have told that: 'don't drink',

344
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:22,696
those people who follow these religions still go on drinking.

345
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:25,854
But apart from that religion forget it.

346
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:27,893
They see a man going into a pub

347
00:30:27,984 --> 00:30:31,223
and falling and faltering coming out,

348
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,393
still they enter into the same to get to the same situation. Why?

349
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:37,223
Because the mind tells them not to do it.

350
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:40,201
Mind says: 'don't go.' The brain says: 'don't go.'

351
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:45,717
But their heart is weak. They cannot. The habits.

352
00:30:46,681 --> 00:30:49,605
All the habits come through this kind of disintegration.

353
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,949
We are so disintegrated within ourselves,

354
00:30:53,296 --> 00:30:57,331
that if a person wants to do something

355
00:30:57,784 --> 00:30:59,438
he just does the opposite of it

356
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:01,683
and that is the reason

357
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:05,492
why we accept these kind of juxtapositions in life,

358
00:31:05,826 --> 00:31:08,892
what was told by Him about music and about everything.

359
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,112
Music has come out of God's love to us.

360
00:31:18,046 --> 00:31:21,597
Anything that is not for God's love is not music.

361
00:31:22,456 --> 00:31:24,454
I will give you an example. There was a lady

362
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:27,952
who used to do some sort of a kawali

363
00:31:29,224 --> 00:31:31,661
and I was on the censor board. I censored her

364
00:31:33,043 --> 00:31:36,525
kawalis and I said: 'this is not a kawali.'

365
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:39,768
She said: 'why?' I said: 'this is called as mujarat.

366
00:31:40,594 --> 00:31:43,533
This is horribly sensuous and horrible thing.

367
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,745
It's an insult of God. You can't sing like that.'

368
00:31:46,563 --> 00:31:49,492
So she said: 'no, this is kawali.' I said:

369
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,154
'do you know kawali was never sung by women

370
00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:55,928
and was never done in this dirty fashion the way

371
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:58,501
like a prostitute you are singing this kawali?'

372
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:02,873
It's always all the music was in the praise of God.

373
00:32:02,932 --> 00:32:04,472
And that's why Mohammed Sahib said

374
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:07,836
that all the music should be in the praise of God

375
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:11,282
and should not be. So we had other things like nath and all that.

376
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:16,500
But you find even at the time of Shri Krishna all the music

377
00:32:16,753 --> 00:32:20,423
was to be just done for ras.

378
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,007
Ra. Ra is 'energy'. Sa means 'same'.

379
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,919
With Radha they were playing together,

380
00:32:26,202 --> 00:32:28,975
playing Rasa and that's how they were doing

381
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,592
the circulation of the energy to integrate themselves

382
00:32:34,817 --> 00:32:40,640
and singing the music. It is for that. But you find that

383
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:43,730
people don't understand.

384
00:32:43,855 --> 00:32:45,855
They use music for sensuousness.

385
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:48,518
Is anti-God. This music force

386
00:32:48,663 --> 00:32:51,616
has come to us to praise God that's all. For nothing else.

387
00:32:52,294 --> 00:32:54,259
For doing all kinds of dirty things and

388
00:32:54,565 --> 00:32:56,825
singing all kinds of funny things. Imagine.

389
00:32:56,856 --> 00:32:58,646
And the reaction is built in so much.

390
00:32:58,905 --> 00:33:00,737
When He said that all the music

391
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:03,647
should be in the name of God, we have a person like

392
00:33:03,704 --> 00:33:05,598
Horam Zebu who would not take to any music.

393
00:33:06,256 --> 00:33:10,160
He was such a staunchy fellow and the other Muslims who came in

394
00:33:10,426 --> 00:33:13,152
would not sing anything that is kawali or anything,

395
00:33:13,396 --> 00:33:15,118
would sing horrible gazals

396
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:19,895
which are just describing the separation

397
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:23,255
of a woman and a man and all kinds of dirty things.

398
00:33:26,112 --> 00:33:31,475
With this disintegrated temperaments people took to anything

399
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:36,167
that came to them just to please themselves. When the advent

400
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:37,913
of this thing like Omarkhyam.

401
00:33:38,043 --> 00:33:40,465
Who is he? He's anti-God absolutely anti-God man.

402
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:41,679
Horrible.

403
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:44,859
But people appreciate him very much, Omarkhyam what a poetry it is.

404
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:51,399
They appreciate - why? Because the disintegrated part of their heart

405
00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:53,342
likes Omarkhyam when he sings:

406
00:33:53,503 --> 00:33:55,236
'Oh we should drink here.

407
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:58,091
What is there in this life? We don't know what is going to be there.'

408
00:33:58,251 --> 00:34:00,782
Because Mohammed Sahib has said not to drink,

409
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:04,362
he must sing such a song. This is the poetry of Mr. Omarkhyam,

410
00:34:04,574 --> 00:34:06,574
who is being very much respected everywhere.

411
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:14,266
And he's very much regarded as a great poet

412
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:23,079
in Iraq where today Khomeini is one great horrible man is born

413
00:34:23,372 --> 00:34:27,927
and he still respects this Omarkhyam; I don't know how can he respect him.

414
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:32,330
What a contrast it is, just see, what a contrast this Omarkhyam

415
00:34:32,547 --> 00:34:33,496
singing dirty songs.

416
00:34:36,163 --> 00:34:37,670
They are not in praise of God.

417
00:34:38,217 --> 00:34:41,959
Music which is not in the praise of God is not music. Is ashleed.

418
00:34:42,984 --> 00:34:49,798
Is filth. Is dirt. Our classical music in India

419
00:34:50,206 --> 00:34:52,749
was based on AUM.

420
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:57,685
Even at Kundalini when it reaches here

421
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:00,291
at the vishuddhi chakra it makes all the sounds:

422
00:35:00,385 --> 00:35:03,679
AM, AAM, EM, EEM, UM, OOM, RIM, REEM, LRIM, LREEM,

423
00:35:04,071 --> 00:35:08,074
AYE, AYEE, AO, AOU, ANG, AH

424
00:35:08,326 --> 00:35:12,810
All these sixteen vowels are coming from the sixteen chakras

425
00:35:14,761 --> 00:35:18,689
or the sub-chakras or the petals of this vishuddhi chakra.

426
00:35:19,443 --> 00:35:23,212
These are Bija mantras of the vishuddhi chakra.

427
00:35:23,278 --> 00:35:25,278
All the vowels come from here

428
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:33,847
and when we sing dirty songs we spoil this chakra vishuddhi.

429
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:36,306
That's why all the people

430
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:39,925
who sing these dirty songs have to take to drinking,

431
00:35:40,073 --> 00:35:42,146
because I think they can't bear,

432
00:35:43,427 --> 00:35:45,427
or they can't do it,

433
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:48,445
they can't sing these bad songs

434
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,305
unless and until they take to some sort of an escape from God.

435
00:35:54,471 --> 00:35:57,931
So music and drinking started going hand in hand.

436
00:36:00,336 --> 00:36:03,485
In the West the music broke all its traditions

437
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:10,727
because they had no sense left in them

438
00:36:11,346 --> 00:36:14,088
to recognize that music is meant only for God.

439
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:18,904
Only for hymns to be sung in the praise of God. All music

440
00:36:18,995 --> 00:36:20,244
should be in the praise of God.

441
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:23,588
All ragas should be in the praise of God.

442
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:27,099
We had no Namas system of different times,

443
00:36:27,242 --> 00:36:29,874
but we have a system of music in different times.

444
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:33,252
At different time a certain music should be played

445
00:36:33,563 --> 00:36:35,191
where you describe a mood.

446
00:36:35,433 --> 00:36:37,433
And all the moods that are described

447
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:39,689
have to relate themselves to God.

448
00:36:42,235 --> 00:36:46,325
There is no other mood that is enjoyable to the spirit

449
00:36:47,611 --> 00:36:53,721
that does not relate to God. There's no mood

450
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:59,815
which one can enjoy. Even Bhivatsa the mood of Bhivatsa is grotesque.

451
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:02,448
Even that mood one enjoyed,

452
00:37:02,728 --> 00:37:09,125
one can listen to when they see the filth and dirt. The left side.

453
00:37:10,788 --> 00:37:14,486
Is so scientific. Our music system is extremely scientific,

454
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:21,331
because it was taken in the form of this music

455
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:25,489
with actually the Kundalini moving into different these Sapta Swaras.

456
00:37:25,736 --> 00:37:30,735
These seven Swaras are built in our seven chakras:

457
00:37:32,772 --> 00:37:34,772
It start with Sa,

458
00:37:36,107 --> 00:37:41,848
then, Re, Ga, Ma - Mother, Pa,

459
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:44,566
Dha, Ni.

460
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:46,575
My name also starts with Ni.

461
00:37:49,075 --> 00:37:51,075
These seven Swaras

462
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:57,171
are built in with seven notes and there are vrikrutis.

463
00:37:57,723 --> 00:38:00,761
Vrikrut Swaras which are the side other

464
00:38:01,411 --> 00:38:06,357
what-you-call chakras that we have

465
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:11,392
to make about twelve Swaras.

466
00:38:12,883 --> 00:38:15,550
But nobody understood the real meaning of music.

467
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:21,866
Sharada the Goddess of Saraswati is the one

468
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:25,209
who carries the message of Virata within

469
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:28,911
and tells us how to sing.

470
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,533
She tells us what is appealing to God.

471
00:38:33,817 --> 00:38:36,670
How these ragas were made also just think of it.

472
00:38:37,684 --> 00:38:40,263
Because first they chose the notes

473
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:43,605
the arroha of rohas the going up and down,

474
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:45,580
which was appealing to God.

475
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:48,716
So the melodies were created.

476
00:38:48,913 --> 00:38:50,098
Melodies are fixed.

477
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:54,032
You cannot change the melodies the notes, because

478
00:38:54,195 --> 00:38:57,819
they found out that at this point the spirit awakened.

479
00:38:59,356 --> 00:39:01,102
On the vibrations they found out.

480
00:39:01,185 --> 00:39:05,760
They found out that when they sang this way it did - worked out.

481
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:10,426
The Veena they played and they found out the exact Swaras.

482
00:39:12,901 --> 00:39:18,225
Exact Swaras which would really make you feel nice.

483
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:21,155
Now you know that those people who are from -

484
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,303
have come from the West

485
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:26,555
don't understand any Indian music on the mental level.

486
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:29,721
But they understand at the spiritual level

487
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:34,171
because their spirits get filled with joy

488
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:35,930
and the vibration starts flowing.

489
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,999
The sense of music - this depiction of music was done by Shri Krishna.

490
00:39:43,222 --> 00:39:45,946
It is He the One who taught Tala.

491
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:53,889
Of course we can say that Shiva is the One who dances the Tala,

492
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:57,177
but the One who depicted it for human beings

493
00:39:57,745 --> 00:39:59,736
who gave the message to the world

494
00:40:00,635 --> 00:40:02,635
how the Tala should be, is

495
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:06,231
Shri Krishna through His dancing movements.

496
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:10,412
He kept the Tala all the time,

497
00:40:12,158 --> 00:40:15,638
like the way He stands itself suggests how He kept the Tala.

498
00:40:17,821 --> 00:40:19,463
And He played the mudlhi also

499
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:24,737
to suggest that music is what God's love is.

500
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,799
His music is suggesting of God's love.

501
00:40:28,902 --> 00:40:34,343
That soothes you. That clears you. That makes you happy.

502
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:36,627
That gives you joy.

503
00:40:37,487 --> 00:40:43,082
And that's why He suggested through His singing, through His music.

504
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,918
He never wrote any poetry did He?

505
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:51,951
He never wrote any poetry as such, but when He spoke,

506
00:40:53,058 --> 00:40:57,874
when He spoke in gudria in the prose it became Gita.

507
00:40:59,797 --> 00:41:02,093
Just when He spoke it became Gita.

508
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:05,620
Of course people have tried to spoil

509
00:41:05,843 --> 00:41:09,594
quite a lot of it - the rhythm, which I feel sometimes when

510
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:13,140
people recite it, but still

511
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:16,136
we must say when He really created it, it was

512
00:41:16,492 --> 00:41:23,529
for human beings to create poetry out of prose.

513
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:25,262
Out of prose.

514
00:41:27,965 --> 00:41:30,188
He made it communicable.

515
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:34,175
Because people could first only understand the music,

516
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:37,019
the rhythm of the music. They didn't understand

517
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:40,457
much words and things but He made it possible.

518
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,584
Even in Koran, if you read,

519
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:48,367
the few words before starting every chapter nobody understands.

520
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,548
They are all nothing but mantra bijas;

521
00:41:53,603 --> 00:41:54,620
but they put it there.

522
00:41:54,689 --> 00:41:56,038
They knew people won't understand,

523
00:41:56,052 --> 00:41:58,061
but He put it there because people would understand.

524
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:03,147
All these things you may not understand.

525
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:05,801
You may not understand Me either,

526
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:11,095
possibly, but whatever they did was for your heetha.

527
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:14,804
This is what happened, at the time of Shri Krishna

528
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:18,323
that He established the concept of heeth,

529
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:24,295
because it was said that you must speak the truth

530
00:42:24,701 --> 00:42:28,118
and you must speak the thing that is sweet, Pria.

531
00:42:31,205 --> 00:42:35,652
It was the message of Shri Krishna that you must speak sweetly.

532
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:38,532
Those people who have

533
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:43,777
got a proper vishuddhi chakra speak very sweetly.

534
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:47,053
Their voice has that enchanting method

535
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:49,543
of capturing the hearts of people

536
00:42:49,832 --> 00:42:52,892
and not debasing them, but elevating them.

537
00:42:55,022 --> 00:42:57,297
So He said you must do it sweetly.

538
00:42:57,404 --> 00:42:59,404
That was His main theme.

539
00:42:59,425 --> 00:43:03,053
Everything He did so sweetly that He created a leela

540
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,145
out of His doings. It was a leela that he made.

541
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,221
He said this world is not a place where you should be serious,

542
00:43:10,813 --> 00:43:12,286
you should be sharp,

543
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:16,728
you should be tense, but it's a leela. Just see the leela, the drama.

544
00:43:17,206 --> 00:43:20,206
The whole is a drama. So the whole thing is very sweet.

545
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:24,910
If you see the whole world as a drama it becomes a sweet thing.

546
00:43:25,784 --> 00:43:29,840
The sweetness of it, even if you see a person

547
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:33,426
trying to be funny, you get a joy out of it.

548
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,667
If you know it's a drama

549
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:39,708
you don't get worried if somebody comes and murders somebody

550
00:43:39,739 --> 00:43:41,739
and you know it's all fake, it's a drama.

551
00:43:42,404 --> 00:43:46,419
It's a drama going on and that's what He told people

552
00:43:46,516 --> 00:43:48,304
that the whole thing is a leela

553
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,348
so that people should not get into serious moods and

554
00:43:51,422 --> 00:43:54,358
actually start acting in the drama in the real way.

555
00:43:54,724 --> 00:43:57,757
Like, you see, you appoint somebody as,

556
00:43:59,483 --> 00:44:02,743
say, Shivaji Maharaj

557
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:07,670
and there is somebody coming from the other side and he takes

558
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,252
a sword and he really hits

559
00:44:11,046 --> 00:44:15,054
the fellow there and you say this Shivaji Maharaj actor is no good;

560
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:18,861
he gets absolutely involved into the thing and hits the other person.

561
00:44:21,147 --> 00:44:24,841
So it's a drama and He made it into a leela.

562
00:44:25,631 --> 00:44:29,148
Leela because it's a drama no doubt. But when,

563
00:44:29,442 --> 00:44:32,643
when you get realized you start seeing the drama and the play

564
00:44:32,889 --> 00:44:34,116
and the whole thing is,

565
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:37,716
you must have seen that most of the Sahaja Yogis are always laughing,

566
00:44:38,295 --> 00:44:40,536
because they see the way things are happening.

567
00:44:40,893 --> 00:44:44,797
Even when they see a guru misbehaving or something

568
00:44:44,937 --> 00:44:47,102
they just feel like laughing how absurd it is.

569
00:44:48,051 --> 00:44:50,966
Like somebody came today to talk to Me

570
00:44:51,843 --> 00:44:55,247
and he told Me: 'Mother, I have been to all kinds of nonsensical things.'

571
00:44:55,265 --> 00:44:58,125
And he was just laughing. He said: 'I laugh at them now what I did.'

572
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:01,808
He said: 'I went to one guru who is going to - who used

573
00:45:01,883 --> 00:45:03,456
to give name to people;

574
00:45:03,624 --> 00:45:05,080
say this Nama that Nam.

575
00:45:05,419 --> 00:45:08,625
I made such efforts, I went to people,

576
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:11,662
recommended my case.' Because he was not so rich,

577
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,844
you see, so he was never bought the name

578
00:45:14,065 --> 00:45:15,917
and he was saying: 'give me the name.

579
00:45:15,962 --> 00:45:17,594
I must have the name.' And the guru was

580
00:45:17,612 --> 00:45:19,612
saying; 'No, no, no, no. You have to wait three...'

581
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:22,676
He said: 'I poured so much money in his savapati

582
00:45:22,914 --> 00:45:26,217
and which were large savapatis were put. I did everything,

583
00:45:26,672 --> 00:45:28,406
but he would not give me a name

584
00:45:28,815 --> 00:45:31,127
and ultimately when it

585
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,606
came to that he said: 'all right I'll give you a name',

586
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,741
and he gave me a name

587
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,974
which I started taking. I really became mad after that.

588
00:45:38,993 --> 00:45:41,293
I started getting headaches, this that.

589
00:45:41,745 --> 00:45:43,745
Then he said; 'all right you have to suffer.

590
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,349
If you don't suffer you must go through it.

591
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:48,668
Yes you must. You asked for the name so you have it.'

592
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,517
And when he came to Me,

593
00:45:50,809 --> 00:45:54,119
he was looking like nothing on earth, I tell you.

594
00:45:54,286 --> 00:45:56,213
In a very funny shape he came to Me,

595
00:45:56,793 --> 00:45:58,672
but now he's completely cured.

596
00:45:58,693 --> 00:46:01,312
I could not even recognize him the other day I just saw him.

597
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,771
I said: 'Oh God are you the same person?'

598
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,333
So he said: 'Mother now I laugh at all these things

599
00:46:06,603 --> 00:46:10,269
and I just see that how people are stupid

600
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:14,830
to go to these false people, follow false ideas and

601
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:18,478
false conceptions and how they are missing the point.'

602
00:46:21,294 --> 00:46:22,662
And he asked Me a question:

603
00:46:22,815 --> 00:46:26,417
'have they to go to that limit of destruction to come to You?'

604
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:29,676
I said: 'I don't know about them what they have decided.'

605
00:46:30,292 --> 00:46:33,925
But it is true that people are so stupid

606
00:46:34,572 --> 00:46:39,235
that they take to all these ideas and all these negative things

607
00:46:39,604 --> 00:46:42,385
much more easily than to the positive things,

608
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:46,192
because of the vishuddhi chakra being spoilt.

609
00:46:47,482 --> 00:46:51,612
If your vishuddhi chakra is not spoilt, your hands are working better.

610
00:46:52,617 --> 00:46:54,303
Many people who get realization

611
00:46:55,174 --> 00:46:57,095
do not feel vibrations in the hands,

612
00:46:57,398 --> 00:47:00,738
because their vishuddhi chakras are not all right.

613
00:47:01,197 --> 00:47:04,710
Now what does that mean that your vishuddhi chakra is not all right?

614
00:47:04,943 --> 00:47:08,788
First of all by temperament you are not a collective person -

615
00:47:09,447 --> 00:47:15,761
by temperament. You are not a person who enjoys collectivity much.

616
00:47:15,948 --> 00:47:17,611
Like people who are fussy.

617
00:47:18,341 --> 00:47:20,558
'I want this. I want that.

618
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:24,697
I want to sleep on a proper bed.

619
00:47:24,773 --> 00:47:28,276
I must have this. I must do that.' This kind of an 'I'.

620
00:47:28,543 --> 00:47:30,880
Those who have too much 'I' in them

621
00:47:31,286 --> 00:47:35,226
because both the ego and super-ego start from this vishuddhi chakra.

622
00:47:36,175 --> 00:47:40,810
You see a man who is an egoistical person is

623
00:47:41,308 --> 00:47:44,580
not able to see the collectivity at all because

624
00:47:44,776 --> 00:47:46,425
he is separated with the rest of them.

625
00:47:46,953 --> 00:47:51,915
His Omkara covers his being so much that he cannot enjoy the collectivity.

626
00:47:53,418 --> 00:47:59,281
Now you see Shri Krishna live with whom? With gopis who little, little boys.

627
00:47:59,402 --> 00:48:05,769
He went and used to look after His cows. Just looking after the cows.

628
00:48:07,523 --> 00:48:09,859
None of these incarnations you'll find

629
00:48:10,298 --> 00:48:12,556
were interested in rich people or anything.

630
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:17,283
He went and stayed

631
00:48:17,844 --> 00:48:22,974
with people who were very ordinary from the worldly point of view

632
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:28,804
and there He played and there He did all these tricks of sweetness.

633
00:48:29,749 --> 00:48:36,429
He used to steal the butter. He used to steal the butter,

634
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:41,324
and many people who are criticizing Him

635
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,807
always say: 'Oh He was a thief.

636
00:48:44,028 --> 00:48:47,763
Yes He was a thief. He was the thief of the thieves.' And so on.

637
00:48:48,678 --> 00:48:50,291
He used to steal the butter,

638
00:48:50,582 --> 00:48:54,214
because this butter was taken to Mathura

639
00:48:54,579 --> 00:49:01,281
by these ladies to get some money. And that was giving more help

640
00:49:02,176 --> 00:49:08,558
to all these horrible rakshasas who were in Mathura.

641
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:15,135
So He didn't want this to go there and give them this good health.

642
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,928
The best thing was to steal the butter so they don't get it

643
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:22,156
and they starve on their,

644
00:49:22,322 --> 00:49:26,167
they have their deficiencies of the vitamin A and D you can call it

645
00:49:26,344 --> 00:49:28,887
and that they suffer from bad throat

646
00:49:29,127 --> 00:49:31,127
and they have no strength in their hands

647
00:49:31,207 --> 00:49:33,207
when they pick up their swords.

648
00:49:34,523 --> 00:49:36,158
So this was the way to hit them

649
00:49:36,475 --> 00:49:40,607
so that they could not fight the forces of good.

650
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,731
So in that He proved that a higher goal is to be achieved by giving up

651
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:53,428
smaller, silly, stupid goals. The heetha. heetha is the main thing,

652
00:49:53,887 --> 00:50:00,049
because when He said that: 'You don't speak the truth,

653
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:07,083
otherwise people will be hurt.'

654
00:50:08,693 --> 00:50:09,919
All right, so what should you do?

655
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:13,824
You hurt the people so you don't speak the truth,

656
00:50:14,282 --> 00:50:17,900
or you speak the truth you hurt the people. So both cannot go together.

657
00:50:18,272 --> 00:50:23,743
Like if I tell somebody: 'Oh you are so bad.' That person gets hurt.

658
00:50:24,256 --> 00:50:27,985
Now if I don't tell that person, that person is lost. So what to do?

659
00:50:29,483 --> 00:50:34,719
He found out the solution so He said: ....

660
00:50:37,692 --> 00:50:46,362
He put the word in between as heetha.

661
00:50:48,272 --> 00:50:55,750
The word heetha means 'good to your spirit;

662
00:50:56,523 --> 00:51:05,345
whatever is good for your spirit.' Heetha word means 'good for your spirit'.

663
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:10,209
It has nothing to do with material things. It means for your spirit.

664
00:51:11,049 --> 00:51:12,270
For example,

665
00:51:12,828 --> 00:51:17,267
if I tell somebody that: 'you should not do that', he may feel bad today,

666
00:51:18,552 --> 00:51:22,657
but if he recognizes that: 'Mother is telling me for my good',

667
00:51:23,064 --> 00:51:26,918
he will do it  and he will gain by that in his heetha.

668
00:51:27,377 --> 00:51:29,743
Or else if he does not do it, later on -

669
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:32,983
supposing I don't tell him and if he

670
00:51:33,197 --> 00:51:35,910
doesn't know about it, or even if I tell him he does not do it -

671
00:51:36,081 --> 00:51:40,153
he is going to feel bad. So it is not priya to his spirit.

672
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,517
It is not priya to him.

673
00:51:42,147 --> 00:51:46,685
So if you do something that is the heetha of a person,

674
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:49,086
sometimes you have to tell a person,

675
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:55,277
sometimes it may look very, very painful.

676
00:51:55,306 --> 00:51:56,737
The other day I told somebody that:

677
00:51:56,787 --> 00:52:00,793
'you don't cure anybody because you're not strong enough to cure.'

678
00:52:01,198 --> 00:52:02,480
He felt very hurt.

679
00:52:05,749 --> 00:52:08,589
So then I'll say: 'all right go ahead. You better cure others,

680
00:52:08,775 --> 00:52:09,911
but don't come back to Me.'

681
00:52:11,615 --> 00:52:13,625
Then he'll land up in a lunatic asylum.

682
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:18,324
But when he'll land up in the lunatic asylum

683
00:52:20,229 --> 00:52:24,062
then what will he say? Was that for his heetha that I said?

684
00:52:24,845 --> 00:52:28,842
Will he be then angry? So ultimately if you say the heetha.

685
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:33,473
Say. Saying is the point. Not doing. Saying.

686
00:52:34,024 --> 00:52:37,450
You say the heetha with your vishuddhi chakra,

687
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:41,948
then ultimately it becomes priya. Means it is light.

688
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,779
So you say a thing which is good for the spirit.

689
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:49,715
Otherwise you just don't say.

690
00:52:51,145 --> 00:52:54,399
But people just say to others to correct them,

691
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:58,693
because they are aggressive. It should be done in love.

692
00:52:59,662 --> 00:53:02,525
Heetha means "done something in love".

693
00:53:03,038 --> 00:53:05,827
If you want to say something to someone in love

694
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,625
and you feel it is necessary

695
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:10,627
and the third condition you must have adikar.

696
00:53:11,082 --> 00:53:13,423
You must have the right to say it to the person.

697
00:53:13,856 --> 00:53:16,016
If you don't have the right you just keep quiet.

698
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,742
Let God look after. You are not in charge of anyone.

699
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:22,653
But if you have to say to someone in love

700
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,459
and if you have an adikara then you have to say it.

701
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:29,406
If you don't have the adikar you should not say anything to anyone

702
00:53:29,775 --> 00:53:33,476
unless and until it is absolutely priya to that person

703
00:53:34,641 --> 00:53:36,091
involving his heetha.

704
00:53:38,769 --> 00:53:39,925
This is what He put,

705
00:53:40,126 --> 00:53:43,629
that you should not do any anadikar chestha. Means you should not do

706
00:53:43,664 --> 00:53:44,793
something unauthorized.

707
00:53:46,104 --> 00:53:49,158
Like I would say somebody comes to Me and says that:

708
00:53:49,247 --> 00:53:51,247
'where is that person whom I want to murder?'

709
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:55,493
Then what is the truth? Should I tell him: 'all right

710
00:53:55,512 --> 00:53:57,918
this is the truth. You go and kill that person.' According

711
00:53:57,938 --> 00:54:01,111
to the strict government law it may be.

712
00:54:01,848 --> 00:54:05,303
I don't know if it is. I don't understand the government laws at all

713
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:08,677
or the human laws. But it is not.

714
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:10,945
Then what do you have to tell him?

715
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:15,608
You just keep quiet. He has no Adikar. He has no right to ask you

716
00:54:15,728 --> 00:54:19,500
or to get this information from you. You just keep quiet. I do.

717
00:54:20,485 --> 00:54:23,025
Then he may beat you - do anything. You just say: 'I don't know.'

718
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:27,478
It is andikar cheestha.

719
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:39,571
It is done many a times. People who are, say,

720
00:54:42,025 --> 00:54:48,001
great nationalists who fight for their country and

721
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:50,847
people want to extract information from them.

722
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:54,603
They suffer. Suffer. But they will not give the information.

723
00:54:55,476 --> 00:54:58,178
Not out of fear, but out of love

724
00:54:58,636 --> 00:55:02,540
of their fellow men who are fighting for the freedom of their country.

725
00:55:02,612 --> 00:55:04,792
This has been done in our country many a times.

726
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:08,227
So you don't speak something

727
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:11,354
which is not the adikara of another. He has no right

728
00:55:11,448 --> 00:55:12,366
to ask this question.

729
00:55:15,676 --> 00:55:18,181
Like that one has to be very discreet

730
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:21,807
and that is what Shri Krishna has given us - His discretion.

731
00:55:23,964 --> 00:55:26,216
 Many people ask Me: 'Mother then in this situation

732
00:55:26,272 --> 00:55:27,163
what should I do?

733
00:55:27,278 --> 00:55:29,122
In that situation what should I do?'

734
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,843
That means the person has not developed a vishuddhi chakra

735
00:55:31,936 --> 00:55:32,755
to be discreet.

736
00:55:33,324 --> 00:55:35,015
He has not evolved. He is not mature enough.

737
00:55:35,034 --> 00:55:36,427
He is still asking Me questions.

738
00:55:37,597 --> 00:55:38,782
In the nirvikalpa state

739
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:41,395
you don't ask Me any questions. You know exactly what is to be done.

740
00:55:41,804 --> 00:55:44,622
When to shout at somebody. When to be quiet.

741
00:55:44,846 --> 00:55:48,966
When to be silent. When to say something and how far to go.

742
00:55:51,144 --> 00:55:54,381
All these qualities develop through proper vishuddhi chakra,

743
00:55:55,142 --> 00:55:57,742
because you are doing it for the heetha of another person.

744
00:55:58,027 --> 00:56:00,166
Sometimes it pays much more to keep quiet.

745
00:56:03,081 --> 00:56:04,854
This is what He has taught us.

746
00:56:05,094 --> 00:56:06,153
Not only taught us

747
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,180
but He has put it within us the discretion part in our vishuddhi chakra.

748
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:18,716
He has put within us the power to witness the drama. To be detached.

749
00:56:19,407 --> 00:56:22,327
He was Yogeshwara. He was Yogeshwara.

750
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:24,117
He was the Ishwara of yoga.

751
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,935
He was the One who was the giver of yoga.

752
00:56:27,198 --> 00:56:30,148
Naturally, because Shiva is the One to be achieved.

753
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:34,217
But the One who helps us is Him. Is Akbar.

754
00:56:37,177 --> 00:56:43,569
Is the Mahalakshmi tattwa, is the central path which takes you to Shiva.

755
00:56:43,926 --> 00:56:45,926
So He is the One who takes us there.

756
00:56:47,135 --> 00:56:49,421
It is He who is supported by all the prophets.

757
00:56:51,444 --> 00:56:55,540
He works out this for you. This great work of evolution.

758
00:56:57,172 --> 00:56:59,255
So one can understand very clearly

759
00:56:59,954 --> 00:57:04,543
that if our vishuddhi chakra is put right, we develop exactly

760
00:57:04,962 --> 00:57:07,039
how to be discreet in Sahaja Yoga.

761
00:57:09,116 --> 00:57:11,917
We devise a method by which we talk so much

762
00:57:13,047 --> 00:57:19,013
that makes people feel priya that they appreciate, they like it, priya.

763
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:22,613
It's loving and also it does their heetha.

764
00:57:23,169 --> 00:57:26,155
Even sometimes you have to say something which is harsh

765
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,953
or maybe your silence may make them feel a little harsh. Doesn't matter.

766
00:57:31,443 --> 00:57:33,837
It will give them ultimately their heetha.

767
00:57:33,975 --> 00:57:37,099
So the ultimate goal is heetha. That's what Krishna had

768
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:39,332
in His mind to do the heetha.

769
00:57:41,341 --> 00:57:44,774
So His Samhara Shakti also which He had, the killing.

770
00:57:45,821 --> 00:57:48,921
Many people criticize Him for that.

771
00:57:49,046 --> 00:57:50,976
Like the Jains you see. At the time

772
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:53,478
of Shri Krishna He had a cousin called Neminath

773
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:56,717
and Neminath was not Shri Krishna.

774
00:57:57,007 --> 00:58:01,374
He was just an ordinary human being who had achieved certain

775
00:58:01,503 --> 00:58:02,830
heights in evolution.

776
00:58:03,288 --> 00:58:06,459
He just got filled up with a kind of a feeling

777
00:58:06,652 --> 00:58:10,519
of a repulsion about killing animals.

778
00:58:11,138 --> 00:58:13,388
Of course killing animals is not a very good thing,

779
00:58:13,775 --> 00:58:17,191
but he was not killing and it was to be done for his marriage.

780
00:58:18,187 --> 00:58:21,480
So he developed such a strong feeling about it that he started

781
00:58:21,788 --> 00:58:27,347
a different thing from real Jainism. Some sort of another path,

782
00:58:27,565 --> 00:58:32,040
in which he said that there should be no killing of animals.

783
00:58:32,276 --> 00:58:35,437
It so became so ridiculously funny, that

784
00:58:35,509 --> 00:58:39,619
it reached a stage where bugs became more important than human beings,

785
00:58:39,844 --> 00:58:42,352
even mosquitoes were more important.

786
00:58:42,705 --> 00:58:46,665
You see those people walking with this thing covered on their faces

787
00:58:46,748 --> 00:58:50,207
and on the street. Everything taken to the last nonsense.

788
00:58:53,929 --> 00:58:56,898
So Shri Krishna gives you discretion

789
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:59,888
and this was very, very, very, very, very important

790
00:59:01,624 --> 00:59:03,278
because all our problems

791
00:59:03,499 --> 00:59:06,477
of disintegration disappears when we have discretion.

792
00:59:07,796 --> 00:59:10,798
But mostly people don't have their vishuddhi all right.

793
00:59:11,694 --> 00:59:15,813
On the one side there's a right vishuddhi which gives us aggressiveness.

794
00:59:15,921 --> 00:59:18,146
With our talk we aggress others.

795
00:59:19,652 --> 00:59:22,297
Most of the politicians have that kind of a capacity.

796
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:26,594
But if they get mediums into them like supra-conscious,

797
00:59:27,026 --> 00:59:31,436
like Hitler had. He learnt it from some Tibetan lamas

798
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:35,038
who taught them these all dirty tricks of overpowering people.

799
00:59:35,169 --> 00:59:37,580
He managed to put such spirits into them,

800
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,476
that they killed thousands and

801
00:59:39,604 --> 00:59:42,503
thousands and thousands and thousands of human beings.

802
00:59:46,085 --> 00:59:48,045
The left vishuddhi is another problem.

803
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:50,338
Such people also don't have

804
00:59:50,672 --> 00:59:53,125
a collectivity sense because they are frightened of others.

805
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:57,558
They are so negative they always see the negative side of another person.

806
00:59:58,781 --> 01:00:00,642
I have seen people who come and tell Me

807
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:02,312
about every Sahaja Yogi:

808
01:00:02,351 --> 01:00:05,480
'that's wrong with that Sahaja Yogi. This is wrong with that Sahaja Yogi.

809
01:00:05,533 --> 01:00:07,685
That's wrong with...' No positive points at all.

810
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:09,218
They only see the negative point.

811
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,850
So they have no collectivity. They are always have fear.

812
01:00:14,058 --> 01:00:15,627
All the time they are frightened

813
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,337
of others because there's something in them that frightens them.

814
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,066
So they have their left vishuddhi

815
01:00:23,257 --> 01:00:25,257
very badly caught up because they are guilty.

816
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:27,562
Specially in the West, you will be surprised,

817
01:00:27,597 --> 01:00:29,680
who are supposed to be such aggressive people.

818
01:00:31,063 --> 01:00:35,041
They have terrible left vishuddhi, because they,

819
01:00:35,767 --> 01:00:39,457
by their doing, build up a very big guilt within themselves.

820
01:00:40,192 --> 01:00:42,769
They see how they have been behaving.

821
01:00:42,784 --> 01:00:44,978
Their community has been behaving.

822
01:00:44,998 --> 01:00:48,547
Their country has been behaving. They develop a big guilt in their mind.

823
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:53,773
Moreover, as Brian has told you, that it is cut -

824
01:00:55,371 --> 01:01:01,399
the roots are cut and you start behaving in an anti-God manner

825
01:01:01,499 --> 01:01:03,997
even without realizing that it's absolutely wrong.

826
01:01:04,823 --> 01:01:09,872
It's true. The left vishuddhi comes up because they feel guilty,

827
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,535
despite their doing wrong things

828
01:01:14,902 --> 01:01:17,477
with the knowledge that they are doing the right thing.

829
01:01:17,705 --> 01:01:20,011
They feel guilty because in the sub-conscious

830
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,676
the conscience of a person works it out

831
01:01:24,725 --> 01:01:28,463
and that guilt is accumulating howsoever you may deny it,

832
01:01:28,877 --> 01:01:31,104
but the left side goes on catching

833
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:33,686
and they have a left vishuddhi. So one has to say that:

834
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:34,780
'Mother, I am not guilty.'

835
01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:37,774
Is another side of ego

836
01:01:37,947 --> 01:01:41,473
where the ego's reaction hides itself into left vishuddhi.

837
01:01:45,091 --> 01:01:46,732
And with that they start feeling guilty:

838
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:49,268
'I should not have done that. I should not have done that.'

839
01:01:49,447 --> 01:01:51,014
Both attitudes are wrong.

840
01:01:51,984 --> 01:01:55,003
When you are on the left side you aggress yourself

841
01:01:55,284 --> 01:01:59,680
and torture yourself and when you are on the right side you torture others

842
01:02:00,123 --> 01:02:01,509
and aggress them.

843
01:02:01,602 --> 01:02:03,995
So to be in the center is only possible

844
01:02:04,144 --> 01:02:05,773
if your vishuddhi chakra is all right.

845
01:02:09,112 --> 01:02:10,809
Otherwise you cannot.

846
01:02:11,879 --> 01:02:13,327
You have seen many people

847
01:02:13,665 --> 01:02:15,000
when they get realization

848
01:02:15,001 --> 01:02:17,512
they don't feel vibrations on both the hands equally.

849
01:02:17,973 --> 01:02:19,973
The reason is they have no balance.

850
01:02:20,576 --> 01:02:23,023
It shows on the hands. They have no balance.

851
01:02:23,069 --> 01:02:26,229
Now hands are very important part of human beings after Sahaja Yoga.

852
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:29,497
If your hands do not have equals,

853
01:02:29,732 --> 01:02:31,935
equal vibrations, then something wrong with you.

854
01:02:32,286 --> 01:02:34,021
Whatever side you do not have

855
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:39,024
vibrations, say, if you don't have vibrations right side or

856
01:02:39,414 --> 01:02:43,371
you feel that right side is heavy, or

857
01:02:43,398 --> 01:02:47,613
is hot, then definitely you are right sided person.

858
01:02:48,274 --> 01:02:51,901
In such cases maybe left side is absolutely numb.

859
01:02:52,084 --> 01:02:55,461
Those people have numb left side means also they are right sided.

860
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:02,811
But in the left hand if you have more vibrations and on the right hand

861
01:03:02,943 --> 01:03:03,953
you don't have any,

862
01:03:04,277 --> 01:03:07,447
then also it means that you are right sided,

863
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:14,200
not that you are left sided. But on the other side

864
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:17,444
if you have the other way round then you are a left sided person.

865
01:03:17,698 --> 01:03:19,902
That means the balance is not there. Your hand says

866
01:03:20,095 --> 01:03:21,318
that there should be balance.

867
01:03:23,319 --> 01:03:26,229
So you must know that only by thinking

868
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:29,520
you are not going to get rid of your troubles in Sahaja Yoga you

869
01:03:29,546 --> 01:03:31,177
have to work with your hands. As I told you

870
01:03:31,304 --> 01:03:33,530
that just by thinking you can't drive your car,

871
01:03:33,562 --> 01:03:34,617
you have to use your hands.

872
01:03:34,661 --> 01:03:36,661
You have to use your hands with full knowledge

873
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,046
as to where you are,

874
01:03:38,096 --> 01:03:40,341
what you are and what would these vibrations mean.

875
01:03:40,398 --> 01:03:43,730
You have to use your hands. Now when you start using your hands

876
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:45,522
for all practical purposes

877
01:03:45,646 --> 01:03:48,210
other people might start thinking: 'these people have gone mad.

878
01:03:48,244 --> 01:03:49,333
They are using their hands.'

879
01:03:49,773 --> 01:03:51,738
But the same way they thought when Mohammed Sahib

880
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,040
taught them to use their hands.

881
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:56,791
They all laughed at Him but now

882
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:00,048
nobody is ashamed of it, nobody laughs at it

883
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:03,270
but they are doing all mechanically - not the way He has said.

884
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:11,857
So first of all use these hands for your own purpose.

885
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,274
For yourself. These same hands can help you.

886
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:16,600
Now the Kundalini has awakened;

887
01:04:16,814 --> 01:04:21,014
so it is passing through all the centers in a very thin way maybe,

888
01:04:21,114 --> 01:04:21,912
but it is there.

889
01:04:22,102 --> 01:04:24,544
So first raise it more and more. You can do it with your hands.

890
01:04:26,259 --> 01:04:28,487
It's, it's a circle

891
01:04:28,839 --> 01:04:31,548
when your hands raise it it starts flowing more in your hands.

892
01:04:31,888 --> 01:04:34,694
Only your hands can raise it. It starts flowing in your hands.

893
01:04:35,165 --> 01:04:37,431
Giving yourself a Bandhan or raise yourself -

894
01:04:37,518 --> 01:04:40,848
raise your Kundalini. Learn all these methods carefully.

895
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:42,600
Your hands are very important.

896
01:04:43,204 --> 01:04:45,964
If your hands are not working, you be careful on that.

897
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,653
You have to get your vibrations in your hands to begin with.

898
01:04:54,227 --> 01:04:56,433
Some people who have had problems with their hands,

899
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,545
because of previous life or some sort of a thing,

900
01:04:59,815 --> 01:05:04,366
they feel their chakras in the - their own places.

901
01:05:07,855 --> 01:05:10,835
Then after some times you'll start feeling your chakras in your brain.

902
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:16,880
Doesn't matter.

903
01:05:17,068 --> 01:05:19,587
You will never feel anything uncomfortable with it.

904
01:05:19,612 --> 01:05:20,842
You will be able to manage.

905
01:05:21,462 --> 01:05:25,695
After that you need not feel the chakras at all. You don't feel anything.

906
01:05:25,764 --> 01:05:30,042
You just say; 'this is it.' Finished. They just know.

907
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:33,622
That also 'knowing'

908
01:05:33,859 --> 01:05:37,394
comes through your vishuddhi and you just say it, again say it.

909
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:43,052
The most important function of the vishuddhi chakra is

910
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:46,151
that it should be pure and clean because

911
01:05:46,204 --> 01:05:49,180
if you have to say mantras your vishuddhi has to be clean.

912
01:05:51,016 --> 01:05:54,510
All the mantras have to have the help of vishuddhis.

913
01:05:54,773 --> 01:05:56,490
When a guru gives a mantra,

914
01:05:56,913 --> 01:06:00,715
first thing you'll find he will have a left vishuddhi catch

915
01:06:01,869 --> 01:06:05,459
and any other chakra whatever the chakra the guru has attacked.

916
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:07,667
But first will be on the left vishuddhi

917
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:11,003
so for that we use the mantra of mantrasiddhi

918
01:06:11,994 --> 01:06:15,490
The mantrasiddhi comes on a person when his left vishuddhi is all right

919
01:06:15,628 --> 01:06:17,294
otherwise he cannot be mantrasiddhi.

920
01:06:17,715 --> 01:06:20,274
Whatever mantras they say is all mechanical.

921
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:25,885
Your left vishuddhi should be all right if you have to say the mantras

922
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,611
in a proper way to be effective to have enlightened mantras.

923
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:33,223
Even Allah ho Akbar has no meaning if your left vishuddhi is not all right.

924
01:06:36,146 --> 01:06:39,765
So you will see how in Sahaja Yoga left vishuddhi is important

925
01:06:39,906 --> 01:06:42,069
and right vishuddhi is important for vibrations.

926
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:51,188
So vishuddhi chakra plays a tremendous part, role in, in Sahaja Yoga

927
01:06:52,878 --> 01:06:56,539
because it connects you to the Virat, to the whole.

928
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:58,146
So you come to the point

929
01:06:58,277 --> 01:07:00,914
where you know that it is trough vishuddhi chakra.

930
01:07:01,022 --> 01:07:03,022
You know the whole Akbar.

931
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,661
You get connected with Him.

932
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:08,520
The rapport is established through vishuddhi chakra

933
01:07:09,278 --> 01:07:11,278
and you can feel it, is communicated.

934
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,496
The rapport may be, supposing the hands are cut,

935
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:17,504
still you might get your Realization. Many get it.

936
01:07:18,131 --> 01:07:20,780
But if you do not have your hands intact,

937
01:07:21,036 --> 01:07:22,672
then the communication is poor.

938
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:26,907
Then maybe on your chakras you will start

939
01:07:27,075 --> 01:07:29,383
developing the communication later on.

940
01:07:29,822 --> 01:07:32,024
But this is the easiest way

941
01:07:32,153 --> 01:07:36,221
to feel the communication in your hands, if your hands are sensitive.

942
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:40,928
So what should we do to keep the vishuddhi chakra is the problem.

943
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:44,689
I have been told that I should finish My lecture soon and go away soon,

944
01:07:44,862 --> 01:07:48,435
but I think I should finish this today about vishuddhi chakra.

945
01:07:49,018 --> 01:07:52,299
What should we do to keep our vishuddhi chakra all right?

946
01:07:52,634 --> 01:07:56,970
Steal the butter and eat it.

947
01:08:00,332 --> 01:08:03,535
You must eat butter because it has vitamin A and D.

948
01:08:03,603 --> 01:08:06,275
Vitamin D especially. I am sorry. Vitamin D.

949
01:08:07,878 --> 01:08:11,604
So that calcium grows in your body. So you'll become a strong person.

950
01:08:12,439 --> 01:08:17,221
If you just take calcium without butter then there's a problem.

951
01:08:19,169 --> 01:08:26,572
So try to take butter whenever you have vishuddhi chakra problem,

952
01:08:26,636 --> 01:08:29,341
for physical side; I'm just telling about this.

953
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:34,601
You can take some butter in water, hot water; spread it on and take it.

954
01:08:35,508 --> 01:08:40,687
Vishuddhi chakra looks after the cooling side.

955
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:45,617
Cooling side. Because the liver when it is heat, gives heat

956
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:47,437
the body becomes heated up.

957
01:08:48,452 --> 01:08:52,301
Then the one that really cools it down is the vishuddhi chakra

958
01:08:53,772 --> 01:08:59,552
and when you have a problem on the, on the drying of the epithelial

959
01:08:59,592 --> 01:09:03,444
cells inside, the lining, then best thing is to take some butter

960
01:09:04,537 --> 01:09:08,192
in the water, or eat some butter during summer time.

961
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:11,744
But no carbohydrates with it. No carbohydrates.

962
01:09:11,993 --> 01:09:15,039
Then you won't put on weight. You eat as much as you like - butter.

963
01:09:15,244 --> 01:09:19,184
You will not put on weight. If you can give up carbohydrates completely

964
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:22,455
you will have Satvikahara absolutely.

965
01:09:22,831 --> 01:09:24,689
You should not touch carbohydrates

966
01:09:26,056 --> 01:09:29,115
and you will be amazed that you will have Satvikahara.

967
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:31,339
Take butter and proteins.

968
01:09:32,441 --> 01:09:36,443
Take all fats, cream, everything. Nothing will go wrong with you.

969
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:40,282
You can take for proteins all dried fruits, everything

970
01:09:40,898 --> 01:09:46,396
and just take this honey for sweet. No carbohydrates.

971
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:50,954
Or also these days honey is made out of sugar as you know.

972
01:09:52,052 --> 01:09:54,179
So if you can avoid carbohydrates

973
01:09:54,675 --> 01:09:57,939
and just take these things your health will be all right.

974
01:09:58,025 --> 01:10:01,467
But we have patients. We have all kinds of imbalances.

975
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,539
That's why I say, "All right, if you have a liver take sugar."

976
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:08,129
But if you just give up sugar it is not going to help.

977
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,821
You have to first correct your liver and then you

978
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:13,096
can give up sugar very easily. No problem.

979
01:10:13,567 --> 01:10:14,662
But not before that.

980
01:10:14,686 --> 01:10:17,348
Like all the doctors in general say: 'don't take sugar.'

981
01:10:18,085 --> 01:10:22,580
The fat goes out of the body just giving the lining of the body,

982
01:10:22,629 --> 01:10:24,649
the softness, and goes out of the body.

983
01:10:25,106 --> 01:10:26,290
It doesn't stay

984
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:29,524
because if there is no carbohydrates it cannot be retained in the body.

985
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:34,156
You can see at home.

986
01:10:34,441 --> 01:10:37,030
You put some butter on your hand. All right?

987
01:10:37,142 --> 01:10:39,756
And wash it. It won't wash. It will just stick there.

988
01:10:39,926 --> 01:10:42,819
It will have no effect - nothing, but it will be just sticking out there.

989
01:10:43,058 --> 01:10:44,213
It cannot be consumed.

990
01:10:44,453 --> 01:10:45,850
But if you put some carbohydrate

991
01:10:45,929 --> 01:10:47,929
say put some arta or something you can take it out.

992
01:10:49,081 --> 01:10:53,077
It dissolves. It cannot be dissolved if you do not take carbohydrates.

993
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:57,181
But this is for people who do not have any imbalances in the body,

994
01:10:57,168 --> 01:10:58,485
who are perfectly all right;

995
01:10:58,737 --> 01:11:01,304
they can do it. I can do it but nobody allows Me.

996
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:06,878
Everybody uses Me for feeding as if I am a wastepaper basket.

997
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:11,827
If I don't eat... you see you are supposed to give Mother

998
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:13,867
something like an aryuvedia this much.

999
01:11:14,326 --> 01:11:16,076
But I have seen people when they want to give Me

1000
01:11:16,095 --> 01:11:17,831
they'll give Me so much

1001
01:11:18,506 --> 01:11:20,520
and if I eat a little they'll feel that:

1002
01:11:20,546 --> 01:11:22,989
'oh what Mother is ....' I don't need it actually.

1003
01:11:23,139 --> 01:11:24,726
People should understand My nature.

1004
01:11:25,589 --> 01:11:29,736
So when they serve Me, they'll serve so much that I cannot eat.

1005
01:11:30,136 --> 01:11:31,933
I just eat little. I can manage.

1006
01:11:32,248 --> 01:11:35,989
There is no need for Me to eat carbohydrates at all, at all.

1007
01:11:36,219 --> 01:11:37,772
I need not have carbohydrates.

1008
01:11:39,505 --> 01:11:41,505
But; 'Mother I have made this.

1009
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,999
Please have it. Mother I have made these laddhus. Please have it. Mother I have...'

1010
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:48,114
So I say; 'All right baba now I have to suffer to please you people.'

1011
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:50,072
For Priya.

1012
01:11:53,574 --> 01:11:55,939
This is what is very simple to understand

1013
01:11:56,637 --> 01:11:58,637
that you should not force Me to eat.

1014
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,448
At all, there's no need to force Me.

1015
01:12:00,811 --> 01:12:03,922
Don't force anyone to eat 'though I do force people to eat

1016
01:12:04,252 --> 01:12:06,554
because I know they need it. But you cannot do it.

1017
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:09,517
You have no discretion. When you have discretion,

1018
01:12:09,799 --> 01:12:11,973
whom to force whom not to force, then it's all right.

1019
01:12:12,582 --> 01:12:16,161
Also when you force you must know that the food has to be vibrated.

1020
01:12:16,973 --> 01:12:19,326
If it is not vibrated food if you force the person,

1021
01:12:19,572 --> 01:12:20,245
he'll have trouble.

1022
01:12:24,842 --> 01:12:26,971
Now for all of you to understand

1023
01:12:27,185 --> 01:12:29,490
the importance of vishuddhi chakra is

1024
01:12:29,735 --> 01:12:31,933
first and foremost thing is that when you speak

1025
01:12:31,983 --> 01:12:33,983
you must speak about Sahaja Yoga and nothing else.

1026
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,791
If you have to give speech - I have known many Sahaja Yogis

1027
01:12:38,847 --> 01:12:41,592
you see who are still member of this organization,

1028
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:43,557
member of that organization,

1029
01:12:43,637 --> 01:12:50,430
member of this thing of horrible organizations which are anti God.

1030
01:12:51,756 --> 01:12:53,647
Say now for example we'll see

1031
01:12:53,745 --> 01:12:57,987
Hari Rama Hari Krishna organization is anti Christ, anti.

1032
01:12:58,088 --> 01:13:00,088
It is of course anti Christ openly

1033
01:13:00,423 --> 01:13:03,117
and in the real sense is anti Krishna.

1034
01:13:03,343 --> 01:13:04,486
Absolutely Krishna.

1035
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,238
Every person who goes there and begs

1036
01:13:07,488 --> 01:13:09,916
in the name of God has a horrible vishuddhi

1037
01:13:10,593 --> 01:13:13,397
and they all suffer ultimately from vishuddhi troubles;

1038
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:15,856
cancer - this that and they die.

1039
01:13:17,748 --> 01:13:20,952
And the face of a person who has a good vishuddhi is blooming,

1040
01:13:21,373 --> 01:13:28,373
is wide, is full of....full, full like a full moon.

1041
01:13:29,519 --> 01:13:32,268
And if you have a face which is all shut down

1042
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,884
that means your vishuddhi is not all right.

1043
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:39,606
If the vishuddhi is functioning when there has to be glow on the face.

1044
01:13:40,172 --> 01:13:44,609
The face should be full and nourished and sparkling.

1045
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:47,837
And eyes should be sparkling because vishuddhi chakra also

1046
01:13:47,909 --> 01:13:52,251
looks after the eyes. It looks after the neck. It looks after the ears.

1047
01:13:52,504 --> 01:13:53,974
It looks after the nose.

1048
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:56,090
If your vishuddhi chakras are spoiled

1049
01:13:56,275 --> 01:13:58,776
you have problems with all E.N.T. things.

1050
01:14:01,028 --> 01:14:03,724
So the people who are like that;

1051
01:14:03,905 --> 01:14:07,221
like this you see we can say the man who was the leader

1052
01:14:07,483 --> 01:14:08,844
of that organization.

1053
01:14:09,185 --> 01:14:11,185
They think they are doing Hari Rama Hari Krishna.

1054
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:14,878
Actually they are doing absolutely anti, anti Krishna activities.

1055
01:14:15,014 --> 01:14:17,918
Absolutely. You have no business to call

1056
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,728
Krishna's name like this, like mad,

1057
01:14:19,787 --> 01:14:23,172
standing before all the people wearing these horrible dresses

1058
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:26,748
of these dhoti and kurtas and which they

1059
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:30,242
are absolutely done in a very funny way. They don't know how to wear it;

1060
01:14:30,326 --> 01:14:31,863
the women wearing their saris

1061
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:34,514
and men buying those bhodis and

1062
01:14:34,543 --> 01:14:37,047
putting them on their head and shaving their heads.

1063
01:14:37,314 --> 01:14:38,620
Did Krishna shave His head?

1064
01:14:40,064 --> 01:14:41,816
Did He ever shave His head? Head..

1065
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:45,416
the hair are actually the part of Krishna's gift.

1066
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:49,240
On the contrary He.. His hair are always described.

1067
01:14:50,489 --> 01:14:52,026
Always described in the poetry.

1068
01:14:56,013 --> 01:15:00,143
There is a story about a great Urdu poet

1069
01:15:00,614 --> 01:15:04,585
who was an Indian.. who was a Hindu, but Urdu poet

1070
01:15:04,718 --> 01:15:08,550
and some fanatics you see challenged him. So

1071
01:15:09,086 --> 01:15:12,540
this...they put one couplet and they said: 'you better complete this.'

1072
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:17,358
So he said: '...'

1073
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:27,441
So he completed it like this: '...'

1074
01:15:31,271 --> 01:15:34,271
His hair are described in every poetry are used.

1075
01:15:34,457 --> 01:15:37,666
Here they are shaving their heads, putting these bhodies on their heads

1076
01:15:37,963 --> 01:15:44,497
and walking about. When did Krishna had bald head?

1077
01:15:44,722 --> 01:15:48,315
Did He have a bald head? He is Yogeshwera with

1078
01:15:48,338 --> 01:15:51,364
sixteen thousand wives; means sixteen thousand powers.

1079
01:15:51,435 --> 01:15:54,612
He didn't have Sahaja Yogis to work out, so He got them as wives.

1080
01:15:55,045 --> 01:15:58,309
They were all yoginis within.

1081
01:16:00,375 --> 01:16:04,650
He created all this drama and He got them as wives because

1082
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:07,870
a man, if he has any women as disciples,

1083
01:16:08,329 --> 01:16:12,456
then naturally he is blamed and as a man he has to have powers

1084
01:16:12,587 --> 01:16:16,190
in the women. Women are always the power - the shakti.

1085
01:16:16,533 --> 01:16:18,971
So they came as His wives and He became

1086
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:22,293
the husband of sixteen thousand wives

1087
01:16:22,421 --> 01:16:27,143
and the five Ranis He had were the five elements within Him.

1088
01:16:28,776 --> 01:16:29,856
He played all the tricks.

1089
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:32,345
He created.....you you how will you know about Him?

1090
01:16:32,605 --> 01:16:34,274
How far can you go understanding Him?

1091
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:43,507
So these people who are trying to call Shri Krishna every moment,

1092
01:16:44,172 --> 01:16:47,877
every minute, standing on the streets and begging in His name.

1093
01:16:47,933 --> 01:16:50,117
All over the places begging like beggars.

1094
01:16:51,988 --> 01:16:55,488
Krishna couldn't stand begging at all. Never. He believed in

1095
01:16:55,716 --> 01:16:59,072
having a right. He would steal than to beg.

1096
01:17:03,123 --> 01:17:05,890
All these beggars being created in the name of God.

1097
01:17:06,008 --> 01:17:08,008
I think is one of the greatest sins

1098
01:17:08,594 --> 01:17:10,359
to beg in the name of God.

1099
01:17:11,007 --> 01:17:14,208
I have seen this happening before the temples and all that

1100
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:17,586
and I used to think; 'before the temple in front of God

1101
01:17:17,643 --> 01:17:23,220
to stand and beg. To be a fakir means to beg. What is this?

1102
01:17:24,657 --> 01:17:26,657
Is this the sign of a basha.

1103
01:17:28,497 --> 01:17:30,733
Shri Krishna was  a Batshawa, Yogeshwera

1104
01:17:30,982 --> 01:17:34,380
and these beggars, they are the followers of Shri Krishna?'

1105
01:17:34,552 --> 01:17:39,074
Horrible things. They look so miserable and they are

1106
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:42,449
absolutely like cabbages and many people believe

1107
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:43,946
that they are in peace.

1108
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:48,447
Naturally if you are living in a smashana you are in peace;

1109
01:17:49,643 --> 01:17:54,564
in a dead condition. And our country, which is a poor country

1110
01:17:54,615 --> 01:17:56,742
supporting all these beggars here, all our rich people

1111
01:17:56,763 --> 01:17:58,098
have given them money and lands.

1112
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:02,566
Is this the way we are going to support these lamas

1113
01:18:02,584 --> 01:18:03,978
who come down from there

1114
01:18:04,178 --> 01:18:07,415
and these horrible people coming down

1115
01:18:07,669 --> 01:18:12,183
from the west. All the people who cannot work.

1116
01:18:12,442 --> 01:18:15,101
Very nice come here say: 'hari Rama hari Krishna',

1117
01:18:15,268 --> 01:18:18,746
and read Gita and say some few words by heart

1118
01:18:18,898 --> 01:18:21,248
and then you earn your living here - nicely living.

1119
01:18:21,454 --> 01:18:24,535
Every village there is one or two sitting there

1120
01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:25,949
and begging. Can you believe it?

1121
01:18:26,235 --> 01:18:28,235
And our government is not bothered about it;

1122
01:18:29,766 --> 01:18:34,061
to find out who are these people, why are they here?

1123
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:36,901
In the name of God why are they begging like this?

1124
01:18:37,141 --> 01:18:40,028
and we have so many poor people who are

1125
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:42,522
begging in the name of God. Why not collect them and help them

1126
01:18:42,726 --> 01:18:44,461
instead of helping these horrible people?

1127
01:18:46,462 --> 01:18:49,895
Like this, you see, people have anti God activities

1128
01:18:50,419 --> 01:18:52,226
and anti Krishna activities.

1129
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:58,232
When you take the name of God in vain - vishuddhi catches.

1130
01:19:01,131 --> 01:19:04,029
I have known people sitting 'warguru warguru warguru'

1131
01:19:04,464 --> 01:19:06,927
Is it so..Nanak Sahib is so cheap that

1132
01:19:06,977 --> 01:19:09,201
we should go on taking His name 'warguru warguru warguru?'

1133
01:19:09,582 --> 01:19:12,254
They'll go on having the mala in the hand all the time.

1134
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:17,188
What is this going on? What do you think God to be? Is He in your pocket?

1135
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:20,951
Is He so cheaply available that you just go on

1136
01:19:21,197 --> 01:19:24,528
doing all these things? Why? You spoil your vishuddhi completely.

1137
01:19:26,347 --> 01:19:29,580
One must understand. When... you see, you are surprised at...

1138
01:19:29,908 --> 01:19:32,363
It is said that: '...'

1139
01:19:34,073 --> 01:19:38,676
Still people start doing it. Karaka means what? Vishuddhi chakra.

1140
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:42,078
That's how you spoil your vishuddhi chakra. That's how you spoil your

1141
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:47,392
main chakra of attaining realization.

1142
01:19:49,647 --> 01:19:52,226
So if you have to become one with the whole,

1143
01:19:52,553 --> 01:19:54,880
please try to keep your vishuddhi chakra clear.

1144
01:19:55,427 --> 01:19:58,461
Getting into colds because these days India

1145
01:19:58,606 --> 01:20:00,606
especially...any, everywhere even in...

1146
01:20:00,687 --> 01:20:04,626
women have a special tendency not to cover their body

1147
01:20:04,794 --> 01:20:07,732
because they think they are not looking very fashionable or whatever it is.

1148
01:20:07,849 --> 01:20:09,514
Is a very modern stuff has started

1149
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:14,956
that they want to wear scanty dresses. This is all anti God in both ways.

1150
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:17,411
Firstly it is nonsensical

1151
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:20,886
to show off your body. That's why Mohammed Sahib said -

1152
01:20:20,909 --> 01:20:23,118
you see He has worked so much on vishuddhi chakra -

1153
01:20:23,191 --> 01:20:24,624
that women should cover their body.

1154
01:20:24,859 --> 01:20:26,568
Is a very good thing I sometimes think.

1155
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:31,420
This nonsense of fashion has gone to such a limit

1156
01:20:31,832 --> 01:20:34,301
that after some time you'll find all these

1157
01:20:34,343 --> 01:20:36,343
mosquitoes walking around without any clothes.

1158
01:20:39,305 --> 01:20:42,291
That's the ultimate. You see is a sign of people who are,

1159
01:20:42,368 --> 01:20:46,656
who are neither 'he' nor 'she'. The 'it' people do that way.

1160
01:20:47,733 --> 01:20:52,095
Yes always. 'It' are the people who have qualities. That's why Rajneesh,

1161
01:20:52,341 --> 01:20:54,341
when people go to them, they become 'it'.

1162
01:20:55,482 --> 01:20:58,633
Because that is their capacity: no shame at all left in them.

1163
01:21:00,554 --> 01:21:03,524
And that is what it is, one has to understand that you should be

1164
01:21:03,581 --> 01:21:05,093
careful about your throats.

1165
01:21:06,766 --> 01:21:08,365
The fashions and all these things

1166
01:21:08,395 --> 01:21:11,072
are not so important. What is important is your health.

1167
01:21:11,282 --> 01:21:13,915
If you spoil your vishuddhi it's a very wrong thing

1168
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:16,829
and one should try to look after vishuddhi all the time

1169
01:21:18,264 --> 01:21:21,335
and all of you should try to look after each other's vishuddhi.

1170
01:21:21,386 --> 01:21:24,170
Because I didn't like the idea of having this pendal here

1171
01:21:24,265 --> 01:21:26,360
and I told the organizers this was a wrong thing.

1172
01:21:26,899 --> 01:21:28,899
So they said; 'You said it should be in the open.' I said:

1173
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,325
'now I'm not saying you go to Himalayas.'

1174
01:21:31,959 --> 01:21:34,545
You must use discretion. That's the part missing.

1175
01:21:37,015 --> 01:21:38,086
You must have discretion.

1176
01:21:38,784 --> 01:21:44,324
To give people a thing in the mid-winter such a place;

1177
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:47,518
I mean I must say you people are great seekers to be here.

1178
01:21:48,132 --> 01:21:50,961
This is not proper thing to do. So the organizers,

1179
01:21:51,152 --> 01:21:53,074
the people who are dealing with the collectivity,

1180
01:21:53,121 --> 01:21:57,247
must know that they should do something to protect the throat of people,

1181
01:21:57,507 --> 01:22:01,654
to protect the vishuddhu chakra. It's very important.

1182
01:22:02,826 --> 01:22:05,570
Very important and you all know how I

1183
01:22:05,715 --> 01:22:09,554
care for your vishuddhi chakras; everybody's vishuddhi chakra.

1184
01:22:09,838 --> 01:22:12,586
Because I know how important it is. Because it will

1185
01:22:12,895 --> 01:22:15,132
make you absolutely disintegrated

1186
01:22:16,157 --> 01:22:18,733
and it will spoil all the work of Kundalini

1187
01:22:18,804 --> 01:22:20,320
and poor Kundalini will suffer so.

1188
01:22:21,971 --> 01:22:24,760
So we have to take it upon yourselves

1189
01:22:25,076 --> 01:22:27,076
that we'll keep our vishuddhi chakra clean.

1190
01:22:27,371 --> 01:22:29,371
We'll clean ourselves properly

1191
01:22:29,558 --> 01:22:32,357
and we'll clean our throats every morning

1192
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:36,311
and we'll take gargling and everything and look after our vishuddhi chakra.

1193
01:22:36,436 --> 01:22:38,420
It looks very mundane but for a Mother

1194
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:41,236
mundane things are as important as higher things are.

1195
01:22:41,544 --> 01:22:43,363
Because if there is no vishuddhi chakra

1196
01:22:43,646 --> 01:22:48,727
what's the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga -  with a bad vishuddhi chakra?

1197
01:22:50,384 --> 01:22:53,142
So please try to look after your vishuddhi chakra.

1198
01:22:53,626 --> 01:22:55,626
Try to put Yogeshwera there.

1199
01:22:56,470 --> 01:23:00,862
Try to raise Shri Krishna there, try to be like Him.

1200
01:23:01,808 --> 01:23:05,461
Keep your understanding that

1201
01:23:05,678 --> 01:23:08,760
you are here to witness the drama of God

1202
01:23:09,102 --> 01:23:14,634
and to be the murlee of Shri Krishna to watch

1203
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:17,131
the beautiful melody flowing through you.

1204
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:21,961
May God bless you all.

1205
01:23:28,333 --> 01:23:31,159
Now what is today also

1206
01:23:31,389 --> 01:23:33,926
they don't want anyone to touch My feet. I hope

1207
01:23:34,061 --> 01:23:40,299
today you will obey without any exception.

1208
01:23:40,575 --> 01:23:41,785
Yesterday we tried

1209
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:45,010
but there were exceptions so today there should be no apowadas.

1210
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:45,800
Let us see.

1211
01:23:46,262 --> 01:23:49,457
One day we should not touch Mother's feet. Doesn't matter.

1212
01:23:49,533 --> 01:23:50,760
You all can touch from there

1213
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:54,139
and there is a way of collectively touching Mother's feet

1214
01:23:54,312 --> 01:23:56,972
is the way we do always. You can all do it

1215
01:23:57,097 --> 01:24:00,893
just now but we need not actually touch, but you are actually touching.

1216
01:24:02,054 --> 01:24:04,372
Even touching the mother earth you are touching.

1217
01:24:05,494 --> 01:24:08,328
Just touch the mother earth and you are there.

1218
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:18,881
Just touch the mother earth; you will find the Kundalini rising.

1219
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:30,087
You haven't given Me any questions whatsoever

1220
01:24:30,397 --> 01:24:33,739
and those who have questions should write questions and give it to Me,

1221
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:35,710
because once I'll go away then you will say:

1222
01:24:35,747 --> 01:24:40,959
'Mother never allowed us to ask any questions.' I did say there are....
