1
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:28,523
I hope you all are meditating every morning

2
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:31,736
and talking Sahaja Yoga, meeting each
other,

3
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:39,159
and this is more to get together that we
should all discuss about Sahaja Yoga

4
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,750
and find out what is the way we can do it
better.

5
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:50,125
Morning time I was thinking that we can
allot it now to people

6
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:52,826
who would like to have a sort of a,

7
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:57,518
they call it a brain trust sort of a thing,
a conference. You could have it.

8
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,040
Of course, day after tomorrow we are all
very free. I’m sorry,

9
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:05,965
tomorrow is the Puja but day after tomorrow
we are free in the morning time

10
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:10,838
and also ninth we are free. So you all
could discuss and talk about things

11
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,843
and about what has happened in Satara
district

12
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:23,678
and all those things can be discussed among
all of you and it can be established

13
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:29,363
that we understand Sahaja Yoga properly
among ourselves.

14
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:34,092
Many people do not know much about
Sahaja Yoga, especially ladies.

15
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:36,613
I think they have to know quite a lot.

16
00:04:36,814 --> 00:04:40,040
They just think they are in Sahaja Yoga;
so they are floating

17
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:48,200
with the big flow of water. That’s not
the way to know about Sahaja Yoga.

18
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:51,869
Sahaja Yoga you must know precisely, must
know what is,

19
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,860
what is there, what is not there. So I
would say that you could have a meeting

20
00:04:56,061 --> 00:05:00,296
tomorrow sometime or, I’m sorry, day after
tomorrow, sometime

21
00:05:00,497 --> 00:05:04,734
and could discuss about what is it and how
it helps you,

22
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:09,822
what are the chakras are, any problems,
anything. We have all kinds of people here.

23
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:12,869
So it should not be just entertainment
but it should be

24
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:18,392
more sort of a morning session for learning
things.

25
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:25,608
We have, now tomorrow is a very important
day for Puja.

26
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:29,417
All of you are expected to come here for
the Puja

27
00:05:29,618 --> 00:05:38,700
and I’m sure that it will help you all
to achieve something in that Puja.

28
00:05:38,914 --> 00:05:41,855
As it is, you know that you have to go
beyond your thoughts

29
00:05:42,056 --> 00:05:47,520
to absorb the vibrations. In your thoughts
you get lost.

30
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:51,497
but once you are above the thoughts you
get absorbed.

31
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:56,753
Also most of the marriages have been fixed.
But some people unnecessarily

32
00:05:56,954 --> 00:06:04,777
giving way to their conditionings or maybe
unnecessary thinking and all that

33
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:09,635
have tried to say “No” to certain people
without any rhyme and reason,

34
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,086
without any rhyme and reason. So it is
nonsense.

35
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:17,649
And such people, I would say, that should
not apply anymore

36
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:21,222
because we have wasted so much time. Of
course, if they had some rhyme and reason

37
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,147
one can understand but without rhyme and
reason if you say,

38
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:28,560
“We don’t want to marry,” that mean it’s
quite insulting to the other party.

39
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:33,723
So if you have just said “No” because you
feel it from your heart

40
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:38,436
and from your brain and from your these
things, this is not the way to behave.

41
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:42,961
And before saying “No” you should see Me
and I would request you, all of you,

42
00:06:43,162 --> 00:06:48,792
to meet your fiancés and see for yourself.
Even now there is time.

43
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:53,147
But if there is no reason for saying “No”,

44
00:06:53,363 --> 00:07:00,504
if there is no understanding about any
point,

45
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:06,199
it is better to decide it now than to decide
it later. Now I’ve been telling you.

46
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,503
Of course, you have all the freedom
to do it.

47
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:13,401
But for no rhyme and reason you have no
business to insult other people.

48
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:18,648
So I would request you that even if you
have any objections, even now,

49
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,568
please write it down and give it to Yogi
Mahajan.

50
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:26,235
He has really worked very hard and you know
we have no choices.

51
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:29,979
You see, it is very funny how so many
marriages have come up. I didn’t expect

52
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,356
even to fix ten marriages,  because the age
and the heights

53
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:39,711
and everything was so much from one
extreme to another extreme.

54
00:07:40,973 --> 00:07:45,533
Moreover, those ladies who have got
children and all that, it’s rather difficult

55
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:50,517
because we find people who are not very
happy about the situation.

56
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:54,773
So they should not feel bad about it.
We hope to see people

57
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:59,092
who would love to have children. All such
people should come forward

58
00:07:59,293 --> 00:08:03,375
and they should marry women who have
children and look after them.

59
00:08:03,576 --> 00:08:08,580
But it’s difficult. In the same way for men
also, if they have

60
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:12,568
some children or something, there is
a problem.

61
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:16,385
But one should not feel bad about it.
One should know that we are here

62
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:20,864
for our Sahaja Yoga, for our ascent, and we
have to rise higher.

63
00:08:21,957 --> 00:08:25,975
As it is, you know, one or two marriages
do fail in Sahaja Yoga

64
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:30,644
and they create lot of problems for Me. But
is this the way are you helping Me?

65
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:34,944
I am helping you in so many ways. Which
is the way are you going to help Me

66
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:40,738
is to understand that if we are married
let us try to improve ourselves.

67
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:45,698
Of course, I would say that certain
problems come only from one side,

68
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,900
not from both the sides, but whatever it is

69
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:52,716
we have to understand that these marriages
are not just for marriages

70
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:58,131
but for something great, to create a new
progeny of realized souls,

71
00:08:58,332 --> 00:09:04,019
to emancipate human beings. There are many
saints who want to be born on this earth.

72
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:12,118
So it is important that if you are married
in that understanding

73
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:17,369
then you will try to see to the good points
of others and not the bad points,

74
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,284
and should not see superficial things.

75
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:23,547
If you are superficial it is better you
don’t marry.

76
00:09:23,717 --> 00:09:28,768
But if you have any depth then you should
understand you are marrying for something

77
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:34,067
that is the concern of God’s work.

78
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:38,607
I hope by this you’ll be able to sort out
many of your problems.

79
00:09:38,808 --> 00:09:42,196
And then some people when they get married
they just get headlong,

80
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:48,603
absolutely get lost into it. This is the
another stupid conditioning of romanticism.

81
00:09:48,804 --> 00:09:52,654
You have married because you are in Sahaja
Yoga, you want to help the Sahaj Yoga,

82
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:56,961
you would like to have a companion who
will be helpful in Sahaja Yoga.

83
00:09:57,961 --> 00:10:02,940
But they get so headlong into it that I’ve
seen many characters have been ruined

84
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:08,033
and people have been spoilt. But in a way
it’s good because this is Last Judgment.

85
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:13,499
If by marriage, by temptations, by wrong
doings, by conditionings,

86
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,504
if you have to go out, you have to go out.

87
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:22,865
I must tell you that also there’s very
little place in the kingdom of God.

88
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:27,221
Unless and until you prove to be good
Sahaja Yogis there is no place for you.

89
00:10:27,422 --> 00:10:31,972
For mediocres there is no place. You have
to be serious, deep,

90
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:37,339
seeking, dedicated Sahaja Yogis. Otherwise
you have no place.

91
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,045
If you are playing around only with your
children, with your wife,

92
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:44,999
then all right; go ahead with it. You have
to get out of that

93
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,793
and you must know that my first and
foremost attention should be on Sahaja Yoga.

94
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:51,929
That is so very important today.

95
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:58,393
Formerly, that’s why people used to give
sanyasa to their disciples.

96
00:10:58,863 --> 00:11:03,521
No marriage, no children, no household.
Just be sanyasis.

97
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:08,603
So complete dedication to the guru,
complete dedication to the work.

98
00:11:08,804 --> 00:11:12,945
But in Sahaja Yoga it is not so. Because
also I have given you realization

99
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:16,646
so you can feel it within yourselves what
is important.

100
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:21,534
If something goes wrong with you then
the vibrations also go down.

101
00:11:21,735 --> 00:11:27,707
Then also I have reports, say, from many
countries that people are very miserly.

102
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:32,340
They do not donate for daily work.
Of course, you don’t have to pay Me

103
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,606
but you must know that without donation
we cannot do anything,

104
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:40,384
you cannot even buy a little thing like
that, and from where it has to come?

105
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:44,323
Of course, as far as possible I’ve tried
to compensate

106
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:47,524
but also you must know my husband is now
retiring.

107
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:53,007
So I hope the whole, with his retirement,
the whole of Sahaja Yoga will not collapse.

108
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:57,433
If you are such miserly people, only
worried about your money,

109
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:03,183
you want to extract each and every pie you
spend, each and every

110
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:09,835
little money you have given, then I must say
such people are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

111
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:12,704
Such calculating people, nobody wants
to shell out.

112
00:12:12,896 --> 00:12:18,753
I mean, I’ve seen people, even if they give
a little bottle of, say, Limca to someone,

113
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:22,590
they want to charge it. If you are that
miserly

114
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:27,444
there is no place for miserly people
in the kingdom of God.

115
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:32,406
You have to be generous, you have to look
after people, you have to love each other,

116
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:37,815
you have to give presents to others and you
have to be very much giving.

117
00:12:38,016 --> 00:12:43,798
And in this I find that people will live in
a good house, they’ll have a good family,

118
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:48,565
they will spend on their children, for
their holidays, for their education,

119
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:51,882
for everything. But Sahaja Yoga, they
become very miserly.

120
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:56,279
So they are still so conditioned. So this
is the Last Judgment.

121
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,639
And you will be judged for everything
that you do for Sahaja Yoga.

122
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,502
Is one has to be very careful as to how
you behave,

123
00:13:04,703 --> 00:13:08,508
what is your attitude is and how you should
change.

124
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:12,555
Your attention is also very important,
if your attention is not there.

125
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:17,354
I’ve seen some people still sitting
outside, talking to people, doing this.

126
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:20,403
In between the program they just get up
and walk off.

127
00:13:20,604 --> 00:13:26,610
When there’s an, some, some artist is
sitting you are not to go like that.

128
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,717
It’s an insult to the artist. I, I just sit
for hours together.

129
00:13:31,906 --> 00:13:36,115
And if I am supposed to be your Guru, you
must learn at least that much from Me,

130
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:40,641
how to respect and where to respect. So
I have seen many people just getting up,

131
00:13:40,842 --> 00:13:44,874
walking, sleeping down, this, that. If you
are that kind

132
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,886
then you should sit on the corner and just
disappear.

133
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:51,590
Nobody should walk this way back and this
way. It’s not proper.

134
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:56,752
There should be, if you go to your church,
do you do like that?

135
00:13:56,982 --> 00:14:03,807
Church which is based on falsehood?
While this is the church of truth.

136
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:09,116
And the way people take things without
any discipline looks very funny.

137
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:12,563
People start walking up and down, sitting
the way they like.

138
00:14:12,771 --> 00:14:16,063
There’s no alertness about them.
This is all…

139
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:21,052
You must know when the music is on,
I am trying to spread

140
00:14:21,253 --> 00:14:25,230
vibrations through that music. But some
people are dozing off.

141
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:30,233
Some people are walking about. That is not
a Sahaja Yogi.

142
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:33,876
You have to be just Spartan and smart.

143
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:38,278
Like any, if you see a saint, you see,
if you see old saints we had,

144
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:42,348
their disciples used to be sitting straight
before him for hours together.

145
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:45,534
Of course, I don’t say that you should sit
here hours together

146
00:14:45,735 --> 00:14:50,150
but if I am sitting here you have no
business to behave like this dog

147
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:54,292
that runs about without knowing what
he’s doing.

148
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:01,334
We are all human beings and there’s no,
no reasoning behind it.

149
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:04,508
I don’t understand - And there’s no
explanation needed.

150
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:06,689
It’s the behavior itself is wrong.

151
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:11,003
Now anybody who has children and all that
should sit on the other side.

152
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:14,130
I would not like you to carry your children
here and there

153
00:15:14,177 --> 00:15:16,478
when there is some program is going on.

154
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:19,501
We have to show at least this much
of discipline.

155
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:24,043
So yesterday’s program was a little bit
a farce, perhaps maybe because

156
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:28,812
some people really behaved in a manner
that they should not have behaved.

157
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:32,834
All such people who want to go like that
should wait

158
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:37,761
because in between the program we’ll give
you some interval when you can go out.

159
00:15:37,962 --> 00:15:43,774
So let us have a society, a proper

160
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:54,015
beautifully built-up collectivity which
shows that we are very saintly people.

161
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:57,981
We have poise, we have adjustments, we have
understanding,

162
00:15:58,182 --> 00:16:03,063
we are doing everything in such a manner
that it is all dignified.

163
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:08,648
Now also some people have a bad habit
of raising their Kundalini

164
00:16:08,849 --> 00:16:11,059
in the program, suddenly giving bandhans,

165
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,955
giving bandhans to themselves, bandhans
to others. Is nonsense.

166
00:16:15,455 --> 00:16:19,081
Just now I am there. You don’t have to.
Just you desire.

167
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:23,009
You just try to develop your desire power
and just desire.

168
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,699
You desire something; it will work out.

169
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:32,021
I mean, I work like that and you should
learn this trick, how to desire.

170
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:36,827
But desire should be pure desire. Then
Kundalini works it out.

171
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:41,531
I was in Kolhapur and I was telling him,
our Yogi Mahajan,

172
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:46,867
I want to buy those chimtas for the,
for the,

173
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:54,159
we should say all the countries, western
countries and also the leaders.

174
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,419
And just imagine, they said that you can’t
get them in Kolhapur.

175
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,475
And there they are; they have bought it
and brought it.

176
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:03,814
I mean, it’s a small incident but there are
thousand one things I can tell you.

177
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:08,640
I have to just desire. I desired that
the Eastern bloc

178
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:11,815
must be cleared out, must be freed.

179
00:17:12,016 --> 00:17:19,080
So a program of Sahaja Yoga, of what you
call the Yoga seminar, was held in Russia.

180
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:22,794
And I told My husband and I told everyone,
“I’m going there

181
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:26,491
to break the Eastern bloc.” I just told.

182
00:17:26,752 --> 00:17:29,862
When I went there they gave Me hardly
any time.

183
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:32,684
But I broke it because the people who got
realization,

184
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:37,471
they were from all these countries and they
just went and triggered it.

185
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:40,088
So I had told beforehand that this is
My purpose

186
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:45,032
but I am so intensely desiring anything;

187
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:48,458
in the same way if you have a pure desire
about it,

188
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:57,393
not from any, any malicious or some sort
of a selfish attitude.

189
00:17:57,594 --> 00:18:02,579
Like my brother, my sister, my... this is
Indians have this greater problem…

190
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,610
my wife, this, that. The wife will support
the husband,

191
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:09,351
the husband will support the wife,
nonsensical things will go on.

192
00:18:09,552 --> 00:18:14,014
But by this they are really taking them
down.

193
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,343
And you people also should not sort
of have, because somebody

194
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:23,690
is from, say, Switzerland, Swiss people
will sit together.

195
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:27,710
It’s a very wrong thing to do. I’ve told
hundred times, nobody from the same….

196
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:31,979
Now I can see it’s even that the same thing
happening here.

197
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:35,492
English must sit together. And English have
the worst habit in this,

198
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:39,820
that they must form a group. That’s their
style, is to have their group.

199
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:44,767
So this is all is our conditioning. You see,
why I am telling you

200
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:49,973
that Sahaja Yoga is not going to benefit
by you but you have to be benefited.

201
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:53,563
So all these little, little conditionings
that you have, you just judge yourself:

202
00:18:53,974 --> 00:18:57,783
“Are we doing like that?”; “Are we
sitting?”; “Am I sitting next to a Swiss?”;

203
00:18:57,984 --> 00:19:01,213
“Am I sitting next to an English?”.
Run away.

204
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,887
And then maybe that you think you can speak
in the same language

205
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:08,626
or whatever it is. No. Let us sit away.

206
00:19:08,827 --> 00:19:11,928
Then Delhi people will sit together, Bombay
people will sit together

207
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:15,413
and you ask them, “Do you know this lady?”
“No, who was she?”

208
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:18,036
“I mean, she was there.” “No, I never
met her.”

209
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:23,436
Because nobody wants to meet, nobody wants
to talk, nobody wants to know.

210
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:27,346
And it is to be understood that this is
a place of pilgrimage,

211
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:31,214
there’s no fashion show on.  And one should
not go about putting

212
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:36,086
fashionable clothes and fashionable dresses
and... Be humble about it.

213
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:39,903
This is sometimes I’m really shocked
the way people are dressing up.

214
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:42,650
It’s all right, for Pujas and all that,
you can come.

215
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:45,815
But the way people are dressed up sometimes
it’s surprising.

216
00:19:46,016 --> 00:19:49,526
You are coming here, for what? For your
meditation.

217
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:55,035
So be in a simpler dress, in a simpler
attitude, in a simpler mind.

218
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:58,497
Today I have to tell you because I’ve been
noticing few things

219
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:04,316
that you are missing the point. We are
here for our ascent.

220
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:10,426
We have come all the way. Pilgrimage is
there for your ascent and for nothing else.

221
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:14,866
We are here only for our ascent, for our
joy,

222
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:18,664
for opening out ourselves. And that is
what we have to remember.

223
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:22,154
I’m your Mother. I have to tell you
the truth because it is your benevolence

224
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:26,029
that I want, that you all should become
great foundations

225
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,621
of Sahaja Yoga which is going to emancipate
the whole world.

226
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:33,407
Moreover, anybody who is sick need not come
to Me.

227
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:37,163
You can cure that person with it. You can
yourself cure.

228
00:20:37,364 --> 00:20:44,249
This person who is a realized soul can cure
himself or herself, or you can cure.

229
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,070
What is the need to bring everybody to Me?
This is sick, that is sick,

230
00:20:48,271 --> 00:20:50,569
that is there. No need.

231
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,034
Among yourselves only you can have these
things done,

232
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:58,798
and I think the doctors and all these people
can also have a little conference together,

233
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:03,110
and anybody who has problems can come and
tell them what’s the problem is.

234
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:06,232
And can be done. There’s also no need also
to have doctors.

235
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,924
We have some people here, very simple
people, who can help you a lot.

236
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,542
So among yourselves you should help and you
should learn how to do it:

237
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:16,925
how to raise the Kundalini; how to tie it
up; how to clear the chakras;

238
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:20,717
what’s wrong with you. Attention should be
how I am going to achieve it.

239
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:23,467
But the attention is not so high.

240
00:21:23,668 --> 00:21:28,556
So I would request you today that you
please pay full attention to the program

241
00:21:28,757 --> 00:21:35,708
and enjoy and really try to develop that
sensitivity of enjoyment.

242
00:21:35,948 --> 00:21:40,678
This is just you are clinging onto something
which is not going to take you

243
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:45,425
to the Ocean of Joy. All right?
May God bless you.
