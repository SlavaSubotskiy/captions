1
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:14,399
Your eyes are very important

2
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,347
and play a very big part 
in this Swadishthana movement.

3
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:23,472
Now, those people who move their eyes 
too much here and there.

4
00:00:23,593 --> 00:00:25,965
You see, I don’t know, 
his is the modern style also,

5
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:29,845
too much to move, everything they must see…
like that they are going on, mad people.

6
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:32,377
I don’t know what is there 
to see like that, you see.

7
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:34,628
Actually, in former days, when we were young,

8
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:37,370
we were told to see the Mother Earth all the time,

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,804
not to raise your eyes higher than that.

10
00:00:39,924 --> 00:00:43,003
The reason is the Mother Earth soothes your eyes.

11
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:45,106
But if you want moving your eyes too much,

12
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:48,890
the attention is moving, wobbling, all the time.

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,813
Now the attention is sustained by liver.

14
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:56,543
If your liver is not all right, 
your attention cannot be all right.

15
00:00:56,663 --> 00:00:58,470
So those people who have a habit you see

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,138
– sometimes they’ll see through the back of their eyes,

17
00:01:01,258 --> 00:01:05,471
or from here – there – they think they are 
doing something great by doing these things –

18
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:08,288
such people can never have good livers.

19
00:01:08,408 --> 00:01:11,183
So to keep a good liver, keep your eyes down.

20
00:01:11,303 --> 00:01:13,195
Don’t give them too much work.

21
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:15,277
We are giving too much work to our eyes

22
00:01:15,397 --> 00:01:19,838
and that’s how it is keeping 
our attention all the time wobbled out,

23
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:24,795
and if your attention is out, 
then you can never feel happy.

24
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:28,476
So the liver sustains the attention

25
00:01:28,596 --> 00:01:34,023
and for you to be best Sahaja yogi is to
put your eyes down, on the Mother Earth.

26
00:01:34,143 --> 00:01:38,378
Walk with less raising of your eyes. 
Respect your eyes.

27
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:42,207
You’re not to waste your eyes 
on all the time anybody coming up your…

28
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:47,576
I’ve seen even in meditation 
people can’t keep their eyes straight.

29
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:50,964
You have to keep your eyes 
all the time in a mood

30
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:55,034
that you’re enjoying yourself, 
and not enjoying others.

31
00:01:55,155 --> 00:01:56,760
But you're just enjoying yourself.

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,620
You cannot enjoy others, 
you have to enjoy yourself,

33
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,342
to enjoy somebody else’s vibrations.

34
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:07,498
You can only enjoy others through their 
vibrations, not through their seeing.

35
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:10,661
And because of this, once you have 
this kind of a habit,

36
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:13,551
then your liver always gets into it.

37
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:17,870
Then you curse yourself, you do 
all kinds of things… that’s no good.

38
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,231
Just tell yourself, 
“Hold my eyes on the Mother Earth.”

39
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:26,614
She sustains, She takes away 
all your problems and everything.
