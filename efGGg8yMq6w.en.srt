1
00:00:01,461 --> 00:00:04,461
The question was asked Me,

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,045
“What Puja we are going to have today?”

3
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:13,295
And I kept it a secret.

4
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:23,337
Today we should worship

5
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:26,170
the Paramachaitanya,

6
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:30,254
the All-Pervading Power of God’s Love.

7
00:00:42,212 --> 00:00:44,628
We are aware

8
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:49,419
that Paramachaitanya

9
00:00:51,045 --> 00:00:53,586
does everything.

10
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:57,711
At least mentally we know

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,920
that everything is worked out

12
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:04,461
by the grace of Paramachaitanya,

13
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,753
which is the power of the Adi Shakti.

14
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:12,628
But still,

15
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:19,087
it is not so much in our heart,

16
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:30,045
so much in our attention.

17
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,878
We can consider Paramachaitanya

18
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:39,795
like a ocean,

19
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:46,420
like a ocean which contains everything within itself.

20
00:01:47,545 --> 00:01:51,087
Everything, all the working,

21
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:57,461
everything, is within its own limits.

22
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,461
So it cannot be compared with anything. You cannot compare it.

23
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,087
Now, if you see the sun,

24
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:10,170
then from the sun

25
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,670
the rays have to come out, to work it.

26
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:21,045
If you see somebody,

27
00:02:23,087 --> 00:02:26,711
say, a person

28
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:30,670
who has an authority,

29
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,920
he has to assert that power -

30
00:02:37,753 --> 00:02:40,045
outside.

31
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:43,379
So within himself

32
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:46,420
he doesn’t work it out.

33
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,461
Say, for example, if there’s a seed

34
00:03:00,503 --> 00:03:02,670
and inside the seed only

35
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:07,670
the tree grows, and the fruits come out, and

36
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:11,295
then they are sold, and people eat it, and

37
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:15,003
everything is inside that seed.

38
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:19,379
Then that is Paramachaitanya.

39
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:28,419
So we are all enveloped in it.

40
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:34,254
And only the waves that we see,

41
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,337
and we are on the waves,

42
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:41,254
so we see it as

43
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,586
dislocated, separated.

44
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:50,670
Like we feel “this is Germany”

45
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:56,837
or “this is England, this is India.”

46
00:03:57,087 --> 00:04:01,920
These are just folds of the sari

47
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:04,628
of Paramachaitanya

48
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:07,461
which look separated,

49
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:11,003
but they are not separated.

50
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:15,420
They are continuous.

51
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,045
So the connection is absolutely complete.

52
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:25,795
If I pull a thread from here,

53
00:04:26,003 --> 00:04:30,129
the thread will throughout be pulled.

54
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:37,129
In the same manner, this Paramachaitanya

55
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,920
is working within itself.

56
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,003
And there is nothing without.

57
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,711
So, when you are Sahaja Yogis,

58
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:04,295
it pays special attention to you.

59
00:05:04,545 --> 00:05:08,670
Or, I should say, it becomes absolutely

60
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:11,337
one with you.

61
00:05:11,503 --> 00:05:13,878
Whatever you desire,

62
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:17,254
whatever you want,

63
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,962
also will be coming from the same Paramachaitanya,

64
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,045
if you are one with it.

65
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:28,170
Like in a, say,

66
00:05:29,878 --> 00:05:33,419
turbulent ocean

67
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:39,795
some drops of water may fly into the air

68
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:44,337
and start thinking that “we are above.”

69
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:49,795
We’re away from the world, away from the ocean.

70
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:53,795
But again they have to fall into the sea.

71
00:05:56,795 --> 00:06:01,170
So this formless energy,

72
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:07,295
which has all the intelligence, all the coordination,

73
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:09,586
all the organizations,

74
00:06:09,795 --> 00:06:12,337
all the computers,

75
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:16,379
all the televisions,

76
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:21,087
all that you can think of communication

77
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:24,711
and of governing, of administration,

78
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,670
and above all,

79
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:33,420
it is the Love,

80
00:06:34,337 --> 00:06:37,379
it is the Love of God

81
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:42,295
and Love of your Mother.

82
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:54,129
So to be one with this Paramachaitanya,

83
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,628
you have to know

84
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:03,837
that you have to become the reality.

85
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:13,962
For example, if you take a photograph of Mine, sitting here,

86
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:22,711
Maybe My photograph might give you living vibrations, all right,

87
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:27,795
though it’s a photograph.

88
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:37,419
But, if you take a photograph of somebody else

89
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:46,628
it will not work out Sahaja Yoga.

90
00:07:48,753 --> 00:07:53,628
The reason is, that somebody else has not become the reality.

91
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:57,254
It’s like any other painting if you see,

92
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,337
supposing you see a painting

93
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:03,878
where it is raining.

94
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:07,503
This rain does not nourish the flowers.

95
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:10,003
It does not

96
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:20,087
wet the cloth of the people who are there.

97
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:23,003
It is static.

98
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,003
So in ignorance,

99
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:30,461
in ignorance,

100
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:34,878
we just have the

101
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,337
picture which is static about reality.

102
00:08:42,878 --> 00:08:45,795
And that is the reason why

103
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:49,254
we think we can work it out

104
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:52,545
ourselves, everything.

105
00:08:53,878 --> 00:08:58,962
Now if somebody says that, “I see this picture,

106
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:06,419
all right. And I’ll make the rain as a real thing.”

107
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:10,129
You cannot. Try anything,

108
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:12,753
put whatever color you like.

109
00:09:12,962 --> 00:09:15,837
It may appear, it will appear

110
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,795
with effort.

111
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:23,212
But it will not have the capacity,

112
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:29,461
nor the nature of reality.

113
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,503
So human beings always deal

114
00:09:36,545 --> 00:09:42,545
with unreal things, thinking they are doing something great.

115
00:09:44,795 --> 00:09:47,087
We can get flowers which are real, of course.

116
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,920
We can feel them.

117
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:55,628
We can create plastic flowers.

118
00:09:55,837 --> 00:10:00,337
We can create paintings, exactly the same as they are.

119
00:10:00,503 --> 00:10:05,087
But we can’t produce one flower

120
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:08,753
on our own.

121
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:18,461
We’ll have to go to reality

122
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:22,628
is that the Mother Earth is going to produce it,

123
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:29,545
or the Sun is going to help the Mother Earth.

124
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:38,295
So all of you Sahaja Yogis

125
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:43,295
have to know

126
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:48,254
that in reality you do not do anything

127
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,045
and everything is done by Paramachaitanya.

128
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:57,170
This is the difference between a non-Sahaja Yogi and a Sahaja Yogi.

129
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:02,420
A non-Sahaja Yogi does not know.

130
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:08,628
And even if he knows, this is not

131
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:11,545
the truth in his heart.

132
00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:14,670
It’s not a part and parcel of his being.

133
00:11:14,878 --> 00:11:19,419
But a Sahaja Yogi knows that

134
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:23,129
reality is Paramachaitanya

135
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:27,379
and it is reality that works out everything.

136
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:32,670
And then this reality is

137
00:11:32,878 --> 00:11:35,962
the Divine Love.

138
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:40,920
We always separate love from action.

139
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:45,170
To us love means

140
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:52,920
some sort of a mad behavior towards a person.

141
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,419
It has no technical know-how, how to love.

142
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:04,670
It works without any understanding.

143
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:09,295
When we love somebody,

144
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:13,419
we don’t know, what do we do?

145
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:17,170
We think we love you.

146
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:20,586
Tomorrow we start saying, “I hate you.”

147
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:24,129
So how can it be love?

148
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:31,962
We love our own children, love our own family,

149
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,670
love our own friends,

150
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,878
which is so unreal.

151
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:42,670
If it was real,

152
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,628
it would never have failed.

153
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:50,962
That you cannot definitely say

154
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,753
that, all right, today you’ll work for your son

155
00:12:53,962 --> 00:12:56,670
and be very selfish about your son.

156
00:12:56,878 --> 00:12:59,129
But you can’t say tomorrow how he will treat you

157
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:02,003
or you’ll treat him.

158
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:09,003
But Paramachaitanya knows.

159
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:14,212
It knows how to express its love.

160
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,878
Not only that,

161
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:22,586
but it’s an eternal feeling of love,

162
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:28,878
which may change its hue, color,

163
00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:34,254
but

164
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:39,837
the concern of that love will be the same.

165
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:43,837
The essence of love is concern.

166
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:48,461
Even if, supposing, somebody does wrong,

167
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,295
the concern of the Divine would be to correct that person.

168
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:55,003
Concern.

169
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:58,628
Or if we say as “Hita”,

170
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,337
is the benevolence.

171
00:14:01,503 --> 00:14:04,129
So the concern for the benevolence

172
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:06,461
will be all the time there,

173
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,129
whether it may appear to be, sometimes, cruel,

174
00:14:11,337 --> 00:14:13,837
might appear to be affectionate,

175
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:16,087
might appear to be over-indulgent.

176
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:19,962
Whatever it may take a form, like a wave.

177
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,379
Whichever way it may look, but actually,

178
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:28,003
it’s for your benevolence.

179
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:32,295
It works for your benevolence.

180
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:35,295
Not only your benevolence,

181
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:39,170
but the collective benevolence.

182
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:44,878
And it knows very well what is to be done

183
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:47,962
how it is to be worked out.

184
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:53,254
It does not have to go and learn from anywhere

185
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,878
because the complete knowledge of all this know-how

186
00:14:57,087 --> 00:15:00,337
also is within itself.

187
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:06,419
It’s such a storage

188
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:12,962
of wisdom, knowledge and love.

189
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:18,129
So it does not deviate.

190
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:22,878
Once you become a Sahaja Yogi, the concern

191
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:28,212
for your benevolence

192
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:31,670
is all the time there.

193
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:36,586
Whether you are punished or not is a different point.

194
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:40,254
Some people might get a job.

195
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,795
Some people will not get a job.

196
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:45,920
With some people it will work out this way.

197
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:49,045
With some people it will not work out that way.

198
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:51,503
Then one may say that, “How is it, this Paramachaitanya

199
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:53,503
is behaving like this?”

200
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:55,628
Is all for your correction.

201
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:58,545
Is a big churning.

202
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:01,129
Whatever works out for your correction

203
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:03,379
and is for your benevolence.

204
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,628
If you understand this point,

205
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:09,337
then you’ll never be disappointed in your life.

206
00:16:16,254 --> 00:16:19,628
And it has no concern

207
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:22,170
of its own benevolence,

208
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:26,337
because it is complete benevolence itself.

209
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:33,420
It never thinks how it is going to be benevolent

210
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:39,878
or helpful, because it has no botheration about it.

211
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:44,129
A man, say, who has everything,

212
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,129
worldly things,

213
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:49,003
still may be concerned about getting more,

214
00:16:49,212 --> 00:16:51,503
the greed, there would be.

215
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,420
But as it is the complete, Purna,

216
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:58,920
it has no greed.

217
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:04,045
It’s fully satisfied with itself.

218
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,878
And because it is so powerful,

219
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:10,837
so knowledgeable,

220
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:14,212
that it has no doubts,

221
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,379
no doubts of any kind.

222
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:20,920
And because

223
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,212
there’s nobody which can harm it,

224
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,503
it has no fear.

225
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:36,503
And you all have now felt

226
00:17:36,795 --> 00:17:40,878
that Paramachaitanya,

227
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:47,295
should give you a complete fearless life,

228
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:50,420
a peaceful life,

229
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:53,170
and a joyous life.

230
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,586
Like a child who finds his mother, then he stops crying,

231
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:02,837
no more, now he’s found his mother.

232
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:07,045
In the same way you have found Paramachaitanya

233
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:10,045
and the connection with it.

234
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:14,420
So you don’t have to worry for anything,

235
00:18:15,212 --> 00:18:17,003
don’t have to think about anything,

236
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:19,670
you don’t have to plan about anything,

237
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:22,295
only thing is you have to jump into it,

238
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:25,545
just jump into it

239
00:18:26,962 --> 00:18:32,170
and know that you have become part and parcel of the reality.

240
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:40,503
This if you have understood, I think, we have done a big job.

241
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:46,295
Now we are in Germany,

242
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:49,586
and you know in Germany

243
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,045
there have been people who have

244
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,419
tried to shatter the hopes of human beings.

245
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:02,003
But

246
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:05,962
even that happening that took place,

247
00:19:06,586 --> 00:19:10,628
all those horrible things happened, that so many people died,

248
00:19:10,837 --> 00:19:14,087
of course they are born again, no problem,

249
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:17,586
and such problems came up

250
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,503
that they were

251
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,254
thinking that

252
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:29,379
the whole world will be finished.

253
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,586
They were so much worried,

254
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:35,962
they thought that the whole world will be finished.

255
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,379
But did not.

256
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:43,753
But this war has taught us a lesson.

257
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:49,753
It has made us more collective.

258
00:19:50,337 --> 00:19:53,379
It has made us understand each other.

259
00:19:54,337 --> 00:19:57,628
Otherwise, how do you come out of the ignorance

260
00:19:57,837 --> 00:20:01,170
that “we are this country”, “we are that country”,

261
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:03,420
racialism,

262
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:06,337
then this so-called nationalism,

263
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:08,586
so-called patriotism -

264
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:13,254
all these separating forces,

265
00:20:14,795 --> 00:20:17,129
divisive things.

266
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:22,795
Saw clearly we are all human beings

267
00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:27,878
and we should be treated as human beings.

268
00:20:28,545 --> 00:20:32,254
If you see the history, after every war

269
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:38,670
there has been a speedy movement towards knowledge,

270
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:42,419
knowledge of oneness of the world.

271
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:45,962
It is something

272
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:51,379
like, you have in a spacecraft

273
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:55,419
that a container is built in,

274
00:20:57,212 --> 00:21:00,586
one into another,

275
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:06,170
and the whole thing

276
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:12,711
comes into a speed, some velocity,

277
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:17,837
and then the lower container bursts,

278
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:20,837
or explodes.

279
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:25,045
When it explodes, it gives a higher speed

280
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,379
to the rest of it.

281
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:33,920
And so the acceleration of the velocity takes place.

282
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,419
And that’s how one can go into the space.

283
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:42,837
In the same manner,

284
00:21:43,045 --> 00:21:46,545
all these horrible things that have happened

285
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:50,170
are explosions

286
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:54,003
which brings you

287
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:59,003
towards knowledge

288
00:21:59,254 --> 00:22:01,212
that there’s something wrong with us,

289
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:05,129
we are living with something unreal.

290
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:11,461
Now the problems, today’s problems as they are,

291
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,628
like ecology problem,

292
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,419
AIDS,

293
00:22:26,503 --> 00:22:28,337
drugs,

294
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:35,212
all these modern problems and poverty,

295
00:22:36,295 --> 00:22:39,586
if you see it like a witness, you will see

296
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:42,503
these are quite shocking.

297
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:46,045
These are very shocking things.

298
00:22:46,254 --> 00:22:50,753
And all these shocking things should really shock our mind,

299
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,461
should really shock our mind.

300
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:58,420
Why we have these problems?

301
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,129
And these problems, some of the stupid leaders think

302
00:23:05,337 --> 00:23:08,878
that we can solve by making more money.

303
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,170
We can protect ourselves from ecology if we have more money.

304
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:19,212
And that we can pollute the atmosphere

305
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,420
because we will have more money.

306
00:23:21,628 --> 00:23:24,212
And then we can protect ourselves

307
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,753
so that everybody will have to have a mask,

308
00:23:26,962 --> 00:23:29,503
moving about all over the place.

309
00:23:29,878 --> 00:23:34,295
But we should make more money to protect ourselves.

310
00:23:34,461 --> 00:23:38,295
Doesn’t matter if there is ecological problem, doesn’t matter.

311
00:23:39,254 --> 00:23:41,003
So you move about

312
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:43,795
like a person who is entering

313
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:47,962
into the area which is all full of fumes.

314
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:54,003
All these stupid ideas come up because

315
00:23:54,212 --> 00:23:55,962
they do not see

316
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,420
that, what is human dignity is,

317
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:04,586
that human beings are above

318
00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:08,753
everything else - above machinery,

319
00:24:08,962 --> 00:24:12,920
above all material things of the world.

320
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:17,795
They will not talk, that we'll balance the machinery. No.

321
00:24:18,628 --> 00:24:21,461
What they will talk, that we'll make a man

322
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,337
a greater slave of the machinery

323
00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:26,419
because he must have money.

324
00:24:26,586 --> 00:24:30,254
He must have more money, and with this more money,

325
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,545
we can protect ourselves against this ecological problem.

326
00:24:34,878 --> 00:24:37,337
It is absurd.

327
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:42,379
But if you understand the human dignity,

328
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:45,753
then you have to understand that

329
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:48,962
as a human being,

330
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:56,045
we have to take a very positive,

331
00:24:56,254 --> 00:25:00,670
wise step to stop all the nonsense we have been doing.

332
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,920
Like, now most of the

333
00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:10,670
French

334
00:25:12,337 --> 00:25:13,670
shores,

335
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:17,920
the beaches, are polluted.

336
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,420
Naturally.

337
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:22,586
Because they started a funny thing

338
00:25:22,795 --> 00:25:25,545
called “holiday making on the seashore.”

339
00:25:26,503 --> 00:25:28,295
So this is the result.

340
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:30,419
Now, do what you please.

341
00:25:30,586 --> 00:25:33,878
You cannot do all that. It has stopped.

342
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:36,419
So instead of - now human brain is such,

343
00:25:36,628 --> 00:25:39,962
instead of understanding that we have done something wrong,

344
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,420
oh, they will say, “We will start some new method

345
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:46,045
of cleansing this.”

346
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:48,795
They will never condemn

347
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:50,962
what has gone wrong with them

348
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:54,461
that they have become so addicted to this kind of a

349
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,254
funny life that they have on the seashores.

350
00:25:58,795 --> 00:26:00,670
Now, AIDS.

351
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:03,920
You’ll be amazed that in America

352
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:07,670
why, even they said that

353
00:26:07,962 --> 00:26:11,503
there were in Los Angeles, itself,

354
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:15,129
seven hundred thousand people

355
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:19,212
who glorified themselves as martyrs of AIDS

356
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:23,254
because they are achieving such a great goal

357
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,628
of leading a life which is nonsensical,

358
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,129
as if like a big revolution.

359
00:26:33,212 --> 00:26:37,003
And thinking that they are very, very

360
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:40,586
great revolutionaries, great people,

361
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:44,295
that they are supporting this AIDS

362
00:26:47,254 --> 00:26:51,628
disease and glorifying it.

363
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,295
Can you believe

364
00:26:55,586 --> 00:26:59,795
that this kind of

365
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:03,920
assertion will be accepted?

366
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:08,170
People will laugh at you.

367
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:12,045
But everything is so money-oriented.

368
00:27:12,254 --> 00:27:14,087
They like to advertise it.

369
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:16,628
They want to talk about money help.

370
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:19,878
They want to say that this is happening because

371
00:27:21,711 --> 00:27:23,420
if they had more money,

372
00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:27,003
they would have taken more drugs.

373
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,419
Because they have no money, that’s why they are thieving.

374
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:34,087
So we must give them money so that they can take drugs,

375
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:38,212
or they can take to this kind of life.

376
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:40,962
On the whole, if you see,

377
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,212
people have lived

378
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:46,170
with something which is so unreal

379
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:49,379
all their lives, absolutely unreal.

380
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:53,170
And when it comes to facing it,

381
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:55,753
that we’ve done a mistake,

382
00:27:55,962 --> 00:27:58,920
we should not have done this mistake;

383
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:01,837
then they retreat

384
00:28:02,045 --> 00:28:05,129
and take another glorious

385
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:08,503
image, artificial and unreal,

386
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:12,170
saying  “Oh, we are great, we are martyrs.”

387
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:22,003
And this is what is, what we call is Kali Yuga

388
00:28:22,212 --> 00:28:27,087
where everything that is ignoble, everything that is to be detested,

389
00:28:27,295 --> 00:28:31,461
everything from which we should have protection will become

390
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:36,212
the goal of people to achieve.

391
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,795
I hope you have understood

392
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:44,379
that the All-Pervading Power around us

393
00:28:44,545 --> 00:28:47,254
is the one that is doing Sahaja Yoga,

394
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,795
is the one that has brought you to Sahaja Yoga,

395
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:53,419
and is the one who has given you blessings,

396
00:28:53,586 --> 00:28:54,878
is Paramachaitanya.

397
00:28:57,045 --> 00:28:59,795
Through which it has worked out.

398
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:04,545
So today’s prayer should be that we be more and more aware

399
00:29:04,753 --> 00:29:08,795
that we are part and parcel of that Paramachaitanya

400
00:29:09,003 --> 00:29:11,461
and that we can feel that,

401
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,753
we can use that power, we can work it out.

402
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,711
If it is felt today that way,

403
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,337
I think lot of work has been done already

404
00:29:22,503 --> 00:29:24,337
and may God bless you for that.

405
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,003
Now.

406
00:30:42,628 --> 00:30:46,379
So when you are doing this Puja, please remember

407
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:49,878
that you are worshipping Me as Paramachaitanya

408
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:54,254
and so you have to just think

409
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,212
that you’re dealing with reality itself.

410
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:06,003
With that understanding, you have to do this Puja.

411
00:31:13,212 --> 00:31:15,503
May God bless you.
