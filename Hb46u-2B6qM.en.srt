1
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,761
This will be the fifth puja in Australia,

2
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:40,459
and I thought that this is the land of Ganesha,

3
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,202
we should have the Ganesha Puja. Is very important
also, very helpful.

4
00:01:45,347 --> 00:01:48,249
We all should have Ganesha Puja,
 it’s very important.

5
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:53,019
And so today
there will be Shri Ganesha Puja.

6
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:54,002
Have you

7
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:56,683
got the hundred and eight
names of Shri Ganesha?

8
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:43,187
So we have now requested John Fisher to be
your leader in Canberra. And he has agreed.

9
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:51,494
I don’t know what to tell you more about
Shri Ganesh, because really it is so important

10
00:03:51,494 --> 00:04:00,409
that we have to know the importance of Mooladhara
Chakra.

11
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:17,266
If you read the newspaper, just on the first
page you find people going amok as far as

12
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:22,594
their moral sense is concerned, absolutely
I mean, to us it is something so shocking,

13
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:31,896
and perhaps I think people are possessed on
their Mooladhara Chakra.

14
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:39,813
The way they behave one feels that there’s
something gone wrong with them completely

15
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:48,337
and they have no control over themselves;
and just like mad people they are behaving.

16
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:54,617
And all these problems that are coming, of
these perversions, are due to this kind of

17
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:58,807
a possession on the Mooladhara Chakra.

18
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:05,047
One has to be very, very careful and respectful
about it.

19
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:10,637
I have already told so many things how to
keep it clean, how to respect it and how to

20
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:16,047
behave yourself.

21
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:28,047
As you know, Shri Ganesha was created
at the gate of hell to protect us from falling

22
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:30,427
into hell.

23
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:42,157
But actually when we insult Him and we do
not care for Him, He just sleeps off.

24
00:05:42,157 --> 00:05:53,327
When that happens, any kind of a possession
can come and can really make people mad.

25
00:05:53,327 --> 00:06:02,667
When you come from India to these places you
are really surprised and shocked.

26
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:08,667
What is wrong with these people, how can they
be behaving in this manner?

27
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:14,866
How can they go all out to ruin themselves
like this?

28
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:22,337
And how is it they do not understand the importance
of morality when they are following Christ?

29
00:06:22,337 --> 00:06:29,307
The Christians, I think, are the worst as
far as morality is concerned.

30
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:31,737
They have no moral values left in them.

31
00:06:31,737 --> 00:06:39,866
It’s such a sad thing that the number of
people killed by Christians is also the maximum.

32
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:47,237
Sometimes I think these people who were killed
everywhere might have possessed the Christians

33
00:06:47,237 --> 00:06:54,506
this way, that they are just going amok and
behaving in this manner, destroying themselves.

34
00:06:54,506 --> 00:07:03,837
Now the first quality of Shri Ganesha is that
He gives us wisdom.

35
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:11,006
And that wisdom gives us the sense how to
behave, gives us the balance, and gives us

36
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:22,087
the sense how to behave towards ourselves,
how to preserve yourself, how to respect yourself.

37
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:33,957
But if Ganesha is not at all there to watch
you, might be from hell some horrible hellish

38
00:07:33,957 --> 00:07:38,597
bhoots are coming out, or I don’t know,
I cannot explain this kind of a thing.

39
00:07:38,597 --> 00:07:45,177
But the other way round, I’ll tell you,
in India, is specially with women, they are

40
00:07:45,177 --> 00:07:52,676
extremely particular about their chastity,
extremely particular.

41
00:07:52,676 --> 00:08:00,577
Like we had a queen called Padmini, and she
was a very beautiful woman.

42
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:06,957
And one Muslim aggressor who became sultan
heard about her beauty.

43
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:11,137
So he wanted to see her.

44
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:14,817
So she refused, “I don’t want to see him.”

45
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:24,856
Even seeing a woman like that: those bad eyes,
are bad; seeing a woman also, are bad.

46
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:31,197
So he said, “If you do not allow me to see
her, I’ll invade your country.”

47
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:37,276
So she agreed that, “All right, he can see
me in a mirror, so at least his bad eyes don’t

48
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:38,847
fall on me directly.”

49
00:08:38,847 --> 00:08:39,947
She agreed to that.

50
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:48,746
And he saw her in a mirror, and he saw that
it was even more beautiful than he had thought

51
00:08:48,746 --> 00:08:49,907
her to be.

52
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:52,146
So now he wanted to have her.

53
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:56,207
So physical, so superficial.

54
00:08:56,207 --> 00:09:02,686
And he said, “If you now do not come to
me, I will again attack.”

55
00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:09,327
So they made a plan, “Let us now decide
whether we are going to surrender our queen

56
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:10,327
or not.”

57
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:11,327
So everybody said, “Nothing doing.

58
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:13,037
We are not going to surrender.”

59
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:23,197
Because the chastity of a woman is very important,
and that of a queen, and a queen, who is representative

60
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:28,116
of all the womanhood should not be sacrificed
like this.

61
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:31,026
They could not bear the idea.

62
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:38,176
So they said that, “All right, we’ll organize
something and cheat these people.”

63
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:42,706
So they sent a word, “All right, we are
all coming and the queen is coming too.”

64
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:44,426
And they sent hundred palanquins.

65
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:49,007
We use palanquins for ladies in India, covered.

66
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:55,116
And inside every palanquin there was one warrior
sitting with all the weapons.

67
00:09:55,116 --> 00:10:00,377
And there were four carrying the palanquin,
and all these four were also warriors.

68
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:04,676
So thus they have about five hundred warriors.

69
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:08,727
It was a small kingdom.

70
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:13,067
So when they went down, these people were
very happy.

71
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:14,067
“The queen is coming.”

72
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:18,567
and they were all getting drunk and celebrating
it.

73
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:19,956
“The queen is coming.

74
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:20,956
Queen is coming.”

75
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:22,576
So they were half drunk also.

76
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:28,886
They had told these women that, “In case
we win, then we lit a fire and you will know

77
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:30,987
that we have won.

78
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:38,186
But if you do not see any thing like that,
then be sure that we have lost the war.”

79
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:43,627
So the king sat in the front palanquin, and
the rest of them, and they went and attacked

80
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:48,696
them in the sense that they first entered
inside, and then instead of the queen, the

81
00:10:48,696 --> 00:10:52,296
king came out and they all fought those people.

82
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:57,377
But they were only five hundred so they could
not be saved, and these people had better

83
00:10:57,377 --> 00:11:00,317
weapons, so they were killed.

84
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:02,847
They did not lit the fire.

85
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:05,106
Now the women knew that all of them will be
coming.

86
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:10,696
Now they were very rich sultans, very rich
Muslims, and things like that.

87
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:17,436
But they thought that now their chastity is
in danger, so there was a big platform and

88
00:11:17,436 --> 00:11:19,046
they made a big pyre on that.

89
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:29,676
And they all entered into it and killed themselves,
before they could enter and touch their body.

90
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:37,146
So for women specially it is very important
to have a great sense of chastity.

91
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:43,276
And if they do not have the great sense of
chastity, then they develop all kinds of funny

92
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:48,486
ideas and mentally they become very imbalanced.

93
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:54,627
And the children that they have, also become
very funny and you have all these problems

94
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:58,336
of perverted relations, incest relations.

95
00:11:58,336 --> 00:12:05,097
And today I read a horrible story about a
little girl who suffered with this incest

96
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:07,557
relationship.

97
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:14,667
It’s hell that we have created.

98
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,694
In hell what else is going to be?

99
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:21,873
Same thing.

100
00:12:21,944 --> 00:12:26,647
There’s no sanity about it, there’s no
wisdom about it.

101
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:35,727
So we have to now understand how we have to
build ourselves as Sahaja yogis.

102
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:42,386
Men and women, all of them, have to go hand
in hand, because the first quality I told

103
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:48,380
is wisdom, but the essence of Mooladhara is
innocence.

104
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:51,643
They are made of innocence.

105
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:54,967
The power of Ganesha is innocence.

106
00:12:54,967 --> 00:13:00,946
And innocence comes when you do not destroy
it.

107
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:07,047
Actually a child is born innocent, but if
the mother is like that, immediately the child

108
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:13,136
takes over and if the father is like that
the son takes over.

109
00:13:13,136 --> 00:13:17,667
But later on it has effect, whether it’s
mother or father.

110
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:22,896
The whole society is decadent, is in decadence,
is going down.

111
00:13:22,896 --> 00:13:25,307
You can see it so clearly.

112
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:35,587
Thanks to certain great saints in India who
made the culture of India, it has not come

113
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:42,886
from any philosophers or any writers or intellectuals,
but it has come to us from the saints who

114
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:51,766
understood the value of chastity, and who
understood the value of innocence.

115
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:57,357
And they have built the whole thing in such
a manner that these things never enter into

116
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:58,357
our head.

117
00:13:58,357 --> 00:14:03,227
So we call them as susamskaras, means “good
conditionings”.

118
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:08,527
These good conditionings are surrounding us
so much that this never enters into our head,

119
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:12,837
all these kind of things that people are doing
here, are mad.

120
00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:24,797
When it doesn’t enter into your head, we
can say that we just do not allow these possessions

121
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,646
to come in.

122
00:14:27,646 --> 00:14:34,636
Because if you make preparation in a way for
these possessions to come in, then the possessions

123
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:35,696
will be there.

124
00:14:35,696 --> 00:14:41,706
Like the way people dress up nowadays, you
see, they look like really witches or bhoots,

125
00:14:41,706 --> 00:14:42,807
absolutely.

126
00:14:42,807 --> 00:14:47,886
And such people will be definitely attacked,
because the bhoots think that, “These are

127
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:48,897
someone like us.

128
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:51,037
Let’s go enter them.”

129
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:52,797
Also Agnya is not to be covered.

130
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:56,920
I have told a hundred times, please don’t
cover your Agnya, please clear it down.

131
00:14:57,288 --> 00:14:59,059
Don’t cover your Agnya.

132
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:03,829
If you cover your Agnya, then you cannot be
protected.

133
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:10,752
They enter into your Agnya and from Agnya
they can go up to your Mooladhara.

134
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:17,737
So you are living in atmosphere which is very
dangerous for saints to live.

135
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:21,387
Actually that’s why they said the saints
must go to Himalaya.

136
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:28,417
If they could say that to Indians, I don’t
know what should I say to people who live

137
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:32,843
in such horrible circumstance, absolutely
horrible.

138
00:15:32,868 --> 00:15:40,839
I mean, you think about it, how terrible it
is, and how many problems it gives us; how

139
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:47,339
many people are ruined, how many children
are ruined, how we go amok.

140
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:56,420
So the first thing is that we should understand
that Ganesha gives us maryadas, limits, it

141
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,610
is innate within us.

142
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,230
It’s not imposed on us, it is innate.

143
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:09,699
A little girl if you see, she’s shy, she
knows how to protect herself.

144
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:19,860
Even the boys, they are shy and they try to
protect themselves, but that innate innocence

145
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,370
we try to flout, because ego is there.

146
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,569
“What’s wrong?”

147
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:30,170
You tell them anything, “What’s wrong?”

148
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:35,129
And you do not know how devastating it is.

149
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:41,329
In London I know of so many parents telling
Me that their children are already squatting,

150
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:44,069
they have got already children.

151
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:47,363
At a very young age, about fifteen, sixteen
they

152
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:48,388
have got children.

153
00:16:54,928 --> 00:17:00,050
And this is so widespread, and so shamelessly
they discuss.

154
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,389
I mean, in the newspaper if you read, I mean
you can’t imagine why to write all these

155
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:06,740
things in such details in the newspaper.

156
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:12,540
There’s no need to write each and every
thing in the newspaper.

157
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,930
But basically we are good people.

158
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,680
God has created us good human beings.

159
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:35,829
We are beautiful people, but this ego and
this kind of a stupid idea that, “What’s

160
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:41,959
wrong?” in doing anything, coming from ego;
people have gone amok, and when you go amok

161
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:47,249
you get caught up by these bhoots, and then
once you are caught up by these bhoots, you

162
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:51,329
start behaving in a manner that no one can
explain.

163
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:53,870
“Why they behave like this?”

164
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,050
I just don’t understand.

165
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:04,360
There was a boy who came with all his hair
not properly done and looking funny and with

166
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,070
all these jattas, as we call them.

167
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,760
So I asked him, “Why do you dress up like
this?

168
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,709
You look like a primitive man.”

169
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:13,009
He said, “I want to be primitive.”

170
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,959
I said, “You cannot.

171
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,610
Your brain is modern.

172
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,399
By just making such hair, are you going to
become primitive?

173
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,019
You cannot become primitive.”

174
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:27,000
But just imagine, all these external things
they do.

175
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,050
For what?

176
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,680
To have an identity.

177
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:38,060
Now this idea of identity is also is a sign
that you do not have your maryadas.

178
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,060
You can do anything.

179
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,300
You can become a punk and all kinds of things
you do.

180
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,060
I mean, there are no maryadas.

181
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,180
And that means you are denying Ganesha completely.

182
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:56,130
Ganesha has created those maryadas innately
within us.

183
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,300
Even a prostitute in India, if she has to
take to that profession because she’s forced

184
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:07,180
into it, maybe she’s been brought from somewhere
or maybe that out of her big problems she

185
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,470
might have been a prostitute; she will see
that her child is saved.

186
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,889
She knows that it’s wrong.

187
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:18,199
But here it is so bad that we do not know
also that it is wrong.

188
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:24,160
Can you imagine, this is the limit of things,
that you see yourself getting drowned in the

189
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,279
water and you know that you are going to be
killed.

190
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,939
Still you are enjoying, “Very nice, I am
going to be killed.”

191
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:33,749
This is the situation of the wisdom.

192
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:36,649
This is really shocking.

193
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:41,950
So we have to now understand what are our
maryadas are, how we have to live within our

194
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:47,899
maryadas, and I’m sure if you really work
out your Shri Ganesha.

195
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:51,269
For that the best is to meditate.

196
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:58,819
Put yourself on some nice turf, grass.

197
00:19:58,819 --> 00:19:59,819
Sit on that.

198
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:07,589
Put your left hand with the light, and right
hand on the Mother Earth, and say Atharva

199
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:08,660
Sheersha.

200
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,249
If you can remember it by heart, it’s a
very good thing.

201
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:17,360
Otherwise, you can keep the book and read
it, or say Ganesha’s mantra to begin with.

202
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,559
It’s going to help you very much.

203
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:24,589
It’s going to help you, your eyes, it’s
going to your whole thing, is going to be

204
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:26,559
very nice.

205
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:34,220
And also with this kind of a mad Mooladhara,
a woman can become extremely aggressive with

206
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
her husband.

207
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,150
I mean, she can be a very cruel woman, and
that’s what is happening in America now.

208
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,630
But I can’t understand how women could be
that cruel.

209
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,520
I mean, I never used to think women could
be cruel, really.

210
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:57,310
I mean they could be sly, they could be sort
of, doing some scandal-mongering or some sort

211
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,460
of stupid things like that.

212
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:06,410
But that a woman should be a cruel woman…
when I first read the history of England I

213
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:12,180
was surprised that there were some queens
who were very cruel, and also that there were

214
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,510
seven queens who were killed.

215
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:23,153
In India if a king kills even one queen, he’ll
be ousted completely from the whole country.

216
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,755
So it’s not a

217
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,660
something very simple thing.

218
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,350
It’s very serious.

219
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:29,470
For Sahaja yogis very, very serious.

220
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:36,220
They have to revive their innocence.

221
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,530
They have to revive their maryadas.

222
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,580
They have to delimit themselves.

223
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,120
It’s very important.

224
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:53,170
Otherwise, I would say that, if you have some
wheat spread out everywhere, how can you reach

225
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,680
the heights?

226
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,340
You have to put them into some bags, some
maryadas.

227
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:04,340
Only by maryadas you can rise.

228
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,850
Of course the kundalini will help.

229
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,270
Of course Ganesha will help also.

230
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:13,470
But we should also try to watch ourselves.

231
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,670
There should be introspection, “Are we still
in the same category?”

232
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:27,990
I have told many people that it is better
you walk with your eyes towards the grass,

233
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:33,230
at only at three feet, because at three feet
you can only see children, flowers and grounds,

234
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,790
not higher than that.

235
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,460
Nothing very beautiful is beyond that I think.

236
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:48,779
Or raise much higher, so that you just see
above the heads of people, nothing in between.

237
00:23:48,804 --> 00:24:00,096
And our whole style, lifestyle is so funny;
I mean, I just don’t know how to explain

238
00:24:00,121 --> 00:24:03,370
it, but is accepted.

239
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:10,800
Yesterday there was an Indian, and very seriously
he came and told Me, “I have been committing

240
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,880
one sin, so I must tell you.”

241
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
I said, “What?”

242
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,800
“In my family nobody takes beer, but I am
taking beer sometimes.”

243
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:26,709
After that, I didn’t know where to look
and what to say.

244
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:32,940
Very seriously he said, “You are Mother,
so I must confess to You, but now I will never

245
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,001
touch beer.”

246
00:24:34,026 --> 00:24:35,510
Imagine.

247
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:41,590
Very seriously he was talking, and another
fellow came, he has told Me.

248
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:45,360
I said, “Now you Indians don’t want to
come to this thing.

249
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
What is it?

250
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,570
You are all making money?”

251
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:52,060
He said, “We have made a lot of money here
and we don’t want any money.”

252
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,190
But I said, “Then why don’t you come?

253
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,100
You should come and take your, to Sahaja Yoga.

254
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,100
Why not?”

255
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,230
He said, “You see, Mother, mostly the trouble
is…”

256
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:06,420
With very great hesitation, he said that,
“You see, mostly it is not advertised in

257
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:11,800
Indian papers, and we Indians think that we
are rather of a different species, you see,

258
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,970
how are we going to fit in with these people
because, you see, their ideas are so different,

259
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:21,270
ours are so different, and how are we going
to fit in with them?

260
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,300
It’s very difficult.

261
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,150
But this time I saw some Indians also and
some Indian musicians singing, so it seems

262
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,830
that we can fit into them.”

263
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,310
“Yes,” I said, “They can fit in to you
and you can fit in to them.

264
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,310
It’s easy.

265
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,310
They are your style only.”

266
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:41,100
He said, “We were really enamored how they
were nice, you see, and they were.”

267
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,360
Because they do not consider that these things
are bad or anything.

268
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,760
India is like that, you see.

269
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,490
They think you are of a different bottle and
they are of a different bottle.

270
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,670
So you are like that and they are like that.

271
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,860
They cannot be like you and you cannot be
like them, so they think it is a different

272
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,480
bottle you belong to, you see, different category
of people.

273
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,630
But they don’t think that you are bad or
good, they don’t pass judgment.

274
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:13,010
But this is what it is, that we have to understand
that we have gone too far with this madness,

275
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,580
spoiling our Shri Ganesha.

276
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:24,740
Also Australians have to give a very big lead
in Shri Ganesha’s area because you are sitting

277
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,130
on the soil of Shri Ganesha.

278
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,830
To all the Sahaja yogis, you must show.

279
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:38,630
But, as you know what, we had horrible experiences
so far, and how people have been dominating

280
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:48,780
and doing all kinds of nonsensical things,
money-wise and otherwise also morality-wise.

281
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:57,700
So it sometimes upsets the whole balance of
Sahaja Yoga because it’s all depending on

282
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:04,020
Shri Ganesha; that means depending on Australians.

283
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:12,280
And Australians have all the possibility of
reaching a great height in Ganesh principle,

284
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,030
because they have the Mother Earth here sitting
down.

285
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,120
What else do they want?

286
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,720
You need not take to stupid American-style
things.

287
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,260
I mean, if you see their Hallowe’en, I tell
you, you won’t eat your food for eight days.

288
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:34,850
And if you go only to Rio, even you do not
visit their carnivals, but even if you see

289
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:39,950
the pictures, you won’t eat your food for
one month, so horrible they are.

290
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:50,190
So are we going to follow them, or are we
going to start our own Australian Shri Ganesha’s

291
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,730
special people?

292
00:27:52,730 --> 00:28:04,640
Or, this I have to warn you, and people are
all watching all over, all Sahaja yogis are

293
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,040
there; you know that all over the world we
have Sahaja yogis.

294
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:15,270
They’re watching everyone, and you have
to do your maximum to express your Ganesh

295
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:20,400
principle, which should be very easy for you.

296
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,070
And as I have told you, that Australia was
a part and parcel of India once upon a time.

297
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,620
It has come down here.

298
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:33,320
So, at least in your films and all that, you
can say they’re dharmic, they are dharmic.

299
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:41,830
They’re not so bad as the American films
are, but still this idea of copying the French

300
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:46,240
or the Americans shows that we have lost our
personality.

301
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,290
But Shri Ganesha gives you a personality.

302
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,090
He gives you your personality, because He
gives you maryadas.

303
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,170
You see, by maryadas only, you get your personality.

304
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,200
A person is known by his maryadas.

305
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,660
And that’s what has to come within us, are
our maryadas.

306
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,700
So today’s puja is about Shri Ganesha.

307
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:13,110
As of course you know, He has got four petals
and you know what He is placed in and what

308
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:18,240
He does and all that, and how He looks after
the chastity of His Mother and all that.

309
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:25,120
But the main thing is that how we develop
Shri Ganesha within us, how people see us

310
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,570
as the incarnations of innocence on this Earth.

311
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:38,740
I know it’s very difficult, but imagine
Shri Ganesha sitting on the gate of hell,

312
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:45,770
of excretion, because He’s just like a lotus,
above everything else, and He makes everything

313
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,810
fragrant.

314
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:53,740
In the same way I expect all of you, the Sahaja
yogis of Australia, to have that beautiful

315
00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:03,790
personality of Shri Ganesha, and that you
emit that fragrance of innocence among all

316
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,760
the Sahaja yogis, and then among all the world.

317
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,968
May God bless you.
