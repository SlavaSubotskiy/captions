1
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,420
Today we have gathered here

2
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,470
to worship Shri Krishna,

3
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,550
the one who was Virat,

4
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,220
who fought all kinds of evil

5
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,420
without entering into the arena.

6
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,630
Shri Krishna’s life,

7
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,550
it’s sense of is very ... a beautiful,

8
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:36,300
creative and loving thing;

9
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,380
but to understand Him, it is not easy.

10
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,260
For example, in Kurukshetra,

11
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,220
where the war was going on

12
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,590
and Arjuna became depressed

13
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,510
and he said that

14
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,800
“Why should we fight, fight our own kith and kin,

15
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,880
fight our own close relations,

16
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,630
friends and our gurus?

17
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,760
Is it religion? Is it dharma?”

18
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,550
Before that, in Gita,

19
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,880
Shri Krishna has described a personality

20
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,920
which is a sage.

21
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,920
We can call him a saint. Or He called it a sityapragya.

22
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:49,340
So when asked what is the definition of the sityapragya,

23
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,260
the description He gave was

24
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,840
about a person  who is absolutely at peace with himself

25
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,550
and at peace with his atmosphere.

26
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,260
Is very surprising.

27
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,760
All this knowledge He gave in the

28
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,380
first place in Gita.

29
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,800
That is — that is the best,

30
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,840
that He called as the Gnyanamarga.

31
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,380
That is Sahaj Yoga, by which you get the subtle knowledge.

32
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,720
But at the same time, when you see Him advising Arjuna,

33
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:44,300
it is very surprising that here he’s talking only of spirituality,

34
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,880
of complete detachment

35
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,380
and there He’s telling Arjuna  that “You go and fight.

36
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,220
They are already dead people.

37
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,760
Whom are you fighting?”

38
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:08,340
This conflict is difficult to understand,

39
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,760
that how could Shri Krishna, the same person

40
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,670
who is preaching that ‘you all have to become sityapragya’,

41
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,630
suddenly starts telling Arjuna

42
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,630
that ‘you go and fight the force’.

43
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,630
One side it is complete detachment

44
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,920
and another side is the war.

45
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,550
How will you explain this?

46
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,510
Is Shri Krishna’s

47
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,380
own words, one can say

48
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,220
that “Once you are

49
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,920
a Realised Soul

50
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,550
and you have reached that highest position

51
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,760
in your awareness,

52
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,340
to you everything is futile.

53
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,550
But just now, what you have to do

54
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,880
is to save the dharma

55
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,420
— not the dharma that people talk about.

56
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,300
But the dharma  means evolutionary process of human beings,

57
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,550
which is going on and if all the good people,

58
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,470
those who stand for righteousness, are finished,

59
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,840
then how will this evolutionary

60
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,800
power will be saved?

61
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,380
So you have to save them and for that, if you have to kill,

62
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,510
you don’t kill anybody, they’re already dead

63
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,880
because they’re not evolved souls

64
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,920
and they don’t care for their Realisation.

65
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,420
So you have to fight them. You have to fight the negative forces.

66
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,420
You have to fight the wrongdoers”.

67
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,220
All this He explains

68
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,920
in a very beautiful manner,

69
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,760
that we have within us

70
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,260
three kinds of powers, which we also know,

71
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,760
and by the middle one that we have,

72
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:50,550
we rise above all these material,

73
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,670
physical, mental, emotional

74
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,920
— all these problems facing us

75
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,880
into a new realm of spirituality.

76
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,510
And that’s what He wanted – to save

77
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,630
from the cruel people, from the aggressive,

78
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,880
who were also misleading others.

79
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,340
It’s a very good understanding,

80
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,720
if you have, that who is your relation,

81
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,800
who is your brother, who is your sister?

82
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Those who are evolved souls are your relations.

83
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,590
They are your own

84
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,630
and, for them, if you have to fight the people

85
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,510
who are aggressive people, you better do it.

86
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,300
You have to do it. That is the way of dharma.

87
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:02,670
So we have three paths, as you know, in Sahaja Yoga.

88
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,340
The one is of bhakti.

89
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,380
Bhakti is where you sing the praise of God,

90
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,920
have devotion, do all kinds of rituals, everything

91
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,340
and you think that you are very close to God.

92
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,260
This is one which is being accepted

93
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,800
by many, many people and by many so-called religions,

94
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,920
that we must have complete dedication for God.

95
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,920
How did — you are not yet connected to God.

96
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:47,920
How, what are you doing? How can you have any dedication to God,

97
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,840
with whom you are not at all connected?

98
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,800
The second one was the karma,

99
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,920
that you do your work.

100
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,920
You go on doing your work

101
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,720
with a detached mind. I mean it’s not possible,

102
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,720
but that’s what they say and we are doing our karmas,

103
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,300
good karmas, we do all kinds of good things,

104
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,760
go to various places for our cleansing,

105
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,260
meet many great people of spirituality,

106
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:36,550
go to all various places and pray.

107
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,720
Visit all auspicious places which are being described.

108
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,300
All kinds of rituals, we do for that.

109
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,340
That is the karma yoga.

110
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,800
And that is what the karma yoga, according to us, is the right side.

111
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,800
Many people, as you know, are right-sided.

112
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,920
Right-sided people are the people who are, as you know,

113
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,340
full of ego, arrogance

114
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,840
and think  no end of themselves, very difficult to correct them.

115
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,340
They also never see anything wrong with them.

116
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,470
Whichever way they act, they think is all right.

117
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,760
That is the karma yoga,

118
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,260
but He has said that

119
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,800
whatever karmas you do,

120
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,880
whatever its fruits are, that you cannot say.

121
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,260
He said it in a very uncertain manner

122
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,760
because definitely, if He had said it with certainty,

123
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,300
people would never have understood Him.

124
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,630
So He said it is not possible that whatever karmas you are doing

125
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,590
could be the karmas

126
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,840
which will get you the blessings of the Divine....

127
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,760
(MARATHI)... He has said it.

128
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,720
So then, which karmas we should do?

129
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,800
Or should we give up all the karmas?

130
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,670
All the action, we should give up?

131
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,800
People were in two minds.

132
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,340
This is the style of Shri Krishna, is to put people in two minds

133
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,260
so they use their discretion.

134
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:45,670
And third one is the discretion, which He calls as the Gnyanamarg,

135
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,720
is the central path, by which you evolve.

136
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,880
You evolve into a new state,

137
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,880
into a new state of your mind, a new state of your being,

138
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:04,510
by which you become

139
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,880
absolutely above every nonsense.

140
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,510
Also you are endowed with power to fight whatever is bad,

141
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,260
whatever is corrupting, whatever is killing this one.

142
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:32,510
At that stage, you are equipped with a  divine power

143
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:38,260
that you can finish off anything that is negative around you.

144
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,220
This is to be understood that that’s a state.

145
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,920
That’s not just talking. That’s not just believing that I am that,

146
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:58,880
but it’s a state. If you come up to that state

147
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,260
where you are beyond all these things

148
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,380
and you have all the knowledge, pure knowledge,

149
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:11,800
the subtle knowledge of being, this is the Gnyanamarg.

150
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,510
Many people say that

151
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,300
everybody cannot go to Gnyanamarg and, for that, you have to have a

152
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,840
special type of personality,

153
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,550
but this is very misleading.

154
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,510
Everyone can go into Gyanamarg.

155
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,630
It is very, very innately built within us,

156
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,470
this evolutionary attention, attainment.

157
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,590
It is within us and all of us can have that.

158
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:50,760
Only thing is we have no confidence perhaps

159
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,420
that we go on avoiding it

160
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,630
and go to cheaper things like becoming devoted to something,

161
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,340
doing some sort of a ritual, going to some sort of a holy place,

162
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:11,630
all kinds of nonsense, which doesn’t give you the evolutionary

163
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:19,880
ascent by which you know the knowledge,

164
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,800
the pure  knowledge, the real  knowledge.

165
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,840
So far, whatever you have known was written in the book,

166
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,630
whatever your parents told you,

167
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,800
or whatever you have explored outside.

168
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,630
But the knowledge which is the purest,

169
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,630
which is the real knowledge,

170
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,470
which is the gnyana, that you can only get through your ascent

171
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,300
and establish in yourself properly in that state.

172
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,260
If you go on denying it, you cannot make out.

173
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:07,420
But everyone has right to get it. You need not be educated,

174
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,300
you need not be a very simple person,

175
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,300
you need not be very rich or poor,

176
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,550
makes no difference,  as long as you are a human being

177
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,220
and a humble human being,

178
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,300
thinking that you have to achieve that state.

179
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,670
You all can get that state, which you know very well.

180
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,920
And at that state you become absolutely knowledgeable,

181
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,840
knowledgeable about yourself, knowledgeable about others,

182
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,840
knowledgeable about everything that goes around.

183
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,720
But this state must be maintained and try to go above that state

184
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,880
where you have no more doubts left in you.

185
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,470
This is what Shri Krishna taught

186
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,840
and this is what one has to achieve,

187
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,300
but He, being a diplomat, He tried to

188
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:13,510
tell you other stories. “Try this, try that, this, that.”

189
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,420
But actually what He has praised is gnyanamarg.

190
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,720
Ours is a gnyanamarg. That is the knowledge,

191
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,510
the path of knowledge in which you have to know all the knowledge.

192
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,880
Unless and until you have the whole knowledge,

193
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,260
you are not yet a gnyani, a person who knows.

194
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,760
In this way, He has established that our evolutionary process

195
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:53,920
has to come beyond all other human awareness.

196
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,760
Other human awareness

197
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,840
is of a no value for a special  personality.

198
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,720
Now he knows something, say, ‘how many miles it is

199
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,720
from here say to New York or what trains go there’.

200
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,800
All this knowledge is not real

201
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,470
— ‘how much this cloth will cost, how much this carpet will cost,

202
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,380
in what shop you can get. All this knowledge

203
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,220
is just useless, is not the real knowledge.

204
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,470
Such a person doesn’t know this kind of knowledge,

205
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,880
but what he knows is the knowledge about your being,

206
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,420
knowledge about the whole universe,

207
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,420
which is not how many stars there are

208
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,720
or how many universes there are. No

209
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,920
it is the subtle inner

210
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,760
personality of everything, he knows.

211
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,550
In that subtlety, he discovers  so many new things

212
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,380
which he may not even heard about,

213
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:22,550
and, thus you reach a state of great knowledgeable personality.

214
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,840
This is what we have to achieve. We are born as human beings

215
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,340
and we know so many things already.

216
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,300
People know so many things, but they don’t know the actual.

217
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,670
This knowledge doesn’t come

218
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,220
through your reading or through your

219
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,380
intellectual pursuit or for your emotional movement — no.

220
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:56,260
It is shaswat.  It is all the time there.

221
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,880
It exists. It will exist.

222
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:06,340
And it is just to be understood, just to be

223
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,800
known to yourself what it is.

224
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,260
It cannot change. It cannot be remoulded.

225
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,260
It is what it is.

226
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,840
And that is what you know now.

227
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,420
Nobody would doubt that

228
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,510
because those who have got this state, they may doubt,

229
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,880
they may call you crazy, they may think anything,

230
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,840
but with the open eyes, whatever you say (is) the truth.

231
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,800
In the same way, with the open heart and a open brain, when you

232
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,840
know that, that is the real truth

233
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,380
and that is what is to be known.

234
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,800
For that, according to Shri Krishna,

235
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:04,420
you have to go through various tests.

236
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,720
One is you go on praying to Him.

237
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,920
He says, “You go on praying to Me

238
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,300
and if you give Me flowers I’ll take. If you give Me water I’ll take

239
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,510
Whatever you’ll give Me, I’ll take.”

240
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:28,420
He says clearly, but

241
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:37,380
what will you make out of that is very important.

242
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,720
He doesn’t say,

243
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,220
“If you give Me something, I’ll give you something.” That 's it.

244
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,840
So what should be the state?

245
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,590
What should be the condition? He said,

246
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,880
“If you praise Me, if you do bhakti for Me,

247
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,630
you are giving Me presents, you are doing all sorts of things,

248
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,670
you are very dedicated, but

249
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:12,220
you should do ananyabhakti. Word is ananya.

250
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,590
Ananya means when there is not the other,

251
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,470
when we are one, when we are connected,

252
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,260
then the bhakti you do that time,

253
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,340
whatever music you have of devotion,

254
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,670
whatever flowers you give,

255
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,590
whatever expression you have,

256
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,840
it should be ananya”.

257
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,260
That’s the word He said, that “Do ananya bhakti....

258
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,340
(MARATHI) ...whatever you give Me,  I’ll take”.

259
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,720
He’ll take everything. He’s the one who is the only,

260
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,630
Gopta means He is the only enjoyer.

261
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,380
“But what will you get,”

262
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,260
He says, “when you do ananyabhakti?”

263
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,470
Means ‘when you are one with Me.’

264
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,720
That means you are connected with Him.

265
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:19,550
That’s how He has explained bhakti, what is bhakti is very clearly.

266
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
But people don’t understand.

267
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,420
They think that bhakti means you go on singing

268
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:29,630
“Hari Rama, Hari Krishna,” this and that, is bhakti. Is not.

269
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,470
If that was real, they would have achieved something,

270
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,880
but they did not. Now don’t blame Krishna for that.

271
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,920
He has clearly said it should be ananyabhakti.

272
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:46,510
Only by changing your dress, wearing a particular

273
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,590
type of style, that’s not it. That’s all so outward.

274
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:59,300
It’s just to show off, but actually ananyabhakti is within yourself

275
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,840
when you are within that state when you are one with the Divine.

276
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,760
Unless and until that state you have achieved, not only that,

277
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,380
but have established, it doesn’t give you anything.

278
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,510
Many people have told Me, “We are doing so much

279
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,880
of bhakti yog, Mother. We don’t get anything.”

280
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,260
“Really, what sort of bhakti yog?”

281
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,840
We do — read Shri Krishna’s Gita.

282
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,550
Every morning (we) get up at four o’clock, take bath, read Krishna’s

283
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,670
Gita, do this, do that.Then we sing bhajans, this.

284
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,880
We never get anything.

285
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,720
So what is the reason?”

286
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,760
Reason is that you are not one with God.

287
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,720
And when you are one with God, then what does He give you?

288
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:10,510
He won’t give you cheap things which will vanish in no time,

289
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,760
but of some eternal nature. So He gives  you

290
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,920
peace, peace of the heart.He gives you balance.

291
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:29,800
Also He gives you a tranquil temperament,

292
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:39,880
joy of life. All these things are there within us

293
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,550
if we have the bhakti which is after being united,

294
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,260
after the yoga, with the Yogeshwara.

295
00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:00,550
This is what one has to understand.Now, there are many karma yogis

296
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,880
who go on working mad, absolute madly.

297
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,840
They think we are doing, after all,

298
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:15,670
without any desire we are serving people,

299
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,840
we are serving the nation, we are serving this.

300
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,590
Ultimately, what do you get?

301
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,300
What you get may be money. Might be you might

302
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,550
get a good house, maybe all these things,

303
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,420
but you don’t get peace of heart.

304
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,720
You don’t get peace of mind. You don’t get that joy,

305
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:48,800
that joy which has no boundaries, which cannot be explained,

306
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,630
which cannot be described,

307
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,420
that boundless joy, you don’t have.

308
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,340
And you don’t get that eternal peace,

309
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,510
which can stop wars.

310
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,550
Completely, it can abolish this

311
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,920
cruel nature of human beings.

312
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,300
That you don’t get.  But apart from that,

313
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,590
you get the powers.

314
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,260
You get the knowledge —

315
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,760
knowledge, the subtle knowledge about everyone.

316
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,510
You know about everyone, where are they missing the point.

317
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,380
You know about yourself and about others.

318
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:49,380
This knowledge you get, not in the college or in the schools,

319
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,880
but within yourself is the ocean of knowledge

320
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:59,800
and whichever way you want to see, whichever you want to achieve,

321
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,920
is there, there present.

322
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,760
That is what is the real knowledge, what we call

323
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,880
that you achieve through the

324
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,840
sukshagnyana means the subtle knowledge,

325
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,550
knowledge about chakras, knowledge

326
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,260
about the universe. Everything you can get out of this.

327
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:32,420
But then you get more interested in giving knowledge to others.

328
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,840
You don’t want to know so many thing then.

329
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:40,840
What is the need to know about banking,

330
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,470
say, about who is the richest man in the whole world?

331
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,920
All these things you don’t want to know. Your whole attitude changes

332
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:58,760
and what you get is nothing but a kind of a tranquil mind

333
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,760
which knows everything that is to be known..

334
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,920
That is what one has to achieve

335
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,670
Now this country of yours, America, is very kharmakandi.

336
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,720
It goes on doing work, work, work. They’re workaholics.

337
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,760
They work so hard and what do you get?

338
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,920
You get children who are drug addicts.

339
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,470
You get wives who are running here and there.

340
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,510
You get broken families and no peace.

341
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,590
You support wars.

342
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:47,720
Only thing is that so far this country is being protected in a way,

343
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,420
but also you have destroyed so many aboriginals,

344
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,720
so many fundamental things that you should have preserved.

345
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,720
A day may come when they will realise

346
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,340
that this is what they have been doing and this was really wrong.

347
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,880
A day will come when we’ll have so many Realised Souls in America.

348
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:21,920
But just now the situation is (that) the people are just gone

349
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,920
mad with the idea of making money

350
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,590
and they discover that ‘Now no more, finished.

351
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:39,300
So now what to do?’ What to do? Come to Sahaja Yoga.

352
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:47,550
Do Sahaj Yoga and then you will get the treasures of your being

353
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:53,340
which are within you, which will give you all the comfort,

354
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,840
all the joy and all the supremacy that any

355
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,550
amount of money, any amount of power can’t give.

356
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,260
This is what we have to do,

357
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,420
is to take to Sahaja Yoga and make others also Sahaja Yogis

358
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,760
so that they also get that peace, joy and satisfaction;

359
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,800
and this madness of running from one thing to another

360
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:29,300
will be finished because you can never be satisfied with that.

361
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,670
Want to buy today one thing, then tomorrow want another thing,

362
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,800
then want to doing another thing. You are never satisfied.

363
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,380
You don’t get any joy out of what you are desiring.

364
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,260
So your pure desire, it should be to be one with the Divine.

365
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,470
That is how it will work out.

366
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,300
Shri Krishna’s specialty was that

367
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,920
He always supported people who were Realised Souls,

368
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,420
who were on the right path, who were doing righteous things.

369
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,920
He would never support anybody

370
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,510
who may be well off, who may be great thing.

371
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,800
Like a great king was Duryodhana.

372
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,840
He invited Shri Krishna to his house,

373
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,550
to his big palace to be his guest.

374
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,630
Shri Krishna said, “I am sorry.” He went to Vidura,

375
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:42,800
who was the son of a maid, Dasaputra,

376
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:50,720
because Vidura was a Realised Soul. Because he was a Realised Soul,

377
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,340
to Him he was much higher, much greater

378
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,920
than Duryodhana – who was a ruler because he was a crook,

379
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,670
because he was a bad man.

380
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:06,550
So the discrimination between good and bad

381
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,220
becomes one in your mind,

382
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:16,720
becomes one of your inner temperament,

383
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,420
then you are always very much satisfied

384
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,630
because you know you are not been doing

385
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,670
something that is wrong.

386
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,920
The discrimination is the gift of Shri Krishna.

387
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:42,300
Apart from anything else, He gives us the gift of discrimination.

388
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:50,630
That is His style, I should say, to teach you how to discriminate

389
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,300
and then you become experts on discrimination, on vibrations.

390
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,380
On vibrations, you can judge everything so clearly,

391
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,380
so beautifully.  Others may not agree with you,

392
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,920
that’s a different point; but you know

393
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,920
what is right and what is wrong.

394
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,470
And that is what Shri Krishna’s gift is.

395
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:21,470
As it is, you know He is controlling sixteen sub-chakras within us.

396
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:28,420
He controls everything. He controls your throat, nose, eyes, ears.

397
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,920
All these things He controls, but ultimately, what does He say?

398
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,470
He says He is the Virat. Virat means the one who is the great,

399
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,510
great lord,

400
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,760
what we call “akbar” and that’s what in the Muslim

401
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,470
thing  they accept that Allahu Akbar.

402
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,590
I mean, because it is in a poetry, it’s partly

403
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,550
clear, partly not clear, but He was a Virata

404
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,840
and He showed His form to Arjuna

405
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,470
and Arjuna was amazed to see His form, that He’s the Virata.

406
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:26,720
He’s the one who is great, absorbing everything

407
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,720
and He’s the one who is taking out everything.

408
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:37,420
He’s a Yama. He is the one who is the god of death.

409
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,880
He’s so many. You know His names are there written down.

410
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,470
All these powers are with you,

411
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,260
which He uses wherever it is needed.

412
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:56,380
So the Sahaja Yogis first have the power of satisfaction.

413
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,840
It’s tremendous practice, satisfaction.

414
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,800
Imagine in this place,

415
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:06,510
you are all enjoying so much, you are living here so happy.

416
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,380
Shows what? You are so satisfied.

417
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,420
Otherwise nobody would like.

418
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,840
They would say, “No, we want some nice place. What is this?

419
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,380
We don’t want to live here with everyone.” But to live with others,

420
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:23,800
this collectivity also is the blessing of Shri Krishna.

421
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,510
He teaches you to be collective, the fun of collectivity,

422
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,920
the enjoyment of collectivity. A person who is secluded,

423
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,840
who keeps himself off like a drunkard

424
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,260
is not  the one who worships Shri Krishna.

425
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:44,510
The one who is one with Shri Krishna enjoys everyone

426
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,340
who are there, specially if they are all Realised Souls,

427
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,510
that person enjoys their company very much.

428
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,630
That is something so easily understood in your lives

429
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,760
if you see how you live happily, morally,

430
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:07,260
absolutely perfect; in no way you do anything immoral

431
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:13,420
steal anything or have bad feelings for other people.

432
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,420
It’s something surprising that has happened to you,

433
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,920
that you are all living so happily

434
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,800
in one place together with satya.

435
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:29,510
His collectivity is to be understood

436
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,420
because I always say

437
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,590
that Shri Krishna is the deity of America.

438
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,380
America is also very collective.

439
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,920
Like it will be interested in every country.

440
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,880
It will be bothered about everyone,

441
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,720
but in a wrong way tries to help.

442
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,510
Always it is never in the right way.

443
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,420
Now, supposing there is a country where

444
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,720
they are producing a lot of drugs.

445
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,840
Why not invade that country, instead of invading other countries.

446
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,260
He’s like that. Discrimination is missing.

447
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,340
Unless and until you have that,

448
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,670
you cannot use your power of collectivity properly.

449
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,760
Though they are collective, but what collective work have they done?

450
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,720
Even now, they want to say they are separate, they are different.

451
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,550
“Whatever problems we are facing are our own.”

452
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:29,630
So this collectivity has been so much minimised

453
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,670
in a country of Shri Krishna itself.

454
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,340
Though they have that within themselves,

455
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,420
a feeling that they should talk about every country,

456
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,340
they should give lead to every country,

457
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,300
they should consult every country, but

458
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:51,340
always take a wrong decision about those countries.

459
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,260
This comes because they are not discriminating.

460
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,260
They should be discriminating.

461
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:02,880
So many things can be said about Vishuddhi chakra,

462
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,880
but specially I am more concerned about two chakras on two sides.

463
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,510
One of them is, as you know, is the Lalita chakra on left side

464
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,220
and Shri chakra on the right side.

465
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,380
I’ve always told ladies that

466
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,760
please keep this covered.

467
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,300
It looks so simple. It’s very important.

468
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,630
Don’t expose this because power of this should be preserved —

469
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:38,420
Shri chakra and Lalita chakra, they’re very important.

470
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,800
They are, I should say, feminine powers

471
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:46,590
and they are the feminine powers of Shri Krishna,

472
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:52,920
which must be understood that whatever way you respect your body,

473
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,880
that is the way your chakras are and that is the way you suffer.

474
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,880
For example, (if) you do not respect Shri Ganesha, you will suffer.

475
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,590
And if you respect Ganesha and do not behave in a manner

476
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,550
that you should behave, you will suffer. You’ll have problems.

477
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,720
So the whole body reacts.

478
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:24,340
Body reacts to outside influences in such a manner

479
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,760
that you start seeing there is something wrong

480
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,470
somewhere and that’s why you behave like this.

481
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:46,300
Apart from that, eyes are supplied by this chakra,

482
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:55,590
so when you look at something, it should be very pure glance.

483
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,800
The purer it is, the better you will enjoy.

484
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:04,800
But if the glance is not pure,

485
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:10,800
is shifty, going from here to there, there to there,

486
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:18,760
then you are actually going against your dharma,

487
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,260
against your evolutionary process and one day will come

488
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:27,720
when you might become blind, you might develop cataracts.

489
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,510
You might develop all kinds of diseases of the eyes,

490
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:37,420
which are very important to pay attention to it.

491
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:43,510
Then this connect(ion) also goes to the tongue.

492
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,340
The tongue is looked after,

493
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,380
but those people have a very bad habit

494
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:56,630
of suddenly saying horrible things, of suddenly saying

495
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:02,550
very bad words or sometimes getting after somebody

496
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,380
with the very bad remarks.

497
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,920
All such things are very bad for the tongue

498
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,220
and this is what Shri Krishna doesn’t like.

499
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,300
In case you use your tongue for saying harsh things to others,

500
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:23,550
being sarcastic, being harsh on others,

501
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,630
using abusive word,

502
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:32,800
your tongue, one day, I don’t know how it will react.

503
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,630
It will react in different ways.

504
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,880
God knows, it might become thick. It won’t move.

505
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,840
God knows, it might be sucked inside.

506
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:47,470
That’s the physical side of it, but also mental side of it,

507
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,510
that you will [not] know what you are talking about.

508
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,670
If you say something, you’ll say something else.

509
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:59,300
It’s possible with your tongue. It’s quite possible

510
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:04,420
that we may not be able to talk, may not be able to say anything.

511
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:11,300
Anything is possible if you try to trouble

512
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,470
your tongue like that, using it for wrong purposes.

513
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:24,300
Tongue is not for being used for

514
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:30,380
abusive things,as well as for — some people try to be

515
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:35,470
extra kind and gentle and this and that

516
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,670
to achieve some ends.

517
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:44,260
This kind of thing also is very, very much — is dangerous

518
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,300
for the tongue and you might develop blisters on your tongue

519
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,340
to such an extent that people who even

520
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,220
go on saying harsh things to others and all that

521
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:01,510
can develop a kind of a cancer.

522
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,630
Some people think that if you bear up everything is good. Is not.

523
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:12,880
If somebody is trying to oppress you, don’t try to bear it.

524
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:17,550
Throw it away because if you bear also,

525
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,800
you can move to the left and you can get horrible things

526
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,260
like cancer. You can get cancer.

527
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,920
Those who are aggressive, they can get also diseases;

528
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,920
and those (who) are very much, I should say,

529
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:37,510
bearing type also get into trouble.

530
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,630
So you should be in a balanced state,

531
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,470
should not accept anything.

532
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,760
Supposing anybody calls you name just keep quiet look at that person

533
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,880
that’s all. Know that he’s a stupid fool.

534
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,420
But don’t accept it.

535
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,670
If you accept it and go on crying about it and weeping about it,

536
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,380
then you can get cancer. But supposing

537
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,590
somebody says something, you should know (he) is a stupid fool,

538
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,720
just keep out of it, then nothing can happen.

539
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,220
So both ways one has to be careful because Krishna is

540
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:20,590
playing around and He sees how far you can go.

541
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:28,880
Now throat — throat is very important. We should look after it.

542
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,470
Those people who shout,

543
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:40,840
scream ultimately can lose their power of speech,

544
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,220
can become frantic with their problems of the throat,

545
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,840
specially throat can develop horrible disease

546
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:58,340
by which you just — they can just get swollen up.

547
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,840
We call it snake disease

548
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:09,340
and you feel suffocated. So when you talk to someone, talk clearly,

549
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:15,590
in a sweet manner, but don’t shout at the person, never.

550
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,840
Neither you try to show peevishness in your speech.

551
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,760
If you are peevish, then cancer can set in.

552
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,840
So both ways you have to be careful, as you are Sahaja Yogis.

553
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,220
You have to have this knowledge,

554
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:35,420
that you will not do, bear anything nonsensical if anybody speaks —

555
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,220
means you should not accept it.

556
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,720
One may say something to you. It’s all right.

557
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,260
And sometimes you should tell him off

558
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,840
that “You were saying like this, (it) is not so.”

559
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:50,800
It’s best is not to bear it up and to suffer.

560
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,920
You’re not Christ. You don’t have His powers.

561
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,880
Because if you do that, you’ll develop cancer.

562
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,300
So try to be in a way just in the centre,

563
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,800
watching everything, if there’s aggression

564
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:12,340
or if there’s recession (reception) —one of the two things

565
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,760
you must not give in to any of these attitudes,

566
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,760
but develop an attitude  of standing

567
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,920
very firmly on your own grounds.

568
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:27,840
For example, there was a Chinese story I read

569
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:32,380
that there once — a king wanted his

570
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:35,300
two cocks to win in a race,

571
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,840
so they said you send them to a sage and train them up.

572
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:43,420
So he has sent them to a sage. They were trained very well.

573
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,470
And when they were brought, they stood in the arena

574
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,840
and many cocks were there, who started attacking them,

575
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:57,670
but these two were standing like this, least bothered.

576
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,550
They tried and tried, but these two were standing like this.

577
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:07,220
As a result, all of them ran away.

578
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,470
So that’s what is the character you should have.

579
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,340
Is not to bend to something because somebody is aggressive

580
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,920
and also not to aggress others,

581
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,800
not to torture other, not to sit on somebody’s head.

582
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,760
It’s very, very dangerous  for your throat

583
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,630
and such a throat will always, will always be in danger

584
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,420
of getting some horrible diseases.

585
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,800
All this I’ve told you because so many things we know about,

586
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,800
we should reach it. We have

587
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,340
— but we have very subtle knowledge about  Vishuddhi chakra.

588
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,590
We should also have little gross,

589
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,920
that what can happen to our Vishuddhi chakra

590
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,380
if we try not to look after it.

591
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:01,720
So this is what is Shri Krishna’s work. Also teeth He looks after.

592
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,470
Ears He looks after. You know what is to be done

593
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:12,300
about the teeth and the ears. These are His own sixteen —

594
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:19,670
we can say — works. We can call them as karias, sixteen

595
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:24,380
on which He works on different, different levels.

596
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:29,840
And you must try to develop our powers of our

597
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:36,590
Vishuddhi chakra by so many ways and

598
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,550
so many exercises, by understanding

599
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,760
what goes wrong with us when we do not understand

600
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,220
and value our Vishuddhi chakra.

601
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:54,800
Now America is the Vishuddhi of the whole world,

602
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,840
so it is very important that the people who are in charge here

603
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:04,880
should know all the powers of Vishuddhi,

604
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,920
plus how to preserve it

605
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,880
and how to expand it

606
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,550
to the whole world. With these two hands

607
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,880
also are from Vishuddhi chakra

608
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:23,300
and, with that, you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

609
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,880
You have to go to different worlds, different countries,

610
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,840
to — even to small villages you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

611
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,920
Only in the hands first, you see the cool breeze.

612
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:45,420
That means it is you feel the universal

613
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,670
power of the Divine in your life.

614
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,470
So this is the collective, universal love

615
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,880
that comes to your hand and teaches you.

616
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,760
So it’s such an important chakra is this.

617
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,470
In the same way, America’s very important

618
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,760
and, as citizens of America, you should try

619
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,550
to maintain the religion the dharma here

620
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,920
and to create a great understanding

621
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:23,920
for world problems and try to give love

622
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:28,920
to all the people from whatever country they will be coming.

623
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,920
May God bless you all.
