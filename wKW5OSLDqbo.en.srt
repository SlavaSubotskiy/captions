1
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:54,690
But before we come to right conclusion about
our seeking, we have to understand that truth

2
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:10,250
is not a mental action.
If your mind says that "this is this", it

3
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:19,210
need not be that. It is our everyday experience
in life, that mentally, when we try to establish

4
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,839
something, we find after sometime, that we
have not been absolutely correct about it.

5
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,999
Whatever is known to us is already there.
But whatever is unknown, even about that,

6
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:42,889
if you have preconceived ideas, that "this
is the unknown, this is God, this is Spirit",

7
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:49,889
then it could be that you are very much away
from the truth. But scientifically, if you

8
00:14:53,010 --> 00:15:00,010
have to approach any subject, you have to
keep your mind absolutely clean and open,

9
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:07,380
that it has been said by many great Saints,
many great gurus, that we are to be born again

10
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:19,030
and that we are the Spirit. Are we to believe
in them or not? Perhaps, we should reach at

11
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:27,210
least this conclusion that they did not take
any money from anyone and they could not have

12
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:34,210
been fake people, they did not do it for money
sake. So, if we have to be born again, to

13
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,360
reach the right conclusion we should know
what should happen to us. For example if you

14
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:48,360
certify that I am a reborn again, then it
is misleading. Supposing that I certify myself

15
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:55,490
that I am the Prime minister of Australia,
do I become? I have to become! So just by

16
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:01,980
taking a certificate we are cheating ourselves
and avoiding opportunity to be born again.

17
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:08,980
So to be honest is the first way we can really
be the seekers of truth. If we are not honest

18
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,920
and if we have preconceived ... (?) and want
to stick to it, I would say that it is rather

19
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,620
difficult. But logically we should come to
a point where we should understand, that what

20
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:27,620
should happen when we deceive the truth. In
our evolutionary process, what has happened

21
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,480
to us? Actually, our awareness has been enlightened
in new dimensions that lead you up in our

22
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,840
evolution. And animal does not understand
filth scented. You can take a horse through

23
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:49,099
any dirty but a human being is very sensitive
he has to close his noose, or sometimes even

24
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:56,099
refuses to go through that. So in our awareness
something has to happen. And that is not some

25
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:04,849
sort of an abnormal thing. Like some people,
I was told, have written books where you have

26
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:11,130
to become mad to be reborn. I mean in what
evolutionary stage did it happen? Did the

27
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:18,130
fishes become mad to become the higher animals?
When did it happen that you had to become

28
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,489
mad to evolve?
It's a wrong idea that people give because

29
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:31,489
they can only make you mad, nothing else.
And you like it, because one way they pamper

30
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:38,370
your ego by saying that you can pay for that.
Secondly they all give you a feeling that

31
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:44,520
you are something different. To be something
different is not to be evolved. You have so

32
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,959
many mad people in this world. We have so
many epileptic people, we have so many people

33
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:54,599
who jump all over the places. There is nothing
great about it. Whatever you can do easily

34
00:17:54,599 --> 00:18:00,629
is to jump or to shout, to scream or to misbehave,
all these things are very easy for human beings

35
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:02,069
to do.

36
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:08,120
But if something has to happen from the Divine,
and if it is a divine process, then something

37
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:15,120
should happen within us, which is not in our
reach, which is something that is beyond the

38
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:22,930
human reach. That has to be the divine thing.
So we must understand that in our seeking,

39
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:29,930
what we have to see is a higher dimension
to our awareness. In that dimension you have

40
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:37,680
to become something, like you have become
a human being. You are no more a monkey, you

41
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,770
are a human being now. In the same way, you
have to become something.

42
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,350
In Sanskrit language, a Brahmin, who is a
Realized soul, the one who knows the Brahma,

43
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:53,350
the All Pervading Power, is called as "vijaya",
born again. And also a bird is called as "vijaya".

44
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:02,180
A bird is first born as an egg and then it
is born as a bird. There's complete transformation.

45
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,660
You don't have to certify a bird that it is
no more an egg. It just becomes, you see it

46
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:14,810
through that it becomes. So those who are
honest, and those who are really seeking,

47
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:21,740
must know that you have to become something.
It's not just that you become mad or you become

48
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,669
like some sort a funny freaky fellow, but
you become really something that is in your

49
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:31,360
awareness.
Now if you have to go through science, you'll

50
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,449
find out that Jung, who was a Realized soul,
who got his Realization much later, and then

51
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:43,240
he defied Freud, has clearly said that if
a human being evolves, he'll have to become

52
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:50,240
collectively conscious. His consciousness
becomes collectively aware, meaning that you

53
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:02,820
should feel others within yourself, on your
fingertips.

54
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,840
Mohamed has said at the time of Resurrection
[Qyama] your hands will speak. Your hands

55
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,840
have to speak. Now the hands have no tongue
to speak, so what happens? It is accepted

56
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:25,850
in the medical science, that the sympathetic
nervous system is expressed in your seven

57
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,490
centres on your fingers, but they don't know
which are where, and how it is, they cannot

58
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:41,190
put it. And they are all disturbed. But they
say there is a sympathetic connection with

59
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:47,380
the fingertips.
So in your awareness, it has to happen, by

60
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:54,380
which you have to be more alert, more noble,
more dynamic, more beautiful, more loving,

61
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:07,710
more understanding. So something has to happen
to your central nervous system. It must be

62
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:15,360
apparent that your are just feeling something
more in your central nervous system.

63
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,979
Now, what people are enamoured this, that,
if they see some people dancing madly, they

64
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:27,979
feel enamoured, is the sign that you have
not been able to understand. We have seen

65
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:37,300
Christ, we have seen Bouddha, Mahavira, Kabira,
Nanakar [Guru Nanak]. We had Lao Tse and so

66
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:47,690
many others. Did they behave like this? Did
they become mad? We have got Moses, did he

67
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:55,740
become mad anytime, was he mad anytime, behaving
like a mad person? All these new theories

68
00:21:55,889 --> 00:22:01,210
have started I think, fifty years back, or
about sixty years back, that people believe

69
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,990
in these new theories and they have forgotten
all the traditional things that have come

70
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:13,990
to us, our heritage. And we depend more on
these nonsensical things, which has no moorings

71
00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:18,669
at all!
Because the people who are supposed to be

72
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:23,159
the founders of all the religions, have never
behave like this and why this new type of

73
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:29,390
things that has started, that people are behaving
in this manner and accepting it, to be as

74
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:34,490
very normal thing.
So all the seekers must know that you have

75
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:41,490
to become the Spirit, means you must feel
your own powers. It is not that you feel the

76
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,630
powers of another person, now he is a person
who brings down some diamonds for you, so

77
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:52,630
what? Logically you reach a conclusion: do
you want diamonds or do you want your Spirit?

78
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:03,330
You can buy them in the market. Why do you
need a guru to do that kind of a job? There

79
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,190
must be some juggler all kinds of these spiritual
juggleries are on, and when I came here from

80
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:13,190
Perth,..., Melbourne and here, everywhere,
all the people from the medias have been asking

81
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,990
me that why these gurus have come from India
and they have ruined us like this. They have

82
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,890
so many rules, like this and that and that
[laughs]

83
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:27,190
I said thank God that now, at least, you have
realised it. But I went to America and told

84
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:31,440
them long time back that these people are
going to come, and be careful about them.

85
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,200
It has been already told about it, but people
did not want to follow it. They thought that

86
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,060
it is better that you accept a guru, live
with him, and then, when he goes to heaven,

87
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:50,060
means hell actually, you'll be there. Now
we are very happy that the awareness is coming

88
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:59,269
to the seekers, that a lot of them are realizing
that they have not found the truth. If you

89
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:06,269
are reaching that conclusion that you have
to find the truth within yourself, then Sahaja

90
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,959
Yoga will work wonders.

91
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:18,959
Now, our evolutionary process has not been
anything which is dead, it is a living process.

92
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:27,660
There is a force within us which brings forth
our evolution, and living process cannot be

93
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:33,839
activated by mental activity. For example
if you put a seed in the Mother Earth, it

94
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,589
sprouts by itself. By saying that "you'd better
sprout now" or by saying that "it has sprout"

95
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:46,010
you'll have just mental satisfaction of creating
an imaginary image. But actually, it has to

96
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:52,269
happen. The happening has to take place. And
this happening is build within you. That has

97
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:59,269
to happen within your being and is already
you're destined for it. As he has told you,

98
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:06,290
that lies in the triangular bone, which is
very [Inaudible] -you can't even see them.

99
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:12,950
I think it is drawn very small, we should
really enlarge it and show- that is the triangular

100
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:19,950
bone within us which contains this force called
as the Kundalini. Now regarding Kundalini

101
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:25,580
you must have read many books also.
In India, I saw some books I was amazed, written

102
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,269
by mostly foreigners, such big books and they
didn't know where the Kundalini was in the

103
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:35,550
stomach or in the nose. Such confused people
need not have written, if you are confused,

104
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:39,760
better not talk about it. You see, if you
are confused about something, what's the use

105
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,860
of talking that this was the confusion, I
got a choc, and I got a heat and all this,

106
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,920
then why are you talking? You don't know anything
you have no authority. So you have no business

107
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:54,920
to talk about it. That means you are naive
or you're being, just being absolutely a person

108
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:03,240
who is uneducated about it. Why should you
talk when you are not an authority, not only

109
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,209
talk but write? And books after books have
been written by people who have no authority

110
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:13,610
to write these books. And that's how they
have created another myth that Kundalini awakening

111
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:20,610
is the most dangerous thing and one should
not ? Now imagine? What a mistake it is!

112
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,510
Who is the photographer?

113
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:37,510
So, what is the advantage in this kind of
spreading news that Kundalini awakening, which

114
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:48,339
is the epitome of your evolution, which is
what human beings have to achieve in their

115
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:53,459
life, that's the aim of their life, to be
the Spirit. And Kundalini is the only way

116
00:26:53,459 --> 00:27:00,459
it happens. So why should people talk like
this and say it is dangerous to have the Kundalini

117
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:07,790
awakened? Because, why they are doing it,
because they are under some anti-God activity.

118
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:16,450
Because they are not with God, some sort of
a sinister satanic force which is telling

119
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,740
these things to people that you should not
have your Kundalini awakened. Imagine, it

120
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:29,209
is like saying that you should not enter into
the kingdom of God. If that is the only way

121
00:27:29,209 --> 00:27:33,930
if you have to enter into the kingdom of God,
why should you frighten the people about it?

122
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:38,170
There is nothing frightening about Kundalini
awakening I can assure you.

123
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:44,899
I've had, as you know, I've been working for
years together and so many people have got

124
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:51,899
Realization, a-mass, and nobody has got any
problem like that. Sometimes of course you

125
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:59,709
feel little heat in the body, sometimes, you
feel little heat in the body; sometimes a

126
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:04,410
little shaking in the body. If there is a
problem in the body, if your nerves are steel

127
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:11,160
[?] and anything, the Kundalini when she rises,
she little bit shakes you but it settles down.

128
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:17,100
It settles you down completely and you feel
absolutely blissful and peaceful. No problem

129
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:23,889
is created I have seen so far which can be
called anywhere near danger. On the contrary,

130
00:28:23,889 --> 00:28:30,889
when Kundalini rises, she gives so many by-products,
to begin with. Of course, she is the power

131
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,480
of pure desire. The only desire that is pure
in human being is to be one with the Divine.

132
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:48,529
All other desires are not pure because they
do not give you pure joy. You think of anything,

133
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:54,550
you want to say have a car. All right; work
for it, try your loving best to achieve that.

134
00:28:54,550 --> 00:29:01,290
Then you have the car and you want to have
something else. If that was your pure desire,

135
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:08,290
it would have given you complete joy and satisfaction,
it is not so. So matter is making you run

136
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,670
from one to another, but doesn't give you
joy. So the pure desire in a human being,

137
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:20,180
is this great desire to be one with the Divine.
If you do not accept it today, you will come

138
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:24,970
tomorrow. You'll have to take it, because
nothing is going to satisfy you unless and

139
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,350
until you receive the truth, you become one
with the Divine.

140
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,620
People make-I've seen people deny for the
time being, "I'm not ready", that's another

141
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:41,620
style: "I'm not ready" and all sorts of things
people say. But I say: "let me decide" why

142
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:45,779
are you worrying? "Let me decide if you are
ready or not, what is the problem is, it can

143
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:52,410
be worked out. I've really worked for years
together to know all the permutations and

144
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:58,230
combinations and the problems and the valence
you have. And it is not going to take any

145
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:02,730
time for you, it's very simple, it's a living
process, it is not going to trouble you, why

146
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:08,040
should you have fright about it?
So this is one side of Kundalini awakening.

147
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:15,040
The other side is when people think that it
can be done by themselves. It cannot be done

148
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,720
by yourself. Somebody has to do it for you
and then once you get it you can do it for

149
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,170
others. Now for example, a candle which is
enlightened can only enlighten another candle;

150
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:35,470
by itself a candle cannot enlighten. But for
that you have to have a real person, a person

151
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:40,600
who knows everything about the Kundalini,
the one who can awaken your Kundalini and

152
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:46,139
not a person who is already chocked by ?? and
who just talks about Kundalini or he makes

153
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:47,760
people jump all over the places.

154
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,959
There is a guru in India who used to give
Kundalini awakening and where this doctor

155
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:58,959
Warren went first of all. And they all were
jumping and saying "ah, ah, u, u, i, i" and

156
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:05,909
he got such a fright he said he thought it's
a lunatic asylum; he ran away from that place

157
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:10,900
and came to me; he said: "no Mother, don't
give me Kundalini awakening because I'm afraid.

158
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,479
" I said, that's not the way, that's not!
That is hypnosis, a kind of hypnosis, and

159
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:21,299
that hypnosis will create problem and not
your Kundalini, she is your mother and she

160
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:28,299
is waiting for days together, for ages together,
many lives she has waited for the great opportunity

161
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:34,919
to give you your second birth. But so far,
you have not allowed her to do her work, because

162
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,450
mentally you have put all books in your head,
or all gurus in your head, or all kind of

163
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:46,429
ideas in your head. And she poor thing is
waiting for that, to manifest your second

164
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:53,409
birth. And that is a big problem, how to make
people understand that by mental activity

165
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:55,210
you cannot raise the Kundalini.

166
00:31:55,210 --> 00:32:02,210
I may give you lectures after lectures, not
necessary that your Kundalini will rise. But

167
00:32:02,229 --> 00:32:09,139
it will rise when I pay attention to it. And
if you get your Realization, you can also

168
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:14,649
make it raise trough your attention. That
is done through the power of chitta, chitta.

169
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:20,789
But you must have your chitta shakti enlightened.
If you are not an enlightened person, you

170
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:26,239
cannot do it. Can you do it by paying attention
to somebody, raising the Kundalini ? You can

171
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:30,710
see the position of the Kundalini in many
people, those who have got problems in their

172
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:37,100
centres, like the second and the third centre.
You can see it very clearly, what happens,

173
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,820
and you can see it pulsating, it's just like
a heart, the bone pulsating like a heart.

174
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:47,609
You'll be amazed to see that the bone that
looks like a stiff thing is pulsating. You

175
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:53,820
can even see, say, see the raising of the
Kundalini, but if you have a stethoscope,

176
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:59,440
you can hear the "lap dack, lap dack" way
up; this is called as Anahata, means without

177
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,139
percussion, the sound without percussion,
and you can feel it on top of your head, so

178
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:12,139
the same thing raising which Kabira has said,
"only, shimu sharaka" means on the silent

179
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:21,499
peak of your brain you start first feeling
the Anahata, means the sound of "lap dack,

180
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:26,600
lap dack" here in your heart, you start feeling
it here (on top of the head). And when it

181
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:33,600
breaks that area, the fontanel bone area,
which is called as "Talu", you just feel the

182
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:40,960
cool breeze coming out of your head.
Now, this you cannot do. You can jump, dance,

183
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:47,690
become mad, take drugs, take alcohols, he-grow
your beard or cut it off r anything that you

184
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:54,690
want to do, but you cannot make the cool breeze
coming out of your head. And that is what

185
00:33:54,989 --> 00:34:01,710
is the proof that it's a living process that
does this. Unless and until that happens to

186
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:07,460
you, you try everything else it's going to
be a big problem.

187
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:14,460
As I was telling today to the television,
many sincere [?] was the problem with us,

188
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:22,239
with Australians, when you say they are naïve.
I said : "they are naïve because they don't

189
00:34:23,509 --> 00:34:28,749
know what to seek. That's one point, they
don't what they should ask for, what should

190
00:34:28,749 --> 00:34:35,029
happen to them, and they are attacked by people
who are here just to make money, it's money

191
00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:42,029
making proposition. Imagine, people have maid
millions and millions of pounds through you

192
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:50,090
people; it's such a multimillion big enterprise
and it's done on that level. And you people

193
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:57,749
are enamoured by these things because it appeals
to your brain some way or another and I don't

194
00:34:57,749 --> 00:35:04,070
know why, because it appeals to your ego perhaps.
The lady asked me: 'if it is so simple Mother,

195
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,099
then why is it people don't take to simple
things?"

196
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:12,279
Now, see today I came first of all here, at
seven o'clock, and they said there are very

197
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:15,349
few people. So I went round and I came back.
I said: "that's the trouble, they don't want

198
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:20,299
anything simple." But whatever is living is
so simple. You cannot explain it mentally.

199
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:27,249
You put, as I said, a seed into the Mother
Earth, how it sprouts, how a flower becomes

200
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:32,799
a fruit, all these things you cannot explain
mentally. It's a living process done by the

201
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:38,729
All Pervading Power, which is the love of
God, and that activates and works it out and

202
00:35:38,729 --> 00:35:45,729
naturalise which you cannot by your mental
process understand, nor can you do it. You

203
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:51,479
can't transform one flower into fruit.
So this is what one has to understand, that

204
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:57,759
is has to be a living process within us. And
the living process is spontaneous. That is

205
00:35:57,759 --> 00:36:03,789
why we say "sahaja" "saha" means "with" and
"ja" means "born". It's born with you, it's

206
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:10,159
spontaneous. Like your breathing is born with
you, like your pulsation is born with you,

207
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:14,289
like everything which is born with you, you
take it for granted, it exists. In the same

208
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:20,840
way, this Kundalini is born with you. And
this awakening is also your birthright, as

209
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,769
a human being you have the right to have this
awakening within you and you should have it

210
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:31,229
and you must seek that.
But, because of no education on this point,

211
00:36:31,229 --> 00:36:36,909
perhaps, traditionally, we are not educated
to understand. Christ came on this earth,

212
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:42,889
when he wanted to explain all these things
he had to go away and he lived only for four

213
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:48,389
years to talk to people and in that four years
the way people behaved, and he way they never

214
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:53,249
accepted him, it was impossible to talk to
you about Kundalini. But in the Bible it is

215
00:36:53,249 --> 00:37:00,249
written, I will appear before you like tongues,
even in all the Torahs it is written, I will

216
00:37:00,909 --> 00:37:07,909
appear before you like flames of tongues.
Now, what are these flames? These are the

217
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,679
chakras which are within us, when you see
them, they look like that, the flames, you

218
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:20,340
can see them clearly. But it is not the seeing
the that is important, it is being; people

219
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,070
think that if you see the light, now you become
the light. If you see the light [Shri Mataji

220
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,570
shows the ceiling], you become the light?
It's simple, simple thing you can understand

221
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,820
: you do not become a light if you see the
light [Shri Mataji shows the ceiling]. You

222
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:34,389
have to become the light, and when you become
the light what happens, that you act like

223
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:40,830
light. Your power acts like a light. When
you are there people can see how to walk,

224
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:47,830
they know how to understand the difference
between a carpet and a chair and a human being.

225
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:53,649
The discrimination is there. When there is
light, you discriminate and you start understanding

226
00:37:53,649 --> 00:38:00,649
that the truth is this and this is untruth.
So when the Kundalini rises through your fontanelle

227
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,969
bone area the first blessing you get is of
good health. That's a minimum that should

228
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:13,969
happen, but it's a by-product. But I don't
want to emphasize more on good health because

229
00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:18,279
tomorrow we'll get all the hospitals drooping
on my head, that's what I don't want. You

230
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:24,210
have to be first the Spirit and you have to
be the doctors and you, yourself, can treat

231
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:28,549
your body as well as the body of others this
is a minimum that should happen, that you

232
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:35,549
become a healthy person.
Now what does that ? Within us lies a power

233
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:45,409
which is the evolutionary power, in the center,
and it is the power which we call as the power

234
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:58,519
of Mahalakshmi, is the power by which we sustain
our own character, by which we become human

235
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:10,909
beings, from carbon, where it is four valences,
as human beings we develop ten valences.

236
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:19,320
We become eligible for our ascent through
this power to begin with, because this is

237
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:22,710
a power that gives us balance.

238
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:28,289
In the gross it expresses itself as parasympathetic
nervous system. Now, what is parasympathetic

239
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:34,429
nervous system is? That it gives a balance
to your sympathetic nervous system. Now sympathetic

240
00:39:34,429 --> 00:39:39,450
nervous system is the gross expression of
the two other powers which are around us.

241
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:46,219
One is the power of desire, and another is
the power of action. These sympathetic nervous

242
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:52,070
systems come into play when we want to use
them. For example if you want to run fast-

243
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:58,019
so when you are running fast, these two powers
come into power, that they give us the force

244
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:03,309
to run fast. But what is the thing that brings
it back to normal? It's the central power

245
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:08,789
that brings it to the normal or gives it balance.
So this balancing force is the one that is

246
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:14,590
responsible for your ascent. If you are not
yet balanced, the same force will first balance

247
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:21,590
you. Because of imbalances, so many diseases
are caused, there is no and to it. Apart from

248
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:26,739
that, those people who go to extremes, to
the left and to the right, also can develop

249
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:32,340
horrible diseases. Those who go to the left
side develop mostly the psychosomatic diseases,

250
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:39,340
like cancer, like [all ??] and incurable diseases.
And imbalanced people develop - say, blood

251
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:47,509
pressures and diabetes, and all the problems
of the organs in the stomach. And the people

252
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:53,070
who are too much right sided, who are too
much speedy, who are thinking of the future

253
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:59,739
all the time, they develop problems of the
heart and also the problems of the physical

254
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:05,580
side. Those who indulge into too much physical
exercises and all that, also develop the problems

255
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:10,349
of the physical side.
So it is all our doing that we gets it, mostly,

256
00:41:10,349 --> 00:41:11,789
or may be of our parents.

257
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:16,059
For example somebody asked me that "how is
it Mother, that leukaemia is caused in the

258
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:22,159
people who - children also?" They are born
with it. I said the mother must be a very

259
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:27,799
speedy woman. If the mother is speedy, hectic,
her spleen is working in a hectic way, she

260
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:32,869
sets in, in motion the same kind of a spleen
that the child should have. And if that happens,

261
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:38,109
the child develops a kind of a spleen which
is hectic and starts producing RBCs [Red Blood

262
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:44,119
Cells] which are not with the main and not
in proper shape. And these are vulnerable

263
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:51,119
to cancer and things like leukaemia. Because
at this stage, something triggers it and that

264
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:55,669
triggering takes place because of an extreme
behaviour of a personality which I'll explain

265
00:41:55,669 --> 00:41:57,080
to you tomorrow.

266
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:04,080
But in any case, physically, you feel fit,
mentally you feel fit, mentally, because your

267
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:10,859
extreme behaviour disappears. Mostly we take
to habits; any habits we take to is, the reason

268
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:17,859
is because we get bored in life or we are
fed up or we are very unhappy or we are disturbed

269
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:25,820
about something or we are shocked. Under the
circumstances, we take to it. But supposing

270
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:31,919
the reverse happens that you feel settled,
you feel blissful, you feel happy, you feel

271
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:37,919
cheerful, you feel on top of the world, naturally
everything drops of. When you have got the

272
00:42:37,919 --> 00:42:42,190
highest you don't want to indulge into all
these things, which are sensational, for the

273
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,799
time being, work out for a short period. But
you start enjoying that is what is eternal

274
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:52,929
within you, flowing all the time. Stress and
all that also disappears. Because supposing-

275
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:57,789
I give an example always of a car which is
about to finish its petrol, everybody it is

276
00:42:57,789 --> 00:43:02,739
in a stress --the car as well as the driver
is worrying that the petrol is going to finish.

277
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:06,839
But supposing by some chance, you are connected
to the mains and all the time the energy is

278
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:13,839
flowing into you, then, then you have no worry,
you have no worry and just you get over all

279
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:19,820
these things.
People have a very great -- I should emphasize,

280
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:25,399
so we can say all the time a kind of a cocks
in [?] from all the sensational practices

281
00:43:25,399 --> 00:43:32,399
of the society. And this quite upset us, all
the time the way we are, all the time we are

282
00:43:33,299 --> 00:43:36,089
stimulated by these sensations.

283
00:43:36,089 --> 00:43:40,279
Now with Realization what happens, the Spirit
doesn't take note of all this stimulus, nothing

284
00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:46,830
of the kind, it is not bothered about these
things. It is just witnessing the all play

285
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:53,169
as a drama and a joke, and it doesn't take
anything into record, and doesn't react to

286
00:43:53,169 --> 00:43:56,649
it as human beings do. And that's how the
stress stops, drops out.

287
00:43:56,649 --> 00:43:59,889
On the contrary, I have met some people who
have been doing all kinds of things, their

288
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:03,019
hands were going like this, and feet were
going like that, all sort of contortions,

289
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:08,089
and I said "why are you doing it?" They said
"we have been to a guru, and he said your

290
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:12,299
stress is coming out." Now if the stress is
coming out and if this is the state of the

291
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:17,320
stress-laughs- when are you going to end this
up? It is not possible, you must understand!

292
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,009
You see what I feel when I talk about these
things people just leave me and go away because

293
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:27,139
they get angry but I'm for you! I'm for your
good! I'm saying, just understand, that how

294
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:32,839
can stress get out, by this kind of a nonsensical
thing happening to you, you're getting mad!

295
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:37,909
This is not the way the stress has to get
out, but you have to get over the stress.

296
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:43,210
And that is a very simple thing to understand,
that is you are standing in the water, the

297
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:48,070
waves start coming to you, coming and going
and you are afraid of the waves. But supposing

298
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:55,070
by any chance, the state becomes that you
become seated in a boat, someway or another,

299
00:44:55,269 --> 00:44:59,499
you raided up to that part that you are in
a boat, then you enjoy the same waves, from

300
00:44:59,499 --> 00:45:04,200
there, and you don't mind any kind of things.
And this is the state one has to achieve.

301
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,619
Unless and until you achieve that state, all
your guru, all your money is of no value,

302
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:12,769
nothing of the kind. But this should not upset
you.

303
00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:16,779
Because many people also take a view that
we have paid for it, so we'd better go through

304
00:45:16,779 --> 00:45:21,219
it. I mean if you have paid for the poison,
will you go through it? It's simple thing

305
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:25,109
like that because you have paid for it, better
not go through it, because it's dangerous.

306
00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:30,959
You must see what is happening to the people
who are going to these gurus, or to these

307
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:37,959
cults, or to these clairvoyance and all that.
What is happening to them? Are they transforming?

308
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:42,940
Are they getting any of their powers? Have
they become peaceful people? Have they finished

309
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:49,809
their seeking? They think that they have done
it? If not, then no use going to a place like

310
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:53,969
that. But human mind, I don't understand sometimes,
like they see a person coming out of a pub,

311
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:58,979
falling in the dirty lane, and still they
walk in the same pub. So I can't understand

312
00:45:58,979 --> 00:46:05,789
why people do all these things. But, mainly,
we have to know that, one day will come when

313
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:10,440
we'll face ourselves and that time, we'll
ask a question that : "why did I not use my

314
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,769
wisdom to understand that these are not the
things I was asking for. What I was asking

315
00:46:15,769 --> 00:46:18,379
what the ultimate, the truth."

316
00:46:18,379 --> 00:46:23,299
Those who talk about love of God, power of
God, it's very easy because, you see, you

317
00:46:23,299 --> 00:46:28,119
can read any book and start talking, then
it's "power of God, power of love and all

318
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:35,119
that". But it must act. If you talk of compassion
it must act. It is not just I say that I'm

319
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:38,039
compassion and embodiment of compassion, so
what?

320
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:42,450
You may be embodiment of compassion. I can
gather some money from you people and start

321
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:48,889
a hospital here and say I have treated so
many people here, you give me a big prize

322
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:54,469
for- it's nothing. That's not the way the
compassion acts. Compassion acts in the same

323
00:46:54,469 --> 00:46:59,279
way as the sun shine acts. If you are near
such a person- you remember that somebody

324
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:05,099
touched Christ, and something went into that
person. Christ said : "somebody has touched

325
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:06,200
who's sick". [Luc-8-46: But Jesus said, "Someone
touched me; I know that power has gone out

326
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:12,330
from me."] The person got cured. The compassion
must act, otherwise it has no meaning, it's

327
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:17,929
just talks, advertises that you are the love
power and all that. It's not so. Something

328
00:47:17,929 --> 00:47:24,929
has to happen that is not also madness or
any kind of a crackpot behaviour but by which

329
00:47:27,129 --> 00:47:32,529
you keep your transformation. And that what
you should ask for, for the reality and not

330
00:47:32,529 --> 00:47:39,499
for unreal, and in reality, you'll be amazed,
you will see where you stand as far as you

331
00:47:39,499 --> 00:47:45,659
are concerned and others are concerned. What
is the reality position? That you are the

332
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:50,589
part and parcel of the whole, you start feeling
that you are part and parcel of the whole.

333
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:55,450
And when that happens, there is no compassion
that speaks. Because supposing this finger

334
00:47:55,450 --> 00:48:01,789
is paining, automatically I press this finger.
I just pres it , because it is, it is paining

335
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:07,289
and I just feel it because it's me, it's me
there so I just do it. So that's how the compassion

336
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:12,029
acts, it doesn't think it is doing any obligation
to anyone, that this finger should pay anything

337
00:48:12,029 --> 00:48:19,010
to me. It's mine, it's myself, how I can I
not touch it and put it right. In the same

338
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:24,010
way it happens that you become part and parcel
of the whole. And when you become that, you

339
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:31,010
just act as a part of that whole, with all
its powers. And that should happen to all

340
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:34,109
of you who are seekers.

341
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:38,389
Normally Sahaja Yoga is better for people
who are not extremes by nature, who are centred

342
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:43,660
people, that's very good, it acts very well
on them and helps them in many things. Also

343
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,900
those who are in extremes are also brought
[drown?] in the center, because Kundalini

344
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:54,900
is a movement in the central path and you
are paying attention to me, and I say "you

345
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:00,210
pay attention to yourself, you cannot." But
when Kundalini rises she sucks in your attention

346
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:06,319
inside like an incident or happening within
and then the attention, even if it is on the

347
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:12,470
extremes, is sucked inside. And when it is
sucked in, it just rises out. One must know

348
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:17,630
lots of things happen when it rises. It just
doesn't rise just like a premule rising up

349
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:23,789
but lots of things happen within your body.
Lots of centers go into different kind of

350
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:28,529
banghas and all that, it happens. As a car
starts, lots of things happen in the inside

351
00:49:28,529 --> 00:49:33,380
machinery, in the same way, when the Kundalini
starts rising, lots of things happen inside,

352
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:38,960
but very smoothly. Because you are fantastically,
beautifully and delicately made, with great

353
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,420
care.

354
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:46,319
It's not easy to destroy Kundalini, it's not
easy, but I've seen some people have got very

355
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:52,069
sick kundalini, some people have bleeding
Kundalinis I've seen. And of course, if they

356
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:58,529
are devils, they may not have Kundalini at
all. But it is not easy to destroy this bone

357
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:04,970
also. If you burn the body of a human being,
this bone is the last to be burnt and requests

358
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:11,369
very high temperature to burn it. That's why
people call it a sacred bone, But when I went

359
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:14,490
to Greece, and I asked people "why did you
call it sacrum?" They said "because we had

360
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:21,490
a rapport with a Hindu Aryan group much before
Alexander went there, and they told us this

361
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:28,019
is sacred bone. And we found out that when
you burn the body, this bone remains still

362
00:50:28,019 --> 00:50:31,650
there. So we thought, must be something sacred
about it."

363
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:37,559
Now tomorrow, the day after and after that,
we're going to have 3 more programs. Today,

364
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:40,660
in a general way, I've spoken to you because
they said 'just give introduction to Sahaja

365
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:46,760
Yoga, what is Sahaja Yoga is, and that's why
I've told you that you cannot pay for it,

366
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,589
it is effortless, it is spontaneous, it's
a living process and through the grace of

367
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:58,589
God it works. And by this happening, you get
your transformation. And you become something

368
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:03,990
else that what you are in your awareness;
you become a more powerful person, a dynamic

369
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:10,349
person, you start feeling another person.
It's a fact. You can ask somebody who must

370
00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:16,470
come now all the way from Perth. And when
he came to me, he was in a big problem because

371
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:21,789
he had been to guru, these things, and he
realized that he made a mistake and that he

372
00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:27,829
could rectify but now he is rectified and
he could feel this cool breeze actually on

373
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:34,210
his head and all over. So this is the thing
one has to understand that you must honestly

374
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:40,010
ask for the truth and not for something that
has been told you before.

375
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:44,809
This is what it is, it should happen to you,
that has never happened before and cannot

376
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:51,119
happen through human effort.
So tomorrow, the day after and after that,

377
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:57,140
we have 3 more days. One day I will talk about
chakras, tomorrow, and then these 3 powers,

378
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,730
and last day I'll tell you what is to be done
after Self Realization, how to keep it up,

379
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:07,299
how your Spirit is your guru, and how it teaches
through your vibratory awareness, how you

380
00:52:07,299 --> 00:52:11,769
understand what is right and hat is wrong.
I think that is how we'll space it up and

381
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:12,829
we'll work it out.

382
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:18,190
But today, we should try to have a session
of Self Realization also, and it might be,

383
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:20,829
might work out very well.
May God bless you.

384
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:25,279
If you have any questions, I would like to
have the questions because it's important

385
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:30,210
if you have any sensible questions. But, I
don't know, some people say "in this book

386
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:34,230
it is written, in that book it is written
or this one says like that." Please, don't

387
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:39,549
do that. Because all these books have given
you nothing, so better forget about them.
