1
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:09,999
Today we have decided

2
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:14,834
to have a puja of Virata

3
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:20,083
in the land of Shri Krishna.

4
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:28,917
As you know, in the growth of Shri Vishnu's manifestation,

5
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:34,333
He comes into ten incarnations

6
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:41,125
and ultimately He manifests Himself as Virat.

7
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:58,667
Virat is the brain of the being which can call as God Almighty,

8
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,999
so the whole central nervous system is worked through

9
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:11,375
by Shri Krishna as Vishnu,

10
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,667
then all this incarnations,

11
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:20,417
then Shri Krishna and ultimately as Virat.

12
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:25,125
This is the development of our brain

13
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:29,709
and when we are worshipping Virat,

14
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:34,999
we have to know that within us also we have got

15
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:40,999
the manifestation of this power of Virat.

16
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:44,999
That manifestation which we have

17
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:52,999
we can call it as Virat if Shri Krishna is Mahavirata.

18
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,417
You all know about Virat

19
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:59,041
much more than I can tell you today

20
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:04,125
because It's the whole,

21
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,208
It's the totality.

22
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:15,792
And the totality of everything, if that is Virat,

23
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:18,999
then that is in your brain,

24
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:24,999
but reality is in your heart.

25
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:29,208
So the totality you may see,

26
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,417
you may witness,

27
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:36,999
the reality is the subtlety behind it.

28
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:40,750
So the brain which is not ruled by the heart,

29
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,458
which is not nourished by the heart,

30
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,999
is a very dangerous thing,

31
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,417
because it creates extroversion,

32
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:54,959
and such a person who is without any heart

33
00:02:54,999 --> 00:03:00,917
tries to do things, becomes very ruthless

34
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:03,458
and can be very dangerous.

35
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,834
It could the other way also within us;

36
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,542
that if we allow our heart to rule us,

37
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:13,999
only live with our emotions

38
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,291
and not to use our rationality,

39
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:22,166
then we can become really very dangerous people to ourselves.

40
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:25,500
In the sense, we become lethargic,

41
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:30,959
we become indulgent into wrong sort of things.

42
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:34,667
And today what one feels that in America

43
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,250
there's more dominance

44
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:40,375
of the left side than of the right.

45
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:44,583
Right side is our attention

46
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:47,999
and the right side of attention is we can say

47
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:52,000
is the liver of God Almighty.

48
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,917
So now when we have to talk of the totality,

49
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:57,250
when we are part and parcel of the totality

50
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:02,500
and now we are awakened to that existence of ours

51
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,999
as the part and parcel of the whole,

52
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:08,208
then we have to realize to become the whole

53
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,750
we have to do something about it.

54
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,458
Specially in the land of Shri Krishna

55
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,667
we have to work out this tremendous task

56
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:21,208
of creating Viratas out of Sahaja Yogis.

57
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:26,999
After going through the various experiences

58
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,208
of American Sahaja Yoga,

59
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,041
I've reached a conclusion

60
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,709
that we have to talk more frankly about things

61
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:37,999
than we have been talking before.

62
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:42,500
Why there's such a failure of Sahaja Yoga in this great country

63
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:46,999
while there are so many seekers.

64
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:53,667
The main point is that we do not realize

65
00:04:53,792 --> 00:05:00,291
that the left side is overpowering this country very much.

66
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:06,291
There are people who are active,

67
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:12,750
but the percentage is very low

68
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,083
because of too much of affluence,

69
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,792
too much of freedom,

70
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:22,792
the idea of "what's wrong in anything."

71
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:27,083
People are going towards shamelessness,

72
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:32,667
immoral life, self-indulgent.

73
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:36,875
And this self-indulgence, to protect that,

74
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,999
people always develop a kind of a ego

75
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:45,917
which has no dynamism in it.

76
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:51,999
So now the problem lies with Sahaja Yogis,

77
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,458
not with Sahaja Yoga as such.

78
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,999
When you see that the land is not so fertile

79
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,999
and here you have to work very hard,

80
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:04,291
the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis in America

81
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,625
is to go deep.

82
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:11,750
You can see wherever the land is not fertile

83
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,667
the trees go very deep down,

84
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:21,000
they dig very deep into the Mother Earth

85
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,999
for the sap to be sucked in.

86
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,959
And the same way they grow very high,

87
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:35,083
because the strength of their deepening

88
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,667
gives them this great height.

89
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,709
So they grow very tall

90
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,834
and also they are very deep.

91
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:45,166
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis of America

92
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,709
have to work out

93
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:49,458
because here it's so much superficiality

94
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,709
and so much of frivolousness

95
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:56,208
and also no meaning to their lives.

96
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,291
They have no meanings at all

97
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:02,041
and they are just frittering away their lives

98
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,999
with all nonsensical ideas about their emotions

99
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:07,542
and their love and all those things.

100
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:11,917
So what we need today are Sahaja Yogis who are right-sided,

101
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,999
those who will produce results,

102
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,999
those who will be dynamic.

103
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:20,500
They don't have to worry that somebody is right-sided

104
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,250
and he'll become right-sided,

105
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,542
actually that is what is needed today.

106
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:27,999
Unless and until you have people who are dynamic

107
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,083
we cannot work it out.

108
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:33,041
It's a reaction in this country as well as in England,

109
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,999
in many countries who dominated other people.

110
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:38,792
Like you see in this place

111
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,792
which was actually originally belonged

112
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:48,500
to some tribes of Indians

113
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:52,999
and the English, the Spanish and all these Europeans came,

114
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:54,999
killed them and occupied here.

115
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:56,417
It's a highway robbery,

116
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,041
absolutely highway robbery.

117
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:04,417
Because of their arrogance and their aggressiveness,

118
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:07,458
they could not see that they were doing such a horrible thing.

119
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,792
I mean, why call any names of Hitler,

120
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:12,999
they're even worse than Hitler,

121
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:15,417
because at least Hitler was taken to task,

122
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,999
he was condemned and people know that it was a mistake.

123
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,917
But what about those who came all the way from there

124
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:24,792
and killed so many people here

125
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:28,458
and nicely having a very nice time everywhere

126
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,999
as great Americans

127
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:33,999
and now they are trying to show off everywhere.

128
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,041
Actually it's such a sinful thing that is done

129
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,999
that all these souls which have died

130
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,999
I think have possessed them

131
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:46,500
and now today America is on the left hand side.

132
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:51,208
The right hand side of Americans is finished now,

133
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,834
they are on the left hand side, guilty,

134
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,834
feeling guilty they are taking to indulgences.

135
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,999
Once you go to the right side, you see,

136
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,291
you are very disciplined

137
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:06,542
and you become very ascetic by temperament,

138
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:11,291
I should say, and you want to dominate others

139
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,083
and you want to capture.

140
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:17,999
But today the situation of England and America is just the same.

141
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:20,999
In England the same thing I find with Sahaja Yogis

142
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:23,000
they are just lovey-dovey types, you see,

143
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:28,834
and all they love Me and love Me and love Me.

144
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:31,667
And I just don't understand.

145
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:32,999
What's this going on?

146
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:34,709
They all love Me

147
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,999
and they'll bring flowers for Me, finished.

148
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:39,333
Is this the way we are going to work our Sahaja Yoga

149
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,999
in that England and in this America?

150
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:47,667
"Mother, I love you very much." So what?

151
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:54,709
So to become one part and parcel of the whole,

152
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:57,792
a drop has to become the ocean,

153
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:00,208
you have to become great people,

154
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,583
you have to be responsible.

155
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:06,333
And this lovey-dovey business that you have

156
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,834
has to go out of your mind completely,

157
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,250
otherwise Sahaja Yoga cannot work out in these two countries

158
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:16,999
and you'll be cursed one after another.

159
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:19,417
There are shocks after shocks

160
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:23,917
that are coming to this country as well as to England.

161
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:27,000
But people are not learning any lessons from that,

162
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,834
still it is all right;

163
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,291
we get this disease, all right;

164
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,999
then we glorify it.

165
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:38,417
If we are suffering from ecological difference,

166
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:39,999
still we are glorified.

167
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,667
If you are using too much of machinery out of balance,

168
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,333
still we are glorified.

169
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:48,583
Because they just want self-indulgence.

170
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:51,709
Just for self-indulgence they don't want to see the point

171
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:55,542
that what is going wrong with this country is that,

172
00:10:55,667 --> 00:11:00,875
that they do not see anything that is reality.

173
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:03,667
And the reality, though it is in the heart,

174
00:11:03,792 --> 00:11:05,667
though it works in the heart, it has to act.

175
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:12,333
This has to act and if it does not act,

176
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,999
this kind of a passive behavior

177
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,583
is not going to help you.

178
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,250
Now at this old age of Mine

179
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,083
I'm traveling from places to places

180
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,000
and I'm doing so much.

181
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:32,333
Now let us think about it: what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

182
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:35,458
Those who see you,

183
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:41,083
see you as sometimes as just some hippies with disheveled hairs

184
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,999
and something that kind of a thing.

185
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,999
This is the report I have,

186
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,709
from people who came to your centers and things like that.

187
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,333
"Oh, they are a set of hippies, you see," just like that.

188
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,750
So the first thing a Sahaja Yogi has to do,

189
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,291
has to make up something of his personality,

190
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:59,542
in America is very important.

191
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,999
They are studying, they are out of job,

192
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,999
they are doing this, that.

193
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,500
That sort of people are not going to help Sahaja Yoga at all,

194
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,500
they'll be liabilities on Sahaja Yoga.

195
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:14,375
If you really want to do something you have to become something.

196
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,667
You have to study, you have to become something,

197
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:20,792
you have to have some sort of a degree, diploma, something

198
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:23,583
attached to you, you have to mean something.

199
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:27,041
Hippies cannot run Sahaja Yoga in America;

200
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:34,500
they may run better in India but not here.

201
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,999
So one has to realize that

202
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,999
what has gone wrong with us is that

203
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:43,250
we are now following a very subtle way

204
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:48,750
of the same trends that we have taken.

205
00:12:48,875 --> 00:13:07,959
After Realization, we think that we are realized souls,

206
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:09,999
that we have become yogis now,

207
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,709
that we are realized souls.

208
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,417
But one should see

209
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:20,083
that we have become realized souls, no doubt,

210
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:25,999
but whatever bindings we had before coming to Sahaja Yoga

211
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:30,083
have become subtler.

212
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:40,500
They have not expressed themselves as lights,

213
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:45,291
just we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis.

214
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:49,709
We believe that we have vibrations

215
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,709
and also we can feel the vibrations.

216
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,041
But still we have not reached that state

217
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:02,333
where we have become the totality.

218
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,667
We have to still grow.

219
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:08,917
And if you are settled down with your vibrations

220
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:11,083
and thinking that you are all right,

221
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,834
you are sadly mistaken.

222
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:18,083
Whatever were our conditionings before coming to Sahaja Yoga,

223
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:22,083
say you were a hippie,

224
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,041
so the enlightenment has come,

225
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:29,999
but then the idea of this love business is there.

226
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,959
Supposing you were a business man,

227
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:35,166
so the enlightenment has come to you

228
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,208
and you think that Mother should help you in your business,

229
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,041
that's what it is.

230
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,999
Supposing now if you were unmarried

231
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,792
and you are married in Sahaja Yoga,

232
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:48,917
then you want that your marriage should be successful

233
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:51,041
in Sahaja Yoga.

234
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:57,999
If there has been a problem in your health or something like that,

235
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:01,291
then you have become a subtler person that you think,

236
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:06,291
"I asked help from Mother for that."

237
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:12,709
But we do not think that what have we contributed to Sahaja Yoga.

238
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:17,875
We had certain things

239
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:23,333
which we thought were wrong - maybe that,

240
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:23,834
but in Sahaja Yoga we do not see those things are with us,

241
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:29,542
still continuing with us.

242
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:33,999
To become Virata we have to really examine ourselves,

243
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:38,500
without any anger, malice or anything, but see for ourselves.

244
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:42,000
I know people who are small-minded,

245
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:47,291
who have jealousies and their jealousies continue.

246
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:50,709
Supposing there's a good musician,

247
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:55,166
they'll not appreciate if the other person is a musician,

248
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:57,500
he will not appreciate,

249
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,750
he will not encourage that person that,

250
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:05,542
"Really I am a musician, he's also a musician, let me help him."

251
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:11,792
So the small-mindedness that existed before

252
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:14,999
still becomes in a glorified way.

253
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,999
The person will think that

254
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:20,083
"All right, I am a musician and I sing very well

255
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,999
and I am singing Mother's praise."

256
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:25,458
But anybody else who's singing

257
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,709
will not be appreciated

258
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:32,542
to that extent as you should expect

259
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:38,625
that you are a part and parcel of the whole.

260
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,999
This hand, if it feels hurt,

261
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:47,166
the another hand immediately helps it.

262
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:56,333
In the whole body you see the system is so totally connected.

263
00:16:56,458 --> 00:17:02,458
As soon as you eat food, the digestive system starts working.

264
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,917
But we should watch ourselves.

265
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:06,166
If you have to become deeper,

266
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,083
we have to watch ourselves where are we lacking.

267
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,999
Now how does a tree grow?

268
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:12,333
I have told you many times the story

269
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,291
that there's a little cell at the end of the root

270
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:17,458
and it knows,

271
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:21,542
and it knows one purpose: that it has to become a tree,

272
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,000
so it goes round.

273
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,583
It sees a boulder or something, stone, goes round it,

274
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,083
doesn't fight it.

275
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:32,083
Because ultimately what we have to achieve

276
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:35,083
is to become the tree,

277
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,125
so we have to keep that in view,

278
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,041
that we have to become the tree

279
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,917
and not some sort of a small little frog here and there

280
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:47,417
croaking about Sahaja Yoga.

281
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:51,625
No, that's not going to work out!

282
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,999
And this is what I find

283
00:17:54,041 --> 00:18:00,083
also very true about people in, say, England, same thing.

284
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,417
The leaders are fighting,

285
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:04,500
the leaders are trying to find out ways and methods

286
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,291
how to improve the quality of Sahaja Yogis,

287
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:08,834
but it's the Sahaja Yogis

288
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:11,583
who have to know that the responsibility is theirs.

289
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:18,250
They have to grow, they have to become Viratas.

290
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,999
And this is America

291
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,999
where I told you is the place of Shri Krishna,

292
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:26,041
where Shri Krishna became the Virat.

293
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:34,083
Unless and until you see for yourself

294
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:39,417
that we have to do this, we have to become this,

295
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:44,041
you are still busy with our little, little silly problems.

296
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,917
It's a vicious circle,

297
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,999
as soon as you start worrying about your silly problems

298
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:54,417
and your old stuffs still becoming glorified in Sahaja Yoga,

299
00:18:54,875 --> 00:19:00,709
then you find the vicious circle starts working,

300
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,792
it doesn't achieve anything,

301
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:07,083
it doesn't give you good chances,

302
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:11,542
it doesn't give you confidence.

303
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:16,709
It's such a thing, it's like a packaging as they call it.

304
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:21,417
But as soon as you decide, "No, I am going to do it,"

305
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,458
you people are Sahaja Yogis,

306
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,583
you know all about Kundalini,

307
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:28,999
you know all about awakening,

308
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:34,458
you know all about higher stages of attainment,

309
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:39,999
you all, everyone is capable of giving Realization to people.

310
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:42,999
You know where the thing is stuck,

311
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:48,999
everything you know, but now just think about it,

312
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:57,291
how many of you have been able to do something about it?

313
00:19:57,417 --> 00:20:03,250
When people see you their idea about you is very poor.

314
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:08,041
They think that you are stuck up with your wives,

315
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,667
so the wife is very dominating,

316
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,750
so this is happening.

317
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,500
Suddenly you go off,

318
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,250
you see your child, worried about this one, you ...

319
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:21,041
Sometimes I am surprised that once they are married,

320
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,999
they have a child,

321
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:27,208
then they become nothing but the parents of the child, finished,

322
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,417
Sahaja Yoga is finished.

323
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,999
Then the child becomes important.

324
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:38,542
The blessings become the bindings.

325
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:43,083
So you have to watch within yourself

326
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:47,375
that we are here for liberation, for complete freedom.

327
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:49,417
But in the subtle way

328
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:52,083
all these things go on binding

329
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,166
you and you are attached to it

330
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,999
and you don't know how they are still tagging you down,

331
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,792
don't allow you to fly,

332
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:01,291
they don't give you the freedom

333
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:06,083
that is your own right to have it.

334
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,999
So even if I make a aeroplane,

335
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:11,458
I do everything, put the fuel into it,

336
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:17,166
I say everything, but doesn't want to fly.

337
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,792
Now what do you do with such an aeroplane

338
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:22,709
which doesn't want to fly?

339
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:25,834
This sort of a situation is there

340
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:29,208
and this situation makes you so limited

341
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:33,999
and so dwarfy. How will you grow?

342
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:38,333
Unless and until you grow and you show that

343
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,999
in your day to day life

344
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,792
into your personality, into everything,

345
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:46,250
I assure you nobody is going to be impressed by you.

346
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:51,166
Sahaja Yoga is not going to work by advertisement,

347
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,834
nor by My photographs,

348
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:58,291
it's going to work by your work, by your responsibility,

349
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,834
by your shouldering Sahaja Yoga,

350
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:05,792
it's your responsibility to spread Sahaja Yoga and to establish it.

351
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:09,083
But first of all your shoulders should be strong.

352
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,458
You are still out of job,

353
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,709
you are still something, somebody hanging in the air,

354
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,959
you are still somebody who'll not even look at you.

355
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:23,458
Then how can you carry on your shoulders?

356
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:29,792
So first thing is to build yourself inside

357
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,834
as well as outside,

358
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,709
but such a vicious circle I tell you.

359
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:35,999
If you do not go deep into yourself,

360
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:38,792
you cannot also get the outside thing,

361
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:40,333
so it works hand in hand,

362
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,999
as soon as you start building yourself inside,

363
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,041
you'll be amazed how things will work out,

364
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:49,834
how you'll become dynamic, how you'll become great.

365
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,417
But you get involved into things

366
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:55,166
which are very small and transitory.

367
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:59,542
So as I told you before, we are seeking the eternal.

368
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:02,208
So the transitory things are to be only used

369
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:07,375
very temporarily, what we need is not so important.

370
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:11,291
If you can understand this thing clearly,

371
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:17,417
that we still are not free, not detached

372
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:22,999
from all the things we had before Sahaja Yoga

373
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:26,166
and they have become subtler and subtler and subtler.

374
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:31,500
We are still only using Sahaja Yoga for that purpose

375
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:37,542
and not for spreading the light.

376
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:46,417
So what's going to happen?

377
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:50,500
This is absolutely,

378
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:56,166
absolutely to be really to be understood within yourself.

379
00:23:56,291 --> 00:24:00,417
Sometimes My lectures, you see, are little harsh,

380
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:04,417
people think that Mother had to say these things,

381
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:07,500
this is also out of My love for you

382
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,333
and out of My love for this country.

383
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,999
You have to really see to yourself,

384
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:23,999
"What are we? Where are we?"

385
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:31,166
We are not going to end up because Sahaja Yogis we had

386
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:39,625
were subnormal people in the society.

387
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:42,999
If you see the gurus how they spread themselves,

388
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:45,333
though they are false, they are useless

389
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:49,166
but everybody knows about somebody who comes up. In two months time

390
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:52,917
all over the world you can hear about that person.

391
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:53,999
What they do,

392
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:57,542
they go and first of all see the people who are successful,

393
00:24:57,667 --> 00:25:00,333
who are prominent in the city.

394
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,417
They never bother about people who are drug addicts,

395
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:06,834
or who are suffering from diseases, no nothing doing,

396
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:10,291
they have no business with them.

397
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:12,792
They'll just attack the people

398
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:16,792
who are very successful, who are very rich,

399
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:20,291
because they are on top of the society,

400
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:22,166
so they'll go and meet people

401
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:25,291
and make contacts with them and ask them and this and that

402
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:27,999
and then they call them for the program,

403
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,999
give them all the importance, everything,

404
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:31,208
then people start thinking,

405
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:34,667
"Oh God! What a great thing it is to be here."

406
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:38,709
Then pamper their ego a little bit, this and that's how they spread.

407
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:41,667
But there's no reality in it, there's nothing,

408
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:42,999
nothing special about it,

409
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,333
it's all useless, it's all artificial.

410
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,999
But that is how they sell themselves.

411
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:50,959
Though we do not want to sell ourselves,

412
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:52,458
we have to know that

413
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:56,999
unless and until we have some remarkable qualities,

414
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,999
people are not going to look at us,

415
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:02,625
because whatever has happened is within ourselves,

416
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:05,041
and nobody sees the light,

417
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:10,999
it's like a light which is burning, which is covered completely.

418
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:14,417
So I've seen that

419
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:17,999
I went to Columbia. In Columbia, you'll be amazed

420
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:20,208
that people had never known Me,

421
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:21,999
they had never heard My name,

422
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:25,083
but I don't know why but

423
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:29,625
the crowds were so much that I couldn't enter into the compound

424
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,667
and with somehow or other I was pushed into it.

425
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:35,125
Then in the hall was impossible,

426
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,999
people were hanging on the â€“

427
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:39,792
I thought they were hanging

428
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,917
from the top, just sitting on the thing to watch Me over.

429
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:44,999
So many people in every direction, in every height

430
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:49,333
I found people there, I did not know how to settle them down.

431
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:51,834
But they listened to Me very carefully this thing,

432
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:55,417
two days we had the programmed, two days the crowds were there.

433
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:58,959
And then when they had to follow-on they came,

434
00:26:58,999 --> 00:27:02,083
next day they disappeared.

435
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:03,792
Same thing in Greece,

436
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,999
same thing in Turkey.

437
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:13,667
So there's definitely something wrong with us.

438
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,291
Now there's a course coming up,

439
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,208
people are trying to do the course business,

440
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:23,542
but one should know it is not knowledge without love,

441
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:25,333
it is love and knowledge.

442
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:26,999
So how you talk to them,

443
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:30,125
how you deal with them is there,

444
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:33,625
but your dynamism is going to impress them.

445
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:36,291
You can see the film we saw yesterday

446
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:39,458
in which the music was there. Now what was it?

447
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:41,999
There the energy was dynamic,

448
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:46,166
the energy was dynamic, with the music and everything

449
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:47,667
and that was showing.

450
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:50,166
So you see you got engrossed into it,

451
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:53,125
so the movement of that energy, the dynamism of that energy

452
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:55,999
really got you engrossed.

453
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:01,999
But to be afraid that you'll become right-sided is nonsensical,

454
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:09,375
now you are in the center, how can you become right-sided?

455
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:18,750
This kind of argument is only to support lethargy,

456
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,417
then not to have any discipline.

457
00:28:21,709 --> 00:28:24,417
I was surprised that in Shudy Camp,

458
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:29,166
where we have established a school for meditation,

459
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,000
people come every week-end just to spend the week-end,

460
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:35,458
they get up at 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

461
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,041
whenever they feel like,

462
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:39,999
they are on holidays in Shudy Camp.

463
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:44,959
And two days they'll stay there without any meditation,

464
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:46,458
without anything.

465
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:48,166
We have come to Mother's house, finished.

466
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:52,709
Mother has to do all the job for them.

467
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:56,667
I mean, for a Sahaja Yogi it is minimum of minimum

468
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:58,417
that they should get up early in the morning,

469
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:01,041
have their bath and sit down for pujas.

470
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:05,041
Is a common thing, all Indians do that way,

471
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:07,417
It's a practice.

472
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:09,458
Suddenly this country

473
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:13,291
or these countries have gone into a kind of a lethargic

474
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:14,500
nonsensical life,

475
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:18,959
otherwise this country also used to do the same thing.

476
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:25,333
And sleeping also: you have to sleep early if you want to,

477
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:30,999
but one has to think that we have to change our lifestyle,

478
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,999
we have to change our attitudes,

479
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:38,583
so many things, see, like I said simple things, like I said,

480
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:40,959
"The day you want to wash your hair,

481
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:45,667
put lot of oil in your hair and then wash. We'll become bald."

482
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:50,999
Imagine all bald Sahaja Yogis walking.

483
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:56,999
They'll think your Mother has so many hair and what about your hair.

484
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:02,667
In food also, too much, like

485
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:05,625
I don't know here what is the situation, but in England I find

486
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:07,999
they take so much of tea,

487
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:11,999
all the time the tea is - the kettle is on the thing.

488
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:14,709
I mean people are amazed

489
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:18,083
when they, people come to Ganapatipule also in India,

490
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:20,999
we don't take tea so many times,

491
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:22,999
I mean twice at the most.

492
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:24,999
The whole day people want tea there,

493
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:26,166
they don't understand

494
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:31,959
how can they go on drinking tea at one o'clock in the night.

495
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:42,166
It's like the alcohol has become subtler: tea ,

496
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:45,999
otherwise how do you explain?

497
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:48,999
You can't take alcohol, so let's have tea,

498
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:52,208
then settle down nicely, we are having cup-o-tea,

499
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,999
in England very common:

500
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:57,333
sit down nicely, cup-o-tea.

501
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:02,959
What work have you done that you are settling down like that?

502
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:07,792
Then whenever they'll come, "Haaa,"

503
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:10,083
as if they have dug up something,

504
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:15,333
or they have done the English Channel,

505
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,999
they'll come, even on the television you'll see people,

506
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:21,500
they come down, "Haa."

507
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,458
I don't understand.

508
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,500
You'll never find any Indian doing that,

509
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:29,667
after all in that heat also, he'll never say that,

510
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:33,083
because you think, think, think too much, just think,

511
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:36,417
don't do anything about it.

512
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,999
Like you file, you see, make a file,

513
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:41,917
tomorrow is Mother's puja, all right,

514
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,999
we'll have this, this, this - filed it.

515
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:48,875
At the puja it is not there, why? It's in the file.

516
00:31:52,166 --> 00:32:00,999
And anything that is before your Realization,

517
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:06,417
like people have an idea,

518
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:10,999
Labor saving is a very great asset of the Western people.

519
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:06,542
like this how to avoid work, you see, labor saving.

520
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:12,667
So the labor saving how they will do.

521
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,999
Supposing, you say, "Please, telephone to such a person."

522
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,458
"Mother, I think he may not be there."

523
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:21,166
"Baba, you telephone and find out."

524
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:24,999
So the explanation comes from the brain,

525
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:29,500
it may not. So nothing can be achieved.

526
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:31,999
So first the labor saving was that

527
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:36,250
"Oh, this is anti-culture, we should be â€“

528
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,500
this is so bad, everything is so bad,

529
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:41,250
we should start a very natural life,

530
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,208
we should lead a very natural thing and that

531
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:47,959
we should become primitive," and all that.

532
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:53,999
From that if you grow in - from that area if you grow into Sahaja Yoga,

533
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,291
you become subtler.

534
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:01,542
So the subtler things that they become is this way:

535
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:05,999
that now as it is, you see,

536
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:11,500
"We should not do too much of everything, is too much, you see,

537
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,625
it is too much."

538
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:17,583
If you talk to somebody about Sahaja Yoga, they say,

539
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:19,999
"It's too much for me."

540
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:22,208
Hey, you have no brain or what is it?

541
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,792
What is too much? Can't take it?

542
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:28,000
"Oh it's too much."

543
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:31,667
It's a very common experience with Me,

544
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:35,083
that when I talk to people they would say, "It's too much."

545
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:38,667
I mean your brain, is it a limited brain

546
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:44,083
or what is it that you can't listen to Me what I am trying to tell you?

547
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:48,542
And once you start developing this kind of attitude,

548
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,667
the nourishment cannot reach you,

549
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:53,999
supposing the trees say, "Oh it's too much,"

550
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:58,083
then what are they going to do?

551
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,667
Nothing is too much.

552
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:05,667
"I have to grow, I have to take all the nourishment,

553
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:08,834
I have to become something,

554
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:11,999
I have to do such a lot.

555
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:12,999
What have I done?"

556
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:18,542
Nothing so far. Never be satisfied with yourself.

557
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:21,542
I mean, some people who saw My program

558
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:24,458
they were all shocked how Mother is going to do it.

559
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:30,083
I said, "I know I am going to do it, if I have to do it, I'll do it."

560
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:37,291
So this is what should be attitude:

561
00:34:37,417 --> 00:34:44,458
when you love Me I am your ideal. You must know that.

562
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:48,917
If you love Me, then what are you doing about it?

563
00:34:48,999 --> 00:35:01,458
I am your ideal. You have to reach My style,

564
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:07,750
otherwise Sahaja Yoga won't work out in these countries

565
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:14,417
which have taken to lethargy as a great culture.

566
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:17,083
I asked somebody, "What about your bathing,

567
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,500
why didn't you take bath?"

568
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:23,166
He said, "These days it is out of fashion to take bath."

569
00:35:23,792 --> 00:35:29,166
Everything seems to be out of fashion, whatever is in fashion is horrid.

570
00:35:29,709 --> 00:35:32,250
"It's very fashionable," is another thing people say,

571
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:34,417
"it's very fashionable,"

572
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:38,333
and whatever is fashionable looks so ugly to Me.

573
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:43,083
Now if you have to take to the Sahaj culture,

574
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:47,166
you have to know that we have to have a discipline in our life.

575
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:49,583
We have to have education, we have to have a place,

576
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:54,166
we have to have a position in the society.

577
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:56,959
Because we are not sitting in the Himalayas,

578
00:35:56,999 --> 00:36:00,999
somewhere lost in the Himalayas sitting there

579
00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:06,667
and just doing our Tapasya.

580
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:14,792
Tapasya is here where you live.

581
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:18,959
Otherwise if you say that "All right we have to go to Himalayas

582
00:36:18,999 --> 00:36:22,709
and there we have to do Tapasya in the cold winds.

583
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:24,458
Oh, that's very good."

584
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,583
Because that looks like something, you see,

585
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:29,750
you might have a name, or something like that.

586
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,792
But Tapasya is here,

587
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:34,333
the detachment has to be worked out here.

588
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,417
You get involved into all these things,

589
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:40,250
in a way sometimes surprises Me,

590
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:43,500
the amount of involvement you have

591
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:50,709
in the things which existed in gross form,

592
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:54,208
they have become subtler and you are still bound by them,

593
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:58,999
there's no freedom.

594
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:05,999
And that's why when you see something absurd happening,

595
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:08,792
you see something funny happening in Sahaja Yoga,

596
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:12,667
it's just the symptom of that thing becoming subtler

597
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:17,999
within us and its expressing itself.

598
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:20,917
Like sometimes you may not see fire

599
00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:27,999
but it exists and suddenly you find a blast.

600
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:34,834
So transformation of course means evolution,

601
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:35,999
it also means that whatever basis you had,

602
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:37,999
you have to evolve out of it.

603
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:46,834
Like a flower blossoming and then becoming the fruit,

604
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:52,291
but it has to drop out many things.

605
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:59,999
And then with the nature one has to see such a unison.

606
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:08,208
In the nature if you see, it sucks the water.

607
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:13,709
Then the water is evaporated by the sun.

608
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:22,999
Then it becomes a cloud and then the cloud waits,

609
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:25,542
because the leaves drop out.

610
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:32,542
In the winter time they nourish the tree with their nitrogen;

611
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:34,999
when the time is ready,

612
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:41,999
then these clouds pour down and again nourish this.

613
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:47,417
Such a complete balance is in the nature.

614
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:51,583
If it was not, I tell you they would, we would, have said,

615
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:56,291
"all bald headed lands here."

616
00:38:57,208 --> 00:39:02,250
If you go to any, any forest, any forest, it's so clean,

617
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:06,709
you never have any bad smell anywhere whatsoever.

618
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:09,999
There are animals, there are tigers, that, this â€“

619
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:12,709
never get any smell anywhere,

620
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:14,500
you never even get the smell of a tiger.

621
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:19,834
But if you put the tiger in a cage then he starts smelling,

622
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:23,250
he's so much bathed in the nature, he lives with the nature,

623
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:27,291
and in such balance.

624
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:30,792
It's such an understanding among all the animals, everything.

625
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:34,667
I don't know how they keep it so clean,

626
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:38,500
but as soon as you get some smell,

627
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:44,999
you will find out there must be some human being somewhere,

628
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:49,667
or some untidiness.

629
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:54,583
It's so organized how the leaves grow according to the sun's rays,

630
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:56,333
how they organize themselves,

631
00:39:56,458 --> 00:40:00,959
how they build up themselves.

632
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:04,834
So if you really have to get to the nature of Sahaja Yoga,

633
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:09,417
we should get all these blessings

634
00:40:09,542 --> 00:40:12,250
by which we should prosper.

635
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:19,208
Not, I mean in money and things, but in every way.

636
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:25,834
So it should not be a set of people who are just sort of parasites.

637
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:34,500
And I wish for you that you understand what I am saying today

638
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:37,999
and I request you, all of you,

639
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:41,000
to be alert and dynamic

640
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,291
and work it out.

641
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:45,583
Each single person has to come up.

642
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:49,041
It's not going to work out if you wear some saffron clothes

643
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:52,083
and go on singing "Hare Rama, Hare Krishna" on the street.

644
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:58,333
No. It's not going to work out.

645
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,500
Nor it is going to work out if you say,

646
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,999
"We are Sahaja Yogis, we are such people and this and that."

647
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:08,750
Nothing. You have to be something.

648
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:13,208
So on one side, the dynamism is to be used for yourself

649
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:18,999
and the dynamism is to be used for Sahaja Yoga.

650
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:24,542
You need not now worry about right-sidedness.

651
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:26,999
Is very common even in ...

652
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:29,834
This happened: I found in Holland

653
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:34,999
that I married one girl, very dynamic girl, to someone

654
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:38,500
and the husband said, "Mother, she doesn't help me."

655
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:39,999
I said, "Why?"

656
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:42,999
"Because I'm afraid I'll become right-sided."

657
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:47,166
I said, "But why did I marry you to this left-sided fellow?

658
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:49,792
That you become left-sided?"

659
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:51,667
Left-sided is a very good thing

660
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:54,542
because you don't have to do anything, just you have to say,

661
00:41:54,667 --> 00:42:03,709
"I don't want to become right-sided," that's all.

662
00:42:03,834 --> 00:42:06,750
But right-sidedness means you have to look,

663
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:09,834
you have to be alert, you have to be clever

664
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:14,999
and you have to know everything.

665
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:18,083
You'll sit in the sun, burn your skins,

666
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:20,667
but look at the sun.

667
00:42:20,792 --> 00:42:27,917
Are you on the sun line or on the moon line?

668
00:42:27,999 --> 00:42:33,999
So the swing of all the Western people is on the left hand side.

669
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:43,917
Drinking, pubs, like in 24 hours they sleep,

670
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:45,583
say maybe fourteen hours,

671
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:45,709
maybe eighteen hours,

672
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:51,041
rest of the time they drink, that's all.

673
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:55,458
We have one house being built next to us,

674
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:57,166
when we shifted there, they said,

675
00:42:57,291 --> 00:43:00,041
"This is practically finished now" - still finishing

676
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:02,333
and will take at least three years more maybe,

677
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:03,999
may never finish.

678
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:07,458
It's like the mathematics, you see, you have this

679
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:10,999
that there was a work and somebody came,

680
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:13,500
he did one tenth and ran away.

681
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:16,208
Then somebody came did one twentieth and ran away.

682
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,750
Then somebody came he did one fortieth and ran away.

683
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:20,999
When will the work finish? It will never finish,

684
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:24,999
with such running away people, never finish.

685
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:27,166
Same thing is Sahaja Yoga.

686
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,834
If you put mathematically,

687
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:31,166
Sahaja Yoga can never be established in America,

688
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:38,500
if you add up more and more of this kind of people.

689
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,834
So much is happening in this country,

690
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:42,583
but you have to see those people, you have to meet those people

691
00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:47,834
who are at the helm of affairs, who are the people who matter,

692
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:52,458
who are scientific, who are talking about something sensible.

693
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:57,041
You have to talk to them, get to them.

694
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:02,000
We don't need cinema actors and actresses,

695
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:05,834
but we need people who are dynamic.

696
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:07,583
And this may work out

697
00:44:07,709 --> 00:44:11,875
if you put your minds to it and we have something to show them.

698
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:16,709
I would say that Austria is one place

699
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:18,750
where Sahaja Yoga has worked very well,

700
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:24,208
Milan is another place and where most of them are professionals.

701
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:29,999
It's very surprising, in modern times we are living.

702
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:32,291
We are not living in those ancient times

703
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:36,500
where the Rishi Munis used to sit under a tree

704
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:41,500
and the kings used to come and touch their feet.

705
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:43,166
Is the other way round;

706
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:49,999
the Rishi Munis have to go and talk to the kings.

707
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:54,583
So when we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis

708
00:44:54,709 --> 00:44:56,667
we have to know that in a subtle way

709
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:58,542
we are still caught up into the webs of

710
00:44:58,667 --> 00:45:03,999
our own understanding about life. So, that we have to change.

711
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:07,709
Life for us is nothing but Sahaja Yoga

712
00:45:07,834 --> 00:45:17,625
and Sahaja Yoga is nothing but enlightening ourselves and others.

713
00:45:18,709 --> 00:45:22,999
So I hope you will listen to My lecture today,

714
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:25,999
you will take the tapes home and listen to them

715
00:45:25,999 --> 00:45:27,709
again and again.

716
00:45:27,834 --> 00:45:30,667
Also there's a warning from people that

717
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:37,959
"Mother, what they do is to take one tape for one center

718
00:45:37,999 --> 00:45:40,999
and everybody listens it and then finished."

719
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:46,792
Meaning, you all should have one tape each.

720
00:45:46,917 --> 00:45:49,291
Even that, people don't do.

721
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:51,999
Not only that, but now it might be after some time

722
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:58,999
only one, one tape in circulation in one country.

723
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:02,709
They circulate; say, today in New York, tomorrow in Boston,

724
00:46:02,834 --> 00:46:07,500
like that. You have to listen to it again and again.

725
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:09,999
Sit down with your paper and pencil,

726
00:46:09,999 --> 00:46:11,999
see for yourself what I am saying.

727
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:14,750
Every tape should be with you.

728
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:16,999
I mean, these horrible gurus' tapes

729
00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:21,000
you can hear them in every car, in every place,

730
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:23,999
everyone they have it.

731
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:28,959
And why is it Sahaja Yogis don't have any tapes with them?

732
00:46:28,999 --> 00:46:32,999
You can make copies.

733
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,917
But if you can get it free, they'll like to have.

734
00:46:37,999 --> 00:46:44,333
That's the first thing, what we can get free, cheaply, easily.

735
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:50,792
If you try to save money, the money tries to save itself.

736
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:57,458
It's a mutual understanding.

737
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:04,000
It's as simple as this: supposing you open only one door,

738
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:05,208
no air will come in.

739
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:08,083
You open the other door the air will start flowing.

740
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:12,625
It's a circulation.

741
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:16,750
All this can be your own knowledge too,

742
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,959
I need not say anything, this is all in your brains,

743
00:47:19,999 --> 00:47:23,000
only open out yourself, you are not free people.

744
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:24,750
If you are free like Me,

745
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:30,333
you'll see all these things coming from your own brains.

746
00:47:30,999 --> 00:47:35,250
Specially for America, really, as you know, I am working very hard

747
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:38,041
and I want to work it out because,

748
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:41,542
if America is not all right, My Vishuddhi is not going to be all right.

749
00:47:41,667 --> 00:47:45,999
It's going to trouble Me throughout.

750
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:51,208
So you have to take it up upon yourself.

751
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:57,417
I don't say, "Take the cross."

752
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:00,208
You don't have to sacrifice anything,

753
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:07,417
but you have to be just aware about what are we,

754
00:48:07,542 --> 00:48:11,041
what are we doing, where are we?

755
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:13,583
And on top of that,

756
00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:19,542
Sahaja Yogis think they are obliging Sahaja Yoga and Me too.

757
00:48:19,999 --> 00:48:24,917
This is something. It's to be explained this way:

758
00:48:24,999 --> 00:48:27,542
I don't need Sahaja Yoga, you need Sahaja Yoga

759
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:29,917
and everybody needs Sahaja Yoga.

760
00:48:29,999 --> 00:48:32,208
You had in this country people like,

761
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:34,750
I mean such great, great people you had

762
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:38,208
I need not mention - persons like Abraham Lincoln

763
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:44,458
who gave such great ideas to the whole world.

764
00:48:45,709 --> 00:48:48,041
Why not you people be great?

765
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:49,999
He was a realized soul, all right,

766
00:48:49,999 --> 00:48:57,000
but he didn't know anything about Ida, Pingala and Sushumna.

767
00:48:57,125 --> 00:49:01,917
Why can't you become great like him?

768
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:09,667
So on a Virata Puja we have to decide

769
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:12,999
that we are all going to express

770
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:18,542
the conception that was once the Virat

771
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:20,999
as reality in our lives.

772
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:27,999
This is what we have to pray from our heart.

773
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:32,667
And it's a very good occasion today to do that,

774
00:49:32,792 --> 00:49:36,542
because we are sitting in a place where there were

775
00:49:36,667 --> 00:49:43,333
so many of these aboriginal people, you call them, anything.

776
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:46,917
They were so sensible,

777
00:49:46,999 --> 00:49:50,709
as in America you say brass tacks, you see.

778
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:58,999
They knew the principle how to lead a real spiritual life.

779
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:03,542
They were very free people, extremely free

780
00:50:03,999 --> 00:50:07,667
and so detached.

781
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:09,999
So if you do not correct yourself,

782
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:12,333
then there will be a problem on collectivity.

783
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:14,000
If there's a problem in collectivity,

784
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:16,583
it will reflect on you,

785
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:19,750
because you are part and parcel of the whole.

786
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:22,709
If there's a problem in the whole being

787
00:50:22,834 --> 00:50:24,542
there's a problem for you.

788
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:26,417
And if there's a problem in one part,

789
00:50:26,542 --> 00:50:28,834
there's a problem for the whole being.

790
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:32,000
Even Roosevelt who was your president once said that

791
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:35,667
"Poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity everywhere."

792
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:40,166
He could see this point so clearly.

793
00:50:40,291 --> 00:50:42,458
You see, all these sayings show us

794
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:45,417
that this is a country of Virat,

795
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,999
where they talk of collectivity,

796
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:50,917
they have all the communications

797
00:50:50,999 --> 00:50:52,792
which are important.

798
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:54,999
Every sort of communication is important,

799
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:56,208
but for Sahaja Yogis

800
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:59,834
it has to be very subtle, very dynamic,

801
00:50:59,959 --> 00:51:01,917
very beautiful, very loving,

802
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:06,208
very impressive, magnetic.

803
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:10,709
Then only the communications will work.

804
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:14,999
There's no harm in wearing very nice dresses.

805
00:51:14,999 --> 00:51:20,208
There's no harm in wearing - nice doesn't mean expensive,

806
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:27,999
but means which are sensible, dignified.

807
00:51:27,999 --> 00:51:31,458
We have to build up our personalities,

808
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:40,333
that people should feel that "Oh, this is something, eh."

809
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:46,291
And your children will also learn from you.

810
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:49,083
There's no question of feeling that

811
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:49,792
you'll be driven into ego or anything,

812
00:51:49,999 --> 00:51:58,041
that's finished now, ego is finished here, there's no ego.

813
00:51:58,166 --> 00:52:02,750
What I find here is a justification

814
00:52:02,875 --> 00:52:04,000
for doing nothing

815
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:11,709
that we do not want to do anything because our ego will come up.

816
00:52:11,834 --> 00:52:18,667
Very clever.

817
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:25,542
So with all this one has to know

818
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:28,291
that we are selected people,

819
00:52:28,417 --> 00:52:31,709
we are chosen people of God.

820
00:52:31,834 --> 00:52:34,000
He must have selected us with some purpose,

821
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:37,709
otherwise there are so many people in this country.

822
00:52:37,834 --> 00:52:41,709
You are the foundation and you have to be solid people

823
00:52:41,834 --> 00:52:43,999
to be the foundation.

824
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:47,750
Must know our own glory,

825
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:50,959
our own speciality

826
00:52:50,999 --> 00:52:53,542
that why we are selected,

827
00:52:53,667 --> 00:52:56,500
of all the people why are we there?

828
00:52:56,625 --> 00:53:02,917
Then, what are we doing about it?

829
00:53:02,999 --> 00:53:04,999
Normal life you do see that way,

830
00:53:04,999 --> 00:53:08,291
like if somebody is selected for a post or something,

831
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:11,000
out of many, many things, "Oh must be something about me,

832
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:13,959
I must show my worth, I must show my value,

833
00:53:13,999 --> 00:53:15,999
I must show my work," you see,

834
00:53:15,999 --> 00:53:22,792
and he works hard to prove that the selection was good.

835
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:25,834
But in Sahaja Yoga it's the other way round,

836
00:53:25,959 --> 00:53:28,041
you take it for granted,

837
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:30,583
"Oh, we are something great."

838
00:53:30,709 --> 00:53:37,583
So now settle down with yourself - have a cup of tea.

839
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:45,542
I hope it has been understood why I am saying so,

840
00:53:45,667 --> 00:53:48,750
because I am really concerned about America.

841
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:50,999
So many negative forces are working here

842
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:55,999
and we have to improve.

843
00:53:57,083 --> 00:54:00,208
So many things such a big responsibility,

844
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:03,166
such a big country, such a vast country,

845
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:11,583
so much perversion, so much nonsensical ideologies,

846
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:14,917
I mean endless.

847
00:54:14,999 --> 00:54:20,834
Even if you get fifteen Gorbachevs, you cannot change this country.

848
00:54:21,667 --> 00:54:24,333
It has gone amuck.

849
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:26,999
Everybody's an individual,

850
00:54:26,999 --> 00:54:29,500
this mad place.

851
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:32,667
One Gorbachev can change that country

852
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:35,166
which has much more population.

853
00:54:35,291 --> 00:54:37,208
But no one can change this country

854
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:42,458
unless and until you people decide to do something about it.

855
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:46,583
So I'm told some people are frustrated

856
00:54:46,709 --> 00:54:49,333
because there are not so many Sahaja Yogis are coming,

857
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:51,792
but may be something wrong with you.

858
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:53,500
Maybe that you are not deep enough

859
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:58,875
and that you are not so much impressive.

860
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:03,417
You have to change your life style,

861
00:55:03,542 --> 00:55:11,333
you have to be smart people and spartan.

862
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:18,000
I hope, I hope again and again that after this Virata's Puja

863
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:22,166
you all will come up on the stage as great Viratas.

864
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,999
May God bless you all.
