1
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:38,519
I was told that we have a very beautiful place
for this puja and I was amazed how everything

2
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,169
is working out so beautifully for all of you.

3
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:45,739
You are all very lucky people I must say.

4
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:51,839
Moreover that this place was called as the
“fort of flowers” and now it was called

5
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:57,458
as a “fort of blood”, bloody fort.

6
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:02,918
But I think with all these flowers it should
become the “fort of flowers” again.

7
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:07,839
It’s a very, very beautiful place you have
come to.

8
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,738
The vibrations are also very good here.

9
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:17,818
I’ve been always wondering why Germany was
called as Germany.

10
00:08:17,818 --> 00:08:25,468
Germ, germ means sprouting.

11
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:30,798
Any germ of anything means the sprouting of
it.

12
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:35,189
Germinate means to sprout.

13
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:47,959
The sprouting of Sahaja Yoga as I’ve told
you many a times before once taken by Germans

14
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:54,879
will be reaching its epitome, its highest
point.

15
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:02,109
We have had lots of ups and downs, doesn’t
matter.

16
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:14,809
It’s a difficult place and now we have started
really the germination in a proper way.

17
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:22,309
Yesterday I saw the whole sky was filled with
color and light.

18
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:25,139
As you know that vibrations have light.

19
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:37,310
It’s very light flickering, very small light,
each particle of vibration has and you can

20
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,199
see that.

21
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:47,869
But when there are too many, then they can
be caught up by your cameras.

22
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:54,628
But yesterday I think the clouds got vibrated.

23
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:57,229
And is a very great thing to get the clouds
vibrated.

24
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:01,789
If the clouds are vibrated, the rain will
be vibrated.

25
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:07,699
If the rain is vibrated, the land will be
vibrated.

26
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:21,158
All the crops that are to be germinated will
be vibrated too, so when it goes into the

27
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:25,628
body of human beings, they’ll get also vibrations.

28
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:30,548
Is the best way now is to vibrate the clouds,
I think, if you have to have many more people

29
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,388
for Sahaja Yoga.

30
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:39,638
That’s the idea came into My mind last night
that why not vibrate all the clouds, that’s

31
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:42,718
the best way.

32
00:10:42,718 --> 00:11:00,408
Moreover the vibrations are very tiny bit,
with one point going into a half circle normally.

33
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:11,679
This half circle then combines to make “Aum”
sometimes, sometimes it makes a chain, sometimes

34
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,768
it gathers together to make crosses.

35
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:27,599
But the basic thing about them is that they
can think, and think very fast, much faster

36
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,029
than human beings can think.

37
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,578
And they are extremely collective, extremely
collective.

38
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:43,408
So they move together, thinking the same way,
understanding the same way in an absolute

39
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:55,139
manner and work out the whole thing in a very
beautiful silent way that you cannot even

40
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:56,139
feel.

41
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:02,519
Now the Kundalini rising, as you have done,
must be a mystery for all of you that how

42
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:08,649
can you with your hands raise the Kundalini,
and you must be thinking that, “This must

43
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:15,489
be some sort of a special power Mother has
given us that we can put our hands to anybody’s

44
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:20,829
Kundalini, it rises, then stops at a place
when there is problem and then again it rises.”

45
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:27,399
Now it’s nothing a mystery for you.

46
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:33,949
You have got now within you the power.

47
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:43,359
Like you can move the water, you can move
the matter, you can move all those things.

48
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:49,599
Animals cannot do that and even if they can
do little bit here and there, they cannot

49
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:52,689
transform it for their use.

50
00:12:52,689 --> 00:13:01,639
For example, you see the nice brass here,
you see nice silver there, there’s a little

51
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,849
Ganesha sitting there.

52
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:11,919
All these have been transformed from something
that is dead, which animals cannot do.

53
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:20,579
As you become the master of living work – now
you are the masters of living work now, not

54
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:21,659
of the dead.

55
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:32,209
So the living force you can manage and mould
it and use it for your own purpose.

56
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:38,099
But the most surprising thing is that you
are not even aware of it, that you are doing

57
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:39,099
it.

58
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:44,919
Like when you are doing, say a little elephant
like that, you are aware and you know that

59
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,849
you are doing something great.

60
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:51,139
And you will tell, “Oh, I have made such
and such thing, such a nice place I have done.”

61
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:56,319
You’ll be conscious of it because you have
got ego.

62
00:13:56,319 --> 00:14:01,959
But when you are giving Realization to people,
you are not aware, because you have no ego.

63
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:07,719
And what you say, “Mother, it’s not coming
up, see it’s just catching on Vishuddhi,

64
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:09,809
it’s not working out.”

65
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:14,199
You start speaking in third person – you
don’t say, “I can’t do it” or “I

66
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:15,199
have done it.”

67
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,199
“It’s worked out.”

68
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:21,019
Only when it’s worked out, I see your faces
and I know it’s done.

69
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:27,339
So you are not even aware of it, you are not
even conscious of it and there’s no ego

70
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:28,339
about it.

71
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:31,559
You don’t take any credit for that, you
just feel joyous.

72
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:38,749
Like so many people came for your workshop
– “Oh, it was so great, Mother.”

73
00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:40,599
What was great was you.

74
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:44,269
It was you who was doing all the job.

75
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:47,909
You were working it out but you don’t feel
that way.

76
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:54,539
The reason is that you are now working in
a way that we call as akarma.

77
00:14:54,539 --> 00:15:00,469
Akarma is that when you do something but you
do not feel you are doing something.

78
00:15:00,469 --> 00:15:04,509
When you are not conscious of it, that is
akarma.

79
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:09,799
When you are doing something, and you think
that you are doing this work, that work, that

80
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,799
thing, then it is a karma.

81
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:15,389
But now the karma has become an akarma, not
that you are not doing anything.

82
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:22,469
You are doing so many things but you do not
feel that you are doing it because you have

83
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:27,259
now doing been doing akarma and all living
work is akarma.

84
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:34,719
Like the Mother Earth, She sprouts seeds – She
is not aware of it.

85
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:41,589
In the same way you people are raising the
Kundalini, you are not aware of it.

86
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:45,999
And when you are not aware of it, you don’t
even want to think, “How it is happening?

87
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:50,939
See me, a human being raising a hand like
this definitely the Kundalini rises, I see

88
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:52,349
it comes out of the head.

89
00:15:52,349 --> 00:15:54,929
It happens, I see this, it’s a fact.

90
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:59,259
Then how is it that this is happening?

91
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,489
What is the process?

92
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:03,749
What is the procedure?

93
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:05,958
How it has worked?

94
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,989
Did I make any mistakes?”

95
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:10,349
You never think like that.

96
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:13,109
“Did I do it in a wrong manner?”

97
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:14,109
You don’t think.

98
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:16,699
Sir, just you start – raise the Kundalini.

99
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:22,639
You just don’t bother to find out, “Have
I given myself a bandhan or not?

100
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,269
Have I seen the gentleman what his vibrations
are like?”

101
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:28,789
No, you just go ahead, raise your hands, yes.

102
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:34,779
You are quite aware of one thing: that you
are a realized soul and that you can raise

103
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:36,409
the Kundalini.

104
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:40,099
Yesterday I saw so many Sahaja Yogis walked
in.

105
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,909
I said, “Now come along, give them Realization.

106
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:49,359
Just stood there, did like this, did like
that – finished.

107
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:54,199
You did not even think you have done such
a great living work, that you have raised

108
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:55,199
their Kundalini.

109
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,629
Not only that, but it will transform them.

110
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:01,389
It will give them a new life.

111
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:05,269
There will be some special people, as you
are.

112
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:09,589
You are not even aware that you are some special
people.

113
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,039
Ego has vanished.

114
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,099
So now you don’t think that you are doing
anything, you think, “It’s Mother is doing

115
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,099
everything.”

116
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:22,439
Even then they give big, big speeches, they
say, “Mother, I never used to speak, I didn’t

117
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,289
know what was speech.

118
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:33,019
And now I have become a great speaker, it’s
You, You who is doing it.”

119
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:40,619
This feeling comes because there is no ego
any more left.

120
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:47,359
Now if you see in the water, if you put a
drop it becomes an ocean, no doubt.

121
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,959
But it’s not aware of it that it has become
an ocean, it moves with the ocean.

122
00:17:51,959 --> 00:18:00,799
But supposing you see a fish -a fish is free.

123
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,729
If she wants, she can move this way, she can
move that way, she can jump up, she can drink

124
00:18:06,729 --> 00:18:11,429
the water, she can do what she likes.

125
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:15,849
But a drop cannot, drop has to be part and
parcel of the whole.

126
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:20,339
So that was the intermediary stage when you
were animals.

127
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:26,119
Animals were under Paasha, under the bandhan
of God.

128
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:30,529
So they were doing exactly what was to be
done.

129
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:35,729
Then you became human beings, where you had
complete freedom to use it as you liked.

130
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:38,809
If you wanted to go heaven, go to heaven.

131
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:41,660
If you want to go to hell, you can go to hell.

132
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,508
It’s all are open to you.

133
00:18:43,508 --> 00:18:59,349
But now after becoming realized souls, you
have become absolutely free people.

134
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:05,689
But in that freedom, you feel Me being there.

135
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:06,689
Now what is this?

136
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:14,459
Am I trying to tie you up with something or
am I giving you some chains, or am I guiding

137
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:20,948
you, or am I all the time sort of a person
with a gun behind you, “Do this, otherwise

138
00:19:20,948 --> 00:19:22,269
this will happen.”?

139
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:24,419
That is not so.

140
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:32,579
So what is this new thing that is happening
to Sahaja Yogis, it’s to be understood fully.

141
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:40,179
The new thing is like this, like a fish goes
everywhere, does everything, but has no discretion;

142
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:48,239
doesn’t know which way to go, what to do,
sometimes get caught up into the – into

143
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:51,969
the net of a fisherman.

144
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:56,249
It can be eaten up by another big fish.

145
00:19:56,249 --> 00:19:58,669
It can be destroyed anytime.

146
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:05,749
It may just crawl onto the shore and get finished.

147
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:10,719
So the fish has no discretion.

148
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:15,198
But it has some innate knowledge to save itself
from dangers.

149
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:22,719
Now you don’t have any innate knowledge
about it – how to save yourself from dangers,

150
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:25,029
how to save yourselves from troubles.

151
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:30,159
No innate knowledge like that – that you
are cautious, you shouldn’t walk this way,

152
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,149
you shouldn’t go like this, you shouldn’t
give vibrations to somebody, you should not

153
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,149
treat somebody.

154
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:37,019
No, that’s not there.

155
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:43,919
Innately you don’t have this knowledge,
that we should try to save ourselves, we should

156
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:50,389
go from the right side, not from the left
side, it would be inauspicious, not so much.

157
00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:52,839
Still you always do right things.

158
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:58,809
Whichever time you will choose will be the
right auspicious time.

159
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:03,059
You don’t have to consult books on that.

160
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:13,019
Like once it happened in Lonavala, we had
a puja, and it was to be at 10 o’clock as

161
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,559
it was here.

162
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,529
I wouldn’t go for My bath for quite some
time and they were quite upset – “Mother,

163
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:22,529
what’s the matter?”

164
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:23,529
I said.

165
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:27,099
“It’s all right, let’s go ahead and
see” … was talking here, there, there,

166
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:30,839
there… then I went for My bath at about
11 o’clock.

167
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:39,309
When I come back it was 12 o’clock, the
sun had gone to the other side.

168
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:42,599
So they said, er … they were little upset.

169
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:48,169
I said, “Now, bring the panchar” – the
one which where all the timings are written

170
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:49,519
about the moon.

171
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,179
So till 11 o’clock there was amavasya.

172
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,789
Amavasya is the day when there is no moon
in the sky.

173
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:06,568
So I can’t take my bath in amavasya and
you cannot have puja otherwise, so I had to

174
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:07,568
wait.

175
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:08,568
They were amazed.

176
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:11,419
They said, “We had consulted the panchar.”

177
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:13,639
I said, “Which one?”

178
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:21,378
And you see, they saw, they were surprised
that how is it that Mother could tell about

179
00:22:21,378 --> 00:22:23,579
amavasya and this and that.

180
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:29,289
Because the discretion, the knowledge of discretion,
is built within you.

181
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:37,929
So whatever you do, whatever way you work
it out, is built-in with you.

182
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:40,139
You know how to do it.

183
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:45,959
For example, for a human being, if you prick
him with a pin, immediately his hand will

184
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:46,959
lift it.

185
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:49,059
Who has told him to do that?

186
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:50,639
Who has taught him to do that?

187
00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:57,239
No, in his consciousness it is built that
once you are pricked, immediately your hand

188
00:22:57,239 --> 00:23:01,438
will go out, automatically with a reflex action.

189
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:08,948
So the reflex action to auspiciousness, reflex
action to your saving, reflex action to everything,

190
00:23:08,948 --> 00:23:11,459
is built-in within you.

191
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:15,819
And once you become a Sahaja Yogi, immediately
you will start giving yourself a bandhan,

192
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:17,499
you’ll start giving others a bandhan.

193
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:22,979
You don’t have to think about it, a reflex
action, you will do whatever you will do,

194
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:24,329
will be auspicious.

195
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:27,169
Whatever you will do, will be beautiful.

196
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:29,979
Whatever you’ll ask, will be beautiful.

197
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:36,369
Like this place you got it and people are
amazed – how do we get it?

198
00:23:36,369 --> 00:23:39,889
But in the beginning you have to develop,
you have to mature.

199
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:44,579
Unless and until you are matured, you do not
get that discretion.

200
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:50,149
Like when we were trying to get a place in
London, I went with some Sahaja Yogis to find

201
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:51,149
out the place.

202
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:53,429
Now all kinds of funny places they were liking.

203
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:57,999
I said, “The vibrations are so bad, these
people are not feeling any vibrations or anything.”

204
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:02,129
I wouldn’t even get in the place, I’d
say, “No, no, no, no this is no good.”

205
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:03,599
They said, “No, this has character, this
has that.”

206
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,309
I said, “This character all that doesn’t
count with Me, you see.

207
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:11,029
So they said, “But Mother, how are we going
to get a good place and…”

208
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:12,379
I said, “We’ll get it.

209
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:13,669
[And you…]

210
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:23,719
I was traveling by a plane, in the plane I
opened a magazine and there I found Shudy

211
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:24,889
Camp.

212
00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:30,889
When I went back, I said, “Now this is the
place for us, let’s go and have a look.”

213
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:33,988
And there it was, and we found such a beautiful
place.

214
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:41,539
So, we should allow, see, things to work out,
have patience, things will work out automatically

215
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:46,399
because now the whole of the cosmos is with
us.

216
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:50,659
The whole of the discretion of the cosmos
is with us.

217
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:54,579
The vibrations that think are there.

218
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:58,649
The vibrations that guide are with us.

219
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:01,889
The vibrations that organize are with us.

220
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:03,439
Let them organize us.

221
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:10,549
We are playing into their hands by which we
are not bound, but we are helped.

222
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:14,459
Like supposing you have a baby, you have to
look after the baby.

223
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:18,669
But if there’s somebody, she says, “All
right, let me look after your baby.”

224
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:19,949
She says, “All right.”

225
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:22,459
Then you go to sleep.

226
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:26,089
There’s somebody who says, “All right,
don’t you worry, I’ll make a nice bed

227
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:27,229
for you.”

228
00:25:27,229 --> 00:25:28,229
So he says, “All right.”

229
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:29,749
So they make a nice bed for him.

230
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:34,199
Then you sleep there, there’s somebody to
cover you, nicely you are covered.

231
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:39,869
Then they say, “All right, you have to now
go for your bath -see the bath’s ready for

232
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:42,139
you, come along have your bath.”

233
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:46,579
Then you want to have your puja -“All right,
there’s a nice place for you, come along

234
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:47,579
have this.”

235
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,589
You want to have an ashram?

236
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,919
“All right, there’s a nice place for you
available, have it.”

237
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,139
So it is not that you are bound by them.

238
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:57,319
This is the point I am trying to make.

239
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:02,139
But you are invited, you are treated with
great respect and regard and everybody at

240
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:03,199
your service.

241
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:07,339
You say, “Mother, You come in my head”,
I’ll come in your head.

242
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:09,309
You say, “Come in my heart”, I’ll come
in your heart.

243
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:12,749
You say, “Come in my hands”, I’ll come
in your hands.

244
00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:19,869
So the whole of the cosmos is at your service
as if you are on the stage now, doing the

245
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,809
job for Me.

246
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:25,039
Now to think that you are under bondage is
a wrong thing.

247
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:32,250
There’s no bondage, on the contrary the
people who are ganas, who are angels, who

248
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:37,899
are deities, are anxious to do whatever is
possible to please you, to keep you happy.

249
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:45,989
If you say, “Now the Kundalini has to raise”,
all right they are all there to help you.

250
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:51,319
Anything you want can be done, but first of
all what you need is maturity.

251
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:57,249
And for maturity, one has to understand that
there is a culture of the spirit.

252
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:06,249
As we have human cultures, we have culture
of the spirit which must be imbibed.

253
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:17,319
The culture of the spirit is to be imbibed.

254
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:27,279
If you go according to the culture of the
spirit, then you cannot have problems, and

255
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,009
the foremost thing in the culture of spirit
is that you must respect yourself because

256
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:36,289
you are an yogi.

257
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:43,169
Second thing is you must respect other yogi,
because they are yogis.

258
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:51,029
Like I have told you before in Ganapatipule,
there was one tailor, Namadeva, who was a

259
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:59,819
saint and he went to see another one who was
just a potter.

260
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:06,919
And the potter was mixing the mud with water
with his feet, he was working there when Namadeva

261
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,809
went and saw him.

262
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:16,829
He saw him and what he says, “Nirgunachya
bheti alo sagunashi”, meaning “I came

263
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:23,119
to see here formless, the vibrations, the
Chaitanya.

264
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,119
Formless – nirgun.

265
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:29,619
I came to see a nirgun, meet nirguna [formless]
but here it is in sagun [form].

266
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:33,369
You are the one who is in form of that chaitanya.”

267
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:39,968
What a place, just think: one Sahaja Yogi
saying to another, “Oh God, I just came

268
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:47,719
here to meet the nirguna, the nirachara, and
whom do I meet here is the saguna, is the…

269
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:57,439
in the form, in the form, in you I see nothing
but Chaitanya.

270
00:28:57,439 --> 00:29:03,769
That is the, that is the respect of the another
yogi or understanding.

271
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:11,789
Namadeva was an ordinary tailor and was not
a Brahmin, so he was not treated very well

272
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:20,669
by other Brahmins, and he had to go to Punjab,
or it was said that he was called to Punjab,

273
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:25,399
and he went to Punjab where Guru Nanaka saw
him.

274
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:31,219
And Guru Nanak said that a great saint has
come to us.

275
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:36,309
So He kept him with Him, and He said, “You’d
better learn Punjabi because here the people

276
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:43,579
don’t understand Marathi so learn Punjabi
and make your poems in Punjabi language.”

277
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:46,839
And he started making poems in Punjabi language.

278
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:49,879
Now I’ve got Namadeva’s Gatha, so big
is that his book.

279
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:57,310
Half of it is all Punjabi language and then
the poems he makes are so beautiful, they

280
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:01,019
are sung in the Guru Granth Sahib they have
in the temple.

281
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:08,679
You know in all these big temples of gurudwaras
of the Sikhs, they have Guru Granth Sahib.

282
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:16,859
There the Namadeva is occupying at least one-tenth
of the Guru Granth Sahib and there’s also

283
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:23,889
Jannabai, another maid-servant who was working
with this Namdev, her poems are also there.

284
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:29,819
So how they were respected by each other and
how they understood each other was something

285
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:31,119
so great.

286
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,559
But now, it is just the other way around.

287
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:43,079
We, the people who are false, who are wrong
type of people, who are making money out of

288
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:49,968
God, who are deceiving people, who are bringing
all wrath and also all the negativity to this

289
00:30:49,968 --> 00:30:55,759
world, to destroy this world, are respected
by common people.

290
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:02,559
But the Sahaja Yogis must respect another
Sahaja Yogi, till he is a Sahaja Yogi.

291
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,159
As long as he is a Sahaja Yogi he must be
respected and understood, is very important.

292
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:15,129
This is the culture of the spirit, in that
we respect all those who are spiritually higher.

293
00:31:15,129 --> 00:31:20,999
Like talking about God, we cannot say things
which are not proper.

294
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:26,079
Like we cannot say that God is mischievous,
we cannot say.

295
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,699
We are saints.

296
00:31:28,699 --> 00:31:31,119
We have to be very respectful to God.

297
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:37,419
Any place which is sort of representing God
also must be respected.

298
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:43,529
Everything that is godly must be respected,
because that is the culture of the spirit.

299
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:59,399
It respects all that is godly, all that is
auspicious, all that is beautiful.

300
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:02,429
In the culture, we do not see superficial
things.

301
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:10,348
In this culture, we do not yield to anything
because it is expensive or it is with such

302
00:32:10,348 --> 00:32:13,449
pomp and show or publicity.

303
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:21,529
What we see in this culture is how far it
is joy-giving.

304
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:29,359
Even a small betel nut if somebody gives Me
with love, I’ll keep it with Me.

305
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:34,449
And even if you give Me diamonds without love,
I have no value for them.

306
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:38,989
They will be lost or they’ll be finished
– good for nothing.

307
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:48,569
So the love that you put into everything makes
you a Sahaja Yogi.

308
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:56,139
How you talk to each other, how you deal with
each other, how you look after with each other.

309
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:59,869
How you communicate your love in a pure manner.

310
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:05,189
Say a Sahaja Yogi should think, “Oh, I must
take this present for other Sahaja Yogis.

311
00:33:05,189 --> 00:33:10,869
I’m going there, then that I’ll meet that
Sahaja Yogi, he’ll be there and he’ll

312
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:14,129
be there and…” just like your brothers,
see.

313
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:19,359
“Ah, after such a long time I’ll be meeting
him, and it will be such a nice thing to meet

314
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:26,949
him and talk to him and enjoy him and sometimes
also pull his legs and have a nice fun at

315
00:33:26,949 --> 00:33:27,949
him.”

316
00:33:27,949 --> 00:33:37,299
But the whole culture is of love, and if you
do not have that sense of love, if you are

317
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:45,169
a dry person, or a morose person, or an unhappy
person, then remember you are not a Sahaja

318
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:46,169
Yogi.

319
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:55,279
A Sahaja Yogi has to be a smiling, enjoying
personality, making others happy.

320
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:01,069
That’s the main attitude, main concern should
be.

321
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:08,149
Next time I’ll be speaking about the spiritual
culture in Diwali when you’ll be there but

322
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:09,149
this is the beginning.

323
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:13,859
I have started talking about the new culture
that we have to accept.

324
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:18,249
In expressing our love we should not be ashamed.

325
00:34:18,249 --> 00:34:22,939
We should not feel shy about it at all, we
are expressing our love and love must be expressed.

326
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:28,699
There’s no harm in expressing our love.

327
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:33,799
But it happens that in the beginning we feel
little shy, we are conditioned, how to express,

328
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:39,019
people will misunderstand and they will think
that we are wrong type of people.

329
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:41,859
No, we are special people.

330
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:46,819
We have to make the whole world, they are
not going to make us.

331
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:53,749
We have to create the new world and they have
to follow us, we are not going to follow them.

332
00:34:53,749 --> 00:34:59,549
We are the makers of kings and we are the
makers of queens and we are the makers of

333
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:01,339
everything.

334
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:04,199
So we have to work it out that way.

335
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:11,629
We don’t have to bow to their ways and methods
but we have to patronize and look after them

336
00:35:11,629 --> 00:35:18,458
when they come to us first, try to treat them
as if a father would treat a son, and then

337
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:25,149
bring him up, mould them and give them love
and make them understand that we are people

338
00:35:25,149 --> 00:35:30,429
of a very, very different domain, of a different
style.

339
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:37,879
We are absolutely free people and are being
entertained by the Divine, are being looked

340
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:43,679
after by the Divine, are being helped and
decorated by the Divine.

341
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:51,679
Such a privileged place we have, so let us
be of that dignity and of that morality, that

342
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,169
we stand up to that.

343
00:35:53,169 --> 00:35:55,939
How can we do something wrong to insult ourself?

344
00:35:55,939 --> 00:36:00,349
We cannot, we are yogijanas and we have to
be like yogis.

345
00:36:00,874 --> 00:36:03,164
May God bless you all!
