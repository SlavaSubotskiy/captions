1
00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:11,182
Today we are going to worship Shri Ganesh.

2
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:22,194
I think I have told you a lot about Him and
His nature,

3
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:27,515
but still so many of us have not yet
realized

4
00:00:27,716 --> 00:00:33,044
what are His powers, and what He wants.

5
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:46,202
First and foremost thing is that to respect
Shri Ganesha

6
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:52,343
is to understand the importance
of chastity.

7
00:00:52,544 --> 00:01:00,628
Chastity is not only for the women, it is
more for the men to observe.

8
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:07,510
If you have self-respect, in the real sense
of the word,

9
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:11,357
 you will take to chastity without
any difficulties.

10
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:19,801
But if you have no self-respect, then you
run after something which is very low,

11
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:25,713
of a very degrading quality.

12
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:32,567
So it’s very important that chastity must
be respected,

13
00:01:32,768 --> 00:01:38,981
must be understood, and must be imbibed.

14
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:47,951
This habit of not observing the proper
protocol

15
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:55,479
of the chastity develops from childhood,
and we have to be very careful,

16
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:04,798
when we are in a Ganesha state we should
not take to such horrible things.

17
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:09,058
I don’t know from where people get
the ideas.

18
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:18,055
As you see today in the whole world there’s
a crisis of chastity.

19
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,879
In the West specially, we have heard
of so many cases of child abuse.

20
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,102
In a temple of God one should not even take
the name

21
00:02:31,303 --> 00:02:35,658
of this dirty disease which has grabbed
the people.

22
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:39,237
But in India we have never heard of it,
we don’t know.

23
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:44,891
Of course, some of the men are very, very
ruined people

24
00:02:45,092 --> 00:02:50,969
and they can’t help it, unless and until
they are put into jail.

25
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:58,039
But for a Sahaja yogi it is very important
to look after our chastities.

26
00:02:58,248 --> 00:03:01,411
As I told you yesterday, it is not
necessary

27
00:03:01,596 --> 00:03:05,619
to find a girl for yourself or a boy
for yourself.

28
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,960
It’s also against the rules of chastity.

29
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:17,380
I’m not saying that you should allow only
your parents to decide,

30
00:03:17,581 --> 00:03:23,424
but let the Sahaja Yoga decide, because
you are Sahajis.

31
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:33,870
You are born after the image of Ganesha,
who ultimately becomes Christ.

32
00:03:34,071 --> 00:03:40,019
So what should be your attitude towards
chastity is very important.

33
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,867
The most important thing, that

34
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:55,319
if we get ruined on our chastity level
then Sahaja Yoga is very, very difficult,

35
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,910
and it doesn’t give you that blessing
as you should have.

36
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:07,847
You saw yesterday people from Romania
and also from Ukraine

37
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,945
were singing so beautifully.

38
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:18,613
One of the reasons is that basically they
are very, very humble people.

39
00:04:18,814 --> 00:04:24,848
They are humbled down, so much so that
they have given up nonsensical ideas

40
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:29,422
about sex life and all that.

41
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:37,715
So the humility will teach you that you are
not having your self-respect.

42
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:44,257
In the Islam they have stressed a very big
importance on chastity, very much.

43
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,518
And this was gone to such an extent that
Mohammed Sahib said that you can have

44
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:58,128
five wives or four wives, but you don’t
have women who are prostitutes.

45
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:06,905
Once this chastity starts leaving us,
we don’t mind anything under the sun.

46
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:15,273
We have seen results of that working out
in many people who are very highly placed.

47
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:19,795
And these highly placed people think that
they are something great,

48
00:05:19,996 --> 00:05:25,853
and they can overcome the binding of Jesus
Christ and they can do what they like,

49
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:32,784
go on misbehaving with women who are
under them.

50
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:38,034
They may do it secretly, they may do it
any way, but Ganesha watches that,

51
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:42,483
and He punishes them for what they are
doing.

52
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:46,516
It’s a terrible thing to go into these kind
of ventures,

53
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:50,189
which are not the field of Sahaja yogis.

54
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,030
Sahaja yogis have to first of all steady
their eyes,

55
00:05:54,231 --> 00:06:02,925
because it is concerned with the power
of Jesus Christ.

56
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:07,219
But in all the Christian nations I have
seen people have wandering eyes –

57
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:13,563
very surprising, when Christ is their
leader, they worship Christ,

58
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:20,049
go to church, sing the praise of Christ,
and they have wandering eyes all over.

59
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:27,790
These wandering eyes cannot be
representative of the chastity of Christ.

60
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:43,395
Now the second point is that the power
of Ganesha can only be manifested

61
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:48,861
if you are wise, because He is the giver
of wisdom.

62
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:53,671
Now people don’t understand what is wisdom
is – this is the big problem.

63
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:57,315
Intelligence, so-called, is not wisdom.

64
00:06:57,521 --> 00:07:01,491
It can make you a very cunning, very
aggressive,

65
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:05,523
and sometimes very subtle person

66
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:09,964
who can go on deceiving people, telling
lies, doing all kinds of things,

67
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:16,368
and believing in themselves that they are
very, very successful.

68
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:22,209
Success is never the criteria of a Sahaja
yogi.

69
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:32,323
Success in Sahaja Yoga means very subtle
surrendering of oneself to Sahaja Yoga.

70
00:07:32,524 --> 00:07:40,107
That is seldom to be found unless and until
you meditate every day.

71
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:43,447
It’s very important that you must meditate.

72
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:47,642
Those who do not meditate will be lost
to Sahaja Yoga,

73
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:53,449
because wisdom can only grow through
your inner inspiration.

74
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:57,695
You can have this inner inspiration

75
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:04,558
only if the power of Shri Ganesha
manifests.

76
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,237
He is the giver of your wisdom.

77
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:18,490
In the wisdom what you do is to find
solutions, solutions which are peaceful,

78
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:23,629
which are satisfying, which are soothing.

79
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,569
He is the one who takes you to task also.

80
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,929
Like yesterday I was told there was
a whirlwind, and many people had to suffer

81
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:40,102
little bit because of the wind that came
and blew off your tents.

82
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:44,437
There’s no need to have tents in this
climate, what is the need?

83
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:49,969
I don’t understand. But they cannot live
without a tent, you see.

84
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,083
I can sleep outside very nicely,
on the street also.

85
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:57,666
So there’s no need to sort of fuss about
all these things

86
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:02,689
and bring the whole household here,
there’s no need.

87
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:07,447
We should not be afraid of discomfort.

88
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:13,200
If you want to have a very comfortable life
and you can’t suffer any discomfort,

89
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:18,554
you are no good for Sahaja Yoga. In olden
days people used to go to Himalayas,

90
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:23,057
stand on one leg, pray to God, and they
didn’t give realization,

91
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:27,452
they couldn’t get realization; while you
all have got realization.

92
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:35,403
So one should not try to make oneself very,
very sort of a lordly person.

93
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:38,155
There is no need to care for comfort.

94
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,222
I can live in comfort and I can live in any
way, at this age also.

95
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:50,041
So what you have to do is to, not
to practice, I say, asceticism

96
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:53,353
but to become an ascetic.

97
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:58,511
Practicing means trouble, but if you just
become an ascetic from within,

98
00:09:58,712 --> 00:10:04,435
then you don’t bother about these little,
little things here and there.

99
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:09,529
But our style is still molded by outside
world.

100
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:16,656
We haven’t got our own world, then we are
going as the fashion is.

101
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:21,667
And once you start going with the fashion,
the wisdom disappears.

102
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:26,012
I never tell anybody that you don’t have
this fashion or that fashion or anything.

103
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:30,177
It’s your wisdom which will teach you.
Wisdom will teach you

104
00:10:30,378 --> 00:10:35,501
how to regulate yourself, because you have
come here to ascend,

105
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:44,880
to achieve a very special place
in the realm of spirituality.

106
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:51,205
I must stress again on the power of wisdom.

107
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:54,793
Before doing anything you should just
appeal to your wisdom

108
00:10:54,994 --> 00:10:59,024
and find out if it is wise to be like that.

109
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:04,038
With this practice you will reduce
your temper, absolutely.

110
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:11,757
You’ll reduce your lust, you’ll reduce
your guilt very much;

111
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:15,606
because once you start understanding that
there’s no wisdom

112
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:19,927
in feeling guilty, your guilt will
disappear.

113
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:26,511
Also the worst thing is that we have
a great desire to have this, have that,

114
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:32,690
and to indulge into all kinds of greed.

115
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:38,467
This greed becomes zero as soon as you
understand

116
00:11:38,668 --> 00:11:41,307
wisely that there’s no need.

117
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:46,348
Otherwise all the time you’ll be thinking
about yourself, about your health,

118
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:52,319
about your children, about your house,
whatever is supposed to be yours.

119
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,094
But the death proves that there’s nothing
belongs to you.

120
00:11:57,295 --> 00:12:01,677
You have come alone, and you have to go
alone.

121
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:07,421
This is the wisdom which is to be imbibed.
You cannot practice it,

122
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:12,627
you cannot force it, but it’s to be imbibed
through your spirituality.

123
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:16,196
Then the greatest thing that happens is
the joy,

124
00:12:16,397 --> 00:12:21,896
joy of the dancing of Shri Ganesh.

125
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:28,817
Like a child you see Him dancing; how
joyous He feels, and you also feel.

126
00:12:29,018 --> 00:12:34,771
In the same way, a little child being born
within you,

127
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:38,820
and you start behaving like a small child.

128
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:46,550
Normally it has no sense of lust, greed,
nothing. It knows how to share.

129
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:51,893
So this is the position, we say, that you
become a gana –

130
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:58,938
the army of Shri Ganesh, they are ganas
and they are very powerful.

131
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:03,397
And they do all the work of the world,
they live in this world,

132
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:09,254
but all their source of energy is from
the Divine.

133
00:13:09,631 --> 00:13:14,219
So Shri Ganesha is an Omkara.

134
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,587
He is the first created deity
by the Goddess,

135
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:25,972
because He is auspiciousness. So, first
auspiciousness is created for our good.

136
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:32,506
We are auspicious because of Shri Ganesha.
Some people, if they are in the house

137
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:37,579
they create problems. They are always
creating problems out of nothing.

138
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:42,338
They are not auspicious people. Those
who are peacemakers,

139
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:49,253
those who are loving are the ones who are
blessed by Shri Ganesha.

140
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:56,377
What is the wisdom in fighting? You should
find out, what is the wisdom in fighting?

141
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:00,605
Why are you fighting, for what things?
For small, small things,

142
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:04,760
 things that you can yourself correct?
Why should you fight?

143
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:09,236
If you have a fighting nature, that means
Ganesha is against you,

144
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:14,238
is your Ganesha is sleeping; that power is
not with you, there is no wisdom in it.

145
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:18,438
In this world, all those great people who
have been respected

146
00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:23,246
since centuries have been very, very
wise people –

147
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:27,979
not hot-tempered, not people who were
quarreling,

148
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:33,438
not people who were having lust as the aim
of their life.

149
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,112
Such people will be never remembered
by the progeny.

150
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:42,299
But that’s not so important, as you as
Sahaja yogis are very important.

151
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,958
You are here on this earth to emancipate
the whole of humanity.

152
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:55,772
So, what should be the aim of your life
is to go deep into your spirituality.

153
00:14:55,973 --> 00:15:00,993
This aim of getting into spirituality,
I think you all know, you see,

154
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:04,769
but you do not work out.

155
00:15:04,944 --> 00:15:10,009
I have told you last time that your
attention has to be inside,

156
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,809
not outside, and you should not react.

157
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:21,452
All these procedures help you to be wise,
to be sensible.

158
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:29,079
But the sensible person who is just sensible
as far as his own comforts are concerned,

159
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,034
money is concerned or his own health
is concerned –

160
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:41,282
everything encompassing him – is
not a wise person. He is not wise.

161
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:46,563
If you see a little child, who is properly
brought up of course,

162
00:15:46,764 --> 00:15:49,868
he will always bother about other people.

163
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:57,058
He’ll find out what others need, what are
– what can make them happy.

164
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:03,005
He’ll list all the simple methods, he will
try to please others,

165
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:08,619
but not to gain any favor or to show off
that he is very generous,

166
00:16:08,797 --> 00:16:15,681
but in the real sense of the word, that
gives him joy. That is the collectivity.

167
00:16:15,882 --> 00:16:19,337
Today I am going to tell you something more
about this collective nature

168
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:27,767
that comes to you through Shri Ganesha’s
efforts, or we can say His powers.

169
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:33,649
Somebody told Me that Einstein has already
made a story like that,

170
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:38,545
is a discovery that if you all become cool,

171
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:46,995
that is under the Shri Ganesha’s blessings,
then we all become one.

172
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:55,057
That’s his theory, but we also had
Phil Ward here who established

173
00:16:55,258 --> 00:16:59,352
that when you cool down the helium gas,

174
00:16:59,553 --> 00:17:07,764
all the molecules or you can call them
atoms,

175
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:11,785
they start moving in a collective way.

176
00:17:11,986 --> 00:17:15,741
Otherwise they are hitting each other,
they are beating each other

177
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:18,581
and they are running helter and skelter.

178
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:23,406
In the same way, when we have
Shri Ganesha’s blessings within us

179
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:26,612
in the real sense of the word,
with our wisdom,

180
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:34,374
then what happens, we become very much
evolved Sahaja yogis.

181
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:39,031
“Evolved Sahaja yogis” are, means they
have become one.

182
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:44,891
“One” means what? “One” means they all
live for each other,

183
00:17:45,092 --> 00:17:51,654
they enjoy each other, they see the comfort
of each other.

184
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:58,761
For example, the people who are very rich,
people who are very poor,

185
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:01,550
people who are sick, people who are
healthy,

186
00:18:01,751 --> 00:18:05,599
all of them combine together as one.

187
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:11,203
In Sanskrit it is called “ekakarita” –
they become one.

188
00:18:11,404 --> 00:18:16,694
And this oneness shows in your
celebrations, when you all come here

189
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,545
you try to help each other all the time,
I’ve seen –

190
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:22,610
nobody minds helping each other.

191
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:28,530
I have seen people enjoying each other.
They do not want to hurt anyone;

192
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:33,422
on the contrary, they want to be helpful
and sensible with each other.

193
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:41,629
Most of your leaders I have chosen who are
very wise, who avoid problems,

194
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:46,551
who do not get into panics, most of them,
I should say.

195
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:52,526
And when you see, even you people try
to destroy Sahaja Yoga,

196
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:55,240
they know you are doing it.

197
00:18:55,441 --> 00:19:00,906
So to find out this ekakarita, you have
to go deep down into yourself,

198
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:04,281
by which you will feel that you are
all one.

199
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:10,346
Whether you are here or you are in Japan
or in America, anywhere,

200
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:15,210
you all think the same way, you all help
the same cause,

201
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:18,835
and you try to be the same style.

202
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:24,178
I have seen people when they come
for the pujas, so many of them,

203
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:30,077
how they enjoy each other’s company,
how they try to help each other.

204
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:38,692
Somebody who is, say, in Russia or say,
in Bulgaria, anywhere,

205
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:45,794
he will write to Me about the problem
he has, something.

206
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:50,658
So somebody from America, without I tell
him, without I inform him,

207
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:55,621
without any information immediately writes
to Me, “Mother, such and such a person

208
00:19:55,822 --> 00:20:01,684
is there in Russia. Will You be able
to send that person to America?”.

209
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:07,399
Most of the time it happens like this.
But I don’t tell them.

210
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,512
I never ask them. Even if I ask, suddenly

211
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:17,906
there will be a response from so many
people, from so many countries,

212
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:22,976
“Mother, this is the problem? All right,
we’ll go and do it." For that I must say

213
00:20:23,177 --> 00:20:28,781
Austrians are very sensitive people
in this respect, in this ekakarita.

214
00:20:28,982 --> 00:20:33,614
They went all the way to Jerusalem,

215
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:39,874
you know, to help the people, to get
them realized.

216
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:45,023
I wanted to go to Jerusalem, but this
bombing business may not allow Me to go.

217
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:51,001
But the Jerusalem people, I found them,
found them to be much more collective,

218
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:56,350
because they came to Egypt.
I said, “Why have you come here?”

219
00:20:56,551 --> 00:21:02,055
“Make friends with the Muslims of Egypt."

220
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,161
Just imagine! I was surprised.
How could they come here?

221
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:11,130
“No, just to make friends. They are Muslims,
so we want to make friends with them.”

222
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,356
So making friendship without any ulterior
motive,

223
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:20,665
without any gain, is one of the signs
of your ekakarita.

224
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:24,122
Not only that you are satisfied with other
Sahaja yogis,

225
00:21:24,323 --> 00:21:30,680
but you want to bring other Sahaja yogis in.
So many have done that.

226
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:36,688
This is something so nourishing.

227
00:21:37,581 --> 00:21:43,514
Now, as you are been enlightened,

228
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:49,838
you get another person who is enlightened.
It’s very great joy-giving.

229
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:54,332
If you give realization to one person,
you feel very happy.

230
00:21:54,533 --> 00:22:00,338
I mean, so many write to Me, “Mother, now
we have got thirty persons, twenty persons”,

231
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:04,527
and they are very happy about it, that
we have got so many Sahaja yogis.

232
00:22:04,728 --> 00:22:09,734
But doing that, one should not develop
the ego – then again you go against Ganesha,

233
00:22:09,935 --> 00:22:13,870
because Christ, you know, He doesn’t
like it.

234
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:18,431
Egoistical people He doesn’t like, and
He is Shri Ganesh.

235
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:24,390
So He doesn’t like such people who
out of their ego want to create

236
00:22:24,591 --> 00:22:28,825
an organization of their own, and try
to dominate others.

237
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,538
This kind of people they don’t like.

238
00:22:32,745 --> 00:22:37,546
Both of them are the same, there is
complete ekakarita between them.

239
00:22:37,747 --> 00:22:42,966
In the same way we too develop that special
quality of ekakarita.

240
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:48,129
We forget about so-called religions that
we have. See now how they are fighting.

241
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,598
All the religions which are outside are
fighting among themselves.

242
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:56,008
They are dishonest, they are doing all kinds
of wrong things – you know it very well.

243
00:22:56,209 --> 00:23:01,412
Every day it’s in the newspaper that you
hear about what wrong they are doing.

244
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,546
They are little bit successful, but not
for a long time,

245
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:07,765
because they’ll be exposed. This is
the time of exposure,

246
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:15,276
that they will lose that great faith
on which they have been working out.

247
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:19,848
All these will have to just disappear,

248
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:25,097
these false ideas about superiority
of any religion.

249
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:28,563
How can a religion be superior to another
one,

250
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:34,105
which is created by the effort
of Shri Ganesha’s auspiciousness?

251
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:38,050
It’s not auspicious at all that you fight
another religion

252
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:46,742
or you fight another creed, or you say
that this is a lesser race,

253
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:52,742
or we are a higher race. All these false
ideas, they drop out.

254
00:23:52,943 --> 00:23:57,972
This doesn’t remain anymore, because all
these ideas have created problems.

255
00:23:58,173 --> 00:24:04,193
Say in America, they first hated the blacks,
so now the blacks are hating the whites.

256
00:24:04,394 --> 00:24:07,715
It’s a big turmoil going on, you see.

257
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:18,277
Then we have, also in India we had people
who were supposed to be untouchables.

258
00:24:18,478 --> 00:24:22,752
They were tortured, they were troubled,
and they did a lot of wrong things

259
00:24:22,953 --> 00:24:26,725
which they should have never done, which is
not written in the shastras.

260
00:24:26,926 --> 00:24:32,469
Because of that now they are acting against
the so-called “touchables”

261
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:39,369
and putting them right in their own places.
So this brings in conflict.

262
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,183
Shri Ganesha is the one, when He gives you
wisdom, you understand

263
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:46,881
that nobody is superior to another person.

264
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:53,929
You are all made by God, and is whatever is
made by God is auspicious and beautiful.

265
00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:00,126
Once you start understanding that,
this ekakarita spreads outside also.

266
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:08,149
It spreads to other people. It’s not just
because of a certain social understanding

267
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:14,328
and a social upliftment you try to be good
to others – no.

268
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:18,153
It is from inside; inside you do it.

269
00:25:18,354 --> 00:25:22,474
This ekakarita first must work
in the family. It’s very important.

270
00:25:22,675 --> 00:25:27,071
The family which is disturbed all the time
cannot create children

271
00:25:27,272 --> 00:25:31,365
who are in the state of ekakarita.

272
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:36,187
That’s why always tell them that don’t
fight.

273
00:25:36,388 --> 00:25:41,462
In the family they are fighting, they
cannot be Sahaja yogis.

274
00:25:41,663 --> 00:25:44,942
If there is such a fight it’s better
to get out of such a family.

275
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:48,509
So we have sanctioned also a divorce.

276
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:53,574
Any man who is flirting with other women
or doing wrong things,

277
00:25:53,775 --> 00:25:56,208
we have asked him to get out
of Sahaja Yoga.

278
00:25:56,409 --> 00:25:59,902
The reason is, one bad apple can spoil many
apples.

279
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:04,506
So such a man or such a woman should be
kept out of Sahaja Yoga completely,

280
00:26:04,707 --> 00:26:08,320
so that there is a better family
relationship,

281
00:26:08,521 --> 00:26:11,383
which is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

282
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:17,214
Your family relationships should be
absolutely perfect.

283
00:26:17,415 --> 00:26:22,232
But I can’t understand: you can’t enjoy
the company of your wife,

284
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:25,107
then what are you going to enjoy
in this world?

285
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:31,358
If you cannot enjoy the bliss of your family
life, you cannot enjoy anything else.

286
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:36,545
This very close relationship of husband
and wife is thrown apart

287
00:26:36,746 --> 00:26:39,453
because of Ganesha problem only.

288
00:26:39,654 --> 00:26:44,257
If the Ganesha was all right there would
have been a perfect union,

289
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:48,844
perfect understanding between husband
and wife. But that fails,

290
00:26:49,045 --> 00:26:54,868
that means there’s definitely something
wrong with the Shri Ganesha.

291
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:59,977
Try to correct your own Shri Ganesh
than to see to others.

292
00:27:00,178 --> 00:27:05,117
You have to meditate, and meditate
on Shri Ganesh,

293
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:08,529
you sit on the ground and meditate.

294
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:13,570
Now when we run away from the Mother Earth
and we don’t touch her,

295
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:19,217
we don’t respect her, in a way we don’t
respect Shri Ganesha.

296
00:27:19,418 --> 00:27:24,566
He was made out of Mother Earth,
and He controls the Mother Earth.

297
00:27:24,767 --> 00:27:33,369
He controls all the five elements. Not only
that, but He controls you.

298
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,914
I liked the film yesterday where they
showed a Ganesha walking about

299
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:42,410
with another person, who was telling,
“Don’t do this, and don’t do this.”

300
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:46,462
It’s a very, very beautiful film, because
it suggests

301
00:27:46,663 --> 00:27:50,307
that Ganesha is always there to tell you
not to do it.

302
00:27:50,508 --> 00:27:54,886
But if you do it then you develop all kinds
of horrible diseases,

303
00:27:55,087 --> 00:28:01,474
all kinds of horrible faces, all kinds
of family problems;

304
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:05,147
also you can develop national problems.

305
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:13,429
So this is so important to understand,
that such a feeling of,

306
00:28:14,223 --> 00:28:22,428
I should say, very inauspicious character
are to be avoided.

307
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:27,946
I can’t understand, how can people feel
so bad about small, small children,

308
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:30,988
some two-year-old child, some
five-year-old child?

309
00:28:31,189 --> 00:28:36,034
If you see a child, even a photograph
of a child, you feel like loving that,

310
00:28:36,235 --> 00:28:40,716
you feel like kissing that child.
If the children cannot be respected,

311
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:44,888
how can you understand the value
of Shri Ganesha?

312
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:49,430
See how sweet they are, how sweetly
they behave,

313
00:28:49,631 --> 00:28:55,779
and they are – they understand! They
understand you, they understand Me.

314
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,884
I know, even the small children, those who
are very small,

315
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:02,089
newly-born children understand Me.

316
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:08,685
So there’s innately within them is built in
a kind of a feeling

317
00:29:08,886 --> 00:29:12,697
of understanding the love.

318
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:18,046
To understand the love also is very
difficult for egoistical people,

319
00:29:18,231 --> 00:29:20,824
because they love themselves, they don’t
love anybody else.

320
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,964
Or if they love somebody it is out of lust,
maybe greed,

321
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:29,714
maybe some sort of a association.

322
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:33,102
But love for love’s sake is only possible

323
00:29:33,303 --> 00:29:39,869
if your Shri Ganesha is properly cleaned
out and kept there.

324
00:29:40,521 --> 00:29:47,815
We have come so far, and we have so many
Sahaja yogis all over the world.

325
00:29:48,016 --> 00:29:50,930
Of course, I have worked very hard,
I must say,

326
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:56,259
but you also have supported Me very much.
I am thankful to you.

327
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,409
It’s not possible in this Western world
specially, where there’s no consideration

328
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:08,322
of Ganesha’s Principle, that you people
should come out so well

329
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:13,949
and accept Sahaja Yoga as a life
for yourself.

330
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:21,891
In Sahaja Yog the most important thing is
to worship Shri Ganesha within you,

331
00:30:22,565 --> 00:30:27,267
and the quality of Shri Ganesha within you.
It’s very soothing,

332
00:30:27,468 --> 00:30:36,561
it’s very peace-giving, it’s very secure,
secure – security-creating power.

333
00:30:36,762 --> 00:30:41,540
If your Ganesha is all right nobody can
touch you,

334
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:47,543
nobody can destroy you, nobody can
upset you

335
00:30:47,744 --> 00:30:51,022
because He is the one who is the giver
of peace.

336
00:30:51,223 --> 00:30:55,868
The world peace is disturbed because
we have not worshipped Shri Ganesha.

337
00:30:56,069 --> 00:30:58,994
I’ve seen people in very big positions,

338
00:30:59,195 --> 00:31:04,239
in charge of military, in charge of that,
in charge – not in charge of themselves.

339
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,698
Their Ganesha is absolutely ruined and finished.

340
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,993
All such people are such leaders
of nations,

341
00:31:12,194 --> 00:31:16,115
and people try to follow them
in their own way.

342
00:31:16,316 --> 00:31:20,493
Though they may do something secretly,
doesn’t matter; people know about it.

343
00:31:20,694 --> 00:31:24,601
Because in auspiciousness if you are
losing,

344
00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:29,475
then the whole world comes to know,
somehow.

345
00:31:29,676 --> 00:31:34,155
It will all be exposed, because Satya Yuga
has come.

346
00:31:34,356 --> 00:31:40,046
In this new Yuga there’s light of the truth
within us,

347
00:31:40,247 --> 00:31:48,701
and this truth can expose all that is
nonsensical we have been doing.

348
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:56,586
Now truth is the quality of Shri Ganesh
Himself.

349
00:31:56,825 --> 00:32:02,140
He is the one who is giving us truth.

350
00:32:02,348 --> 00:32:08,153
In our brain it comes to us through
Jesus Christ.

351
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:16,442
Jesus Christ has worked so much, He’s done
so much;

352
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:22,147
but look at the condition of the people
who are supposed to be following Him,

353
00:32:22,993 --> 00:32:28,681
look at the way they are behaving. Let us
at least show that if you follow

354
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:35,195
Ganesha and Jesus Christ, you are
in the image of that personality

355
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:41,626
which is something so very spiritual.
Spiritual life is the giver of joy.

356
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:46,041
You cannot get joy out of anything else
but spirituality.

357
00:32:46,242 --> 00:32:49,263
You can get some satisfaction, you can get
some ego,

358
00:32:49,464 --> 00:32:53,624
you might feel that you are something
great, but the only way you can get

359
00:32:53,825 --> 00:33:02,058
the inner peace and joy is Shri Ganesha’s
manifestation in all the chakras.

360
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:08,238
He manifests in all the chakras which,
when you are

361
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:14,054
in a proper state on those chakras,
you get the joy,

362
00:33:14,255 --> 00:33:20,408
and that joy comes to you through
Shri Ganesh.

363
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:25,044
These days people are writing horrible
books, horrible things.

364
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:31,712
Also there are some who are trying to write
very sweet things

365
00:33:31,913 --> 00:33:36,278
about Shri Ganesha’s principle
of understanding,

366
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:40,789
principle of His auspiciousness.

367
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,653
Very sweetly I’ve seen some people have
written

368
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:49,242
some very, very sweet stories about Him.

369
00:33:49,443 --> 00:33:53,997
It’s not only the love stories –
up to a point, all right,

370
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,927
they created so many love stories,
love stories, love stories.

371
00:33:58,128 --> 00:34:01,319
Now something beyond that one has to know.

372
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,501
And beyond that is this Ganesha Principle,

373
00:34:06,702 --> 00:34:13,503
which is of complete peace, of complete
joy,

374
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:20,594
and of understanding of love, the value
of pure love;

375
00:34:20,795 --> 00:34:24,829
of giving, and also of taking it.

376
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:31,988
Anyone who gives you the pure love
should be understood in the right way.

377
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:37,890
I yesterday knew that Shri Ganesha has gone
off a little bit.

378
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:43,388
I don’t know why He was like that,
but one has to understand

379
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:46,949
that there must be some people within us
who do not follow

380
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:51,921
the Principle of Shri Ganesh, and that’s
why these troubles are there.

381
00:34:52,122 --> 00:34:57,160
So with sincere heart and a sincere mind

382
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:02,314
if you ask the blessings of Shri Ganesh,
He is always ready to give you.

383
00:35:02,515 --> 00:35:13,049
But if you don’t listen to Him and if you
destroy your chastity in any way,

384
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:19,855
He will punish you. He’ll not spare you,
He doesn’t have the idea of sparing.

385
00:35:20,056 --> 00:35:27,779
At the level of Christ only, He thought
of forgiving, of forgiving you.

386
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:34,155
But forgiving doesn’t mean that any, any
sin can be forgiven – no.

387
00:35:34,356 --> 00:35:37,822
It's like a kind of a controlling power.

388
00:35:38,023 --> 00:35:43,765
Christ has said that you’ll be forgiven,
but Shri Ganesha at a point,

389
00:35:43,966 --> 00:35:52,288
when He sees people are forgiving,
He tries to punish you.

390
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:56,929
That’s the limiting point where He thinks
it’s not proper

391
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:03,814
to forgive such and such person. So
for Christ, to forgive is all right,

392
00:36:04,544 --> 00:36:10,771
but for Ganesha, He has to expose
and punish the person.

393
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:16,434
So in a way you have to know that Christ is
very great,

394
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:20,830
because He gives us, He gives us
the forgiving power job,

395
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:28,888
and Shri Ganesha is very powerful because
He limits our forgiving power.

396
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:35,470
You may forgive anyone, you may say that,
“I would like to forgive,”

397
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:41,285
but we don’t know if Shri Ganesh will allow
to that extent.

398
00:36:41,486 --> 00:36:45,892
And Christ accepts that, because they are
the same,

399
00:36:46,093 --> 00:36:48,619
they are like the two sides of one coin.

400
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:55,040
So we cannot depend too much

401
00:36:55,241 --> 00:37:01,494
on the forgiveness power of Christ, because
there is Ganesha always sitting there

402
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:08,858
and He has in His hand, you have seen,
a very powerful weapon.

403
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:15,147
He is the one who is just peace, who is
coolness,

404
00:37:15,348 --> 00:37:18,572
who gives you coolness after realization.

405
00:37:18,754 --> 00:37:23,119
You get the cool breeze because
of Shri Ganesh,

406
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:31,057
because it is Brahmachaitanya, no doubt,
but the one who emits it is Shri Ganesha.

407
00:37:31,258 --> 00:37:38,142
He cools you down. He brings you down
to a very cool, satisfied,

408
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:43,943
and a person with complete calmness.

409
00:37:44,144 --> 00:37:46,931
With that calmness you become all one.

410
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:51,043
This ekakarita is established, oneness is
established.

411
00:37:51,244 --> 00:38:01,757
Whatever country you may be believing in,
whatever country you may be proud of,

412
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:06,913
you will see the bad things in that country
and you will try to improve that.

413
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:09,439
You will not be identified with the bad.

414
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,969
This is the greatest thing of the Satya
Yuga, that it exposes,

415
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:18,797
and you do not support something
that is wrong,

416
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:25,449
which is being done as a aggression
– you don’t accept.

417
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:30,972
And once you don’t accept that, then
you start becoming one with the people

418
00:38:31,173 --> 00:38:35,712
who are one with you. And they all
believe in the same thing,

419
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:40,916
their ideas are the same, their thinking
is the same, their joy is the same,

420
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:43,709
and they enjoy each other very much.

421
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:50,801
They become one, and this oneness has to be
established fully in Sahaja Yoga.

422
00:38:51,354 --> 00:38:54,529
Some people who are only interested
in making money,

423
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:59,308
who are interested in getting a good crowd
or some sort of a thing

424
00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:05,681
of a very low level, cannot; those who are
in Sahaja Yoga to find

425
00:39:05,882 --> 00:39:10,813
wives for themselves or husbands for
themselves, aren’t going to.

426
00:39:11,014 --> 00:39:14,413
This spirituality grows with humility.

427
00:39:14,614 --> 00:39:21,675
And the humility of Ganesha is told by
His venture once, when His Mother asked Him

428
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:27,959
that, “The one who will go round the Earth
three times, I’ll give Him a present."

429
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:36,649
So Ganesha thought, “Who is greater
than My Mother? Not this Earth."

430
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:40,061
He had a small little rat on which He used
to travel.

431
00:39:40,262 --> 00:39:46,486
This shows that He was so humble: on a rat
He could travel, no pressure on the rat.

432
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:55,658
And while His brother Kartikeya had
a peacock which could fly,

433
00:39:55,843 --> 00:40:01,981
so He knew He cannot go round the world
and win over His brother.

434
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:07,604
So He just went round His Mother three
times, and He got the present.

435
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:14,022
This shows one thing, that speed is not
the way of success.

436
00:40:14,223 --> 00:40:17,292
You have to slow down your speed.

437
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:21,827
Apart from that, you have to understand
what is the most important thing,

438
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:27,172
as He understood the most important
thing is

439
00:40:29,172 --> 00:40:32,181
to love your Mother, to respect
your Mother,

440
00:40:32,382 --> 00:40:40,274
and know that She is the highest, She is
the greatest.

441
00:40:40,475 --> 00:40:47,099
And that is how He has been expressed
within ourselves.

442
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,019
Once that happens, your spirituality grows.

443
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:58,341
I hope you will work it out this way now,
Shri Ganesha, and start an ekakarita.

444
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:01,705
I don’t like people writing letters against
their leaders,

445
00:41:01,906 --> 00:41:06,992
against this man, against that man.
That’s not good. There’s no need.

446
00:41:07,193 --> 00:41:16,037
If you just can be forgiving, and keeping
one with each other.

447
00:41:16,238 --> 00:41:21,633
Try to get more people, and more people.
You cannot separate anyone

448
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:25,750
as saying that they are condemned,
they are no good. Try to get them.

449
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:30,660
With your forgiveness, with your sense
of chastity, things will improve.

450
00:41:30,861 --> 00:41:33,953
So this exclusiveness also should be
given up,

451
00:41:34,154 --> 00:41:38,629
which perhaps comes from a kind of a sense
of insecurity, I think.

452
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,737
It is Shri Ganesha! If they are wrong type
of people, He drives them out.

453
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:46,729
So don’t get frightened of them, and don’t
get upset with them.

454
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:55,261
Try to be one, one, and try to be more
attracting people to yourself,

455
00:41:55,462 --> 00:42:00,825
keeping them to you, trying to manage them
and look after them.

456
00:42:01,026 --> 00:42:06,408
I hope you will all meditate now after this
to develop your Ganesha qualities,

457
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:13,981
and develop that power of chastity,
and also of peace and security.

458
00:42:14,182 --> 00:42:16,246
May God bless you.
