1
00:00:00,969 --> 00:00:06,389
Joining me right now is Shri Mataji and She is known throughout the world as a saint.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:12,300
And that's the first time that I have been able to meet a saint. And you're also a faith healer or psychic healer,

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,509
I guess some people call you.

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:19,559
But when asked in a recent interview as to whether or not you were a saint or considered yourself to be a saint,

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,560
you had a very unusual answer. Are you?

6
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,549
Actually, you cannot certify yourself isn't it as anything?

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,450
The quality of a saint is that he can make other saints. If he can make, others,

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,570
saints, then he's a saint. Otherwise, it's just self-certification.

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,860
Can you make other people saints?

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,660
I think so, yes.

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,680
How would you define a centre? What would another person become that would make him a saint?

12
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,239
The person who becomes a saint

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,260
develops a new awareness as a result of a

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,200
living process of evolution

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,440
that he becomes the Spirit as described by Christ

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,880
that: "You are to be born again". And in that, the awareness becomes its actualization.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,940
It's not just mental projection, but actualization,

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,740
that you become a person

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,500
who is Collectively conscious.

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,120
You mentioned Christ and yet you are from an Eastern country being from India.

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,900
Do you believe in Jesus Christ

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,660
Of course, of course he plays a very big role in your evolution.

23
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,340
He is the gate as said.

24
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,280
So then by your definition a saint could be a person who might be a born-again Christian

25
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,820
who might have taken the collective consciousness of Jesus into their lives?

26
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,800
You see, those who accept him mentally are not born again.

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,680
Thought, it is a happening that has to take place.

28
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,680
Baptism is a happening and that happening takes place when there's a vital force

29
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,200
within our sacrum bone which rises.

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,680
You can actually feel the rising of that force it comes up onto the fontanel bone area -we'll be baptized-

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,100
and you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

32
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,220
Yes, they say that there's a cool breeze

33
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,160
Breeze of the Holy Ghost

34
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,660
That people feel.

35
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,160
Yes

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,560
And another interviews that I, that I read about you said that the interviewer who interviewed you,

37
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,480
that you put your hand above  the interviewer

38
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:11,980
Yeah.

39
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,800
And he was able to also feel the cool breeze

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,820
Yes, yes. And also from the

41
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,200
Can you give me the cool breeze? I've been waiting all my life for that.

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,220
Yes, I think you pass

43
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,840
Yes, right?

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,620
You were little upset in the beginning when I ,

45
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,860
I was upset this morning.

46
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,640
And i's alright

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,360
Yes.

48
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,700
I think but now you have cool down, and it will work out in no time.

49
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,920
So will I, will I get the cool breeze,

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,420
Of course.

51
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,240
Or do you have to touch me?

52
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,920
No, no, no, no. It might help, talking to me you might get it, but actually you feel it on your fingertips.

53
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,140
As Muhammad Sahib has said that: "At the time of Resurection your hands will speak."

54
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,860
And for the first time you feel that All-pervading subtle power,

55
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,180
that you become something more than what you are.

56
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,820
That's the saint.

57
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,240
You have healed many people how many would you estimate they've healed in your lifetime?

58
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,820
I don't know how many, I've never kept count out.

59
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,820
Hundreds?

60
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,940
Yes, at least

61
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,540
At least at least hundreds

62
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,380
Yes, at least hundreds.

63
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:09,960
But, actually the people who become Saints can also. So if you see Sahaja Yoga, it can be in thousands.

64
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,860
Because so many people who became prophets, they have done it.

65
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,980
They are also healing other people.

66
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,020
Yes they are also. They are healing much more than myself nowadays.

67
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,280
What type of diseases or things have you been able to heal?

68
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:26,380
Most of the incurable diseases get healed, but it's not a faith healing, in the sense you don't have to have faith,

69
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,540
or you don't have to believe into any thigns. There's not blindness about it. There's no blindness.

70
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:40,020
Actually, it's a happening, as I told you, like a sprouting of the seed. As a seed sprouts, in the same way, your awakening takes place.

71
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,000
And by that you get your parasympathetic nervous system nourished.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a question of nourishment.

73
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,300
Nourishment, that's how it works out.

74
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,360
You have made a lot of statements about Orthodox religion specifically, Catholicism and Protestantism.

75
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,580
Every "ism".

76
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,080
What do you feel about them? What sorts you about that honorship to them?

77
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,240
All religions, you see, are nothing but philosophies. They are just philosophies.

78
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,480
They are words, words and words.

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,480
As Christ Himself - now, let's see he said that:

80
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,440
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

81
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,560
Can you find any Christian without  adulterous eyes, it's rather difficult.

82
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,180
Hum, hum.

83
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,860
Why? Why is it when he said so, why is it we cannot have those innocent eyes?

84
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:25,060
We should have! The reason is what he said that : "He is to be born again within you."

85
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,040
And there's, there's a specific place where Christ is awakened when this force rises.

86
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:39,360
And here, one of the articles I read said that you felt that some of the Orthodox religions were based on ignorance and extremism. So it sounded to me-

87
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,520
Fanatacism.

88
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,800
that you were being negative about them.

89
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,580
No not very negative

90
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,680
I should say, as a mother, that they're mislaid, they are mislead people.

91
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,180
Mislead

92
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,360
Mislead.

93
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:57,860
You see they just started thinking that by reading something or by praying it will work out. You have to be connected first with God

94
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,080
So how do you get connected?

95
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,520
Connected? God has placed everything within you. Everything is within you and it's only the person who is a saint can do it.

96
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,260
It's like the Mother Earth: what you do is to put the seed in her and it sprouts it by itself. It's your own.

97
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,160
Hum, hum.

98
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,500
So it's spontaneous, it's living.

99
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,340
There is an article from a London newspaper that mentioned that a young boy 17 years old had been very badly injured

100
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,660
almost to the point of being mangled on a motorcycle

101
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,570
And he was- let's say- two miles away from where you were. And yet he claims that he saw you come to him

102
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:37,740
He thought that you were really there, apparently it was a vision, that you placed your hands on various parts of his body and he was healed.

103
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,640
 

104
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,980
.....The accident saw you there, but yet you were there. How?

105
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,880
It's true, it works out.

106
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,360
How can you explain that?

107
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,260
You see, we must know that in the realm of God all your telecommunication television, is so efficient,

108
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,460
it works, you see,

109
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,060
 

110
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,180
Just like I'm sitting here, but I'm there and I'm everywhere as then you can see it.

111
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,620
In the same way in his "television" they have arrangements like that and you can work it out. It's simple.

112
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,060
One other thing you said is that you are able to cure AIDS. How?

113
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:16,040
Yes, it could be cured because it's a -what I have seen through this Collective Consciousness,

114
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,040
that AIDS is caused by the combination of three subtle centres within us.

115
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,200
And if these three centers can be nourished, it can be cured.

116
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,960
I - I think one fellow got cured in London.

117
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,080
But you also said in another interview something to the effect that if you,

118
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,040
if everyone became Collectively conscious

119
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,160
or at one with you or as sane as you want to put it,

120
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:42,040
that there would be no more homosexuality. So are you saying then that homosexuality is a negative thing?

121
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,200
No, it is unnatural.

122
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,080
Unnatural?

123
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,480
It is not natural. The thing is when they get homosexual, it is because of the forced conditions.

124
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,620
For example, say,  you see, if they see the women are too dominating,

125
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,480
it's difficult to carry on with them,

126
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,140
they are not any more women, there are more men, you see, so

127
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,080
they prefer men who are womanish sort of thing, it's a mixture. The society is quite mixed up.

128
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,040
Or also can be possible sometimes a man can be possessed by a woman

129
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,060
and she might - he might behave like that. It's a complicated personality.

130
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,940
Jerry Falwell was on her show last week I believe a week before,

131
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:25,060
he said that the natural state that would cure a lot of things is monogamy: one man for one woman. Do you agree?

132
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,700
Of course I mean, that's natural to be like that! No problems.

133
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,840
He said that our society, society  has become too promiscuous and that's why that we have all these new diseases.

134
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,500
Yes. You see the thing is, we are on an ego oriented society

135
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,740
and where we think: "What's wrong?" But we don't see the whole we just see part of it, you see.

136
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:50,420
And ego can never lead us to right things. Our Self is the one that gives us all the security,

137
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,100
all the wisdom, all the guidance. And then we just become monogamous automatically.

138
00:07:54,100 --> 00:08:00,080
I don't have to tell. Most people who became prophets, as I said, got cured they became monogamous.

139
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,800
They were, some of them were homosexuals they became normal people they got married.

140
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:10,080
Okay. We are out of time. I'd love to chat with you more some of your ideas are very, very fascinating.

141
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,800
For those of you that would like to go and intend a free lecture,

142
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,500
I don't know if we can call  "lecture", but experience with Shri Mataji,

143
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,520
there are three meetings that shall be available  to- you'll be able to see her here in Los Angeles.

144
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,960
First this Saturday at the First Methodist Church on Franklin Avenue right here in Hollywood.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,480
And also then again on Monday and on Tuesday, and that's at 7 o'clock so this Saturday first United Methodist Church of Hollywood.

146
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,780
Thank you very much.

147
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,240
Thank you.

148
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,300
Thank you, okay.
