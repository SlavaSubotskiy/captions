Give it to this gentleman to put his feet.

Yes, Y: India. SM, Which part? Y: Delhi. SM , Which part? Delhi.

181
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,520
So where did you pick them up all of these people

182
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,320
SM, In Delhi? Y: in this country. SM, Here in England?

183
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,520
They are now all of shifted to America.

00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,080
Better now.

185
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,880
Better now, are you feeling any cool breeze?

186
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,080
Great! Keep it up.

187
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,400
What about this gentleman. Got Agnya little.

188
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,920
Now what you can do is to take that thing out.

189
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,640
through it away somebody carefully.

190
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,400
and bring for him also, take out your socks.

191
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,120
So lets work it out individually.

192
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,760
Yes, they are good, both of them.

193
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,720
He is all right, this, better.

194
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,200
You have some camphor with you.

195
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,200
Camphor do you have in the Ashram.

196
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,800
Camphor little bit mix with oil.

197
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,520
Yes, May be, but camphor with oil we need.

198
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,520
Better.

199
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,640
You are actually Baptizing yourself.

200
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,080
Because you are your own guru, you don't need guru at all.

201
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,280
There is no need to have a guru.

202
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,560
Only thing you have to become the spirit,

203
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,800
Once you becomes the spirit, you are the guru.

204
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,480
You got the absolute, why should you have the guru?

205
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,480
All right, better now. Y: hot.  SM, Hot, left side.

206
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,000
Y: More, more is there on left side.

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,360
You put your right hand like this, like this ya.

208
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
It's ventilating you see.

209
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,960
What about him, let him also put his right hand like this.

210
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,520
Now who else is the new person here

211
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,120

He's from New York.Y: Australia.

213
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:48,120
Australia! Hum! It's a nice country, lets see now.

214
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,880
where has he been?

215
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,880
All various things.

216
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,520
No one.

217
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,360
But you have read books, something.

218
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,320
And spiritualists  ESPs.

00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,800
Parapsychology?

220
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,680
Anything like that, parapsychology, psychology also.

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,640
Yogi: years ago, ten years ago. SM, Which where did you go.

00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,960

No no, what was the thing you read? Just we want to know that.

227
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,080
It will be better, it will help us.

228
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,920
If you can remember something.

229
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,720

00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,560
Y: Carnesis Mother. who is that one.

00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,760
Moving objects.

With your mic.

233
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,480
Give him a bandhan.

234
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,840
There is liver, his left side very caught up.

235
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,480
Did you do Siddha course and all that?

236
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,480
Siddha course and all that you did.

237
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,200
Y:(...) You did? From where?

238
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,080

239
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,800
Yogi: No in england.

240
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:35,920
In England, where?

241
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,240
In London, in ..... Where? Y: London.

242
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,440
Y: I did it in London and also did ...

243
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,240
What?

244
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,640
The name of the company in L....

245
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,400
SM: Poor thing. Y:(...)

246
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,200
We have a deputy director, Who, What is that?

247
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,480
What is he talking about?

248
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,240
Aah..Y:(...) SM: Poor thing.

249
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,520
They have really.

250
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,680
Y: The flying technique ....

251
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,880
I have done the flying but could never fly.

252
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,600
He was in charge of that , this one is sitting here.

253
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,680
He was in charge in Scott land.

254
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,480
No its wrong,It's nonsense, It's not true.

255
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,560
Y: I comes true, how did I swollen myself.

256
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,440
They were doing practicing of same techniques

257
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,480
which I was but I didn't fly but they did.

258
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,040
So they were just jumping like you can jump on a horse.

259
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,280
I saw them going up.

260
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,120
No. Can not.Y: (...)

261
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,320
It's only mesmerism.

262
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,080
With that one can see anything, one feel like, but I

263
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,200
Y: (...)

264
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,360
They were not going up, you see what happens that

265
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,440
They have foreman all that , they were made to jump and jump jump

266
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,600
So you develop a kind of a ...

267
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,080
They they were sitting, they couldn't jump.

268
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,040
See the gentleman who was doing this, teaching this is here.

269
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,880
Flying technique, and he end up with

270
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,280
nothing but epilepsy

271
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,960
We have to recognise him

272
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,120
He was deputy director of the technique.

273
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,640
And it was all falls.

274
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,840
Y: But I don't see it.

275
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,920
You see what happens that they are spirits.

276
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,120
and they just give you a sought of a jump.

277
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,680
That's all, we have people they came for My program

278
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,400
and suddenly they started jumping.Now I said,This is too much.

279
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,440
Because you see everybody started running up.

280
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,440
from that mad crowd.

281
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,600
We had a Ashram.

282
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,200
There they came just screaming you see, even looking at Me

283
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,920
They would just jump from here to there.

284
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,160
And screaming and shouting, you see there are people,

285
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,120
nearby said, we can't have this Ashram

286
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,680
Some sought of a black magic is going on.

287
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,920
They brought such a bad name poor.

288
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,240
See My point.

289
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,960
Is not jumping, it's just a spirit that

290
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
throws you off for while, that's not jumping.

291
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,640
That's what, what you call.

292
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,240
Beg a pardon, You this approve this.

293
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,520
Now you just tell Me, you are a reasonable man

294
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,240
How can I approve of such a non sense as that.

295
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,480
We are going to become birds now or something high.

296
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,400
Do you understand?

297
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,800
Not only disapprove but condemn it.

298
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,320
Horrible thing they have done, money making proposition.

299
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,960
And be fool.Y: Money making.SM: and be fooling, both thing.

300
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,760
How much money this man has made, do you know?

301
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,160
You are too simple and naive to understand

302
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,960
And the treachery.... of these people.

303
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,640
It's all money making.

304
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,880
Simple as that and be fooled.

305
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,360
Don't get upset but it is.

306
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,640
Absolutely that.

307
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,280
You reach no where, it's all telling lies.

308
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
One after another,

309
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,560
The director, who was here, now he has gone to Africa,

310
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,760
he told Me, not this, this is deputy director.

311
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,960
The director was another fellow.

312
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,560
And his wife is here out, so she has come?

313
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,400
Linda. she isn't come today, all right.

314
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,080
You should meet them and they will tell you all the stories,

315
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,080
what there, they have been there, they are in charge

316
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,760
I mean, He was the one, who was running the academy.

317
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,760
His wife and he use to tell people

318
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,000
that I walk through the walls

319
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,480
I said, "But why did you say such a thing?

320
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,280
Also that technique suitable for bare player.

321
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,840
But that technique doesn't work out, it's falls hood.

322
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,480
What I am trying to tell you,

323
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,240
I said, "Why did you tell them lies?They were asked to tell.

324
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,400
They said, "Unless and until you tell the people,

325
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,040
The people are not going to believe you and this won't run.

326
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,560
Big money was involves of this man.

327
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,720
So he started telling lies and he confessed it.

328
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,680
Absolutely

329
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,680
Y: Who is the in charge now? SM: is now Peter Peers.

330
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,640
And his wife is still there in England.

331
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,360
I thing, she will come some, you will meet her some time.

332
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,640
All right, So you meet them and they will tell you all the,

333
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,920
They will tell you all the tricks, what they were trying to do.

334
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,840
These are all the tricks.

335
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,200
Now you want the real or not.

336
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,840
Or some tricks like that.

337
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,120
Y: What are the is like here before hearing what they did.

338
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,400
The way they charged money and all and

339
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,040
they deny to people who do enough for,

340
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,960
You see, that is one of the thing one should think.

341
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,360
always that you can't play for God.

342
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,040
If it is your ascent in spirituality

343
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,680
It is a natural thing spontaneous.

344
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,480
It's within you, and you can't pay for God.

345
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,800
But you see, People and human being can't understand God.

346
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,080
It's beyond them to see this point

347
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,120
because they have seen Churches taking money,

348
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,680
temples taking money, everybody taking money,

349
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,680
When they think these are another type, you see

350
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,120
But if you have to have an alternative for that

351
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,120
that should be at least

352
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,240
Free for you, it should be free for everyone.

353
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,960
That's not the only point,

354
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,960
it's much worse then that you will know that.

355
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,760
On top of your head,

356
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,080
just to, no no, on top of your head, all right

357
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,320
tap it on. on top of your head.

358
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,560
Just on your Sahasrara, Yes yes, just in front.

359
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,240
It seems to be cool.

360
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,120
And look at your own condition

361
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,280
You see the, you should see the people, how they have become.

362
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,200
Just put it on his head, little bit,

363
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,920
little bit with your own hand.

364
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,680
Will be better

365
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,680
Just or let him do himself.

366
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,800
Little bit,

367
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,960
already he has got cold, or let him drink that water.

368
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,320
Water would be better, he is all void caught up,

369
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,960
his left side caught up, he is very very left sided

370
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,160
It's going to take time to get all right,

371
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,200
All right, if you want you can drink it.

372
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,320
Now it's better, better?

373
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,960
Burning is there but the rest is all right.

374
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,560
They take advantage

375
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,280
For icing now you just mix it up in there, little bit in that oil.

376
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,040
Y: (...) SM: that is, all that,

377
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,720
..with your finger.

378
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,960
Y: (...)

379
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,960
They don't dissolve and it should become powder.

380
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,880
They are becoming. Y: Yes.

381
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,840
Yes, better now, how is he, Is he better now?

382
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,960
Just very very hot in the left.

383
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,160
Poor thing. Walter, where has he been?

384
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,920
He has been to everywhere.

385
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,320
No wonder.

386
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,640
Is he all right tor he has some problem.

387
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,160
Natural .....super natural

388
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,400
Super natural and ES ESP astrology.

389
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,040
I mean whats the use of super natural

390
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,680
that we can't even keep good health, minimum.

391
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,560
You see we should ask ourselves a question.

392
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,720
At least our health should be all right, it's all right now.

393
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,480
It's better, keep him his eyes open.

394
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,160
You see getting vibrations on top of his head.

395
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,040
We can move right to the left.

396
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,320
He is all right. Are you all right now?

397
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,760
Are you feeling cool breeze in the hand or not?

398
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,880
Now keep it up, you are all right. Give him a bandhan.

399
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,960
So twenty one years of this so what is your age now.

400
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,160
Yes, Secret

401
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,560
My age has a secret.

402
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,760
Secret? For What?

403
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,720
I don't wa..a

404
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,760
I have ... to keep my age secret.

405
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,800
All right.Y:(...)

406
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,440
No it's all right, whatever you say.

407
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,480
Because that's why I was thinking you were worried about time, why?

408
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,280
I found that to play this (mahari)

409
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,000
she's program takes  an awful lot of time

410
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,760
But no one has gained anything.

411
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,480
Y:, I beg a pardon. SM, But nobody has gained anything.

412
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,080
Y: (...)

413
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,720
That's how they propagate.

414
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,520
They have a very good propaganda.

415
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,280
But they are caught up some times.

416
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,000
One day they were saying that

417
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,360
they tried to take the X-ray of  people

418
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,800
of the brain and they found

419
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,640
there are theta rays coming out of it.

420
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,800
So one of the Doctor who was there

421
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,040
was a Sahaja Yogi, he caught up and he said,

422
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,120
Theta rays only shows that the person is epileptic.

423
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,760
and they did not know, where to look?

424
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,760
Really what they gave you epilepsy.

425
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,440
That's the only thing, you end up with epilepsy.

426
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,240
That's the end of TM.

427
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,720
It's good, I must say but he is a great seeker.

428
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,360
All right, now put your hand, now one thing is

429
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,240
that TM people ask too many questions and they take time.

430
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,160
So just don't ask any question.

431
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,240
First your realization, all right.

432
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,320
Put some TM with him, thatâ€™s better.

433
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,080
Will you look after him? All right, come along.

434
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,720
you come this side, he will look after you, the deputy director.

435
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,680
How is now? Ya, just come here.

436
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,800
It's better that you you you stay with him.

437
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,160
I mean you understand him,

438
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,360
he will tell you better, he knows all things,

439
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,920
he has gone through. Can you ask?

440
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,240
All right, now what you do is ask

441
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,120
this gentleman and that gentleman to put it here into, on this.

442
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,280
into Yes, they have got all.

443
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,520
Y: (...) SM:, on to.

444
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,880
This spot, You can use this and put it here, just put it here.

445
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,440
Not with your finger, Vishuddhi finger, Yes.

446
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,120
Just there, May be it might  have.

447
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,320
Let's see, left Agnya.

448
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,600
Now take a candle for him.

449
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,840
You can take him that side and work it out.You see better.

450
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,440
Can you come this side a little bit please?

451
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,080
Can you get up and sit on this side?

452
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,520
If he could  move a little bit this side then?

453
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,400
He can work out on both of them.

454
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,800
Now , are you better now?

455
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,840
You are better now,You are feeling the cool breeze. Not yet.

456
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,160
It's had the void, still.

457
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,640
you say the mantras of the void and he will be all right. sit down.

458
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,880
I  think yes most of them wanted, little bit.

459
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,600
You see in Sahaja Yoga you are not given any mantra or anything.

460
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,480
There is no, nothing like giving you into a big course.

461
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,120
Like teaching you one after another any mantra or anything.

462
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,840
It's not like this.

463
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,400
What you have to know, where the Kundalini is, how it is moving?

464
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,160
Where it is ? What is the Chakra catching?

465
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,080
and what is the mantra for that?

466
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,520
It doesnâ€™t take anything, hardly takes about a week.

467
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,560
For you to understand the whole thing.

468
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,240
But gradually as you start moving it, you become proficient.

469
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,120
Then you can know, how to do it for yourself and for others.

470
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,960
There is not much of a thing like a child,

471
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,120
When he comes up a little age,

472
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,480
It starts picking up language.

473
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,920
Because he has built in capacity,

474
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,800
to create sound.

475
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,080
And he does it, in the same way,

476
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,440
Once you get it,

477
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,120
when you get the cool breeze in your hand,

478
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,960
you learn it by using it.

479
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,200
You understand it, your self.

480
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,000
You become yourself quite proficient

481
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,360
And you will be amazed, how fast you learn this.

482
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,440
You don't have to learn it just like a

483
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,840
Science book or anything.

484
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,320
Just start learning with

485
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,840
This is the Chakra, it is catching, because now,

486
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,880
for example this Chakra is catching.

487
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,040
Right side, Now there is a mantra for this is of Shri Krishna.

488
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,720
Say this Chakra is catching,

489
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,360
Here, then this the Mantra for Jesses Christ.

490
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,160
Like that you must know,

491
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,840
the Mantra's and the Chakras.

492
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,400
But the Chakras you just know

493
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,920
as a absolutely a knowledge.

494
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,840
Which is built in your nerves.

495
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,560
Just feel it,

496
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,360
This is, now this gentleman is saying it's hot here.

497
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,880
All right, what is that, hot here means what?

498
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,280
That the Sahasrara, at the left side.

499
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,440
First it was the Sahasrara on the right.

500
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,360
Now on the left side,

501
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,920
So that means, there is a Mantra for that,

502
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,400
and that one must be used.

503
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,360
If you use that this will be cleared.

504
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,720
All right, that is how you have to know.

505
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,120
And that's why I said,

506
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,200
it takes time for people, sometimes.

507
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,880
They establish because first you have to know it

508
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,080
and then use it.

509
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,880
Come along, are you come for the first time?

510
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,920
All right, come along, come along this side.

511
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,120
So it is not a difficult thing.

512
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,920
It is not at all a difficult thing to learn it.

513
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,280
It's very easy, you can pick it up in no time.

514
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,080
As soon as you start using your hands on other people.

515
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,000
Please be seated.

516
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,880
Just see them some people come along.

517
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,200
Now these people say,

518
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,040
Who are the latest who have come to Sahaja Yoga.

519
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,560
Let's say, the latest one.

520
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,120
Say those who have come about a month back.

521
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,520
Se he came back, she came back only one month.

522
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,600
And, Y: This is the Sahasrara ...

523
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,640
Monday. all right, he's got, but you see.

524
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,840
Have you been giving vibrations now?

525
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,760
In one month, it starts, so you can imagine.

526
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,040
And you know about the Chakras now.

527
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,560
About the Mantras.

528
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,440
Yes, see that's,  it's very simple.

529
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,400
If you pay attention to it, you can do it much faster.

530
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,560
There are many people who are here.

531
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,280
With in a month one, one's style.

532
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,160
They picked up so many things,

533
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,000
many, within one month's time.

534
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,320
It's all right, because you becomes the knowledge.

535
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,640
You start feeling it one your fingers.

536
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:50,960
Unless you know, this is the Chakra,

537
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,960
If this finger is, say burning,

538
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,960
that means your left heart is catching.

539
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,880
If your left heart is catching

540
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,640
then you know then you know, because it's burning.

541
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,160
There is nothing to go to the books or anything.

542
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,120
anything to find out, the burning is there.

543
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,560
Isn't it, that is the left heart is catching.

544
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,600
Now only you have to know,

545
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,240
While, when Left heart is catching,

546
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,240
the decoding only, what does that mean?

547
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,840
Your hands will speak, Christ has said. All right.

548
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,960
They will speak, I am just decoding.

549
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,160
Now you see for yourself, if it is true or not.

550
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,800
What does that mean?

551
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,240
Left heart means, there is a problem on the heart.

552
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,960
May be the person is over hard working.

553
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,800
He has forgotten about the spirit.

554
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,720
The Mantra is, you have to say I am the spirit.

555
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,280
It's so simple.

556
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,840
Because you have forgotten about your spirit.

557
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,560
You are on the right side,

558
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,360
in the sense you are more extro..

559
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,880
You are an extrovert.

560
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,560
And more attention is outside.

561
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,440
Not towards is your spirit, left heart is catching.

562
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,480
You start understanding Sahaja Yoga so well.

563
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,720
When your vibrations are sturdy.

564
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,240
Now this finger this is catching.

565
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,280
Now this is catching means

566
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,000
The person has been to somebody

567
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,520
Who is an unauthorized in Spiritual life.

568
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,960
Any thing say, ESP

569
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,280
you call it EST, then you have got

570
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,000
but parapsychology, even psychology.

571
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,000
Then you have other thing like all these guru.

572
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,760
Fall gurus, then can say this aura business.

573
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,680
What else is there, just now he was telling.

574
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,320
Super natural and

575
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,480
under natural and

576
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,160
all these things, you know.

577
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,720
all alternative we can think of.

578
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,360
Anything, you can think of all these things.

579
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,240
And the books and the Lama and the Dhama' and everything.

580
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,160
Even people who go, a sought of

581
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,280
adhere to Church too much.

582
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,480
or adhere to Catholicism.

583
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,240
Because they are not connected with God

584
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,680
and they are unauthorized.

585
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,960
But if you have been to real guru,

586
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,600
then immediately I will know.

587
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,920
You won't have this problem and ascent will be fast.

588
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:01,920
If you have been to real guru.

589
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,640
But how many are real these days.

590
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,080
In the market only those who are marketing guard there as it is.

591
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,800
In the market only the buyers and the shop keepers.

592
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,920
It's a market place now.

593
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,680
So the real guru's are not to be seen.

594
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,760
There are of course I know, there are many real gurus also.

595
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,560
But where ever they are

596
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,840
They are not in the market, I am the only person fighting them,

597
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,520
And tell them off, you see,

598
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,600
None of them are willing to come down or to conceive to anything

599
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,560
they are saying these human beings are hopeless.

600
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,800
They say twelve year you work Mother then we come down.

601
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,760
They want Me alone to fight the thing.

602
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,480
Poor thing, doesn't matter, so now,

603
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,360
It's a market place, there are buyer.

604
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,280
There simple naive customers.

605
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,600
They just put such absurd things like

606
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,360
somebody says alright, I want to sell

607
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,960
a big palace with this and that

608
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,120
and all that. Only you have to deposit two thousand pounds.

609
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,720
All right, people will be quite willing,

610
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,680
Oh what a bargain? That's big, two thousand

611
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,960
And the palace may belong to the Queen.

612
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,400
If you go there and ask them, Which palace.

613
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,720
Palace wants to say that this is the palace,

614
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,920
and that belongs to the Queen.

615
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,280
This is unauthorized.

616
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,440
Unauthorized people

617
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,560
Who have nothing to do with God.

618
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,960
Who claim that they have something to do with.

619
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,800
With God is falls.

620
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,320
And that's why they catch on this finger.

621
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,400
And what do they do, they use all these techniques.

622
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,040
This techniques are called in Sanskrit language as Avidya.

623
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,480
Avidya means, non knowledge.

624
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,600
You can say that is not knowledge.

625
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,360
something anti knowledge, anti God.

626
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,760
This is anti God, so for that,

627
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,800
the mantra is Shuddha Vidya,

628
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,240
means the pure technique

629
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,120
is the Mantra. Pure technique is the  Mantra. Pure!

630
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,360
means, the one that comes from the spirit.

631
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,520
Now, what they are doing is the pure technique

632
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,560
because it is flowing in that.

633
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,760
If they are moving their hand, there is a power flowing,

634
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,240
through them and they are working it out.

635
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,520
It's not just a acrobatic thing, that's going on.

636
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,440
So  the pure knowledge, for example, the way they are raising

637
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,960
is can......now in My presence.

638
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,800
And they themselves are realized souls, it's working out.

639
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,680
So this all, is the pure Vidya.

640
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,280
is the pure knowledge and pure technique.

641
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,120
And those who have not done this

642
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,720
have gone to such people

643
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,840
Put their head before them, kneel before them

644
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,360
have done something, which should not have been done.

645
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,240
So this is it, and that's how you catch on this.

646
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,480
Thumb, left hand, that's means

647
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,440
a person has been to somebody like this.

648
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,920
But with that if you have any catch on this void

649
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,880
or this void here in the stomach one,

650
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,120
This is left Swadishthana, this placed here down below.

651
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,520
Which moves like that all over here,

652
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,440
and this becomes right Swadisthana this.

653
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,400
Now, supposing a person catches all around here,

654
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,400
this Void and all around here.

655
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,160
is called as the Void, We call it Void.

656
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,560
Its not the Zen Void.

657
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,680
But the Void is the crossing point,

658
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,520
which is the Viscera, the stomach point

659
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,800
where abdomen, you can abdomen

660
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,120
and this part, if it is catching,that means, these are

661
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,520
The ten Principles of the guru.

662
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,440
If this is catching means,

663
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,000
you have hurt, your principle of guru.your guru.

664
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,920
Principle of a master.

665
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,120
That means you have gone to some very wrong man.

666
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,000
If this is catching, that means that now

667
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,120
Just now as they say, his Void is catching.

668
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,280
The Kundalini will be wobbling there.

669
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,560
You can see with your own eyes also.

670
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,600
You can see the Kundalini just,

671
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,600
poor things pulsating there, you can see

672
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,200
the whole stomach going into trauma.

673
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,320
and then you have to say the Mantra

674
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,760
of the Primordial Master, anyone you can do it, you see.

675
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,800
Guru Nanaka's name you can take.

676
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,240
Mohammad's name you can take.

677
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,760
All of them are Prophets, Moses name, Abraham

678
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,440
All these are there, so if you take their name,

679
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,480
The Kundalini can be brought up.

680
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,120
You can strengthen that part.

681
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,760
Then the Kundalini is pushed up.

682
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,400
So all these so called yoga's

683
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,440
also like physical yoga.

684
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,440
Now in the physical yoga, you will catch

685
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,600
catch this finger(right Agaya) and this finger(left heart)

686
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,760
This ring finger and this finger.

687
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,960
This is heart,

688
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,080
means you are paying too much attention to your physical thing.

689
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,640
Anybody who is working is too much physically can catch this.

690
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,640
Plus this (left Swadishthana)

691
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,320
because when you go into action too much also,

692
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,800
as a result of that fume of your actions

693
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,960
create your ego.

694
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,680
This is one of the biggest problem of the West.

695
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,400
You see, they are not aware of that they have ego.

696
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,880
But after realization they start seeing the balloon bloating.

697
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,400
They see and then come and tell Me.

698
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,560
Mother I am catching on my right Agaya,

699
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,120
It's a very delicate stuff,

700
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,560
you can't tell anybody

701
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,520
you have got ego, though you will have it.

702
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,040
So you have to be very careful, when you are talking.

703
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,840
But actually so many people felt there is ego in them.

704
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,800
So they took to,even people

705
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,320
When they feel they have too much ego,

706
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,600
they will take to alcoholism.

707
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,880
Because they are frighten of themselves,

708
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,720
they can't just bear them,they want to escape that.

709
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,960
So people are quite conscious.

710
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,400
But after realization  it becomes a

711
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,440
complete understanding

712
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,480
Because you start feeling a little pain sometime.

713
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,120
in this finger,and you feel a pain here.

714
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,960
and you know that you got this mystery, which is just coming up.

715
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,560
So then you know that how to twist it and take it out.

716
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,440
How to bring it out.

717
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,920
So you start understanding yourself and you start understanding.

718
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,520
I don't have to tell, you know yourself.

719
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,040
Now we have certain things like we use vibrated water.

720
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,520
For clearing your void, now what is vibrated water?

721
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,960
Water is nothing that but divine vibrations are put in.

722
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,400
And they go and start bombarding

723
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,000
that area and try to improve.

724
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,440
We have cured so many people of stomach cancer and all those.

725
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,240
Even we can cure

726
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,880
What you call blood cancer and things in Sahaja Yoga.

727
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,920
So many have been cured, you can cure.

728
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,120
You can do. No problem, you can do.

729
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,120
But what one has to do, to be steadily

730
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,520
mo0ving about in SahajaYoga, not for example.

731
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,960
You have a conception about Christ. Say for example.

732
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,480
Now that conception may not be the real conception of Christ.

733
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,640
May not be or may be so keep your eyes open.

734
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,320
Now what I say in Sahaja Yoga, you can verify.

735
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,000
But do not deny, first verify supposing you go as a

736
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,960
Scientist, you have to go and see for yourself.

737
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,920
Isn't it, you just don't deny at the gate door,

738
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,000
this cannot be done not be true because whatever you know

739
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,440
is your own conception, get inside, all right.

740
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,640
Now when you get inside keep your  eyes open and see for yourself.

741
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,800
And then once you start seeing it.

742
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,280
That's the best way is knowing because

743
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,680
what you see is through your vibratory awareness.

744
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,480
For example now I want to ask you a question.

745
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,320
say, Mother is the their God.

746
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,560
Just ask Me question thrice

747
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,920
and you will find the vibration will increase,it's a fact.

748
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,040
But if you ask about TM, you may start burning.

749
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,080
vibrations will stop, better ask about God,

750
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,840
so that we have vibrations.

751
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,680
Relatively you can understand it first.

752
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,520
like we had people there in Pune

753
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,600
and we had organized a program

754
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,520
and they announced it in the paper

755
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,480
and they suddenly discovered that I am not a Brahmin.

756
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,080
and they got very upset

757
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,600
and they said, you are not a Brahmin, I mean born Brahmin,

758
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,840
I mean, according to them, you can be realized soul born.

759
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,480
How can you be, You can be.

760
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,800
But every Brahmin not a realized soul at all.

761
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,840
on the contrary some are real devils.

762
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,880
and so they wanted to cancel My program.

763
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,800
I didn't know all this, nobody told Me,

764
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,080
But then they said if you would canceled this now,

765
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,400
It's out in the paper, everybody will know that you are,

766
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,400
a sought of of a...

767
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,120
Brahminic society.

768
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,800
Which is very dangerous in India. You are a secular state.

769
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,720
Say, we are also secular state.

770
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,600
Can not proclaim that we are a Brahmanic society and all that.

771
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,760
As we people cannot proclaim that we are racialist

772
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:51,760
in the same way,

773
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,920
I mean, under law you cannot, but I mean people can be, so

774
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,480
When you see, I was

775
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,480
They were meditating all of them, I gave a lecture there.

776
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,960
then these people, who were sitting there

777
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,200
in front of Me started shaking like this.

778
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,360
So I said, "Now why are you shaking?

779
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,720
They couldn't control themselves

780
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,280
Why are you shaking, so what?

781
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,600
So they said, Mother because you are the Shakti.

782
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,560
You are the power, that's why we are shaking.

783
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,560
I said, " Not that, others are not shaking, why are you shaking?

784
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,840
They said we are very powerful thatâ€™s why we have special energies.

785
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,960
and see these are shaking, this side.

786
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,080
I said, " Just go and ask, from where do they come.

787
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,440
and they all have come from Lunatic Asylum.

788
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,960
Those who are shaking, so I said, now you understand.

789
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,600
Why they are shaking haven, so they said,you mean say

790
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,000
, we are lunatic, I said," You are fanatic if not lunatic"

791
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,840
You see, so, then they started

792
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,160
now they are very great disciple of outâ€™s.

793
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,520
in the sense they are Sahaja Yogis

794
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,960
They  have got all the things  done  for us, they have given up

795
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,080
that Brahmanic ideas, their fanaticism, but

796
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,600
A sought of thing you will see yourself, what I am saying.

797
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,360
Now keep your brains intact,

798
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,880
don;t give away to anything.

799
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,360
Your brains are very important.

800
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,600
They understand thing and you can see things clearly

801
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,360
what's happening, keep your alertness

802
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,320
and see for yourself whats happening

803
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,360
But supposing if you use your brain all the time criticizing

804
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,000
because people who go to various things, say for a person

805
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,080
who goes to this, fat fellow,

806
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,600
who has taken fifty nine Rolls Royces now

807
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,400
They never question him,

808
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,640
They never asked him a question

809
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,760
Why do you need Rolls Royce?

810
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,760
when he sent about fifty lakhs, they starve themselves and sent,

811
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,800
They never questioned him.

812
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,200
But to Me, when they come, they will question ten times.

813
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,960
Why this, because you are free, I am happy,

814
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,520
you are free to question.

815
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,760
But too much questioning is not good, it doesn't help you.

816
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,720
Because I am not here for any Business.

817
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,280
No business is involved, so they asked,

818
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,120
question and questions and questions

819
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,760
about this gentleman

820
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,440
who has taken Rolls Royces after Rolls Royces

821
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,760
Can you imagine.?

822
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,960
English young people, can they afford all this?

823
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,720
In one year they had to give,

824
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,520
one another Rolls Royce to him.

825
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,960
Fifty nine thousand but, when they came from.

826
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,560
Where he said," You must surrender yourself to me,

827
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,680
you must do this, you must do that.

828
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:26,920
They came here and we said

829
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,960
that you are not to think too much.

830
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,720
Immediately that whole ego, that was suppressed came upon.

831
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,160
They said, "Oh you are doing the same thing to us.

832
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,520
But I said, For what I don't want any Rolls Royce?

833
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,200
Not even a bit of it.

834
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,160
So why should I do it,

835
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,680
The whole ego that was suppressed, you see.

836
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,960
They were all mad after him

837
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,160
One girl went to India.

838
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,800
She use to wash his bathroom.

839
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,640
with her tears, and clean with her hair.

840
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,200
Can you believe?

841
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,920
Just imagine!

842
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,720
Not only one but all kinds of things they use to do with.

843
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,000
and that one was, they were doing service to them.

844
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,960
Their guru, this that, that was all right.

845
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,440
Quite convinced, but when they came to Me

846
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,880
They wasted all their energy in arguing with Me.

847
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,440
And they started thinking,they are great SahajaYogis.

848
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,160
They have to organize everything.

849
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,160
They have to do this, they have to do that.

850
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,040
So very difficult situation.

851
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,400
It happens with so many of them, one girl came to stay with Me

852
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,280
In Oxstead, where I was living, in My own house.

853
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,920
Off she stayed, imagine, no payment, nothing

854
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,360
and so argumentative, she ate My head off, I was fed up.

855
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,480
I told her, I am sorry, I can't give you realization any more,

856
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,920
because you are only interested in pestering Me.

857
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,560
And had no patient, because I had to do something important.

858
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,240
She became so important

859
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,000
I asked her, "By the way tell Me,

860
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,720
how to develop this ego, from where?

861
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,920
She said, "I have no ego, I have surrendered it.

862
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,120
I said,"To whom?" She said, " She said we had a lama."

863
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,680
Lama, from Tibet.

864
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,600
And he sent a words, saying,

865
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,120
that unless and until you have the flooring

866
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,440
Marble flooring, I will not come.

867
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,920
So poor thing, they starve themselves made marvel flooring

868
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:24,000
for these parasites, they came down here.

869
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,440
They never made any money, they never worked.

870
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,000
You see these Lamas, useless people,

871
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:34,400
came down there and what was, they were told for one year,

872
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,680
they have to do only one sadhu, one prat ice.

873
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,320
They use to bow before

874
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,200
that horrible Lama, for 1001 times.

875
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,400
And they did it, after that.

876
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,600
Then she came to Me, naturally the whole ego that was

877
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,560
oppress with in just came on Me.

878
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,480
I am sorry, I couldn't give her realization, I must say.

879
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,840
couldn't, and I don't know, she is lost or what has happened.

880
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,120
But this is what it is, that this kind of things can happen there,

881
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,800
there are problems because of this wrong doings.

882
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,160
They all leave very deep dents within us.

883
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,800
So we must know that we have to get it all right.

884
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,640
We have to be concern about ourselves because we are seekers.

885
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,720
I have come here for yourself.

886
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,480
and the seeking has to be done, perfected

887
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,360
and we have to look after ourselves, we must love ourselves.

888
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,040
and we must have self esteem.

889
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,760
I say this, you should not have diffidence.

890
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,160
Oh God we have done all these things so whats going to happen

891
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,320
So you must have complete confidence, all right, first thing.

892
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,320
And second thing, you must know that these were wrong thing.

893
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,960
We are not going to do any more.

894
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,240
and we are going to be all right

895
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,560
so compromise yourself with yourself.

896
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,320
Don't struggle with yourself, it is important.

897
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,920
Because if you struggle with yourself, how are we to manage

898
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,760
There will be a big tussle going on within you.

899
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,560
So better compromise,

900
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,920
that you are seekers and you must get realization

901
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,520
There is very easy to make out a person, who is ego oriented.

902
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,960
For us, it may not be for you, but we never say that.

903
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,280
First of all your attention should be one one side.

904
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,160
If it is moving too much, then be careful.

905
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,040
Don't move your attention too much.

906
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,920
Doesn't work out, attention has to be on one side.

907
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,720
and try to put your attention one side, that's very important.

908
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,040
If your all attention is moving here and there,

909
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,400
that's our habit, you see

910
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,160
Somebody comes in, we must see, somebody goes out we must see.

911
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,320
What's the need?

912
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,960
Even the smallest thing happens, people will turn their eyes.

913
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,840
Try to put your eyes  in proper attention.

914
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,400
We are here, for our realization, for our emancipation.

915
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,160
For the emancipation of all the humanity.

916
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,760
And then you your become enlightened light.

917
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,560
You understand everything, this is your own power,which you use.

918
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,800
And you try to help others, it's as simple as that.

919
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:59,080
Now that's one point, which I told you, you cannot pay for it.

920
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,960
No you can not, it's something beyond, it's not.

921
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,440
The first you feel the all pervading power,

922
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,440
this cool breeze at your feeling is the.

923
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,960
is the all pervading power.Now people have talked about it.

924
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,480
Everybody even in Islamic religion if you see.

925
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,120
It's described as a Rooh.

926
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,040
Every religion has talked of this all pervading power.

927
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,200
Is the Brahama, In the sanskrit language is called as Brahama

928
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,600
Now once you start feeling it,

929
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,560
Then, it's the first time you have felt it,

930
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,920
but unless and until you use it, you will know

931
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:38,040
what it is like, for example a flower becomes a fruit.

932
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,120
You take it for granted, who does all this?

933
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,720
All the living work, imagine the tremendous kind,

934
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:49,400
of the choice that it manifest the way it works out.

935
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,640
See there are tree and trees and trees.

936
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,200
And how a particular tree gives a particular flower.

937
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,400
How it gives a particular fruit, how grows to particular height.

938
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,800
All this, who organize it, every moment.

939
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,160
There are billion and billions of flowers becoming fruits.

940
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,160
I will say, look at ourselves, our eyes how beautiful they are.

941
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,160
What a beautiful camera it is.

942
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,680
all this is done by whom?

943
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,760
There has to be some power who has done this. Isn't it?

944
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,920
We have become human beings, who has done this.

945
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,640
This power, this Brahama and this Brahama power is

946
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,760
now you are feeling for the first time.

947
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,280
But that makes your hands living

948
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,280
The attention comes here,

949
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,800
through your finger now, you will know everything.

950
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,080
Because your central Nervous system your nerves

951
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,280
have been enlighten by the spirit.

952
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,960
That's how the knowledge is your own.

953
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,800
You can verify within you, I asked this Peter Pears,

954
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,280
Who came as an Epileptic.

955
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,640
Spoiling on the street in a horrible condition.

956
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,920
He had to sell of his property everything.

957
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,960
His wife was the Dukes grand daughter and all that.

958
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,520
You should have seen in what condition he had come.

959
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,200
Actually you won't believe it, if I tell you

960
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,480
He had not a single pie left on him.

961
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,440
And he had stay with Me to get along in that.

962
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,880
And his wife, he is sitting here, he will tell you that.

963
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,280
The fact that they were left without a single pie.

964
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,360
Health was horrible, they had all kinds of health problems.

965
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,960
And still he never new that he was doing something wrong.

966
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,120
So I asked him, "How is it, you did not discover?

967
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,720
His wife was epileptic.

968
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,200
She use to get into epileptic things.

969
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,160
For three hours, she would be just screaming and shouting.

970
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,880
She would feel something is pulling her neck

971
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,320
and could not petrified

972
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,600
Three hours, such horrible state that reached.

973
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,320
Daughter was in a big mess.

974
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,880
She had become absolutely a lunatic personality.

975
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,640
still he never realized, why?

976
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,320
I asked him, "Why? with all your brains isn't it.

977
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,160
The intelligent man, very intelligent man.

978
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,600
She is a M.A, this that,

979
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,400
what's the use of all this intelligence.

980
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,920
If you cannot recognise these.

981
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,760
Till you finish every pie, every drop of your blood,

982
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,800
Why were you continuing with that.

983
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,960
So he told Me that it was like a blanket.

984
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,960
We did not know, which side we were moving.

985
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,480
Every time he was trying some sought of trick on us.

986
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,720
You have to do better thing and you have to this course,

987
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,560
that course and paying money for us.

988
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,680
And that's how we collapsed and we did not know

989
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:40,800
till we reach this stage, where we found we have nothing,

990
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,600
The other day somebody from Muktanand came,

991
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,920
he was with him for sixteen years

992
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,680
and he said that, luckily  Mother

993
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,480
I fell in love with an Indian girl in New York,

994
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,960
And she told me that if you are a yogi

995
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,680
You don't look like a yogi at all,

996
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,720
who is given you initiation and all that.

997
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,280
If you have a Kundalini jagruti( Awakenning),

998
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,840
if you are a realized soul.

999
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:04,040
You should be blooming, you should have radiance on your face.

1000
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,120
It should be evident,

1001
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,720
people should see that you are a person of that radiance.

1002
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,960
There is no radiance, you have such a sallow face.

1003
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,360
Thin down absolutely, looks a sick man

1004
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,720
And how is it and she is the one, who told me this not possible.

1005
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,240
Now you just pray to God, God take me to right path.

1006
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,680
And you just won't believe into all these things,

1007
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,680
she didn't know about Me or anything

1008
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:27,840
but she said, this is not the way.

1009
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,480
What we know of yogi is like that.

1010
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,920
Now you just don't believe into these crooks.

1011
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,600
Those who are taking money from you,

1012
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,120
and look at your condition, sixteen years, what did you get.

1013
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,800
They have powers like this,

1014
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,600
the people who are realized souls.

1015
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,960
Know about other people, they have collective consciousness.

1016
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,480
You don't have any collective consciousness or anything.

1017
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,240
She was just student a

1018
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,560
and she knew about it, these things in India

1019
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,600
They are not naive, they know what it is.

1020
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,240
He say, he didn't even,

1021
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,760
he was told that I have awakened your Kundalini,

1022
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,320
he use to just jump.

1023
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,680
And he use to take drugs, this and that

1024
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,880
he could not get over that drug business.

1025
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,240
She said, " How can you be a yogi, what are you talking?"

1026
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,000
How do you believe such nonsense, She said, "First get well."

1027
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,120
You have no job, nothing, you are starving now.

1028
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,920
And he was thrown away from Ashram, when his money was finished.

1029
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,400
And you are living in the charities of the government.

1030
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,240
I don't want to marry such a man, who is a parasite....

1031
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,440
You just go away to India and find out the right answer, then

1032
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,280
He came to London, one of our Sahaja Yogi is a travel agent.

1033
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,080
He went there and saw My photograph.He said, "Who is this?"

1034
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,480
He said, It's Mother, He said, Mother I heard.

1035
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,400
There is one Anand Mayi Maa in India,

1036
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:40,880
where I am going to see her.

1037
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,600
He said, "Please don't go and see her

1038
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,320
because my father and mother both ruined by her.

1039
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,160
and we are absolutely, he was a very big man and

1040
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,400
his father was really,

1041
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,120
I don't know what happened to intelligent people in India.

1042
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,000
Because they are westernized you see,

1043
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,240
They don't want to know anything about God or anything,

1044
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,080
The right way, they are so westernized

1045
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,040
they want to know through English people.

1046
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,120
So their knowledge is like this,

1047
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,040
all the plutocrat are that way

1048
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,880
Built up that way, they will read all English books about Gita.

1049
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,520
Because they don't know Sanskrit, They donâ€™t want to know directly

1050
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,320
they want to know through some English Author.

1051
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,640
Who has written about Gita, because all are English biased, now

1052
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:21,040
so he told that don't go this lady, but Mataji is here.

1053
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,680
But I don't know if you can meet her because she is very busy.

1054
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,280
May be, she may not meet up, but one thing,

1055
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,440
you can do it,  just dart into her house.

1056
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,320
And just tell her that Mother, I am a seeker

1057
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,440
and Dinesh has send me and sixteen years I have been with Muktanand

1058
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,480
She definitely will have compassion.

1059
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,320
I was about to go out somewhere.

1060
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,440
When suddenly I find him in the reception room,

1061
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,200
Just say, somebody stand, he  just said, Mother!

1062
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,440
Please save me, I have been to Muktanand for sixteen years.

1063
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,040
Then I said really! I canceled my going out.

1064
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,640
I said just a minute, sit down,

1065
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,360
We worked on him, he got his realization,

1066
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,840
And in Australia I hope to meet him sometime.

1067
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,960
He is in a big mess, because you see I told him

1068
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,040
We told him, you cannot retain your things.

1069
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,480
Because he is booked he had to go away.

1070
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,760
I said, tomorrow if you wait, at least we can work it out.

1071
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,360
But he had to leave,hardly three hours left.

1072
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,800
So I said, Now it's all right we will see it,

1073
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,800
but that's what I am saying, it is like that.

1074
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,680
We must have right understanding about God

1075
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:28,360
and right understanding about ourselves what should we have.

1076
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,160
and the ego should be controlled in a way that in sahaja yoga

1077
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,720
There is nothing that you have to give.

1078
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,840
Somebody said,"you have to surrender, they got a fright.

1079
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,920
I said, What you surrender,what do you have?your ego.

1080
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,200
surrender your ego, that's all to God.

1081
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,920
Surrender your ego,ego is a stupid thing.

1082
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:57,640
What do we do, what do we do, let's  see, at the most.

1083
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,040
Whatever is dead, convert it into something.

1084
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,960
Whatever is available, you make a mic this thing.

1085
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:08,480
This thing, this that but can we make even a particle of dust.

1086
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,720
Can we make ourselves, on our own.

1087
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,320
We don't do that, we do dead work, can we make?

1088
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,600
A fruit out of a flower.

1089
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,840
What do we do? Why to have ego but rationally we understand

1090
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,480
but it is there you see existing, so we have to work it out.

1091
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,960
It's very simple in Sahaja Yoga, when are realized.

1092
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,200
How to put it down, the ego part.

1093
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,000
it is very simple.

1094
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,880
you have to just turn left side to your right and bring it down.

1095
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,360
You do it thrice it will go down, quite a bit.

1096
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,200
but you should be a realized soul, if you are not realized,

1097
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,920
It won't work because your vibrations must flow

1098
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,000
and the vibrations just take it down

1099
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,880
because they are subtle things.

1100
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,880
They are subtle things, they go inside, they work it out

1101
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,880
with  subtlity subtely take it out that ego.

1102
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,680
because It's a subtle thing within your head ,

1103
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,440
and they are even subtler then ego

1104
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,440
So take it down and push it out, You can do your self.

1105
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,920
So you become the Doctor.

1106
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,000
You become the instrument, you become the Pathologist,

1107
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,320
you become the medicine.

1108
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,960
For yourself and for others, that's what you should happen.

1109
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,160
You must have your own powers, if you go to a guru.

1110
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,440
You just won't paying him money.

1111
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,920
What powers have you got, just judge it on that one.

1112
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,200
What have you got? you have fought with your father,

1113
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,400
fought with mother, fought with wife,

1114
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,040
everywhere you have created a problem for yourself.

1115
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,760
There is no relationship with the whole society

1116
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,200
even these stair  people everyone even afraid of a garlic

1117
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,080
Do you know that?

1118
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,720
You show them a garlic, they will start jumping.

1119
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,960
I mean, imagine to be afraid,

1120
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,040
of something of vegetable.

1121
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,560
You have to be a powerful personality.

1122
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,360
That doesnâ€™t mean you aggress anybody, you do not aggress anybody.

1123
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,520
But you are a powerful person in your love.

1124
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,320
Love is the most powerful thing and most effective,

1125
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,440
but love also doesnâ€™t mean the way

1126
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,400
this fellow talks of this your..

1127
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,760
fourteen year old fellow about love.

1128
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,720
Go mad after him,you see singing together,

1129
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,560
What's this, he has created such a mess for?

1130
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,160
They are all getting mad,

1131
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,000
All will end up into lunatic asylum or in the hospital.

1132
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,480
All get either Cancers or

1133
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,240
multiple sclerosis, all sorts of diseases.

1134
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,280
When they come to Me at the last stage, when the discover, Oh God

1135
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,280
For somebody got multiple psoriasis and he went to a Doctor

1136
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,960
He was surprised, he was surfing this guru for so many years.

1137
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,520
And how did he get and then he comes to Me.

1138
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,160
Then he realizes for

1139
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,960
What to do, you see people must go through the whole,

1140
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,880
the whole experiences are such extremist that

1141
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,640
unless until they are completely ripped off, all there.

1142
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,920
things, they don't come to Sahaja Yoga.

1143
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,400
But some are, they were  intelligent, they understand.

1144
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,560
and at a point they just give up.

1145
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,280
Whatever be the state, doesnâ€™t matter

1146
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,960
you are seeker, we have to work out.

1147
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,680
Everyone has to work out. All the Sahaja Yogi have to work out.

1148
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,640
But that help should not challenge your ego.It's a help.

1149
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,720
because you are part and parcel of us.

1150
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,960
If this finger is paining if I rub it.

1151
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,600
Then I am not trying to help you I am helping Myself.

1152
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,720
If I am helping you, I am helping myself.

1153
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,040
Because something of Me is paining.

1154
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,640
Which I have to help, nobody is there.

1155
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,880
In Sahaja Yoga there is nobody, who is the other.

1156
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,840
You are all one, just now you are not enlightened.

1157
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,760
doesn't matter, we get you enlightened.

1158
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,560
But we are all one, only thing what you have to become is

1159
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,360
enlightened one. Once you are enlightened,

1160
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,080
then you become collectively conscious,

1161
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,280
then you realized that you are the one

1162
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,400
Of the whole, you become, its all again you become

1163
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,840
You become a realized soul.

1164
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,120
and you become collectively conscious.

1165
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,040
You are become conscious that

1166
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,200
you are part and parcel of the whole.you become.

1167
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,760
Don't have to form a UN or some sorts of things.

1168
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:08,120
Just become, your awareness becomes.

1169
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:13,480
That should be so easy, so logically you understand Sahaja Yoga.

1170
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,400
Because your brain, after coming from all these experience

1171
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,360
just starts judging Sahaja Yoga. So can understand it logic.

1172
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:22,480
After that you must know that

1173
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,480
When the Kundalini passes over Agaya Chakra,

1174
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,840
you become thoughtless.

1175
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:31,760
Means there is a space in between the thoughts, one thought rises

1176
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,680
another arises passes down, there is a space in between.

1177
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,720
those two thoughts and that is place, where you have to reach.

1178
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,280
Once you are there, you are thoughtlessly aware.

1179
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,600
This is called as Nirvichar Samadhi, where you go and become

1180
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:50,680
thoughtlessly aware, Nirvichar Samadhi.

1181
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,560
And then when the Kundalini pears es through here.

1182
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,960
Absolutely pears es and comes out very well.

1183
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,160
You can give realization moving your hands just liken this,

1184
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,760
it flows from your hands.

1185
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,840
It's true, It looks like testing, but you can give realization.

1186
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,160
Once the Kundalini has pears you can.

1187
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,320
but there are temptations, people have

1188
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,960
become egoistical,they think they are great all that, is not true.

1189
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,440
You have just become conscious of being part and parcel.

1190
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:27,200
If you understand that, that you have now become

1191
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,720
entitle to use this power of compassion of God

1192
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,440
power of his love, through you, you can maneuver it.

1193
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,480
know how to handle it, you are the instrument which understands

1194
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,160
and that's how, you become the spirit now,

1195
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,240
because the spirit is the connection.

1196
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,800
It's so wonderful afterward your health

1197
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,920
I mean your doctor's pills goes to zero.

1198
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,360
You never get bored, you are always employed

1199
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,160
You have no time, for anything, you are a very busy person.

1200
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,960
My little grand child was hardly five years,

1201
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,480
once we went to the airport, very busy, like this, like this.

1202
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,720
so My daughter asked," What are you doing?"

1203
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,680
Why are you so busy, so don't talk just now.

1204
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,560
She said, "What are you doing." She is a born realized child.

1205
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,680
Very much knowledgeable, she knows a lot about Sahaja Yoga,

1206
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,400
from her childhood from her birth.

1207
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:26,960
Now done. What? I was tying the whole of

1208
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,720
Whole of airport, is very messy place.

1209
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,440
So they are busy people you see, you become busy too

1210
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,040
because you know it, you know the problem, you are there.

1211
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:44,040
They start doing it. How are you? Better.

1212
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:51,800
Put him left to the right.

1213
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,160
Sound! you have sound in the ear.

1214
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:10,640
You got some oil here, Olive oil or something

1215
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,120

1383
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:20,000
So that the fingers are sought of supple,

1384
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,120
to feel the vibrations

1385
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:24,280
because nerves can be, you do such hard work here, you see

1386
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,960
with our fingers,

1387
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,720
It can be,and use your gloves

1388
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:29,400
when ever you are doing any hard work.

1389
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,920
to keep the fingers more sought of sensitive

1390
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,280
see our sensitivity also sought of lost.

1391
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,080
So we have to be careful, all right.

1392
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,400
These are, these you put together, there

1393
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:46,280
I will tell you what's .....

1394
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,280
This is sugar, Yogi: salt,salt.

1395
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,720
Take it out, how you take out salt here.

1396
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,640
You can't push it back.

1397
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,520
Can you open this? Yes you can, I think.

1398
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:02,120
Just take it out.

1399
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,600
I will do it for them, all of them one by one.It's all right.

1400
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:06,880
Can you open it.

1401
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,440
Not suppose to come out, is it?

1402
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:25,960
All right, good idea.

1403
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:31,560
I vibrate it, use this for your dandruff

1404
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,240
Add this salt, anywhere you use salt, specially

1405
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,720
for your gargling and all that, this is very good.

1406
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,680
Keeps your throat all right to gargling.

1407
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,600
Every morning will be a good idea.

1408
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,080
And also good for your teeth,

1409
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,080
you see, you mix up little bit of that.

1410
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,640
Olive oil with this and you see you rub gums with.

1411
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,960
It's very good for your teeth, all right

1412
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,320
We have to look after our body very much

1413
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:00,520
but in such a way that it is

1414
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:05,320
attended to in a proper way, in a methodical way, all right.

1415
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,520
never, see show you.

1416
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,560
Sugar is because

1417
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:16,760
See we we have liver problems, most of us have liver problem.

1418
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,800
And that's why the sugar is vibrated.

1419
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:31,080
If you can open there thing I can give it to every one.

1420
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:34,640
This I am explaining for everyone.

1421
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:37,720
So you will ....,It's all right, now this

1422
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:41,240
Lemon add this, for sugar, any sugar.

1423
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:43,400
She take sugar, as much as she can

1424
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,360
But if they Yer says, you have liver,

1425
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,000
then you should take little extra sugar

1426
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,160
But you mix it up with other sugar.

1427
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,320
SM: Go on mixing that. Y: I see.

1428
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:52,960
SM: It can be added up. Y: Yes yes.

1429
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,200
These lemon, these lemons are

1430
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:58,440
something very good, they absorb My vibrations very fast.

1431
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,120
Y: Yes. SM:  Now these are very good.

1432
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:02,880

01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:04,800
right hand sided and the

1434
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:06,760
seven for the left hand side.

1435
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,320
You have to put them under your pillow or

1436
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,040
I mean the pillow side.

1437
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:14,680
under ground with this plastic bag

1438
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:18,120
opened up in the night and closed in the day time.

1439
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:21,680
You use it for seven nights, it sucks in all your negativity.

1440
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,320
surprising its wonderful.

1441
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,440
I have cure many mad people with this,

1442
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:27,560
epilepsy and all that, it's wonderful thing.

1443
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:29,800
Lemons are very good you see.

1444
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,800
and morning time you close it.

1445
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,720
and then the whole thing should be thrown.

1446
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,120
After using it for seven nights.

1447
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:42,160
into the river.

1448
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,920
or somewhere it goes out, that's all.

1449
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,360
This will take away all the negativity you have.

1450
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,880
take out that.

1451
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:57,760
Can you out this, now open that one.

1452
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,560
If you can open that one.

1453
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,880
This is a very wonderful thing.

1454
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,720
Try this, it will make you very light and nice

1455
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,600
You will feel very happy, just now you close it down.

1456
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:19,960
How will you take this, can you give her a plastic thing

1457
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:24,960
close it down

1458
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,200
Its good for you to gargle

1459
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:38,160
because of Vishuddhi, you see,

1460
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:41,720
Vishuddhi is very bad, you have to gargle yourself,

1461
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,800
Now I would request somebody can, can anyone?

1462
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,680
Can any one fix his neck here.

1463
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,720
You can, all right, just fix that

1464
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:53,760
All right, Doctor you do it.

1465
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:56,560
Now what you do is to.

1466
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,120
leave you neck very very light,

1467
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,560
Say just not put any pressure on it.

1468
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:05,160
Just put both the hands towards Me straight.

1469
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,560
straight like this. Yes

1470
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,320
Be kept here, just put  it, be relaxed.

1471
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:19,080
Now this one is good for his gargling.

1472
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,400
They may need some plastic bags I think

1473
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,280
Put your hands towards Me.

1474
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,520
No no just fix that fast.

SM: Very heavy? Y :very stiff. SM : Very stiff, is it?

01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,080

01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:27,360
It's Very heavy, is it?

1479
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,600
Good, both sides.

1480
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,480
Good now, sit down, Check the vibrations.

1481
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,280
use a proper pillow for yourself, all right.

1482
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,280
Never twist the pillow, make the pillow nice one.

1483
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:47,520
not too high, not too low, just in the center.

1484
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,200
You say about, should not be more then five inches.

1485
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:54,080
Yes, better.

1486
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:01,840
Five to six inches, that's all, better now, are you feeling?

1487
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:04,800
Great, all right.

1488
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:09,280
And also next time we will give you the mantra.

1489
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,680
Or can you give him the mantra now, Maharishi mardini.

01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,320
And also for the neck, it's all right, you can give.

1491
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,960
Now this one is very important for you specially

Right they will tell you what  is to be done,

You are great seekers you see, despite all this.

Are you all right, don't get worried, you brought some oil?

1499
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:47,800
Have you got some Amla oil.

Put your right hand on your heart.

1507

And say Mother, I am the spirit.It will work out,

1508
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,280
because of that Saharara not opening.

1509
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:27,880
Shiva's place is here (Sahasrara) right one.

1510
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,920
Just see now, on the head, you

1511

Not too much, Yes better.

1514
01:36:56,440 --> 01:37:00,160
This is what oil? Pentine.

1515
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:06,240
It's an oil, uses this for rubbing on the shoulder.SM: Is it?

And also use it for your head, will be good.

1517
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,120
For the,for the shoulder you should bring actually.

1518
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,640
something like camphor oil or

1519
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,440
something like that is better yes.

1520
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:24,280
Or olive oil, but this one is good for hair.

1521
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,800
All right, very good. Should we try something on

1522
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:31,920
come here, just come, I will use a little for him.

1523
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:33,280
all right for him if you don't mind.

1524
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,160
This I vibrated just, come here in front.

1525
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,280
Come little a head still closer.

1526
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:45,320
Oh My God, It's so hot.

1527
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,640
Oh My God, so much heat is coming out.

1528
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:50,440
All the heat. Yogi: This is what my mother says.

1529
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:55,640
Now it is getting cooler.

1530
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,800
Such heat ! Oh

1531
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:09,600
Indians understand things so better

1532
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,920
You don't have to tell them.

1533
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:15,480
They know what it is, they know the importance of feet.

1534
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,720
You see it's very simple to tell them

1535
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,800
with other people, one has to be carefully, interducing the subject.

1536
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,800
This with Indians, go head long, they know everything.

1537
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:38,520
Are you all right now?

1538
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,480
It's too hot, it all happened due to this.

1539
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:45,440
Whatever you have done, It will pass off

1540
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:50,840
Take a photo from us and put one hand towards the photo.

1541
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:54,640
and the other hand outside, it will go out, it is much better.

1542
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:58,840
Are you feeling better, is it cooling, is it good?

1543
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:04,680
Void is also caught badly.

1544
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:17,200
Put your hand under the feet.

1545
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:33,680
All right.

1546
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:40,040
That his Kundalini wobbling absolutely down below.

1547
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:55,480
That all right.

1548
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:31,960
Humm better

1549
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:49,360
Now see, feeling better, put your hand on your head.

1550
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:59,200
Humm is it all right?

1551
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:03,200
Not yet come? Y: No.

1552
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:09,600
Mother: It will come. Yogi: What is blocking, What is bl;blocking?

1553
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,040
Y : What is stopping. SM :In this you know.

1554
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:17,320
you have gone to different places.These people mesmerize you.

1555
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:20,000
Put your hand behind, this side.

1556
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:45,880
Now ask a question, Mother, Are you Mataji Nirmala Devi?

1557
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:58,440
SM: Is it there. Yogi: Yes a little bit.

1558
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,440
Left hand towards the photograph and the other hand outside.

1559
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:07,360
Left hand towards the photograph and right hand outside,

1560
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:09,400
You have catch in your left side.

1561
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:16,440
Emotion, emotional thing, but it comes from horrible things

1562
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,000
you have been to, see they give you emotional problem.

1563
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:23,160
Left side, it is all impure knowledge.

1564
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,160
Better.

1565
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,080
Humm better.

1566
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:42,760
Are you unhappy with me?

1567
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:44,640
Haa ha, I am unhappy.

1568
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,400
I am not unhappy, but they are  stupid.

1569
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:49,280
Let everybody go there, thing may improve(sarcastically She says).

1570
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:58,000
Now it has come, it is all right.

1571
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:03,120
Improving, keep coming here, are you living near by?

1572
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,440
Now go, look after him, Y: OK. May God bless you.

1573
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:14,960
Y: Sted will export brown sugar

1574
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:21,800
But it is all right for him, he has a right Nabhi.

1575
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,440
He is left, left, I am sorry

1576
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,280
He has a left liver, what you call that

1577
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:31,320
is a cold liver, so put, it's all right.

1578
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:35,040
left to the right, right to the left, in this case.

1579
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,400
Right, do have allergies or something, you catch cold

1580
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:42,200
Y: I got a frozen shoulder.

1581
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:45,560
All right, can you take out your coat, I will fix that.

1582
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:53,400
Another thing is, no guru works anything.

1583
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:55,840
They just sit down on this seventh floor.

1584
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:58,880
Just that, move that side.

1585
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:02,240
and put your, just sit down here.

1586
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,160
Move that side, face that side and sit down.

1587
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:08,880
Just place that side, all other side.

1588
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:12,440
put this on the mother earth.

1589
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:52,400
All right, Better, are you feeling the relief.Y: Yes I am.

1590
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,760
You are feeling it, all right.

1591
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,600
Now you take My photograph, all right,

1592
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,120
put a candle in front of it, put your left hand

1593
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,480
towards the photograph and right hand on the mother earth.

1594
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:11,320
She will suck your problems.

1595
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:16,720
Arthritis can be cured, yes

1596
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,040
Lift your hand still frozen.

1597
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:23,520
up to what point, doesn't take

1598
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:29,640
put it on the ground.

1599
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:41,560
How is he? All right ?

1600
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,680
Feeling the cool breeze, how about this lady?

1601
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:49,480
What about the lady there?

1602
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:51,800
Y: Doesn't want it Mother. SM: she is all right.

1603
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,000
Doesn't want it. SM, I could see that.

1604
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:58,400
You have too much ego My child in you? Why did you come here?

1605
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:02,800
If you didn't want it, why did you come here?

1606
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:07,120
Y: She understand. S M: Understand what?

1607
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:12,720
Can you understand God? What is there to understand?

1608
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:16,600
You see your intelligence is limited.

1609
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:20,040
your rationality is limited, your mind is limited.

1610
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:22,680
We are talking about unlimited.

1611
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,640
It is like trying to understand

1612
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:31,280
Histology without getting seeing through the microscope.

1613
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:36,080
Can't understand anything, you don't want your self realization.

1614
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:38,480
Why?  you don't want it

1615
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:44,960
What is it

1616
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:49,480
What, more about what?

1617
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:52,400
But you should getting of first of all,

1618
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:54,640
otherwise how will you know.

1619
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:57,560
They just said Me, Isn't it absurd.

1620
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,400
Isn't it now

1621
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:02,160
Isn't it absurd, don't you think so?

1622
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:04,480
Unless and until you will get it how will you know

1623
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:06,920
Because I can't tell you why are moving hands like this.

1624
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:09,200
you don't  can't feel anything, what can we do,

1625
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:11,200
you must get your realization, better get it.

1626
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,240
All right, there is no question of understanding it.

1627
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:16,520
That rationality how far can you go?

1628
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:20,320
SM :Yes. Y: She says she can feel it."

1629
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,720
you are feeling what cool breeze?

1630
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:24,920
Yes, what she says.

1631
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:30,160
She said, she is asking whether it's, whether it's

1632
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:33,480
inside already, why does she need to get it.

1633
01:47:35,120 --> 01:47:36,720
What makes you think, it is inside.

1634
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,440
Is everybody has it but it is not manifesting, isn't it?

1635
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,600
Is it there you feel so?

1636
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:51,040
Do you feel you have got, you are all ready a realized soul?

1637
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:53,920
You think so, you think so?

1638
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:59,240
SM :What she says. This is thought particular when you born Mother.

1639
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,480
She is asking,  doesn't God put it there when you are born.

1640
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:04,320
Yes it is always there within you.

1641
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:07,560
All right as a human being you have it. but it's not manifesting.

1642
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:10,520
It has to manifest.

1643
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:15,760
SM: How did? Y: How can you give it to her Mother? SM: No I can't

1644
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,720
It's your own, it's not, you see like one light.

1645
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:20,280
which is enlighten

1646
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,280
Enlightens another light.

1647
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:23,880
It nothing giving.

1648
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:26,520
You understand that.

1649
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:31,320
Then you can't, because can  a light, which is not enlightened

1650
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,560
can be enlightened and what's the harm if I give you.

1651
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:35,360
I am not hitting you hard.

1652
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:37,480
I am doing anything wrong thing, what's wrong.

1653
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,800
If I want to give you a present, won't you have it?

1654
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,440
You will definitely have.

1655
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,520
Where you have fought?

1656
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:51,560
Y : What exactly you are doing Mother?

1657
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:54,080
Because that's the trouble, you are wearing us

1658
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,560
we are wearing for all of us. Not only for,

1659
01:48:57,320 --> 01:48:59,680
But you are wearing us all, means we are,

1660
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:03,720
we never likes  such people here, those who are egoistical.

1661
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:06,600
See if you have to get it, you better get

1662
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:08,440
otherwise don't come here.

1663
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:18,080
She must be told that she has to get it first time Mother.

1664
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:21,400
Not first time but at least try, you can't say no.

1665
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:22,880
It's not, this is the place

1666
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:25,200
where we give self realization to people.

1667
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:28,320
Not because you style our vibrations by this way.

1668
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:30,560
It is not for argument or anything,

1669
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:32,600
if you don't at least  leave us alone.

1670
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,120
Everybody has to get it otherwise you go away.

1671
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:37,760
Why to waste our energy, every bodies energy

1672
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:40,240
You don't want to do it, you don't want to trouble us.

1673
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:42,920
You are, I am telling you that.

1674
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:46,360
It is for us to decide this, is it? Yes of course.

1675
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,000
These are our premises, we know which people are troubling us.

1676
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,560
Yes I invited you not to trouble Me,

1677
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:55,560
Because we asked you to put, what we want to do.

1678
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:56,920
You should do otherwise you should go away.

1679
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,520
Why are you here, I mean, supposing you go to a place

1680
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:03,160
You can not do what you like, you have to do

1681
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:06,520
You you if you don't understand

1682
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:08,080
After what I have talked,

1683
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,080
you can never understand, we are sorry.

1684
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:11,800
You can never understand,

1685
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:13,200
you are not the one, who wants to understand

1686
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:15,760
You are not the type to understand,

1687
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,440
what is so harming in putting your hands.

1688
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:19,240
You are not going to be killed, are you going to be killed,

1689
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:21,240
What's going to be happen?

1690
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:23,600
I mean you enter any pub you want to,

1691
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:25,640
You want to talk to any man, you want to

1692
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:27,840
What is the harm in putting your hands like this?

1693
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:29,840
What's the thing, that's going to happen?

1694
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:36,040
Beg a pardon.You didn't want. Y: Say there is  any harm in it.

1695
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:40,040
Then why didn't you do, why are telling no to people.

1696
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:45,600
All right, first time you may not have it, but we have to try.

1697
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,280
You see if you just don't do it now, when will you do it.

1698
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:53,040
We are not going to waste our time, all right, this is it.

1699
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:55,840
You are not so important to us

1700
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,760
that you must get your realization.

1701
01:50:58,160 --> 01:50:59,960
But one thing if you are not taking your realization

1702
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:02,440
and you are just putting your force here

1703
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:05,880
You are spoiling, the energies of others, no doubts

1704
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:09,160
You will understand if get your realization.

1705
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:11,400
Otherwise you won't, that's the trouble with you.

1706
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:14,920
You don't want to get your realization how will you understand

1707
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:18,080
You see you cannot do like this, wherever you go,

1708
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:22,000
you have to according to the place you are going

1709
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:25,720
supposing you go to the Church and you take out your hat

1710
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:28,040
if you are man, if you are lady, you have to wear your hats.

1711
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:30,960
You see that also you will do there but not here,

1712
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,600
Here you want to take your liberties for everything, how can you?

1713
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:36,400
What say?

1714
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:41,120
What do you want to understand, what do you want to understand.

1715
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:43,400
And so far you have been saying I am on twenty seven, what?

1716
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:52,200
You see that is true but it is not abandonment, it's not madness.

1717
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,240
It's too different from Church all together but it doesn't mean.

1718
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:59,240
It doesn't mean that you can just come here and sit and watch

1719
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:02,360
everyone like inspector general, it's not so.

1720
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:04,400
Then why why did you come?

1721
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:07,080
You see, you have come for this purpose for self realization,

1722
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:08,160
All right

1723
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:13,680
Who who, who, just a minute, who told you that?

1724
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:17,080
What, which one he what a sister?

1725
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,280
I was very val...

1726
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:24,000
What did you tell her that you here and watch?

1727
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:30,400
He said, He told too much, Mother, That's why she got ruined.

1728
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,680
That's what I say that with rationality see if you tell them

1729
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:36,440
they get off, don't tell them too much.

1730
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:39,600
They come, they think they are inspector general come here

1731
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:41,520
To see everyone.

1732
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:43,720
Too much you told, you should not.

1733
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:45,880
I told you many a times not to talk too much.

1734
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:48,840
Because ego is such it sits on your head

1735
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:52,000
They suddenly becomes inspector General, see

1736
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:55,480
That's the trouble with them.Now better, are you.

1737
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:59,240
It's much better now. Good, see

1738
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:02,520
Now see this, listen here, you are going, listen here.

1739
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:06,280
She this gentleman's hand is now better, did you see that.

1740
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:10,520
Now do you want to understand that, how it has happened.

1741
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:27,280
You see, in this country

1742
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,160
In this country the ego is so much.

1743
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,520
That you don't know, how to and what extent it can go.

1744
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:37,360
We had in our house the guest, who was the chairman

1745
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:41,000
of the High Court judges of  Hail.

1746
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:44,040
Now believe it, what a man he must be.

1747
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:47,000
And we had a garbage cleaner, who came to our house.

1748
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:51,000
I asked in that, this little more you have to take.

1749
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:53,520
So I will give you some extra money, please take it today.

1750
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,640
So he said, "you don't understand the laws of this country

1751
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:00,000
You don't understand this, I need more money,

1752
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:03,480
this  that he was shouting, so he came out, this gentleman

1753
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,200
He said, "why are you shouting, what is the matter?"

1754
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:07,400
You Indians, you don't understand any law at all

1755
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:09,480
He is the man who is international laws

1756
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,120
You see, he is the chairman of all the thing,

1757
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:13,920
he was looking at him.

1758
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:16,360
And I just reel into laughter, see I couldn't see this.

1759
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:20,160
Garbage cleaner talking to him, so much ego.

1760
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:22,240
Ego, this is ego, you know this is stupidity,

1761
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,600
the edocity just see, so clear.

1762
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:27,960
The way she was talking to Me, at least she must be a

1763
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,760
Maha Yogi to talk like that.

1764
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:32,720
Any one of it? Isn't it.

1765
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:35,400
But here in this country you see, nobody is shameful of it.

1766
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:37,320
There is no humility.

1767
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:41,680
Even the President of India will stand, when I go to see him.

1768
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:44,760
You will be amazed, he would not sit till I sit down.

1769
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:49,360
They have this innate humility, look at this boy,

1770
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,360
he came and just said, I must touch your feet.

1771
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:56,160
See this is the course of all western civilization.

1772
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:58,880
Then only the people,who mesmerize them, we bowed to them.

1773
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:03,240
Those who be fool us we bow to them. Isn't it.

1774
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:06,840
We should understand, " this is a course of our country, be careful.

1775
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:10,680
Be careful, look at her the way she was talking.

1776
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:14,080
She was not interested anything.

1777
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:16,120
she came just to see and understand

1778
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:18,160
Who is she to understand, I don't understand this.

1779
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:20,080
What does she think about herself.

1780
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:26,320
Where is her brother? US, PHD.

1781
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,520
Poor thing I am sorry.Where is he gone?

1782
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:40,120
I you are invited, you can not do what you laugh.

1783
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:49,440
Much better,now Lets see, hold My hand tight and that put down

1784
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:59,120
Better, keep your right hand upwards.

1785
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:02,400
Like this, you have weakness in your left side.

1786
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:07,840
Better, left is weak.

1787
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:14,000
Mother: flowing  do you feel the energy flowing.Y: Much better.

1788
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:22,960
This is nothing, we had drunkard, you see, who are with Me.

1789
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:29,000
Much more then this.

1790
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:31,840
Very Road  chaap( very cheap), get the top his voice.

1791
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:35,000
But first I didn't know that he was a drunkard as person.

1792
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:37,640
They told Me, Mother he is a drunkard.

1793
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:39,520
I said," All right, let him talk."

1794
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:41,280
It's a good certificate for Me.

1795
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:44,800
What's that, now it's all right,

1796
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:46,840
And how much time they waste of others, you see.

1797
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:50,800
As if she doesn't want to do, you can ask her to go.

1798
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:54,280
Please go away, why are you sitting here.

1799
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:56,520
Very humbly you should say, better go away, sorry, you go away.

1800
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,800
She has just waste every bodies energy, what  she thinks of herself.

1801
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:13,880
Y : She was a saint.SM: I don't know.

1802
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,960
Its nothing but simple ego, you cannot explain it.

1803
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:19,680
See that's very stupid thing

1804
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:21,920
.It's ego and that's leads you to edocity

1805
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:24,560
That's why the sensitivity is so low.

1806
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:26,560
You see can not  make out.

1807
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:31,920
See even from the face they cannot make out.

1808
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:36,160
anything it's insensitive, they don't understand beauty, nothing.

1809
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:39,120
Nothing they understand, if you are insensitive, it happens.

1810
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:41,840
How are you now? Now!

1811
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:44,080
Better Yes! Haa ha ha

1812
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,520
May God bless you. Take it now.

1813
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:53,200
So happy to see you here, very happy, you are so much better.

1814
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:56,320
May God bless bless you. Look after your self.

1815
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:58,520
Why? But you have a liver, still.

1816
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:01,200
Yogini :Yes. SM: Liver you have still.

1817
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:03,960
Now, what should we do? Did you get some sugar.

1818
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:06,560
Is that's the sugar there? .....

1819
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:09,160
Sugar is yes, sugar is more important now then anything.

1820
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:13,040
Liver is out, you have to work it out.

1821
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:15,320
All right, liver is very....

1822
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:17,760
Yogini : What do I do with it?

1823
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:19,000
Less thinking.

1824
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:23,720
That's my problem, that's my problem.

1825
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:27,160
Come here I will fix it. Now there is only one way.

1826
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:30,880
is to believe in Christ, all right, now lets see, close your eyes.

1827
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:34,240
Just believe in Him, He did exists.

1828
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:37,200
Yogini: I believe, He exist yes. SM : that.

1829
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:38,440
Yogini :You clear them now.SM: All right.

1830
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:40,800
Mother," All right now still there is  an effect here.

1831
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:46,840
I am still have a lot of guilt and negativity.

1832
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:50,040
Unnecessarily why do you have a guilt.

1833
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:51,640
SM: Don't have any guilt.Yogini: I do.

1834
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,680
Yogini,"I do have I don't know why?"

1835
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:57,640
That's goes with the whole catch, conditioning.

1836
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:00,120
Now better.

1837
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:13,240
Is  your hand trembling? Y: Yes. SM: Give a jerk to it.

1838
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:16,360
This will start showing, shake also your hands will shake.

1839
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:20,280
Which ever is the weakness, you see it's come out.

1840
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:22,800
Take out your watch for a while.

1841
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:30,480
Better now, but still there.

1842
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:36,960
Sit comfortable, please comfortable, take time sometime.

1843
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:50,200
Yogini :I think now I had liver problem. SM: you have.

1844
01:59:56,200 --> 02:00:01,760
SM : Eyes are steadied, you have a kataar or something.

1845
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:09,400
SM: Did you bring any oil? Yogini: Yes the little bottle."

1846
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:12,800
Mother, " Put it in the nose and the ears."

1847
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:16,240
Yogini:In the nose. SM: with a dropper.Yogini: Yes.

1848
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:18,680
SM: 'Once in a week.

1849
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:23,200
Mother, "Yes yes you can."

1850
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:32,240
Hamsa is very bad, did you give her camphor?

1851
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:35,120
SM: This lady. Yogi: Yes Mother, shall I give her more.

1852
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:38,320
Did you put some camphor here?Yogini: No.

1853
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:41,400
Better do it, she takes from him that camphor.

1854
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:45,920
will be good, put little bit in the nose, that oil.

1855
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,760
With little in the ears, camphor is good for ears.

1856
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:52,360
Like it camphor, you like the smell.Yes, Mother just like it.

1857
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:54,320
SM: May God bless you. Yogini: Thank you very much.

1858
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:59,400
And avoid fatty foods.

1859
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:02,520
Anything like fried food and ..Yogini: I don't eat.

1860
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:06,920
That's all right, sugar, you must take to sugar, all right.

1861
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:11,440
Three four tea spoon to a cup. Yogini, "really lot of sugar."

1862
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:14,800
Really! whats about dal making?

1863
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:16,960
With my sister, my sister came to you.

Diabetes is too much sugar brings down diabetes. Let her feel

Better come to Me, I must see you.

1866

Diabetes is curable,.... Yogini : Not yet.

1867
02:01:28,120 --> 02:01:30,280
No no, she has to work it out

1868
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:32,240
No no, she has to, diabetes is absolutely

1869
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:36,360
curable  in Sahaja Yoga absolutely, they will tell.

1870

Give her salt, give her the salt that I gave you.

Are you married? Are you married?

1886
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:30,760
What's your age? Thirty two.

1887
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:34,200
You want to marry or what?

1888
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:37,280
You have decided not to marry.

1889
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:39,960
I can't deny. Mother," All right

1890
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:41,560
then say that Mother I will marry.

1891
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:44,160
Mother I will marry sometime.

1892
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:47,000
Good, you have a left Nabhi, that's the problem.

1893
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:50,520
Yogi," Left Nabhi, what is that?" Mother they will tell you.

1894
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,360
All right just ask them.

1895
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:09,000
How are you now better.

1896
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:13,880
You gargle yourself, add more salt, use it for gargle.

1897
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:18,320
This yogi's Vishuddhi, this Chakra is not all right.

1898
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:20,360
You add it to other salt make it

1899
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:25,040
That's sugar,all right. Yogi: that can I add to salt?

1900
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:27,280
Sugar cane it is.

1901
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:43,680
Very small neck, you want to say, I don't know,

1902
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:46,200
they have such a small neck, I don't know.

1903
02:04:58,440 --> 02:05:00,360
It's a complete medicine shop.

1904
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:03,600
All right just to be turn.

1905
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:07,680
Can you pass it?

1906
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:17,760
Hoping the brother must be upset.

1907
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:22,360
How are you? Are you all right, is like this at home also you.

1908
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:24,080
Very much egoistical.

1909
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:26,840
What has she done?

1910
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,160
What has she studied

1911
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:40,600
Catering , catering means what like hostess

1912
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:43,880
Film madam, making film.

1913
02:05:44,440 --> 02:05:47,120
She makes food, God save the...

1914
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:50,840
She is a cook?

1915
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:54,680
Serves? Y: Serves the food.

1916
02:05:56,680 --> 02:05:57,920
If she serves like this.

1917
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:01,800
You can imagine.

1918
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:06,200
You should not have told her about this.

1919
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:08,240
You must see the person, how he is.

1920
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:11,080
Very much egoistical.

1921
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:14,840
Very ego oriented.

1922
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:19,600
And they don't feel it, you see in this country,

1923
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:21,960
you can carry on with this but in India you cannot.

1924
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:24,240
If you are like this they will all through you out.

1925
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:27,440
In the society you can't exist, is a person with a such strong

1926
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:29,680
tongue and all that. You have to be humble.Isn't it?

1927
02:06:30,200 --> 02:06:32,360
You can't tolerate a man who talks like this

1928
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:35,520
or a woman, who talks like this, the humble person.

1929
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:39,600
Did I vibrate this. Y: Yes yes.

1930
02:06:42,280 --> 02:06:43,320
May God bless you.

1931
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:50,920
Now you all look after one person each.You see.

1932
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:53,920
Sought of you just see that which person, I will look after

1933
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:55,920
That person I will look after, till they are established.

1934
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:59,560
And if they are not established then it's your responsibility

1935
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:02,600
He has good ...

1936
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:14,200
Liver is, liver is showing, your liver is all right.

1937
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:16,040
But liver is showing.

1938
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:18,480
Thank God, left is all right.

1939
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:23,360
But liver is showing, that's this, Y: For my eyes.

1940
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:26,760
What about your eyes? Is it low....

1941
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:31,360
Also use a candle.

1942
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:36,000
Ask somebody to give you a bandhan on your back.

1943
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:38,560
Someone on the back Agaya for your eyes

1944
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:42,040
And left Agaya in front, it's a good idea, try that.

1945
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:51,080
ix the salt with more. SM: Yes you can.

1946
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:58,360
For you,  Is it for him?

1947
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:01,280
Y: get for me. SM: For you it's all right, sugar is all right.

1948
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:17,560
You never brought any sugar.

1949
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:21,760
Is there any sugar for him, give him some vibrated sugar.

1950
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:23,960
When he goes for America,  all right.

1951
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:29,600
This is a good one, this is a good idea.

1952
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:32,840
Yes, I mean I can put My fingers in.

1953
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:51,040
Is there somebody, who has to do.

1954
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:58,080
For him, you can tell him the photograph.

1955
02:08:58,680 --> 02:09:00,240
You work out with the photograph?

1956
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:02,280
All of you should on the photograph yourself.

1957
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:04,240
Seven days you are going to carry.

1958
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:07,480
because  for left it will be better off.

1959
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:09,720
You can give the photographs, all of you.

1960
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:11,760
and tell them how to use it.It should work out.

1961
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:14,360
For seven days let them work out with the photograph.

1962
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:20,000
You also take the photograph.

1963
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:39,680
Rosy Kroshan is another....

1964
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,240
All very avidya

1965
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:51,440
They talk on a mental level.

1966
02:09:57,640 --> 02:10:00,520
They teach on a mental level.

1967
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:02,800
Y: Up bring themselves on a spiritual level.

1968
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:04,320
They don't think of that.

1969
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:07,400
They don't think, it's a money making proposition again.

1970
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:09,120
It's in a way.

1971
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:14,680
It is it is, it will end up like that.

1972
02:10:15,320 --> 02:10:16,720
Y: this is it, it's right thing.

1973
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:18,440
SM: That's true but you should see yourself.

1974
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:21,760
You see that  if you somebody talks on a mental level

1975
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:24,600
gives no experience of respect.

1976
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:27,440
you have to be collectively conscious, Christ has said,one thing,

1977
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:30,760
Your hands must speak, just go and ask them, they talk of Christ.

1978
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:34,080
Are your hands speaking, Are their hands speaking.

1979
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:36,800
Christ has said, is it? And he said,

1980
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:38,200
that I will send you a comforter,

1981
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:40,240
who will make you know your father better.

1982
02:10:41,160 --> 02:10:43,520
Not this knowledge, what is the use of knowing everything

1983
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:45,840
about everything but not about your own father.

1984
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:50,120
Not so sure shot to argue with,

1985
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:52,400
And then what about your own powers.

1986
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:54,840
Do they give you any powers? Do you feel anything.

1987
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:57,440
Can you understand anything, can you do anything?

1988
02:10:57,960 --> 02:10:59,120
Can you give realization to any one.Y: I do understand.

1989
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:04,200
No no what do they develop?

1990
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:06,840
You see what I am saying, they don't develop anything.

1991
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:10,120
not a single person, who can say, I can give self realization.

1992
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:13,560
Isn't it, in the rusilation, not a single person.

1993
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:17,440
It's not a single guru, who says I will give you realization.

1994
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:19,800
Not a single guru, that one thing is sure.

1995
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:23,720
They talk of it but they never say we will give you realization.

1996
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:27,560
Beg a pardon.

1997
02:11:31,240 --> 02:11:34,480
He says the guru, the guru will guide you.

1998
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:36,560
That you can find it yourself.

1999
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:38,680
You see, the question is  if

2000
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:41,160
we have to find it ourselves we don't need a guru.Why ?

2001
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:49,440
They are all using your naiveness, you see.

2002
02:11:50,600 --> 02:11:51,680
Because, you don't know

2003
02:11:52,240 --> 02:11:53,840
if you were an Indian you would have known

2004
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:55,880
that you have to have an enlighten soul.

2005
02:11:56,960 --> 02:11:58,560
Who is a guru, to give you realization.

2006
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,880
But you, these people can also say that

2007
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:04,200
Oh see we are, we don't believe in guru,

2008
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:05,600
some say we believe in guru.

2009
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:08,080
Means you believe in the enlighten one.

2010
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:10,040
Who are not not in the point, what is an

2011
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:12,520
The interest of an enlighten one is to see that

2012
02:12:13,120 --> 02:12:14,280
to get your realization.

2013
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:18,200
The guidance they give you is what? Nothing just talking about it.

2014
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:20,800
And talking about, it has been done since ages.

2015
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:23,920
Now your fore fathers and your fathers

2016
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:25,320
Fore father's and their fore fathers and fathers

2017
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:27,960
have talked and talked and talked.

2018
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:30,280
As time for your hand to talk.

2019
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:34,280
All right, this is what, your hands must

2020
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:36,840
Now see you come

2021
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:39,680
To ring, they feel it, so we say yet it's not done.

2022
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:42,880
We don't say you have got it, we don't say that.

2023
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:45,880
We say it's not done. It's not done, it's not done.

2024
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:48,160
When it is done ,it will be done.

2025
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:50,160
You see we cannot see that.

2026
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:52,840
Because you have come here, you will have it.

2027
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:55,280
Isn't it, we can't just say, of course we will work it out.

2028
02:12:56,040 --> 02:12:57,840
We will work it out, you will work it out, lets see.

2029
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:00,800
When it will work out, will work out, all right.

2030
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:04,560
It is like this, it is not that just you become a member something.

2031
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:07,480
or you go to a lecture you become Roosy Croosy

2032
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:09,760
How can you become?

2033
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:16,280
That's, that's what I am telling you.

2034
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:18,400
You must  know that you have not become anything.

2035
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:20,680
You have been just listening to their acrobats.

2036
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:25,000
intellectual acrobat, this is not there.

2037
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:28,040
Y: Vibration to everything.SM:  What you have to have

2038
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:33,120
is to get yourself the power."

2039
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:36,280
Your own power, your spirit must manifest.

2040
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:39,840
Are you manifesting? Not!  SM: Then finished.

2041
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:43,160
That should be their criteria, all right

2042
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:44,800
They may say I am true, I am true

2043
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:46,800
but who gives you the coffee is the one

2044
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:49,080
If they will say, I will give you coffee

2045
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:50,960
He just give you an empty cup.

2046
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:54,840
Then won't you, won't you think that oh God!

2047
02:13:55,400 --> 02:13:56,960
This is an empty cup not a coffee.

2048
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:00,160
So the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it, as they say

2049
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:03,600
What powers did you get?

2050
02:14:04,160 --> 02:14:06,160
You must express your powers.

2051
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:09,160
You must, while all these people are saying, we are manifesting.

2052
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:13,880
None of them would say because they are not.

2053
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:16,800
One gentleman came and told Me, Mother

2054
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:20,760
I am self realised person and I am a twice born.

2055
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:23,400
I said, " All right, just tell Me, where is your Kundalini?"

2056
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:26,760
He said, I don't know, where is the Kundalini of this person.

2057
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:30,160
Where is your blockage, where is the blockage of this person?

2058
02:14:30,680 --> 02:14:33,200
That I don't know, Then you are suppose to be useful for what?

2059
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:36,200
See if I say there is light in this room,

2060
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:38,120
you should be able to see

2061
02:14:43,960 --> 02:14:46,360
Y: Either all this is illusion, SM: all illusion.

2062
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:50,240
They are all illusions, all they, they are very illusive

2063
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:53,040
They live in the illusion, I don't know why?

2064
02:14:53,600 --> 02:14:56,040
And the end of this ....is disastrous

2065
02:14:57,960 --> 02:15:00,040
I don't mind if they carry on with the illusion only,

2066
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:02,920
it is disastrous, see now you have been there

2067
02:15:03,400 --> 02:15:05,760
that's why your avoid caught up.

2068
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:07,960
I mean you would have been realized in no time

2069
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:09,400
because you are a seeker but

2070
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:11,680
because the void is caught you are taking time, isn't it?

2071
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:13,600
So in a way they have harmed you

2072
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:18,080
even if you won't get involved you will get harmed.

2073
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:21,560
This is it, that's why I am very up set them.

2074
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:23,600
They want to make money, they can

2075
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:25,640
They deceive,you see, they can be burglars.

2076
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:27,680
That's easier way to make money.

2077
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:30,600
Not very difficult, why to make all this fuss.

2078
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:37,920
All right, you keep it here, Now. Y: Somebody wants this.

2079
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:41,480
SM; Sugar.Y: There is extra sugar, somebody ?

2080
02:15:49,960 --> 02:15:53,240
Y: Anybody else with. SM: What's your name?

2081
02:15:54,120 --> 02:15:55,160
Y: Anything to vibrate.

2082
02:15:56,840 --> 02:15:59,960
Better now, think before, that you have to decide about marriage.

2083
02:16:00,240 --> 02:16:01,960
Marry now, thirty two, when will you marry?

2084
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:06,480
You have to have some great people being  born.

2085
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:09,720
on this earth, some great saint have to be born.

2086
02:16:10,280 --> 02:16:11,960
Hum, all right.

2087
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:17,480
Yes, good news, Armu's wife is going to have a baby.

2088
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:26,760
How happy they feel you know.

2089
02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:31,160
He is a swiss gentleman......

2090
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:52,640
I think she came to see here if you are brown...

2091
02:16:53,240 --> 02:16:54,280
Y: it's clear not.

2092
02:16:56,720 --> 02:16:57,520
How she came here your sister,

2093
02:16:58,040 --> 02:17:01,240
you see like a great patroange angel.

2094
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:14,640
I don't know if that is so, how can she enjoy.

2095
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:16,280
If she has not touched My spirit.

2096
02:17:17,320 --> 02:17:18,960
See she should be anxious to touch the spirit.

2097
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:21,000
But I think she is not a seeker at all.

2098
02:17:21,560 --> 02:17:25,600
Y: She is. SM: She is, you think so.

2099
02:17:26,640 --> 02:17:27,760
Try to bring her now.

2100
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:32,960
Put her left to the right.

2101
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:38,560
I wish you luck.

2102
02:17:41,640 --> 02:17:43,600
She should, I mean she should really come and enjoy but

2103
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:45,480
But there is no, she was in a very arrogant mood,

2104
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:47,720
she came here and I can see her.

2105
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:54,800
So it's over, can I make a move.

2106
02:17:57,680 --> 02:18:00,400
Still little more  more.

2107
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:04,760
What you do you get vibrated for everyone in a big way.

2108
02:18:05,320 --> 02:18:07,280
and give it to them if they need it.You see, I will be moving now.

2109
02:18:07,880 --> 02:18:08,720
Out of London.

2110
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:18,160
How are you now.

2111
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:22,760
Looking very much better.

2112
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:26,520
Very much better, that anemic look has gone now.

2113
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:28,680
You don't look anemic any more.

2114
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:32,920
You have left Nabhi.You have  left Nabhi problem.

2115
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:37,400
Also left Nabhi ....

2116
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:41,680
It's all.

2117
02:18:52,680 --> 02:18:54,320
I don't feel guilty at all, do you?

2118
02:19:01,400 --> 02:19:04,880
For what? if you had  done anything that great.

2119
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:07,680
Leave off, you could never have got realization.

2120
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:09,320
So why to feel guilty?

2121
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:12,480
Just come here, come!

2122
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:50,560
Better now?

2123
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:56,120
Yes, better?

2124
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:04,520
Happening, Much better.

2125
02:20:10,120 --> 02:20:12,600
How are you? All right.

2126
02:20:15,360 --> 02:20:16,760
These are the best lemons.

2127
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:18,920
You see, they suck your vibrations very fast.

2128
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
These are little high breed the other one are.

2129
02:20:22,360 --> 02:20:24,920
These are normal, these are normal, I think.

2130
02:20:25,360 --> 02:20:26,880
They are very good.

2131
02:20:33,320 --> 02:20:36,160
I am sorry I have leave early because it's already quite late.

2132
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:38,360
They must be waiting

2133
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:46,240
Sunday morning, no

02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:49,080

2135
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:52,240
Saturday morning I would like to go and buy some flowers for them.

2136
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:57,600
Or if somebody could go to the flower shop.

2137
02:20:58,200 --> 02:20:59,520
You can take our three four boxes

2138
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:00,960
with  us in the plane.

2139
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:05,360
That would be in the morning.

02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:19,200
It's from both the Ashrams, we have got this.

2185
02:25:21,880 --> 02:25:23,800
Now for our traveling as you know.

2186

02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:35,800
There was four hundred nineteen ideen... cash now,

2189
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:39,200
There is Cheque of five  hundred and eight.

2190
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:48,440
He told Me there is thousand five hundred.

2191
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:51,600
Y: Yes Mother all together, all together.

2192
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,320
Y: There is about four hundred.

2193
02:25:57,600 --> 02:25:58,960
It is Kumkum will be vibrated.

2194
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:03,560
Just but they do it, you see, Indians are very plastic minded.

2195
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:07,560
Horrible, It's beyond Me.

2196
02:26:28,160 --> 02:26:29,640
I wouldn't brought a pen or anything.

2197
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:35,560
All five minutes in the room, what had happened, How are you?

2198
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:39,400
SM: Better now.Y: Yes Mam.

2199
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:46,160
Put it in a proper thing you know.

2200
02:26:54,560 --> 02:26:55,840
From plastic to plastic.

2201
02:27:06,480 --> 02:27:09,600
But dust can disappear into dust but plastic cannot.

2202
02:27:19,160 --> 02:27:22,040
I don't understand why should they put Kumkum in a plastic thing.

2203
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:24,120
It is just can't understand, stupid people

2204
02:27:25,360 --> 02:27:27,920
Hum hum, very good peas.

2205
02:27:28,520 --> 02:27:30,440
Who's done, you bought this

2206
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:34,880
Yogini, It was here in the Ashram, I don't know who got that.

2207
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:38,760
Is it, done beautifully.

2208
02:27:40,640 --> 02:27:42,760
Nice thing they do, it's very nice.

2209
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:46,480
Its for pouring water or what?

2210
02:27:49,440 --> 02:27:50,280
Y: Ya. SM: Is it?

2211
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:56,120
It was in the Ashram

2212
02:28:01,960 --> 02:28:03,400
How are you, good, I am very happy.

2213
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:06,240
She is doing well, she is doing very well.

2214
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:10,400
Yogini: Mother I want one suggestion from you.

2215
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:16,720
I  have been actually, this was guru, who gave the mantra.

2216
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:19,960
So I want to just to say that, how what should I

2217
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:22,880
I don't actually chant the mantra now.

2218
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:25,640
Since I have SM: You don't.

2219
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:28,680
Now but... Mother: What is his name?

2220
02:28:29,320 --> 02:28:33,200
Hari, Hari, Shri Hari Maharaj.

2221
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,560
Where does he live? Yogini: Jalandher.

2222
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:41,720
Does he take any money? Yogini: No, nothing.

2223
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:44,720
Yogini: No, it is not an institute, I mean it's just a...

2224
02:28:45,320 --> 02:28:46,320
He lives in someone's house

2225
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:50,040
and everybody goes there and do meditation.

2226
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:54,600
It is coming but don't understand how come he gave you mantra.

2227
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:58,280
He shouldn't give you  mantra.Yogini: This is what he...

2228
02:28:59,160 --> 02:29:02,520
Satnam, satnam, He only chants this day and night.

2229
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:04,960
He looks realized.

2230
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:08,600
SM: He seems to be realized. Yogini: Is he a great one?

2231
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:11,680
SM: He doesn't seem to be a great one but he is a realized soul.

2232
02:29:12,480 --> 02:29:14,960
Yogini: OK, then me and my husband

2233
02:29:15,640 --> 02:29:17,840
chant their mantra.

2234
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:21,480
Mantra is not right thing.OK, show him My photo.

2235
02:29:21,960 --> 02:29:24,360
He will understand, he is realized.

2236
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:29,600
Just realized guru.

2237
02:29:30,160 --> 02:29:32,280
At last, at long last.

2238
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:35,840
But he has no institution, takes no money.

2239
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:37,960
Fine, you see he doesn't take any money institutionally

2240
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:39,280
He lives in somebody's house.

2241
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:40,920
Very simple man, that's what she is saying

2242
02:29:41,440 --> 02:29:43,320
but mantra he cannot should  not give,

2243
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:45,320
Though whatever mantra he has given you

2244
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:47,760
is awaken mantra, no doubt because he is realized soul.

2245
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:50,840
He should not, because you stuck up with that.

2246
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:52,760
You see these realized soul also don't

2247
02:29:53,440 --> 02:29:54,400
that you people are not even realized.

2248
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:56,960
Then they give you mantra.That's the problem.

2249
02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:03,480
So I haven't since stop saying mantra. SM: You just

2250
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:05,880
SM: You don't need, now you become the guru,

2251
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:10,400
Isn't it, now you become the guru."

2252
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:12,320
You will know the mantras now.

2253
02:30:12,840 --> 02:30:14,320
now you will know what mantra's to be done, for whom?

2254
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:16,960
Why should you take any mantra from anyone anymore?

2255
02:30:18,040 --> 02:30:19,560
SM: To a unrealized soul you should, never give a manta

2256
02:30:20,280 --> 02:30:22,080
to begin with and one mantra is not going to work it out.

2257
02:30:22,600 --> 02:30:24,520
And now a days the Kundalini doesn't move.

2258
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:27,600
Satnam is only for Vishuddhi.

2259
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:32,040
What about, other Chakras.Yogini: It means Satnam can be recited

2260
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:35,080
. SM: Yes, You can say Twemev Sakshaat Satnam...

2261
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:38,240
if you say it is all right, that's a truthful name.

2262
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:41,360
You can say but that will open your Vishuddhi.

2263
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:45,440
Hum.. better vibrations.

2264
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:52,360
That's Satnam means true names

2265
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:55,840
SM: Yes. Y: Every where Satnam.

2266
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:19,040
Somebody will pick Me up on saturday.

2267
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:25,200
I mean, somebody has to just come, we have a car.

2268
02:31:26,360 --> 02:31:28,160
But only problem is that somebody has to come.

2269
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:37,720
Buy flower, saturday is it open, the flower shop.

2270
02:31:39,640 --> 02:31:40,800
The big play.

2271
02:31:45,880 --> 02:31:50,080
You can go and buy, then pay you.
