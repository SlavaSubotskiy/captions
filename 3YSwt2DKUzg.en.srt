1
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:20,219
Today is the day we are celebrating Easter.
Easter is extremely symbolic, of - not only

2
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:35,309
of Christ, but also for all of us. In that
the most important day is that of resurrection.

3
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:56,659
The resurrection of Christ has 
the message of Christianity, not the cross.
Through resurrection Christ had shown that

4
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:21,810
one can be resurrected with the body that
you have. And without His resurrection, we

5
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:36,440
could not have managed the crossing of Agnya
chakra, no doubt. His life was very short

6
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:54,940
of, we can say three and half years only,
He lived there. He came to India and He met

7
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:06,540
Shalivahana, and Shalivahana asked His name.
He told him His name was Isa Masih.

8
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,799
But He said, "I am coming from the country
where there are malichchas, mala-ichchha.

9
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:23,010
They have ichchha of mal, desire to get dirty,
and I don't know how to live there. To Me,

10
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:29,819
this is My country."

11
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:36,819
But Shalivahana said that, "You should go
back and save Your people and give them Parama

12
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:47,150
Nirmala Tattwam. So He went back, and as it
is, within three and half years He was crucified.

13
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:57,980
At the time of His death He said so many beautiful
things for forgiveness, but ultimately He

14
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,959
said "Behold the Mother." That means you should
hope for the Mother. And in His lifetime He

15
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,640
also said that, "I'll send you the Holy Ghost
Who will comfort you, counsel you and also

16
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:32,810
redeem", means resurrect you. All these things
He had said it because He knew what was the

17
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:38,610
whole plan.

18
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:45,610
Also He said that, "You may say anything against
Me or do anything against Me, but anything

19
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,180
against the Holy Ghost I will not tolerate.
I will not tolerate at any cost."

20
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:07,370
Which is true also, so it is very dangerous
also to go against the Holy Ghost. No doubt

21
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:17,580
about it. It's not Me that is dangerous, but
these Deities are extremely dangerous.

22
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:26,669
So, in Sahaja Yoga you are all resurrected
with your body. Before this you were not connected

23
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:40,970
to the All Pervading Power, and whatever you
did was through your mind or through your

24
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:49,940
emotions. But you did not come out of that
grave of emotions and your desires, your actions

25
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:07,910
and your ego. After realization now you know
how free you have become. How you have developed

26
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:26,530
your own personality.

27
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:33,530
There are so many instances which we can talk
about Christ, that He said, "Know Thyself"

28
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:45,449
throughout. He knew without knowing yourself,
you won't be resurrected. But Sahaja Yoga

29
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:52,580
is the other way round. You get your resurrection
and you know yourself. It's a very Sahaja,

30
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,740
sweet way of getting realization.

31
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:09,740
But if you see to the life of Christ, He has
talked about murmuring souls. We too have

32
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,320
in Sahaja Yoga, because it's open to everyone,
all kinds of people come. We find very shallow

33
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:26,320
people coming to Sahaja Yoga who try to express
their shallowness and talk in a very, in a

34
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:37,130
very 
loose way, about Sahaja Yoga, about the work
of Sahaja Yoga. So that was inevitable, but

35
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:53,580
what Christ has said that you have to be careful
about the murmuring souls. And this is exactly

36
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:03,540
- we have to be very careful. When you come
to Sahaja Yoga, in the beginning, you may

37
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
come across such people who are murmuring
souls, you may be enticed by them because

38
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:20,479
they are a kind of, we should say, messengers
of negative forces. And these messengers of

39
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:30,500
negative forces, you should try to find out.
They'll complain about this, complain about

40
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:37,500
that, they talk in a very loose manner, and
when you see that they are not talking in

41
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:50,210
a positive way, you should run away from them.
Because only by getting your resurrection

42
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:57,860
you are not all right. After getting your
resurrection, after your Self-realization,

43
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:06,419
you have to grow. And for that growth we have
to be very careful about how we get impressed

44
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:14,780
by all these, I should say, very frivolous
people. Those who grow into it become beautiful

45
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:27,430
angels. No doubt about that. But that is one
thing one has to know is to respect your Self-realization.

46
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,699
You shouldn't worry about what others are
talking, what others are saying, what they

47
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:41,699
are criticizing, but you should look at yourself
and all the time try to grow into your depth.

48
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:48,369
It's a very great chance of life that you
are being resurrected, and this is the last

49
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:54,569
breakthrough, as you know, of our evolution.
But now you should leave your mind on one

50
00:08:54,569 --> 00:09:01,569
side; because this mind, if you go on working
with it, you cannot go beyond mind and Sahaja

51
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:08,850
Yoga you can achieve by going beyond your
mind. Then you know yourself, because you

52
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:18,610
get Self-knowledge. You know about your centers.
You know about the centers of others. All

53
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:25,610
this is available to you, but you have to
become a subtler and subtler person. Not a

54
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:33,899
gross personality. If you become subtler and
subtler, you will be amazed how you will develop

55
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:42,869
your inner powers in so many different ways.

56
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:49,290
But there are people in Sahaja Yoga, I have
seen, who are very ambitious. And they start

57
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:56,290
saying that, "Mother, we want to be God realized.
I want to be this and do that." There is no

58
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:06,610
office going on here that you give somebody
a promotion. You have to grow yourself. Then

59
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:14,110
they start proclaiming, "I am this, I am that."
We call them 'Mahayogis'. Some of them had

60
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:21,350
started saying that they have reached very
high positions and they ended up in the lunatic

61
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:29,399
asylum. All such suggestions if people give
you, then you should shun such people. But

62
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:39,089
there are also other people who join such
a bombastic fellow. So, you must remember

63
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:47,899
that this last judgment is working and all
the time there is a big sieving out, a very

64
00:10:54,939 --> 00:11:01,939
big arrangement of choices. Those who are
subtle, start getting subtler and subtler

65
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:11,220
and subtler. But those who are frivolous,
gross, idiotic, stupid, they start frittering

66
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:19,920
away. So this last sieving starts very fast,
working out where we realize that where are

67
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:25,290
we.

68
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:32,290
Now what is the criteria for that? First is
your compassion. Your compassion must be discrete.

69
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:50,869
Sometimes people only have compassion for
negative people. After Sahaja Yoga you should

70
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:57,869
know for whom you should have your compassion.
With vibrations you can find out, very easy

71
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:09,059
to find out with vibrations - what sort of
a person you are facing. But first you must

72
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:15,410
have vibratory awareness. If you don't have
vibratory awareness, you won't be able to

73
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:22,410
find out at all what is correct and what is
incorrect. So it is important that you all

74
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:37,100
must mediate. Without criticizing yourself,
anything, you can just meditate everyday.

75
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:43,199
Is very important!
I immediately know who is the person who is

76
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:50,199
meditating and who is not meditating. Immediately!
The person who meditates is very clearly an

77
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:03,879
angel. The whole reaction, the whole behavior,
the whole attitude of such spiritual maturity

78
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:16,939
manifests. And you are amazed. As you know
Sahasrare Mahamaya. It's not easy to understand

79
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:29,369
Me. For the time being you might know what
I am, but suddenly you will forget. That's

80
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:40,220
the trick. Because if you know Me in full
ways, you won't even sit here. You won't even

81
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:47,369
come nearer to Me. So that Mahamaya is acting
all the time, but that's the only way you

82
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,609
can judge people.

83
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:58,489
This last judgment is not a easy thing. Even
if you put thousands of judges, they cannot

84
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:05,489
do this judgment. All the time you have to
know what is what. And somehow I know everything,

85
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:17,919
but I will never show that I know. That's
how I work it out, and gradually I know what

86
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,169
I have to do about that person.

87
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:31,169
This resurrection of yours is much more blessed
than that of Christ. He was alone; people

88
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:42,329
wouldn't recognize Him. He had to show His
marks where they had put nails on His hands

89
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:50,839
and feet. But today that is not the situation.
Only thing is, first of all you have to recognize

90
00:14:54,569 --> 00:15:01,569
Me. That's all. Need not know Me. It's not
easy. It's difficult to know Me, but if you

91
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:09,109
recognize Me, that's all. And it all depends
on your sensitivity. Your resurrection has

92
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:18,269
to be complete and you have to mature in Sahaja
Yoga. If you cannot mature, I will say you

93
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:28,449
should leave Sahaja Yoga. Go out for a while,
where you will understand what's going on,

94
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:32,579
then you'll come back.

95
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:39,579
In Sahaja Yoga, like Christ sacrificed His
life, is not expected of you to sacrifice

96
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:51,829
your life. Your Mother doesn't want that.
But you have to do some sacrifices, like you

97
00:15:53,749 --> 00:16:00,749
have to stay in uncomfortable places in Ganapatipule
sometimes, or somewhere. You have to face

98
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:09,859
many odds while traveling, also coming down
here may not be so comfortable as you are

99
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:20,879
at your place. But the main sacrifice is of
your ego. You have to crucify your ego. The

100
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:30,809
ego is the one, which teaches you all these
nonsensical tantrums that people know. If

101
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:41,109
you can surrender your ego - just surrender
your ego - that surrendering can help you.

102
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:52,819
But if you surrender your ego by thinking
about it, then you are using your mental capacity.

103
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:02,489
Everything you do like that is through your
mental capacity, by which you are using your

104
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:09,489
ego. So the best way is to meditate, to go
into thoughtless awareness and there automatically

105
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:14,870
you are surrendered.

106
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:20,589
Now what do I have to have from you? Nothing!
I don't want anything. I don't want to have

107
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:26,120
anything. You are the ones who try to give
Me this and give Me that. I am trying to run

108
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:33,120
away from all that. Just for your satisfaction
also, I agree. I don't have to do Sahaja Yoga

109
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Myself, but that's the love of your Mother.
That She wants to save as many as possible

110
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:52,950
- all that are created on this Earth - to
give them their resurrection. This is a special

111
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:01,610
time and you are My channels. You can go all
over and spread Sahaja Yoga and try to help

112
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:06,169
others to come out of it.

113
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:13,169
Today is a day of promises, where we have
to promise ourselves that we'll grow in a

114
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:21,669
very deeper understanding, or feeling, or
in sensitiveness of Sahaja Yoga. This growth

115
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:34,600
has to take place for which I have to meditate.
This is a very important thing.

116
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:43,700
Secondly, people say that here people are
very miserly. They are not willing to do this.

117
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,559
They don't want to pay any money for this,
pay any money for that. I think generosity

118
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:59,559
is one expression of your love. You will give
Me, all right. When it comes to expenses,

119
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:07,320
either I pay or somebody bears the burden.
Now things have improved, but still we should

120
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,840
know that this tremendous work has to be done
and we need money for that. I don't need,

121
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:23,070
I spend My own money. But generosity is the
best and this generosity is very, very important

122
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,490
for Sahaja Yogis.

123
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:36,490
I have seen people are very meticulous sometimes,
very calculating. They will tell Me, "Bring

124
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,559
some sarees for them." Take some sarees, all
right, very good idea. And they say, "We don't

125
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:49,559
like it, we don't want to buy." I am not doing
any business. I buy it because you wanted,

126
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,750
I have selected it. Then to say, "we don't
want to have it." There's no business, there's

127
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:02,750
no marketing going on. And this is the problem
when I don't understand Sahaja Yogis that

128
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:09,289
they should know Mother, Herself, has put
in Her money. So what is there also, they

129
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:16,289
should say, "take little more for Sahaja Yoga."
After all such a big organization going on,

130
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:24,620
and there are so many countries who cannot
pay a single farthing, for them also one has

131
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,740
to pay.

132
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:32,740
Now, Christ was sold for thirty rubles. You
can imagine, He was sold for thirty rubles.

133
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:42,029
So that shows that when you do not try to
understand the financial difficulties of the

134
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:51,090
organizers and you do not help, you are really
selling the Christ within you. You cannot

135
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:02,480
sell Christ, you cannot sell Sahaja Yoga.
But that doesn't mean you exploit it. So I

136
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:10,250
have to tell you that I was Myself surprised
in north India where I least expected people

137
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:17,250
are extremely generous, extremely generous.
And then generosity helps you, in a way that

138
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:27,029
our Lakshmi Tatwa is to be awakened.

139
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:33,620
I had to bring in this point because I have
complaints from people that people are reluctant

140
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:40,620
to pay for anything like this. It's very remarkable
that some people take over, but everybody

141
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:53,389
must contribute. It's important, because you
are doing God's work. You have to also come

142
00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:59,809
forward to do other things that are there
without grudging. Enjoying it! I was happy

143
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:06,769
the posters were put by the Sahaja Yogis,
and you can see the whole place vibrated.

144
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:13,769
You could see how it has worked out. So everybody
must go all out to do everything that is possible.

00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:25,389
Nothing else is needed but your full heart
into Sahaja Yoga. Then you will see how you

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:33,679
will grow. It is only through your heart you
will receive all your nourishment for your
