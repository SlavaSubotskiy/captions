00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:07,238
06.10.1983 Shri Ganesha Puja
Vancouver (Canada)

2
00:00:15,693 --> 00:00:18,599
Now raise your Kundalini.

3
00:00:19,028 --> 00:00:22,030
All of you raise your Kundalini and tie it up so that

4
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:24,824
 it's up there.  Just raise it like that.

5
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:31,281
No. This way. This way you should do it. This way.

6
00:01:07,705 --> 00:01:11,565
In the West, you have grown very big outside,

7
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:14,025
like a tree has grown very big.

8
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:18,681
But it must find its roots, otherwise the whole tree can fall off,

9
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:23,615
without nutrition. So you must know the knowledge of the roots.

10
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:27,270
Without the knowledge of the roots, the tree has no meaning.

11
00:01:28,952 --> 00:01:33,275
 So this may be a little new thing for you to understand,

12
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:35,978
but you must know ... to know the knowledge of the roots

13
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:37,859
 you have to become subtle.

14
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:41,769
If you are not a subtle personality you cannot enter into your roots

15
00:01:42,064 --> 00:01:46,039
and you cannot understand what lies in there.

16
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:49,064
So, first of all, I said yesterday,

17
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:53,278
you all should get your Realisation, and after your Realisation

18
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,690
 you can understand this better than anything else.

19
00:01:58,214 --> 00:01:59,955
Christ came on this earth,

20
00:02:00,392 --> 00:02:03,371
 but he was only allowed to preach and talk

21
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:06,112
 for three and a half years of his life time.

22
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:08,294
And in tree and a half years is nothing.

23
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,513
In that, whatever was possible he said positively,

24
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:15,923
 he told about the future,  all that was to happen.

25
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,768
 He didn't talk much about the Holy Ghost.

26
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:22,858
The reason was His Mother was the Holy Ghost at that time

27
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:25,100
 and He didn't want to talk about Her

28
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:27,930
because the attention of the people

29
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:30,890
would be on Her and they would have killed Her.

30
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:35,463
And then he has got eleven destroying powers.

31
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:39,258
 And he would have used those eleven destroying powers

32
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:42,311
and everything would have been finished,

33
00:02:42,446 --> 00:02:44,525
 the whole drama would have been finished.

34
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:48,513
So He did not mention much about the Holy Ghost and did not exaplain.

35
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:53,224
But logically we must understand that we talk of the Father

36
00:02:53,495 --> 00:02:56,475
 and of the Son but not of the Mother.

37
00:02:56,602 --> 00:03:00,002
How can you have a father and a son and no mother?

38
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:04,442
 That's an impossibility. So, Holy Ghost is the Primordial Mother.

39
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:06,852
In the sanskrit language if you go -

40
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:10,093
 because in the Bible you cannot find everything about Christ,

41
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:11,603
 it's very little.

42
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:15,603
But you have to go back about 1400 years back that in India,

43
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:19,601
people have prophesied about Him, how He will be coming.

44
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:21,885
 And about the Primordial Mother

45
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:25,067
who was called as Adi Shakti  who was the Holy Ghost.

46
00:03:25,357 --> 00:03:28,615
All description was given  and when Her advent will come

47
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,224
 what will happen and how to recognize her.

48
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:35,850
All this is described very well so many years back,

49
00:03:35,977 --> 00:03:38,911
even about Christ, quite a lot to described

50
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,960
 and also we are going to read it out to you,

51
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:44,960
 the translation of what is written about Christ

52
00:03:45,222 --> 00:03:50,745
and then there is a complete description about His origin,

53
00:03:50,907 --> 00:03:54,295
 how He came on this earth and what was the purpose of His life.

54
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,657
Ask that gentlemen to come inside. Can you ?

55
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,428
This gentlemen, come inside. You sit comfortably.

56
00:04:02,282 --> 00:04:04,413
And what was the purpose of His life

57
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:08,143
and how He has to establish in this centre here

58
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:12,094
and that by establishing there he can suck

59
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:16,821
the ego and superego in you and how He takes you away,

60
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:21,197
 or He washes off your karmas and your conditionings.

61
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:25,409
All that has been described very well in the Devi Mahatmya book

62
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:28,480
 out of which we are just going to read a little bit to you

63
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,961
about the adoration.

64
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:33,625
So Bible cannot contain Christ, because Christ is Chaitanya,

65
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:37,136
 He is Omkara, He is the Logos as we call Him.

66
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:41,514
 He is the Power, and you cannot describe Him in one little book,

67
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:44,895
when He was here only for three and a half years  and

68
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:48,197
the people who saw him also were his disciples,

69
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:50,821
they did not know much about Him.

70
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:53,314
 Until he was resurrected they did not believe Him

71
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:56,927
 and even after His death, I mean His resurrection,

72
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,965
Matthew and all these people were quite disturbed and upset

73
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,165
 because you know they were all persecuted

74
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:06,033
and they, somehow or the other, wanted to continue

75
00:05:06,394 --> 00:05:09,504
 the message of Christ in a very secretive manner.

76
00:05:10,713 --> 00:05:13,820
So today the time has come for you to know about Him,

77
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:17,815
about what He was -  in the Heaven

78
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:19,881
 and how He came on this Earth.

79
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:24,224
 All that we don't have time today but we'll be just telling you

80
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:27,738
 about a little passage that is written about him.

81
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:30,885
So first, He is the one who is innocence,

82
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,909
 who is an eternal child,

83
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:37,714
and He appears first on the first chakra of Muladhara,

84
00:05:37,897 --> 00:05:39,957
 and there He's called as Shri Ganesh.

85
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:42,604
Where the carbon atom was made. Carbon.

86
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:46,223
And that is very important to understand that Ganesha

87
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:49,456
 is the symbol of innocence

88
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:56,697
and Mother Earth is the power of that deity, Ganesha.

89
00:05:57,062 --> 00:06:01,767
So it was Ganesha, later on incarnated on this Earth  as Christ,

90
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:06,301
 and He will be incarnated again as eleven Rudras,

91
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:10,028
 means Ekadashas, or we can call him as Nishkalanka deity,

92
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:13,683
when He will just sort out things in a sense that

93
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:18,029
He will just cut the people out who are not realised,

94
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:21,772
 who are no good, and the rest of them

95
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,363
will ascend in the Kingdom of Heaven,

96
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:26,360
 this is what is the last Ascent.

97
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:29,074
Now, for this ... Please sit down, please.

98
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:31,404
 Please be seated, give him a chair ...

99
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:33,561
 You have to sit down comfortably. You see,

100
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:36,876
It is a thing that makes... happen something within you,

101
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:39,831
so you have to be very much restful, that's very important.

102
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:43,396
Give him a chair if he cannot sit on the ground.

103
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:47,851
Give him a chair, but be comfortable otherwise it won't work out, you see,

104
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:50,643
 it is not something that will go into your mind,

105
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:52,842
 it's something that will go to your being, so

106
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:54,377
you have to be very receptive.

107
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:56,618
Another thing I'll tell you, yesterday also

108
00:06:56,713 --> 00:07:00,614
I saw, and today also, you should not move your neck

109
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:03,077
by eating something or chewing something

110
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,881
because this Vishuddhi chakra gets upset at that time.

111
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:08,595
So keep still, unless and until you are still

112
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,062
 it cannot work out. So please keep still.

113
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,240
So this is the nourishment of the roots

114
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,171
of which we are going to work out, which you will feel it,

115
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:21,441
very nicely within yourself.
