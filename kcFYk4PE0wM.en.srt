00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:22,700
Today is the day of worshipping your guru:

2
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,180
that is your Mother.

3
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,360
And as I told you, it’s a very unique happening

4
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,800
that Mother, Herself, has to become your Guru.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,100
And also you know that it is a very difficult task for a Mother to be a guru,

6
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:49,660
Because her love is so overflowing

7
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:56,820
that it is difficult for Her to give any discipline to Her children.

8
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,620
She can not discipline Her own Love.

9
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,440
How can She discipline Her children?

10
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:11,300
Being that, the responsibility on the disciples is much more.

11
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:20,100
If the Guru is the person who can discipline you

12
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,820
without feeling anything

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,280
hurting to him,

14
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,640
he is much more capable, and he can do it.

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:46,820
But for a Mother it is a very, very, very difficult,

16
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:59,480
I would say, a very difficult job to be the guru.

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,960
She does not know how to balance,

18
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,840
And She is extremely forgiving because She is the Mother.

19
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,660
While the guru, from the very beginning, does not forgive.

20
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,600
But mother, till the end, she’ll go to the last end.

21
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,840
Even if the child has forsaken her,

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
even if he has beaten her up,

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,360
even if he is willing to kill Her,

24
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,460
still She will be saying that, "My child are you hurt?"

25
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,880
Then the responsibility of the disciples is much more, to see

26
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,520
that they do not hurt Her,

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,300
and they do not hurt Her, and they do not take My love for granted.

28
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,560
For they must know that they have to prove themselves

29
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,460
and they have to improve themselves.

30
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,340
That is why this day it is a very unique combination

31
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,720
of tremendous Love

32
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,380
overflowing you,

33
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,220
and also the thought,

34
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,260
I would say, the divine inspiration,

35
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,940
that tells me that you have to be disciplined.

36
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,880
You have to be disciplined sahaja,

37
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,500
not by another person.

38
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,720
But has to be,

39
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:33,060
because if the ship is not properly tied up

40
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,080
and it is not seaworthy

41
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,520
it cannot go very far.

42
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,780
If you want to enjoy

43
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:54,660
the ride in the ocean of His grace and compassion,

44
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,900
His bliss and kindness,

45
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,080
then you must build up yourself fully.

46
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,100
Now we have seen we have chakras,

47
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:15,840
and we can excite them, we can awaken them by awakening the Deities.

48
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,520
But is it not a mechanical process.

49
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,020
Every Deity has got a subtle point behind it,

50
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:28,080
which is a very subtle being within you.

51
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,900
You know them, one by one.

52
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:40,360
And you know why these chakras are catching — because you lack that part.

53
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,860
There is nothing to feel bad about it.

54
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,260
As I told you this is like your motor car outside.

55
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:52,420
This is your instrument. But the instrument has to be properly harmonised and cleaned.

56
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,880
Today I want certain promises by you to be reached.

57
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,640
And the foremost of all,

58
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,620
as Christ has said,

59
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,320
"Love thy neighbour as thyself".

60
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,480
I would say, one step ahead of that:

61
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:17,400
"Love thy neighbour, a sahaja yogi, more that yourself."

62
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:29,580
Let us start here. I don’t ask you to do for the whole universe: among yourselves.

63
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,560
First of all decide: what have you done for others?

64
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:42,260
Second: A promise you have to make that you will never say a harsh word to any other sahaj yogi,

65
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,180
even if he beats you hollow!

66
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,500
You can tell for that:

67
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,640
that is the greatest sin you will be committing from sins.

68
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,280
Don't try to correct others!

69
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,260
If he asks you to check things then tell that sweetly.

70
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,800
But do not be harsh! Use your tongue for saying something sweet.

71
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,160
I am telling you again and again and again.

72
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,480
Otherwise I will put some sort of a restriction on you.

73
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,200
Try to control your tongue.

74
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,500
It’s very essential to put sweetly something, you can,

75
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
you are sahaja yogis,

76
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,920
it’s very easy to put it sweetly [something].

77
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,440
It’s such an attractive thing.

78
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,980
Why do you say harsh things?

79
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,380
For what? To create enemy?

80
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,880
If you want to have enemies, you can have so many:

81
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,020
for that you need not say harsh things.

82
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,700
Very easy to gather enemies. It is difficult to get friends.

83
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,900
And difficult to get your own kith and kin.

84
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,220
The Sahaj Yogis, you have one Mother.

85
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,080
And that hurts Me the most.

86
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,400
Any, any, thing that tries to break you

87
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,880
will take out my heart into many parts.

88
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,960
And this body, it becomes divided into many parts.

89
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
So don't do that to Me.

90
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,160
This is the greatest suffering I can have from you.

91
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,520
I request you not to do that because I have taken you into My Being,

92
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
and you are part and parcel of Me.

93
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,060
You are one of the thousand petals of My Sahasrar,

94
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,600
and I don’t want these petals to be broken by you

95
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,680
and to be trampled by others.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You have your own dignity, and respect the dignity of others.

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,080
And you are Sahaj yogis, realised-souls,

98
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,880
you must know.

99
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,040
You are not ordinary people.

100
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,460
As you respect yourself, you’ll respect others.

101
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,620
This is one thing I have to tell you:

102
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,740
that among yourselves you should be very humble

103
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,080
and very friendly and extremely sweet.

104
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,600
Also when you will start doing that gradually you will learn a method

105
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,740
by which you’ll be very sweet.

106
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,580
It is better to be sweet than to be harsh.

107
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,000
It is better to be beaten up than to be beating others.

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,300
It is better to be simple and deceived than to be deceiving others.

109
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,740
We are like the shield and the shield has to fight the sword.

110
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:45,120
Sword doesn’t fight a sword, the shield does.

111
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,340
This is, you must understand, that for anything

112
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,740
no harsh words needs to be said. Keep quiet.

113
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,600
Just try to control your tongue.

114
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,800
That is one thing:

115
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,120
that there should not be disunity because you are collectively conscious among yourselves.

116
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,140
If there is disunity among you,

117
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,980
you cannot be one: then how can we think of the whole world being one? Just think of it!

118
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:28,160
And your responsibility is much greater because you are the first people who have got it in the whole of Europe and the whole of England.

119
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,640
Respect each other.

120
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,040
Think of the good points everyone has.

121
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,380
Try to love.

122
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,700
If I were like you:

123
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,740
you know I am complete I have no problem -

124
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,540
why am I bothering?

125
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,040
Because I love you.

126
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,340
If you love each other you will see the good points of another,

127
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,160
and you will imbibe them.

128
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,460
Try to love each other

129
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,960
But do not confuse this love with a carnal love.

130
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,800
his is Divine love:

131
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:21,260
absolutely pure, elevating, helping you to ascend.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,420
Tonight you promise Me that

133
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,780
you will look at every sahaja yogi

134
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,420
as a person in bondage in love

135
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,960
and not in hatred.

136
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,700
And if somebody you think is not doing right or going bad,

137
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,520
then you cure that person sitting in the house.

138
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,500
You know how to cure.

139
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:53,120
But do not be harsh. By talking ill you are not going to do anything to him.

140
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,020
You use your methods which you know very well.

141
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:02,100
This is one point. And that will give Me the greatest pleasure, the greatest of all:

142
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,860
when I will see all my children loving each other,

143
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,860
being kind to each other,

144
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,740
running to do for others, trying to help each other

145
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,240
and extremely humbled down.

146
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,080
Some of you are better off, some of you are more intelligent,

147
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,280
some of you have got more heart qualities.

148
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,840
Do not try to show down somebody who lacks little bit in intelligence,

149
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:28,860
or somebody who has little less of love
Do not try to show down somebody who lacks little bit in intelligence

150
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,400
or somebody who has little less of love.

151
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,840
May be that person just he wants more love.

152
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,500
But try to give than to expect others to give.

153
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,520
Then the second one: I want you, all of you,

154
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,660
today, to know that you are the people

155
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,200
who have to build up sahaja yoga in your country

156
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,600
and also in other countries wherever you go.

157
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
So you have to give it like seeds

158
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,180
and the seeds which has to grow the Whole Tree!

159
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,200
You have to bear all other trees - so how important you are!

160
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
So today you have to resolve

161
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,060
that in your personal life you are going to be honest.

162
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,040
You are going to watch yourself, you are going to introspect yourself,

163
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
you are not going to tell lies.

164
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,020
And you are going to look after your chastity, look after your life

165
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,760
as a very precious thing!

166
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,220
And you are not going to cheat yourself.

167
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,500
And you are not going to debase yourself.

168
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,840
And you are not going to denigrate yourself,

169
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,240
in your own eyes!

170
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,500
But develop those eyes which criticise all these things and can see Yourself.

171
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:45,260
Today you must promise Me that you will meditate, you’ll introspect

172
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,380
than getting into your ego.

173
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,080
Thirdly, you will not criticise Sahaj Yog

174
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,400
— that is God’s own methods —  at any cost!

175
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,160
If you do not understand a part of Sahaj Yog, you can come and ask Me, but don’t criticise!

176
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,420
This is you must promise Me.

177
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,080
So far whatever has happened, has happened.

178
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,540
It’s finished. It’s forgiven. But don’t criticise His ways now anymore,

179
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:22,420
because now you are put into a higher position. You are put into a higher position, today.

180
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:29,400
No more criticism of Sahaj Yog, at any cost, I think!

181
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,840
Because then you criticise God.

182
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,200
If you don't understand - ask Me.

183
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,760
And now you know

184
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,620
you are the people, God has sent only those who really know

185
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,320
that Sahaja Yoga is the ONLY way.

186
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,480
It is revealed to you only, very few people, that this is the Truth.

187
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,080
And this is going to save the whole humanity and all the people.

188
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,140
And God can be ONLY understood through Sahaja Yoga.

189
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:04,240
Nobody is going to decry Sahaja Yoga.

190
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,060
Nor anyone is going to say that, "I am the Sahaja Yoga".

191
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:19,060
Anybody who can say that has been always, so far, we have seen in our practices in Sahaja yoga for the last now so many years,

192
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,600
that anyone who takes up upon to themselves that "I am the Sahaja Yoga"

193
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,740
has had the worst possible falls of all Sahaj Yogis.

194
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,260
Don't do it.

195
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:35,720
We are a part and parcel of that Sahaj Yoga: harmonising people, being one with people.

196
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,720
So nobody should criticise Sahaja Yog.

197
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,340
Nobody should take chances with Sahaja Yog.

198
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,300
And forth: you have to be obedient to Me.

199
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,580
I have been telling you, in a different way

200
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,340
and every way that you should understand.

201
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,340
Now good point.

202
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,340
Today you have done this puja,

203
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,860
I want to tell you that on you Own,

204
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,060
on your free will, with your own understanding

205
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,260
you have to be obedient to Me.

206
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,880
This is your own decision.

207
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,200
I can not force obedience on you,

208
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,280
but you must understand it is for your own good.

209
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:25,020
Because every minute I can see your future, I can see your past, I can see your ascent, I can see everything.

210
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,500
If I say anything at that moment, it may appear a little bit unreasonable, but just obey Me, what I tell you!

211
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,400
I am not asking too much, you have seen: not much, as other gurus do.

212
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
You don’t know other gurus what do they do:

213
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,920
They will hang the disciple in the well half way down.

214
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:47,440
He is just there, from his waste, you see, they will be hanging a rope up.

215
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,600
They take seven parikshas (परीक्षा — trial, test) like this horrible ones.

216
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,320
They will throw him into some place.

217
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,020
7 like this, they are all together 108 parikshas.

218
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:02,800
And then they'll say, "come along". Then they will try [to teach you], it starts after all.

219
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
I am not taking your test.

220
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,340
But obedience is very necessary,

221
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,320
because I know everything.

222
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:18,100
I can't help it, you can not have another opinion about My [ ] because that is it.

223
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,740
And if I say something, I would not say normally,

224
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,380
I will not hurt you, you know that.

225
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,900
I hate to hurt you, after any hurt I cause you I weep and cry.

226
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:34,460
But I have to do it, because you are my dearest children.

227
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,400
And you are My [will] and you have to do the most important thing on Earth so be careful.

228
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:48,040
Whatever I have told you, you have to obey. For today for this place

229
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:56,080
and today's function [ ] these are the three clear restrictions.

230
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,280
I have not asked for much.

231
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,960
But it was very difficult.

232
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,040
They are difficult.

233
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,820
Look after yourself, try to be good sahaja yogis,

234
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,060
be sweet to each other, kind to each other

235
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,540
Don't deceive yourself,

236
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,560
look after your vibrations at everything will work out.
